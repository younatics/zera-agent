"(CNN) -- Gunmen pretending to be an official security force opened fire on police at numerous checkpoints in Haditha, Iraq, early Monday, killing 27, authorities said. Three of the attackers were killed in shootouts with officers, according to Khalid Salman, head of the Haditha local council . In addition to the 27 killed, three officers were wounded, Salman said. At least 14 black SUVs with more than 30 gunmen disguised in SWAT-style uniforms entered the town at about 2 a.m., Salman said. The gunmen were carrying forged arrest warrants for senior police officers. ""Iraqi security forces believe that those attackers drove all the way down from desert areas close to Bayji, about 200 km (124 miles) north of Haditha,"" Salman said. When they arrived at the first police checkpoint on the northern outskirts of town, they ordered all local police officers to turn off their cell phones, Salman said. ""The attackers told local police at that checkpoint that they have arrest warrants issued from Baghdad against two senior police officers in Haditha,"" he said. ""All seven local police at that checkpoint were convinced after the attackers showed them forged arrest warrants, and they agreed to switch off their phones -- and later, all were killed in cold blood."" The gunmen then headed to the Haditha police station, where they convinced officers they were an official force sent by the federal government to carry out the arrests, Salman said. Later, the attackers went to the home of the commander of Haditha's SWAT force, Captain Khalid Daham, and killed him, Salman said. The former commander of emergency police in Haditha, Mohammed Hassan, was also killed inside his house along with two of his bodyguards. At one point, Haditha police officials began to suspect the gunmen. When they asked them to stop until they involve more security officials in their mission, the gunmen began clashes with security forces that lasted an hour, Salman said. Three of the attackers were killed during the clashes, but only one body was left behind, and the attackers managed to flee the town, Salman added. During the clashes, the attackers raised the black flags of Islamic State of Iraq -- an umbrella group which includes al Qaeda in Iraq. The attackers also left some leaflets behind warning Iraqi security that they will carry out more attacks, Salman said. ""This was a serious security breach in the town,"" Salman said. But he said he also blames the central government because in the past, Iraqi security forces have been sent to carry out arrests without notifying the local security forces. ""Those gunmen took advantage of this miscommunication between the central government and the local authorities in Haditha,"" Salman said. ""We hold the Iraqi army full responsible for this incident because they are responsible for securing the highways that link towns and cities with each other,"" the Anbar Provincial Council said in a statement read by Sadoun al-Jumaily, deputy president. The province will hold a three-day mourning period, the council said. Haditha, in Anbar province, is predominantly Sunni town about 360 km (224 miles) west of Baghdad. Anbar was once dominated by Sunni insurgents but is now under control of Iraqi security forces. The province is a vast territory in which Iraq shares borders with Syria, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. Much of the region is desert, and most of the residents live in the towns and cities. The Islamic State of Iraq has been behind numerous recent attacks. On February 23, a series of explosions and shootings killed at least 44 people and wounded more than 200 in Baghdad and elsewhere. The Islamic State of Iraq claimed responsibility. CNN's Josh Levs contributed to this report.","More than 30 gunmen entered the town in disguise .

"(CNN) -- As hosts of the largest carnival in world football, the pressure is on for South Africa's national football team to ignite the imagination of local fans by performing well at the 2010 World Cup. If Bafana Bafana is to succeed in their mission, conventional wisdom would be that coach Carlos Alberto Parreira will turn to his best players to deliver results. However, despite firing in 31 goals in 77 appearances to become South Africa's all-time record goal scorer, Benni McCarthy has had question marks hanging over his participation for his country come June. The prolific striker, who plays for English Premier League side Blackburn Rovers, has only recently returned from a period of international exile, just the latest incident in a stormy history with his country's football team. He first angered Bafana Bafana fans by going into international retirement in 2002 aged just 25. The reason? Traveling to international games was hampering his ability to play European football for Celta Vigo and, later, Porto. ""The whole pattern was killing my career, that's why I quit international football,"" he told British newspaper The Independent in 2004. ""African football needs the same calendar as Europe otherwise its best players are going to suffer."" He was talked into returning, only to quit again after the 2006 Africa Cup of Nations when the president of the South African FA, Mubarak Mahomad, made an uncomplimentary comment about his performance. That period of self-imposed exile lasted 20 months, until new coach Carlos Alberto Parreira flew to Great Britain to talk to McCarthy, who was now at Blackburn Rovers. But after Parreira quit to care for his sick wife, McCarthy fell out with replacement boss Joel Santana after he refused to play in two warm up matches last March. Despite pleas from South African President Jacob Zuma, Santana refused to pick him. But a run of eight defeats in nine games, which saw the team slump to 86th on the FIFA rankings, Santana was sacked. With goals being South Africa's biggest problem, it was no surprise that returning coach Parreira made persuading McCarthy to return, for a second time, his top priority. Sure enough, McCarthy returned to the fray last month against Japan. The 32-year-old told local press: ""I want to start afresh and help Bafana do well in the World Cup finals. It is every player's dream to play for his country... and I have matured."" ""In the past I was a loose cannon and I apologize if I was wrong [but] I am still the best at what I do - and that is scoring goals,"" he added. Few could argue with McCarthy's record. Born in Hanover Park, an impoverished township in Cape Town known for its high unemployment, poverty and gang-related violence, McCarthy escaped to become one of Africa's most successful football exports. McCarthy started his career in 1995 aged 18 with Seven Stars of Cape Town, where 27 goals in 29 games earned him a move to Cape Town Spurs who soon merged with Ajax Cape Town, a feeder side to their famous Dutch namesake. McCarthy's potential was enough for Ajax Amsterdam to sign him. Joining in 1997 he scored nine goals to help them win the Eredivisie in his first year, which eventually attracted the attentions of Spain's Celta Vigo. Although it didn't work out in Spain, his move to Portugal's FC Porto was a roaring success. In the 2003/04 season he helped Jose Mourinho's side win the UEFA Champions League with McCarthy memorably grabbing two goals in the second round defeat of Manchester United. McCarthy moved to Premier League outfit Blackburn Rovers in 2006 and scored plenty of goals - he was in the top three league scorers in his debut season - but first-team opportunities have been limited of late. Yet ever since McCarthy made his international debut in a 2-0 home defeat to Holland 1997, South Africa has been a different side with him in it. Gloom has followed South Africa's footballing exploits before this summer's World Cup. But after his most recent 'comeback', Bafana Bafana fans will hope that McCarthy can help put the dark days under Joel Santana firmly behind them. Hear what Benni has to say in CNN's coverage of the World Cup draw, live on Friday 4th December.","South Africa legend Benni McCarthy is part of CNN's World Cup Draw coverage, Friday 4th December .

"(CNN) -- The European Parliament recently voted on a bill titled ""Eliminating Gender Stereotypes in the EU."" A laudable goal, for sure -- but activists characterized the bill as a Trojan horse with chilling effects on free speech and opinion. The response from the European Parliament left much to be desired in terms of respect for democracy and voters. The bill looked great on the surface -- almost idealistic -- but a closer inspection revealed things that went beyond the appropriate. For instance, the bill called for a blanket ban on any and all forms of pornography -- arguably including anything on the Internet -- as well as concrete measures to enforce the ban. Regardless of whether one thinks pornography has a place in society or should be a protected form of expression, the bill encompassed far more than most would term ""porn."" The language was so vague, and so broad, that it could even criminalize text messages with an ever-so-slightly sexual overtone between husbands and wives. Furthermore, it called for Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to police ordinary people's communications and for dissent against the ban to be criminalized, with ""effective sanctions"" the penalty for opposition. The term ""effective sanctions"" usually means fines or jail. Upon realizing the legislative impact of what had initially been a laudable goal, activists' cries of a Trojan horse didn't seem so far off the mark. Had a bill that criminalized dissent really been voted through all committees and made it as far as the floor of the European Parliament? Several people in parliament discarded the bill and the discussions of it as ""not important"" because it wasn't the final vote in the legislative process, and at this stage was non-binding. Free-speech activists started contacting their representatives en masse though. The message wasn't so much ""don't take away our porn!"" as ""you cannot possibly think this bill, as it is written, is compatible with any kind of fundamental rights."" About 250,000 email messages were sent to the European Parliament on the morning of March 7. Then, something odd happened. Around lunchtime on March 7, the email messages stopped coming into parliament, despite still being sent by individual activists -- hand-typed, individual messages of concern. It turned out that some Members of European Parliament (MEPs) -- to this day, it remains unclear just who -- had complained to technical staff about the amount of constituents seeking contact with their representative on a current issue, and succeeded in having technical staff classify the messages as spam, so they never got through. The notion that one or a few MEPs could use parliamentary technical staff and infrastructure to prevent constituents from contacting any part of parliament on a current issue is jaw-dropping. Not just shutting themselves off, but shutting their colleagues off as well -- shutting off the entire parliament off from its constituents' opinions. Swedish media estimated that one million e-mails were prevented from reaching their representatives. The bill was finally voted through on March 12, but not before the parts that criminalized dissent and turned ISPs into communications police had been taken out. There were still calls for enforcing a blanket ban on pornography, but nothing likely to have a real political effect. It is also impossible for people to hold their politicians accountable on this issue, as the European Parliament did not use a ""roll call vote,"" meaning there is no record of how individuals voted. The idea that a vote can be deliberately constructed in a way that prevents office-holder accountability is astounding. If activists hadn't made a lot of noise on the matter, the parts of the bill that criminalized dissent and turned ISPs into morals police would quite possibly have passed too. I can't help feeling a very bitter aftertaste from the European Parliament's demonstration of how little it cares about the people it represents -- deleting one million attempts by constituents to contact Members of European Parliament, and then declining to create any kind of voting record. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rick Falkvinge.","European Parliament recently voted on ""Eliminating Gender Stereotypes in the EU"" bill .

"(CNN) -- A Jetstar flight with 203 passengers and crew aboard landed safely in Guam early Thursday after a fire broke out in the plane's cockpit, the airline said. A JetStar passenger jet takes off from Changi Airport in Singapore in this 2007 photo. ""It is understood there was smoke in the cockpit followed by the right hand cockpit window area catching fire before being extinguished"" about four hours into the flight, according to a statement from Jetstar. Flight 20 was en route from Osaka to Australia's Gold Coast when the problems developed. The plane was an Airbus A330 -- the same model as the Air France plane from Rio de Janeiro to Paris plunged into the sea with 228 passengers and crew on board last week. A replacement jetliner was set to retrieve the passengers and take them to Brisbane International Airport. The fire in the Jetstar plane follows a similar incident in the cabin of an American Airlines Boeing 767 on Tuesday evening. Flight 64 was on its way from New York to Zurich, Switzerland, when ""some kind of fire"" broke out, forcing the landing in Nova Scotia, a representative of the airline said. There were no injuries and the flight later continued to Switzerland with a replacement aircraft.","Jetstar flight 20 was en route from Osaka to Australia's Gold Coast; is Airbus A330 .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- As familiar and reassuring as the map of the world is, there is only so much that physical geography can tell us about the state of the planet. Forest loss: This cartogram shows areas where the worst deforestation occured from 1990 to 2000. A new book, The Atlas of the Real World, has redrawn the map giving vivid new insights and bringing economic, social and environmental data to life. Not since the German meteorologist, Alfred Wegener, sketched out the first detailed theories of continental drift has the world appeared so misshapen, so otherworldly. The 366 cartograms (statistical maps) which make up the book twist, shrink and distend countries and continents into all sorts of shapes and sizes. The book and the accompanying Web site were devised by Daniel Dorling, professor of human geography at the UK's University of Sheffield, Anna Barford, a research associate at Sheffield and Mark Newman, a professor of physics at the University of Michigan. Work on the project began in earnest in 2006 when Dorling teamed up with Newman, who had co-created a new software technique for creating equal area cartograms the year before. With the software in place, the painstaking task of assembling the data began. The information was drawn from a variety of organizations including the United Nations, the World Health Organization and the World Bank. For ease of visual comparison, territories are split into 12 geographical regions -- e.g. blue for North America, brown for Northern Africa -- and shading marks out specific countries. The range of subjects is impressive, from greenhouse gas emissions, wealth and disease to more obscure data about numbers of dentists and working tractors. John Pritchard, research assistant at University of Sheffield and part of the team working on the project, told CNN: ""I think the maps of disease are particularly shocking and bring home the scale of the problem in Africa better than a table of statistics does."" Indeed, the map of malaria deaths is striking: 94 percent of deaths from malaria occur in Africa, making the continent appear like a vast bloated blob. The rest of the world is reduced to a disparate series of veiny streaks. There are other sobering statistics to consider. In June 2008, Principal Voices spoke to Head of Research at Oxfam GB Duncan Green about strategies to eradicate poverty. Green talked about the education being crucial to breaking the cycle of poverty, particularly for girls. The new atlas's Girls not at Primary School cartogram graphically illustrates the lack of female education in many parts of the developing world. Team members are currently working on a map of languages and soon hope to be producing animated maps. ""We have a series of maps that show deaths at various stages, which would be particularly suited to an animation, and we now have a PhD student looking at extending the Web site, including ways of mapping flow."" Pritchard said.","The Atlas of the Real World brings economic, social and environmental data to life .

"(Financial Times) -- Sony reported its first full-year net profit in five years on Thursday and said it expected earnings to grow by a further 16 per cent this year, helped by restructuring efforts and a weaker yen. The Japanese electronics and entertainment group said net profit for the year that ended in March totalled Y43bn ($435m), a turnround from its massive Y457bn loss a year earlier. For the current year, it expects to earn a profit of Y50bn. Sony was helped in the final quarter by a currency market that knocked almost 20 per cent off the yen's value against the dollar and euro compared with the same period a year earlier, amplifying its overseas earnings. That added to the effect of a restructuring drive through which Sony has axed 10,000 jobs, or about 6 per cent of its workforce, shrunk its lossmaking television manufacturing business and sold its $1bn New York headquarters. Sony booked a profit of Y94bn in the January-to-March quarter, compared with a Y255bn loss a year earlier. Its once-dominant TV operation remained in the red, however. The company has struggled to compete against South Korean and Taiwanese producers in the era of digital flat-screens, and the operation has been losing money for nearly a decade. Forty of Sony's top executives, including Kazuo Hirai, the chief executive since last year, are to give up bonuses worth 30-50 per cent of their pay after they failed to keep a promise to return the division to profit. Sony closed the gap considerably, however, and said it believed it would finally achieve its profitability goal this year. Its consumer electronics loss in the year to March, of Y84bn, was 60 per cent smaller than it was a year earlier. The group's overall earnings forecasts for the year to next March were more modest than those of industry experts. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg before the earnings announcement were projecting a net profit of Y66bn on average. Sony said operating profit -- earnings before tax, depreciation and other adjustments -- would probably remain static this year at Y230bn, even as its sales increase by an expected 10 per cent thanks in part to more advantageous exchange rates. If the yen remains at its current level or weakens further, however, the company could do better than its guidance suggests. Sony based its forecasts on exchange rates of Y90 to the dollar and Y120 to the euro, levels about 8 per cent stronger than the yen's current value. Sony has for some time relied on profits from the banking and insurance operations it owns in Japan to make up for weakness in other businesses. Last year was no different: its financial arm earned a profit of Y149bn, three times more than the next most profitable division, its US-based film studio. © The Financial Times Limited 2013 .","Sony helped in the final quarter by a currency market that knocked almost 20 per cent off the yen's .

"United Nations (CNN) -- World leaders met at the United Nations on Tuesday for the first day of debate at the 67th session of the U.N. General Assembly. Here are five things we learned: . 1. The Syrian conflict is at a stalemate, and the global community can't agree on how to stop the bloodshed. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon opened the day with a strong condemnation of the 18-month crisis in Syria, which has spiraled into a civil war. The situation grows worse by the day, he said, and is no longer limited to that country. ""It is a regional calamity with global ramifications. This is a serious and growing threat to international peace and security, which requires Security Council action,"" he said. Ban's comments were no doubt directed at Russia and China, Security Council members that have repeatedly blocked draft resolutions that would take strong action against the embattled government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. French President Francois Hollande described the situation in Syria as urgent, adding that France -- also a Security Council member -- would recognize a new government as soon as it was officially formed. Earlier, international peace envoy Lakhdar Brahimi said the conflict was at a stalemate. ""There is no prospect for today or tomorrow to move forward."" Brahimi added that he has plans to meet with Russian and Chinese leaders in an effort to forge a lasting solution, and that there were indications the country's anti-government resistance is growing more unified. 2. Time may be running out for a two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Ban and others dived head-first into the controversial issue of Palestinian statehood. Nearly a year after its failed bid to win United Nations recognition as an independent state, the Palestinian Authority is preparing to try again. But unlike last year's attempt, which stalled in the Security Council, the Palestinian Authority is expected this time to seek nonmember observer status, one step up from its current status as a permanent observer. ""The Palestinians must be able to realize their right to a viable state of their own. Israel must be able to live in peace and security, free from threats and rockets. The two-state solution is the only sustainable option, yet the door may be closing for good,"" Ban said. President Barack Obama called on world leaders to ""leave behind those who thrive on conflict, those who reject the right of Israel to exist."" ""The road is hard but the destination is clear -- a secure, Jewish state of Israel; and an independent, prosperous Palestine,"" the U.S. president said. Jordan's King Abdullah II urged both sides to resume full negotiations toward a lasting settlement. ""For almost 65 years, the Palestinian people have been the exception of the U.N. promise,"" he said. ""The shelter of international law and human rights, except not yet."" ""Enough,"" he demanded. 3. The United States will ""do what (it) must"" to stop Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Delivering remarks thought to be as much of a warning to Iran as an assurance to Israel, which has repeatedly threatened a pre-emptive strike, Obama said he remains committed to a diplomatic solution to Iran's disputed nuclear program. But, he warned, ""time is not unlimited."" ""Make no mistake, a nuclear-armed Iran is not a challenge that can be contained,"" Obama said. ""The United States will do what we must to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon."" Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes and to fill energy shortages, but Western leaders believe Tehran is an aspiring armed nuclear power. U.N. inspectors have also expressed doubts about the program's aims. Secretary-General Ban said Iran must prove the ""solely peaceful intent of its (nuclear) program."" 4. Fault lines appear among nations in their reaction to the anti-Islam film that triggered protests in the Muslim world. Several leaders addressed the inflammatory video that mocks the Prophet Mohammed as a womanizer, child molester and killer. The privately produced film sparked protests against the United States, where it was made. While most of the demonstrations were peaceful, some were marred by violence that has left more than two dozen people dead -- among them U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other Americans killed in an attack on the consulate in Benghazi. Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari opened his remarks by commenting on the film. ""I want to express the strongest condemnation for the acts of incitement against the faith of billions of Muslims of the world, and our beloved Prophet Mohamed,"" he said. "" Although we can never condone violence, the international community must not become silent observer, and should criminalize such acts that destroy the peace of the world and endanger the world security by misusing freedom of expression."" Obama, who described the video as ""crude and disgusting,"" said he understood why people would take offense to it as millions of Americans did, too. He stressed the United States had nothing to do with its production, but defended the right of such a film to exist and slammed the violent reaction to it. ""I know there are some who ask why don't we just ban such a video. The answer is enshrined in our laws,"" Obama said. ""There is no speech that justifies mindless violence. There are no words that excuse the killing of innocents. There's no video that justifies an attack on an embassy."" 5. The crisis in the Sahel region of Africa is ""intolerable."" French President Hollande spoke out from the lectern about the Sahel, where a deadly mix of drought, famine and Islamic militancy has unleashed a crisis. ""The situation created by the occupation of territory in the north of Mali by terrorist groups is intolerable,"" he said. The Economic Community of West African States has warned that more than 6 million people are at risk of hunger in the Sahel region of Africa, including more than a million children exposed to severe malnutrition. Ban also addressed the Sahel during his remarks, saying it ""is not getting sufficient attention and support."" The two leaders met to talk about ways to forge a stronger response to the worsening crisis.","NEW: The Middle East, particularly Iran and Syria, dominates the first day .

"(Financial Times) -- The Bank of China has stopped doing business with a large North Korean bank, falling into line with a US-led sanctions push to restrict funding for Pyongyang's nuclear programme. The decision to close the bank account follows an increase in tensions on the Korean peninsula and may be a sign that Beijing is willing to place more pressure on Pyongyang. The US Treasury hit the Foreign Trade Bank, North Korea's main foreign exchange bank, with sanctions in March, saying it was ""a key financial node"" in North Korea's nuclear and missile proliferation activities. The bank had not been named among the institutions targeted for asset freezes by expanded UN Security Council sanctions introduced in January and March. Other countries such as Japan and Australia have since joined the US in applying sanctions against Foreign Trade Bank, but co-operation from banks in China, North Korea's closest economic partner, is essential in the efforts to choke off cash flows. A drive to ""put pressure on Beijing to pressure Pyongyang"" needs to be at the heart of Washington's policy on North Korea, according to Kurt Campbell, until February the US assistant secretary of state for east Asia. ""Bank of China has sent North Korea's Foreign Trade Bank a notice that it has closed its account and has also halted all fund transfers related to this account,"" Bank of China said on Tuesday. It declined to provide any details about how much money was affected or the timing of the move. Bank of China is the country's biggest bank for foreign exchange transactions, so the account closure could hurt the North Korean institution. But the impact is likely to be minimal unless imposed across the board by all Chinese banks because other institutions, including small regional entities, are also capable of handling foreign currency deals. ""This is part of a ratcheting up of pressure but with very clear limits. This is part of making North Korea feel some limited pain in an attempt to get them back to talks,"" said Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, northeast Asia director at the International Crisis Group. The move by Bank of China may also reflect risk management by the bank itself rather than bigger diplomatic motives. The US Treasury had warned financial institutions around the world to be wary of the risks of doing business with Foreign Trade Bank. In 2006 after the US imposed sanctions on Banco Delta Asia, a Macau bank that held North Korean funds, Bank of China responded in similar fashion by freezing North Korean-related assets at its Macau branch. China is by far North Korea's most important formal ally, and overwhelmingly its biggest trading partner. Yet the alliance, which dates back to the Korean war, has long been strained. Analysts say that Pyongyang has persistently refused Chinese attempts to encourage it to emulate Beijing's sweeping economic reforms, and China has grown increasingly alarmed by the regional security implications of North Korea's nuclear weapons programme. Earlier this year Beijing endorsed two sets of new UN Security Council sanctions against Pyongyang, following its long-range rocket launch in December and nuclear bomb test in February. Last month China's President Xi Jinping said that ""no country should be allowed to throw a region and even the whole world into chaos for selfish gains"" -- a comment widely interpreted as a rebuke of North Korea. Many Chinese businesses maintain close trading relationships with North Korea, giving the country access to vital commodities and hard cash. © The Financial Times Limited 2013 .","Bank of China cut business with North Korea's main foreign exchange ban .

"(CNN) -- For once it wasn't Rafael Benitez facing the hard questions. The Chelsea manager has faced a barrage of criticism from fans and media this season, but this week he has led the English club to vital victories in the Premier League, FA Cup and Europa League. By contrast, much of the focus ahead of Sunday's home match against Sunderland was on the struggling team's controversial appointment of manager Paolo Di Canio. Is he a fascist or not? Will he talk about it? Was his hiring a massive misjudgment of public opinion by American owner Ellis Short in this political climate of ultra correctness, especially given Sunderland's strong commercial ties to Africa? It was enough to prompt the resignation of the club's vice-chairman, former British foreign secretary David Miliband, but fan associations have largely been supportive of the Italian's arrival. After Sunday's 2-1 defeat, which left Sunderland outside the relegation zone only on goal difference, Di Canio was questioned about his political beliefs -- but the former member of Italian club Lazio's right-wing hardcore supporters' group refused to dwell on specifics. ""As a person you don't change, but you become an adult, you become a manager,"" he told reporters, who had been asked by Sunderland's press officer not to ask non-football questions, having released a statement earlier in the week insisting he does not support fascist ideology. ""You can also handle your nature because you know now you're not a footballer, now you have responsibility for many others. ""Obviously your nature never changes, but you can lead, you can guide because you know that you have to be careful sometimes when you do something. ""I don't think you are the same person than 20 years ago, 10 years ago. We all change. We maintain the principles of when we were growing up, but we change a bit as a man, now as a manager."" Di Canio, renowned for his colourful gestures as a player in the EPL with West Ham and as a manager with lower league Swindon, had his full repertoire on show at Stamford Bridge. His team took the lead through an own-goal by Cesar Azpilicueta, then conceded their own by Matthew Kilgallon and then went down to a fortunate deflection by Branislav Ivanovic off a shot by Chelsea teammate David Luiz. ""I am more than happy for the first half. Chelsea obviously dominate when they keep the ball, against any other side at Stamford Bridge, but we were very organized,"" Di Canio said. ""The second half was difficult. In the last few days I studied the players and I know exactly what they can give in energy. The two goals came from little mistakes, and we will work to give them more energy in the next few weeks. We have a short time but we are capable."" Benitez has a short time left in his interim Chelsea tenure, but he has many more games scheduled than Sunderland's six. Next Thursday's trip to Russia to face Rubin Kazan in the second-tier Europa League is the start of a run of four games in 10 days for last season's European champions, including an FA Cup semifinal against Manchester City next Sunday and then Premier League trips to Fulham and Liverpool. The London side then have potentially the Europa League semifinals plus four final EPL games in which to secure a place in next season's Champions League. Benitez expects that race to go to the final day of the campaign, despite Chelsea nudging ahead of Tottenham into third place on goal difference. ""Tottenham and Arsenal are pushing, and Everton, so we have to carry on until the end,"" the Spaniard said. ""Hopefully we can do well next week in the cup competitions and after against Fulham and Liverpool. With too many games in a short period of time, it's important to keep the team winning."" Tottenham's tendency for late-season nerves continued on Sunday, with former Chelsea manager Andre Villas-Boas' team needing a late equalizer against sixth-placed Everton. Emmanuel Adebayor put the home side ahead but Everton replied through veteran former England international Phil Jagielka and Greek striker Kevin Mirallas. Togo striker Adebayor then hit the post late on, but Gylfi Sigurdsson -- who scored the leveler in Thursday's Europa League quarterfinal first leg against Basel -- followed up to score from the rebound. It left Spurs level on points with Chelsea and two ahead of fifth-placed Arsenal, having played one more match than both London rivals as they fight for top-four spots. Seventh-placed Liverpool's hopes of European football next season appear over after a 0-0 draw with West Ham that left Brendan Rodgers' team seven points behind Arsenal, having played one more match. At the other end of the table, bottom team Queens Park Rangers' bid to avoid relegation suffered a big blow after conceding an injury-time equalizer against fellow strugglers Wigan. Big-spending QPR had striker Bobby Zamora sent off in the first half for a needless head-high lunge, but took a late lead through France forward Loic Remy's fourth goal in five games. However, Stephane Mbia -- who had set Remy free on goal -- conceded a free-kick and Shaun Maloney curled the set-piece through the QPR wall to put third-bottom Wigan level on points with Sunderland. Newcastle moved five points clear of the relegation battle with a 1-0 win at home to 10th-placed Fulham, as striker Papisse Cisse scored the only goal in time added on.","Sunday's 2-1 win over Sunderland puts Chelsea third in English Premier League .

"(CNN) -- Police believe a Louisiana man abducted his two young sons early Wednesday after breaking into the Florida home of the children's grandmother and tying her up. The boys had been removed from the care of Joshua Michael Hakken and his wife, Sharyn Patricia Hakken, last year, and on Tuesday the couple's parental rights were terminated in Louisiana, investigators say. Hakken, described as an anti-government protester, is believed to be armed, according to the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office in Tampa. Investigators believe his wife is with him. The sheriff's office told CNN there have been ongoing issues with Hakken since he attended an anti-government rally somewhere in Louisiana in June of last year. He was arrested at the rally on multiple drug charges, officials said. Louisiana authorities have told Florida investigators that the children were initially placed in temporary foster care after being taken away from the Hakkens. Sometime later, investigators allege, the couple went to the foster care center, armed, and tried unsuccessfully to enter it. At some point over the past few months, the children were sent to Tampa to live with their grandmother, Patricia Hauser, the mother of Sharyn Hakken. ""Somehow they found out where the kids were and an Amber Alert is being issued now,"" said Detective Larry McKinnon of the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office. Sheriff's investigators say Hakken entered Hauser's home at 6:30 a.m. Wednesday. She has told police that he tied her up and fled with the children in her silver 2009 Toyota Camry. That vehicle was found later in the day just a couple of blocks away from the home. The sheriff's office said the children now could be in a black 2006 GMC pickup registered to Hakken. Authorities said the abducted children are Chase Hakken, 2, and Cole Hakken, 4. Both have brown hair and brown eyes and were last seen wearing pajamas. ""We suspect that the wife is with him. He has a history of being armed,"" McKinnon said. Investigators have brought in the FBI to help them track the family, who could have left the state of Florida by Wednesday afternoon.","The children had been taken from Joshua and Sharyn Hakken last year, investigators say .

"(EW.com) -- ""The Office"" ends its nine-season run this month, and rumors have been swirling with respect to how the stories will wrap up and who will return to say goodbye. At the forefront of the rumors is former ""Office"" star Steve Carell, who led the Dunder Mifflin crew as General Manager Michael Scott for seven seasons. His particular delivery of Scott's insensitive and naive dialogue drew many viewers to the show, and fans are desperate for news of his return. NBC announces 'The Office' retrospective special . Predictions Monday by TV Line have narrowed a Carell appearance to a cameo, having confirmed by unnamed sources that Michael Scott will indeed return for a final farewell moment. Last week on ""Late Show With David Letterman,"" Mindy Kaling claimed not to remember if Carell would be in the finale or not. When pressed, she said she had signed a nondisclosure agreement and didn't want to lie to Letterman. 'The Office' debuts farewell web series featuring Will Ferrell, more . In a conference call with reporters last week, show creator Greg Daniels danced around the query, saying, ""I think Steve felt, and I agree, that the 'Goodbye, Michael' episode was his goodbye and he didn't want to overshadow the ending that all the other characters deserved."" Daniels didn't specifically say that an appearance by the former boss was out of the question, only that he left on a good note. NBC has not yet returned EW's request for comment.

"New York (CNN) -- More than 200 people received hepatitis A vaccinations over the weekend after learning that a Manhattan restaurant employee handling sweets was infected with the virus, according to the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Patrons of the Alta tapas restaurant in Manhattan's West Village from March 23 to April 2 could have been exposed. Of the 239 people who received vaccinations over the weekend, 31 were restaurant employees. The restaurant believes that about 3,000 people ate at Alta tapas during the time frame, 15% of whom -- or 450 -- ordered dessert. As of Friday, there were no confirmed cases, according to the health department, but officials advise guests who ordered desserts during the time in question to get the shot as a precaution. The health department warned the public about the infected employee Friday and began offering free vaccinations to restaurant patrons through the weekend and will continue to do so Monday. The department did not say whether there is concrete evidence that the virus ended up in food. Efforts to reach the restaurant owner Sunday were unsuccessful. Hepatitis A spreads by mouth via traces of fecal matter from an infected person, the Health Department said. If people do not wash their hands before handling food, the food could become infected even though it might look clean. The virus infects the liver and causes jaundice, which is the yellowing of the skin and eyes, fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea and diarrhea. There is no specific treatment once symptoms appear. Hepatitis A is rarely fatal, although those with liver disease or a weakened immune system could require hospitalization, according to the health department. An average of 65 cases of Hepatitis A occur in New York City each year, with one or two occurring in food handlers, according to the health department. The restaurant owner on Friday said that the infected employee is no longer ""on the premises."" Scores of Tulsa dental patients tested for hepatitis, HIV exposure .

"(CNN) -- It may have one of the fastest growing economies in the world -- but if you're young and out of work in Africa, the future remains bleak. The search for employment is a daily struggle for 24-year-old Sherrif Mohamed. He's one of millions of young unemployed Africans whose lives have stalled, despite economic growth across the continent. Sherrif lives in Egypt, where until recently he was pursuing a university education. The revolution that ousted Hosni Mubarak forced him out of school and into a job market, which has continued to worsen. The uprising kept tourists away and investors out -- and Egypt is yet to recover. Around 30% of 18 to 29-year-olds are now out of work -- a figure that's echoed across Africa. Sherrif's lack of a qualification narrows his employment prospects further. ""Now there are no jobs whatsoever,"" he said. ""I've tried working in restaurants, coffee shops, clothing stores and lately worked at my brother's store. But the wages are not sustainable at all."" Thousands of miles away in Kenya, more disillusioned young adults walk the corridors of the University of Nairobi. Unlike Sherrif, they'll get to complete their studies and enter the job market as skilled professionals. But with Kenya's youth unemployment rate standing at 40%, they feel their prospects of work are equally slim. Eunice Kilonzo is a promising student on the campus. She said: ""I'm competing with around 700 people to get the same job, probably in the same place. So the chance of getting a job is pretty thin."" She places the blame firmly at the feet of her government. Eunice feels the job market will not improve in line with economic growth until the education system is revamped. ""If the market is way beyond your education level, there won't be productivity. We need to change everything about the education system. I cannot go into the library and study a book that was published in 1969. We are in 2012."" For Eunice and Sherriff, economic forecasts make for irrelevant reading. Africa's economy is expected to grow by 4.5% this year and by 4.8% the next, and its youth population is set to double by 2045, according to the African Economic Outlook report. But the headlines that herald a burgeoning economy aren't translating into the jobs they need. If jobless growth continues, they believe young Africans will continue to find themselves unemployed or, more frequently, underemployed in informal jobs. World Bank Chief Economist Shantayanan Devarajan agrees that creating employment is the biggest hurdle that African nations will have to overcome. ""In low income African countries people can't afford to be unemployed. They are working in the informal sector with very low earnings and very low productivity. ""One reason for that low productivity is that these people have had very little education. ""On the other hand it's a huge opportunity because we can train them and can improve the quality of education. The other point is the rest of the world is aging, so Africa will become the place with all the young people."" The African Economic Outlook report also speaks of the importance of unlocking the potential offered by the region's youth. But it says the continent must modernize its industries and develop sustainable private sectors, in order to do so. While, such harsh warnings are not relevant for all of Africa, the sentiment behind them is important. Devarajan agrees that private firms could provide an important source of jobs for the young and says African businessmen are taking advantage of the opportunities available now. ""Macroeconomic policies in Africa have improved inexorably in the last 10 to 15 years,"" he added. ""We've had commodity price booms in the past but those haven't translated to this kind of sustained growth before. And that means there is hope for a better future for Africa. This is not hype, this is real.""","Africa's economy set to grow by 4.5% this year, youth population to double by 2045 .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A series of e-mail exchanges between officials at the Department of Health and Human Services shows growing alarm at the amount of projected profit from a government contract for a drug company whose controlling shareholder is a longtime Democratic Party activist. Ronald Perelman is controlling shareholder of Siga Technologies and a longtime Democratic Party activist and fundraiser. He's also a large contributor to Republicans, but has been a particular friend of the Obama White House. Also on Siga's board of directors is Andy Stern, former president of the Service Employees International Union, who has had close relations with the Obama administration and who has supported President Barack Obama's health care initiatives. In May 2011, Health and Human Services awarded Siga a no-bid contract worth nearly $433 million to develop and produce 1.7 million doses of an anti-viral smallpox drug called STS-246. The drug would augment the existing supply of smallpox vaccine now in U.S. control. According to HHS officials, the government has already spent close to $1 billion to acquire smallpox vaccine since the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. A government spokesman told CNN that STS-246 is designed to be given over a 14-day course of treatment, with two pills a day suggested in the event of a smallpox outbreak triggered by a bio-terror attack. But internal e-mails obtained exclusively by CNN show a contracting officer assigned to manage price negotiations between HHS and Siga was alarmed at the cost. Siga's return on investment, one e-mail said, was ""an overwhelming 180 per cent."" The e-mail went on to say that margin ""must be cut in half at a minimum"" and later added: ""I know you won't find a CO (Contracting Officer) in government who would sign a 3-digit profit percentage."" In reply, another HHS official, a doctor, agreed. ""Fully concur that 180 per cent is outrageous,"" the doctor said in an answer. Moreover, because taxpayer dollars had been used to fund research and development of the drug, ""We should get a major discount given our support of front-end development,"" the e-mail states. A few weeks later, the CEO of Siga, Dr. Eric A. Rose, wrote to HHS, saying ""it was clear that we were at an impasse in negotiations"" and urging government officials to remove the existing contracting officer and replace him ""with a more senior official."" The assistant secretary for preparedness and response, Nicole Lurie, agreed. In a letter to Rose, she told him she had instructed her officials ""to appoint our most senior procurement official as the final authority for this procurement."" Shortly thereafter, the contract was signed. The contract award immediately raised concerns in some sections of the scientific community. One smallpox expert, Dr. D.A. Henderson of the University of Pittsburgh's Bio Security Center, said STS-246 has not been proven to work. ""The question is, what will it do in the way of treating a patient who's had a fever and now has a funny rash that could be smallpox?"" Henderson told CNN. ""Will it treat the disease? I've seen no data to suggest that it will."" The Republican chairmen of two House committees, Oversight and Investigations and Small Business, both wrote to HHS demanding all correspondence associated with the contract award and have begun an investigation. ""You certainly can't ignore the political connections between the company and the administration,"" Missouri Rep. Sam Graves, the chairman of the Small Business Committee, told CNN. For its part, Siga told CNN in an e-mail that: ""Never at any time was any elected official or political official asked to intervene in the procurement process by SIGA or anyone affiliated with the company."" Read Siga's statement . But a key Democratic senator wants an investigation of the contract. Sen. Claire McCaskill, also of Missouri, says the no-bid award raises serious questions. ""Was it justified as a no-bid contract?"" McCaskill asked in a press conference last week. ""Overall, I think we need to begin asking policy questions about the kind of money we're spending developing drugs where the United States is the only customer."" A White House spokesman declined to comment to CNN and instead referred all questions to Health and Human Services. In a written statement, an HHS spokesman said the contract was awarded ""after a rigorous market analysis determined that Siga was the only known company in the world with the capability to produce the required antiviral drug within the required time period."" A smaller drug firm based in Durham, North Carolina -- Chimerix -- had earlier told government auditors that it could develop a similar drug. Chimerix was then given the opportunity to bid for any additional funds beyond the original contract. HHS also told CNN that the price of the drug was of no concern. ""We can't get into the details, but the final rates ended up well within industry standards,"" the spokesman said. As for replacing the contract officer, the spokesman said: ""This change actually resulted in substantial savings for the U.S. government."" That's something McCaskill questions. ""If the United States government is going to be the only customer, why is it that the stockholders get all the profit if we're the ones putting up a significant portion of the development money when, in fact, the United States becomes the only customer?"" she asked. As for the replacement of the HHS official, Siga said in its e-mail to CNN: . ""The findings, the negotiations and the decision to award were handled solely by career procurement officials at HHS who negotiated a fair and reasonable price."" Siga board member Fran Townsend, appearing on CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" Thursday night, defended the contract process and insisted it followed standard operating procedures. ""I can tell you not Ronald Perelman, not Andy Stern, no member of the (Siga) board was involved in these contract negotiations and never contacted anybody in the government about this contract,"" said Townsend, who works full time for McAndrews and Forbes, a company owned by Perelman, and who also is CNN national security contributor. Townsend contended that the contract was put out in a competitive process but ""Chimerix ultimately was not competitive in this process."" ""It ultimately was ... a sole-source contract ... because there was nobody to compete,"" Townsend said. ""There was nobody (aside from Siga) with an anti-viral that could meet the government's standards."" She added that the government has given a research-and-development grant to Chimerix to encourage competition. ""The government has bent over backwards to try and balance the need for an anti-viral against competition,"" Townsend said. Townsend also said the claim that Siga's return on investment was 180% was ""inaccurate."" However, she said the actual rate was confidential. She pointed out that an FDA advisory committee will be holding a public hearing on the drug on December 14. Internal HHS documents obtained by CNN also show that as part of the early negotiation process, two key Siga executives granted themselves salary increases of $200,000 in the case of CEO Eric A. Rose and $225,000 for Siga Chief Financial Officer Daniel Luckshire. According to the internal memo, dated January 14, 2011, Siga ""now believes a pending government award merits bonuses for the most highly paid executives.""","In May 2011, Siga Technologies won a no-bid, nearly $433 million HHS contract .

"New York (CNN) -- Jewish and Christian groups have unveiled three separate ad campaigns to counter what they claim is hateful speech toward Muslims contained within an advertisement posted at some New York City subway stations. The new ads tout religious tolerance and offer support to the Muslim community. ""Help stop bigotry against our Muslim neighbors,"" reads one. ""Support peace in word and deed,"" reads another. The campaigns are in response to a controversial ""Defeat Jihad"" ad that is displayed in 10 of the city's more than 400 subway stations. It reads: ""In any war between the civilized man and the savage, support the civilized man. Support Israel. Defeat Jihad."" New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority initially rejected the ad, which was produced by the American Freedom Defense Initiative. But the authority's decision was overturned when a federal judge ruled that the ad is protected speech under the First Amendment. Interfaith group protests ad that says ""Support Israel. Defeat Jihad"" Jihad -- Arabic for ""struggle"" -- is considered a religious duty for Muslims, although there are both benign and militant interpretations of what it means. ""We, as an organization of rabbis want to make it clear to New York and to the U.S. that neither rabbis nor the mainstream Jewish community support this dehumanization, but in fact we value partnership with our Muslim neighbors and Muslim organizations,"" said Rabbi Jill Jacobs, of Rabbis for Human Rights, one of the three groups behind the new ads. The other groups are Sojourners, a Christian faith-based social justice group, and United Methodist Women. Jacobs described an outpouring of support from individual donors in response to the ""Defeat Jihad"" ad, which allowed for the purchase of 20 new ads. They are expected to be posted in city subway stations Monday, said Jacobs. Timothy King, of Sojourners, said his group will debut 10 ads, also Monday, in close proximity to the ""Defeat Jihad"" ads. ""We are going to go out of our way to make sure Muslims are treated well here, and we hope our fellow Christians will be treated well abroad,"" King said. United Methodist Women have already posted its ads around Manhattan, according to Harriet Olson, the group's general secretary. Meanwhile, Pamela Geller, executive director of the American Freedom Defense Initiative, defended the controversial ""Defeat Jihad"" ad, saying there is nothing hateful about it. ""My own ad is not hate speech. It's love speech. It's love of life speech,"" she told CNN in an e-mail Friday. Regarding her critics, Geller said: ""Their moral myopia is immense. They are confusing resistance to hatred with actual hatred."" Opinion: Subway ads -- A right to hate speech, a duty to condemn .

"(CNN)  -- Race fans have a big Memorial Day weekend ahead. Open-wheel cars at the Indianapolis 500. Stock cars at the Coca-Cola 600. A dragon made of aluminum scrap was one of the entries in 2008's Kinetic Grand Championship in California. But if you need a different sort of racing fix, maybe you'd be into fire-breathing aluminum dragons. Friday kicks off Northern California's annual Kinetic Grand Championship, a three-day race in which teams aboard pedal-powered works of art move across 42 miles of road, sand and water. Thousands of spectators, some following the competitors on bikes of their own, watch kinetic sculptures like a picnic basket and a psychedelically painted hippo race from Arcata to Ferndale in California's Humboldt County. Sculpture racing isn't the only thing that may satisfy those thirsting for a different kind of race. At other times of the year, souped-up lawnmowers cut through tight turns in Indiana, and women sprint with pancakes in Kansas, just to name two.  See pictures of the races » . But we start with California's kinetic sculpture event, just one day away. Yes, it breathes fire . The Kinetic Grand Championship bills itself as the oldest race of its kind. It started in 1969 when renowned welding artist Hobart Brown challenged someone to a welded-contraption race in Ferndale, California. Now, about 40 teams create art of varying complexity and attach it to something that can be pedaled on land and float on water. For the floating part -- the sculptures go into Humboldt Bay on Day 2 -- some have tires big enough for the job. Others rely on pontoons. ""We call it the triathlon of the art world,"" race director Harmony Groves said. ""It brings together art, engineering and bicycling -- and fun."" Some machines are one-seaters with two wheels; others have many wheels and seat eight. Duane Flatmo, a 51-year-old muralist and graphic artist, built a dragon out of aluminum scrap like muffin tins and colanders. ""Any kind of aluminum I could find,"" said Flatmo, a Eureka resident who's been racing since 1982. ""Any time I would go to the junk store, there'd be piles of aluminum stuff, and I said, 'That's my material right there.' "" The dragon, which he and his Biking Vikings team will race again this year, has a trick up its wings. ""The head swings from side to side and up and down -- it's all levers and cables,"" Groves said. ""And he can pull a cable that connects to a propane tank, and fire comes out of its mouth."" Not that fire has anything to do with racing, but it does relate to fun -- something the event takes seriously. The Biking Vikings wore horned helmets last year. The Hippypotomus team dressed like hippies and played a marimba in the back. A prize is given for the fastest time, but awards also are offered for the sculpture that breaks down first or has the best flip-over in water. Racers can use team-themed pieces of art to bribe judges who catch them pushing their rides. Organizers encourage spectators to follow the shenanigans by standing along the course or by biking it, as long as they follow certain rules. Start your lawnmower engines . In Twelve Mile, Indiana, organizers of what's billed as the nation's oldest lawnmower race aren't sure why their Lions Club predecessors picked that machine for an annual fundraiser 46 years ago. But with each July 4 race day drawing more than 1,000 people to an unincorporated community where maybe 150 live, they aren't about to second-guess. The Twelve Mile 500 Riding Lawnmower Race is actually two 60-lap, 15-mile races at the local park -- one for regular lawnmower engines, and the other for ""modified"" mowers, those whose power trains have been replaced with those of, say, a motorcycle. See video of the races . But even the regular engines can be altered, and most of these machines can get up to 35 mph, organizer and Lions Club member Mark Lowe said. The ""modified"" machines can go much faster if a rider is so inclined, he said. However, the races -- each featuring up to 33 drivers, like the Indianapolis 500 roughly 80 miles to the south -- have a 15 mph speed limit because officials don't want out-of-control machines on the winding dirt track. Drivers caught speeding are penalized, but the winners still average above 15 mph. Racers aren't forced to remove the blade decks, but virtually no one races with them because no one wants them impeding their speed, Lowe said. Spectators pack the park and watch from lawn parties at nearby homes. Adults at the park pay $5, and kids 12 and under are charged up to $1. Winners normally get a used car from a local dealer, though the economy may force a different prize this year. 415-yard dash for pancake glory . Fat Tuesday. Mardis Gras. Shrove Tuesday. Whatever you call it, the women of Liberal, Kansas, and Olney, England, know it's the day they run their pancake race. The International Pancake Day race is a friendly Liberal-Olney battle that's been happening since 1950. Women in Olney, donning aprons and head scarves, run a 415-yard race on an S-shaped street course while holding a skillet with a pancake at 11:55 a.m. the day before Lent. Women in Liberal -- they have to be residents -- do the same when that time hits Kansas six hours later. Why? In 1445, a woman in Olney was late to church on Shrove Tuesday. She'd been making pancakes, and when she heard the church bells, she ran to the service -- carrying a skillet and pancake. Neighbors saw this and a race was born, according to an International Pancake Day Web site. The Olney tradition was revived in the early 1900s. A Liberal man saw a photo of Olney's race in 1950 and reached out to the English town to start the current two-community contest, said Janice Northerns, Liberal's Pancake Day publicity chairwoman. The winners of the two races compare times -- these days by video conferencing -- and an international winner is crowned. Racers have to flip the pancake at the finish to prove they have it. But unlike the woman in 1445, racers aren't concerned what kind of shape the pancake is in. ""Most racers hold it in the skillet with their thumb"" so they can pump their arms, Northerns said. ""If most of it falls out but some remains, that's OK.""","Offbeat races can be found across the country at various times of the year .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama is getting a lot of free advice. Here's a question, not an answer: With every issue in the Middle East intertwined with every other, like a giant bowl of spaghetti, where do you begin? In reality, no matter where you begin in the Middle East, each strand connects to almost every other: . Syria? Immediately you must think of the Turks who are harboring refugees and fighters just across the border, and Syrian Kurds, who are beginning to harbor thoughts of autonomy and are increasing contacts with their ethnic brothers in Iraq and Turkey. Iran, of course, is aiding the beleaguered Bashar al-Assad but also trying to organize an exit strategy; Saudi Arabia and Qatar are pouring money and arms into the country with the sole purpose of cracking the Syria-Iran entente; Iraq fears that a Sunni takeover in Syria will revitalize its own restless Sunnis. The Palestinian issue? No need to elaborate. That is tangled up with everything in the Middle East. The Arab awakening? The policies you adopt with the emerging Islamist governments will affect every strand you touch in the region, from relations with Israel to the Arab states in the Persian Gulf that are terrified of sweeping change. The president will not have the luxury of choosing a single issue and ignoring or postponing all the others. The whole Middle East has a habit of intruding, and policy choices will have to be made about each of the major issues, even if it is not convenient. Still, in plotting a second term, the president must establish some priorities. Trying to do everything at once is not only bad strategy, it is a certain recipe for failure across the board. A point of entry: Possibly the most promising strand to pull when trying to unravel the Mideast problem is the Iranian dilemma. When Obama came into office four years ago, he courageously promised to engage Iranian leaders. He made a genuine attempt, but he quickly pulled back in the face of Iran's brutal suppression of a civil uprising, Israeli demands for an early deadline on the nuclear issue and the fact that he had a lot on his domestic plate. Trita Parsi evocatively describes that episode in the book ""A Single Roll of the Dice."" There was no staying power. Instead, the United States reverted to its default position of sanctions while maintaining the framework for serious negotiations with Iran as part of the so-called P5+1 -- the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council (the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia) plus one (Germany). The sanctions did their job. Iran has gladly accepted the invitation of the P5+1 to return to the negotiating table. However, in the run-up to the presidential election, the United States was unwilling to put a meaningful offer on the table, and the negotiating track languished in a kind of limbo. The value of sanctions: Sanctions have two useful purposes. One is to persuade Iran to return to the negotiating table. That has happened. The other is to give the sanctioning party something to bargain away in return for concessions. Up to this point, the United States has been unwilling to offer significant sanctions relief in return for significant concessions from Iran. Sanctions have assumed a life of their own and are gradually becoming politically untouchable. If that remains true, then there is no prospect of serious negotiations. There is another use of sanctions -- to punish a party you don't like and potentially coerce them into submission or collapse. The current sanctions regime is taking on that coloration, even if it is seldom discussed as such. The record of sanctions in producing abject surrender or regime change is not promising. Instead, the sanctions typically hurt the average citizen, while leaders escape most of the effects and adopt a defiant posture, blaming their own failings on outside interference. This is beginning to happen in Iran today. Vicious assaults on the well-being of a country's population can produce popular bitterness and hostility against the ""enemy"" that can last for generations. The shape of an agenda: As with many long-standing disputes, the broad outlines of a settlement are well-known to the parties. What is lacking is the political judgment by both sides that now is the moment to proceed with a deal that will require mutual compromise. The United States and its allies will have to accept a measure of Iranian domestic enrichment of uranium. Iran will have to accept limits on its entire nuclear infrastructure, subject to intrusive inspections and monitoring. Iran will need to document the history of its nuclear program, and the West will need to remove sanctions. All of this must happen in a step-by-step process with safeguards and verifications at each stage. There is nothing easy about it. The Iranians are known as obstinate and often infuriating negotiators. The United States is not known for its patience, and it can be clumsy and ponderous as it attempts to please multiple constituencies at the same time. Iran is certain to face strong objections from its hardliners, and the same will apply in the United States. The hardliners on both sides, who regard another Middle East war as an acceptable option, reinforce each other and impede efforts to find mutually acceptable compromises. Israel and the U.S. Congress will try to impose impractically tight deadlines. And events in the region, such as the recent case of Iranian aircraft firing on a U.S. surveillance drone, can sabotage negotiations. The Arab states of the Gulf will be intensely suspicious of any hint of a secret deal between the United States and Iran. They remember America's strategic reliance on the shah, the Reagan administration's covert sale of weapons to Iran in the mid-1980s and America's installation of a Shia government in Iraq. They (and Israel) will have to be persuaded that any accommodation with Iran is not at their expense. Private and public negotiations: The starting point must be private U.S.-Iran discussions, leading to an agreed agenda. Both sides have recently hinted that such talks are under consideration, and reactions from the European Union, Russia and even the American people have been undismayed, even openly supportive. The choice of representatives and venues is less important than confidence that delegates credibly reflect the view of their leaders. Experience suggests that an agreed agenda is more likely to emerge from bilateral discussions outside the glare of publicity. If that is accomplished, then the actual negotiations could be carried out within the existing P5+1 framework. Even a preliminary agreement -- establishing a mutually acceptable process with a defined end point -- would help to unravel some of the tangles of Middle East issues. The threat of a new war in the Middle East would be reduced. The possibility of getting Iranian cooperation on Syria would be improved. The threat of nuclear proliferation in the region would be tamped down at least temporarily. And the multiple flash points in the Gulf could potentially cool down, leaving opportunities for more constructive initiatives. The history of U.S.-Iran relations is a story of relentless hostility and serial missed opportunities. Chances for genuine progress come along scarcely once in a decade. So, Mr. President, here is one more piece of free advice: The present constellation of circumstances with Iran is probably the best you're going to get. Don't let it pass.

"(CNN) -- Immediately after the September 11, 2001, terrorist acts, Sikhs came under attack. Mistaken for Muslims because of their beards and turbans, they became ripe targets for zealots seeking revenge. The first person murdered in retaliation for the 9/11 attacks was a Sikh -- a gas station owner in Mesa, Arizona, named Balbir Singh Sodhi who was shot five times by aircraft mechanic Frank Roque. In the intervening years, the Sikh Coalition, a New York-based advocacy group, reported more than 700 attacks or bias-related incidents. Belief Blog: Who are Sikhs? Some Sikhs had their houses vandalized; others were spat upon. In some extreme cases, Sikhs were set upon by groups of people and beaten. As the incidents waned, the community had hoped the worst was behind them -- until Sunday, when a man shot and killed at least six people at a Sikh temple outside Milwaukee, wounded a police officer and was himself killed by another officer's bullets. Wade Michael Page, 40, an Army veteran, was the gunman and was killed by an officer at the scene, police said Monday. Witnesses said the gunman had a 9/11 tattoo on one arm. Police have received information that the suspect ""may have been involved in"" the white supremacist movement, but that has not been confirmed, Oak Creek Police Chief John Edwards said. While the shooter's motives are not yet known, what is clear is that the incident has dredged up the sense of shock and sadness Sikhs felt 11 years ago. Rajwant Singh, from the Maryland-Sikh Council on Religion and Education, said Sikhs growing up in the United States should not feel as though they don't belong. ""Everybody should feel at home,"" he said Sunday. ""This nation belongs to everyone."" But little seems to have changed. The United States is home to about 700,000 Sikhs, nearly all of Indian origin. The men are easily identifiable by their beards and turbans, a tradition that's lasted for 500 years. Today, we are all American Sikhs . But the attire and appearance have also meant that they are often mistaken for Muslims, and are targets of anti-Islam attacks. ""Our appearance looks like Osama bin Laden and those of Afghanistan,"" Suminder Sodhi, a friend of the Arizona victim, said at the time of the first attack. ""But we are different people from Muslim people. We have different beliefs, a different religion."" Because many of the incidents go unreported and because the FBI doesn't specifically list them -- instead lumping them as ""anti-Islamic"" crimes -- exact numbers are hard to come by. Earlier this year, New York Rep. Joe Crowley sent a letter to the Justice Department to begin tracking crimes against Sikhs. He asked that the FBI update its Hate Crime Incident Report Form (1-699), which does not have a designation for crimes against Sikhs as it does for some other groups. ""The more information our law enforcement agencies have on violence against Sikh-Americans, the more they can do to help prevent these crimes and bring those who commit them to justice,"" Crowley said. Here are some instances from the long list of attacks that Sikhs have faced since 9/11: . -- September 15, 2001: Roque guns down Sodhi outside a Mesa gas station. Roque drives up to the station, fires five times and flees. He goes on to shoot at a Lebanese-American gas station clerk and fire into the home of an Afghan-American family later the same day. He is serving a life sentence. -- December 2001: Two men beat store owner Surinder Singh 20 times with metal poles in Los Angeles while they utter, ""We'll kill bin Laden today."" -- March 2004: Vandals scrawl the words, ""It's not your country"" in blue spray paint on the wall of the Gurdwara Sahib temple in Fresno, California. The temple was also vandalized a year earlier. -- July 2004: Rajinder Singh Khalsa is beaten unconscious by six men in New York City, after they taunt him and his friend about their turban. The beating leaves Khalsa with multiple fractures. -- August 2006: Iqbal Singh is stabbed in the neck with a steak knife in San Jose, California, while he is standing in the carport of his house. The attacker later tells police he wanted to ""kill a Taliban."" -- October 2008: Ajit Singh Chima is punched and kicked in the head while out on his daily walk in Carteret, New Jersey. The attacker does not take anything from Chima. -- January 2009: Jasmir Singh is attacked outside a New York grocery store, with men shouting racial slurs. Two years later, his father is attacked. -- November 2010: Two passengers beat Harbhajan Singh, a Sikh cabdriver, in Sacramento, California, with one of them calling him ""Osama bin Laden."" -- March 2011: Gurmej Singh Atwal and Surinder Singh are gunned down in Elk Grove, California, while out on their afternoon walk. They are not robbed and had no enemies, family members say. -- February 2012: A Sikh temple under construction in Sterling Heights, Michigan, is defaced, with graffiti on the wall depicting a gun and a Christian cross. Someone also scrawls ""Mohmed,"" perhaps in reference to the Muslim prophet Mohammed. Sikhs react to the Wisconsin temple shooting . Sikhism, the world's fifth most popular religion, is a monotheistic faith that believes in equality and service to others, Sikh officials say. CNN's Julie In contributed to this report.","Mistaken for Muslims because of their beards and turbans, Sikhs have become targets .

"(CNN) -- Barcelona clinched a 22nd Spanish league title on Saturday when second-placed Real Madrid could only draw 1-1 at Espanyol. Real's failure to win gave Barca back the crown after a one-year change in ownership, with Tito Vilanova's team holding a seven-point advantage ahead of Sunday's trip to Atletico Madrid. Real coach Jose Mourinho made several changes following the midweek 6-2 win over Malaga, with next Friday's Copa del Rey final against Atletico in mind. However, Barcelona-based Espanyol took the lead in the 23rd minute through Christian Stuani, and Hector Moreno was unlucky to have a header ruled out following a seemingly innocuous goalmouth tussle with Xabi Alonso. Midfielder Alonso had come on in the 19th minute after young French defender Raphael Varane went off injured, while Mourinho brought on striker Karim Benzema at halftime. The later introduction of top scorer Cristiano Ronaldo led to Real's 58th-minute equalizer as the Portugal forward won a free-kick which Luka Modric delivered perfectly for striker Gonzalo Higuain to head home. Tempers flared as Real pressed for a winner to delay their rivals' title confirmation, and Espanyol's Victor Sanchez was sent off for a crude late tackle on Higuain while 10 other bookings were handed out in the match. Ronaldo had the chance to conjure up one of his trademark free-kicks after Sanchez departed, but blazed the ball into the stands. It continued Real's poor away form, having drawn four and lost five games of 18 on the road, compared to 16 wins and two draws at home. Earlier, Osasuna moved four points clear of the relegation zone with a 1-0 win at home to eighth-placed Getafe, while Athletic Bilbao all but secured another year in the top flight with a 2-1 win over bottom club Mallorca. Valladolid secured safety with three games to play as a 1-0 win over Deportivo la Coruna left the visitors third from bottom. Italy . Juventus' bid to beat the club's best Serie A points tally was foiled after the Italian champions drew 1-1 with Cagliari in Saturday's penultimate match of the season for the Turin side. Antonio Conte's team had hoped to beat the 91 posted by the Juve team in 2005-06 before being stripped of the title because of a match-fixing scandal, but can now only get to 90. The record is Inter Milan's 97 in in 2006-07. Victor Ibarbo put visiting Cagliari ahead in the 12th minute but striker Mirko Vucinic leveled just after the hour mark, and Juve could not extend the club's winning run to 10 matches. Catania consolidated ninth place with a 1-0 win over relegated Pescara. Germany . Champions Bayern Munich romped to a 28th victory from 33 games, winning 3-0 against Augsburg in a Bavarian derby which kicked off title celebrations as the team finally received the trophy which had been secured a month ago. The defeat left Augsburg in the relegation playoff place, on goal difference behind Fortuna Dusseldorf ahead of the final round. Borussia Dortmund, who will play Bayern in the Champions League final, clinched second place with a 3-3 draw at Wolsfburg, needing two late goals from Marco Reus to salvage a point. Bayer Leverkusen consolidated third place with a 3-1 win over Hanover -- the last goal from Steffen Kiessling put the German striker one ahead of Dortmund's Robert Lewandowski at the top of the Bundesliga scoring charts on 24. Schalke failed to clinch the fourth and final Champions League place after losing 2-1 at home to Stuttgart, whose Bosnia striker Vedad Ibisevic netted both goals to take his tally to 15 this season -- putting him third equal with Bayern's Mario Mandzukic and Eintracht Frankfurt's Alexander Meier. Fifth-placed Freiburg can go above Schalke by beating the German Cup finalists in the last round, but Frankfurt's hopes were effectively ended by a 1-1 draw with Werder Bremen. France . Second-placed Marseille made Paris Saint-Germain wait for a first title since 1994 by beating Toulouse 2-1 on Saturday, as Ghana striker Andre Ayew scored both goals on his return from suspension. The result left PSG with a four-point lead ahead of Sunday's trip to Lyon, after which there will be two rounds left. Monaco clinched a return to Ligue 1 with a 1-0 win at Nimes, ensuring there will be conflict with the French football authorities next season. The principality club is taking legal action after the ruling body announced that it wants to change the tax laws that allow Monaco to pay less than other clubs across the border. Other French teams fear that Monaco's billionaire Russian owner Dimitri Rybolovlev will embark on a spending spree similar to PSG's Qatari benefactors that will create a duopoly in the division.","Real Madrid's 1-1 draw at Espanyol gives Barcelona title with four games to play .

"AUSTIN, Texas (CNN) -- At dusk, stand on the Congress Avenue bridge over Town Lake, the span linking hip downtown to funkier South Austin, and you'll see it. Austin offers an array of choices for fitness and nightlife. No, not the 1.5 million Mexican free-tailed bats that emerge from crevasses below and fwip-fwip-fwip into the night (although they're pretty cool -- see them on the way to doing something else and it will be time well spent). What you'll see is Austin's diversity. And I don't mean yuppies, hippies, hipsters, scenesters, tech geeks, cowboys, students, musicians, politicians or got-more-money-than-sense rich folks, either -- though Austin has 'em all and more. Think Lance Armstrong. Think Willie Nelson. Day people. Night people. Cooling off after a run, perhaps. Or headed downtown. They come together here to witness the bats' spectacle. Live music capital of the world? Well, Austin at least has the clubs, dance halls, bar districts and late-night restaurants to keep a night person hopping. But Austin also caters to the early-to-bed, early-to-rise, run-six-miles-before-breakfast person. And, if you think you can, you can run all day and dance all night. Daylight's burning . A swath of wilderness: With no mountains, you wouldn't think Austin would be a destination for mountain bikers. Well, it's not Moab, Utah, but it's not bad. The highlight: The Barton Creek Greenbelt. This strip of green meanders from Zilker Park in the heart of Austin westward for 7.5 miles (with many side trails), ending at the Hill of Life -- a quarter-mile climb to test your thighs and lungs. The Greenbelt is popular with hikers and wanderers, so it's best not to crank with abandon, but the wooded straightaways and wet (sometimes) creek crossings make for an enjoyable ride. Can't bring your bike? Rent one at Bicycle Sport Shop, 517 S. Lamar Blvd. Ten miles downtown: The Town Lake Hike and Bike Trail runs 10.4 miles, mostly along the shores of the Colorado River on the southern border of downtown. There are walkers and easy-going cyclists, but this is also an excellent trail for running and getting a good look at Austin (as well as at other runners). The western half of the trail is alive with people (and an occasional celebrity), surrounded by trees. The eastern half involves crossing over Interstate 35, navigating some neighborhoods and a small stretch along city streets, but offers more solitude and wide-open trail. The soul of Austin: Barton Springs Pool (2101 Barton Springs Road) is three acres of old-school, spring-fed swimming. Open year-round, it's a jump-in-and-gasp 68 degrees no matter the weather. Nestled in a corner of Zilker Park, surrounded by pecan trees, the pool is often crowded (but seldom overwhelmed) on summer weekends and draws one of the most diverse crowds in Austin. Refueling stations . Enchiladas and margaritas: Matt's El Rancho (2613 S. Lamar Blvd.) is big, busy and well worth the wait. Since 1952 this hot spot has been Austin's self-proclaimed ""King of Mexican Food."" If they're not right about that, they're at least in the royal family. You can't get away without trying the Bob Armstrong dip -- think ""super-queso."" Dueling barbecue joints: Whatever you're looking for in Texas barbecue, you only have to choose between Stubb's Bar-B-Q (801 Red River St.) and Sam's Bar-B-Que (2000 E. 12th Street). Stubb's was once owned by the late patron saint of barbecue, C.B. Stubblefield. Sam's was a favorite of the late blues legend Stevie Ray Vaughan. Stubb's is a restaurant and live music venue. Sam's is a joint with uneven floors and character. Stubb's anchors its own entertainment mini-district. Sam's is definitely outside the tourist zone. Either way, you get a true barbecue experience. Nighttime is the right time . Bars, bars, bars: A river of alcohol runs along Austin's Sixth Street. The current is strongest in the entertainment district between Interstate 35 and Congress Avenue: A cluster of crowded nightspots ranging from the rarified air of the elite Driskill Hotel bar to the Chuggin' Monkey. Heading west, the river thins out and the scene grows up: There's Mother Egan's Irish Pub (715 W. Sixth), where the Dixie Chicks once ruled the Tuesday night trivia contest. And at the intersection with Lamar Boulevard, there's Whole Foods' flagship store -- where you can drink and shop at the same time. Live Music Capital of the World? You can't go anywhere here without seeing some fellow earnestly strumming a guitar. For the best chance at hearing something good, you want to head to a venue known for live music. The Continental Club (1315 S. Congress Ave.) is not just one of Austin's best, but also in the midst of the South Congress district of fashionable stores, oddball shops and restaurants (try the tacos al pastor at Guero's Taco Bar -- 1412 S. Congress Ave.) Honky-tonk heaven: It's a tech geek world, but the Broken Spoke (3201 S. Lamar Blvd.) is a refuge for those whose appreciation of cowboy boots and heartbroke country songs is irony-free. The Spoke is the real thing -- no urban cowboy stuff here. Populated by singers such as Dale Watson and Alvin Crow, serving up a mean chicken-fried steak and complete with its own museum of photos from better days, the Broken Spoke looks and feels ... just like it should.

"(CNN) -- Each spring, I monitor the list of commencement speakers at our nation's leading colleges and universities. Who is chosen, and who is not, tells us a lot about academia's perception of the most important voices in America. Two of this year's most popular speakers were CNN's Fareed Zakaria, who spoke at both Harvard University and Duke University, and EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson, who spoke at both Tulane University and the University of Washington. Perhaps one of the most original choices, and the one who certainly stood out from the rest, was U.S. Navy SEAL Eric Greitens, who addressed the 2012 graduating class of Tufts University Sunday. It's not often that elite universities honor military service members with commencement addresses. Gen. Dwight Eisenhower once spoke to a graduating class at an Ivy League university and remarked, ""Your business is to put me out of business."" So I applaud Tufts University for inviting Greitens. He is not a household name, but he should be. The 38-year-old Rhodes scholar and humanitarian worker turned U.S. Navy SEAL served multiple tours overseas fighting terrorist cells and received several military awards. Today, he is the CEO of the Mission Continues, a nonprofit foundation he created to help wounded and disabled veterans find ways to serve their communities at home. To the graduates of Tufts, Greitens issued a unique challenge, one rarely heard at commencements today: to sacrifice, to serve one's country and to live magnanimously. He called students to think above and beyond their own dreams, their own desires, and to be strong. Aristotle called this megalopsychia, greatness of soul, and considered it one of the greatest moral virtues. "" 'What kind of service can I provide? What kind of positive difference can I make in the lives of others?' If you work every day to live an answer to that question, then you will be stronger,"" Greitens declared. After dodging bullets, withstanding IED explosions and going days without sleep, Greitens realized the strength he needed to excel as a SEAL was found outside his own physical abilities. In his weakest moments, Greitens was able to find his greatest strength in service. ""The more I thought about myself, the weaker I became. The more I recognized that I was serving a purpose larger than myself, the stronger I became,"" he told the students at Tufts. He served his country and defended the weak against the rapacity of the wicked. Fifty years ago, Greitens' remarks would have been the norm. But through the years, the focus of education, particularly higher education, has shifted from selflessness to self-obsession. Many commencement speakers today tell students to ""Dream big"" and ""Do what you love."" It may be feel-good career advice, but it's incomplete life advice. Philosopher Martin Buber wrote, ""All education 'worthy' of the name is education of character."" Greitens gave the Tufts student an eloquent firsthand example. Greitens said it this way: ""The best definition I have ever heard of a vocation is that it's the place where your great joy meets the world's great need. ... We need all of you to find your vocation. To develop your joys, your passions, and to match them to the world's great needs."" Not all men are meant to be Navy SEALs, or even serve in the military, but all men can serve. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow recognized, ""The life of man consists not in seeing visions and in dreaming dreams but in active charity and in willing service."" We ask our students, what do you want to do when you grow up? Instead, we should ask them, whom or Whom, and what ideals do you want to serve when you grow up? That is a worthy thing to consider at graduation. Good for Greitens; good for Tufts. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William J. Bennett.","Former Navy SEAL Eric Greitens was commencement speaker at Tufts .

"REYKJAVIK, Iceland (CNN) -- Iceland may be best known for world-famous musical export Bjork but there's a new star quickly gaining this island nation worldwide acclaim -- clean energy. This hydrogen fuel cell car is leading an energy revolution in Iceland. For more than 50 years Iceland has been decreasing its dependence on fossil fuels by tapping the natural power all around this rainy, windswept rock of fire. Waterfalls, volcanoes, geysers and hot springs provide Icelanders with abundant electricity and hot water. Virtually all of the country's electricity and heating comes from domestic renewable energy sources -- hydroelectric power and geothermal springs. It's pollution-free and cheap. Yet these energy pioneers are still dependent on imported oil to operate their vehicles and thriving fishing industry. Iceland's geographic isolation in the North Atlantic makes it expensive to ship in gasoline -- it costs almost $8 a gallon (around $2 a liter). Iceland ranks 53rd in the world in greenhouse gas emissions per capita, according to the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center -- the primary climate-change data and information analysis center of the U.S. Department of Energy. Retired University of Iceland Professor Bragi Arnason has come up with a solution: Use hydrogen to power transportation. Hydrogen is produced with water and electricity, and Iceland has lots of both. ""Iceland is the ideal country to create the world's first hydrogen economy,"" Arnason explains. His big idea has earned him the nickname ""Professor Hydrogen."" Arnason has caught the attention of General Motors, Toyota and DaimlerChrysler, who are using the island-nation as a test market for their hydrogen fuel cell prototypes. One car getting put through its paces is the Mercedes Benz A-class F-cell -- an electric car powered by a DaimlerChrysler fuel cell. Fuel cells generate electricity by converting hydrogen and oxygen into water. And fuel cell technology is clean -- the only by-product is water.  Watch the F-cell navigate through Reykjavik » . ""It's just like a normal car,"" says Asdis Kritinsdottir, project manager for Reykjavik Energy. Except the only pollution coming out of the exhaust pipe is water vapor. It can go about 100 miles on a full tank. When it runs out of fuel the electric battery kicks in, giving the driver another 18 miles -- hopefully enough time to get to a refueling station. Filling the tank is similar to today's cars -- attach a hose to the car's fueling port, hit ""start"" on the pump and stand back. The process takes about five to six minutes.  See some of the F-cell's unique features » . In 2003, Reykjavik opened a hydrogen fueling station to test three hydrogen fuel cell buses. The station was integrated into an existing gasoline and diesel station. The hydrogen gas is produced by electrolysis -- sending a current through water to split it into hydrogen and oxygen. The public buses could run all day before needing refueling. The bus project lasted three years and cost around $10 million. The city will need five refueling stations in addition to the one the city already has to support its busy ring road, according to Arnason. The entire nation could get by on 15 refueling stations -- a minimum requirement. Within the year, 30-40 hydrogen fuel-cell cars will hit Reykjavik streets. Local energy company employees will do most of the test-driving but three cars will be made available to The Hertz Corp., giving Icelanders a chance to get behind the wheel.  Learn more about fuel cells » . ""I need a car,"" says Petra Svenisdottir, an intern at Reykjavik Energy. Svenisdottir, 28, commutes to work from her home in Hafnarfjorour to Reykjavik. The journey takes her about 15 minutes if she can beat traffic. ""If I didn't have a car I would have to take two or three buses and wait at each bus stop to arrive at work more than an hour later, cold and wet!"" Most Icelanders drive cars, says Arnason. Around 300,000 people live in a place about the size of the U.S. state of Kentucky. Transportation is limited to cars, buses and boats. ""Everyone has a car here,"" Arnason says. And it's very typical for an Icelandic family to own two cars. Arnason drives a small SUV. Fuel cell cars are expected to go on sale to the public in 2010. Carmakers have promised Arnason they will keep costs down and the government has said it will offer citizens tax breaks. He figures it will take an additional 4 percent of power to produce the hydrogen Iceland would need to meet its transportation requirements. Once Iceland's vehicles are converted over to hydrogen, the fishing fleet will follow. It won't be easy because of current technological limits and the high cost of storing large amounts of hydrogen, but Arnason feels confident it can happen. He predicts Iceland will be fossil fuel free by 2050. ""We are a very small country but we have all the same infrastructure of big nations,"" he said. ""We will be the prototype for the rest of the world."" E-mail to a friend .","Iceland turning to hydrogen to power its cars, buses and fishing fleet .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Seven Coptic Egyptians living abroad were sentenced to death Wednesday by a court in Cairo for their connection to an inflammatory anti-Islam film, the prosecutor's office said. The suspects are accused of being involved with the production of the film in California, said Adel Al Saeed, official spokesman for the prosecutor's office. Since the Egyptian citizens were tried in absentia, the sentence would be applied only if they returned to Egypt. Protests against the ""Innocence of Muslims"" film erupted in September in many Muslim countries, including Egypt, Yemen, Tunisia, Morocco, Sudan, Iran, Iraq, Israel and the Palestinian territories. Watch: Why the film upset so many Muslims . The amateurish film portrays the Prophet Mohammed as a womanizer, buffoon, ruthless killer and child molester. Islam categorically forbids any depictions of Mohammed, and blasphemy is an incendiary taboo in the Muslim world. Backed by hardcore anti-Islam groups in the United States, the film sparked outrage after an Arabic translation of the film's trailer was released online a few weeks before the anniversary of September 11. Opinion: We still need answers on Benghazi . In Cairo, some protesters scaled the wall of the U.S. Embassy and tore down its American flag, replacing it with a black flag adorned with an emblem used by Islamic radicals. Police and army personnel had to be deployed to prevent demonstrators from advancing on the compound. Actress sues filmmaker, YouTube in federal court . The film was also initially implicated in a violent demonstration in Libya that left the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans dead on September 11. Earlier this month, the Egyptian-American man behind the film was sentenced in California to one year in federal prison after admitting to violating the terms of his probation from a 2010 bank fraud case. The amateur filmmaker, Mark Basseley Youssef, also was ordered to serve four years of supervised release after his prison term. He was identified in initial news accounts in September as Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, the name used in the bank fraud case. Egyptian-American behind anti-Islam film denies violating probation .

"(CNN) -- Do you really turn off your smartphone, tablet or computer before takeoff and landing? Despite flight attendants telling passengers to power off, some people admit they don't always shut down their devices. Nearly one-third of passengers say they have accidentally forgotten to turn off their smartphones and other electronic devices in flight, according to this week's joint study by the Airline Passenger Experience Association and Consumer Electronics Association. While more than 90% agree those flight attendant directions to turn off devices are clear, 59% say they always turn their devices completely off and 21% say they switch their devices to ""airplane mode."" Some 5% say they sometimes completely shut down their devices. Many travelers also admit they don't actually understand when they can use those devices. More than 40% wrongly believe they can use devices while taxiing to the runway, more than 30% in the air before reaching 10,000 feet and 26% on a flight's final descent. Almost every adult passenger who travels with portable electronic devices carried at least one such device on board, and nearly two-thirds used them in flight, the study found. Debate continues over electronic gadgets on planes . ""Airline passengers have come to rely on their smartphones, tablets and e-readers as essential travel companions,"" said Doug Johnson, vice president of technology policy at the Consumer Electronics Association, in a statement. ""Understanding the attitudes and behaviors of passengers that are using electronic devices while traveling will help the FAA make informed decisions."" The study results were shared with the Federal Aviation Administration, according to an Airline Passenger Experience Association website posting. An FAA representative declined to comment on the study results. Hints of how the FAA might change the current rules regarding electronics in the air may come as soon as this summer. The FAA set up a working group in August to study the issue of portable electronics on flights and make suggestions for changes. ""The Aviation Rulemaking Committee continues to have regular meetings and teleconferences,"" said an FAA representative via e-mail. ""We expect their report and recommendations shortly after the group finishes its work at the end of July."" Both the FAA and Federal Communications Commission regulate electronics in the air. The FCC forbids the use of mobile phones using the 800 MHz frequency and other wireless devices on aircraft in flight because of ""potential interference to wireless networks on the ground."" The FAA supports that in-flight restriction but does allow the use of cell phones while the plane is on the ground, at the gate or waiting for a gate -- but not when the aircraft is taxiing for takeoff. The FAA bans the use of wireless devices during flight because of ""potential interference to the aircraft's navigation and communication systems."" The FAA allows use of some non-transmitting electronic devices outside of critical phases of flight such as takeoff and landing. During those noncritical phases of flight, the airlines set their own policies regarding passenger use of non-transmitting electronic devices.

""Grey's Anatomy"" creator Shonda Rhimes remembers crying in a Detroit hospital parking garage, overcome with emotion while waiting for her adopted daughter's birth. The book is also a family affair for Aronson. Her two adopted sons contribute their own recollections of how they became a family. Des Aronson, now almost 15 years old, shares an anecdote about getting lost soon after meeting his new mother when he was 5. Elevator doors closed unexpectedly at the Hilton Hotel in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, sending the new family into a panic across hotel floors. But ""Carried in Our Hearts"" is about more than the orphans who found their way to loving homes. It also includes a heart-wrenching reminder of the children left behind. The number of international adoptions has plummeted by more than 60% from its peak of 22,991 in 2004. More than 90% of Aronson's young patients were adopted internationally. In her work as a doctor, and as an advocate for children without families, she has witnessed brutal treatment of orphans in many parts of the world. She also knows the potential these children have to succeed, with education, attention and love. Internet reveals secrets of 'closed' adoptions . Aronson has made it her mission to improve the lives of the world's orphans, many of whom live in appalling conditions. Worldwide Orphans Foundation, the charity she founded in 1997, is dedicated to helping orphans around the world become productive members of their own communities. She recently talked to CNN about her new book, and her charity's work. The following is an edited transcript. CNN: What is the best way forward for solving the orphan crisis? Aronson: This is a huge problem. We have a population of 7 billion people in the world -- 2.2 billion of them are children. Probably half of those children are at risk for poverty, and lack of access to medical care, education and social support. Orphans, whether they be true orphans, double or single, or children living without parental care because they're children whose parents are unable to parent them -- children are at risk. The number from UNICEF that you see everywhere is 153 million children who are considered orphans, less than 18, loss of one or both parents. And that number is just horrific. The horror of it means that these are children at risk: for early marriage, living in the streets, prostitution, child labor, and finally -- the worst ever -- children who end up exploited by adults, and traded and trafficked. It is all about women and children. It's everything about women and children. It is so about women and children, I can't shout it enough. If young women are protected, and allowed the opportunities they deserve, then they would not be giving birth to babies that were not part of their family and their community. And they could go on and become stars and leaders. The book, from my point of view, is a tribute to all these families. We all did some great work together. We provided hundreds and thousands of children with homes. But it's a drop in the bucket. It's just an option. It's not the solution to a bigger problem. The highs and lows of foreign surrogacy . CNN: How did this book come about? Aronson: I built an international adoption consultation service. I ended up doing what I considered to be the best medicine I could have ever done. I was able to help people in a terribly vulnerable time in their lives. I successfully created families through adoption. I would shepherd them to help that child who was severely malnourished, depressed, delayed, and emotionally deprived become a really solid, juicy little butterball, happy -- it was really like being the stork. In the best of both worlds, it was the stork, not just the delivery of a baby in a hospital room, it was really the delivery of a baby by a collaboration, a team effort, by adoption service professionals, myself, the families. We were helping a little tiny child who had no potential become a person. I'm very proud of that work. I'm just so proud of that work. CNN: How did you get the families to share their stories? Aronson: I cast a wide net to get the stories. I sent out hundreds and hundreds of letters, maybe even a thousand. There were hundreds of people who wrote essays for me. I personally edited every story. The reason why I was so conscientious about editing each of the stories was because I wanted the stories to read universally. I wanted everyone to read this book to feel as if, 'You know, this is the story that resonates with me, that I can identify with,' because it's really about how parents are struggling to become parents, and children are struggling to become children. It was really great to write a book. I'm really proud to have written a book that really reflects a huge part of my life, and the lives of so many families. CNN: What made you decide to include stories from the perspective of children who were adopted? Aronson: That could be a whole book. That could be many books. But I really felt that there were so many families that I knew whose kids grew up during the time I was practicing, I felt it would be a sweet touch. And it was an opportunity for me to have my children express their thoughts about adoption, and they readily do that. CNN: What is the story behind the cover photo? Aronson: That's an extraordinary story. Here's this magnificent couple, attempting to adopt an Ethiopian baby, and they met with some challenges. They ended up with a very happy ending. That photo really reminds me of a house. The way in which they look at him from the side actually look like the sides of the roof, that scaffolds him and protects him. What's really interesting about that photo is how they really are looking at him, and themselves, and not at us. They are really showing, 'We love this baby. This baby is the center of our life. He's our heart. He's our home.'","""Carried in Our Hearts"" includes interviews with parents and children joined through adoption .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The United States is losing access to one of its three counternarcotics bases in Latin America, U.S. military officials said Wednesday. The Ecuadorian government has told the Bush administration it will not renew a 10-year agreement letting U.S. troops conduct anti-drug operations from Manta Air Base, an Ecuadorian Air Force installation, military officials said. The United States has used Manta Air Base since 1999 to run aerial surveillance of the eastern Pacific Ocean, looking for drug runners on the high seas as well as illicit flights. Ecuador notified the U.S. Embassy on Tuesday that it will not renew the agreement after it expires in November 2009, the U.S. military officials said. ""The Ecuadorian people do not want foreign troops on our soil, and the government has to follow the mandate of its people,"" Luis Gallegos, Ecuador's ambassador to the United States, said Wednesday. ""We have spent more than $150 million on troops to monitor the border with Colombia and will continue to support anti-narcotics operations in our country,"" Gallegos said. The U.S. State Department's reaction to the announcement was mixed. ""The operations there are critical to our overall counternarcotics strategy, but Ecuador has promised continued close cooperation to confront the threat of drug smuggling,"" said Heidi Bronke, a spokeswoman for the department. State Department chief spokesman Sean McCormack said the decision was Ecuador's to make. ""We note, however, that the closure will leave a serious gap in efforts by the United States and our partners to confront illegal drug trafficking throughout the region,"" he added. Up to eight planes fly missions from Manta. About 250 U.S. military personnel and civilians work there. Since the start of U.S. operations there, about 60 percent of the drug interdictions in the eastern Pacific have involved the planes based out of Manta, including the capture of more than 200 metric tons of drugs in 2007, according to U.S. military officials. State Department officials said they could not talk about plans to move the mission to another country. Manta is the only U.S. base in South America. The U.S. military operates two other counternarcotics bases in the region: a naval operation in El Salvador and an air operation in Curacao in the Caribbean.","Deal that expires next year lets U.S. conduct anti-drug operations from Ecuador .

"(CNN) -- Politics can be a blood-soaked affair in Pakistan, and this leadership struggle is no exception. Dozens have been killed in attacks in the weeks leading up to this Saturday's election. And yet, this poll is expected to mark a milestone in Pakistan's 66-year history: The first democratic transition of power. The nation has experienced three military coups, been ruled by generals for half its life, and it remains mired in near-constant political turmoil. But the former government defied expectations by becoming the first elected to serve a full five-year term. ""Despite all the odds, completion of the term is an extraordinary and historic achievement,"" Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf said in an address to the nation on March 16, marking the end of the term and the start of the election season now coming to an end. The government may have survived, but the country has lurched from crisis to crisis. Here are some of the main developments from the last five years of political turmoil. 2008 . The nation collectively mourns the death of PPP leader Benazir Bhutto, who is assassinated just months before the elections in February 2008. The Pakistan Peoples Party -- led by Bhutto's widower, Asif Ali Zardari -- comes to power on the back of a populace disillusioned with then-President Perez Musharraf. He leads a coalition with Nawaz Sharif's Muslim League party, however the alliance collapses when Sharif pulls out after failed efforts to secure the release of dozens of judges put under house arrest by President Musharraf during a state of emergency in 2007. In August of the same year, Musharraf resigns as president, clearing the way for Zardari to take over the post. 2011 . On May 2, U.S. President Barack Obama announces the killing of Osama Bin Laden, who was living in hiding at a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. The incident underlines the often fractious relationship Washington has with Islamabad, whose leaders had long said Bin Laden was not hiding in Pakistan. Pakistan's parliament adopts a resolution condemning the U.S. raid and Musharraf brands it a ""act of war."" In October, Pakistani businessman Mansoor Ijaz claims in an op-ed piece for the UK-based Financial Times that a Pakistani diplomat had him deliver a secret memo to U.S. Admiral Mike Mullen, who was then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The memo, allegedly from Zardari, reportedly asked the U.S. to back him in the event of a military coup related to the U.S. killing of Osama bin Laden. The government said it had nothing to do with the memo. In December, Pakistan's Supreme Court appoints a panel to investigate the memo. 2012 . In February, Yousuf Raza Gilani becomes the first Pakistani prime minister to be charged while in office. He's accused of contempt for refusing to re-open old corruption cases against Zardari. Two months later, Gilani is convicted and receives a symbolic sentence of custody for the duration of the hearing. He refuses to resign and vows to appeal. In June, Pakistan's Supreme Court rules that Gilani is ineligible to hold office. The court declares the prime minister disqualified retroactive to April 26. Raja Pervez Ashraf is appointed prime minister after majority vote in parliament. Later in the year, the Pakistani Taliban claims responsibility for a series of attacks on Shiite Muslims. In the months ahead, militants stage further attacks against Shiites in an attempt to disrupt the election. 2013 . In January, the Supreme Court orders the arrest of Ashraf over corruption allegations which one of his advisers calls a ""soft coup"" against democracy. Ashraf denies the claims. In March, a caretaker government is appointed to oversee parliamentary elections. March 24 -- Musharraf lands in Karachi after more than four years in exile. He faces criminal charges, and the Taliban vow to unleash a ""death squad"" to assassinate him. He returns to face a lengthy list of charges, including accusations he illegally deposed and detained 62 senior judges during a period of emergency rule in 2007, and not doing enough to protect the life of Bhutto, the country's first woman to be elected prime minister of Pakistan. He denies any wrongdoing. April 11 -- A candidate in May's 2013 national elections in Pakistan is shot and killed by two gunmen on a motorbike. Candidate Fakhar Ul Islam was targeted on his way home from his office, police said. Islam was a member of Muttahida Quami Movement or MQM, Pakistan's most liberal and secular political party. April 12 --  Musharraf acknowledges his government secretly signed off on U.S. drone strikes, the first time a top past or present Pakistani official has admitted publicly to such a deal. His admission to CNN runs counter to their repeated denunciations of a program they long claimed the United States was operating without their approval. READ MORE: Ex-Pakistani President Musharraf admits secret deal with U.S. on drone strikes . April 16 -- At least 15 people in Peshawar are killed and 35 people injured in a suicide bombing targeting an anti-Taliban political party, hospital and police officials said. A bomber blows himself up when Ghulam Ahmed Bilour, senior vice president of the Awami National Party, gets out of a car. Bilour's driver and two police officials were killed. Meanwhile, Musharraf's comeback hits the skids when election officials bar him from running for a parliamentary seat. He had been disqualified because he declared a state of emergency in 2007. Even though he hasn't been tried for that action, the move has been ruled an act of treason, making him ineligible to run for office. April 26 -- An explosion in Karachi, Pakistan, kills at least eight people and injured more than 20, Karachi authorities said. The target of the blast was a meeting the Awami National Party, an anti-Taliban liberal political party. April 28 -- Five people die and 22 are wounded by an explosion in Orakzai, police said. In Peshawar, three people are killed and eight wounded, police said. Both attacks target independent candidates. April 29 -- A man on a motorcycle detonates explosives near a police van in northwest Pakistan, killing at least six people and wounding more than 30, police said. The explosion took place on a busy road in the city of Peshawar. April 30 -- Gunmen kill a political candidate and three other people. During the attack in Balochistan province, men fire on a vehicle carrying Fateh Muhammad Magsi, an independent candidate, police said. A court in Pakistan bans Musharraf from politics for life. The move -- which can be appealed -- is another barrier in the road Musharraf faces as he tries to get back into his country's political mix. May 3 -- Gunmen in Pakistan kill a leading prosecutor working on high-profile terrorism cases and an anti-Taliban politician and his son. Chaudhry Zulfiqar Ali was heading to a court in Rawalpindi, where he was trying a case stemming from the death of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who was assassinated while she was campaigning for her party in 2007. In Karachi, gunmen on a motorbike shoot and kill Sadiq Zaman Khattak and his 4-year-old son as they leave a mosque, said Zahid Khan of Awami National Party, an anti-Taliban liberal party. May 5 --  Three people are killed and more than 30 injured in back-to-back explosions near the headquarters of an anti-Taliban political party in Karachi. The explosions, about 30 minutes apart, take place near the headquarters of Muttahida Quami Movement. One device is placed in a rickshaw, police said. The second is buried in the ground. May 7 -- A blast near a political rally leaves 18 people dead in a Pakistan tribal region, a local government official said. The explosion occurs during a rally staged by the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazal Ur Rehman group, a right-wing religious party with sympathies for the militant Taliban movement. In Lahore, former cricket star Imran Khan, running for prime minister, was injured when he fell off a stage during a political rally for Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party - throwing even more uncertainty into Saturday's race. He continues to campaign from his hospital bed as doctors say he's expected to make a full recovery. At least 16 people are killed in two attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province; one attack targeted a Pakistan People's Party rally, and the other targeted a candidate for the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazal Ur Rehman group, police said. May 9 -- Ali Haider Gilani -- son of former Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani -- is kidnapped on his way to address a public meeting in the city of Multan. His younger brother is running for a seat in the Punjab provincial assembly. CNN's Nasir Habib, Saima Moshin, Nic Robertson, Saeed Ahmed, Jethro Mullen, Shaan Khan and the CNN Wire Staff contributed to this report.","Pakistan is poised for its first democratic transition of power in its 66-year history .

"KAMPALA, Uganda (CNN) -- At least 640 people were arrested and 14 killed in fighting in Uganda's capital between government forces and loyalists of a traditional kingdom, police said Sunday. A man tries to put out a fire on Friday in Kasubi, Uganda, a suburb of Kampala. The number of people arrested for suspected roles in the three-day riots could go up because investigations are still under way, said Kale Kayihura, the nation's police chief. Trials for the suspects will start Monday on charges including taking part in violent acts and unlawful assemblies, Kayihura said. At least 82 were injured, according to the police chief. Tensions between President Yoweri Museveni and the Buganda kingdom -- headed by King Ronald Mutebi II, the ruler of the Baganda tribe -- have intensified in recent years. The violence flared Thursday when the government said it would not allow the king to travel to an area inhabited by a renegade rival group. After the travel ban, young Bagandans took to the streets, stealing ammunition from a police station and confronting officers, accusing them of harassment. ""The government is wrong to undermine cultural institutions which are the backbone of Uganda's heritage,"" said Mzamiru Balidha, a resident of Kampala. ""Cultural leaders must be left alone since they are not interfering in politics."" Rioters burned tires and cars, set buildings on fire and looted stores. Streets in the capital were strewn with debris over the weekend, including torched cars and burned tires. Police and the army patrolled deserted but calm streets Sunday as residents tried to return to normalcy after the protests. ""I'm happy to see that there is peace now,"" said Harry Sagara of Kampala. ""Now people can return to work."" Government officials and the Buganda kingdom have been at odds for years, sparring over land, sovereignty and political power. A government official said Sunday that the two leaders have pledged to meet and address their differences. ""Both the central government and the king are still working out details of the meeting,"" said Daudi Migereko, the minister of parliamentary affairs. Bagandans are the dominant ethnic group and one of four ancient kingdoms in the nation. Kings in the east African nation are limited to a ceremonial role overseeing traditional and cultural affairs. Journalist Samson Ntale contributed to this report.","At least 640 arrested, police say; number could rise; trials to begin Monday .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Hussein Shafei prepared Saturday for a journey back to a place of darkness in Libya. Soon, he plans to stand again in Cell 14, Block 2 at the Abu Salim prison in Tripoli. Only this time, the metal door will not slam behind him, caging him in a bathroom-size cell. He will be a free man within the confines of what became a potent symbol of Moammar Gadhafi's repression -- Libya's Abu Ghraib. Shafei wants to return to the place where he witnessed a massacre that fuels his nightmares. Sometimes, he said, his wife would wake him up in the middle of the night, saying, ""Hussein. You are screaming. You are scaring the kids."" As many as 1,200 prisoners were killed at Abu Salim in the summer of 1996, according to Human Rights Watch. Without justice, the infamous event festered in Libya's national psyche and eventually acted as tinder to spark the flame of revolt in February of this year. Rebels stormed the prison a few days ago, freeing those held inside, including an American journalist. ""I am so excited about Tripoli,"" Shafei said of the distinct possibility of the capital falling under rebel control. ""This is the moment I have been waiting for for so many years."" Since his release in 2000, Shafei had thought about Abu Salim's dead. Where were their bodies? What was it like for their children to grow up without their fathers? For a wife to not know what happened to her husband? He vowed to expose the carnage of that June day. Then this week in Benghazi, he watched a video posted on YouTube that purportedly showed the storming of Abu Salim. Shafei, now working with the opposition in Benghazi, knew he had to return there. He was waiting to board a plane to Tripoli. Or perhaps, with the fighting still raging in places like Gadhafi's hometown of Sirte, he will have to go by boat. With the Libyan regime on the brink of collapse, Shafei hopes the truth about Abu Salim will finally be known. He is hardly alone in his wish. The shooting went on for almost three hours . Shafei was a teenage college student when he was arrested for offending the regime. Inspired by perestroika reforms in the Soviet Union in the late 1980s, he spoke out in favor of greater freedoms in his own country. Shafei's mother, Najia, clearly remembers that day in 1988 when she returned to her home in Benghazi to find her daughters wailing. Her son was gone. ""We had no idea where he was,"" she said from her home in Atlanta. ""Whether he was alive or dead."" Nineteen months passed before Najia Shafei learned, through contacts, her son's whereabouts. After that, she occasionally made the long trek west from Benghazi to the prison in Tripoli. The guards would drag her son out of his cell and into a warehouse at the entrance of the jail, where mother and son met. If she was lucky, she got 20 minutes with him, she said. She could never ask him about his situation. There were always guards listening in. He could never tell her about what he knew was going on in that jail -- beatings, torture, deaths. Shafei spent eight years that way, in a cramped cell, without his family or the education he should have finished. His father died in 1994 and he was released for three days to attend the funeral. That was the extent of his freedom. Then, on June 28, 1996, prisoners rioting over poor conditions and restricted family visits seized a guard and escaped from their cells. ""Five or seven minutes after it started, the guards on the roofs shot at the prisoners who were in the open areas,"" Shafei said in an interview with Human Rights Watch many years later. Security officials ordered the shooting to stop and feigned negotiations. But Shafei told Human Rights Watch that the officials instead called in firing squads to gun down about 1,200 people. He said a grenade was thrown into the courtyards where the prisoners were gathered. ""I heard an explosion, and right after, a constant shooting started from heavy weapons and Kalashnikovs from the top of the roofs,"" he said. ""The shooting continued from 11 until 1:35."" Much later, while buying lamb at a slaughterhouse in the United States, Shafei commented to his brother Nabil: Not even here can they kill at the rate Gadhafi's men did that day. ""I could not see the dead prisoners who were shot, but I could see those who were shooting,"" Shafei told Human Rights Watch. ""They were a special unit and wearing khaki military hats. Six were using Kalashnikovs. I saw them -- at least six men -- on the roofs of the cellblocks."" The next day, Shafei was ordered to clean the blood-smeared watches taken off the wrists of the dead. Human Rights Watch said it had no way to verify Shafei's story but another description of the incident from a report by the opposition National Front for the Salvation of Libya corroborated Shafei's account. Gadhafi's government did not acknowledge the killings and denied any crime had taken place. More than a decade after the Abu Salim incident, the United Nations Human Rights Council noted that the Libyan government was unable to provide any information on its investigation of the allegations. But the families, mostly from Benghazi, now the de facto rebel capital, did not abandon their longing for answers. Some of them filed a complaint in a Libyan court in 2007. The Gadhafi regime offered them compensation in exchange for their silence, according to Human Rights Watch. But the families refused the money, considering it a bribe. Instead, they boldly began to protest each Saturday in Benghazi, an action unprecedented in Gadhafi's four decades of rule. ""It was radical,"" said Sarah Leah Whitson, director of the Middle East and Africa division at Human Rights Watch. The government began informing some of the families that their loved ones were dead. But no bodies was ever returned nor a cause of death given. Among those waiting to find out more are three brothers in Atlanta whose father, opposition activist Izzat Almegaryaf, was plucked from his home 20 years ago. The Almegaryaf brothers know their father was detained at Abu Salim -- they received letters from him in the early 1990s. But the letters stopped a few years into Izzat Almegaryaf's imprisonment. His sons do not know whether their father was among the massacre victims. Tasbeeh Herwees, a Libyan-American journalism student in California, recalled in a blog post the funerals for the Abu Salim victims held in the summer of 2009 when she visited Benghazi. ""Inna lillahi wa ilayhi rajioon,"" each family said. Verily, we belong to God, and to God we return. Herwees tripped over the words in Arabic, but by the end of her stay she had repeated the phrase so many times that she was fluent. ""I spent more time in tents that summer than in my own home, the cloth of my black abaya sticking irritatingly to my skin from the Saharan humidity,"" she wrote. ""In the faces of the family of the dead, I detected relief in the sea of sadness. 'At least now we know,' they said."" Then in February of this year, the regime arrested Fathi Terbil, a human rights lawyer who represented some of the Abu Salim families. Hundreds of people jammed the streets of Benghazi to protest. Terbil was released but the demonstrations did not stop. A revolution took root. ""The memories of that summer come rushing back as I watch the present events in Libya unfold from my home in Cypress, California,"" Herwees wrote. ""It was, after all, the Abu Salim families who kick-started this revolution. It was they who initiated protests in Benghazi in front of police headquarters when their lawyer, Fathi Terbil, was mysteriously detained by security officials."" Exposing the carnage . After 12 years at Abu Salim, Shafei was released in 2000. He often cried openly, with flashbacks triggered by something as small as macaroni reminiscent of Abu Salim chow, said his older brother, Nabil Shafei. He eventually made his way to the United States, where Nabil lived. ""Hussein came here and had a mission,"" Nabil Shafei said. ""He wanted to expose the massacre of Abu Salim."" Hussein Shafei told Human Rights Watch about the carnage he witnessed. He even approached the State Department, which includes the Abu Salim massacre in its statements on human rights abuses in Libya. As the civil war raged this year and Benghazi blossomed as a city free of Gadhafi's grip, Shafei, now 42, returned there from Charlotte, North Carolina. He took his wife and three children with him. He has been working with the opposition television station and telling the world about the dark secrets of Abu Salim. Now, as the newly freed prisoners began returning home to Benghazi, Shafei knew the time had come for him to go back to the prison. It is part of his own healing. The nation must heal, too, he believes. The first step will be to hold Libyan leaders accountable for what happened at the prison. Najia Shafei is wary of her son's trip to Tripoli. She remains fearful about what might happen to him as long as Gadhafi is still alive. But Hussein Shafei is determined to complete his mission. He owes it to all those who survived Abu Salim. But mostly, he owes it to the souls of the dead.","Hussein Shafei says he witnessed the 1996 killings of 1,200 prisoners at Abu Salim .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Two people were killed and at least 15 injured Saturday in Cairo, officials said, as Egyptians in two rival cities took to the streets to vent their anger over court verdicts in a controversial case involving deadly riots at a soccer game. Health Ministry spokesman Ahmed Osman said two protesters had been killed in violence outside the Semiramis Intercontinental hotel in downtown Cairo. Five others have been injured in the clashes by the hotel, he said. Another 10 are suffering smoke inhalation after a fire gutted the three-story building housing the Egyptian Football Association in a wealthy Cairo neighborhood, as soccer fans looked on. Next door, an exclusive club for policemen was also ablaze. In Port Said, the other city with a stake in the court case, small fires burned in the harbor. The military has been deployed in the volatile northeastern city to try to avoid a repeat of past violent protests. Saturday's disorder erupted after a Cairo court confirmed death sentences previously handed down to 21 defendants in the Port Said soccer riot case and sentenced more than 20 others to prison terms, state media said. The rampage in February 2012 left 74 people dead and 1,000 injured, after the Port Said home team, al-Masry soccer club, defeated visiting Cairo team al-Ahly. A majority of the victims in the stadium rampage -- where fans went at each other with rocks, chairs, knives and swords -- were Cairo fans. Of those sentenced to prison, five people received life sentences and 10 others were given 15 years in prison, the state-run EgyNews agency reported. Among those given a 15-year term were the leading policeman on trial, General Essam Samak, former chief of security in Port Said, and a second police official, Mohamed Saad, state media said. Seven other policemen were acquitted. Other prison sentences were lesser, and the court cleared 28 people in total in the case, EgyNews said. Lawyers for the 73 defendants, who also included al-Masry club staff, can file an appeal. There was some initial confusion in Egyptian media over the final verdicts. The sentences have prompted anger in both cities, with some protesters in Port Said believing they are too harsh and others in Cairo convinced they do not go far enough. Hardcore fans . A statement on the Ahly club's official website backed the Cairo court but said the fight for justice wasn't over. ""The court's verdict was fair for fans of the Ahly team. We support the prosecutor general's decision to appeal the 28 acquittals and we'll continue supporting the families of the Port Said football victims,"" it said. ""We will not give up until justice is served to all their sons."" But the lighter punishment for policemen accused of standing by amid the stadium violence angered some. Eyewitnesses at the Egyptian Football Association headquarters told CNN that Ultra Ahly fans outraged by the verdicts set the building ablaze as they marched towards Tahrir Square, the usual focal point for demonstrations in the capital. The Ultras are hardcore soccer fans who have also become involved in political protests. Earlier, around 1,000 Ahly supporters who were at the Cairo soccer club erupted in cheers and set off fireworks to celebrate, as the judges, sitting in the police academy in New Cairo, a suburb of the capital, gave their ruling. Old resentments . In Port Said, near the Sinai Peninsula, black smoke rose into the sky as tires fixed to docks went up in flames. The tires serve as rubber bumpers to prevent damage to ships knocking against the piers. Without them, anchoring in port is more difficult. Port Said demonstrators also protested against the nation's government and President Mohamed Morsy. Some complained that justice for Port Said was sacrificed to placate Cairo. Their anger reflects a deeper resentment of the capital common in the port city. Many Port Said residents believe that too much of the tax money collected from ships passing through the port lands in Cairo, which does not return enough of the funds to their municipal coffers. Port Said has been shaken by violent protests in recent days as the date for the verdict neared. Deadly clashes erupted after the 21 death sentences were first handed down in January. Port Said's tense relationship with Cairo dates back about 60 years. Many residents of Port Said felt Egyptian security forces didn't adequately defend the city during the series of wars with Israel that began with the Jewish state's creation in 1948 and ended after the 1973 Arab-Israeli War. Journalists Ian Lee and Adam Makary reported from Cairo, Nada Wassef from Port Said and CNN's Salma Abdelaziz from Atlanta. Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London, and Ben Brumfield wrote in Atlanta.","NEW: Official: 2 people killed, 15 injured in Cairo amid clashes sparked by court verdicts .

"(CNN) -- As Congress debates immigration law, it cannot avoid debating citizenship. Who gets to be a citizen? And what should citizens know, believe, and do? Under current law, would-be citizens must pass the U.S. Naturalization Test, which poses factual questions about civics and history such as: ""What are two rights in the Declaration of Independence?"" They must respond with two of the following: life, liberty, or the pursuit of happiness. This test assumes that a competent citizen knows some basic information about the U.S. political system. Most American students must demonstrate similar competence. All U.S. states have standards for K-12 social studies and, typically, the teacher assesses knowledge with paper-and-pencil tests that resemble the naturalization test. One question is whether these requirements reflect a worthy definition of citizenship. Should we insist on knowing generalized facts but not, for example, skills for working with other people, or values such as a commitment to other people's rights? Another question is whether studying for short-answer tests teaches people much. Someone could study for the naturalization test by memorizing phrases without understanding at all what they mean. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services provides online flashcards to help, and the same is true of multiple choice civics tests in high school. We could ask similar questions about the Pledge of Allegiance. When schools drop the pledge, it's interpreted as an attack on patriotic values. But if there were no pledge, would we really choose to instill patriotism and knowledge of the U.S. system by requiring students to repeat the same 31 words daily from kindergarten through senior year? Would we be satisfied if millions of elementary school students said ""indivisible"" every day, but hardly any of them knew what it meant? If it is a pledge, why would we ask them to repeat it daily? Surely a promise is for keeps. In other words, we should be thinking about what we want citizens to know, believe and do and how to teach and promote those objectives. The bipartisan ""Gang of 8"" senators introduced an act recently, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Act, that takes a promising new approach. It doesn't mention the naturalization test at all. Instead, it would create a new U.S. citizenship foundation that would promote civic education for immigrants, especially low-income residents. Those who seek ""merit-based"" naturalization -- jumping ahead of the queue -- would get points for ""civic involvement"" if they had engaged in a significant amount of community service. The law values an understanding of constitutional principles, but it adds community service as an element of citizenship, and it encourages better teaching approaches than using flashcards to study for a short test. It doesn't specify those approaches but asks the foundation to look for ""best practices."" If the new foundation becomes a reality, members should keep three principles in mind. First, the goal should be to encourage people who are seeking naturalization to be genuinely constructive contributors to civic life. Memorizing a few phrases won't suffice to show they are capable citizens, but having the opportunity to learn advanced civic skills will help them and their communities. Our research finds that people who are engaged with their communities tend to fare much better in school, jobs and life. Second, although being a good citizen means supporting certain core principles, civic education should not be fully standardized. One size does not fit all. A grandmother who has fled tyranny does not need the same kind of civic education as an adolescent who was born in the United States and knows only this country and the English language. Third, an immigrant background is a civic asset. Newcomers contribute valuable knowledge and insights from their home countries. Most research on young immigrants finds that they flourish and contribute best if they hold on to aspects of their parents' cultures. When they lose their background culture, the worst elements of U.S. culture, such as fast food and violence, tend to affect them most strongly. As Congress debates the immigration bill, the nation's attention will be focused on the question of who should be a citizen. We should not forget the equally important question of what citizens must know, believe, and do. For immigrants and native-born Americans alike, civic education should not be about passing a simple test but promoting high and diverse civic achievement. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peter Levine.","Peter Levine: Would-be citizens must pass U.S. Naturalization Test, like a high school test .

"(CNN) -- Since the bombing of the Boston marathon -- in which three people, including a child, were killed and more than 200 injured -- attention has naturally focused on what could have been done to prevent it. Some, such as Rep. Peter King, the New York Republican who chairs the Homeland Security Committee, have argued for increased surveillance of Muslims in the United States. Local police departments ""have to realize that the threat is coming from the Muslim community and increase surveillance there,"" he says. Others have asked whether leads were properly followed and if better sharing of information between agencies would have helped thwart the bombing. However, the government, with its $40 billion annual intelligence budget, already amasses vast quantities of information on the private lives of Muslims in the United States. The FBI has 3,000 intelligence analysts working on counterterrorism and 15,000 paid informants, according to Mother Jones. Exactly how many of them are focused on Muslims in the United States is unknown; there is little transparency in this area. But, given the emphasis the FBI has placed on preventing Muslim terrorism, and based on my interviews with FBI agents working on counterterrorism, there could be as many as two-thirds assigned to spying on Muslims. Taking the usual estimate of the Muslim population in the United States of 2.35 million, this would mean the FBI has a spy for every 200 Muslims in the United States. When one adds the resources of the National Security Agency, regional intelligence fusion centers, and the counterterrorism work of local police departments, such as the New York Police Department (where a thousand officers are said to work on counterterrorism and intelligence), the number of spies per Muslim may increase dramatically. East Germany's communist-era secret police, the Stasi, had one intelligence analyst or informant for every 66 citizens. This suggests that Muslims in the United States could be approaching levels of state surveillance similar to that which the East German population faced from the Stasi. Yet, as the Stasi itself eventually discovered, no system of surveillance can ever produce total knowledge of a population. Indeed, the greater the amount of information collected, the harder it is to interpret its meaning. In the majority of terrorist attacks in recent years, the relevant information was somewhere in the government's systems, but its significance was lost amid a morass of useless data. What is obscured by the demands for ever greater surveillance and information processing is that security is best established through relationships of trust and inclusion  within the community. The real missed opportunity to intervene before the bombs went off in Boston likely came three months earlier, when bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev stood up during a Friday prayer service at his mosque - the Islamic Society of Boston, in Cambridge - to angrily protest the imam's sermon. The imam had been celebrating the life of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., which Tsarnaev thought was selling out. According to one report, Tsarnaev was then kicked out of the prayer service for his outburst. Since 9/11, mosque leaders have been under pressure to eject anyone expressing radical views, rather than engaging with them and seeking to challenge their religious interpretation, address their political frustrations, or meet their emotional needs. That policy has been forced on mosques by the wider climate of excessive surveillance, which means mosques are wary of even having conversations with those perceived to be radicals, for fear of attracting official attention. The fear is that every mosque has a government informant listening for radical talk. Unsurprisingly, this means most people are reluctant to engage with young people expressing radical views, who instead tend to be ejected from the congregation. The Tsarnaev brothers were said to be angry about U.S. foreign policy in Afghanistan and Iraq, possibly drawing parallels with their own experiences as refugees from Russia's brutal wars of counterinsurgency in the Caucasus. But because discussions of foreign policy have been off-limits in mosques since 9/11, they were unlikely to have had their anger acknowledged, engaged, challenged or channeled into nonviolent political activism. The heavy surveillance of Muslims has meant there is no room for mosques to engage with someone like Tamerlan Tsarnaev, listen to him, challenge those of his ideas that might be violent, or offer him emotional support. Instead, Muslims have felt pressured to demonstrate their loyalty to America by steering clear of dissident conversations on foreign policy. Flawed models of the so-called ""radicalization"" process have assumed that the best way to stop terrorist violence is to prevent radical ideas from circulating. Yet the history of terrorism suggests the opposite is true. Time and again, support for terrorism appears to increase when legitimate political activism is suppressed - from the French anarchists who began bombing campaigns after the defeat of the Paris Commune, to the Algerian National Liberation Front struggling to end French colonialism, to the Weather Underground's ""Declaration of a state of war"" after state repression of student campaigns against the Vietnam War. Reconstructing the motivation for the bombings is fraught with difficulty; there can be little certainty in such matters. But pathological outcomes are more likely when space for the free exchange of feelings and opinions is squeezed. As many community activists and religious leaders argued in Britain in the aftermath of the 7/7 terrorist attacks on the London transport system in 2005, the best preventive measure is to enable anger, frustration and dissent to be expressed as openly as possible, rather than driving them underground where they more easily mutate into violent forms. These activists put this approach into practice, for example at the Brixton mosque in south London, by developing initiatives in the community to engage young people in discussions of foreign policy, identity and the meaning of religious terms like jihad, in order to counter those who advocate violence against fellow citizens. It is difficult to measure the success of such programs. But many see them as having played an important role in undermining support for terrorism. In what must seem a paradox to backers of East German levels of surveillance like Peter King, more radical talk might be the best way of reducing terrorist violence. No one could have predicted from Tsarnaev's outburst that, a few months later, he would be suspected of carrying out an act of mass murder on the streets of Boston. And we don't know what would have made a difference in the end. But a community able to express itself openly without fear, whether in the mosque or elsewhere, should be a key element in the United States' efforts to prevent domestic terrorism. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Arun Kundnani.","Debate has ranged widely over how to prevent terrorist attacks .

"(CNN) -- As Europe and the International Monetary Fund hammer out the the final details of an Irish rescue package worth tens of billions, the British government Monday offered a direct loan to Ireland worth $11.3 billion (£7 billion). The British Finance Minister George Osborne said the offer of the loan was in Britain's national interest and that Ireland was a ""friend in need."" Osborne said that in addition to the offer, Britain would also be contributing to an international rescue package, adding that details of the British, IMF and Eurozone packages were still being worked out. ""Ireland is our very closest economic neighbor so I judged it to be in our national interest to be part of the international efforts to help the Irish,"" Osborne told the BBC. Asked if the British commitment totaled $11.3 billion, Mr Osborne said: ""It's around that, it's in the billions not the tens of billions."" What does the bailout mean? On Sunday Ireland formally requested substantial ""financial assistance"" from the European Union and IMF, Prime Minister Brian Cowen said. ""I want to assure the Irish people that we have a better future before us,"" Cowen said in announcing the request, as well as pledging substantial budget cuts and tax hikes. Ireland needs funds to shore up its struggling banking sector and buttress the government, which has poured billions into saving the banks. Fears about Ireland have pushed down the value of the euro against the dollar and put stock markets under pressure. But the request for help is unpopular in Ireland, and the government could be punished Thursday when there is an election to fill an empty seat in parliament. A small crowd of protesters demonstrated Sunday night, as government ministers left the press conference where the aid request was announced. One person was arrested earlier in the day for public order offenses at a demonstration outside government offices, police said. But European Union finance ministers welcomed Ireland's request for assistance, according to a joint statement issued soon after Cowen's announcement. The ministers agreed earlier on Sunday to take on the request and start negotiations, Irish Finance Minister Brian Lenihan said. ""Ministers concur with the [European] Commission and the European Central Bank that providing assistance to Ireland is warranted to safeguard financial ability in the EU and in the euro area,"" the EU statement said. The central bank's governing council likewise embraced the request, saying in a statement that a loan deal ""will contribute to ensuring the stability of the Irish banking system and permit it to perform its role in the functioning of the economy."" The IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn said, in a news release, that the international finance institution ""stands ready to join this effort, including through a multi-year loan."" Dublin had long publicly insisted it would not seek an external bailout, despite widespread concerns that a ballooning budget deficit and wobbly banking sector would further cripple the Irish economy. Yet a possible loan package was front-and-center during talks this week of European financial ministers. And officials from the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF have been meeting officials from Ireland's Department of Finance and the National Treasury Management Agency since Thursday, hashing out measures required to bring stability to the Irish banking system. Those negotiations now continue to determine the extent and guidelines for any aid package, according to Cowen, who said he expects a deal to be finalized ""in the next few weeks."" At Sunday night's press conference in Dublin, which followed a meeting of Cowen's cabinet, Lenihan said the country would ask for less than 100 billion euros from the EU and the IMF. Last May, those two bodies bailed Greece out to the tune of 110 billion euros (currently $150 billion). Cowen said that the government planned to cut 6 billion euros before it wraps its current budgetary cycle on December 7 and planned to eliminate a total of 15 billion euros over the next four years. ""These targets already have the support of European [financial] ministers,"" the prime minister said. ""These [cuts] will be difficult for everyone."" In part to meet its loan requirements, Dublin also will set out a comprehensive four-year plan detailing its deficit-reduction and other measures to shore up the Irish economy, according to Cowen. He said that while corporate tax rates would stay unchanged, income tax levels would rise to 2006 levels. In addition, Cowen said he'd push new policies that would make Irish banks ""significantly smaller than they have been in the past ... so they can be brought on their feet."" Ireland shares the euro with 15 other European nations, and its perilous financial situations has raised concerns about a trickle-down effect on the common currency and the wider European Union. Responding to questions that a large outside loan might threaten Ireland's sovereignty, Cowen said Ireland's economy was already tightly tied into Europe's and said ""support ... from our partners"" encouraged him to support asking for their assistance. ""Our membership in the EU has transformed our country for the better,"" the prime minister said. ""[But] the task of rebuilding our economy falls to our own ... people."" Journalist Peter Taggart and CNN's Jim Boulden and Bharati Naik contributed to this report.","NEW: British government offers Ireland $11 billion loan offer .

"Frederick, Maryland (CNN) -- Nearly two years after arriving in America with the promise of a new nose and ears, Aesha Mohammadzai has finally begun the process of reconstructive surgery. The young Afghan woman, whose face was mutilated by her Taliban husband and in-laws, checked into Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, early Thursday morning. After nearly six hours, the first of about six anticipated surgeries -- which will be performed over the course of up to two years -- is now complete, said Mati Arsala, who along with his wife has been caring for Aesha. ""I woke her up at 5 a.m.,"" he said Thursday night, recounting how the day began. ""She said, 'Momo Mati' -- that's what she calls me, Uncle Mati -- 'let me sleep.' I said, 'You have an operation today,' and she jumped. As soon as I said that, she jumped! She was ready!"" Her spirits were high going in, he said. She was laughing and chatting with her doctors. Because of privacy regulations, CNN was not on hand Thursday and doctors were prevented from speaking directly about her case. The haunting story and image of Aesha, now 22, became known the world over after her face appeared on the cover of Time magazine in August 2010. That same month she arrived in California, welcomed with the best of intentions by people wanting to help her start over with a new and restored face. But Aesha, who effectively became a poster child for the oppression of women in Afghanistan, wasn't emotionally prepared for the grueling process that awaited her. Until now, and amid several moves, that hoped-for surgery remained elusive. In May, 16 months after meeting Aesha, CNN published an exclusive piece documenting her complicated and winding journey in America. We set out to tell her story because the last the world knew, she was well on her way to a fairytale ending. We wanted readers to understand the truth: that fairytale endings aren't always possible, especially for someone with Aesha's challenges. The responses from readers were overwhelming. Some messages we received were more surprising than others. Many wanted to give donations to support Aesha. Others offered their own stories, tips to pass along to those caring for Aesha, as well as medical and psychological diagnoses. People in Afghanistan -- U.S. troops, NGO workers and a Kabul blogger -- reached out, as did a man who knew her on the base where she first was brought after being brutalized and left to die. A New Yorker in the fitness business asked to send Aesha workout clothes -- with the hope that someday she might interview Aesha for a program she calls ""Celebrity Sweat."" Someone in Atlanta offered to choreograph and teach Aesha her very own Bollywood dance. A poet penned a piece to honor her. Aesha and the Frederick, Maryland, couple caring for her, Mati Arsala and Jamila Rasouli-Arsala, need the well wishes and good vibes now more than ever. This medical odyssey will be a long and difficult one. The team assembled to work with Aesha did their best -- even putting together a three-hour presentation, the Arsalas say -- to prepare all of them for what was to come. ""Finally, she took the first step,"" Jamila said Thursday night. ""I hope everything will be good."" A week before her surgery, we sat down with Aesha and her adopted family, including her 14-year-old ""sister,"" Miena Ahmadzai, to talk about how they were feeling. ""I'm not scared. I'm happy,"" Aesha said, sitting between Jamila and Miena, all three of them wearing necklaces Aesha created. Given all she's been through, the years of abuse and the mutilation of her face, surgery is nothing to be afraid of, she said in Pashto. ""I suffered a lot in my life,"" she said, as Jamila translated. ""Now I feel that a light comes into my life."" She held hands with Miena, with whom she's become very close, the two only letting go to unwrap and chomp on chocolates plucked from a heart-shaped candy box in front of them. The next day Miena, Jamila's daughter by her first husband, was boarding a plane to spend a month in Germany with her father and family there. Miena said she was sorry she wouldn't be around after the initial surgery, but she knows that she and Aesha will talk and visit with each other by Skype. Miena looked over at Aesha with a grin and gave her own prediction of how things will go: ""I'm pretty sure, once she gets all her surgery, she'll have a lot of guys drooling."" ""Aii, Miena!"" Aesha screamed, her eyes as wide as her smile as she play-swatted her friend. The Arsalas and Aesha said they were ready for what awaits them. This is what she's wanted for so long, and they take great comfort in the confidence they have in the doctors who will be caring for her. Walter Reed Bethesda, the shortened name for the facility that combines the former Walter Reed Army Medical Center and the National Naval Medical Center, is the world's largest military medical center. U.S. Rep. Roscoe Bartlett and his office secured Aesha's treatment at the medical center. That the military, so often associated with violence, would step up to do this fills the Maryland Republican with pride. People ""know we take care of wounded soldiers. That's kind of an obligation; what else could you do? But this -- you don't have to do this. ... It puts a real human face on our military,"" he said. ""How can your heart not go out to Aesha?"" Aesha will also have additional support from Fahima Vorgetts, Jamila's cousin, who introduced Aesha to the Arsalas. Vorgetts, who lives in West Virginia about an hour away from the Arsalas in Maryland, travels often. But she said she has carved out time to be there after the surgery and is prepared to help care for Aesha during her recovery. Vorgetts marvels at Aesha's smile and ability to be loving, despite all she's been through. ""She has this innocence about her, but she's also very smart and she understands things, Vorgetts said recently of Aesha. ""I think she has, and I hope she has, a brighter future."" The road will not be an easy one to travel. Over the course of her multiple surgeries, there will be plenty of pain and discomfort, not to mention the emotional toll she will experience as she watches herself look far worse before she will look better. Thursday's surgery, which set her up to have skin in her forehead expanded for future use in rebuilding her nose, is only the beginning, Mati said. But by the time he left her room Thursday evening, he said she seemed more than up for the challenge. ""She's in a private room. She's awake. She ate. She had a hamburger, fruit, ice cream and yogurt. And did I say fruit? She ate like a pig, "" he said with a tired laugh. ""It's only beginning, but it was very successful."" To support Aesha in her surgical journey, CNN iReport is asking people who have undergone reconstructive surgery to share their stories. Some already have. Submitted videos will be pieced together and played for Aesha so she knows she is not alone. The family caring for Aesha has also set up a website, Aesha's Journey, so people can follow her progress, send her notes, make direct donations to her personal account and even reach out to buy her handcrafted jewelry. All this, the Arsalas hope, will help Aesha gain the life she deserves.

"Washington (CNN) -- After progress earlier this week in fiscal cliff negotiations, President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner butted heads Wednesday, setting the stage for a showdown as the deadline looms for an agreement. The negotiations had focused on a $2 trillion package of new revenue, spending cuts and entitlement changes the two sides have shaped into a broad deficit reduction plan. Boehner on Tuesday proposed a ""plan B,"" which would extend Bush-era tax cuts on income of up to $1 million. He described it as a fallback option to prevent a sweeping tax hike while negotiations continue on a broader plan. But the White House on Wednesday threatened to veto ""plan B,"" saying it would bring only ""minimal"" changes in projected budget deficits. Obama told reporters earlier in the day that Republicans were focused too much on besting him personally rather than thinking about what's best for the country. ""Take the deal,"" Obama said to Republicans, referring to the broader proposal, adding that it would ""reduce the deficit more than any other deficit reduction package"" and would represent an achievement. ""They should be proud of it,"" Obama said. ""But they keep on finding ways to say 'no' as opposed to finding ways to say 'yes.' "" His comments at a White House news conference came less than two weeks before the end of the year, when the nation's taxpayers would face automatic tax increases and deep spending cuts if no agreement is reached. Economists say that failure to reach agreement could spark another recession. Boehner issued his own statement Wednesday, saying the president had yet to make a proposal offering a balance between increased revenue and spending cuts. In a 52-second appearance before reporters, Boehner said the House will pass his fallback plan Thursday limiting tax increases to income above $1 million. While the plan represents a concession from Boehner's original vow to oppose any tax-rate increase, it sets a higher threshold than the $400,000 sought by Obama. Once the House passes his plan, the president can either persuade Senate Democrats to accept it or ""be responsible for the largest tax increase in American history,"" Boehner said before walking off without answering shouted questions. The Obama administration and congressional Democrats said Boehner changed course because he was unable to muster Republican support for the larger deal being negotiated with Obama. At his news conference, Obama alluded to last Friday's Connecticut school shootings in calling on Republicans to put aside political brinksmanship. ""If there's one thing we should have after this week, it should be perspective about what's important,"" he said. ""Right now, what the country needs is for us to compromise,"" he continued. He characterized as ""puzzling"" the GOP refusal to accept his compromise. Asked why an agreement was proving so elusive after both sides had made concessions, Obama said it might be that ""it is very hard for them to say 'yes' to me."" ""At some point they've got to take me out of it,"" Obama said of Republicans, adding they should instead focus on ""doing something good for the country."" Boehner responded by arguing that Obama's proposal was not evenly balanced, with more new revenue instead of the spending cuts and entitlement reforms Republicans seek. The Boehner plan B would leave intact government spending cuts, including those related to defense, which are required under a budget deal reached last year to raise the federal debt ceiling. The threat of cuts was intended to motivate Congress to reach a deal. Opinion: Art that calls the fiscal cliff's bluff . But Obama said Wednesday that Boehner's proposal ""defies logic"" because it raises tax rates on some Americans, which Republicans say they do not want, and contains no spending cuts, which Republicans say they do want. He also criticized the measure as a benefit for wealthy Americans, who would have lower tax rates on income up to $1 million. The White House and congressional Democrats say plan B has no chance of passing; Obama said that bringing it up only wastes time. Senior administration officials said Obama and Boehner have not spoken to each other since Monday. GOP leaders planned to vote Thursday on Boehner's proposal, as well as Obama's long-standing proposal to return to higher tax rates of the 1990s on income above $250,000 for families. Obama on Monday raised the threshold for the higher tax rates to $400,000. Conservative allies publicly supported Boehner's plan Wednesday. Anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist provided political cover for Republicans who have signed his pledge against tax increases, saying he could support plan B. Obama and Democrats argue that increased revenue, including higher tax rates on the wealthy, must be part of broader deficit reduction plan. Obama made the tax proposal a theme of his re-election campaign, arguing that it would prevent a tax increase for middle-class Americans. Polls show support for the Obama plan, and some Republicans have called for acceding to the president on the tax issue in order to focus on cuts to spending and entitlement programs. Budget experts: Fiscal cliff deal could disappoint . Boehner and Republicans initially opposed any rise in tax rates but agreed to raising revenue by eliminating some deductions and loopholes. The offer of a plan with higher rates for millionaires represented a further concession, but Obama and Democrats say it would not suffice. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said Boehner's plan appeared to be a result of pressure from tea party conservatives opposing a wider deal. ""It would be a shame if Republicans abandoned productive negotiations due to pressure from the tea party, as they have time and again,"" Reid said this week. Boehner's spokesman, Michael Steel, shot back that the plan B proposal gave Democrats what they wanted -- higher tax rates on millionaires. What happens if the payroll tax cut expires . Obama's latest offer has generated protests from the liberal base of the Democratic Party because it includes cuts in entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Justin Ruben, executive director of MoveOn, which backed Obama's presidential campaigns, said its members would consider any benefit cuts ""a betrayal that sells out working and middle-class families."" In particular, liberals cited concessions that Obama made Monday in his counteroffer, including a new inflation formula applied to benefits called chained CPI. Obama offers fiscal cliff tax concession . Chained CPI includes assumptions on consumer habits in response to rising prices, such as seeking cheaper alternatives, and would result in smaller benefit increases in future years. Statistics supplied by opponents say the change would mean Social Security recipients would get $6,000 less in benefits over the first 15 years of chained CPI. But White House spokesman Jay Carney said Obama's CPI proposal ""would protect vulnerable communities, including the very elderly, when it comes to Social Security recipients."" He called the president's acceptance of the chained CPI a signal of his willingness to compromise. CNN's Dan Lothian, Dana Bash, Deirdre Walsh and Brianna Keilar contributed to this report.","White House threatens to veto Boehner's ""plan B""

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich have pulled off a major coup by successfully courting arguably the most in-demand coach in the world -- Pep Guardiola. One day after Guardiola had talked openly of his desire to manage in the English Premier League, Bayern announced the 41-year-old Catalan had agreed to coach the German club for three seasons from the start of the 2013/2014 campaign. ""Pep Guardiola is one of the most successful coaches in the world and we are sure that he can give not just Bayern, but the German football, lots of shine. We look forward to working with him from July 2013,"" Bayern Munich president Uli Hoeness told the club's website. The 41-year-old Guardiola stepped down as Barcelona coach at the end of last season after four years in charge of one of the world's biggest clubs to take a year-long sabbatical. Bayern told CNN there would be no further announcements before the German season resumes on Saturday. Guardiola enjoyed a hugely successful spell at the Camp Nou, guiding the Catalan club to 14 major honors including three league titles and two European Champions League triumphs. The news of Guardiola's appointment coincided with the announcement that 67-year-old current Bayern coach Jupp Heynckes will be retiring from coaching. ""FC Bayern today announces that head coach Jupp Heynckes has decided to retire when his current contract expires on 30 June 2013,"" read a statement on the German league leader's website. ""In his place, the club has appointed Pep Guardiola as head coach for three years from 1 July 2013."" Blog: What can we expect from 2013 CAN? Heynckes is currently in his third spell as Bayern coach having taken over from Dutchman Louis van Gaal in 2011. After a second-place finish in the Bundesliga last season, Heynckes' team lead the table by nine points at the halfway stage of the 2012/13 campaign. Guardiola had been heavily linked with a move to England, with Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United all rumored to be interested in appointing him. The former Barca captain seemed to fuel those rumors by telling the English Football Association's website: ""I've always found English football very fascinating, just for the environment, the crowd and the supporters. ""As a player, I couldn't realize my dream to play there but I hope in the future, I have a challenge to be a coach or a manager there and feel the experience of all the coaches and players that have been there. ""It is unique, to play in that league. I want to feel the supporters, the environment, the media and the style of the players and everything. ""I am still young, just 41, so I hope in the future I could be able to train there and enjoy that.""","Josep Guardiola will replace Jupp Heynckes as Bayern Munich coach .

"Dublin, Ireland (CNN) -- Tens of thousands of people demonstrated on the streets of Dublin, Ireland, on Saturday against the government's austerity plan. Irish police estimated the number taking part in the largely peaceful demonstration to be about 50,000. The protests were organized by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU), which has called the four-year plan for spending cuts and tax hikes ""savage and regressive."" Irish police said a comprehensive policing plan has been put in place ""in order to facilitate a peaceful march."" Groups of eight to 10 police officers were seen at several key intersections, monitoring the activity. Families, pensioners, the unemployed and members of unions and community groups were among the demonstrators who braved a rare dusting of snow to come out Saturday, the ICTU said. The marching route took protesters along the River Liffey to a Dublin landmark, the General Post Office. Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen announced the plan this week after agreeing to a bailout package from the International Monetary Fund and European Union, needed to tackle Ireland's massive debt. The plan saves 10 billion euros ($13.4 billion) through welfare cuts and an additional 5 billion euros ($6.7 billion) through higher taxes. There will be reductions in the minimum wage and public-sector pay, and a hike in the value-added tax on goods and services, Cowen said. The plan calls for introducing water meters, making students pay more for higher education, and requiring more Irish workers to pay income tax. Trade unions complain the plan unfairly targets lower-paid workers, while making no provision for a tax on asset wealth. They say it fails to explain how the Irish people can carry the banks' massive debts and sets out no strategy for creating jobs. ""People are angry and they've had enough of this government,"" local journalist Juliette Gash told CNN. ""They're furious because they feel like the government has handed over the keys to the country."" Journalist Peter Taggart contributed to this report.","Around 50,000 demonstrate in Dublin .

"(CNN) -- The biggest security operation ever seen in Ireland is being put in place ahead of Queen Elizabeth's visit next week. More than 6,000 Irish police officers and Defence Forces troops -- army, navy and air corps -- will be deployed in Dublin, with thousands more at other locations on the queen's itinerary. Potential threats from the air will be tackled by anti-aircraft guns, and seven military planes will patrol Irish airspace. A special forces unit is on standby in the event of a terrorist attack, and bomb disposal teams are also on high alert. Trash receptacles have been taken off the streets of Dublin, and thousands of manhole covers have been sealed while 40 kilometers of crowd-control barriers are in place around the capital. ""This will be the biggest security operation ever seen in the history of the state,"" said garda (police) spokesman Superintendent John Gilligan. It's estimated the security operation will cost 30 million euros, about $42 million. Surveillance has been stepped up on known republican dissidents, who are planning demonstrations at key stopoff points during the four-day tour. The Phoenix Park, where the Queen and her husband will be staying, will also be closed, shutting off one of the main arterial routes into Dublin. Rolling closures will affect several other main routes throughout Dublin. Parking is banned on up to 30 streets from 6 a.m. Saturday until Friday. Security forces are expected to be particularly stretched Wednesday night, with the Europa League football final taking place at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin.","6,000 police officers and military troops deployed in Dublin .

"(CNN) -- Two Finns and one Austrian believed to have been kidnapped by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula last December in Yemen have been released, the Finnish government said. The three had been abducted in Sanaa, Yemen, in December, the Finnish foreign ministry said. The Finns, identified as Leila and Atte Kaleva, and the Austrian, Dominik Neubauer, were freed and were safe in Austria. ""In view of the circumstances, they are in good condition,"" the foreign ministry said. ""The long deprivation of liberty, however, is a traumatic experience both for those abducted and for their loved ones."" The governments of Finland and Austria worked together to achieve the captives' release. Details of the kidnappings were ""murky, but it looks like they were kidnapped by AQAP militants under the protection of tribes,"" a Middle Eastern diplomat told CNN.

"Paris, France (CNN) -- Investigators seeking the cause of the mysterious crash of an Air France jet last year have significantly narrowed the area they are searching to find the wreckage, a top official said. Air France Flight 447 crashed into deep Atlantic waters on June 1, killing all 228 people aboard. Most of the bodies -- and the flight's data recorders -- have never been recovered, despite extensive searches of the ocean floor. But the French air accident investigation agency, the BEA, is still hopeful, its head, Jean-Paul Troadec, told CNN on Wednesday. ""We have determined a much smaller area which is about one-tenth of the previous area"" being searched, he said. Investigators still do not know what brought down the plane, who was at the controls when it crashed, or what the pilots did in the moments leading up to the disaster, according to their latest report, released in December. But if they can locate the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder, they should be able to determine the circumstances ""very quickly, some weeks after the readout of the recorders,"" Troadec said Wednesday. The problem is that the plane went down in extremely deep water with enormous underwater mountains. ""The area is very badly known,"" Troadec said, adding that ocean currents have not been mapped in the region, making it ""difficult to analyze the trajectory of the debris. ""We are in the middle of nowhere,"" he said. Two vessels, one American and one Norwegian, will trawl about 2,000 square kilometers in the latest phase of the search, which will last four weeks, he said. That's down from about 17,000 square kilometers in the initial hunt last year. ""So, of course, it's much more easy to try to find the recorders,"" he said. Troadec said his agency is determined to press on with the hunt, even as the investigation threatens to become the most expensive in air accident history. ""We have to perform this new phase because it's the only chance we have to explain this accident,"" he said. Patricia Coakley, whose husband, Arthur, died in the crash, said she doesn't need to know the cause of the disaster. ""It was an accident. No matter what, it's not going to help me. ... Because it's not going to bring him back, is it?"" she said. Flight 447 -- an Airbus A330 -- went down in stormy weather in the Atlantic Ocean while flying from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, France. Some debris and bodies have been recovered, and an examination shows the plane hit the water belly first, essentially intact, officials have said. Automated messages sent from the plane in the minutes before the crash showed there were problems measuring airspeed, the investigators said in December. But that alone was not enough to cause the disaster, they added. Tests have already brought into question the performance of pitot tubes, which measure the pressure exerted on the plane as it flies through the air, and are part of a system used to determine air speed. Before it crashed, Flight 447 sent out 24 automated error messages that suggested the plane may have been flying too fast or too slow through thunderstorms, officials have said. The European Aviation Safety Agency issued a directive in late August requiring airlines to replace pitot tubes manufactured by Thales Avionics on Airbus A330s and A340s. It said airlines should replace them with other Thales tubes and those manufactured by Goodrich. CNN's Claire Boube, Niki Cook and Don Riddell contributed to this report.","Not known: what brought down the plane, who was at controls, what pilots did .

"Washington (CNN) -- Members of a key Democratic-controlled Senate panel cast the first congressional votes on a sweeping bipartisan immigration reform bill on Thursday, turning back the first GOP attempts to beef up the legislation's border security provisions. The Senate Judiciary Committee met for eight hours, debating and holding votes on more than 30 proposed amendments. A majority of the amendments were adopted, but no key provisions in the 844-page bill were significantly altered. ""When it comes to border security, for whatever reason, Democrats are going to be inclined to say it is secure and Republicans are going to be inclined to say it's not,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina. ""I'm not blaming anybody, but that's the way this thing's going to break out in terms of votes."" Graham and Arizona GOP Sen. Jeff Flake -- part of the ""Gang of Eight"" senators responsible for crafting the bill -- sided with the committee's Democrats on the key votes. The four Democrats and four Republicans in the ""Gang of Eight"" have promised to oppose any major changes to the bill. ""The gang stuck together, as we were told they would, on anything that's significantly impacting their legislation that they drafted with their friends,"" said Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, a leading critic of the bill. ""I know it. And everybody needs to know it -- who's calling the shots."" Another member of the ""Gang of Eight"" on the committee, New York Democrat Chuck Schumer, urged his colleagues to ""be constructive."" ""Don't make an effort to kill a bill that is the best hope for immigration reform,"" Schumer said. This is the ""best hope to (overcome) the partisan gridlock that has strangled the Senate, the Congress and the country."" Among the amendments rejected by the committee: a proposal from Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, to block the legalization of any undocumented resident until ""effective"" control of the entire U.S.-Mexico border has been established for six months. A majority on the committee also rejected a proposal by Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz to triple the number of U.S. Border Patrol agents along the Mexican border, while quadrupling the level of equipment and other assets along the border, including cameras, sensors, drones, and helicopters. Cruz's amendment, similar to Grassley's, would have blocked any legalization of undocumented residents until ""operational control"" of the entire Mexican border has been established. Flake and other opponents of Cruz's amendment argued it would cost tens of billions of dollars -- a fiscally irresponsible move when Congress is trying to cut deficit spending. The bill as currently written commits additional resources to southern border security and establishes a new system of metrics to measure border control effectiveness, but critics insist the plan is full of holes and will ultimately do little to help stem to the tide of illegal immigration. While claiming to strengthen the border, the legislation would also create a 13-year path to citizenship for most undocumented immigrants while bringing dramatic change to labor policy on America's farms. If enacted, the plan would constitute the first overhaul of the nation's immigration policy since 1986. Proponents say the change is necessary to permanently and fairly resolve the status of roughly 11 million undocumented residents. Critics insist the proposed change amounts to amnesty, rewarding those who chose to break the country's immigration laws. The Judiciary Committee is set to continue its consideration of the ""Gang of Eight"" bill next Tuesday.","NEW: Senate Judiciary Committee considers amendments to ""Gang of Eight"" bill for eight hours .

"(CNN) -- A fatal police chase involving a teenager on a bicycle has led the Pensacola, Florida, police department to revamp its policy on stun guns, officials said. The Southern Christian Leadership Conference held a silent march for Victor Steen in Pensacola, Florida. The chase through Pensacola's streets in the predawn hours of October 3 has also raised the issue of whether a national stun gun policy is needed, a civil rights group said. Victor Steen, 17, died after being run over by a police cruiser during a pursuit. The young man, who was pronounced dead at the scene, suffered multiple blunt impact injuries, according to the Escambia County Medical Examiners Office. The chase started when officer Jerald Ard spotted Steen at a construction site about 2 a.m. and the teenager fled, according to the Pensacola Police Department. Steen was on his bicycle, pursued by Ard in his police car. Ard, 35, tried unsuccessfully to fire a stun gun at Steen, according to a police department news release. The teen eventually crashed his bicycle and fell into the path of the police car, according to Pensacola Assistant Chief Chip Simmons. Initial ""exam findings do not mention any Taser probes on the body,"" said Jeff Martin, director of the medical examiners office. Even though the teenager was not electrocuted by the stun gun, the incident has brought questions from some about safety procedures when it comes to using the weapons. Policies regarding stun guns vary from department to department, but Fred Wilson, director of operations for the National Sheriffs' Association, said that the general policy on stun guns should focus on appropriate training and an appropriate reporting system for when they are used. Officials with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, a civil rights group that advocates for a uniform federal stun gun policy, met with the Pensacola police and city officials Thursday. The organization asked the department whether its officers were trained to shoot a stun gun from a moving vehicle. After the meeting, the department changed its policy. ""Effective immediately, firing a Taser from a moving vehicle or into a moving vehicle is prohibited,"" a Pensacola police memo said. Before Steen's death, the department's policy required that officers act ""professionally"" and that stun gun use be ""reasonable."" ""If it had not been for the reckless use of the Taser gun, this tragic accident could have been avoided,"" said Dexter Wimbish of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. The organization said it will release a report in December showing that more than 400 people have died needlessly from a weapon touted as being non-lethal, Wimbish said. The victim's mother, Cassandria Steen, told CNN affiliate WKRG that the ordeal ""has been very difficult, but unfortunately, we can't deal our own hands in life."" ""He was a wonderful kid, wonderful, always loving, always wanting to hug,"" she said. ""I was his mommy, and he was my baby."" The leadership conference held a silent march from the scene where the teen died to the church where his funeral was held. At the march, Cassandria Steen said her desire was ""that we will get this thing under control; that maybe somebody else won't have to go through what I'm going through."" Ard, a four-year member of the police department, has been placed on administrative duty while the incident is under investigation, Simmons said. The officer previously had only a single warning on his record, from a minor accident. The Florida Highway Patrol and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement are handling the investigation, Simmons said. The law enforcement agency is in the fact-finding portion of its investigation, spokesman Mike Morrison said. When the investigation is complete, the department will file a report with the state attorney in Escambia County, he said. ""Our job is to gather the information, and it's up to the state attorney to determine if any charges will be filed,"" Morrison said, adding that he could not give a timeline for the report's completion. Simmons said a review of the incident would determine whether Ard's use of his stun gun was ""reasonable"" before passing any judgment on the officer. CNN's John Couwels contributed to this report.","Pensacola officer chased teen from construction site, tried to shoot stun gun at him .

"(CNN) -- Two Florida school administrators face contempt charges and possible prison time for saying a prayer at a school luncheon. Pace High School enacted a decree in January banning officials from promoting religion at school events. Frank Lay, principal of Pace High School, and Athletic Director Robert Freeman are accused of violating a consent decree banning employees of Santa Rosa County schools from endorsing religion. They face a non-jury trial September 17 before U.S. District Judge Casey Rodgers. The statute under which they are charged carries a maximum penalty of up to six months in prison, subject to sentencing guidelines. Attorneys defending Lay and Freeman call it outrageous that the two are being prosecuted for ""a simple prayer."" But the American Civil Liberties Union, whose lawsuit led to the consent decree, maintains that students have a right to be free from administrators foisting their religious beliefs on them. Still, an ACLU representative said the organization never suggested that people should go to jail for violating the decree.  Watch why lawyer thinks men did nothing wrong » . The ACLU filed suit last year against the district on behalf of two Pace students who alleged that ""school officials regularly promoted religion and led prayers at school events,"" according to an ACLU statement. Both parties approved the consent decree put in place January 9, under which district and school officials are ""permanently prohibited from promoting, advancing, endorsing, participating in or causing prayers during or in conjunction with school events,"" the ACLU said. Lay was a party in the initial lawsuit, and his attorney was among those approving the consent decree, according to the organization. In addition, the court required that all district employees receive a copy. On January 28, ""Lay asked Freeman to offer a prayer of blessing during a school-day luncheon for the dedication of a new fieldhouse at Pace High School,"" according to court documents. ""Freeman complied with the request and offered the prayer at the event. It appears this was a school-sponsored event attended by students, faculty and community members."" Attorneys from Liberty Counsel, a conservative legal group helping defend Lay and Freeman, said in a written statement that attendees included booster club members and other adults who helped the field house project, all ""consenting adults."" In a February 4 letter to district Superintendent Tim Wyrosdick in which Lay acknowledged the incident, he said that although past football booster club members ""and other adults associated with the school system"" were at the luncheon, culinary class students were in charge of food preparation and serving. Lay wrote that he asked Freeman to bless the food ""for the adults. ... I take full responsibility for this action. My actions were overt and not meant to circumvent any court order or constitutional mandate."" In response, Wyrosdick noted in a letter to Lay that in a meeting, the principal had admitted that ""you are, and were at the date of this incident, aware of the court injunction and aware that this type of action is not permissible under the injunction."" Wyrosdick recounted telling Lay that the prayer was not appropriate. ""This note is to share with you written instructions to avoid this type of action,"" the superintendent said. Both letters are in the public court file. ""It is a sad day in America when school officials are criminally prosecuted for a prayer over a meal,"" said Mathew Staver, founder of Liberty Counsel and dean of the law school at Liberty University, founded by the late Rev. Jerry Falwell. ""It is outrageous and an offense to the First Amendment to punish a school official for a simple prayer."" Liberty Counsel said it is challenging the consent decree, maintaining that it ""unconstitutionally infringes on the rights of teachers, administrators and students."" The ACLU, according to the Liberty Counsel statement, has begun ""to go against individual employees."" The organization said that neither man ""willfully violated any orders of the court."" ""We're not going after individuals,"" said Glenn Katon, director of the Religious Freedom Project for the ACLU of Florida. ""We're just trying to make sure that school employees comply with the court order."" The ACLU did not request the criminal contempt charges against Lay and Freeman, he said; the judge initiated them after seeing a reference to the incident in a motion. And the ACLU is not involved in the criminal proceedings, he said. ""We certainly never suggested that anyone go to jail,"" Katon said. Lay is not facing jail time for praying, he said, but for violating a court order. ""The moral of this story is, for us, this is about the students' right to be free from teachers and school administrators thrusting upon the students their religious beliefs,"" Katon said. ""They keep talking about the religious rights of the administrators, but the administrators and the principals don't have any right to trumpet their religious beliefs in a school setting."" Neither Lay nor Freeman has been placed on leave, according to the school district. Pace is about 10 miles north of Pensacola, Florida.","Attorneys: It's troubling that officials are being prosecuted for ""simple prayer""

"Editor's note: CNN.com has a business partnership with CareerBuilder.com, which serves as the exclusive provider of job listings and services to CNN.com. Christina Applegate, who plays Samantha on ""Samantha Who?"" would make approximately $145, 051. The guys from HBO's comedy series ""Entourage"" have it pretty good. Lounging by the pool every day, buying (and selling) movies, last-minute trips to Vegas, driving luxury cars, private jets with Kanye West to Cannes, France ... no big deal. What I'd like to know is how do they afford it? Last I checked, Vincent Chase, whose character is an up-and-coming actor, was making a good chunk of money; but he's also spending a lot. He's paying his half-brother, Emmy-nominated Johnny ""Drama"" to be his personal chef and trainer; he finances E's career as his manager; and as for Turtle ... well, he spends whatever money he has on illegal substances. So how do they do it? Easy -- they're fictional characters. In real-life, money doesn't grow on trees like it seems to on Hollywood Boulevard. Would our favorite characters' lavish lifestyles make it in on the other side of the TV screen? Here's a look at what some of this year's Emmy-nominated TV characters would make in the real world: . Dexter Morgan, ""Dexter"" -- Forensics expert . Real-life median salary: $47,680, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Dexter (Michael C. Hall) only uses his job as a forensic blood spatter analyst as a cover for his night-time job -- as a serial killer who kills bad guys. Even though he earns a decent amount, we're pretty sure money is not his top priority -- it's getting rid of the bad guys. Samantha Newly, ""Samantha Who?"" -- Vice president, real estate firm . Real-life median salary: $145, 051, according to CBSalary.com. The ""old"" Samantha (Christina Applegate) was only concerned about money, cars and designer clothes, which her six-figure salary supported. But ""new"" Samantha has far different interests, which include becoming a better person while living -- for free -- at mom and dad's. Whichever lifestyle she continues, it's likely it won't break her bank account. Don Draper, ""Mad Men"" -- Creative director, advertising agency . Real-life median salary: $41,379, according to CBSalary.com. As a successful businessman in the 1960s, Don (Jon Hamm) would probably make less than today's median salary. Despite that, he certainly made enough to cover the expenses of his ""picture-perfect"" lifestyle -- featuring cigarettes and liquor, a wife and two kids, and his extramarital affairs. Olive Snook, ""Pushing Daisies"" -- Waitress . Real-life median salary: $15,850, according to the BLS. Presumably Olive (Kristin Chenowith) doesn't rake in much additional money from tips from her services at The Pie Hole, the financially-failing restaurant where she works. Something tells us she's not in it for the money -- she just wants to be near Ned, head pie maker and apple of her eye. Alan Harper, ""Two and a Half Men"" -- Chiropractor . Real-life median salary: $65,890, according to the BLS. That salary combined with free room-and-board at his brother's house on the beach, Alan (Jon Cryer) is probably doing just fine supporting himself and his son. What we can't figure out is why his brother Charlie (Charlie Scheen), a mediocre jingle writer, is the one with the Oceanside villa and not Alan, the well-to-do chiropractor. Olivia Benson, ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"" -- Detective, special victims unit . Real-life median salary: $58, 260, according to the BLS. Olivia's (Mariska Hargitay) salary as a detective in the SVU leaves a little room for personal luxury -- if she ever chooses to put herself before her job and indulge in herself a little. Walt White, ""Breaking Bad"" -- High school chemistry teacher . Real-life median salary: $49, 420, according to the BLS. Walt's (Bryan Cranston) salary as a high school chemistry teacher isn't quite enough to pay for his chemotherapy treatments; good thing he's got a drug-dealing gig on the side that brings in enough to foot his hospital bills -- and then some. Dr. Gina Toll, ""In Treatment"" -- Psychotherapist . Real-life median salary: $180,000 for a psychiatrist, according to the BLS. ""A penny for your thoughts,"" is an understatement for Gina (Dianne Wiest). Even though she's technically retired from her position as a therapist, based on this salary, she probably secured a nice nest egg and doesn't need to charge her only client, Paul. Ned, ""Pushing Daisies"" -- Head pie maker, general manager . Real-life median salary: $21,241, according CBSalary.com. Ned (Lee Pace) probably makes a little more than this as the owner of his restaurant, which is near broke. To pad his pockets in the meantime, Ned helps a private investigator bring murder victims back from the dead to gather details to solve their murders, collecting reward money in the end. That should be enough to buy pie ingredients for a lifetime. Christine Campbell, ""The New Adventures of Old Christine"" -- Owner, women's gym . Real-life median salary: $55,201 for a health and fitness supervisor, according to CBSalary.com. As the owner of a women's gym, Christine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) probably makes upward of this listed salary.

"(CNN) -- After months of allegations of racial profiling and poor relations between the police force and populace, officials in the New York city of Rochester are vowing to tackle the issues head-on, a city councilman said Saturday. Adam McFadden told CNN that a 15-member commission will soon form to review the process by which citizens pursue complaints about police. The matter gained national attention in May after a woman was arrested while filming with her iPod camera a police encounter that she believed was a case of racial profiling. ""We are not in the policing business, we are in the people business,"" McFadden said of the committee's intent. ""We will improve the relationship between police and this community."" Police Chief James Sheppard told CNN that he welcomed the initiative. ""A lot of concerns have been brought to our attention relative to our internal process, and we'd be open to any review and any suggestions that might improve it,"" he said. McFadden made the announcement just over a month after sending a bristling letter to Sheppard, Mayor Thomas Richards and City Council President Lovely Warren in which he cites ""an overwhelming number of calls"" his office has gotten claiming improper treatment by police, most of them ""made by people of color."" ""The city of Rochester has lost control of its police force,"" McFadden's letter begins. The councilman wrote that citizens' concerns about police were ignored and ""seen as antagonistic."" He said the force should hire more minority officers, as well as more people from Rochester, and should ""stop racial profiling immediately."" ""We are now suffering the consequences of years of neglect,"" McFadden wrote. ""Our policing system is broken."" The councilman has been one of many to claim that the police force has disproportionately gone after blacks, compared to whites, especially when it comes to petty crimes. According to statistics for males 16 to 30 years old from Rochester, 104 blacks and 26 whites were arrested for such crimes in 2000; 10 years later, 171 blacks and 20 whites were arrested. This is in a city whose populace is 38.5% black, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Emily Good has said she filmed the interrogation of a black man by three white police officers in front of her house on May 12 because she was concerned it might be racial profiling. She was arrested that night and charged with obstruction of governmental administration. Prosecutors dismissed the charge on June 27. Good filed a claim this week, signaling her intent to sue Rochester police for their actions. Sheppard, the police chief, declined to comment extensively on the pending lawsuit, predicting the issue will be resolved via the legal process. ""It will go through the courts, and we'll see where it ends up,"" he said. Mike Mazzeo, head of the Rochester police union, claimed that threats were made against police officers after the incident. ""The whole situation just kind of blew up out of control,"" he said.","The Rochester, N.Y., police have come under recent criticism for racial profiling .

"(CNN) -- One of the Bible's paradoxical statements comes from St. Paul's Epistle to the Galatians: ""Power is made perfect in infirmity."" The poetic statement proclaims that when we are weak, we are strong. Pope Benedict XVI's stepping down from what many consider one of the most powerful positions in the world proves it. In a position associated with infallibility -- though that refers to formal proclamations on faith and morals -- the pope declares his weakness. Interactive: Where does the pope live? His acceptance of frailty speaks realistically about humanity: We grow old, weaken, and eventually die. A job, even one guided by the Holy Spirit, as we Roman Catholics believe, can become too much for us. Acceptance of human frailty has marked this papacy. We all make mistakes, but the pope makes them on a huge stage. He was barely into his papacy, for example, when he visited Regensburg, Germany, where he once taught theology. Like many a professor, he offered a provocative statement to get the conversation going. To introduce the theme of his lecture, the pope quoted from an account of a dialogue between the Byzantine Emperor Manuel II Paleologus and an unnamed Muslim scholar, sometime near the end of the 14th century -- a quote that was misinterpreted by some as a condemnation of Mohammed and Islam. Opinion: 'Gay lobby' behind pope's resignation? Not likely . Twice, the pope emphasized that he was quoting someone else's words. Unfortunately, the statement about Islam was taken as insult, not a discussion opener, and sparked rage throughout the Muslim world. The startled pope had to explain himself. He apologized and traveled two months later to Istanbul's Blue Mosque, where he stood shoeless in prayer beside the Grand Mufti of Istanbul. Later he hosted Muslim leaders at the Vatican at the start of a Catholic-Muslim forum for dialogue. It was a human moment -- a mistake, an apology and atonement -- all round. A similar controversy erupted when he tried to bring the schismatic Society of St. Pius X back into the Roman Catholic fold. In a grand gesture toward reconciliation, he lifted the excommunication of four of its bishops, unaware that one, Richard Williamson, was a Holocaust denier. This outraged many Jews. Subsequently the Vatican said the bishop had not been vetted, and in a bow to modernity said officials at least should have looked him up on the Internet. In humble response, Benedict reiterated his condemnation of anti-Semitism and told Williamson that he must recant his Holocaust views to be fully reinstated. Again, his admission of a mistake and an effort to mend fences. News: Scandal threatens to overshadow pope's final days . Pope Benedict XVI came from a Catholic Bavarian town. Childhood family jaunts included trips to the shrine of the Black Madonna, Our Lady of Altotting. He entered the seminary at the age of 13. He became a priest, scholar and theologian. He lived his life in service to the church. Even in resigning from the papacy, he embraces the monastic life to pray for a church he has ever loved. With hindsight, his visit to the tomb of 13th century Pope Celestine V, a Benedictine monk who resigned from the papacy eight centuries before, becomes poignant. In 2009, on a visit to Aquila, Italy, Benedict left at Celestine's tomb the pallium, a stole-like vestment that signifies episcopal authority, that Benedict had worn for his installation as pope. The gesture takes on more meaning as the monkish Benedict steps down. We expect the pope to be perfect. Catholics hold him to be the vicar of Christ on earth. He stands as a spiritual leader for much of the world. Statesmen visit him from around the globe. He lives among splendid architecture, in the shadow of the domed St. Peter's Basilica. All testify to an almost surreal omnipotence. Complete coverage of the pope's resignation . In this world, however, walked a vulnerable, human person. And in a paradox of life, his most human moment -- giving up the power of office -- may prove to be his most potent, delivering a message that, as St. Paul noted many centuries ago, ""Power is made perfect in infirmity."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mary Ann Walsh.","Sister Mary Ann Walsh: Pope Benedict acknowledged that he made mistakes .
Walsh: In firestorm over scholarly quotes about Islam, he went to great lengths to atone .
Walsh: Similarly, he quickly reversed a decision that had angered Jews and repaired ties .
Even his stepping down is a nod to his humanity and his love of the church, she says ."
"(CNN) -- Although somewhat unexpected, the election of Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio to succeed Benedict XVI has the air of a safe, compromise decision. At age 76, he does not have the physical vibrancy and personal dynamism that a younger man might have brought to Rome. Vatican watchers did not consider Bergoglio a front-runner and his name was not considered in speculation, even as the previously unimaginable selection of an American was widely discussed in the Italian media. Pope Francis, as Cardinal Bergoglio, was known as a doctrinal conservative. His emphasis on solidarity with the poor is in line with a turning away in some respects from structural criticism, favored by some in the church. His selection represents an obvious reorientation of the church to the global south, but it does not signify the possibility of doctrinal change related to contraception, abortion or same-sex marriage -- and within the church itself on matters of priestly celibacy or women's ordination. These issues have increasingly set the church in conflict with a rapidly secularizing West. Opinion: Argentina a complex crucible for Pope . Pope Francis hails from the church's growth regions in the developing world, and he can be expected to be attuned to the concerns of developing nations and their problems of inequity and human deprivation. Pope Francis is of Italian stock and was raised in a thoroughly Europeanized culture. That should put some of the cardinals, fearful of an overly thorough reform, at ease, despite the widespread feeling that ""something"" dramatic had to be done to reform the management of the Vatican and reduce the opacity of its financial infrastructure and sputtering bureaucracy. During his papacy, Pope Benedict urged the establishment of a global governing institution that could mitigate the worst excesses of economic and political globalization. The choice of the name ""Francis,"" after St. Francis of Assisi, suggests this pope will make it a priority to attend to the crying need of the global poor, those left behind by the free market's genius for wealth creation and its unfortunate tendency to deposit that wealth in a diminishing number of hands. No fan of Latin America's experiments with liberation theology, he has nonetheless proven to be a staunch defender of Latin American poor against the powerful economic and political forces that have assailed them. He'll likely offer a more pastoral face to the papacy even as, based on his past criticism of the global economic order, he is likely to continue Pope Benedict's skepticism of unrestrained free market policies. ""We live in the most unequal part of the world, which has grown the most, yet reduced misery the least,"" Bergoglio said during a gathering of Latin American bishops in 2007. ""The unjust distribution of goods persists, creating a situation of social sin that cries out to heaven and limits the possibilities of a fuller life for so many of our brothers."" Opinion: Pope Francis - A conservative who sides with the poor . Despite his reputation as an austere intellectual, as cardinal, Pope Francis showed a deft personal touch, visiting with the Argentine church's most vulnerable people, the poor and people suffering from AIDS. He has called for more pastoral care of divorced Catholics, and he memorably castigated Argentine priests who refused baptism to the child of an unwed mother as ""today's hypocrites."" ""Those who clericalize the church,"" he said, ""Those who separate the people of God from salvation. And this poor girl, who, rather than returning the child to sender, had the courage to carry it into the world, must wander from parish to parish so that it's baptized!"" Many will be watching to see how Pope Francis addresses the problem of clerical sexual abuse, scandals which have troubled the church all over the world and have yet to be adequately confronted in Latin America and other parts of the developing world. His past is more complicated than the pastoral face he has so far offered the world and Pope Francis may soon be asked to answer for positions and decisions during Argentina's ""dirty war."" Those positions have already created divisions among members of his order in South America. He has been accused of not speaking out sufficiently against the murders and ""disappearances"" during that awful period when as many as 30,000 perished. He has denied the allegations and defenders say he negotiated behind the scenes to help victims. Respected Brazilian theologian Leonardo Boff said Thursday he did not believe that Pope Francis, acting in his capacity then as Jesuit provincial, could be implicated in connection to the acts of the Argentine junta, and that he in fact assisted some of the junta's intended victims. Whatever the truth behind the allegations, the stories themselves are damaging and Pope Francis would be wise to confront them forthrightly and soon so they do not become a lingering source of speculation throughout his papacy. Otherwise, the emerging narrative of a down-to-earth man, thrust into power but mostly indifferent to the trappings of his position, driven by a special concern for the poor has proved especially encouraging to many frazzled Catholics, especially as, in a cynical time, it just may turn out to be the tale closest to the truth.

"Dublin, Ireland (CNN) -- Queen Elizabeth II's expression of sympathy for those who suffered during the long, bloody conflict between Ireland and England does not go far enough, the head of the Irish republican Sinn Fein party said Thursday. Her ""acknowledgement that the relationship between Britain and Ireland has not been entirely benign is a gross understatement,"" Gerry Adams said in a statement. The queen is on a historic four-day visit to the Republic of Ireland, the first by a British monarch since Irish independence from London 90 years ago. Adams, a pivotal figure in Northern Irish history as long-time leader of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political arm, said earlier that the queen's visit was ""premature."" But that is mild compared to incendiary language he has used in the past, according to a journalist formerly based in Ireland. ""When the queen's cousin Lord Mountbatten was killed by the IRA in 1979, (Adams) said it was an execution that was fully justified,"" Toby Harden said. Wednesday night, Queen Elizabeth expressed regret for the suffering of people on both sides. ""We can never forget those who have died or been injured, and their families. To all those who have suffered as a consequence of our troubled past, I extend my sincere thoughts and deep sympathy,"" she said. Adams said he thought her sympathy was ""genuine."" But he said it was not enough, demanding that ""the future policy of her government (be) about building an entirely new future based on genuine equality, and mutual respect."" The queen, who was applauded when she began her remarks Wednesday night in the Irish language, acknowledged the complex relationship between the neighbors separated by water and different cultures. On Tuesday she laid a wreath at the Dublin's Garden of Remembrance, which honors those who fought for Irish freedom from British rule. During a trip laced with historically significant gestures, the queen has visited the National War Memorial Gardens in Islandbridge and Croke Park Stadium, where British troops opened fire on a crowd watching a Gaelic football match in November 1920, killing 14. The massacre was sparked by the murder of 14 British intelligence officers by the Irish Republican Army. The visit has prompted police to mount a major security operation amid threats of dissident republican violence. Ireland has spent an estimated $42 million on security for the visit, according to officials. Scuffles between protesters and police broke out Tuesday afternoon in central Dublin and the Irish military defused a bomb on a bus headed to Dublin. The military had stopped a private bus in Maynooth, evacuated the passengers and found a ""viable device"" in the luggage compartment, a spokesman for the Irish national police said. The Irish War of Independence led to the partition of Ireland in 1921. The majority of the island gained independence, but six of the nine counties of the province of Ulster chose to stay in the United Kingdom, eventually becoming Northern Ireland. In the late 1960s, the conflict between mainly Protestant unionists who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK and largely Roman Catholic nationalists who want the North to be reunited with the rest of Ireland exploded into a political and sectarian war, known as the Troubles. The ensuing three decades of violence between the Irish Republican Army and loyalists claimed the lives of more than 3,000 people, most of them north of the border, and while the Good Friday Agreement, signed in 1998, effectively ended the conflict, suspicions remain. CNN's Peter Wilkinson and Fionnuala Sweeney and Journalist Peter Taggart contributed to this report.","Queen Elizabeth expresses sympathy for those who suffered during Anglo-Irish conflict .

"Winter Haven, Florida (CNN) -- It's a Lego fan's dream come true: Legoland Florida opens this weekend in central Florida, the first Lego-themed outdoor park in the United States since Legoland California opened in 1999. Built on the former grounds of Cypress Gardens, one of Florida's first theme parks, Legoland Florida has preserved much of the historical and natural beauty of its predecessor. Popular in the 1950s and 1960s, Cypress Gardens featured Southern belles in large hoop skirts walking around the carefully manicured grounds greeting guests. Its famous water-ski shows were glamorized in movies and the 1982 music album and video for the Go-Go's song ""Vacation."" After Disney World opened in 1971, Cypress Gardens' attendance started dwindling, and after several attempts to revive the park through new ownership, it closed in 2009. Legoland officials were thrilled to find Cypress Gardens available, as it's about an hour drive from Orlando, considered to be the theme park capital of the world. ""We were excited about the actual site, the heritage and history,"" said Adrian Jones, Legoland's general manager. ""We talked about the hairs standing up on the back of our neck in term of the sheer beauty."" There was criticism about Legoland's choice of Cypress Gardens, a location with a history of failure. ""We knew the problem that Cypress Garden had before,"" Jones said. But he said he believes the popularity of Legos and the beauty of the gardens will attract guests -- and, he says, annual pass sales have been strong. Legoland Florida still features a water ski show, this one featuring a Lego pirate, and an elegant Southern belle still greets guests as they enter the park -- but she's made entirely out of Legos. It took Legoland more than a year to transform the 75-year-old park's outdated and crumbling buildings and overgrown garden into a modern facility, without removing the historical charm of the cypress trees draped with Spanish moss. This week, annual pass holders were allowed a sneak peek at the 150-acre park before its official opening Saturday. ""Legoland! Legoland!"" chanted Denise Valletutti, along with her kids Savannah, 8 and Noah, 12, while their car climbed to the top of Technic Test Track, a roller coaster-like ride. The chants were quickly replaced with screams on the way down. The family skipped school in order to beat the crowds, though they plan to be there on opening day anyway. ""We'll be back whenever we can,"" Valletutti said. Legoland Florida is the largest of the five Legoland parks, located in Denmark, England, Germany, and the United States. Future parks are planned to be built in Malaysia and Dubai. There are also smaller indoor Legoland Discovery Centers around the world, including several U.S. shopping malls. Legoland Florida is geared for kids ages 2 to 12 and features 50 rides as well as Miniland USA, the heart of every Legoland Park. This park's Miniland USA features Florida destinations in the form of intricate Lego structures, including NASA's Kennedy Space Center, featuring the space shuttle spewing smoke, ready for takeoff. Designers started building Lego sculptures two years ago, with the help of a computer program that ""Lego-izes"" models into a brick pattern for assembly. The larger models are hollow, with a steel frame to keep them strong and stable in the park. But park designer Bill Vollbrecht says there's nothing special about the Legos they use to construct the models. ""We always use the parts and pieces that are available to kids at home,"" said Vollbrecht, who also designed the California park. ""It really shows that this is a real model made out of real bricks that kids can see the pieces and recognize.""","Legoland Florida opens Saturday .

"(CNN) -- Officials in Costa Rica worked Friday to mop up the damage after heavy rain and mud slides buried homes and killed at least 23 people in the Central American country, authorities said. Crews have found at least 20 people who were buried alive Thursday after pounding rains sent mud rushing over at least five homes in San Antonio de Escazu, a suburb of the nation's capital, the Costa Rica National Commission for Emergencies said. Several people were still reported missing there Friday, while three people were found dead in San Marcos de Tarrazu, a city in the central part of the country, said CNE. Another 2,639 people have sought refuge in 46 shelters, the commission said. President Laura Chinchilla has declared a state of emergency and said that Friday and Saturday would be national days of mourning. She visited an affected area in San Antonio de Escazu Friday to offer her support to the families missing loved ones. Images airing on CNN affiliate Teletica showed rescue crews digging through demolished homes. In another scene, workers at a mud-covered overturned vehicle spread a white sheet over a victim's body. Other images showed buckled roads damaged by the ferocity of the rushing water. In another area, some residents strung up a rope between two banks so people could hold on to it and walk across rushing water. Mud slides and flooding were reported in many places in the Central Valley area, which is surrounded by a handful of mountains and volcanoes. It is the most populous part of the nation. Classes were indefinitely canceled at many of Costa Rica's public schools, the education minister said on Teletica. About 800,000 people were left without safe water supplies, and residents were told to boil any water to be used for drinking or cooking.","NEW: Three additional people were found dead in San Marcos de Tarrazu .

"(CNN) -- The widow of a victim killed in last year's Colorado movie theater shooting is suing the accused gunman's psychiatrist and the university where she works. The psychiatrist should have advised police to apprehend suspect James Holmes weeks before the theater rampage, Chantel Blunk said in a civil lawsuit filed in federal court. Blunk's 26-year-old husband, Jonathan, was one of 12 people slain in the July 20 shooting. Dr. Lynne Fenton, the psychiatrist who works at the University of Colorado and saw Holmes as a patient, ""knew that James Holmes was dangerous"" and ""had a duty to use reasonable care to protect the public at large from James Holmes,"" according to the lawsuit. An attorney representing Fenton could not be immediately reached for comment Tuesday. Jacque Montgomery, a spokeswoman for the University of Colorado Denver, said officials there were aware of the lawsuit and had received notice that 11 others could be filed. Report: Holmes' psychiatrist reported behavior to colleagues . ""The University of Colorado Denver has nothing but sympathy for the victims of the Aurora Theater Shooting and their families, but in our initial review of this case, the University believes this lawsuit is not well-founded legally or factually,"" Montgomery said in a written statement. On June 11 -- more than five weeks before the shooting -- Holmes told Fenton that ""he fantasized about killing a lot of people,"" the lawsuit says. But according to the lawsuit, when a police officer asked whether Holmes should be placed on a psychiatric hold for 72 hours, Fenton ""rejected the idea."" The lawsuit accuses Fenton of negligence and said the university is also liable. In August, Fenton testified in court that her contact with Holmes ended on July 11. She said she later contacted campus police because she was ""so concerned"" about what happened during her last meeting with him, but she declined to detail what bothered her. Holmes, a 25-year-old former doctoral student in neuroscience, faces 166 charges, including murder, attempted murder and weapons offenses, tied to the rampage during a screening of ""Batman: The Dark Knight Rises."" His interactions with Fenton before the shooting have come up several times during court proceedings. Just nine minutes before he burst into the suburban mall movie theater, Holmes tried to call Fenton but failed to reach her, prosecutors have said. In September, a judge ruled that a notebook mailed to Fenton would not be accessible to prosecutors. Last week the judge overseeing Holmes's case agreed to delay an arraignment in the case to allow defense lawyers more time to pore over 30,000 pages of evidence and hundreds of DVDs and CDs. The arraignment -- a formal reading of charges by the court and, frequently, the entering of a plea by the defendant -- had been scheduled for Friday after Judge William Sylvester ruled Thursday that prosecutors had provided sufficient evidence in the preliminary hearing for the case to proceed to trial. Sylvester said he was concerned Holmes's case could be appealed if he moved too quickly with the arraignment. During that step, now scheduled for March 12, the list of charges against Holmes will be read, and he will have an opportunity to enter a plea, Arapahoe County District Attorney George Brauchler told reporters. CNN's Ashley Fantz, Jim Spellman and Casey Wian contributed to this report.","A civil lawsuit accuses psychiatrist who treated shooting suspect of negligence .

"(CNN) -- A few weeks ago, Emmanuela Kolman brought home her middle-school report card. She got an A in band, and her parents couldn't be prouder. Any parent would be pleased by an A. But for 13-year-old Emmanuela, who goes by Mano, that A in band is a symbol. It represents eight months of hard work, a collection of new skills, and, most importantly, a complete turnaround in Mano's social and academic life. Mano has high-functioning autism. That means she walks and talks a little differently than other kids, her parents say, and she's ""painfully aware"" of these differences. Some students at her Staunton, Virginia, middle school treat her ""as someone who is not very cool,"" said her father, Barry. Mano has few friends and frequently eats lunch by herself. She sometimes comes home crying because of teasing. She also experiences sudden outbursts of anger and frustration. Luckily, Mano has the dream team of parents on her side. Barry is a clarinetist and music professor at Washington and Lee University. Her mother, Grace, is a counselor working toward her Ph.D. in counseling and supervision at James Madison University. Last summer they were trying to come up with a strategy to help Mano deal with some of the bullying problems at school and decided to attempt an experiment: Barry would start giving her clarinet lessons. Why did they think music would help? There were a variety of reasons, from emotional to scientific. Her father thought it would help Mano ""channel her frustration through music."" Her mother was interested in the neuroscience behind how the brain deals with music. ""We cannot prove anything, but there are many studies that say how the brain can change when you do music-making ... the part of the brain that wasn't working very well has to find another way to work."" This is your brain on music . Plus, they both desperately wanted to give Mano a social outlet and help her become part of a group. So they began. Barry had taught clarinet to other kids Mano's age but never someone with autism. He immediately learned he would have to adjust his teaching style. The first lesson, they spent 30 minutes just putting the instrument together. ""With autism, you really need to do one thing at a time,"" he said. ""In music, you usually give about four or five commands per sentence, but for children with autism, you just can't do that. They kind of freeze; they don't know what to do first. So I had to kind of slow down."" He learned to speak Mano's language, too. When she described the different kinds of notes on a page of sheet music as looking like different types of chocolate -- dark or white -- he went with it. ""There are so many things just to get a note, all this coordination, which is very important in Mano's case,"" he said, explaining that it's sometimes difficult for children with autism to perform several tasks at the same time. But once she got it, Mano took to the clarinet ""like a duck to water."" Her parents noticed changes in her almost right away. It's been less than a year since she started playing and already, they say, her speech has improved and she's more focused in school, which has led to better grades. Although neither of Mano's parents is technically a music therapist, data published in the Journal of Music Therapy backs up their observations. A 2005 study showed that people with autism who participated in music therapy for a year improved by at least 25% in one of five areas of focus, including behavior/psychosocial and language/communication. According to the American Music Therapy Association, which publishes the journal, ""Research supports connections between speech and singing, rhythm and motor behavior, memory for song and memory for academic material, and overall ability of preferred music to enhance mood, attention and behavior to optimize the student's ability to learn and interact."" Everything I need to know, I learned in music class . But by far the biggest change the Kolmans have seen has been the improvement in Mano's social life. ""Playing music can soothe the pain of isolation and provide a safe space where she is accepted,"" said Barry. Before, Mano wasn't part of a group. Now she has the band. Her parents can tell from the way she brags about being a member that it's made a world of difference. Mano's mother cried as she described how being part of the band has affected Mano -- and the whole family. ""I wanted her to have an experience where she would feel good about herself -- that the bullying would be so small in the world that she would not fill herself with anger,"" she said. ""And this was a big change. I think the way she's dealing with bullying now is much different. She's not coming home crying as before. It's such a relief."" Barry keeps a journal about the results of teaching Mano clarinet, and he's posted suggested lesson plans for children with autism on his website. The Kolmans, who have spoken and written about their experience (including on CNN iReport) so that others can benefit, say they've received dozens of e-mails from parents of children with autism. They're planning to write a book or manual about their method, and they presented a paper, titled ""Autism Spectrum: Emotional Regulation through Clarinet Lessons,"" at last year's Virginia Counselors Association convention. As for Mano, she just loves to play in the band. When asked about the experience of taking clarinet lessons from her dad, she replied, simply, ""He's the best.""","Barry and Grace Kolman taught their daughter clarinet to help her cope with bullying .

"Buenos Aires (CNN) -- Maria Elena Bergoglio was in her home west of Buenos Aires last week when she heard the shocking news: Jorge Mario Bergoglio -- her brother -- was the new pope. In the past, she had prayed that the cardinals wouldn't pick him. ""During the previous conclave, I was praying for him not to be elected ... because I didn't want my brother to leave,"" she told CNN en EspaÃ±ol on Monday. ""It's a position that was a little selfish."" But this time around, Bergoglio said she changed her tone. ""I prayed that the Holy Spirit would intervene and not listen to me. And it didn't listen to me,"" she said, laughing. ""It did what it wanted."" Last week, soon after the white smoke billowed out from the Sistine Chapel chimney, she heard her brother's voice crackling through the telephone line. ""I almost died,"" she said. ""The telephone rang and my son answered. I heard him say, 'ooooh, God.' I couldn't believe it."" Her brother, who chose the name Pope Francis, told her not to worry and reassured her he was well -- something she's also seen watching his face as the events of recent days unfolded on television. ""I told him I wanted to hug him,"" she said, ""and he told me that we are already embracing from a distance, which is also something that I feel and that is real."" Then, the pope told her to pass along his warm greetings to the rest of the family. ""He said, 'I cannot call everyone. We are a very big family, so please send them my love. Because if I call everyone, it will empty the Vatican coffers,' "" Bergoglio said. Standing outside her house in a middle-class area about 45 minutes from Argentina's capital, she laughed Monday as she described his comments. She said it was a sign that even now, thousands of miles away in Europe and in the highest office in the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church, her brother showed the same sense of humor he displayed since their childhood growing up in Argentina. ""I think that's why he became pope ... if he had to be firm in something, he was,"" she said. ""But he was always like that, with a sense of humor."" It's clear, Bergoglio said, that her brother -- the first pope from Latin America -- will be a pope for the masses. ""I feel like the church opened its doors, and said to the world, ""Here I am. I belong to everyone. I am not from one continent, but absolutely belong to everyone.'"" She dismissed concerns raised by critics who accuse Francis of being complicit with Argentina's brutal military dictatorship from the 1970s -- an accusation the Catholic Church denies. ""I am sure, and that is where my calmness is born, that my brother didn't participate in that,"" she said. ""I don't like to get involved in destructive and scandalous matters. Those rumors are destructive and my purpose is to construct,"" she said. ""So let them say what they want."" Why Francis? New pope explains his new name .

"Madrid (CNN) -- He's fast on the football field but apparently even faster behind the wheel. Real Madrid star striker Karim Benzema was clocked driving 216 kilometers per hour (about 134 mph) -- more than double the speed limit -- before dawn on February 3 on a Madrid highway, and he could lose his license for at least a year, a Traffic Directorate spokeswoman told CNN. Civil Guard vehicles clocked and photographed the alleged speeding offense of Benzema in a 100 kph (62 mph) zone on the M40 ring road in western Madrid, said the spokeswoman, who by custom is not identified. Benzema was driving an Audi. The company is an official sponsor of Real Madrid, and all players on the first team have an Audi at their disposal, a Real Madrid spokesman said. The Civil Guard radar trap consisted of two sets of vehicles, one on the highway with a radar camera, which Benzema passed quickly, and a second down the road. Authorities did not immediately pursue Benzema, because of darkness and safety concerns for other drivers. But they did get the license plate number and later tracked the vehicle to him, the traffic spokeswoman said. The incident occurred hours after Real Madrid suffered an unexpected loss to Granada in a league match, on the evening of February 2. Real Madrid would not comment on the incident other than to say that club policy lets the player directly handle a traffic violation. Spanish media reported that Benzema, 25, a French international, made an initial appearance before an investigating magistrate Thursday. The sanctions could include losing his driver's license for one to four years. In addition, he could receive up to six months in jail, a fine, or several weeks or months of community service, the traffic spokeswoman said. Benzema did not play in Real Madrid's victory over archrivals FC Barcelona last Tuesday in the semifinals of Spain's Copa de Rey, or King's Cup, but the club spokesman said that was a decision of coach Jose Mourinho and was unrelated to the alleged traffic violation. Some Spanish media reported that a second vehicle was speeding alongside Benzema's that night, but the traffic spokeswoman said Civil Guards are aware of only the vehicle that Benzema was driving.","Police say Karim Benzema was clocked at 216 kph in a 100-kph zone on a Madrid highway .

"(CNN) -- An online campaign has started to right a 22-year-old wrong committed against legendary architect Denise Scott Brown. She and Robert Venturi, her partner and husband, have designed iconic buildings together for 40 years -- yet she was excluded when Venturi was awarded the highest honor in architecture in 1991, the Pritzker Prize. The cause has created an unusual outcry across the architecture profession. Started by two young women active in the Women In Design club at Harvard University, the Change.org campaign has generated more than 11,000 signatures, nine of whom are Pritzker winners. It's a worthy cause, and reflects the dismissive attitude toward women in architecture even today. Endowed by the Pritzker Family, the $100,000 prize has twice been awarded to pairs of architects, both times at the request of the individual to whom the award was originally intended to go. With only one exception, however, female partners have consistently been overlooked. Just last year, Chinese architect Wang Shu was honored without his partner and wife, Lu Wenyu. Only two women have won the Pritzker Prize in its 34 year history. Since 1991, Venturi has repeatedly insisted that Scott Brown was an equal collaborator and should share the honor with him. It's not a hard case to make: Scott Brown co-wrote the highly influential book ""Learning from Las Vegas"" in 1972, and has been widely known and appreciated in the field. Scott Brown described Venturi as being ""as brave as you could possibly expect him to be"" in his support. Still, they decided ""we could not afford to pass up the Pritzker Prize for the sake of our fledgling firm."" She is calling for a ceremony to recognize her contributions to the firm's work, which includes the Sainsbury Wing of the National Gallery in London and the Vanna Venturi house. Zaha Hadid, one of the two female Pritzker honorees, has admonished her profession, saying she doubted anything has changed for women in architecture over the last 30 years. ""I have quite a few senior architects in the office and they are extremely reliable and very talented, but, when I taught, all of my best students were women,"" she told The Observer. ""Then they drift off."" What Hadid characterizes as ""drifting off"" is, in truth, a mass exodus. Although just about as many women as men study in American architecture schools, only about 16% of the licensed architects in the United States are women. The number is slightly higher in the United Kingdom, where around 20% of qualified architects are women. Like other professions with notoriously ""leaky pipelines,"" many women drop out of architecture during the onerous final stages. After five to seven years of education, aspiring architects must complete an internship and a costly, multipart licensing exam, which takes an average of 8.5 years to complete. Only then, after years of low pay, does the profession confer the title of architect. This career phase directly corresponds with women's childbearing years, forcing many to choose between becoming a mother or an architect. To be sure, a precious few do both, but they often have a partner who stays home or they can pay someone else to provide domestic labor and child care while they put in long hours at the office. But it's not just the licensing process and the culture of workaholism that push women out. It's also sexism in the workplace and the profession at large. In a January 2013 study by The Architects' Journal, nearly two-thirds of British female architects said they have suffered gender discrimination or male bullying at work. Nearly half the women reported they received lower pay than their male counterparts, and 60% said they have encountered building industry clients who failed or refused to recognize their authority. No comparable study has been completed in the United States. As has so often been said, you can't be what you can't see. It's not easy for women who aspire to be architects to find female role models. Women are just a small minority of firm leaders. A survey conducted by the American Institute of Architects found that in 2012, women made up only 17% of firm principals and partners. Just two women have served as presidents of the AIA in its 155-year history, although a third will do so in 2014. The AIA's recent promotion of Mattel's ""Architect Barbie"" doll as a recruitment tool to interest young girls overlooks the cultural and institutional sexism in the profession. When asked about the AIA, Scott Brown reported that each time Venturi has been put forward for the organization's highest honor, the Gold Medal, the couple responded as a team. ""The AIA has always returned the submission, unopened,"" she said, because the organization knew Venturi and Scott Brown were applying together. In the end, Denise Scott Brown receiving equal recognition for a 22-year-old slight is not the point. The bigger issue is that the gender disparity in architecture, both symbolically and substantially, is not just a problem for women; it's a problem for all of us. How might our shared built environment -- our homes, hospitals, schools, workplaces and public spaces -- be shaped differently if women were behind half the proverbial blueprints? How would it be different with the contributions of architects from racial minority groups, who make up only 2% of the profession? It is not a question of whether, but to what extent, buildings are less beautiful, less functional, less equitable because women are not creating them. Winston Churchill famously noted, ""We shape our buildings, and afterward our buildings shape us.""

"Islamabad (CNN) -- When Nusrat Begum walks in to our Islamabad office she arrives accompanied by her 17-year-old son and her brother. Where she is from, in Pakistan's tribal border region close to Afghanistan, it would be unthinkable if she didn't have male relatives with her. Even so I am struck that while campaigning for one of the most powerful jobs in the land, to be a member of Parliament, she is hobbled in a way no male candidate will be. As she puts it, ""As a woman it's hard because women are helpless and men are more confident so they have an advantage and can do anything."" Despite the strictures on her life, she has respect for her roots. When we first talk she begins her opening remarks, ""Bismullah,"" in the name of God. It is a sign of respect for all she has grown up with. Nevertheless her campaign to be the first female representative from her tribal region is against the current of its conservative tribal and religious culture which, for the most part, relegates women to a life of relative drudgery, child-rearing and cooking. Her own experiences are a little different. In the mountainous region of Dir where she is from she is the one in her family who draws water from the well at their house. She alone cooks the family food over an open fire in the yard, and when it's all done she alone washes the dishes while crouching in the dirt. It is a heritage that is holding back so many of Begum's contemporaries, but not her. I want ""to give women their rights, the rights that they deserve, I have come out to help people and help the poor people,"" she tells me. After just a short conversation it is easy to see why she above others might be willing to raise herself up. There is a strength and determination about her which she is all too aware she will need. ""Dir is very conservative, but I came out because I wanted things to get better, so there can be peace, and end unemployment and to do something for our country."" It is a risky campaign made more dangerous by the Taliban. Where she comes from in Dir, they are never far away and she is challenging all that they stand for. The Taliban don't want to see women educated, they want a status quo, even a regression where women will have a lesser role than Victorian children. Back then children were at least seen if not heard, the Taliban -- if they could -- would silence women forever and confine them to their homes. But Begum sees what's happening in Pakistan's bigger cities where women have even become government ministers. ""The times have changed, there's a lot of progress, women are coming out, and going to school, going to their jobs. Some are engineers, some work with computers, some are teachers."" Her campaign is a tough one, a seven-year veteran of cricket star-turned-politician Imran Khan's party, she had hoped to be picked to represent him in the region. Instead that pick went to a man. Khan's party officials tell me they have to respect candidates who've been with the fledgling party longest and put them forward. Begum fears backhanders have been paid by the other candidate so he can benefit from the boost party backing will undoubtedly bring him. The facts may never be known. Khan's party is fighting in part on an anti-corruption ticket but if Begum struggles to win the support of Khan's party, which prides itself as progressive and pushing women's issues, it shows Begum's fight is far from done. If she does make it to elected office, she knows exactly where to start to turn her region's centuries-old attitudes to women. ""With education they can look after their children and do something for their people and country, moving forward."" Today, where Begum stands, that seems like a long shot, but in a generation, if she gets her way, old attitudes could fade and women assume a fuller role in shaping Pakistan's future.","Nusrat Begum the first female parliamentary candidate from her tribal region .

"(EW.com) -- Even Tony Stark would be impressed with ""Iron Man 3's"" incredible domestic opening weekend. Disney's $200 million superhero sequel earned $175.3 million in its first three days in North America from 4,253 theaters â€” the second best opening weekend of all time behind ""The Avengers'"" $207.4 million bow on this weekend a year ago. The film managed a robust $41,218 per theater average and got a big boost from IMAX screens, which accounted for $16.5 million of its opening weekend gross. About 45 percent of tickets sold were in the 3-D format. Like ""The Avengers,"" ""Iron Man 3"" played to a broad spectrum of demographics with a tilt toward older men. According to Disney, audiences were 55 percent above the age of 25 and 61 percent male. Disney also reports that couples made up 52 percent of viewers, while families accounted for 27 percent, and teens 21 percent. Movie trailers: Survey finds many turned off by seeing best scenes in promos . ""Iron Man 3"" opened higher than both ""Iron Man"" ($98.6 million) and ""Iron Man 2"" ($128.1 million), which isn't all that surprising given that it's arriving after ""The Avengers,"" which earned $623.4 million domestically and became the biggest hit of 2012. It's difficult to imagine that ""Iron Man 3"" could have garnered such impressive numbers without the boon of ""The Avengers"" â€” especially because ""Iron Man 2"" was tepidly received by most viewers and ultimately finished with less than ""Iron Man"" ($312.4 million vs. $318.4 million). It's to Marvel's credit that they were able to augment interest in the ""Iron Man"" franchise with ""The Avengers."" Dave Hollis, Disney's head of distribution, says ""The Avengers'"" popularity has absolutely played a part in ""Iron Man 3's"" success â€” and that it's expected to boost prospects of both the ""Thor"" and ""Captain America"" franchises as well. ""We sat here a year ago with 'The Avengers,' and there was speculation of what the impact of such a big weekend and the coming together of all these heroes might mean for each of the subsequent films,"" he says. ""[W]e're first-hand witnessing that the brand is as strong as it's ever been."" 'Iron Man 3' does WHAT to The Mandarin? -- SPOILER ANALYSIS . He's right about that. ""Iron Man 3"" earned a solid ""A"" CinemaScore, and positive word-of-mouth could propel the film to a domestic finish in the $400 million range, though it faces ample competition over the next few weeks from ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" and ""Fast & Furious 6."" Still, ""Iron Man 3"" already seems like the probable winner of the summer box office crown. Globally, ""Iron Man 3's"" total stands at an estimated $680.1 million after 12 days of release. In China, the film's number one international market, it's earned a stunning $63.5 million after just five days. ""Iron Man 3's"" $504.8 million international haul already trumps ""Iron Man 2's"" $311.5 million international total, and the three-quel appears to be headed for an overseas gross in line with ""The Avengers'"" $888.4 million total. (""The Avengers"" ultimately earned $1.5 billion globally.) Basically, ""Iron Man 3"" is a lock for a finish above $1 billion worldwide, and right now, a tremendous $1.2 billion total seems likely. For star Robert Downey Jr., who portrays wise-cracking billionaire Tony Stark, ""Iron Man 3"" marks the latest incredible success in his Hollywood comeback. A little more than a decade ago, the actor's career appeared dead in the water due to substance abuse arrests and rehab stints, but he's made a turnaround that so few troubled stars ever do. Thanks to the success of the ""Iron Man"" films, ""The Avengers"" and the ""Sherlock Holmes"" franchise, Downey Jr. has starred in a film that grossed over $500 million globally in each of the last five years. Robert Downey Jr. straps on his movie promotion suit for 'Daily Show' interview . Of course, there were some other movies at the box office this weekend, too. Last weekend's champ, ""Pain & Gain,"" plummeted 63 percent to $7.6 million, bringing its total to $33.9 million after ten days. While that's not a great result, the Michael Bay-directed action flick cost just $26 million. In third place is Warner Bros.' only hit this year, the baseball drama ""42,"" which brought in another $6.2 million for a $78.2 million total. The $40 million film may finish with about $90 million domestically. Fourth place belonged to Universal's Tom Cruise vehicle ""Oblivion,"" which fell by a distressing 67 percent to $5.8 million in its third weekend for a $76 million total. The film has proven exceedingly front-loaded both in the States, where it opened with $37.1 million just two weeks ago, and overseas. Worldwide, ""Oblivion"" has earned $222 million, which likely is not enough to offset the substantial costs of production (""Oblivion"" had a $120 million budget), distribution, and marketing. ""The Croods,"" a $135 million Fox-distributed/DreamWorks-made animation, finished in the top five once again with $4.2 million, marking a drop of 37 percent. After seven weekends, the caveman comedy has earned $168.7 million (the fact that ""Iron Man 3"" surpassed that total in just three days is remarkable), and now stands as the third-highest grossing domestic release of 2013 behind ""Oz The Great and Powerful"" ($228.6 million) and ""Iron Man 3."" Worldwide, ""The Croods"" has earned a whopping $517.9 million. 1. ""Iron Man 3"" -- $175.3 million . 2. ""Pain & Gain"" -- $7.6 million . 3. ""42"" -- $6.2 million . 4. ""Oblivion"" -- $5.8 million . 5. ""The Croods"" -- $4.2 million . Next week brings the release of the hotly anticipated adaptation ""The Great Gatsby,"" as well as Tyler Perry's latest, ""Peeples.""

"(CNN) -- The ""Mona Lisa"" has been to the moon and back -- or at least a digital image of her. The famous face was used in an experiment and carried in a laser beam to a man-made satellite orbiting the moon, NASA said Thursday. The successful transmission is a significant achievement -- which Renaissance painter Leonardo da Vinci would have surely appreciated -- because it marks ""the first time anyone has achieved one-way laser communication at planetary distances,"" said principal investigator David Smith of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. By using lasers, NASA is now on the verge of revolutionizing and speeding up delivery of data now dispatched from outer space and all around the solar system, the agency said. Laser technology is used in CDs that have made albums obsolete, and now it holds the promise of bringing live, high-definition video feeds from far reaches of the solar system, including Jupiter, NASA said. ""In the near future, this type of simple laser communication might serve as a backup for the radio communication that satellites use,"" Smith said in a statement. ""In the more distant future, it may allow communication at higher data rates than present radio links can provide."" Read more space and science news on CNN's Light Years blog . The enigmatic ""Mona Lisa"" countenance was digitized and traveled via laser almost 240,000 miles from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, to the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. Satellites beyond Earth use radio waves for tracking and communication, but the moon satellite is the only one to rely on lasers for tracking, NASA said. NASA found a way to use that laser to deliver the ""Mona Lisa""image to the satellite, which in turn confirmed its receipt by sending the image back to Earth using traditional radio telemetry. The image transmission wasn't perfect and suffered defects because the Earth's atmosphere caused errors, even when the sky was clear, NASA said. Scientists fixed the errors by using the same error-correction code used in CDs and DVDs, NASA said. The ""Mona Lisa"" experiment was transmitted at a slow data rate of about 300 bits per second, but the ""pathfinding achievement sets the stage for ... high data rate laser-communication demonstrations that will be a central feature of NASA's next moon mission, the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer,"" said Goddard's Richard Vondrak, the orbiter's deputy project scientist.

"(CNN) -- Petra Kvitova will use the expectation of being defending champion to help her when she begins her Wimbledon campaign. The Czech beat current world No.1 Maria Sharapova at the All England club last year to claim her first grand slam title, and will start this year's tournament on Centre Court against Uzbekistan's 97th-ranked Akgul Amanmuradova. ""It's very big pressure for sure,"" the 22-year-old told CNN when asked about returning to the prestigious grass-court grand slam. ""But without pressure it's boring. So I will try to work on my game so that when I step onto Centre Court I'm focused."" Djokovic, Sharapova head Wimbledon seedings . The left-handed Kvitova is excited to return to Wimbledon, although she will be heading to the London venue earlier than planned after crashing out of the warm-up event at Eastbourne in the first round. ""It's a very special place to me. I will be honored to return to Wimbledon as the defending champion,"" added Kvitova, who was knocked out of the Australia Open and French Open by Sharapova at the semifinal stages. ""I would have liked to have played more matches, but I have more days for practice,"" said the Czech. ""I can improve my game and I can go there earlier than I expected. I'm looking forward to being at Wimbledon."" The world No. 4 explained how her 6-3 6-4 victory over Sharapova was a dream come true and that Wimbledon has a distinct aura which is not present at other tournaments. ""You cannot be serious!"" Tennis' top tantrums . ""All players want to win Wimbledon, it's something that money can't buy,"" said Kvitova, who is seeded fourth. ""The grand slam at Wimbledon is very special to everyone, it's on the grass, you play in the whites and it has all the history and the atmosphere."" Despite her shock straight-sets loss to Ekaterina Makarova at Eastbourne on Monday, Kvitova feels her game is well suited to the grass. ""I'm happy with my game, I can improve for sure. I play well on the grass ... although I haven't had too many chances to play on the grass this season."" Unlike the men's game, which has been dominated by Serbia's Novak Djokovic, women's tennis has seen a number of players clinch grand slam titles -- the last six major tournaments have had six different winners. Kvitova expects French Open winner Sharapova and Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka, who she beat in the Wimbledon semifinals last year, to be her main challengers over the Wimbledon fortnight. ""Women's tennis is very open right now, big players can play well on the grass. Maria has had a great season and she played so well at Roland Garros. ""Azarenka as well had a very good start to the season and plays very nice on the grass. There are a lot of players who can play very well. ""We are all fighting because we know we have a chance, it's not just me who is the only good player who can win everything. Not at this time, but maybe in the future."" Sharapova, Wimbledon champion in 2004, has been drawn against Russia-born Australian Anastasia Rodionova, while second seed Azarenka, who could be set for another semifinal showdown with Kvitova, will play American Irina Falconi. Four-time champion Serena Williams is up against Czech Republic's Barbora Zahlavova Strycova, while Polish third seed Agnieszka Radwanska is playing world No. 121 Magdalena Rybarikova. Former world No.1 Caroline Wozniacki will begin her quest for a maiden grand slam title with a first round match against Austria's Tamira Paszek. Unseeded Belgian Kim Clijsters, a winner of four grand slam titles, has been drawn against 18th seed Jelena Jankovic. But former world No. 1 Clijsters' participation in the event has been called into question after she pulled out of warm-up event in the Netherlands with a stomach strain. In the men's draw, defending champion Novak Djokovic opens up against former top-ranked Spaniard Juan Carlos Ferrero. Switzerland's 16-time grand slam winner Roger Federer, a six-time Wimbledon champion, could face Serbia's Djokovic in the last four. Third seed Federer will play No. 43 Albert Ramos. French Open champion Rafael Nadal could face fourth seed Andy Murray in the last four for the third year in a row. Second seed Nadal has drawn against Brazilian Thomaz Bellucci.

"(CNN) -- Making a strong first impression in the corporate world can take more than a power suit and a firm handshake. Nowadays, high-end status symbols like luxury cars are sought after by those seeking a profile boost. Yet, while a personal Maserati or Lamborghini is out of reach for all but the most well remunerated, car rental companies are increasingly adding high-end vehicles to their lots to cater to those who want more cachet from their hired wheels. Car companies have been toying with flashy cars for a few years now. Hertz first launched their Prestige Collection in the U.S. in 2001, letting clients choose from a roster of higher-profile automobiles, such as Mercedes and BMWs. Last year, though, things got a little more exciting, when the company started offering the type of elite vehicles that usually retail for six figures. Models like the Ferrari F430 Spider, Lamborghini Gallardo and Bentley Continental GT started to make an appearance alongside the usual roster of Kias and Fords. The ultra-high-end cars are part of Hertz's Supercars, which launched its web booking platform last year, unrolling it in the U.S., UK, France, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands. There is relatively limited availability, with fewer than 200 cars on offer in total. Hertz started toying with high-end rentals in 2011, when it added the Lotus Evora to its collection in Germany, Spain and the UK in just 15 locations, mainly in airports. ""We wanted to gauge the appetite for luxury car hire,"" says ZoÃ« White, a Hertz spokeswoman. Consumers proved ravenous, spurring Hertz to add more posh models in more locales. Read more: Private jets come within reach of business travelers . Enterprise Rent-a-Car conducted a similar experiment in the U.S. in 2005, when they launched their Exotic Car Collection in West Los Angeles. It should come as no surprise that rentals of fantasy cars -- think Aston Martin and Bentley convertibles -- would prove popular in a city famously obsessed with image. Enterprise recently expanded their offerings to a further 13 locations across six U.S. states. They also have the cars on prominent display at Los Angeles International Airport, where some customers upgrade their vehicle on the spot. Bookings are up, according to Steve Short, Enterprise's vice president of leisure business development, and he says the reasons for booking an expensive, luxury vehicle are myriad. ""We have local customers who want to add a special touch to a big event, out-of-towners who want to enjoy their vacation in style and business travelers who use the cars to entertain clients,"" Short says. Even though the last few years have been marked by a global recession, some believe now is the best time to focus on luxury vehicle rentals. According to Kay Ceille, the managing director at AvisBudget UK, it is partly because times are tough that luxury car rentals have become more popular. ""We found that people want to rent a luxury car in order to give the impression they are doing well for themselves,"" says Ceille. ""They want to stand out from the crowd and be taken more seriously."" Read more: Tablets and live TV transform in-flight entertainment . Through its market research, AvisBudget found their UK customer base was renting vehicles from their Prestige Collection and Select Series -- fleets comprised of upscale models from brands like Jaguar and BMW -- for the purpose of impressing someone else, under both corporate and personal circumstances. The company also found that more than a quarter of the customers they surveyed chose to upgrade before a job interview. Renting these vehicles is expensive by standard rates: a Mercedes SLK Sport can cost more than $200 per day, while a McLaren MP4-12C may fetch upward of $1,300. But compared to actually owning a one, it's a bargain. Usually, the up-market cars come with added perks, like a chauffeur hire thrown in for free or airport meet-and-greet service. ""For customers who want a taste of the millionaire lifestyle, it's value for money,"" White says.","Car rental companies are increasingly offering high-end vehicles .

"(CNN) -- A son of a former Pakistani prime minister was kidnapped Thursday in a deadly raid two days before the son was to stand for provincial assembly elections, one of his brothers told CNN . The kidnapping of Ali Haider Gilani is the latest in a string of attacks that have plagued the run-up to Pakistan's national elections scheduled for Saturday. Two gunmen in a vehicle killed two people and injured eight others as they kidnapped Gilani in Punjab province, his brother Ali Qasim Gilani told CNN. Ali Haider Gilani -- son of former Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani -- was on his way to address a public meeting in the city of Multan when the attack happened, police senior superintendent Khurram Shakur told local TV reporters. The younger Gilani has been running for a seat in the Punjab provincial assembly. Prime Minister Mir Hazar Khan Khoso called the elder Gilani on Thursday to assure him that all necessary steps would be taken to recover the son, Khoso's office said. Saturday's nationwide elections are to be Pakistan's first democratic transition of power, as the governing Pakistan People's Party is poised to become the first civilian government to complete a full five-year term. But campaigns have been plagued by deadly violence in recent weeks, and the Pakistani Taliban has claimed responsibility for several hits on candidates' campaigns. At least 16 people died Tuesday in two attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province; one attack targeted a PPP rally, and the other targeted a candidate for the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazal Ur Rehman group, police said. And on Monday, an explosion killed 18 people at a rally for Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazal Ur Rehman, a right-wing religious party with sympathies for the militant Taliban movement. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for that blast, saying it attacked because one of the candidates, Munir Orakzai, has handed over members of the Mujahedeen to the United States. Yousuf Raza Gilani was prime minister from 2008 to 2012. CNN's Tim Schwarz, Jason Hanna and Aliza Kassim contributed to this report.","Ali Haider Gilani kidnapped in deadly attack in Punjab province, brother says .

"(CNN) -- Lebanon says it deployed troops near its border with Syria Sunday after artillery shells hit a Lebanese border village. One person was killed after shells from Syria hit the town of Qasr, the Lebanese Army said in a statement. Several homes were destroyed, and three people were injured, the military said. ""Subsequently, army units were deployed widely across the area and took measures in the field necessary to protect people and respond to the source of the attack as appropriate,"" the statement said. The Lebanese military did not release additional details about the incident. Lebanon's National News Agency reported that a 13-year-old was killed when rockets from Syria hit the region Sunday. Lebanese President Michel Suleiman condemned the violence, saying in a statement on his website that rockets had fallen near Qasr's mosque. ""These kinds of acts have only resulted in the deaths of innocent Lebanese who have nothing to do with the ongoing conflict taking place outside their country,"" he said. The war in Syria has been raging since March 2011 when protesters, partly inspired by Arab Spring uprisings in the region, began demonstrating for more freedom. That movement quickly morphed into a movement against President Bashar al-Assad, who was appointed president by Syria's parliament in 2000 after his father died. The government responded with a brutal crackdown. In February, the United Nations estimated that 70,000 people had been killed in the fighting. At least 124 people were killed in violence throughout Syria on Sunday, the Local Coordination Committees opposition network said. CNN cannot independently verify death tolls or other accounts of violence in Syria.","Lebanon's military says shells from Syria hit a border town .

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- If you can't beat 'em, join 'em. Google and music companies are giving Chinese Internet users free downloads. That's the idea behind Google's latest move to allow users to download free music in China. Google has partnered with a Chinese company, Top100.cn, to make it happen. About 140 music labels have joined in, including the ""Big Four"" -- EMI Group, Sony Music Entertainment, Warner Music Group and Universal Music. Most Chinese users get their music for free anyway, thanks to rampant online piracy. Google and its partners hope the new business model will generate revenue from advertising that all will share. More importantly, Google wants to increase traffic and catch up to its competitor Baidu. ""We will provide free, high-quality, legal downloads,"" Google China President Li Kaifu told CNET News. ""Not providing music was a strategic mistake on our part.""  Watch how Google intends to curb piracy » . Baidu offers a popular search feature, which, despite lawsuits from many labels, enables users to download music through third-party sites. The company commands 62.2 percent of China's market, compared with Google's 27.8 percent, according to research firm Analysys International. Will Google's move pay off? Well, users are already streaming songs 1.5 million times per day. So far, Chinese music is topping the list of most popular downloads, including top artists Jolin Tsai and Liang Lin. But Western music isn't far behind. Favorites are ""My Life Would Suck Without You"" by Kelly Clarkson, the Backstreet Boys hit ""I Want It That Way"" and Sarah Brightman's rendition of ""Scarborough Fair."" Brightman, who co-performed the theme song at the opening ceremony of the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, is a longtime favorite among Chinese fans. Google offers about 350,000 free songs, but says more than 1 million will be available soon. The company also provides user-friendly searching and song lyrics, and recommends music based on a listener's preference. Several students at a cafe in Beijing say they have tried the service. ""I think it will bring convenience,"" one girl said. ""Baidu has some disadvantages, and sometimes they do not have high-quality music. I think Google will provide a large quantity of high-quality music."" It's no surprise that China's gregarious Internet community is having a heated discussion. ""I can't find any songs I like on it,"" one blogger wrote. ""It's good quality, but there aren't enough songs,"" another blogger said. ""It's better than buying it, though."" Some rushed to Google's defense. ""You can't really compare Google with other sites, because all of their music is legitimate,"" one blogger said. ""They pay those music labels for every download. Baidu and others all use pirated music."" Will Baidu make the next move? ""Actually, Baidu may be threatened now,"" said Internet analyst Duncan Clark. If the Chinese search site doesn't cooperate with music companies, it could be seen as ""basically aiding and abetting pirates,"" he added. ""But if there is a better service offered by Google ... then Google will threaten Baidu and Baidu will have to respond,"" Clark said. CNN's Qiaochu Wang contributed to this report.","Google free music in China averaging 1.5 million downloads .

"(CNN) -- Despite the escalating violence in Syria that led to the suspension of monitoring activities, the United Nations can continue to play a crucial role in the embattled country, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says in a report to be presented to the Security Council. An advance copy of the report, which is circulating among Security Council members, was obtained by CNN ahead of a Wednesday briefing on Syria to the council by Joint Special Envoy Kofi Annan. The document outlines the efforts to implement a six-point plan that would impose a cease-fire and take measures to protect human rights, and admits that it has not worked. In some places, the levels of violence are even higher today than they were before an initial cease-fire attempt, the report says. Military: Shelling from Syria hits Lebanon . The 300-strong U.N. team in Syria, whose mission is to observe and help implement the plan, has been unable to do its work as envisioned because of present conditions, the document states. Last month, the United Nations announced that it was pulling back its unarmed monitors because of escalating violence. Opposition groups slammed the international body for the suspension of its work. The U.N. mission's role in Syria was based on the premise that there would be a cessation to the violence, and failing that, ""a calibration of effort in response to the situation on the ground would be appropriate,"" Ban writes. Basically, the three options Ban puts on the table are: withdrawing the U.N. team, increasing its size or adding armed protection for them; or retooling the mission of the current team. Ban elaborates the most on the idea to shift the strategy of the current U.N. team. The team could retain its military observer capability and continue its fact-finding work, but with a limited scope in light of the violence in Syria, the report says. In this scenario, the U.N. mission would move its personnel from the field back to Damascus, where it would focus on pushing forward the six-point plan to the Syrian government and the opposition. ""From a central hub in Damascus, the civilian component would continue liaison and dialogue with opposition and Government representatives in the provinces as security conditions allow,"" Ban writes. The other options -- withdrawal or augmentation of the force -- could have more negative consequences than good, the report concludes. Photos: In Syrian hospital, no escape from war . Withdrawing from Syria would ensure the safety of the team, but it could signal a loss of confidence in the hopes of a cease-fire and leave the U.N. without a way to monitor progress, the report says. ""(Withdrawing) would likely precipitate a further blow to efforts to stabilize the situation on the ground, and render the prospect of a negotiated Syrian-led transition, as laid out by the Action Group, more difficult,"" Ban writes. Expanding the size of the mission, with or without armed protection, poses an ""unacceptably high"" security risk, given that there are no signs of the violence receding immediately, the report says. These options must be considered, Ban writes, because ""in spite of the best efforts of (the mission) to support the parties in the effort to de-escalate the crisis, there is not a cessation of violence, and the basic human rights whose protection is at the core of the (six-point) plan continue to be violated,"" the report says. According to the opposition Local Coordination Committees in Syria, 71 people, including 10 defectors, were killed across the country. In fighting in Aleppo Province since Friday, four Syrian troops and one opposition fighter were killed, another group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Heavy fighting was reported in Idlib, where the town of Al-Tamani'a was shelled by forces who tried to raid it, the group said. Shelling was reported in several suburbs of Damascus. The state-run SANA news agency reported at least four different incidents where ""terrorist"" attacks were foiled by security forces throughout the country. According to the agency, more than 11 fighters it identified as ""terrorists"" were killed by security forces, and at least 10 vehicles, some with weapons inside, were destroyed.

"(CNN) -- A witness to the brutal massacre in the Syrian town of Houla which left more than 100 people dead, many of them women and children, says he fears the killing will continue unless the international community takes action. ""We are human beings, not animals,"" Mahmoud Al Houli told CNN by telephone. ""I would like to call for the international community and the U.N. to save our souls, to help us find a solution. We only want freedom."" He said conditions in Houla were ""desperate,"" with medical supplies and food running low, and a build-up of military personnel in the area leaving residents dreading a second wave of attacks. ""We are very afraid that there will be another massacre,"" Al Houli added. ""Military reinforcements have been brought in, and artillery, and we are afraid that the massacre will happen again."" On Tuesday, a United Nations official said it was ""clear"" that Syrian government forces were involved in the slaughter last Friday, which he said was ""an abominable crime."" Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the U.N. human rights office, said the majority of victims died as a result of ""summary executions"" in which ""armed men... went house to house, killing men, women and children."" Syria has denied responsibility for the massacre, which it insists was carried out by ""terrorists."" Countries around the world have expelled Syrian diplomats in protest at the killings. But Al Houli said more needed to be done to prevent further tragedy. ""The situation here is very bad, very, very bad. There is a severe shortage of medical supplies in the local hospitals. Lots of people were injured, but there is a shortage of supplies to treat them with. ""Four checkpoints have been set up around the town, and nothing can enter -- no food or medical supplies can come in. The electricity has been cut off. Things are desperate."" Al Houli told CNN he was at a protest rally in the town on Friday when members of the military opened fire. ""We had a demonstration after Friday prayers, and all the men were there,"" he explained. ""The military started shooting at the demonstration."" ""After that, thugs from the regime came from the surrounding towns, to make a big massacre. ""While the men were at the demonstration, they attacked the women and children with knives and machine guns."" He said he believed the men who carried out the attack were trying to incite a sectarian conflict in the region. ""Many civilians were killed. I saw the bodies of women, children killed by knives -- I still have the image in my eyes. ""The bodies were taken to the mosques, because there were so many, there was nowhere else to put them. ""You have seen the bodies on television, on the computer, but we see them in real life."" As he spoke to CNN, a voice boomed from a loudspeaker nearby. ""Another person has died,"" he explained. ""They are making the announcement at the mosque."" Al Houli was clear who he held responsible for the tragedy in Houla. ""[President Bashar al-]Assad is a killer of children and women. ""He needs to leave Syria and get out of the country -- that's the best solution. ""If he leaves, we can go back to normal life."" CNN's Kindah Shair contributed to this article.","More than 100 people, dozens of them children, killed in Syrian town of Houla .

"(CNN) -- The Turkish government is treating around a dozen patients who have exhibited unusual symptoms suggesting they were exposed to a chemical weapons attack, a Turkish source said. ""They were not injured by any kind of conventional arms. Tests showed excessive results which produced findings to let us make that statement,"" a Turkish source with access to Turkish government findings told CNN, on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the allegations. The Turkish source was referring to an announcement by Turkey's prime minister which accused the Syrian government of using chemical weapons. ""It is clear the regime has used chemical weapons,"" said Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in an interview broadcast on NBC News Thursday night. ""There are patients who are brought to our hospitals who were wounded by these chemical weapons,"" Erdogan added, speaking through an interpreter. Erdogan said he wanted the US to ""assume more responsibilities and take further steps"" when it comes to Syria. The Turkish leader is expected to travel to Washington next week to hold talks with U.S. president Barack Obama. Erdogan was once a close ally of the Syrian president Bashar al Assad. But he gradually distanced himself from Assad in 2011, as Syrian security forces mounted an increasingly deadly crackdown on anti-government protesters. Today, Erdogan is an outspoken critic who hs repeatedly demanded Assad step down from office. Turkey hosts more than 190,000 Syrian refugees in state-run camps, as well as many more Syrians who have fled across the border to take shelter in Turkish cities and towns. In addition, Turkey has played a major role providing assistance and a relatively safe springboard for operations to Syrian opposition groups. Ambulances routinely rush war-wounded across the border from Syria to Turkey for treatment in Turkish hospitals. Ankara says it has spent hundreds of millions of dollars housing, feeding and providing medical care to Syrian civilians. The latest accusations by Turkey are not the first time allegations of chemical weapons use have emerged from Syria. The Syrian government and rebels have accused each other of using chemical weapons on the battlefield, prompting the United Nations to call for the deployment of an international team of investigators. This week, in an exclusive interview with CNN's Frederick Pleitgen, Syrian deputy foreign minister Faisal al-Mekdad declared his government ""would never use"" chemical munitions. He also accused Turkey of supply rebels with chemical weapons. Syrian rebels as well as the Turkish government have denied such allegations, and answered with counter-accusations. Last week, Syrian rebel spokesman Louay al Mokdad claimed opposition fighters had captured an unexploded canister from an alleged chemical weapons attack. Mokdad told CNN he hoped international experts would use the canister as evidence of alleged Syrian government war crimes. The deadly conflict in Syria has repeatedly spilled across borders to Turkey, prompting Turkish security forces to reinforce the frontier. At Turkey's request, the NATO military alliance deployed several Patriot missile batteries to protect Turkish border cities from the threat of Syrian missile attacks. The Turkish government appears to also be responding to more recent reports of chemical weapons use emerging from Syria. This week, Turkey's semi-official Anatolian Agency reported that a special chemical, biological, radiation and nuclear research vehicle had been deployed to one of the busiest border gates between Turkey and opposition controlled Syria.

"(CNN) -- Good move, governor. And you didn't even let on. When we chatted briefly at the White House Correspondents Dinner a few weekends ago, you looked very upbeat and energetic. I had no idea that you had undergone Lap-Band stomach surgery to lose weight . And when I wrote that CNN piece about you on February 8 saying you needed to take your doctor's advice seriously and do whatever you could to drop some pounds, I had no idea you probably had made the decision already and were heading into surgery in eight days. Congratulations! Now some are saying that your decision to make such a drastic move to drop what could be at least 100 pounds was motivated by your desire to run for president in 2016. Being 5-foot-11 and weighing at least 300 to 350 pounds at 50 might not be conducive to occupying the Oval Office as 45th president of the United States. But we know better. You told the New York Post that you did this first for your family, for your kids. Those are the same factors that led to my decision seven years ago. They also motivated men like NBC's Al Roker, Jets coach Rex Ryan and former Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. to do the same thing -- and it had nothing to do with political aspirations. ""It's so much more important than that,"" you told the Post. We'll leave that to history to decide. Still, you knew that being morbidly obese (yes, that's how you describe people who are 100 pounds or more over their ideal body weight) would be something that would ultimately kill you, probably as a relatively young man. You don't see a lot of 80-year-old obese people, do you? And, at 50, with four wonderful children, you have a lot to live for and a lot of life ahead of you. Then there's a possible future in Washington. For a public person, a governor, these decisions are terribly personal. You had to consider the risks of doing nothing or having a fairly aggressive surgery like gastric bypass -- or doing something a little less aggressive like the Lap-Band, also called the adjustable laparoscopic banding system. In that procedure, doctors put a silicone tube, which is like a big rubber band, around the top of your stomach, restricting the amount of food you can take in. They fill that tube with saline, squeezing the size of the entry into the stomach even more so you can eat even less. They can also adjust the band to allow for more food. This can result in the loss of at least 100 pounds within the first year to 18 months, but it does carry some risks. Some say you've already dropped 40 to 50 pounds, which would be typical eight to 10 weeks after the procedure. But there will be haters. Some will say that your lifestyle of excess over the years led you to this point, and that it's lazy to go under the knife to resolve such a dramatic problem rather than bear down, hit the treadmill and do it the hard way. Others will question why you decided to do the Lap-Band procedure rather than the permanent Roux-en-Y gastic bypass. Some people have had to remove the bands because they caused painful irritation and scar tissue in their stomachs. I had the Roux-en-Y procedure, which can be initially more dangerous but is often recommended for those who require dramatic weight loss in a shorter period of time. And then there will be those who said you did all this just because you want to be president in 2016. A fat president wasn't even a good look for William Howard Taft back in 1909. Some or all that may be true, but really, governor, we know there's a lot more to the story. You did this to live. You did this because 50 is just too young to drop dead of a heart attack, diabetes or a stroke. You did this for your health. Not to mention that it would be kind of sad to get out-hustled in Iowa or New Hampshire or Florida by Hillary Clinton simply because you needed to stop and catch your breath on the campaign bus. But most important, you did this so you would be around for your kids, your wife, your family, your state and your country. And I say, more power to ya... The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bryan Monroe.","Obese New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie underwent lap band stomach surgery to slim down .

"(CNN) -- The Gonzaga Bulldogs have the most wins, 31, going into Thursday's NCAA tournament. They have the fewest losses, two. They were a consensus No. 1 going into Selection Sunday and are the No. 1 seed in the tourney's West Region. Yet they're still underdogs. Where's Rodney Dangerfield when you need him? Ken Pomeroy, the hoops statistician behind kenpom.com, said he believes the Zags earned their No. 1 seed, even if he doesn't agree with the polls proclaiming them the nation's best. ""They're seeded appropriately based on my ratings,"" said Pomeroy. ""I will vouch for Gonzaga being a very good team."" If you feel a ""but"" coming, your Spidey sense is well-tuned. Pomeroy, a meteorologist whose work on ""tempo statistics"" has earned him respect among many coaches and analysts, said he believes the sportswriters and coaches who dictate the national rankings are overvaluing the Zags' record. The voters may even be unduly charmed by the prospect of a small-conference school from Spokane, Washington, winning the whole shebang, he said. It is, after all, quixotic to think that a private, Jesuit school named for a 16th-Century saint has the same shot as Louisville or Indiana. But (there it is!) Pomeroy's statistics indicate there are three clear favorites in this year's tournament, and the trio doesn't include No. 1 seeds Gonzaga or Kansas. Level playing field? Hold up, wait a minute. What about the purported parity? What about the commentators' common mantra that this is ""anyone's tournament,"" that there are 20 teams who could hang a championship banner from their rafters? Malarkey, said Pomeroy: ""It was a pretty typical year."" Pit your bracket against CNN personalities' It's true there is no one dominant team, as there was last year when Kentucky (which sent six players to the NBA) winning it all seemed a foregone conclusion, he said. This year's tournament still has its favorites, however. ""The numbers say Louisville, Indiana and Florida are better than (Gonzaga) right now,"" he said. The Zags come in at No. 4 in Pomeroy's rankings, but he is quick to say his ""ratings represent a team's average performance, and teams rarely put in an average performance."" Plus, history dictates averages don't mean much when young, hungry ballers take the court to compete for the college hoops crown. A bad matchup can sink a clear favorite, as can lights-out three-point shooting or a burst of suffocating defense. Put simply, Pomeroy said, ""The tournament is wacky."" Butler and Virginia Commonwealth proved that two years ago when they upended everyone's brackets by charging into the Final Four. So, why couldn't it happen for the Zags? They've made 15 straight tournaments since 1999, an active streak topped only by powerhouses Kansas (24), Duke (18) and Michigan State (16). In that span, they've made it to the Sweet 16 four times and the Elite Eight once. Gonzaga also hasn't lost since January 19 -- to then-13th-ranked Butler -- and while they played only three ranked teams, they didn't slouch during nonconference play, picking up opponents from the Big Ten, Big 12 and ACC. Doubting Thomases . Where, then, is the love? How can it be that only 5.6% of ESPN's millions of Tournament Challenge participants have the Zags finishing on top? Why can you tune in to the ""The Tony Kornheiser Show"" and hear the host repeatedly refer to Gonzaga not as the Bulldogs, but as the ""choking dogs""? (Kornheiser actually used the word ""chokingest"" during Tuesday's show.) Why does Las Vegas put Gonzaga's odds at 12 to 1 to win it all? Why do those same bookies give Gonzaga and Ohio State, the No. 2 seed in the West, near-similar odds of winning the region? Could it be that in a year when commentators are harping about parity -- a year when schools like LaSalle and St. Mary's get at-large nods over defending champion Kentucky -- Gonzaga is just overhyped? ""It's easy to come to the conclusion that smaller schools are getting in this year,"" said Michael Litos, author of ""Cinderella: The Rise of the Mid-Major,"" but he disagrees. The Zags ""ran through their conference, have some big nonconference wins and they got the No. 1 seed,"" he said. ""It's nothing to do with being a mid-major. They won 31 ball games, and they earned it on the court."" Litos, who also does radio color commentary for Virginia Commonwealth basketball games, said he feels the term mid-major is ""hollow and shallow and fairly irrelevant these days."" Gonzaga's sustained success has allowed the school to spread its wings in recruiting, attracting prospects from as far away as Tennessee, Minnesota, Canada, Germany and Poland -- a geographic reach similar to that of the Indiana Hoosiers. The Zags pay their head coach of 15 years, Mark Few, more than $1 million, putting him just behind the coaches at historically solid basketball schools like Cincinnati and North Carolina State. Consider also that Gonzaga's basketball expenses have risen from $1.9 million in 2005 to $6.1 million last year, according to the U.S. Department of Education, which means better facilities and players. That doesn't keep them in the company of Duke ($15.9 million) and Louisville ($15.5 million), but it does put them ahead of Miami ($5.8 million) and Ohio State ($6 million). 'A whole lot of ingredients' When you combine these factors -- money, recruits, nonconference schedule, years of success -- it's tough to call a team like Gonzaga a mid-major, even if they do hail from the West Coast Conference, Litos said. Still, there's some prejudice, he said. ""When people get into their office, close the door and stare down at that piece of paper, they see Louisville, Duke, Kansas,"" Litos said, explaining that those teams' histories have more sway than they should. ""History doesn't matter. All that matters is what this team can do,"" he said. ""But we use that to shape our mindset, and that is part of that mid-major bias. It's similar to why the pundits aren't picking the Zags to go to the Final Four."" Asked where they had the Zags in their own brackets, Litos said he had them losing in the Elite Eight to Ohio State, and Pomeroy said he doesn't do brackets; he just likes to watch basketball. The consummate statistician, Pomeroy noted that the odds were against the Zags winning, but that holds true for any team. On average, No. 1 seeds win only three games in the tourney. You need six for the trophy. But Gonzaga has ""a whole lot of ingredients that go into postseason success,"" Litos said. They have an experienced backcourt, they rebound well, they're athletic and can run the floor. Their three-point shooting is decent at 37.1%, but their team 50.4% shooting places them second among tournament teams. Their 77.6 points a game is 12th-best in college hoops. Add to that the consistency that comes with Coach Few. ""If you need a sailboat to be guided through a storm, you want the best doggone captain out there, and that's Mark Few,"" Litos said. Few's ability to adapt to situations and coach his players in the style he's crafted over 15 years gives Gonzaga the ""steady guiding hand"" that any team -- big or small -- needs in the tournament, Litos said. Underdog? Ha, bring it . Spokane Councilman Ben Stuckart, a second-generation Gonzaga alum whose parents had season tickets in the John Stockton days (1980-1984, when the Hall of Famer played guard), said the team also has moxie. ""They're a special team. When they get their backs up against the wall, they push though,"" he said, pointing to the Oklahoma State game when a final-minute Gary Bell three-pointer helped Gonzaga topple the No. 22 Cowboys. When the Zags take the floor at Salt Lake City's EnergySolutions Arena on Thursday, Stuckart expects his birthplace to be a ""dead town."" Everyone will be watching Gonzaga-Southern, he said. Spokane is abuzz with Gonzaga's success. ""Go Zags"" and ""Love Our Zags"" signs adorn homes, yards, storefronts and car windows. During a city meeting on Tuesday, no business was addressed for 20 minutes because everyone wanted to talk Zags basketball, Stuckart said. As for the ""no-respect"" talk, Stuckart brushes it off. The second-smallest city to host the World's Fair, Spokane welcomes underdog status, and you won't hear from residents any ""indignation about not getting respect,"" Stuckart said. ""We're just happy to be from Spokane."" Since the 1999 run to the Elite Eight, Gonzaga ""has been central to our identity as a city,"" he said, and it's been common in years past for people to have high hopes, idealistically jotting down Gonzaga as a Final Four team in their brackets. ""But this year, people are picking them to go all the way,"" Stuckart said. ""We're ranked No. 1 in the polls. The next step is the Final Four, right?"" Said Litos, ""Lord forbid they win it all. Then, party on.""","Gonzaga have NCAA-best 31-2 record; Las Vegas puts championship odds at 12-1 .

"(CNN) -- World No. 2 Rafael Nadal remains on course for a semifinal showdown with Andy Murray at the French Open after both progressed into the last eight on Monday. Nadal, seeking a record seventh title at Roland Garros, set up a clash with fellow Spaniard Nicolas Almagro after posting his fourth successive straight-sets victory of the clay-court event. Having celebrated his 26th birthday on Sunday, Nadal demolished Argentine 13th seed Juan Monaco 6-2 6-0 6-0 to send a real message of intent to his main rivals. He won 17 games in a row to take his overall record at the tournament to 49-1. ""In my opinion, he was unlucky in the first set. That's my feeling, 6-2 was too much. Later, for sure I was very happy the way I played. I feel very, very sorry for him,"" Nadal said.

"Caracas, Venezuela (CNN) -- Venezuelan investigators have detained 12 police officials following the shooting death of a Chilean diplomat's teenage daughter. Karen Berendique, 19, died Saturday from gunshot wounds after Venezuelan police shot at the vehicle she was riding in with her brother in the coastal city of Maracaibo, officials said. Her father, Chilean Honorary Consul Fernando Berendique, told reporters that police pointed guns at the car and opened fire when it didn't stop at a checkpoint. The car had six bullet holes in it, he said. ""It is a product of the irresponsibility and a product of the disrespect for human life here, an act of officials that had little experience, and this is the consequence. ...

"(CNN) -- An Australian government commission delivered a stunning blow to the sports-obsessed nation's self-image, alleging that many professional athletes are using forbidden drugs often supplied by organized crime groups. The Australian Crime Commission said Thursday that a yearlong investigation found evidence suggesting ""widespread use"" of prohibited substances and illicit drugs, some of them unapproved for human use, in a number of professional sports. ""The findings are shocking, and they'll disgust Australian sports fans,"" Justice Minister Jason Clare said at a news conference Thursday. Scientists, coaches and other staff have facilitated the use of the ""performance and image enhancing drugs,"" which organized crime entities are involved in distributing, the commission said in a report detailing its disturbing conclusions over more than 40 pages. The revelations are especially devastating for a nation where sports such as rugby, cricket and Australian football underpin identity and culture. ""An understanding of sport is central to an understanding of Australian culture and Australians' sense of who they are in the world,"" according to the University of Sydney. ""Australia's biggest cultural events are sporting events."" A grim start to 2013 for international sports . The scandal follows a bleak few weeks for professional sports worldwide. Last month, U.S. cyclist Lance Armstrong admitted to the use of performance enhancing drugs and blood doping during his multiple Tour de France victories. And on Monday, European police officials said they were investigating hundreds of top soccer games over suspicions of match-fixing involving international crime syndicates. The Australian commission's report didn't specify which sports are the focus of the doping allegations, citing legal restrictions. But it said that the current official doping statistics don't reflect the scale of the problem. Clare said evidence suggests that the drug use doesn't concern the ""majority"" of sports professionals, but that ""we're talking about multiple athletes across a number of codes."" In some cases, sports scientists and other staff are suspected of ""orchestrating the doping of entire teams,"" he said. Concerns over organized crime . The role of organized crime in the trade of the illicit substances, which include peptides and hormones, has caused particular concern. ""It's cheating, but it's worse than that,"" Clare said. ""It's cheating with the help of criminals."" Criminal groups are taking advantage of legal loopholes under which the supply of certain substances prohibited by sporting authorities isn't classed as a crime even though the athletes who use the drugs face heavy bans, the commission says. ""Professional sport in Australia is highly vulnerable to organized criminal infiltration through legitimate business relationships with sports franchises and other associations,"" the report said. ""There is also increasing evidence of personal relationships of concern between professional athletes and organized criminal identities and groups,"" it added. These connections ""may have resulted in match fixing and the fraudulent manipulation of betting markets,"" according to the Australian government. 'The blackest day' The government said it was responding by giving the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority increased powers and resources to investigate the issues. It also said that if ""persons of interest"" refuse to cooperate with the authority's investigations, they could face civil penalties. ""Don't underestimate how much we know,"" Clare said. ""If you are involved in this, come forward before you get a knock at the door."" He added that as a result of the commission's report, authorities believe ""multiple potential criminal offenses have been committed,"" and the relevant information has been passed onto police. The catalog of problems exposed by the commission's report prompted expressions of dismay and disgust in Australia. Richard Ings, a former head of the anti-doping authority, summed up the mood. ''This is not a black day in Australian sport, this is the blackest day in Australian sport,"" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. In an interview with CNN, Ings called the report a ""wake-up call"" for sports and suggested that other countries should take a look at their own sports programs to check for doping and corruption. ""What is happening here and what has been uncovered here could easily happen in any other jurisdiction and any other country around the world,"" he said. Many prohibited substances in use nowadays cannot be detected by existing drug testing programs, according to Ings. ""The game has changed,"" he said.

"Homs, Syria (CNN) -- A freelance cameraman who visited Homs recently put together a video that provides a rare glimpse of life in the embattled city and an even rarer close-up of the opposition movement in Syria. At the headquarters of the government secret police, the cameraman -- who uses the name Mani to avoid retribution by the government if he returns -- finds himself in the thick of a battle. Some 200 members of the Free Syrian Army, made of military defectors, are involved in the attack. They explode a bomb below a rooftop position, where government snipers are trapped. In the video, portions of which CNN aired Friday, the opposition appears organized, their members communicating by walkie-talkie and engaging in fierce fighting. Casualties are taken via minibus to a makeshift field hospital, where they are placed on thin mats on the floor. ""My eye! My eye!"" shouts one man whose eye had been targeted by a bullet. Mani's camera follows opposition fighters as they enter the government building, where room-to-room and stairwell-to-stairwell fighting ensues. Finally, as bullets continue to fly, the opposition fighters make off with boxes of ammunition so they can return to fight another day. After 20 hours, 15 opposition fighters have been killed, 40 wounded. The next day, the building is gutted by local residents. Not all the battles are so bloody. Mani says they are sometimes able to persuade government forces to cede ground without firing a shot. ""They always try, first, to make negotiations work,"" Mani says. ""They talk with the officer, they talk with the soldiers, and they offer them either to defect, either to surrender, and leave the checkpoint. And sometimes it works."" Civilian volunteers are plentiful; more and more, they are being joined by defectors from government forces, Mani says. Across Homs, some estimates put the FSA strength at more than 1,000. Each neighborhood has its own command, but they sometimes combine forces to improve their odds against the much larger and better-armed government forces. Some soldiers who don't desert nevertheless sell their weapons or ammunition to the opposition, the cameraman adds. ""There are many people who are in favor of them, who feel they are in favor of the opposition,"" Mani says. Down one street, his camera shows a long line of residents lined up outside a bakery for bread. ""Because of the snipers, people are taking more than they need,"" says the man who is handing out the loaves. ""That's why it's crowded."" Two days earlier, in a nearby district, hundreds of residents fill the streets to mourn the deaths of 138 people in overnight shelling by government forces. Without enough coffins to go around, many of the dead are wrapped in white shrouds. ""Shelling people is what cowards and scoundrels do,"" the imam says. ""Be careful of gathering in public."" ""We are going to heaven!"" the crowd chants, their fists pumping the air. ""There are millions of us!"" Mani comes upon a woman just as she learns that her son has been fatally shot by a sniper. ""He is my son! My rock!"" she wails. ""I have no man! He is my man!"" Her son, a former supporter of the regime, bears a tattoo on his chest that says ""Assad."" Next to that is the entry point for the bullet. A couple of blocks away, the shelling that has pockmarked much of the city has spared a district where many residents belong to the Alawite sect to which President Bashar al-Assad belongs. Homs is now a patchwork divided along sectarian lines. CNN's Nic Robertson contributed to this report.","Cameraman gives a rare glimpse of fighting in the city of Homs .

"(CNN) -- Desperation and a rapidly growing death toll serve as a backdrop for a new effort dozens of countries are launching in hopes of finally stemming the brutal crackdown under way in Syria. At a meeting Friday in Tunisia, world leaders will look to mount pressure against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The meeting of the ""Friends of Syria"" group is ""part of our ongoing efforts with our friends, allies, and the Syrian opposition to crystallize next steps to halt the slaughter of the Syrian people and pursue a transition to democracy in Syria,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said. More than 70 countries have been invited. Russia, which recently vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution aimed at stopping the violence in Syria, is not taking part. Saudi King Abdullah spoke about Syria during a phone call Wednesday with Dmitriy Medvedev, telling the Russian president that any dialogue would not work, according to the official Saudi press agency SPA. And Lebanese Foreign Minister Adnan Mansour said Lebanon would not participate in the Friends of Syria conference, according to the official news agency NNA. China, which also vetoed the resolution, has not announced a decision. ""If, in fact, China chooses to accept the invitation, that will certainly be a positive sign of its willingness to work with the rest of us to try to end the violence,"" Nuland said. The meeting's location is significant because it was in Tunisia last year that the uprisings that became known as the ""Arab Spring"" began. ""The failure to get a U.N. Security Council resolution, blame for that rests on two countries,"" State Department spokesman Mark Toner told reporters Wednesday. ""So the international community is fairly united in trying to help the people of Syria. The question is, what do we do? ""We talked about humanitarian assistance and trying to work those avenues, cease-fires, we need to get the Syrian regime to stop the onslaught of Homs. These are immediate goals and immediate objectives as we head into Tunis."" The death toll in Syria is edging toward 9,000, according to the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria (LCC). On Thursday morning, two people had been reported killed, according to the group, which identified one of them as an army recruit who was shot dead after refusing to open fire on on demonstrators in Zabadany and the other as an 8-year-old boy from Aleppo. Sixty people were killed Wednesday including two journalists -- one American, one French -- according to the LCC. The deaths included 20 in the Baba Amr neighborhood of Homs, 13 in Hama, 22 in Idlib, one in Daraa, two in Aleppo, and two in Damascus suburbs. Journalists' deaths highlight dangers . YouTube videos corroborated by activists' accounts showed hundreds of students at the University of Aleppo marching to the campus center -- Clock Square -- and taking down the Baath party's flag, then raising the pro-democracy flag, referred to by activists as the ""independence flag."" It was used by the Syrian republic before Hafez al-Assad took power in 1971. Shortly after that, security forces and pro-government supporters opened fire to disperse the protesters, the activists said. Protests in Aleppo are significant because the city's population, along with areas in Damascus, represent the upper-middle class who traditionally have benefited from the al-Assad regime. In Damascus, security forces closed entrances and exits and then arrested more than 800 civilians at the Hal Market in the middle of the capital city, activists said. The forces then launched a campaign during which shop owners and laborers from Daraa and Idlib provinces were targeted, the activists said. About 500 soldiers defected from the Syrian army's 17th Regiment and joined the opposition Free Syrian Army, forming a brigade in Idlib, opposition leader Mohamad al-Sayed told CNN. Some of the worst violence Wednesday was in the besieged city of Homs, where many residents have been unable to move and have been without critical supplies for weeks. U.N. officials have said updating a death toll is nearly impossible given current conditions. ""This level of brutality is something that I haven't ever seen in my life,"" activist Wissam Tarif told CNN Wednesday. He is in Beirut, in contact with many in Syria. There is an urgent need for ambulances to be allowed into stricken areas, he said. Particularly in Baba Amr, many wounded people were being denied access to medical care, he said. The two Western journalists were killed in Homs amid heavy shelling from government forces. The Sunday Times of London said one of the journalists was reporter Marie Colvin, the only British newspaper journalist inside Baba Amr. Read Marie Colvin's final report for the Sunday Times . French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said journalist Remi Ochlik was killed in a bombing. Syrian state TV showed a banner Wednesday saying the ministry of information had no knowledge of the presence of the journalists, and it requested that officials in Homs look for them. The Syrian regime has severely limited access to the country by foreign journalists, making it impossible to verify many opposition or government reports. But some journalists have managed to get into Syria without the government's knowledge. The night before, Colvin was on air with CNN describing the onslaught in Homs. ""The Syrian army is shelling the city of cold, starving civilians,"" she said. Colvin, a veteran correspondent who also covered last year's Libyan civil war, said the Syrian crisis was the worst conflict she had covered, partly because of the volume of ammunition and shelling falling on Homs. ""There's a lot of snipers on the high buildings surrounding the Baba Amr neighborhood. You can sort of figure out where a sniper is, but you can't figure out where a shell is going to land,"" she said. The deaths Wednesday followed that of New York Times reporter Anthony Shadid, who was reporting in eastern Syria when he died last week, apparently from an asthma attack, the newspaper said. Opinion: The world owes a debt to slain journalists . Syria routinely blames the violence on ""armed terrorist groups."" The state-run news agency SANA said Wednesday that ""competent authorities"" had killed three members of such a group Monday and arrested five in Idlib. Also, a group assassinated an engineer and wounded his 16-year-old son in Hama, the SANA report said. Five members of the army and law enforcement were buried Wednesday, SANA said. The vast majority of accounts from inside Syria indicate al-Assad's forces are slaughtering civilians in an attempt to wipe out opposition members, who are demanding his ouster and democratic reforms. Colvin, interviewed hours before her death, described the heartbreak of watching a boy die after being struck in the chest by shrapnel -- one of the many children killed in the conflict. She said it was important to share his story and images. ""That little baby is one of two children who died today,"" Colvin said. ""That baby probably will move more people to think, what is going on, and why is no one stopping this murder in Homs that is happening every day?"" CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali, Arwa Damon, Holly Yan, Josh Levs, Joe Sterling, Yousuf Basil and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","""The question is, what do we do?"" says State Department spokesman .

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- The Syrian government blamed last Friday's rebel attack on an electric power station in downtown Damascus on ""armed terrorist gangs"" -- the same epithet it has used to describe the protest movement that erupted in the southern border city of Daraa more than a year ago. But the gunfire and explosions that echoed across the Syrian capital in recent days have underscored a turning point of sorts. The clashes shattered the notion that Damascus exists in a security bubble. Helicopters said to fire indiscriminately . Syria experts say the battle for Syria's two largest cities -- Damascus and the country's economic capital, Aleppo -- has begun. ""In both places we've seen not just more armed clashes than ever in the past, but also a revival of the protest movement in its peaceful dimension,"" said Peter Harling, a Damascus-based analyst with the conflict-resolution organization International Crisis Group. ""What has changed is the conflict has moved into areas that the regime claimed was being dominated by the silent majority, which wanted stability, not regime change,"" Harling added. That facade has been shattered in recent weeks, not by bullet or bombs, but through padlocks and keys. On Monday, May 28, row after row of shops and stalls in the cavernous Hamidiya Bazaar in the heart of Damascus were shuttered. Shopkeepers across the capital staged a general strike to protest against the suspected massacre of civilians in the village of Houla -- allegedly by pro-government militia. ""When the merchants of Hamidiya -- the main souq (marketplace) -- go on strike, you know you have lost the conscience and heart of Damascus,"" wrote Joshua Landis, a Syria expert and director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma. ""The Sunni bourgeoisie has now turned on the regime.."" ""This is really a very strong signal suggesting that the historical alliance between the regime and the business establishment in the capital is at least partially broken,"" added ICG's Harling. Harling pointed out that even during the height of the bloody Syrian government crackdown against the Muslim Brotherhood in 1982, Hafez al Assad, the father of the current Syrian president, succeeded in preventing Damascus merchants from staging strikes. Several days after last month's market strike in Damascus, however, shopkeepers in several Aleppo commercial districts mounted a similar but smaller protest. ""I didn't open my shop. All the Aleppo suburbs are on strike today (after) what happened in Houla,"" an Aleppo shopkeeper who asked only to be named Abu Karim, said in a phone interview with CNN. ""We carry the responsibility for continuing to work while people are dying,"" Abu Karim added. ""That is our shame."" In some cases, Syrian security forces lashed out at the silent commercial protest. One activist video showed men in camouflage uniforms using bolt cutters to force open the metal shutters of locked shops on a Damascus street. The violence roiling the country, combined with sanctions imposed by Western governments, has contributed to economic hardship faced by ordinary Syrians. More than a dozen residents of Damascus and Aleppo interviewed by CNN complained of daily power outages and rising prices of commodities including sugar and cooking fuel. ""They cut the electricity for two hours every morning, and of course it affects work a lot, because the whole company runs on computers,"" said the CEO of a Damascus-based media company, speaking to CNN on condition of anonymity for fear of his life. He said he had assigned one of his employees the task of purchasing diesel to run backup generators, but added that this was complicated by the recent spike in the price of fuel. ""With the economic sanctions on the country, it is difficult for us to continue providing services because money transactions cannot get through to us from our [foreign] clients,"" the CEO said. ""Due to power outages, all the perishable food stocks in my refrigerators and freezers were ruined,"" said Usama, a Damascus shopkeeper who asked only to be identified by his first name to protect himself from reprisal. Usama told CNN he finally decided to shut down his business. ""What's the point of having a shop when nobody buys from you and people have no money to spend, and when they do they only spend it on the most basic needs?"" he asked. As economic conditions have worsened, the security presence in the two main cities has ramped up dramatically. A recent opposition video showed military trucks and hundreds of soldiers dressed in camouflage using the main sports stadium in Damascus as an apparent staging ground. ""It's so different than when I was here six months ago,"" reported Deborah Amos, a correspondent for U.S. National Public Radio, in a broadcast from Damascus on Saturday. ""This was an alive city. People were out at night. They were in the cafes and in the restaurants. (Now) at night, the people go home and it's time for the army to take over."" Analysts argue that President Bashar al-Assad's regime's decision to use overwhelming military force to try to crush opposition in second-tier cities like Homs has only spread the tentacles of the insurgency into cities that were once bastions of government support. Al-Assad defined by indecision, violence . ""The regime has been sowing dragon's teeth,"" wrote Joshua Landis of the University of Oklahoma. ""For every opponent of the regime killed, several more pop up to take its place."" ""What we see is a regime whose narrative boiled down to 'us or chaos.' But increasingly what we see is 'them and chaos,"" said Harling of the International Crisis Group. ""The regime has been incapable of imposing law and order."" The Syrian regime is still far from defeated. It has fervent supporters and vastly better weapons than the rebels. But the image it successfully projected throughout much of the first 15 months of the uprising -- that of a government in control -- has begun to crack.","Gunfire echoing across Damascus underscores a turning point of sorts .

"(CNN) -- It's not uncommon for golfers of any level to hole in one, but it's not often that one player does it twice in two days at a top-level tournament. Keith Horne shared the limelight with runaway leader Charl Schwartzel at the European Tour's Alfred Dunhill Championship in their native South Africa on Saturday, landing a repeat ace that earned him an unexpected Christmas present. The 41-year-old will take home a luxury car following his hole-in-one at the par-three 12th at Leopard Creek in the third round. ""Unbelievable. It was the same club, but the wind was different, so I had to hit a full eight iron this time,"" he told the European Tour website after matching his Friday feat at the same hole. ""It was in all the way -- never looked like missing. Went in a bit faster this time, so I didn't get to admire it as much as yesterday, but it really got the adrenaline going much more."" Under competition rules, it would not have earned him a prize as the car is only on offer for holes-in-one on the final day, but sponsor BMW made an exception. ""I'm really chuffed. It was very kind of them to recognize that two holes-in-one were worthy of giving me the car,"" said Horne, who is still waiting for his first European Tour victory. ""I wasn't expecting it, so I'm over the moon. This was an unbelievable Christmas present and I couldn't have asked for a more beautiful car."" The world No. 246 signed for a four-under-par 68 that put him sixth ahead of Sunday's final round -- 12 shots behind 23rd-ranked Schwartzel. Schwartzel won by 11 shots in Thailand last weekend for his first victory since the 2011 Masters, and he is poised for another convincing triumph after shooting 64 to go 10 clear. ""It is a nice comfort, and I'd rather be 10 ahead than nine ahead. Whatever lead you can build is great,"" said the 28-year-old, who won at the same venue eight years ago and has been runner-up there four times. ""We've all see what can happen in this game. I don't want to think about it -- if all goes well I'm going to celebrate."" Schwartzel had shared the halfway lead with Gregory Bourdy, but the Frenchman dropped back to second on 11-under 205 after slumping to a 74. Branden Grace, who won four times on the European Tour last season with the first two coming on home soil in South Africa, was tied for third on 206 with Sweden's Kristoffer Broberg and Englishman Steve Webster. Meanwhile, Europe will take a one-point lead against Asia into Sunday's final round of the Royal Trophy teams event in Brunei. Led by former Ryder Cup captain Jose Maria Olazabal, the Europeans could not repeat Friday's strong opening and lost Saturday's fourball matches 3-1 for an overall 4Â½ -- 3Â½ scoreline. The veteran Spaniard will play in the first of Sunday's deciding singles matches, taking on South Korea's Bae Sang-moon. The eighth and final match will be between Ryder Cup winner Francesco Molinari and veteran Korean Y.E.Yang. ""Francesco Molinari played against Tiger Woods in the final match last time and got an excellent half point, so he was a good choice to go out last again,"" said Olazabal, referring to September's incredible final-day comeback against the U.S. at Medinah.","South African veteran earns luxury car after holing second hole in one of tournament .

"(CNN) -- A top defector from the Syrian military said Saturday that armed rebel groups have aligned under the leadership of the Free Syrian Army. Uniting all efforts will bolster the anti-regime movement and safeguard the nation, Brig. Gen. Mustafa Sheikh said in a video posted on YouTube. The move addressed a key concern for observers of the Syrian crisis both inside and outside the country -- that armed rebel groups were disjointed and divided. Sheikh was one of the first high-ranking officers to announce his defection from President Bashar al-Assad's forces. He was accompanied in the video by Free Syrian Army commander Col. Riad al-Asaad. ""In these critical and difficult times that our beloved country is going through, all the honorable men and women in this nation are required to work on uniting all efforts to overthrow this corrupt regime,"" Sheikh said. ""The soldiers and officers of the Free Syrian Army pledged their allegiance to protect the people and the nation."" Not long after the video was posted, fresh attacks by the regime killed at least 54 people across the country, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. Of the dead, 25 were in the war-torn city of Homs, rife with anti-government sentiment. Syria's state-run news agency said funeral processions were held for 18 members of the military and police. It blamed their deaths on armed terrorist groups. CNN cannot independently confirm reports of casualties or attacks in Syria because the government severely restricts access by international journalists. The United Nations estimates the Syrian conflict has killed more than 8,000 people; opposition activists put the toll at more than 10,000. In the YouTube video, Sheikh outlined rebel decisions. ""First, we decided to unite all the military councils and battalions and all the armed battalions inside the country under one unified leadership of the Free Syrian Army and to follow the orders of the commander of the FSA, Col. Riad al-Asaad,"" Sheikh said. Second, with the FSA serving and protecting Syrians, ""any movement to carry out a military operation or do anything outside the framework of the FSA ""will be held responsible for any act they carry out,"" Sheikh warned. Third, the rebels called for soldiers and officers in the Syrian armed forces ""who don't have blood on their hands"" to defect and join the ranks of the FSA. Sheikh's appearance with al-Asaad also mended rifts between the two main defectors' groups, the Free Syrian Army and the Higher Military Council. In February, a spokesman for the Higher Military Council announced Sheikh was the leader of the group, which claimed to lead armed defectors within Syria. But al-Asaad, who was leading the FSA from the Turkish border with Syria, quickly rejected the claim. ""This man represents himself,"" al-Asaad said of Sheikh last month. ""He has nothing to do with the Free Syrian Army. ... Those people are representing themselves and do not represent the revolution and the Free Syrian Army. They don't represent anybody."" ""The division is over. All the parties involved in the revolution carried out all the efforts to form one united front to better represent and defend the Syrian people,"" Free Syrian Army Lt. Riad Ahmed said. ""In the past, there were some minor technical disagreements, but this is all behind us from now on,"" he said. Al-Asaad will lead all field operations of the FSA, while Sheikh will remain head of the Higher Military Council and will represent the FSA in trying to get weapons and international support, Ahmed said. Some world leaders have been hesitant to send arms to the rebels, saying the opposition movement is fractured and that a political solution is still possible. The unification also allows rebels to unilaterally deny attacks carried out by other groups. The Syrian government routinely blames the vaguely defined ""armed terrorist groups"" for violence in the country, while most reports from inside Syria indicate the government is slaughtering civilians in an attempt to wipe out dissidents. Meanwhile, Kofi Annan, the U.N.-Arab League special envoy to Syria, arrived in Moscow on Saturday in an effort to seek Russian help in securing a cease-fire. Annan will also visit Beijing this weekend, his spokesman said. Russia and China have blocked Security Council attempts to pass resolutions condemning the al-Assad regime. The two countries say they want the violence to stop but argue that previous resolutions were not evenhanded. Russia and China have major trade deals with Syria, and again Friday they refused to condemn al-Assad's regime formally by voting against a U.N. Human Rights Council resolution condemning ""appalling human rights violations in Syria."" The resolution passed 41-3, with Cuba casting the other negative vote. The Russian Foreign Ministry called the resolution a ""unilateral assessment"" of the crisis --blaming solely the regime for the violence. Human Rights Watch, however, lashed out at the Russian ministry's use of an open letter published by the global monitoring group that described atrocities committed by armed groups affiliated with the Syrian opposition. The organization said it had learned that Russian diplomats used the open letter in informal U.N. Security Council discussions March 22 in an attempt to equate the violence by both sides. ""Russia's attention to concerns expressed in the letter to the Syrian opposition is a positive development,"" Human Rights Watch said. ""The selective use of the findings, however, causes serious concern."" It said Russia had ignored detailed documentation of widespread and systematic abuses by the al-Assad regime, including killings of peaceful protesters, shelling of residential neighborhoods, large-scale arbitrary detention and torture, executions, denial of medical assistance, looting, and ""disappearances."" ""None of these findings have been ever acknowledged by Russian officials,"" the group said. The U.N. Security Council this week urged immediate implementation of Annan's proposed peace plan. The 15-member body, including China and Russia, expressed full support for Annan's efforts. CNN's Brianna Keilar, Arwa Damon, Ivan Watson and journalist Omar al Muqdad contributed to this report.","At least 54 people are killed Saturday, activists say .

"(CNN) -- A Syrian Cabinet minister confirmed the death of his rebel son, and, without a trace of grief, coldly rejected the young man's embrace of the opposition, according to a state news report. ""I disapprove and condemn whatever my son did,"" said Mohammad Turki al-Sayyed, minister of state for the People's Assembly Affairs, who acknowledged the death of his son, Bassim. ""I said it before and I disavow him again, fully even after his death."" Al-Sayyed's statement, reported by the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency, illustrates the collapse of Syrian family stability during the 22-month old conflict, now a full-blown civil war. The United Nations says more than 60,000 people have died in the carnage, which shows no signs of stopping. As for Bassim al-Sayyed, one activist wrote on his Facebook page that he joined demonstrators at the start of the uprising in 2011. He later joined the Free Syrian Army and was killed in the fighting. Mourners at his December 30 funeral shouted his praises and chanted ""God is mightier than any tyrant,"" according to videos posted on an opposition Facebook page. The videos said Bassim was killed in a battle for the police institute of Sarmada, a northern city, ""fighting the government forces of his father, the minister."" ""We will never kneel down, never surrender,"" one man chanted. But the minister said Bassim ""joined the ranks of the terrorists who wanted to tear down the country"" because he was ""brainwashed by Syria's enemies."" He repeated his assertion that media outlets and entities across the globe are plotting against President Bashar al-Assad's government . ""The homeland is above everyone and when it comes to Syria, all the titles, relations and even the personal emotions mean nothing when it comes to the nation,"" Mohammad Turki al-Sayyed said. ""When it comes to choosing between terrorism and the homeland, the minister always chose the homeland and disavowing himself from everyone who wants to stir evil in the nation even if it was his own son."" Unrest at rain-soaked refugee camp . Across the border in Jordan, Syrian refugees at a camp became restive as heavy rains pounded their living quarters and created havoc. Some reports said there were riots at the Zaatari camp. U.N. senior field coordinator Marin Kajdomcaj wouldn't say it was a riot, but he confirmed an ""expression of discontent."" Water, sand and dust have seeped into the tents, and camp residents need supplies, such as blankets and medicine. ""We have been moving refugees from tents to prefabricated homes,"" Kajdomcaj said of the 45,000-strong camp. ""It is a situation where large numbers of refugees are coming every night to Zaatari. Last night we had 1,000 plus. There is a pressure of new arrivals coupled with limited resources. We have to quickly find a solution. It is not an easy situation. It is a very delicate situation burdened by the weather,"" he said. UNICEF last week issued a report about the impact of winter on children at the refugee camps. An article about Zaatari said, ""the cold is making life increasingly miserable."" It cited health problems such as diarrhea and dehydration, a lack of hot water for bathing, and a need for winter clothes, blankets and better food. The number of Syrians registered or awaiting registration as refugees in Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Egypt has surpassed 540,000, about half of them children, the United Nations said. The number could exceed one million later this year, the agency said. SANA reported rain in most Syrian provinces and said snow covered mountain peaks. Battle for air base . In the Taftanaz area of northern Syria, a fierce battle for a key Syrian air base is heating up, dissidents say, as rebels reportedly downed a government helicopter . Rebels ""shot down a regime chopper above Taftanaz military airport, and explosions can be heard from inside the base,"" the Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. Another opposition group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said the chopper was shot down over a village near Taftanaz. CNN cannot independently confirm the claims. For months, rebels have tried to gain control of the air base in Syria's northwestern Idlib province. Al-Nusra Front, a militant group that the United States has designated as a terrorist movement, is among three rebel factions attacking the base, rebels said in a statement. The number of people slain in Syria on Tuesday stood at 124, including 47 in Idlib and 35 in Damascus and its suburbs, the LCC said.","NEW: More than 120 deaths reported Tuesday by the opposition .

"(CNN) -- Perhaps it is fate -- or is it destiny? Jose Mourinho has been writing his own scripts for years, but the latest episode in the journey of the ""Special One"" could be something of a blockbuster. Take a moment and picture the scene. The Wembley arch, the trophy he considers his own, the city in which it so painfully eluded him and perhaps most importantly, the team which still mocks him by calling him 'the translator'. Wembley -- Champions League final -- London -- Real Madrid versus Barcelona. It's a cast of which Steven Spielberg would be proud. It has all the makings of a classic, but can the man who has already won Europe's greatest prize with Porto and Inter Milan repeat the feat? With his silver hair glistening beneath the floodlights, his hands in his pockets and that film star stare, Mourinho watched on as his Real Madrid side dismissed Turkish side Galatasaray 3-0 in the first leg of its Champions League quarterfinal Wednesday. Only a miracle in Istanbul, something of Liverpool proportions, will now see Galatasaray prevent Mourinho in his quest to become the first man to win Europe's greatest prize with three different clubs. And how sweet the triumph should the Portuguese coach end his time at the Bernabeu by delivering the Holy Grail known as ""La Decima"". Yes, the tenth European Cup is the one Real so badly craves and for Mourinho, it would provide the perfect parting gift at the end of a season where he is widely expected to take his leave. Embroiled in a spat with the Spanish press, rumors of a split in the squad and his team 13 points off arch rival Barcelona at the top of La Liga, this has been a turbulent year for Mourinho. But this is a man who thrives under pressure, the man who enjoys employing the siege mentality, which he so famously instilled in his Chelsea side. That he never managed to win the Champions League while in west London will remain a blot on his otherwise flawless copy book. But with Mourinho expected to leave Real in the summer and Chelsea set to appoint a new manager at the end of the season, there are questions as to whether his return to London may extend beyond the 2013 Champions League final. Another Champions League triumph would make him almost irresistible -- even to Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich. Not since 2002 has Real ruled Europe and while Barcelona and Bayern Munich remains its biggest rivals, the Mourinho factor can not be easily discounted. What is for certain is that there will be more testing nights ahead for this Real team with a place in the semifinals all but assured. Just nine minutes had elapsed when Mesut Ozil's sumptuous through ball released Cristiano Ronaldo, who calmly fired home his ninth goal of the competition and 45th of the season. That strike might have dented the confidence of some teams, but Galatasaray refused to bow and instead threatened to respond almost immediately. Didier Drogba, the man who inspired Chelsea to Champions League success last season, curled just wide from the edge of the penalty area as the Turkish side threatened an equalizer. Uninhibited by the surroundings of the Santiago Bernabeu and the presence of Ronaldo, Galatasaray appeared determined to take the game to its host. But while its intention was honorable, the naivety was plain for all to see as Real used its pace and power to counter at every opportunity. Karim Benzema plundered a second on 29 minutes after the visiting defense had failed to clear Michael Essien's right-wing cross. Substitute Gonzalo Higuain added a third after coming on as substitute to all but seal his side's place in the last four with 17 minutes remaining. ""If we score one more goal, they have to score five,"" Mourinho told Sky Sports following the victory. ""The football I saw was very good, I saw a lot of incredible things - but Istanbul is a difficult place to play and they have players with a lot of experience, with great character and personality. ""They will fight hard against us, but we will take it very seriously, its the only way to get through."" In the night's other game, Malaga escaped with a goalless draw at La Rosaleda after holding Borussia Dortmund. The Spanish club, which is making its debut in the Champions League, extended its unbeaten home record in European competition to 14 matches. But it could have been quite different had the Germans not wasted a whole host of chances with Mario Gotze and Robert Lewandowski both failing to convert opportunities. And it was almost punished when Isco's rasping drive forced Dortmund keeper Roman Weidenfeller into an impressive stop. ""It's a positive result because if we score there it will make it difficult for them,"" Malaga winger Joaquin told Canal Plus. ""We have the same chance as they do of going through and we'll try to repeat what we did tonight, playing a serious game and trying to grab the odd goal,"" he added. ""We came up against what we were expecting, which was a great team that plays football very well but we also had our chances. They made us suffer but we were expecting that."" Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp insists he is more than happy with his side's position going into next week's second leg. He told reporters: ""I can live with this 0-0. We did everything well from the first kick to the final whistle but it's a higher level. ""We know what we have to do in the return match.""","Real Madrid cruises to 3-0 win over Galatasaray .

"(CNN) -- The stunning assassinations of several key Syrian leaders and the outbreak of serious combat in Damascus last week momentarily held out the possibility that President Bashar al-Assad's regime will rapidly fall. Many hoped for a cascade of defections, a rise in popular demonstrations and a rebel surge to bring down the government. Those hopes were exaggerated, fueled by a feverish rumor mill, psychological warfare and notoriously unreliable information coming out of Syria. While the regime has been shaken, its military capability stands as demonstrated by its bloody reassertion of control over Damascus. Along with the support of Russia, its determination to survive at any price could draw out the endgame. The assassinations struck at the heart of the security machine that sustains the regime, and they highlight the extent to which political and military tide has long since turned against al-Assad. The assassinations were more of an inflection than a turning point. Diplomatically isolated, financially strapped and increasingly constrained by a wide range of international sanctions, al-Assad's regime has been left with little room to maneuver. It resorts to indiscriminate military force and uses shabiha gangs and propaganda to inflict terror. The government's violence against peaceful protestors and innocent civilians has been manifestly self-defeating. Al-Assad has failed to kill his way to victory. Day by day, through accumulating mistakes, the regime is losing legitimacy and control of Syria and its people. Nonetheless, it's premature to think the end is close. The opposition's progress, reportedly with increasing external funding and training, has put greater pressure on al-Assad's forces. But the opposition's military success has exacerbated the fears of retribution attacks and a reign of chaos should the regime crumble. The much-maligned political efforts of U.N. special envoy Kofi Annan, backed by the United States, were meant to find a political solution that could prevent precisely such a deterioration of the situation on the ground. Now, even if al-Assad's regime collapses, violence may prove difficult to contain given that the country is deeply polarized and awash in weapons. Al-Assad's end could pave the way for an even more intense civil war. Making matters worse, the continuing fragmentation among the Syrian opposition groups raises deep fears about their ability to unite themselves or to establish authority. Few foundations exist for an inclusive and stable political order after al-Assad. The Obama administration was prudent and wise to avoid a direct military intervention in Syria. A legion of pundits deemed an American military role necessary for any progress against al-Assad. Clearly, it was not. Indeed, a limited intervention would likely have strengthened al-Assad's hand at home and abroad. Had the U.S. chosen to carry out airstrikes to enforce a no-fly zone or safe havens, Syria's crisis would likely be no closer to resolution but America would be deeply embroiled. Some have suggested that the U.S. should provide weapons to favored factions among the opposition groups. This, too, is a dangerous idea. There is no reason to believe that these factions would reward the U.S. with loyalty. What the U.S. should do is focus its efforts on maintaining international pressure and sanctions on al-Assad while preparing for a transition. It should disseminate credible information about the regime's atrocities. It should aggressively plan to bring the architects of Syria's well-documented massacres to face international justice. (It is far too late for an amnesty for al-Assad and his top aides, but lower-level officials should be offered a deadline to defect to avoid prosecution.) When al-Assad falls, the Syrian opposition will urgently need to unite Syria and short-circuit the emergence of an insurgency from supporters of the old regime. Preventing reprisal killings, including all groups in the political process, and incorporating public servants who are not implicated in war crimes will be essential. The U.S. should help prepare the Syrian opposition for the challenges of governing a fractured country by facilitating the negotiation for a representative and unified political entity, with a greater role for pragmatic leaders on the inside. It could send a small U.N. stabilization force to Syria to as a monitor. And it will have to persuade the armed insurgency to police its own ranks to avoid sectarian fights. The hopes of a soft landing in Syria have been destroyed by the regime's violence. The U.S. must now try to deal as best it can with the grinding struggle to come. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Marc Lynch.","Last week, key Syrian security leaders were assassinated by Syrian insurgency .

"(CNN) -- Three Michigan children reportedly left alone in their family's apartment died in a fire Monday afternoon, a public safety official said. The fire broke out around 2 p.m. in Kalamazoo, said Brian Uridge, assistant chief of public safety. Two of the children were 3 years old, and the third was 1, Uridge said. ""You could see smoke from blocks away,"" Uridge said. The main floor of the apartment building was engulfed in flames when firefighters arrived, and ""they found three kids who had already perished as a result of the fire,"" he said. The cause of the fire is unknown, he said. The children's parents were at the scene, Uridge said. ""Initially, we have information that the kids were left alone in the apartment, but we can't talk about charges because it's too early in the investigation,"" Uridge said.

"Bekaa Valley, Lebanon (CNN) -- As the Syria conflict further escalates, refugees continue to cross borders to seek safety in Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Egypt. According to the U.N., the number of Syrians who have registered as refugees -- or are being assisted in these countries -- now exceeds 540,000, with an increase of over 140,000 during the past six weeks alone. I recently traveled to eastern Lebanon to work with Mercy Corps and assist the refugees who have fled their homes in Syria. It was a cold, foggy day with a constant downpour of icy rain. When we crossed the mountains into the Bekaa Valley, the rain turned to a wet snow and a hard wind lashed at us the entire day. Lebanon continues to host the largest Syrian refugee community, with over 170,000 refugees -- and they continue to stream across the border. More than 13,000 have arrived in Lebanon over the past several days as the fighting and airstrikes in Syria have intensified. We met tired and scared families getting off trucks after their 24-hour escape from Syria. Mothers told me accounts of hearing explosions and leaving by foot at dusk, saying they couldn't see the scene in the dark to describe it, but they could smell and feel the dust from the explosions. The kids were scared and many were holding back a flood of tears. The freezing, slushy rain made the situation more desperate and urgent. The refugee situation here is different to what we see in most other countries. Almost all the refugees in Lebanon are in host families or self-made tents constructed from scrap materials such as dismantled billboards. The colorful toothpaste and food advertisements that have been turned into shelters make for a strange sight. They are scattered across the country in over 540 locations. There are no official refugee camps like you find in Jordan and Turkey, which makes providing assistance even more challenging. The families are arriving in the snow and bitter cold conditions. They are carrying plastic bags with the few items they could bring with them as they fled the violence in their country. It seems everywhere you look you see refugees standing out in the street, in the mud, with their plastic bags. Most of them have nowhere to go, so we are providing them with temporary shelter in a training center until they can find another place. Syrian refugees face brutal winter with inadequate shelter and food . The majority of the refugees in Lebanon are staying with host families. The refugees often pay rent to the families that allow them to stay, or they offer labor in exchange for lodging. In some cases there are as many as six refugee families staying with one host family. Each refugee family, typically eight people, is crowded into one room that serves as their kitchen, living area, bathroom and sleeping quarters. In the homes where we are working the electricity is out, the roofs are leaking, the wind whips through the flimsy windows and doors, and it is freezing cold. Families huddle together around a small stove, struggling to stay warm at night as the temperature plummets to below -10C in this region. Hala, a 19-year old refugee who fled her home in Syria by foot, now lives with her family in the attic of a host home. Hala told me: ""We are not able to get warm either by day or by night. The walls are always damp and it is freezing."" In one room I visited, there were two families who had just arrived. They were given a storage room to sleep in -- there were no windows, no electricity and just a plastic sheet on the cold, damp cement floor. The mothers were unpacking blankets from grain sacks they had used as suitcases when they fled. The fathers were assembling an oil stove improvised out of a metal barrel. Kids were trying to help their parents. Everyone was silently working in the dark. I could see they had just endured a horrible experience and hadn't even collected their thoughts. They had made it out of Syria, through the battle. They had found shelter for the night -- and that's as far as they were in their mind. When I asked them what was next, they truly did not know. They only hoped they would be provided some humanitarian assistance while they sat out the fighting. Despite these dire conditions, refugee families offered me tea or to share their dinner. Out of politeness, they told me it was OK to not remove my shoes as I walked in to their rooms. This is almost unheard of in this culture but a politeness offered to the guest foreigner. My shoes were muddy and wet from the day and there was no way I could accept their kind offer. Envoy says 2013 could bring 100,000 deaths in Syria . As the Syrian refugee crisis begins its second winter, Lebanese host households are struggling to cope with the burden of increased expenditures, decreased living space, and an ever-increasing need for more food, fuel and basic living necessities. Most communities hosting Syrian refugees are the poorest in Lebanon with very weak economies that cannot support such a large number of guests for a long period of time. The majority of the refugees left their homes initially believing they would soon return. However, as the violence continues, their resources are dwindling or already gone. Refugees who came in the summer months, did not come prepared to endure the harsh winter. Laith, a 14-year old refugee who came to Lebanon two months ago told me: ""The problem is that I only have my summer clothes here. It is so cold now and there is no way to get warm."" Heaters, blankets, warm clothing and heating fuel are some of the most pressing needs for the winter months, in addition to food, shelter and mattresses. In Bekaa Valley, Mercy Corps has distributed hygiene kits, tablets to purify water, buckets and jerry cans to refugees. Mercy Corps will be distributing over 6,000 winter clothes and over 4,000 vouchers for winter clothes in Bekaa this month. Mercy Corps is also providing psychosocial support services to children and adolescents in the region, and has reached over 2,000 beneficiaries to date. The amount of assistance needed here is overwhelming. The United Nations estimates that if fighting in Syria continues the refugee figure could reach 1.1 million by June 2013. Funding is short and is hampering our ability, and our peer humanitarian organizations, to provide the support these refugees so desperately need. At the end of the day, I left with a lump in my throat. We saw many tears and a vacuum of feeling from fathers who knew they had just walked away from every worldly possession they owned -- knowing it was lost to the war. But I can't say I felt desperate or hopeless. I am an optimist and have to be in order to do this job. For more coverage of the Syrian refugee crisis, click here.

"(CNN) -- Days after Barack Obama granted the first television interview with his entire family, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said he regrets thrusting his two young daughters in the media spotlight. ""I think that we got carried away in the moment,"" Obama told NBC Wednesday morning. ""We were having a birthday party and everybody was laughing, and suddenly this thing cropped up, and I didn't catch it quickly enough, and I was surprised by the attention it got."" The comments came five days after the Illinois senator allowed Access Hollywood reporter Maria Menounos an interview with his entire family, including daughters Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7. The television show, which aired the interview Tuesday, billed it as the first interview with the whole Obama family. The interview remained decidedly light -- Malia commented on seeing her mother in People Magazine while Sasha discussed her father's aversion to sweets -- but it was highly played across several news programs, including many on CNN.  Watch: Are Obama's kids off limits? » . In the interview, Malia also said she often gives her dad campaign tips on how to reach out to young people her age. ""You really don't shake kids' hands that much, you shake adult hands,"" she said. ""And I say you just wave and say hi, so I do that kind of stuff."" Appearing on ABC Wednesday morning, Obama said he didn't think it was healthy for his two daughters to be so exposed. ""Particularly given the way it sort of went around the cable stations, I don't think it's healthy, and it's something that we'll be avoiding in the future,"" he said. Speaking with CNN Tuesday, Menounos, the Access Hollywood reporter, said the campaign had reached out to the show for an interview and her only goal was to show the Obama family dynamic. ""No one really expected them to open up so much,"" Menounos said of the daughters. ""You know the campaign and their family were all huddled around and as surprised that the girls took over the interview as I was!"" Stella Foster, an entertainment columnist for the Chicago-Sun Times, said she didn't see anything wrong with the interview. ""It's not like they have the kids on camera all the time. It was like they were just having a good time -- which they need. They deserve that,"" she said. Obama and his wife, Michelle, had successfully shielded his daughters from the media spotlight since the 18 month-and-counting presidential campaign began. The campaign has repeatedly asked photographers and media outlets not to photograph the children or air images of them on the campaign trail. The veil around the children gives their interview a novelty effect, said Matthew Felling, a contributor to the American Journalism Review. ""But at the same time they are trying to have it both ways by saying ... 'Access Hollywood,' you're going to be friendly to us so we'll let you come out,"" he said.

"Rome (CNN) -- Italy's Parliament began casting votes Thursday for a new president to take the place of the incumbent Giorgio Napolitano, whose term expires next month. The election of a new president could be the first step toward solving a political impasse that has gripped Italy since February's general election left a three-way split between the right, the left and a wild-card party. The presidential voting process is open to 1,007 elected representatives: the 630 deputies in the lower house, 315 senators plus four senators-for-life, and 58 regional delegates. The secret ballot is taking place inside the Chamber of Deputies, or lower house of Parliament. Usually the senators vote first, then the deputies, then the regional delegates. They can vote for any citizen over 50 with full civil and political rights. After counting for the first round wrapped up, former trade union leader Franco Marini was in the lead with 521 votes but short of the two-thirds majority, or 672 votes, needed to win the presidency. The center-left coalition led by politician Pier Luigi Bersani and the center-right coalition of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi appeared to be coming together to back Marini. This would indicate a degree of cooperation between the two blocs, which might allow some kind of alliance to be formed. In second place was Stefano Rodota, a former Italian Communist Party lawmaker and law professor, with 240 votes. Former Turin Mayor Sergio Chiamparino received 41 votes. Berlusconi's ex-wife, Veronica lario, received one vote, despite expressing no desire to be president. According to the Italian Constitution, a two-thirds majority of the electors is needed in the first three rounds of voting. From the fourth session onward, the bar is lowered to an absolute majority, equal to 504 votes. A second round of voting will take place later Thursday. Napolitano's seven-year term expires on May 15. While the Italian presidency is largely a ceremonial role, it can become a critical one in times of political crisis. The issue has been that, under the constitution, the Italian president cannot dissolve Parliament and call for new elections in the last six months of his mandate. The election of a new president could help move Italy out of its current political gridlock. Bersani fared the best in the February elections by leading a leftist coalition dominated by his Democratic Party to a small majority in the lower house of Parliament, but has been unable to form a government. Power in the Senate, where it counts, was divided between Bersani and Berlusconi's center-right coalition, anchored by his party, Popolo della Liberta, or People of Freedom. Bersani and Berlusconi are archrivals who have previously indicated they will not work together. The wild-card party of Beppe Grillo, the grass-roots Five-Star Movement, will also not enter into an alliance. CNN's Hada Messia and Ben Wedeman reported from Rome, and Laura Smith-Spark reported and wrote from London.","NEW: Center-left, center-right appear to be backing the same candidate: Franco Marini .

"(CNN) -- Assailants terrorized residents of a southwestern Pakistani city Sunday with a deadly suicide bombing that targeted police followed by rocket attacks. The bloodshed came a day after national elections marred by violence. At least five people died and 68 more were injured when a suicide bomber rammed a vehicle laden with explosives into the convoy of a ranking police official in the city of Quetta, police said. ""The blast was so loud it was heard all over the city,"" police spokesman Syed Ahmed Mobeen said. The strength of explosion smashed the windows of nearby homes and offices. The apparent target of the bombing, Balochistan provincial Police Chief Mushtaq Ahmed Sukhera, survived the attack unharmed, Mobeen said. Among the dead are policemen, paramilitary soldiers and at least one civilian. Twelve of the wounded were policemen escorting Sukhera. The suicide attack was followed by six rocket attacks in Quetta, Mobeen said. The assault sparked panic among residents. Police do not yet know who is behind the attacks, and no group immediately claimed responsibility. Saturday's voting across Pakistan saw bursts of deadly violence aimed at polling stations, but it failed to deter citizens eager to have their say in landmark national and provincial elections. Voter turnout was nearly 60%, the chief election commissioner said early Sunday. Many were voting for the first time. The national election marked the first transition between civilian governments in the nation's 66-year history.","A suicide bomber rams a police convoy in Quetta with an explosive-laden vehicle .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- A bomb exploded on Thursday night in a popular coffee shop in western Baghdad, killing at least 27 people and wounding 51 others, city police officials said. The bomb was hidden in a plastic bag and then put in a cafe in the Iraqi capital's al-Amriya neighborhood, where it detonated around 10 p.m. (3 p.m. ET), according to police. They estimated the device contained about two kilograms of highly explosive material. The explosion ripped through the three-story building, which also includes an ice cream parlor on the first floor and medical offices on the second floor. The coffee shop was on the third floor. Most of those killed and hurt were young men, though four children were among the dead, police said. Mostly Sunni Muslims live in the neighborhood, which is surrounded by walls except for one checkpoint staffed by Iraqi soldiers. The violence follows a spate of attacks preceding the country's provincial elections, set for Saturday. On Wednesday, three people died and 16 were wounded in four explosions in and around Baghdad, according to police. There is concern that the security situation could affect the outcome of the vote, especially if Iraqis don't participate because of fears that polling stations may come under attack. U.N. official Martin Kobler appealed Thursday for security forces to be on ""heightened alert"" so that citizens can vote ""in a safe environment without fear of violence."" In the same statement, Kobler -- the special representative in Iraq for the U.N. secretary-general -- stressed that Iraqi leaders must ""collectively endure a transparent and peaceful election, free of intimidation or political interference."" And he urged Iraqis to vote, casting it as their patriotic duty. ""I am calling on all women and men to cast their ballots for a better future for them and their children,"" Kobler said. ""My appeal goes particularly to young Iraqis, because you are the future of this country.""

"(CNN) -- Recent events have left Syria watchers near breathless: government loss of control of border crossings into Iraq and Turkey, rebels temporarily holding portions of Damascus, the unexplained movement of some of Syria's extensive arsenal of chemical weapons, and fighting spreading to the streets of the traditional Alawite stronghold of Aleppo. Most dramatic though was the bombing of a National Security Council meeting in the heart of Syria's defense establishment, the Levantine equivalent of a bomb going off in the White House situation room. Among those killed was Assef Shawkat. Shawkat was Syria's chief of military intelligence during my time at CIA. The agency spent a great deal of time trying to work with him to get the Syrians to stanch the flow of foreign fighters through Damascus airport and onward into Iraq. The Syrians never offered more than token cooperation, a policy that many in Damascus may now regret as the routes they sponsored have been reversed with fighters now entering Syria from Iraq. Our assessment at the time that Shawkat was tough, professional and loyal has stood up. Married to President Bashar al-Assad's sister, he seems to have been providing a significant fraction of the regime's spine over the past year. No one who has met al-Assad has come away impressed with the man's leadership or decisiveness. If fate had been more kind, his elder brother Bassel would not have crashed his car and died in an automobile accident and al-Assad could have lived out his days in an environment for which he was much better suited: doing eye surgery in London, building a happy family with his thoroughly Anglicized Sunni wife. Personally ill-equipped to enact any of the ""reforms"" he sometimes called for, unable or unwilling to bend the Assads, Mahkloufs and other Alawite clans to a new direction, al-Assad is now doubling down on his father's violent response to opposition with none of Hafez Assad's skill or political sense. Opinion: Syria's chemical weapons threat demands response . I hesitate to call last week's events a tipping point, but Shawkatt's death (along with the other senior fatalities) will shake the Alawites to their core. Although some are irreversibly all in, there will certainly be others ready to cut their losses. And so, many observers are now focusing on endgame scenarios, particularly what a successor regime might look like. That question turns on what exactly is happening on the ground. The intelligence community has been continually asked to characterize the opposition -- its strengths, weaknesses, foreign influences. leadership, trustworthy personalities, untrustworthy components, political demands and overall intentions. But beyond these discreet facts, the intelligence community will also have to provide a narrative and identify compelling plot lines to help inform and shape policy. There are actually several plots lines affecting Syria today, all of them true and all of them relevant. In a curious way, at a macro-geopolitical level, we are seeing a resurgence of a broad East-West competition, with the Russians -- stung by what they view as the West's ""bait and switch"" U.N. resolution authorizing action in Libya -- joining the Chinese in blocking meaningful action through the United Nations. Similarly, the broad Sunni-Shia competition in the region has Shia Iran trying to protect its lone Arab ally by putting its thumb on the Syrian scale with arms and advisors while Saudi Arabia, Qatar and other Sunni states arm and train the opposition. The most visible narrative is the one recorded on cell phone videos and broadcast daily showing a vicious, autocratic state using superior weaponry to gun down a determined and popular opposition. This is the plot line that has galvanized world opinion, igniting calls for intervention from a variety of sources. As true as this narrative is, it is also incomplete. Syria is a multi-ethnic and religiously plural society. The Alawites and other Shia remnants comprise about 13% of the population; for 40 years they have controlled the state and have not hesitated to brutalize the more than 60% of the population who are Arab Sunnis and who are now in the streets attempting to overthrow their persecutors. The rest of the population -- ethnic Kurds (10%), Druze (3%) and Christians (10%) -- remain largely on the sidelines, for now at least as fearful of a Sunni successor government as they are of continued Alawite control. Thus we should not allow the dramatic power of the most visible narrative, the struggle between oppressed and oppressor, to drown out the sad reality of another less noble story line -- namely that this is still, at least for now, a sectarian conflict. That this is the dominant narrative, the one that is most controlling and the one we should pay most attention to, is suggested by Vali Nasr's 2006 post mortem on Iraq. Nasr observed that we mistakenly ""thought of politics as the relationship between individuals and the state"" rather than recognizing ""that people in the Middle East see politics also as the balance of power among communities."" We would do well to keep that in mind as the Syrian end game approaches. We should accelerate work to get the minorities into the game against the regime, hastening its end and broadening its opposition. The Christian and Kurdish communities have historic ties to the West that should play to our advantage in this. We should also meter our support to the opposition based on its inclusiveness. Syrians before the Assads lived in relative religious and ethnic harmony under largely Sunni rule. It could be so again, but Lebanon and Bosnia offer examples where historic harmonies have fractured. The fall of the House of Assad is now as inevitable as it is welcome. But if this means a successor regime that is exclusively Sunni, trending fundamentalist and opposed by a third of the Syrian population, it could actually make things worse. And that would be a sad outcome indeed. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael V. Hayden.","Michael Hayden: The endgame is approaching for the Syrian regime .

"(CNN) -- The Russian government shares many of the U.S. concerns about the continuing violence in Syria, but Moscow is reluctant to embrace Washington's proposals to solve them because it is wary of its motives, experts say. ""I was in Moscow a little over a week ago talking to our people in the embassy,"" former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Jack Matlock told CNN Tuesday in a telephone interview. ""They characterized our positions as 95% the same."" For example, he said, Moscow has complied with many U.S. demands on weapons sales. ""They have not been giving them offensive weapons; they've cut way back on weapons supplies. And just recently they've refused to supply contracted weapons."" He noted that Russian government officials were to meet with members of the Syrian opposition in Moscow. Russia: Syrian opposition leader in Moscow for meeting with Lavrov . And Russian officials have backed most of the international sanctions imposed on Damascus, he said. ""They are acutely aware that they don't want to end up on the wrong side of this."" But Russia joined China in using its veto power to block a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down, which elicited anger from U.S. officials and others. The elephant in the region is Libya. Last year, Russia abstained from a Security Council vote authorizing NATO's use of force to protect civilians in Libya. The Russians saw the ouster of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi as having exceeded the mandate. ""We cannot allow a repeat of such scenarios in other countries, in Syria, for example,"" Russian President Vladimir Putin said Monday at a meeting in Moscow of Russian ambassadors and representatives of international organizations. ""I believe that we must do everything possible to press the parties in this conflict into negotiating a peaceful political solution to all issues of dispute. We must do all we can to facilitate such a dialogue. Of course this is a more complex and subtle undertaking than intervention using brute force from outside, but only this process can guarantee a lasting settlement and future stable development in the region, and in Syria's case, in the country itself."" In addition, the Russians have looked warily at the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and plans to include their southeastern neighbors Georgia and the Ukraine in NATO, he said. ""The Russians have an almost mania that we are trying to control the world, to surround them with military means, and that there are elements, including the government, that are trying to, in effect, use the Arab Spring to bring a bunch of satellites under American military control,"" said Matlock. ""I think they're wrong about many of those things, but it's genuinely held."" Moscow's belief that the United States is playing a zero-sum game against them ""makes them hypercautious about cooperating,"" he said. Further complicating the issue is Moscow's concern that extremist Islamists could emerge as powers to be reckoned with in countries affected by the Arab Spring, Matlock said. ""Here again, I think they are misunderstanding and exaggerating, but the point is that their position is not primarily motivated by trying to protect Assad in Syria. They do have interests there, but those interests are really subordinate to some of these other factors."" Though Moscow has moved to boost pressure on al-Assad, there are limits to how far it will go, he said. ""Will they vote at the U.N. for military intervention from the outside? No, they won't. And I hope they won't. I think that would be a disaster for everybody. The fact is nobody has a reliable solution to end this. The idea if only they would vote for us and Assad would give up and everything would be sweetness and light? That's looking for pie in the sky."" He described Syria's nearly 17-month uprising as an internal revolt against a strong military power. ""If there is overt, external intervention, it's going to just make matters worse,"" he said, adding that that there is no easy fix to the killings, which by some estimates have exceeded 14,000. ""In the final analysis, if the country is determined to have a civil war, we cannot prevent it and getting in the middle of it and killing even more people doesn't really help things."" In Moscow, Pavel Palazhchenko, the head of international and media relations at the Gorbachev Foundation, said Russia's long-time policy of close cooperation, first with Hafez Assad and then with his son, is difficult to change, but doing so could prove beneficial to Putin. Russia Analyst: Russia wouldn't resist intervention in Syria . ""I think now is a good opportunity for Russia to perhaps start discussing easing Assad from power and maybe taking him in, actually giving him some kind of asylum, some kind of guarantees,"" he said Wednesday. ""Then, Russia would have more influence on what is going to happen in Syria afterwards. ... The opportunity is there, but apparently Russia finds it very difficult to change the policy that it has had for so many years."" The Russian-born president of the Center for the National Interest, Dimitri Simes, told CNNI's ""Amanpour"" on Monday that Russia's halt to arms sales to Damascus may have had nothing to do with international pressure. ""The Assad regime has no money to pay for Russian weapons,"" said Simes, whose organization describes itself as a non-partisan public policy institution established by former President Richard Nixon. Still, Putin is well aware of international sentiment about al-Assad. ""He doesn't want to be the only guy who's supporting this failing tyrant,"" Simes said, adding that Russian officials have made clear that they would not use force on his behalf. ""The Russian position, basically, is if NATO and the United States want to interfere with Syria, Russia is not going to stop them, but Russia is not going to support it either,"" he said. Simes described U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's statement last week that Russia was ""standing up"" for the regime of al-Assad as ""unhelpful."" She urged a ""Friends of Syria"" conference in Paris to ""make it clear that Russia and China will pay a price"" for that position. ""Russia is clearly trying to meet the United States halfway -- behind the scenes,"" Simes said about Putin. ""The last thing you want to do is to put him publicly into the corner -- if you want his cooperation. I think, on Secretary Clinton's part, this megaphone diplomacy is primarily for domestic consumption."" He added, ""And I almost have an impression -- so sorry to be cynical -- essentially the suggestion is that the Obama administration does not want to intervene in Syria, and wants to use Russia as an alibi."" ""With respect, I don't agree with Dmitri Simes,"" responded Nicholas Burns, former U.S. ambassador to NATO, in an interview Tuesday with ""Amanpour."" He said the Russians would still block any kind of planned international military intervention in Syria. ""Russia's just trying to put itself in the driver's seat to be a potential peacemaker between Assad and the opposition,"" he said. Burns also disputed Simes' suggestion that the United States did not want to intervene in Syria and was blaming Moscow for its lack of action. Effecting regime change in Syria would require dense urban warfare and would likely prove far more difficult to accomplish than it did in Libya, he said. Burns said Putin may be in a unique position to avoid all that by persuading al-Assad to exit Syria and go into exile in a third country, ""perhaps in a deal to be forgiven any possibility of imprisonment or being tried for war crimes. If President Putin wanted to be the one to make that happen, I think you'd find a lot of countries supporting him, including, possibly, the United States and the European countries themselves."" Tom Graham, the managing director at Kissinger Associates, Inc., where he focuses on Russian and Eurasian affairs, said the problem will not be resolved if it turns into a conflict of interests between the United States and Russia. ""We really have to find a way to work together, and I think there's enough overlap in the way the Russians look at it and we look at it for us to start and have a much more constructive, quiet dialogue that will take into account the interests of the United States and Russia,"" he told CNN Tuesday in a telephone interview. ""Just as important, it will also put an end to the violence more quickly than a confrontational approach between the two countries."" Graham, who served as senior director for Russia on the National Security Council staff from 2004-2007, said there are questions within the Russian elite as to whether al-Assad is viable as a leader over the long term. ""They're prepared to see him go, but the method and timing is important. They're really like to see this as part of an internal process as opposed to something imposed from the outside.""

"(CNN) -- Syrian troops shelled restive neighborhoods Saturday during a massive push in the city of Homs, activists said. An onslaught occurred in the flashpoint neighborhood of Bab Amr, said activists Abu Omar, based in the western city, and Alexander Page, speaking to CNN from Cairo, where he is in touch with people in Homs. Omar and Page said thousands of troops entered Homs. ""They are surrounding the area from everywhere,"" Omar said. As CNN spoke to him by phone, heavy gunfire could be heard in the background. The operation occurred as the Arab League prepared to start its monitoring mission next week, part of an initiative to end the violence in Syria. Another activist in Homs, Abu Salim, said at least 4,000 security personnel were surrounding Bab Amr and the number was increasing. The troops dug trenches around parts of the neighborhood. He said the neighborhood's population before the security forces arrived was at least 50,000. Now, many people have fled, fearing death and escaping the harsh humanitarian conditions. ""Much of the shelling in the city is coming from the local headquarters of military intelligence in the city. They shell different neighborhoods from there,"" Salim said. ""Tanks are present in some neighborhoods and they directly shoot at homes."" Salim said people are targeted if they walk the streets, there are shortages of fuel, heating oil and baby formula, and ""the humanitarian situation is really difficult."" ""The sounds of explosions are almost continuous and rarely stop even through the night,"" he said. Salim said makeshift medical clinics are trying to make do. ""We lack any sophisticated medical tool or equipment. ... We only use first aid kits and tools to deal with bullet wounds. Most of the wounded end up dying. ... We do not have enough doctors or nurses to help the injured,"" he said. Omar said he saw more than 40 injured people at a field hospital. Asked why he thinks security forces are targeting Bab Amr, he said the neighborhood is staunchly against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and is ""making a lot of problems for the regime."" He asked the international community for its support. ""We want your help. ... We just need a no-fly zone, and more pressure on al-Assad's regime,"" Omar said. At least five neighborhoods in Homs have been attacked, Salim said. Security forces also shelled the neighborhoods of Bayada, Khaldiyeh, and Karm Al-Zaitoun, and warplanes flew over the area, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria (LCC), an opposition activist network. The LCC said 38 people were killed across the country Saturday, including 25 in Homs. It also said security forces assassinated Ghazi Mohammad Khaled Zoaib, former secretary general of the Homs' division of the Baath Party, and his wife, Rajaa Mohammad Khaled Bakkar. That incident occurred during a raid on their house in Bab Amr. ""The martyr had been threatened before by the regime as a result of his support of the revolutions since its beginning,"" the LCC said. It said two army defectors were also killed. A massive demonstration was taking place in the neighborhood of Malaab, a protest in solidarity with the people of Bab Amr. CNN cannot independently verify reports of deaths and injuries in Syria. The Syrian government has restricted access to international journalists. The attacks in Homs came a day after dual bombings struck the country's capital, Damascus. Al-Assad's government blamed terrorists inside and outside of Syria, but the opposition called the attacks the work of the regime. Syria has entered its bloodiest period in a months-long uprising, raising questions about whether observers from the Arab League will be able to stem the growing violence. The United States, which has called for al-Assad to step aside and has initiated sanctions against the regime, deplored the bombings, said there ""is no justification for terrorism of any kind"" and expressed hope that the strike doesn't undermine the Arab League efforts. ""It is crucial that (the) attack not impede the critical work of the Arab League monitoring mission to document and deter human rights abuses with the goal of protecting civilians,"" State Department deputy spokesman Mark Toner told reporters Friday. ""We hope that this mission will proceed unfettered in an atmosphere of non-violence. The burden is on the regime to cooperate fully and quickly with the monitoring mission."" More than 5,000 people have died since al-Assad began a brutal crackdown in mid-March on anti-government protesters calling for his ouster, the United Nations said earlier this month. Many more deaths have since been reported. AVAAZ, a New York-based political activist group, and the LCC said more than 6,000 people have been killed. The Syrian government has said 2,000 of its soldiers and security forces have been killed in the uprising, which it blames on ""armed gangs."" A surge of violence this week claimed almost 300 lives, according to the opposition Syrian National Council. Funerals occurred Saturday for 44 people killed in the two suicide car bombings at the offices of two security branches in Damascus, the Ministry of Interior said in a statement released to the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency. At least 166 were wounded in the attack, the ministry said. The violent crackdown by al-Assad's security forces against the opposition has garnered worldwide condemnation from the European Union, the Arab League and Turkey in addition to the United States. CNN's Samira Said, Mohamed Fadel Fahmy and Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report.","NEW: At least 38 people are reportedly killed in Syria, including 25 in Homs .

"London (CNN) -- ""If you want to experience the essence of a foreign destination on a short visit,"" says Elyse Pasquale, ""then nothing beats sampling the local food."" She should know. The American journalist and food-blogger is speaking at the end of a journey that has seen her traverse Belgium, Holland, France and the UK in under 24 hours. This whistle-stop European tour is part of Pasquale's Foodie International mission to consume 100 unique meals in 100 countries. So far she has eaten in a grand total of 62 different nations and visited all corners of the globe, from India to Ireland and Mozambique to Mexico. ""Food is an entirely sensory experience. You can touch it, you can smell it, you can taste it. What better way is there to learn about a place you've never been before,"" she asks. See also: Celebrity chefs create mile-high menus . Pasquale has sampled delights as diverse as raw cod fish sperm sacs in Tokyo, reindeer carpaccio in Oslo and fried scorpion in Beijing. And along her culinary way she has worked out how to make the most of interesting locales on a tight schedule, a scenario that will be familiar to many a business traveler. ""I use social media a lot when I travel. I use it to connect with locals and get recommendations. I find it more effective than guidebooks because things can often go out of date quickly."" ""For example I was in recently in Georgia so I reached out on Twitter about places to go in Tbilisi. A wine reporter in Germany got back and recommended a friends wine bar."" Being able to go out and enjoy the best activities and places to eat is all the easier with a little forward planning, Pasquale says. Social media is a fantastic aid for this but a lot of the time nothing beats the pleasant surprises that arise from chatting to the locals and following your gut, she adds. ""When you are traveling for a limited amount of time, go to a local coffee shop and talk to the bartender, talk to the taxi drivers."" ""You have to put yourself out there. You can learn about their words for different types of food and drink. I like to say that I can say 'can I have a beer please' in every language."" ""I asked for a beer once in Bratislava and they freaked out because they thought I spoke Slovakian. It was a great ice breaker and people shouldn't be afraid to look stupid."" See also: Flying chefs serve up fine dining in the sky . But inherent with such adventurous, free-spirited tactics lurk some obvious dangers. Namely, remaining safe in unfamiliar environments and ensuring nothing gastronomically upsetting is consumed. As any road warrior will testify, such misfortunes are hard to plan for and can end up eating into precious business or recreational time. ""As a woman traveling alone, I find myself constantly on guard, much more so than if I were a man, or traveling in a group,"" Pasquale explains. As far as ensuring dietary discipline meanwhile, she employs a thorough checklist which has hitherto kept her on the straight and narrow. ""I have a three step process,"" she advises. ""I eat a lot of spicy foods. This is a preventative thing to kill germs and is something I really believe works."" ""I drink alcohol. I'll have a beer, wine or even the local moonshine like grappa or ouzo depending on where you are. It can be really powerful but it kills the germs."" ""The other thing I do is eat lots of local yoghurt. Yoghurt is full of good bacteria. So you're consuming local bacteria and I find that that's the best."" See also: Seven ways to go local when traveling . But while vigilance and discipline is essential in these matters, Pasquale is clear they shouldn't dominate perceptions or subtract from the joys of travel. Going to far flung places and not taking advantage of all the great foods and cultural activities on offer would be too much of a waste to consider, she says. ""When you get to where you're going, you just have to be open and remember that's what most expensive isn't always best."" ""I've had some expensive meals that I couldn't care less about. But there are so many times when I have total food freak-outs, generally yelling to the stranger next to me, 'I've never had this before, and I love it.'"" ""It's these little things along with meeting the people along the way that make traveling so great.""","Elyse Pasquale is an American journalist and food blogger on a culinary adventure .

"(CNN) -- The Syrian cab driver tolerated beatings, arrests and daily indignities during the country's 16 months of turmoil. But after a rocket struck his house in the Daraa province city of Herak last week, the man and his family finally had enough. The 29-year-old Sunni man, his wife, two young daughters and other relations left their homes on July 16 and embarked on a journey at night to the nearby Jordanian border. He was among the more than 120,000 people who've fled to the neighboring countries -- Turkey, Iraq, Lebanon and Jordan -- to escape the warring in Syria. Syrian military stretched amid defection, fighting . The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Antonio Guterres, on Friday expressed his growing concern for the dramatic flight. ""With the spread of deadly violence, I am gravely concerned for the thousands of Syrian civilians and refugees who have been forced to flee their homes,"" Guterres said. The driver's story punctuates the misery across the restive nation, engulfed in what is now regarded as a civil war between Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government and its foes. The cabbie is one of millions who have had to wrestle with whether they should brave staying or resort to leaving. The man, who answered questions from CNN via translators at the Bashabsheh resettlement camp in Jordan, didn't want his name used. But he cited many factors that led to what was a spontaneous trip to the border. ""It had been increasingly difficult to work as a driver due to stricter and more frequent road checkpoints and fear of random arrests and imprisonment,"" he said. ""Everybody in Daraa is being targeted by Syrian security because the revolution started there."" The miseries of daily life hit home, he said. ""Shopping for milk for the children was risky. Medical care became inaccessible."" He had been apprehended twice, once in June 2011 when he was arrested in his taxi at a checkpoint and beaten up while taking a man to visit his wife, in labor at a hospital. Two months later, he was arrested while waiting in his taxi for three men in a money-exchange shop. Security officers accused the three of arranging a demonstration. They arrested the men and the taxi driver. The driver was beaten up. Tide fleeing Syria swells . He was scared about the psychological well-being of his daughter, growing anxious over the sounds of gunfire and war. He thinks that his participation in peaceful demonstrations may have put him at great risk. He and his family, along with two of his sisters and their children, went to an assembly where the Free Syrian Army helps fleeing Syrians. Women and children traveled to the border in vehicles and the men walked as the Jordanian army waited for them to arrive. The cab driver said he and the other refugees regularly commiserate about life. ""The greatest difficulties are leaving houses, their country and their life. It is difficult to accept, but there is no choice because of the children,"" the driver said. ""Seeking asylum is the worst thing in life."" U.N. refugee officials, neighboring governments and non-governmental agencies have been working to help refugees, and the United Nations recently launched a drive for $193 million to help refugees. The plan has received about a quarter of the amount needed. Syrians have been trickling out of the country during the conflict but those numbers have tripled since April, the U.N. refugee agency said. The latest U.N. number is that as of Wednesday, 120,000 have sought protection but the refugee agency says the local governments count many more. Time to drop the Annan plan . The number of Syrians now in camps in Turkey has surpassed 43,000, disaster and emergency officials from that country said. The U.N. refugee agency said recently it has registered well over 30,000 in both Lebanon and Jordan. But the flight is fluid. There are reports of 8,500 to 30,000 people crossing into Lebanon in a two-day period. More than 8,000 have crossed the border into Iraq. ""I am extremely grateful Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq and Turkey have maintained open borders,"" Guterres said. One irony is that Iraqis who had fled to Syria because of war and instability have been touched by the unrest. Some, for example, have had to flee the Damascus suburb of Seida Zeinab, and an Iraqi family was found dead in Damascus. ""I fear for the civilians caught up in the violence in Damascus, including the large Iraqi refugee population residing there,"" Guterres said. Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki deplored the attack against Iraqis and urged his fellow citizens to return. He said on Friday those who don't ""have blood on their hands"" will be forgiven, a reference to violence during the war. ""We appeal to the United Nations to intervene promptly and in cooperation with the Syrian authorities to protect Iraqis and help them and to facilitate the process of return to Iraq,"" he said. U.N. officials say they think the flight inside the country is greater than the flight across its borders. Maybe as many as a million have fled, but it is impossible to determine an accurate figure of internally displaced people, the U.N. refugee agency said. As for the refugees, Panos Moumtzis, Syria regional refugee coordinator for the United Nations, said many cross through unofficial border points during the night. About 75 percent of those registered by the United Nations are women and children, and most of them are Sunnis, who make up the majority of Syrians and a bulk of the opposition to al-Assad's regime. Moumtzis said the sprawling and restive Homs province has been the top place of refugee origin. People have fled Damascus and its suburbs as well as Daraa in recent days as fighting persists. People leave simply because they no longer feel safe. Many are destitute or have depleted savings and arrive with only the ""clothes on their back."" Moumtzis said there's a ""direct correlation between fighting and a wave of refugees."" ""People escaped from areas where there's been heavy shelling,"" he said. ""... They arrive quite traumatized and in an emotional fragile state."" They are relying entirely on humanitarian assistance, even though there are some employment opportunities, such as farm work in Jordan, he said. The governments, the United Nations and non-government groups are providing food, schooling, and health care, and are steering refugees to or providing them with accommodations, either in camps or apartments. Each country where people seek refuge poses different conditions and challenges. The security situation in Lebanon is extremely fragile, officials and observers say. There has been fighting in Tripoli between pro-Assad and anti-Assad groups. Moumtzis said Turkey has well-organized refugee camps and the country has served as a passage for traveling to other nations. Cyprus is gearing up for third-country nationals as it did during the Israeli-Hezbollah war last decade. Many of the refugees to Iraq are young Syrian Kurdish men who want to avoid military service. That group tends to go to Iraq's Kurdish region. Some refugees are living with friends are families and don't register with the United Nations. Some fear Syrian government retribution if they sign up with the United Nations, creating a paper trail. A 38-year-old salesman in the town of Dael, in Daraa province, left Syria with his wife and five children after the impact of a missile hurt her and another missile killed a neighbor. They immediately decided to flee Syria before their children were killed. Living there had been an ordeal, as an environment once harmonious had become replete with attacks and funerals. ""Syrians used to live together -- Kurds, Christians and all Arabs without discrimination,"" but Assad is ""planting discrimination,"" he said. The Muslim call to prayer, he said, has been changed from ""Allah Akbar"" to ""Assad Akbar."" He said pro-government Shabiha militia members once violently coaxed him to pray to al-Assad instead of God. He said ""I love Assad"" to cooperate, but wouldn't pray to him, even with a gun to his head. The salesman followed his brothers' examples. One escaped to Lebanon and another to Saudi Arabia. But he worries that his married sisters are remaining in Syria and his parents refuse to leave. ""He would go back to Syria today if it were safe, but the reality is dangerous,"" the translator who spoke to the salesman said. ""Therefore, for now, he does not know where he will live; the problem is financial. A sponsor will not provide everything. He does not know about the cost of rent, cooking, etc. He does not know if he can support his family.""

"(CNN) -- A confidential draft U.N. report accuses Iran of exporting arms to the Syrian government in violation of a ban on weapons sales, a Western diplomat said Wednesday on condition of anonymity. The draft report describes three seizures of Iranian weapons shipments, including two bound for Syria, within the past year, said the diplomat, who was not authorized to release details to the media. The report was drafted by a panel of experts and submitted to the U.N. Security Council's committee that monitors sanctions against Iran, the official told CNN. There was no immediate reaction to the report on Iranian government-run Press TV. The accusation came as al-Assad, in a rare interview, told Russia 24 that weapons bound for rebels were entering his country from neighboring Lebanon and Turkey. ""You can't simply close the borders and stop the smuggling, but you can reduce the flow,"" he said. In recent days, violence has spilled over into Lebanon and Turkey, where thousands of Syrians have fled. At least one person was killed and an undetermined number were wounded Thursday in renewed clashes in the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli between factions supporting and opposing the uprising in Syria, Lebanon's National News Agency reported. Al-Assad put the blame instead on the so-called Arab Spring, during which popular revolutions have toppled the governments of Egypt, Libya and Tunisia. ""If we take into consideration the developments in Syria, the events in Libya and other countries, for the leaders of these countries, it's becoming clear that this is not 'spring' but chaos,"" al-Assad said. The Arab Spring movements inspired the uprising in Syria, which began in March 2011 with protests calling for political reforms. It devolved into a revolt with an armed opposition amid a crackdown by al-Assad's forces. The United Nations estimates that at least 9,000 people have died in the 14 months of conflict, while opposition groups put the death toll at more than 11,000. CNN cannot independently verify reports of deaths and violence because the Syrian government has severely restricted access by international media. At least 20 people were killed Thursday in attacks across the country, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, an opposition network that collects casualty reports and organizes anti-government protests. The deaths include 10 in the Damascus suburbs of Daraya and Douma, three in Idlib, three in Daraa, two in Homs, one in Raqqa, and one in Swaida, the LCC said. Syria blames violence in the country on ""armed terrorist groups."" Some groups ""continued perpetrating massacres and targeting law enforcement members and citizens, and vandalizing public and private properties"" on Thursday, state-run news agency SANA reported. Thirteen ""army, law enforcement and civilian martyrs"" were buried Thursday, SANA said. It added that 72 people from Aleppo, Idlib and Damascus ""who were involved in the latest events but didn't commit crimes, gave themselves up with their weapons to the authorities Wednesday."" Opposition groups, including members of the rebel army, say al-Assad's government has been trying to hamper their efforts by accusing them falsely of links to terrorism. A video posted on YouTube purported to show thousands of anti-government protesters outside Aleppo University, where blue-helmeted men could be seen. The U.N. observes wear blue helmets. CNN could not confirm the authenticity of the video. While rebel forces, called the Free Syrian Army, say their ranks are filled by defectors from Syria security forces, al-Assad described them as criminals. ""It's not an army, first of all, and it's not free because they get their arms from different foreign countries,"" he said in the interview. ""That's why they are not free at all -- they are a bunch of criminals who have been violating the law for years and have been sentenced in various criminal cases. There are religious extremist elements among them, like those from al Qaeda."" Al-Assad dismissed the international pressure brought to bear for him to end the violence and step down, vowing that Syria would not bow on any issue. The United States, the European Union and the United Nations have targeted Syria with a number of economic sanctions targeting al-Assad and his government. Al-Assad acknowledged the sanctions have hurt Syria's economy. ""The world doesn't consist just of Europe and the United States, and we find alternatives which allow us to overcome these difficulties,"" he said. ""We can support small and mid-sized business, the basic element of our economy is agriculture, and it's hard to affect it with sanctions."" He also called a boycott of recent parliamentary elections by the opposition a failure. ""It seems to some people that if we conducted the reforms earlier, the situation would have been better now. It's not right for one reason -- terrorists spit on reforms. They are not fighting for reforms, they are fighting to bring terror,"" he said. Meanwhile, the U.S. government distanced itself from a Washington Post report that said more and better weapons are making their way into the hand of Syrian rebels. The newspaper, citing unidentified officials and opposition activists, reported that the arms are being paid for by Persian Gulf nations and coordinated, in part, by the United States. ""The United States has made a decision to provide nonlethal support to civilian members of the opposition,"" Victoria Nuland, a State Department spokeswoman told reporters Wednesday. ""... But with regard to any assertions with regard to lethal, we are not involved in that."" The United States has expressed reservations about arming rebels, citing division among the opposition. Meanwhile, those divisions deepened Thursday with the Syrian National Council, widely perceived by Western countries as a primary coalition for the opposition, coming under fire by a leading opposition activist group. The LCC called the national council a ""failure,"" and vowed to withdraw from the group. The council has been under fire for failing to unify the opposition groups and bring in international support.

"London (CNN) -- Britain has closed its embassy in Iran and evacuated all its staff from that country following the attack on the embassy compound in Tehran Tuesday, British Foreign Secretary William Hague said Wednesday. Iran has also been ordered to close its embassy in London immediately, with its staff given 48 hours to leave, Hague said in a strongly worded statement to the UK Parliament. Protesters stormed Britain's embassy and a separate compound Tuesday in Iran's capital, sparking outrage in the United Kingdom. The buildings should have been guarded by Iranian security officers. Some demonstrators proceeded to vandalize and loot the homes of staff and the ambassador's residence, destroy furniture, steal their property and set fire to the main embassy office building, Hague said. ""This is a breach of international responsibilities of which any nation should be ashamed,"" Hague said. While relations between Britain and Iran have been strained in recent times, he said, ""We should be absolutely clear that no difficulty in relations can ever excuse in any way or under any circumstances the failure to protect diplomatic staff and diplomatic premises. ""Iran is a country where opposition leaders are under house arrest, more than 500 people have been executed so far this year and where genuine protest is ruthlessly stamped on. ""The idea that the Iranian authorities could not have protected our embassy or that this assault could have taken place without some degree of regime consent is fanciful."" The majority of about 200 demonstrators who overran the city center embassy compound were members of a student Basij militia organization, he said, which is ""controlled by elements of the Iranian regime."" Hague thanked those European and Arab nations that offered assistance to British Embassy staff following the incident. British citizens still in Iran will be supported by other EU missions there, he said. The United Nations Security Council, the United States, Germany, Poland, Russia and France have all expressed their concern over the incursion, which went against international law, he said. Alistair Burt, British under-secretary of state at the Foreign Office, also accused Iran's government of being involved in the embassy incident on Wednesday, calling it a deliberate provocation. ""The people who were involved are known to have connections with elements of the regime,"" Burt told CNN. He noted, ""Iran is a divided, conflicted leadership ... It is clear that not all parts of leadership were involved. But nothing like that happens in Tehran without leadership being involved in some way."" The attacks happened in ""two separate places, simultaneously,"" Burt said. Protesters who raided the British Embassy and the other British compound were demanding that the British ambassador be sent home immediately. The incident has worried some other nations with diplomatic staff in Tehran. The Netherlands became the latest European nation to recall its ambassador to Iran for consultations late Wednesday, following the lead of France and Germany. The French Foreign Ministry said it was recalling its Tehran envoy, ""given this blatant and unacceptable violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the severity of the violence."" The Iranian charge d'affaires in Paris has been called upon ""to reiterate France's condemnation and to remind the Iranian authorities of their obligations,"" the ministry said in a statement. Norway is closing its embassy there temporarily ""because of a general assessment of the security situation in Iran,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hilde Steinfeld said earlier Wednesday. A statement said the embassy would reopen Thursday. Ireland's Foreign Office urged Iran to reconsider its decision to expel the British ambassador to Tehran and said it should bring those responsible for the embassy incursion to justice. If this does not happen, it said, ""there are likely to be serious consequences for Iran's relations with the EU and the wider international community."" The EU Foreign Affairs Council will address the matter on Thursday, said Bernard Valero, spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry. Tuesday's demonstration in Tehran followed an Iranian Parliament vote Sunday to expel the British ambassador and reduce diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom in retaliation for its new sanctions against Iran, according to IRNA, the country's official news agency. The rally began quietly outside the embassy, but some participants stormed the building, breaking down the door. Among other things, they replaced the British flag with an Iranian one. Speaker Ali Larijani was quoted on the Iranian Parliament's official website as saying that while Iranians should act legally, the decision to expel the British envoy was a response to Britain's own behavior. ""The gathering of the Iranian people in front of the British embassy was a reflection of the nation's public opinion caused by British actions,"" he said, according to the website. Alaedin Boroujerdi, the lawmaker who introduced the expulsion bill, told the semi-official Fars News Agency on Wednesday that while Iran is glad to see the last of the British diplomats, ""The consequences of closing down Iran's embassy in the UK will be London's responsibility."" Britain cut all financial ties with Iran last week over concerns about its nuclear program, the first time it has cut an entire country's banking sector off from British finance. Iran's Foreign Ministry expressed its regret for the student protest, saying on its website that it had ""turned into an out of control demonstration."" The ministry said it would ""take action through legal channels"" against those who stormed the embassy building. ""A number of"" protesters who broke into both places have been arrested, IRNA said, quoting the nation's deputy commander of security forces. Hague warned Tuesday of ""serious consequences"" for the raids. British Prime Minister David Cameron described the incursion as ""outrageous and indefensible"" and demanded that Iran immediately ensure the safety of all British Embassy personnel. Iranian security forces are responsible for guarding the embassy under international law, he said. ""The failure of the Iranian government to defend British staff and property was a disgrace,"" the prime minister said. ""The Iranian government must recognize that there will be serious consequences for failing to protect our staff,"" Cameron said. ""We will consider what these measures should be in the coming days."" Last week's sanctions ordered British credit and financial institutions to end their business relationships and transactions with all Iranian banks, their branches and subsidiaries. The move came after an International Atomic Energy Agency report highlighted new concerns about ""the possible military dimensions of Iran's nuclear program,"" the British Treasury statement said last week. Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful and has called the U.N. watchdog's report ""unbalanced"" and ""politically motivated."" CNN's Adam Levine, Elizabeth Joseph, Antonia Mortensen, Claudia Rebaza, Shirzad Bozorgmehr and Mitra Mobasherat contributed to this report.","NEW: The Netherlands recalls its ambassador to Iran for consultations .

"(CNN) -- Syrian President Bashar al-Assad slammed British leaders as ""shallow and immature"" and accused the British government of trying to arm rebels seeking his ouster. Al-Assad told The Sunday Times that the British government can't play a useful role in stopping the Syrian crisis. ""We do not expect an arsonist to be a firefighter,"" al-Assad told the newspaper. ""To be frank, Britain has played famously in our region (an) unconstructive role in different issues, for decades, some say for centuries. I'm telling you the perception in our region,"" he said. ""The problem with this government (is) that they are shallow and immature. Rhetorics only highlight this tradition of a bullying hegemony."" British Foreign Secretary William Hague has hurled equally harsh words toward al-Assad. Sunday was no different. ""I think this will go down as one of the most delusional interviews that any national leader has given in modern times,"" he told BBC in an interview. In February, the European Union renewed its arms embargo on Syria for three months but amended it to allow greater non-lethal support and technical assistance to help protect civilians. The shift in the arms embargo set an important precedent, Hague said. ""This is an important and welcome step forward. It shows we can change the arms embargo, and the worse the situation becomes, the more ready we will be to change it,"" he said earlier in a statement. This month marks the two-year anniversary of the Syrian civil war, a conflict that has killed at least 70,000 people, according to international estimates. Earlier this year, al-Assad outlined a plan to resolve the Syrian crisis. His plan included national dialogue and a new constitution that would be put up for a public referendum. But there's a major caveat: Al-Assad said he refuses to deal with ""terrorists,"" a term the government often uses to describe the opposition. Similarly, opposition members have said they will not work directly with al-Assad's ""criminal"" government, nor will they accept any solution that doesn't involve al-Assad's departure. So the deadly impasse continues. At least 123 people were found dead across Syria on Sunday, including 38 in Damascus and its suburbs, according to the Local Coordination Committees for Syria, a network of opposition activists. The unrest began in March 2011, when al-Assad's government began a brutal crackdown on demonstrators calling for enhanced political freedoms. The protest movement eventually devolved into an armed conflict, one that has devastated cities and towns around the country and has already claimed nearly 70,000 lives. Oppostion leader returns to Syria . Moaz al-Khatib, president of the National Coalition of Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, appeared in a social media video posted Sunday that purports to show the opposition leader in Syria. The YouTube video shows al-Khatib on a jam-packed street in Menbej. As Al-Khatib walks through the crowd, shopkeepers pop into their doorways to see what the commotion is about. He stops and affectionately greets several people. Dozens of smiling people take photos and videos with their cell phones. CNN cannot independently verify when the video was shot. The people shown in it all wear winter coats or sweaters. Menbej is in a rebel-held area in northern Syria. The opposition group said al-Khatib met with senior officials and judicial council members. He also visited a military camp for the Free Syrian Army and met with field commanders about future operations. ""He is on a tour to northern Syria to affirm his concern with Syrians inside the country and that he is in communication with all segments in the civil society and the military,"" a spokesman said in a written statement. Al-Khatib is a former cleric of the historic Umayyad Mosque in Damascus and is a highly respected figure in Syria. He fled the country last year due to security concerns.","NEW: At least 123 people killed across the country Sunday .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Syrian regime this week fired at least two Iranian-made, short-range ballistic missiles in what appears to be an effort to more precisely target Syrian rebels, two U.S. military officials tell CNN. The Fateh A-110 missiles are more accurate than the older Scud variants that Syrian government forces have used in recent weeks. Read more: NATO: Syrian forces firing more Scud missiles . The U.S. military officials declined to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the information. The Iranian government has not commented on the issue. The Fateh trades range for accuracy. It can travel about 125 miles, while the Scud can go about 185 miles. But the Fateh has a ""circular error probable"" or -- CEP -- of 330 feet, while the Scud's CEP is 1,480 feet. CEP is defined as the radius of a circle in which half of a missile's lethal payload falls and is the standard measure of a missile's accuracy. The firings did not reach near Syria's Turkish border. But the regime's use of ballistic missiles is the reason NATO is planning to send U.S., German and Dutch Patriot missile batteries to Turkish military installations: to protect the southern regions of that NATO ally. All six Patriot batteries are expected to be in place by the end of January. Read more: As Syria suffering spirals, envoy hopes for political transition . A NATO official could not confirm the use of short-range ballistic missiles this week, but NATO did detect the launch of such missiles inside Syria on a few December days, more recently on the 22nd. ""The fact that Scud-type missiles were used in Syria emphasizes the need for effective defense protection of our ally Turkey,"" the NATO official said. ""This is why, earlier this month, NATO allies decided to deploy Patriot missiles in Turkey to augment Turkey's air defenses. The deployment, which will start within weeks, is defensive only. Its aim is to deter any threats to and defend and protect the population and territory of Turkey."" U.S. officials say they believe the Syrians are firing ballistic missiles to preserve their aircraft, some of which have been shot down by rebels.

"(CNN) -- An opposition group reported Thursday that government forces have carried out a ""massacre"" in Hama province, killing 220 people there. Most of the killings occurred in the village of Tremseh, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. The day's death toll nationwide reached 287, making it the bloodiest day in Syria since the uprising against the government began 16 months ago, the opposition group told CNN. As it has done consistently, Syrian state television blamed ""armed terrorist groups"" for the killings, accusing them of having shot ""indiscriminately at the people of Al-Tremseh village in Hama suburbs. And after calls from the people of the village, the security forces clashed with the terrorist groups, arresting a number of them and confiscated their weapons."" Activists in the city of Hama told CNN that witnesses inside Tremseh told them by telephone that Syrian military forces had launched a full-scale attack against the opposition Free Syrian Army inside the town, which was surrounded by government tanks and artillery. The forces had shelled the town continuously from 5 a.m. until noon, when their tanks entered the village, three activists told CNN separately. None of them was willing to be identified publicly. Syrian army forces, whose numbers were bolstered by the pro-regime militias called ""shabeha,"" accompanied the tanks into Tremseh, they said. As the government forces rained artillery rounds into the town, a number of village residents fled their houses into the streets, where many of them were shot dead by the government militias, the activists told CNN in separate telephone interviews. CNN is not able to confirm their accounts because Western journalists have limited access to the country. The violence was also occurring farther south, in the capital, where 12 people were killed, the LCC said. The Damascus neighborhood of Shaghour was under siege by government forces, whose snipers were occupying the roofs of buildings, the LCC said. In the capital city's suburb of Naher Aisha, government forces opened fire on a group of people who were demonstrating in condemnation of the Tremseh killings, LCC said. The carnage came as a top Syrian diplomat who defected Wednesday said in an interview broadcast Thursday that he has sympathized with the opposition movement since it began in March 2011, but had held out hope that President Bashar al-Assad would change course. ""I am from Day One with the revolution,"" Nawaf al-Fares, the former Syrian ambassador to Iraq, told Al Jazeera Arabic. ""Due to the political and personal circumstances, just a few people knew about that."" Al-Fares added, ""I had hope, and I was in direct contact with President Bashar. He is now the former Syrian president, because he is a criminal and he is killing the Syrian people."" Syrian government authorities said al-Fares has been ""relieved of his duties."" Al-Fares is the second high-profile Sunni official to break with the regime in a week. Manaf Tlas, a Republican Guard brigadier general and the son of a former defense minister, defected last week to protest the killing of civilians by government forces. The moves might be a sign that Sunni allies of the Alawite-dominated regime are displeased with the government's fierce crackdown on an opposition dominated by Sunnis. According to the official Syrian Arab News Agency, al-Fares was sworn in as Syrian ambassador to Iraq in 2008. Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari said al-Fares went to the Gulf Arab state of Qatar, Iraqi state TV reported. The Qatari government has been sharply critical of al-Assad's regime. Al-Fares ""made statements contrary to his job duty to defend the positions of the country and its issues, which requires legal accountability and discipline,"" the Syrian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. The statement said he ""no longer has anything to do"" with the Syrian Embassy in Baghdad or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Syria's detached and deluded elite? Al-Fares also announced his defection from the ruling Baath party, becoming the most senior member to leave. He is from Deir Ezzor, the eastern province that has been hammered lately by Syrian forces, and hails from a tribe along the Syrian-Iraqi border. ""To my brothers in the military, your military doctrine is to defend the homeland against external aggression and protect its borders,"" al-Fares said in a video statement given to the TV network Al Jazeera Arabic. It was unclear when the video was shot. ""So did your fathers, sons and sisters become the enemies now? And are they the ones who you should fight? Is that what you have learned in your military schools?"" Al-Fares said he was joining the revolution and called the government ""malicious"" and ""the killer of the people."" The conflict in Syria has raged for 16 months, defying international peace efforts and leaving world leaders scrambling to find a solution. Venezuelan diesel shipments to Syria fuel controversy . Al-Assad's bloody crackdown on the opposition has sparked international outrage, but he still enjoys the support of allies such as Russia, Iran and China. Russia and China, which are permanent U.N. Security Council members, have vetoed council draft resolutions that would have condemned the Syrian regime. Many other nations said such resolutions could have pushed al-Assad to stop the crackdown on dissidents seeking his ouster. Meeting in private, the Security Council on Thursday discussed dueling draft resolutions on Syria. Ambassadors remain at odds primarily over whether a Western-backed resolution should invoke Chapter 7 of the U.N. charter, which could authorize sanctions and ultimately lead to an authorization of the use of force. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Thursday she is hopeful that Russia will back a ""serious"" measure in the Security Council. But Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Gennady Gatilov said his government dislikes a recent council draft resolution from Western nations. ""We have stated repeatedly that Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter is unacceptable to us,"" Gatilov said, according to state-run RIA Novosti. ""Using the resolution to justify the use of force in the future is absolutely unacceptable to us."" German U.N. Ambassador Peter Wittig described the talks as ""good, calm and focused,"" but noted the disagreement over Chapter 7. Chinese and Russian delegates told reporters before the meeting that invoking Chapter 7 would not be acceptable. Asked about the meeting, French Ambassador Gerard Araud said, ""Before, we were 10 miles apart; now, we are 10 miles less five centimeters."" The discussions at the ambassador level were to resume Friday afternoon. A vote on whether to renew the mandate for the 300-person U.N. observer force in Syria is at the heart of the discussions. The current mandate expires July 20. Security Council President Nestor Osorio of Colombia said a ""reference to Chapter 7 is just trying to put real material into Kofi Annan's plan."" Annan, the former U.N. secretary-general who is now an international U.N. and Arab League envoy to Syria, told the council Wednesday from Geneva that he needed the threat of consequences to win more cooperation inside Syria. His six-point peace plan has failed to win support by all sides. Opposition groups say more than 15,000 people have died since the violence began in March 2011. Syrian ambassador to Iraq joins revolt, urges military to turn on regime . CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali, Richard Roth, Teresa Shen, Yousuf Basil, Salma Abdelaziz, Joe Sterling, Caroline Faraj and Amir Ahmed contributed to this report.","287 deaths mark the bloodiest day in the 16-month-old uprising, LCC says .

"(CNN) -- While Apple is busy pushing a smaller tablet to take on Google and Amazon's 7-inch offerings, Google is thinking big. The company has teamed up with Samsung for the new Nexus 10 tablet, a direct competitor to the full-size iPad. The Nexus 10 is a solid entry into the category, with excellent hardware and a stunning screen. It comes in two models and prices: the 16GB version is $399, and the 32GB tablet costs $499. CNNMoney: Google unveils new Nexus tablets and phone . The tablet doesn't go on sale til November 13, but we got our hands on one early. Here are our impressions: . What's Inside . The real selling point of any tablet it its operating system. And if you've ever read the comments on a gadget article, you know that people feel very strongly about which OS and ecosystem is the best. Apple's intuitive iOS -- the system running on iPhones and iPads -- has dominated the market, but competition has cropped up over the years. Google's Android system has had some issues, but it's been slowly improving with each release. Now Microsoft is in the ring with Windows 8, whose tablet system is a refreshing and fun entry that could win over new users. The Nexus 10 is running a new version of Google's operating system, Android 4.2 (still called Jelly Bean). This new update packs some subtle improvements and fun surprises, although it still catches in a few spots, such as built-in apps getting stuck on simple tasks. The main screen is easily customizable. Tap on the middle button on the dock to bring up a grid of all apps, then arrange them any way you like on one of the multiple lock screens, or keep them tucked away in the application view. There are widgets you can add to the background, like interactive photo albums and the weather. In the top left corner is a drop-down list of notifications, and settings are in the top right. The new Android has a swipe-typing feature, so you can drag your finger around the on-screen keyboard to spell a word, only taking your finger off the screen between words. Searching is front and center on the Nexus 10, with multiple places to start a search either by typing or speaking a request. The Google Now feature shows ""cards"" below the search bar, populated with information it thinks is relevant to you, such as nearby restaurants or public transit schedules. It also can now pull key information, like a flight itinerary, straight from your e-mail account. One of the most exciting new features is support for multiple users. Unlike a smartphone, a tablet can get passed around the family or office. Having separate profiles is a great feature that other tablet makers will hopefully pick up soon. (The Kindle Fire and Windows 8 devices have kids' modes, but adults share gadgets, too.) There are many options for customizing the tablets' settings and appearance, and if you're not careful the end result can be a messy and overly confusing interface. If Apple is a strict parent who claims to know what's best for you, Google is the cool uncle who lets you eat ice cream and finger paint on the new sofa. Ecosystem . Tablets are tools that companies can use to sell you more content, apps and services. Amazon is able to sell its $199 Kindle Fire HD for such a low price because the company makes its money by selling users books, movies, TV shows, apps and even physical goods through the device. Apple makes gobs of money off content in the iTunes store, books and apps. Google is no exception, which means there's a subtle sales pitch lurking around every corner. The Google Play store surfaces when you first open the Nexus 10, showing you a selection of books and magazines in the middle of the main screen (the first ones are free, you see). Apps for reading books, listening to music, reading magazines and watching movies are all extensions of the Play store. Google is so excited about how nice magazines will look on the Nexus' high-res screen that it's included two separate apps for looking at them: Currents and Play Magazines. (In another example of needless doubling up of apps, there is a Gmail app and an Email app.) The Nexus 10 would also really like you to have an account for Google+, the company's social network. What's outside . The physical designs of tablets have been somewhat unified since Apple's iPad set the standard in 2010. Today's tablets are thin, usually black rectangles whose fronts are dominated by a touchscreen, with minimal buttons and ports scattered around the edges. Google and Samsung have tried to give the form their own spin. The Nexus 10 is all black, with rounded corners and a familiar sheet of Gorilla Glass covering the entire front side, including the 10-inch screen and its black border. There's a mic jack, a micro HDMI port and a micro-USB charging port. (For people juggling multiple gadgets, it's always a relief when a new addition sticks with the nonproprietary micro-USB option.) The back is coated in a rubbery textured material that gives it a pleasingly sturdy feel, and the smooth shape makes it easy to hold. To some it might feel cheap, but the extra grip actually makes the device seem less precious and more usable, like a case isn't necessary to protect it from damage. The optional front cover should suffice for keeping the important bit -- that big smooth screen -- safe from scratches. And it's a fighting weight: just 1.33 pounds, slightly lighter than the full-size iPad's 1.44 pounds. Screen and speed . Turn on the Nexus 10 and its bright, vivid HD screen blocks out the rest of the design. In the battle of specs, Google just inched in above Apple in the screen resolution department. The screen quality is key for this size of tablet. Ten-inch tablets are often media consumption devices, so movies and photos need to look crisp and vivid. They're also being bought as a replacement for laptops, so this monitor needs to be good enough to work and play on. The Nexus 10 delivers with a killer screen. The 2560-by-1600 screen packs in 300 pixels per inch (compared to the newer iPad's 264 pixels per inch). Movies and TV shows are rendered in full 1080p. A beautiful screen is no good without speedy graphics, and luckily the Nexus 10 has a powerful dual-core A15 processor. Cameras . Taking a photo with a tablet is odd, but as the saying goes, the best camera is the one you have with you. If all you have is an unwieldy rectangle with which to capture a moment, the Nexus 10's back camera is a fine pick. It has a flash and can capture 5-megapixel images and shoot 1080p videos. Tablets are fantastic tools for video chatting, but the front camera always gets cheated on specs. The Nexus 10 is no exception. Its front-facing camera has no flash and captures 1.9 megapixel images and 720p videos. The camera hardware is average, but there are some nice touches in the software. The view is clutter free when you're composing a shot, but tap anywhere on the screen and a nifty control dial appears that lets you adjust settings such as exposure compensation, scene mode, white balance and flash. In the gallery view, you can do detailed edits, including the option to instantly Instagram-ize your images by adding filters and borders. The final touch is the panorama mode. There's the regular rectangular pano mode, which can capture and stitch together 360-degree images. But the winner is the photo sphere mode, which can go in all directions to capture a complete, street view-esque image of your surroundings.","Google's new 10-inch tablet is a direct competitor to Apple's full-size iPad .

"(CNN) -- JoDee Winterhof still hasn't bought her holiday plane tickets. Winterhof wants to take her two children, ages 7 and 4, back to her Walnut, Iowa, hometown for Christmas this year. But there's added pressure on the Washington, D.C., resident: Her parents' 50th wedding anniversary party is scheduled during the same visit. If she can't use frequent flier miles to reduce her bill, she expects to spend $1,100 to $1,300 on three tickets. Because she wants to keep costs low, she plans to stick to her usual strategies of checking prices every few days and comparing prices at different departure and arrival airports. ""I always wait a bit and try to game the pricing but still get flights I want,"" she says. She may not want to wait much longer. Prices are going up . Holiday airfares appear to be going up, the result of the usual higher demand for airline tickets around the holidays, airline mergers, flight cutbacks and higher airline fuel prices. People are also being charged more to check luggage, for coach seats with extra leg room and aisle seats, making it harder to seat families together at the last minute. Travelocity's airfare ""price to beat"" for Thanksgiving is $386 -- an increase of 9% over last year, according to the company's analysis of its Thanksgiving data. That's the travel company's average round-trip domestic airfare inclusive of tax. This year's Thanksgiving fares ""are $5 below our price to beat for July 4 of this year,"" says Courtney Scott, senior editor at Travelocity. ""So while year-over-year prices are up, Thanksgiving fares are about what we were seeing this summer on popular travel weekends."" Do expect ""peak travel day"" surcharges of $20 to $40 each way during the holiday season, says Scott. Travelers may find lower prices if they don't travel on November 21 and 25, December 22, 23 and 26 and January 2, check multiple departure and arrival airports and book packages for flight and hotel. If airline fuel costs continue to rise, ""it should indicate a steady rise in (ticket) prices through the end of December and beginning of January,"" she says. ""It's not a time of year where you're going to see incredibly deep discounted flights. Use our 'price to beat' as a gauge of whether or not you're getting a good deal."" People are willing to spend more . Demand doesn't appear to be letting up. Some 84 million Americans say they are traveling this holiday season, up 7% from last year, according to recent data from the American Express Spending & Saving Tracker. While some 40% claim that budget is the most important factor in their plans, the American Express survey found travelers will spend more on holiday travel this year: $65 billion or about $773 per person, up from $659 last year. (This includes airfare and other travel expenses.) Some 42% of travelers also will fly to their destination this year (compared to 36% last year). They also plan to take longer vacations (27% this year compared to 23% last year), and travel to more expensive destinations (16% this year compared to 12% last year), according to the survey. Travelers should jump on fares that seem reasonable, travel experts say. ""If the price is in the range we expect for the holidays and we actually can find the space we advise our clients to book it as soon as possible,"" says travel agent Michael Holbrook of Columbus Travel/Preferred Vacations in Georgia. Still ways to save? Flexible travelers may still find ways to save, says Brian Kelly, founder of thepointsguy.com. ""Most airlines will let you book or put a fare on hold and cancel by midnight the next day for free,"" he says. ""Put it on hold or book it, and if it goes down the next day, then book the lowest fare. You can keep doing that until the fare goes down."" (If it does, that is.) Remember that certain airlines don't charge for checked bags and some airline credit cards may offer free checked baggage for cardholders. (Don't forget the presents!) Consider an upgrade. ""Coach may be packed but this may be the time to upgrade"" because business travelers tend to stay home over the holidays. ""You'll go online and see your flight is double the amount of miles usually charged, but you may be able to get first or business class for that same amount of miles,"" says Kelly. Plan ahead next year . And there's always the takeaway lesson: put buying airline tickets on your calendar a few months before the holidays to try to get a decent fare next year. It may pay to plan ahead. That's what Joseph Vasquez of Manhattan did this year. He and his partner bought tickets to visit family in Chicago for Thanksgiving. Purchased on August 20, each plane ticket cost $325.60. On the same airline today, the tickets would cost $538. Their savings: $212.40 per ticket. Holbrook recommends booking even earlier. ""Most holiday travelers purchase their tickets and make their reservations 9 to 12 months in advance,"" he says. ""In fact at many resorts they make next year's deposit before they leave this year, and then when the airfares come out, they usually book early."" 6 questions that will save you money on vacation .","Thanksgiving ticket prices are up compared to last year .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- A visit to North Korea and China planned by Iran's parliament speaker was postponed Saturday, the semi-official Mehr news agency reported. Ali Larijani's trips were intended to promote parliamentary cooperation. ""The time for Larijani's visit has changed and we will announce the new time when it is determined,"" said Hijatoleslam Hossein Sobhaninya, a member of the presiding board of parliament, according to Mehr.

"Dublin, Ireland (CNN) -- The situation in Syria is accelerating, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Thursday, amid reports that President Bashar al-Assad's government may be preparing to use chemical weapons. ""Events on the ground in Syria are accelerating, and we see that in many different ways. The pressure against the regime in and around Damascus seems to be increasing,"" Clinton said before meeting with Russia's foreign minister and the U.N. special envoy to Syria. Chemical weapons were one topic on the table, said Clinton, who met with the leaders while she was in Dublin for an international security conference. U.S. officials are ""very concerned"" that al-Assad's forces may use chemical weapons as rebels advance, U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta told reporters in Washington Thursday. ""The intelligence that we have raises serious concerns that this is being considered,"" he said. The defense secretary did not provide additional details about the intelligence information. CNN reported Monday that Syrian forces battling rebels in fierce fighting had started combining chemicals that could be used to make deadly sarin gas for weapons. NBC reported Wednesday night that Syria is loading chemical weapons into bombs. CNN has not confirmed the NBC report. Read more: Syrian family hides from attacks . Syrian Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad rejected the suggestion Thursday. ""Syria would never use chemical weapons, even if it had them, against its own people,"" he told Hezbollah's Al-Manar TV. He also warned that any foreign intervention against Syria would be ""catastrophic"" for the entire region. In Dublin Thursday, U.N. envoy Lakhdar Brahimi said leaders were focused on a peace process to ""get Syria back from the brink."" ""We have agreed that the situation is bad and we have agreed that we must continue to work together to see how we can find creative ways of bringing this problem under control and hopefully starting to solve it,"" he told reporters after his meeting with Clinton and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Russia has blocked action against al-Assad at the United Nations, but some have speculated that Moscow may be considering a different approach. On Thursday, a top Russian politician said the Syrian government ""is not up to the task"" of doing its job and cannot ""fulfill its functions,"" the Interfax news agency reported. Russian State Duma Deputy Speaker Vladimir Vasiliev said Russia wanted to create conditions where security forces inside Syria would take the situation under control, but Russia's ""influence with the Syrian leadership has been limited."" The comments from a close ally of President Vladimir Putin came at a time when diplomats say Moscow, which has insisted there should be no ""regime change"" in Syria, now increasingly doubts that al-Assad can survive in power. Diplomatic efforts to help end the 21-month conflict, which opposition activists say has claimed more than 42,000 lives, have so far failed. At least 89 people died Thursday, most of them in Damascus and Aleppo, according to the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria. CNN cannot confirm claims by the government or the opposition because of government restrictions that prevent journalists from reporting freely within Syria. Clinton and Lavrov previously worked out a plan to try to end the fighting, but that plan ultimately stalled. That plan, negotiated in June in Geneva, proposed the creation of a transitional government along with al-Assad leaving office. But Russia later balked at any U.N. Security Council measure that would include sanctions or military action. Clinton insisted any U.N. resolution ""have teeth."" The United States has also expressed concerns about the increasing radicalization of some armed factions of the opposition and is moving toward declaring al-Nusra Front a terrorist organization. Such groups present a dilemma for the United States. Al-Nusra Front, officials say, has ruthless and effective fighters that are spearheading gains against al-Assad's weakening forces. Assad may be seeking asylum . But the stronger the radical groups become, the more the United States worries that the fighting -- not political efforts to find a solution -- will decide the outcome in Syria. As a result, Washington has been pushing the opposition to unite. That process is unfolding with the recent creation of the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces. Early next week, Clinton will travel to Marrakesh, Morocco, for a meeting of the Friends of the Syrian People, a gathering of countries that support the political transition. The Obama administration, while providing, for now, non-lethal assistance, is expected to take the first steps toward officially recognizing the National Coalition at that meeting. Clinton also reiterated Wednesday the strong U.S. position set out by President Barack Obama on Monday over any possible use by Syria of chemical weapons. She said the international community is sending a clear message to Damascus. ""Our concerns are that an increasingly desperate Assad regime might turn to chemical weapons or might lose control of them to one of the many groups that are now operating within Syria,"" she said. ""And so, as part of the absolute unity that we all have on this issue, we have sent an unmistakable message that this would cross a red line and those responsible would be held to account."" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on a visit to Baghdad Thursday that he had expressed his ""gravest concerns"" to Syria's government over any use of chemical weapons and had written directly to al-Assad. He warned that anyone responsible for the use of chemical weapons would face serious consequences. Ban is to meet with the head of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in Baghdad to discuss how it can work with the United Nations on the issue. Read more: Aleppo residents find little left . NATO foreign ministers agreed this week to a request by Turkey for Patriot missiles to be deployed along its border to bolster its air defenses against potential Syrian threats. Errant Syrian artillery shells struck the Turkish border town of Akcakale and killed five Turkish civilians in October. Early Thursday, the German Cabinet agreed to send Patriot missiles and up to 400 soldiers to Turkey to deter the Syrian civil war from spilling into the country. Germany's parliament will vote on the deployment next week, the foreign ministry said. In addition to Germany, the United States and Netherlands, both of which have Patriot capabilities, have signaled they would be willing to contribute missiles. ""Any deployment will be defensive only. It will in no way support a no-fly zone or any offensive operation,"" the NATO statement said. NATO's decision was made as the fears surfaced that the Assad regime might be preparing to use chemical weapons. ""The Syrian stockpiles of chemical weapons are a matter of great concern,"" NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said. ""We know that Syria possesses missiles. We know they have chemical weapons and, of course, they also have to be included in our calculations,"" he said. ""And this is also the reason why it is a matter of urgency to ensure effective defense and protection of our ally Turkey."" In the United States, Republican Sen. John McCain said Thursday that time may be running out. ""If true, these reports may mean that the United States and our allies are facing the prospect of an imminent use of weapons of mass destruction in Syria, and this may be the last warning we get,"" McCain said. ""The time for talking about what to do may now be coming to a close and we may instead be left with an awful and very difficult decision."" Opinion: Rape is shredding Syria's social fabric .

"(CNN) -- The National Rifle Association will sponsor the NASCAR Sprint Cup event in Texas on April 13, Texas Motor Speedway President Eddie Gossage announced Monday. The race will be called the NRA 500 and will be run during prime time. ""NRA members and NASCAR fans love their country and everything that is good and right about America. We salute our flag, volunteer in our churches and communities, cherish our families, and we love racing."" NRA Chief Executive Officer Wayne LaPierre said a video statement played for reporters at a news conference announcing the event. The sponsorship comes as the gun rights advocacy group has been ramping up its campaign against gun control initiatives in Washington. NRA promises new ads, blasts 'real consequences' of background checks . Just a few weeks ago, the NRA bought newspaper ads in five states and regional ads and online commercials on websites in 15 states. The NRA spent about $350,000 on that campaign, a source familiar with it told CNN. It's the first time the NRA has sponsored a race in NASCAR's top series. Last year, the organization sponsored a Nationwide Series race at Atlanta Motor Speedway. The race had been promoted as the Texas 500 after the track's deal with Samsung ended last year. ""The title sponsorship costs for a Sprint Cup series race vary greatly from track to track, with variables ranging from market size to attendance, TV ratings and inventory included in the sponsorship package,"" Mike Zizzo, spokesman for Texas Motor Speedway, said in an e-mail. NRA's enemies list: Most of America . The Sports Business Journal reported that Sprint Cup sponsorships typically sell for about $1 million per race. ""The NRA has been involved in the sport for several years and a partner of (track owner) Speedway Motorsports, Inc. for many years in various aspects, and this race entitlement is just another extension of that business relationship,"" Gossage said. The winners of races at the track are often given two revolvers and a cowboy hat while taking photographs in victory lane. The fastest qualifier is awarded a shotgun. Richard Childress, who owns several NASCAR teams, is a member of the NRA's board of directors. The Texas Motor Speedway has more than 190,000 seats. There will be another Sprint Cup event at the track in November, sponsored by AAA. Read more news on CNN.com .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The United States is involved in peace talks with the Taliban, Afghan President Hamid Karzai told a youth group in Kabul on Saturday. ""Peace negotiations with the Taliban and with other countrymen have been started,"" Karzai told reporters after his earlier announcement on state TV. ""Those who accept the constitution, freedom, democracy and development of Afghanistan can take part in this negotiation."" Representatives of the government and insurgents have been in touch, but there have been no high-level meetings, Karzai said. He added there was no specific agenda. A senior U.S. source said there were contacts but nothing serious or substantial enough to be considered negotiations. U.S. statements are typically restrained, the source said, plus, ""This is Karzai being Karzai."" The source could not be named because of the sensitivity of the subject. The U.S. State Department indicated it would support reconciliation talks in Afghanistan. ""We must help create conditions necessary to enable political settlement among the Afghan people,"" department spokeswoman Megan Mattson said. ""This includes reconciling those insurgents who are willing to renounce al Qaeda, forsake violence and adhere to the Afghan constitution."" The U.N. Security Council split a key sanctions list on al Qaeda and the Taliban on Friday with an eye toward reconciliation in Afghanistan. The move makes it easier to add and remove people and entities from the sanctions lists. The council also established specific criteria for having an individual delisted. The vote was unanimous. ""It sends a clear signal that now is the time for the Taliban to come forward and join the political process,"" Mark Lyall Grant, the British ambassador to the United Nations, told the council. At a news conference with Karzai earlier this month, outgoing U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates talked about making changes in Afghanistan. ""I believe that if we can hold on to the territory that has been recaptured from the Taliban between ourselves and the Afghan forces and perhaps expand that security, that we will be in a position toward the end of this year to perhaps have a successful opening with respect to reconciliation, or at least be in a position where we can say we've turned a corner here in Afghanistan,"" Gates said, referring to political reconciliation talks. Gates made the statement during his last visit to Afghanistan as defense secretary. Karzai awarded Gates the Wazir Akbar Khan medal, the highest governmental award.

"Washington (CNN) -- It has been said over and over again: The 2010 midterm is the anti-incumbent, anti-Washington and by virtue of their position in power, the anti-Democratic election. A sputtering economy, 9.6 percent national unemployment rate, housing crisis and little hope for a quick turnaround on the jobs front has forced Democrats on the defense heading into November. OK, that is an understatement. Democrats are under siege all across the country and are in deep danger of losing control of the House and if a massive wave develops on November 2, perhaps even the Senate. Fueled by a huge fundraising effort by the Republican Governors Association, the GOP is also in position to reclaim more than a half dozen governorships including in states that President Obama easily won in 2008 such as Iowa, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. The new CNN/Time/Opinion Research Corporation Polls offers data that shows Democrats running for Senate seats in four key states are in dire straits and a president with little juice to help propel them to victory. In all four of these states: Alaska, Arkansas, Florida and Ohio, Obama's job approval rating ranges from a low of 33 percent (Arkansas) to a high of 42 percent (Ohio). The anti-Washington, thus anti-Democratic, theme shines like a bright neon sign in each of these races. And the GOP's rubber stamp argument seems to be resonating with voters, whether it is true or not: Sending, say, Arkansas Sen. Blanche Lincoln back to Washington means she will be a rubber stamp for Obama. Lincoln, who stuck to her centrist views and beat back a strong primary challenge from her political left earlier this year, is trailing her GOP opponent, Rep. John Boozman, by 14 points. In Ohio, Democratic Senate nominee Lee Fisher is down 15 points to Republican Rob Portman. And in Florida, GOP Senate nominee Marco Rubio has a 26 point lead over Democrat Kendrick Meek in a three way race that also features Charlie Crist. Crist is running an independent bid for the Senate seat and trails Rubio by 14 points. (The National Republican Senatorial Committee is also making the claim to West Virginia voters that the popular Democratic Gov. Joe Manchin would be a rubber stamp for Obama if elected to the Senate). But the Democrats running for governor in three of four of these states surveyed by CNN/Time/ORC shows that these candidates are either competitive or leading in their individual races. Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe has a 27-point lead over his GOP rival Jim Keet; Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland is up one point over Republican opponent John Kasich; and in the race for Florida governor, Democrat Alex Sink trails Republican Rick Scott by three points, which is within the poll's 3.5 percent margin of error. So, I think it is fair to say -- outside of Alaska -- that Democratic incumbents and candidates in these three states are not being stuck in the same category as their Democratic counterparts running for Senate. That is not to say the national mood is not having a negative affect on these Democrats, it just hasn't been devastating. As for the CNN/Time/ORC Poll, I dug a little deeper into the survey and found these interesting data points: . Alaska: Lisa Murkowski obviously faces a difficult challenge in having her supporters correctly write-in her name on the ballot on November 2. The poll shows that Murkowski and GOP nominee Joe Miller are tied at 37 percent, with Democratic nominee Scott McAdams registering support at 23 percent. But when respondents were asked if they might choose another candidate if they think the write-in procedure is too complicated, 3 percent answered yes. So, take that 3 percent away from Murkowski's 37 percent and all of a sudden Miller is up three points. Murkowski is still within in the margin of error, but as CNN Polling Director Keating Holland noted ""in a tight race, this might be the difference between winning and losing."" Murkowski's greatest support comes from Anchorage and the Panhandle, while Miller wins Fairbanks and the Anchorage area when you expand it beyond the city limits. Arkansas: How troubling is this for Democrat Blanche Lincoln? She is losing the woman vote to Republican John Boozman by eight points. She performs strongest in the east, while Boozman wins every other region of the state. Florida: Republican Marco Rubio is winning independents by four points over Charlie Crist, who is running an independent bid. Rubio's lead is within the 6 percent margin of error. Rubio is also winning every corner of the state except southern Florida/Miami area where Crist holds a modest lead over the Republican nominee and the Democratic nominee Kendrick Meek. In the governor's race, Democrat Alex Sink is losing every region to Republican Rick Scott, but is crushing him in the southern Florida/Miami area. Sink, too, has soft support with women. She leads Scott by five points with women voters, but that is within the 5 percent margin of error for that specific question. Ohio: In the Senate contest, Democrat Lee Fisher is losing to Republican Rob Portman among men and woman and in every age category. Geographically, Fisher leads Portman in the Cleveland area by eight points, but that is within the 8.5 percent margin of error. Portman is winning in every other part of the state. As for the competitive governor's race, Ted Strickland is winning women, while John Kasich wins men. Strickland has a 15-point lead over Kasich with voters who earn less than $50,000, while Kasich has an 11-point lead over Strickland with voters who earn more than $50,000. Kasich has an 11-point lead over Strickland with independents. As for geographic regions, Strickland is leading in the Cleveland area and the central part of the state (the latter is within the margin of error), while Kasich is carrying Cincinnati/Dayton and has a slight lead in Columbus. In the industrial north, the two candidates are dead even.","Democrats running for Senate seats in four key states are in dire straits .

"(CNN) -- Fuel-saving gas-electric hybrid and all-electric cars and trucks powered by sizable battery packs and high voltage motors could present a new kind of danger at serious accident scenes, according to an industry group. A report by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) highlighted risks to first responders and tow operators from potential electric shock from damaged systems not disengaged during or immediately after a crash. ""As electric vehicles enter the marketplace in greater numbers, it's an appropriate time to recognize best practices that facilitate a safe response when these vehicles are in an accident,"" said Todd Mackintosh, chairman of the SAE technical committee that issued the report earlier this month. The group recommended automakers install switches that would kill battery power in the event of an accident. The location of those switches should be standardized for safety. Another recommendation would create a guide for emergency workers, something Mackintosh called a ""cheat sheet for first responders."" It would quickly identify the location of high-voltage components allowing them to be disabled. Tow truck drivers also need better information and training on how to handle hybrids and electric vehicles without receiving an unexpected jolt, the report said. More than 435,000 battery powered electric and hybrid electric vehicles were sold in the United States this year, an increase of 53%, compared to 2011 sales numbers, according to the Electric Drive Transportation Association. In May, auto industry officials and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Energy Department discussed potential dangers faced by first responders from electrical charges produced by hybrid and electric cars. NHTSA later issued interim guidance for consumers, emergency responders and tow truck operators to increase awareness about specific dangers. Dangers can be reduced if responders have easy access to battery packs and if auto manufacturers create common disconnect locations in all hybrid and electric vehicles, NHTSA said. Automakers are getting the message out to drivers and responders. Nissan places the battery pack of its LEAF all-electric car in a steel case. The Japanese automaker also designed the battery pack to sense a crash and disable its electrical charge when involved in an accident. Ford has published a guide for first responders encountering its Focus EV involved in accidents. The Focus EV includes what Ford calls ""Electric Badges,"" which are clearly marked logos on the doors and trunk lid to warn responders of possible electric shock. Cables wrapped in orange high-voltage warning sleeves are located under the hood of the Focus EV. General Motors, maker of the Chevy Volt, is also helping to prepare fire service and other first responders. Moreover, GM took steps to better protect the Volt battery pack following a fire that flared after a crash test in 2011. NHTSA found no defect with the lithium-ion battery system nor were any real world crash-fires ever reported. But the case highlighted potential safety concerns for first responders.","Batteries of hybrid and electric cars could present safety risk in crashes, group says .

"(CNN) -- A deadly attack Wednesday delivered the harshest blow yet to President Bashar al-Assad's regime, taking the bloodshed into his inner circle. Jordan's king calls Syria attack 'a tremendous blow' to al-Assad regime . Three top officials were killed and a number of others were wounded in an explosion at a national security building in Damascus, state TV reported. The attack came after several days of violence in the capital. At least 189 people were killed across the country on Wednesday, including 37 in Damascus and 69 in its suburbs, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. The officials killed were Defense Minister Dawood Rajiha; Deputy Defense Minister Assef Shawkat -- al-Assad's brother-in-law; and Hasan Turkmani, al-Assad's security adviser and assistant vice president, state TV reported. Interior Minister Ibrahim al-Shaar was among those injured in the blast, state TV said, adding that he ""is in good health and that his condition is stable."" Getting to know Syria's first family . The attack, which occurred during a meeting of ministers and security officials, was coordinated by rebel brigades in Damascus, said the deputy head of the opposition Free Syrian Army, Col. Malek al-Kurdi. The government described it as a suicide bombing. But al-Kurdi said a remote control was used to detonate an explosive device that had been planted inside the meeting room. Al-Assad quickly named Gen. Fahd Jassem al-Freij as defense minister, state-run news agency SANA said. State-run SANA said the government has killed or captured a ""large number"" of terrorist infiltrators in Damascus and inflicted ""heavy losses"" on terrorists in Homs and Idlib. Video from a Damascus suburb showed Syrians rejoicing after news spread of the bombing. Soon after, the pro-government Shabiha militia took to the streets, attacking with knives, shooting and saying, ""This is retribution for what you have done,"" according to an opposition activist in Damascus, who is going by the name Lena to protect her identity. There were bodies in the streets around the Yarmouk, a Palestinian refugee camp, and people were too afraid to collect them, Lena said. ""The people are really scared,"" she said, adding that mosques were blaring the messages ""Stay in your homes"" and ""God is great."" A Damascus resident said shootings occurred in Baghdad Street, a major road that includes branch offices of state security agencies. In the neighborhood of Medan, where violence has raged in recent days, Free Syrian Army fighters ""launched their biggest attack yet all over Damascus, in 17 points,"" said Abo Abdo, a rebel fighter. They were working to ""disperse the regime's forces all over the capital,"" he said. Syria, on the official Syrian Arab News Agency, said its armed forces ""chased down terrorists who infiltrated"" Medan, and ""killed and arrested a large number of them. The military units also chased down terrorists who terrorized some families in the neighborhoods of al-Qaboun and Tishreen and forced them to leave their homes."" With the Syrian government restricting foreign journalists from gaining access to the country, CNN cannot independently confirm reports of violence or details about the attack. The bombing took place in a building in Rawda Square, near al-Assad's home and the U.S. Embassy, which suspended its operations in February. Security officials and government spies have had a heavy presence in the area. The bombing's repercussions spread from the capital of Syria to the capital of Egypt, where clashes erupted Wednesday between the Egyptian police and hundreds of protesters outside the Syrian Embassy. Some of them were chanting, ""Down, Down, Bashar al-Assad!"" ""We only wanted to remove the flag and replace it by the independence flag, but the Egyptian riot police started beating us so we pelted them with rocks,"" said Ahmed H. Aggour, an organizer of the protest in Cairo. ""Next thing you know they fired an incredible amount of tear gas, several canisters landed on the British Embassy nearby."" He added, ""We want people in Syria to see how we are supporting their cause here in Egypt."" Most of the protesters were Egyptian, Tarek Shalaby, an Egyptian activist and web designer at the scene. Alla Mahmoud, a spokesman from the Interior Ministry, told CNN that 15 protesters were arrested. Some suffered minor injuries, from excessive inhalation of tear gas to bruises. Meanwhile, U.S. President Obama called Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday to discuss the Syrian situation, the White House said. ""They noted the differences our governments have had on Syria, but agreed to have their teams continue to work toward a solution,"" it said. A planned Security Council vote on a draft resolution on Syria was delayed at the request of Kofi Annan, joint envoy to Syria for the United Nations and the Arab League, until 10 a.m. Thursday, diplomats said. Annan, who met Tuesday with Putin in Moscow, earlier this year put forward a peace plan that has failed to stop the violence. Western countries are pushing for a resolution that threatens sanctions against al-Assad's regime if government forces don't stop attacks. That draft also calls for renewing the 300-member U.N. observer mission for 45 days. The observers' work has been suspended because of violence. Throughout Syria's 16-month crisis, Russia has opposed any international effort that would blame, punish or change the leadership of the Syrian government. Russia -- along with China -- has vetoed two previous draft resolutions in the U.N. Security Council, leading to accusations that Russia is protecting the Syrian regime. Russia, meanwhile, has put forth its own draft, which ""strongly urges all parties in Syria to cease immediately all armed violence in all its forms."" The Russian draft also calls for renewing the U.N. observer mission for three months. At the United Nations, German Ambassador Peter Wittig said Wednesday's events in Damascus ""underline as clearly as never before that the Security Council now has to act. It has to send out a strong signal to the Syrian regime to stop the use of heavy weapons. We want to give the Annan plan, which we all support in the council, some teeth -- and that's why we should adopt a resolution with the sanctions threat."" In Amman, Jordan, King Abdullah said the situation in Syria is nearing an all-out civil war. ""In other words, it's getting very, very messy,"" he said. ""When you get full-out civil war, there is no coming back from the abyss."" Next for Syria: Showdown or stalemate? The attack represents ""a massive psychological blow to the regime"" and will accelerate al-Assad's ""demise,"" predicted Anthony Skinner, an analyst with Maplecroft, a think tank that provides risk assessments on global business. It could suggest that ""the regime itself is crumbling,"" said Rime Allaf, an analyst with Chatham House, a think tank focusing on international affairs. Events in Syria show ""a real escalation in fighting,"" said U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. It ""tells us that this is a situation that is rapidly spinning out of control, and for that reason it's extremely important that the international community, working with other countries that have concerns in that area, have to bring maximum pressure on Assad to do what's right, and to step down and to allow for that peaceful transition,"" Panetta said. The U.S. government announced Wednesday a new round of sanctions against members of the Syrian government. Timeline: How the horror has unfolded . Syrian Information Minister Omran al-Zubi, speaking on state TV, vowed that those behind the attack will be held accountable. He insisted that those trying to divide the army are failing. ""This army has not been divided,"" he said. But increasing numbers of officials in the Syrian military have defected in recent days. Two brigadier generals fled overnight to Turkey, bringing the number of Syrian generals in Turkey to 20, a Turkish Foreign Ministry official said. Rajiha, one of those killed Wednesday, was a member of the country's minority Christian community. who was named by the U.S. Treasury in sanctions this year. U.S. citizens were prohibited from engaging in transactions with him and other officials amid what the U.S. government called Syria's ""continued use of violence against its people."" In 2006, the Treasury named Shawkat -- then Syria's director of military intelligence -- in an executive order, freezing his assets and prohibiting U.S. citizens from engaging in transactions with him. At the time, the U.S. government called Shawkat ""a key architect of Syria's domination of Lebanon, as well as a fundamental contributor to Syria's long-standing policy to foment terrorism against Israel."" What we need to know about Syria . Days ago, Nawaf al-Fares, the former Syrian ambassador to Iraq who has become the country's highest-level diplomatic defector, told CNN that Shawkat had run an al Qaeda in Iraq training camp. A U.S. official said al-Fares' claim was ""broadly consistent with our understanding"" of the Syrian regime's cooperation with al Qaeda ""elements."" But the Syrian regime has repeatedly denied involvement in terrorist activities -- and has blamed the violence of the past 16 months on ""armed terrorist groups."" Dark images of horror and despair smuggled out of Syria . Syria's al Qaeda boomerang . Since the crisis began in March 2011, the United Nations estimates, more than 10,000 people have been killed in the violence; the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria estimates that more than 16,000 have died. Defector: 'The battle for Damascus is coming' CNN's Salma Abdelaziz, Ivan Watson, Arwa Damon, Amir Ahmed, Holly Yan, Richard Roth, Brian Walker and Joe Sterling and journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report.","The U.N.

"Washington (CNN) -- Barack Obama and Mitt Romney wasted little time rushing to the cameras when the Supreme Court narrowly upheld the president's sweeping health care reform law. Their remarks after the June ruling were a contrast of competing rhetoric over a contentious piece of legislation, and a prism into how each candidate hopes to quietly change the makeup of the federal courts. ""Americans are probably paying much more attention to the economy than the Supreme Court,"" said Thomas Goldstein, a top appellate attorney and SCOTUSblog.com publisher. ""But they should be thinking about presidential court appointments, because they'll make a big difference in the future of the law. You think about things like same-sex marriage, affirmative action, voting rights -- all of these are issues that have very different ideological components to them, and the more conservative justices definitely have a different view,"" he said. But the landmark health care ruling had exactly zero impact on the presidential race at the time as a CNN/ORC poll just days later showed virtually no change in opinions on public attitudes toward Obama or Romney. It is an unusual dynamic: the Supreme Court traditionally rates near the bottom when voters are asked to list the issues most important to them, but the high-profile issues the justices decide -- hot-button topics like health care, abortion, economic and tax reforms -- remain of consistent concern to the electorate. Toobin: Why are candidates silent on Supreme Court? The high court is poised to maintain a period of bench stability for at least a couple more years, barring an unexpected illness or personal crisis. This, after four court vacancies from 2005-2010 brought on Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. Still, many court watchers anticipate the man sitting in the Oval Office through 2016 could name at least one and perhaps as many as three members to the Supreme Court. And the recent health care decision may have raised the already high stakes on the makeup of the federal bench at large. Big cases await Supreme Court's 2012-13 term . ""Even more Americans are watching who is on the Supreme Court this election cycle, more so perhaps they have in the past, because there's a clear connection between who is on the court and how that affects your daily life,"" said Elizabeth Wydra, chief counsel of the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center. ""The Supreme Court and its ideological divide is really placing the Constitution and the country in many ways at a crossroads."" Judicial philosophy . Obama has touted his successful nominations of Sotomayor and Kagan, saying they fit his overall philosophy of what a good judge should be. He has been criticized in the past for using ""empathy"" as a key criterion to nominate judges. Supreme Court possibilities if Obama is reelected . ""I think that's why he's backed off from talking about it, because ultimately the 'empathy' standard turns a court more into identity politics,"" said Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative legal advocacy group. ""Ultimately, that's actually not what Americans want. We don't want judges that are going to vote their interest group. We want judges who are going to vote with the Constitution: what they think is the correct legal and constitutional result. And that is what Governor Romney has been emphasizing,"" Severino said. The president's has not talked much about the high court this election year, but he has had an uneasy relationship with its conservative majority. Romney has said, if elected, he would ""nominate judges in the mold of Chief Justice [John] Roberts."" But Romney told CBS News this past summer that Roberts made ""political considerations"" in authoring the health care ruling. The Republican nominee supplemented his thoughts on the kinds of judges he would appoint: ""I'd look for individuals who have the intelligence and believe in following the Constitution."" Supreme Court possibilities if Romney is elected . Wydra said the decision on health care ""was sort of a microcosm of the philosophies that are frankly at a crossroads"" at the court. ""And if President Obama gets to nominate one or more justices in his next term, that could solidify the approach of the majority in the Affordable Care Act, which gives the national government the power to solve national problems."" Unofficial favorites . A dynamic California politician and a low-key Washington lawyer have emerged as unofficial favorites for any high court vacancy in the next four years. CNN talked with nearly a dozen sources close to both the Romney and Obama campaigns. For the president's backers, one name is repeatedly mentioned: Kamala Harris, the Golden State's elected attorney general. At 48, the part Asian, part African-American woman has been praised for her political savvy, ethnic background, telegenic personality, law enforcement credentials, and early support of Obama's 2008 candidacy. Navarrette: Why Latinos are key to election . ""If Justice [Ruth Bader] Ginsburg does retire, or President Obama gets another appointment, I do think Kamala Harris is the most likely to be put on,"" said Goldstein, who generated buzz when he analyzed Harris at length eight months ago in his well-respected legal blog. ""The California attorney general has the most political experience, which is really missing on the court right now. She's diverse, she's young -- I think kind of a female Barack Obama in some sense."" Harris declined to speculate about a possible move to Washington. For Romney, his legal advisers point to Paul Clement, the former U.S. solicitor general, as the kind of reliable, articulate conservative justice they think the Republican nominee would like. Despite no judicial experience, the quietly self-assured 46-year-old Iowa native has earned praise as a dazzling attorney arguing a range of big cases before the high court-- including health care and immigration reform. Some conservative legal advocates want more assurances of Clement's conservative bona fides, hoping he and other young Republican lawyers would first be named to a federal appeals court seat -- a stepping stone perhaps to the high court. ""Clearly he's a brilliant man. He's clearly a wonderful [oral] advocate,"" said Severino. ""But I think particularly for a Supreme Court spot, you're going to want to see somebody who has judicial experience, to see how they actually perform as a judge. ... But certainly, I could see him being in a lower court position so that he would have the chance to build that experience and that record and then be in a place further down the line when another opening comes up."" Clement was modest about the speculation. ""I think service on the bench is a great form of public service; I wouldn't want to necessarily rule it out,"" he told CNN exclusively in March. ""On the other hand, I'm a big believer in that you sort of have to do the job that you currently have and you can't really worry about what you might do next."" A number of other potential top Romney picks are already relatively young federal judges, thanks to a deep conservative bench named by President George W. Bush, who made those judicial choices a top priority. Next to retire . As for which justice would be next to retire, that remains one of the last best-kept secrets. Ginsburg, who turns 80 next March, is the oldest, and has previous health problems. But she has publicly stated her desire to stay on the court for a few more years if possible. If Obama is re-elected and if Ginsburg were to step down, the balance on the power on the court would likely not shift: the president would ostensibly be replacing one liberal with another. Conservative Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy are both 76, and their nominated replacements would be more closely scrutinized and debated, especially if Obama were to be the one making one or both choices. Justice Stephen Breyer, a liberal, turned 74 last month. Justice Clarence Thomas is 64, Alito is 62, while Roberts, Sotomayor, and Kagan are all in their 50s. Record number of justices attends Red Mass .","Health care ruling had exactly zero impact on the presidential race at the time .

"(CNN) -- London may be the center of attention this summer, but venture beyond the Olympic Stadium and you'll find the real British Isles, a world of ancient thatched cottages, monumental castles, elegant university towns and jagged peaks. You won't have to travel far to see why the British landscape so inspired the Romantic poets, why A-listers flee the city for tiny medieval villages and why a pint in a pub selling hammers and nails tastes finer than any other on Earth. England: The Cotswolds . For a slice of picture-postcard England, the Cotswolds make an easy excursion from London but feel half a world away. The wool trade boomed in these rolling hills in medieval times and today the region is littered with achingly pretty villages, elegant old mansions, graceful churches and atmospheric pubs, most largely unchanged for centuries. Wander between rows of honey-colored almshouses and thatched cottages, browse the antiques shops or stop for a cream tea and you'll feel transported back in time. Away from the tourists in Burford and Broadway you'll find quieter spots such as Chipping Campden with its long curving high street. Leading members of the arts and crafts movement were so enamored by the town they made it their home in the early 20th century, and their founder, William Morris, settled in nearby Kelmscott in a gloriously unassuming riverside mansion. Another hidden gem, Painswick, lies to the west with its elegant rows of medieval terraced housing and wonderful rococo gardens. For the best pint, head to the Falkland Arms in Great Tew, a place so special I barely wish to share it. England: Cambridge . Soaked in history and riddled with historic buildings, the university town of Cambridge exudes a dreamy air of Old World sophistication. The august colleges, hushed quadrangles, manicured lawns and cobbled laneways give way to ""The Backs,"" a stretch of picturesque gardens bordering the meandering River Cam. Cambridge is an exclusive kind of place where gowned cyclists ply the streets and the academic elite debate life-changing questions in dimly lit pubs. You can visit many of the University's 31 colleges, but don't miss the extraordinary King's College Chapel. Its mesmerizing fan-vaulted ceiling is best appreciated during Evensong when you can listen to the college's celebrated choir as you ponder your place in the universe. Art lovers should follow up the grand neoclassical Fitzwilliam Museum with the unassuming Kettle's Yard, a treasure trove of 20th-century art, ceramics and sculpture. For the quintessential Cambridge experience, hop on a chauffeur-driven punt to the sleepy village of Grantchester. Once a favorite haunt of the influential Bloomsbury Group of writers, intellectuals and artists, this is the place for afternoon tea at the tranquil Orchard Tea Garden. From Cambridge, it's a short trip north to the charming town of Ely and its magnificent cathedral, whose soaring towers dominate the flat marshy fenland that surrounds the town. England: Lake District . England's largest protected outdoor playground, the Lake District National Park, is a wild and winsome place full of craggy peaks, glittering lakes and moody fells. For walkers and climbers, there's a wealth of routes from which to choose. Try the Langdale Pikes, a chain of rugged hills offering spectacular views or for something less taxing, the Borger Dalr route. The region provided ample inspiration for some of England's finest writers and poets, and today you can follow the William Wordsworth trail from his childhood home in Cockermouth to tiny Dove Cottage in Grasmere, and the more tranquil Rydal Mount in Ambleside, where you can sit in the house where he once tested his verse. Beatrix Potter's bucolic 17th-century farmhouse, Hill Top, is also here and scenes straight from her books lie around every corner. Many of the main sights get extremely busy, as do cruises on the largest lake, Windermere. Instead head for Coniston Water, where a trip on the restored 19th-century Steam Yacht Gondola offers captivating views of the surrounding hills and drops you off at Brantwood, the fascinating former home of John Ruskin, Victorian art critic, philosopher and philanthropist. Scotland: The Highlands and Islands . Big skies, craggy mountains, steely-gray lochs and cascading falls, the majestic, wild expanses of the Scottish Highlands are every bit as romantic as their celluloid reputation. The grand vistas, lonesome castles and isolated pubs where you can warm yourself by a peat fire, sip a dram of whisky and put the world to right are all just waiting to be explored. You can hike, bike, ski and fish, feast on seafood, dance a jig or even toss a caber (a large wooden pole thrown as a test of strength during the traditional Highland Games). The mercurial landscape of the Cairngorms National Park makes an excellent place to start. Sculpted by glaciers and home to golden eagles, wildcats and red deer, the ancient forests and bleak moorland here are simply spectacular. For pure romance, head to Eilean Donan Castle. Perched on a rocky islet on the edge of Loch Duich, it is one of Scotland's most iconic sights. Nearby is the glorious Isle of Skye or head for the Hebrides to marvel at the mysterious standing stones at Callanish and dip your toes in the azure waters off Lewis and Harris. Possibly Scotland's most spectacular setting though is on far-flung Orkney, where you'll find the wonderfully preserved Skara Brae. The village, which predates the Egyptian pyramids, remains a testament to the ingenuity of the people of the day. Wales: Snowdonia and North Wales . North Wales is one of the country's most spectacular and traditional regions. Its high mountains and rough terrain deterred waves of invaders over the years, and its finest landscapes are protected as part of Snowdonia National Park. Snow-capped mountains, tumbling rivers, Stone Age burial chambers and Roman forts all lurk here. It's an excellent spot for gentle hiking or challenging climbs but rather than tackle the busy Mount Snowdon, head instead for Cader Idris, a legendary peak said to be an entrance to the underworld. Capel Curig makes a good base for walkers and climbers, but history buffs should head to one of the magnificent medieval castles that dot the area. The intimidating fortresses at Harlech, Beaumaris, Conwy and Caernarfon jointly form a UNESCO World Heritage Site and are intriguing places to explore. Alternatively, catch the dramatic Ffestiniog Railway to the slate mines at Blaenau Ffestiniog to learn about the human side of Wales' industrial heritage. A short trip south and you enter an entirely different world at the whimsical Italianate village of Portmeirion. Set on a tranquil peninsula, this bizarre enclave was the brainchild of Welsh architect Sir Bertram Clough Williams-Ellis. Ireland: Kerry . Gorgeously green and incredibly friendly, the lush scenery and unique atmosphere of Kerry have made it one of Ireland's most popular regions. Here, emerald forests drip with moss, dramatic peaks lie shrouded in mist and water trickles everywhere. Head out from the tourist honeypot of Killarney around the Ring of Kerry with its glorious views, sandy beaches and ancient ruins. It's a busy route in summer and the best way to leave the crowds behind is to take a trip to the early Christian monastery of Skellig Michael. Seven miles offshore and up 600 steep steps, you'll find the 6th-century beehive huts of what was once one of Europe's most remote religious communities. The sense of isolation here is humbling, and the views are nothing short of spectacular. Alternatively, you could take a trip in a pony and trap across the beautiful Gap of Dunloe which is flanked by Ireland's highest mountains, the McGillycuddy's Reeks. Whatever you do, don't miss the Dingle Peninsula with its vast stretch of golden sand at Inch, scenic Conor Pass and beguiling eponymous town where you can down a pint in the wonderfully atmospheric Dick Mack's pub/hardware store. Northern Ireland: the Causeway Coast . Northern Ireland's troubled reputation has been hard to shake off, but wander this way and you'll be rewarded with the peace and tranquility of a place the world has yet to discover. Beyond Belfast's black taxi tours, urban regeneration and stunning new Titanic experience, the biggest draw is the otherworldly Giant's Causeway. Here, more than 38,000 interlocking basalt columns form a patchwork of stepping stones that stretch out into the sea. This extraordinary landscape marks the start of the legendary Finn McCool's bridge to Scotland, although a rival theory suggests it's merely a geological phenomenon formed 50 million to 60 million years ago. From here the beautiful Causeway Coast stretches in both directions. Head east to reach Carrick-a-Rede, where a narrow swaying rope bridge connects the mainland to a little island traditionally known for its salmon fishing, or go west to the dramatic ruins of Dunluce Castle. Perched on a clifftop, the fortress partly collapsed into the sea in 1639 and today a narrow bridge forges the gap between the main castle and its courtyard. Alternatively, you could just hop on the historic train line to Bushmills, where you'll find the world's oldest legal distillery.","In the Cotswolds, visit elegant mansions, graceful churches and atmospheric pubs .

"Seffner, Florida (CNN) -- Authorities in Florida gave up the search Saturday for a man presumed dead after a sinkhole opened beneath the bedroom of his family's suburban Tampa home, swallowing him up. The effort to recover the body of Jeff Bush had resumed earlier in the day after authorities stopped operations overnight, saying the hole was still expanding and the house could collapse at any time. ""We just have not been able to locate Mr. Bush and so for that reason the rescue effort is being discontinued,"" Mike Merrill, county administrator for Hillsborough County, told reporters Saturday evening. ""At this point, it's really not possible to recover the body."" Merrill said the next phase in the effort would be demolition of the family's home, which is scheduled to begin Sunday and could take a couple of days. He stressed that workers were dealing with a ""very unusual sinkhole"" -- deep, wide and extremely unstable. ""We've done everything we believe that we can. We wish we could have done more,"" Merrill said. The sinkhole was between 50 and 60 feet deep, he said. The terror for the Bush family began Thursday night, as everybody in the blue, one-story, 1970s-era home in Seffner was going to bed. There was a deafening noise. ""I ran toward my brother's bedroom because I heard my brother scream,"" Jeremy Bush, Jeff Bush's brother, told CNN's ""AC360."" Sinkholes common, costly, sometimes deadly . ""Everything was gone. My brother's bed, my brother's dresser, my brother's TV. My brother was gone."" Bush frantically tried to rescue his brother, by standing in the hole and digging at the rubble with a shovel until police arrived and pulled him out, saying the floor was still collapsing. ""I couldn't get him out. I tried so hard. I tried everything I could,"" he said through tears. ""I could swear I heard him calling out."" The terror of those moments can be heard in a recording of the 911 call in the moments after the sinkhole opened up. ""The house just fell through,"" a female voice says on the recording released Friday by the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office. The woman asks for an ambulance and the police. ""The bedroom floor just collapsed, and my brother-in-law is in there. He's underneath the house,"" she says. Jeremy Bush and four other people, including a 2-year-old child, were uninjured. After officials called off the search for his brother Saturday, Jeremy Bush spoke to Bay News 9. ""It's very hard. It's not just I lost my brother. They're so many memories in this house,"" he told the CNN affiliate. ""I don't know what we're going to do."" Nearby homes were evacuated Friday as a precaution. The sinkhole compromised a house next door to the Bush home, fire department spokesman Ronnie Rivera said. That home wasn't damaged as of Saturday morning, but the family that lives there was given up to 30 minutes to remove some belongings before abandoning the premises, he said. Merrill said residents on either side of the Bush home were allowed to go into their houses a short time to retrieve what they could. Sinkholes are common in the state, according to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. The state lies on bedrock made of limestone or other carbonate rock that can be eaten away by acidic groundwater, forming voids that collapse when the rock can no longer support the weight of what's above it. Hillsborough County, on Florida's west coast, is part of an area known as ""sinkhole alley"" that accounts for two-thirds of the sinkhole-related insurance claims in the state, according to a Florida state Senate Insurance and Banking Committee report. John Zarrella reported from Seffner, Florida and Dana Ford reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter, Jake Carpenter, Brian Carberry, Elwyn Lopez, Nick Valencia and Tina Burnside contributed to this report.","NEW: Demolition work is set to begin Sunday, could take a couple of days .

"(CNN) -- On Oyu Tolgoi -- ""Turquoise Hill"" -- the biggest business venture in Mongolia is taking shape. The copper resources aren't new to locals -- after all, for thousands of years locals dug out copper to melt down into things like arrowheads, CNN's Stan Grant reports. But the massive Gobi Desert copper and gold mine -- a joint venture with foreign mining conglomerates Ivanhoe and Rio Tinto -- is expected to account for one-third of the nation's total economic output by 2020 and boost the average earnings of Mongolia by 60%. The numbers are staggering. The development phase runs to nearly $5 billion. The mine is projected to produce to 450,000 tons of copper and more than 300,000 ounces of gold. Developers claim there's enough here to mine for the next 50 years or more. Yet it's placing stress on an ancient nomadic way of life. Many locals they're worried the mine will drain all the water, although mine owners say Oyu Tolgoi has a separate underground source. There is also stress on animal herds and available land. Says one nomadic herder: ""At the moment it's impossible to graze our herd near the mine. Officials might say it is only 10-kilometer limit, but because of the traffic and dust you don't see any herds within 20 or 30 kilometers."" Other herders, like Myagmarjav, say they are benefiting from extra money for his wife and children through part-time work at the mine. ""We think we can work at the mine and take care of our herds. My three children will get a chance to go to school and have a better education,"" he says.","Mongolia's biggest copper and gold mine excavating large area of Gobi Desert .

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- The Japanese government stepped in Monday to weaken the yen, after it climbed to a post-World War II high against the dollar. Finance Minister Jun Assume said Japan intervened unilaterally at 10:25 a.m. It was the third intervention this year. ""Foreign exchange rates should reflect the real economy and fluctuate within the range of common sense. Otherwise it will distort the real economy,"" Azumi said. ""I decided it (the intervention) this morning as I cannot tolerate such appreciation."" The yen went up to the post-war high of 75.32 per dollar early Monday. The intervention immediately sent it tumbling to 79 per dollar. The government is worried that a strengthened yen will impact its economy, which relies heavily on exports. The country has only now begun to recover from the devastating aftereffects of a March 11 earthquake and tsunami. ""The yen's appreciation might close down factories and I cannot tolerate it,"" Azumi said. For every 1 yen appreciation against the dollar, Toyota, the car manufacturer, loses 30 billion yen ($380 million) in profits. The stock market, however, lost the upward momentum after an initial 100-point gain as some analysts expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of the intervention. ""The question is how long will the effect of the intervention continue,"" said Toshihiko Matsuno, a senior strategist of SMBC Friend Securities. ""The market is looking at the past examples. If this is a one-time only, the effect would be limited. It all depends how far the government is ready to intervene. It's a battle between the market and the government.""","Azumi: ""Foreign exchange rates should reflect the real economy""

"Paris, France (CNN) -- A new operation will begin next year to find the debris of Air France Flight 447, which mysteriously crashed into the southern Atlantic Ocean last year, French officials said. The search will begin in February and will be the fourth search for debris from the Airbus A330-200, which crashed while flying from Rio de Janeiro to Paris on June 1, 2009. All 228 people on board were killed. Investigators have not yet established what caused the crash, and large parts of the plane -- including both flight recorders -- have never been found, despite an extensive search operation that included a French navy submarine. France's air accident investigation agency, the BEA, will give details of the searches that will take place in the coming weeks in a meeting with families of the victims, the French Transport Ministry said. The Air France plane went down in stormy weather, and most of the bodies were never recovered. The plane's flight data recorder remains missing in the ocean, according to Air France. Studies of the debris and bodies that were found led the BEA to conclude the plane hit the water belly first, essentially intact. Oxygen masks were not deployed, indicating that the cabin did not depressurize, the BEA revealed in a report last year. Automated messages sent from the plane in the minutes before the crash showed there were problems measuring air speed, the investigators said, though they said that alone was not enough to cause the disaster. The area where the plane went down is far out in the Atlantic -- two to four days for ships to reach from the nearest ports in Brazil or Senegal in west Africa. The underwater terrain is rough with underwater mountains and valleys, the BEA said.","The flight crashed June 1, 2009 in the Atlantic Ocean .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Qantas has agreed a 10-year partnership with Emirates, as it seeks to revitalize its ailing international business. As part of the deal, the Australian carrier will transfer its hub for European flights from Singapore to Dubai from April next year -- subject to regulatory approval. Qantas said its daily Airbus A380 services to London from Melbourne and Sydney will transit via Dubai's Terminal 3, the world's only purpose-built A380 terminal. More: 10 of the world's top airport lounges . ""This is a partnership of independent peers, based on shared standards and aspirations,"" said Qantas CEO Alan Joyce at a joint press conference with Emirates President, Tim Clark, in Sydney Thursday. ""We have agreed to join forces to give our customers the most comprehensive premium travel experience on the planet. ""We will be poised to deliver the best in networks, frequencies, lounges, loyalty programs and customer experience."" He added that the deal would not involve equity investment on either side. Joyce said the new partnership would benefit its frequent flyers in particular, with the airlines offering reciprocal access to tier status benefits, including end-to-end recognition of customers, lounge access and priority check-in and boarding. The deal comes at a time when the Australian carrier's international business continues to hemorrhage money. Earlier this month Qantas announced its first annual loss since being privatized in 1995 -- $256 million for the year to June 30. It also scrapped an order worth $8.5 billion for 35 Boeing 787 ""Dreamliner"" jets, as it battles the effects of soaring fuel prices and industrial action. Emirates, which has itself experienced the crippling effects of rising fuel costs, also welcomed the deal. ""The time was right for developing a long term, future forward partnership with Qantas, the iconic Australian airline,"" Clark said. ""Since our first flights began in 1996, Australia has long been a popular destination for Emirates leisure and business travelers, making it one of the top three destinations in our network. ""By establishing this partnership we are providing our passengers with additional connectivity in Australia and the region and the ability to utilize enhanced frequent flyer benefits, and have access to premium lounges for an exceptional travel experience,"" he added.

"(CNN) -- Four days, 12 stages, 175 acts, 700 acres of land -- the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival is thriving in its tenth year. Having been deemed America's Glastonbury by the music industry -- the highest accolade in the festival world -- Bonnaroo will attract more than 80,000 people to Manchester, Tennessee, beginning Thursday. The small city, between Nashville and Chattanooga, has been home to the festival since its summer 2002 debut. It's hard to believe the all-encompassing music festival came to be from an office in a New Orleans dive bar called Snake and Jake's. ""Very humble beginnings,"" Bonnaroo and Superfly Presents co-founder Jonathan Mayers said. Since then, the festival has evolved into a complete musical experience: Drawing from indie rock, hip-hop, jazz, bluegrass and more, today, a more mainstream Bonnaroo continues to honor the spirit the festival was founded on a decade ago, Mayers added. Jessica Robertson, the managing editor of MTVHive.com, says Superfly and AC Entertainment, the production and marketing teams behind Bonnaroo, achieve the perfect balance by featuring headliners like Eminem and Bonnaroo veteran Widespread Panic alongside jam bands like String Cheese Incident and the legendary classic rockers that make up Buffalo Springfield. Some people might criticize the mainstream shift, but, Mayers says, ""If we just kept doing the same thing, we probably wouldn't be relevant right now."" And with tickets costing about $240, it's important that Bonnaroo maintain its relevance -- especially in a time when people are wary of paying full price for individual shows. ""So much music today is experienced on a computer screen that it's really great to get out and experience it,"" Robertson said. People are used to listening to an eclectic mix of artists and styles on their portable media players, which is why the musical sampling that Bonnaroo offers is so appreciated. In addition to featuring different types of music and countless activities -- from yoga classes to the use of a 175-foot-long inflatable water slide -- festivals are considered to be a great value for the average concert-goer. ""Festivals have been one of the few bright spots in the music industry in the past few years,"" said Doree Shafrir, RollingStone.com's senior editor. With a silent disco, a comedy theater, cinema, Wi-Fi and restaurants covering Manchester's grounds, the relatively unknown city is transformed into a unique destination. For festival-goers, it's not uncommon for people to have completely different experiences during the course of the long weekend. And it's not just for the attendees. Many artists would rather perform in front of thousands of people, interacting with other talent rather than playing a solo show, Shafrir said . ""You're isolated when you're on tour, going from city to city,"" she added. ""At a festival, you can interact with other artists, be inspired by them and feed off the crowd."" Location, Robertson said, is another seller for the festival. It's centrally located and easy to get to. That could be why other festivals, such as Rothbury, which was held in the Michigan village of the same name, struggled to stay afloat. Meanwhile, the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, which takes place in Indio, California, is doing so well, it recently added another weekend to its 2012 schedule. Perhaps a festival's true test of success is measured by how good it tastes. As a result of a partnership between Ben and Jerry's and the Bonnaroo festival, the ice cream company created Bonnaroo Buzz, a light coffee and malt ice cream, which made its national debut this year. While Bonnaroo certainly thrives on the extras it offers festival-goers, as well as its diverse musical acts, Mayers says the festival's charm and success really come down to community. ""People are here, living on site,"" he said. ""They're building a true community. People are totally immersed in it. There's no TV, or hotel to go back to. ... It creates a whole different environment and live experience that you can't replicate."" And it's constantly evolving. ""Music is just the entry point for this platform for all arts -- for people to be creative,"" he added. In the future, Bonnaroo, which Mayers calls his ""huge, never-ending art project,"" will probably engage the audience even more and become a platform for people to get involved.","Bonnaroo will bring more than 80,000 people to Manchester, Tennessee .

"Long Beach, California (CNN) -- Taylor Wilson is going to create a safer source of nuclear energy, help reduce the world's stockpile of nuclear weapons, screen container ships for weapons and power manned missions to other planets. But first ... he has to graduate high school in May. Jack Andraka is going to bring his 3-cent screening test for pancreatic, ovarian and lung cancer to market -- an alternative to a standard $800 test. But Jack, 16, hasn't been to high school much lately and isn't even sure he'll graduate. The two teenagers with Justin Bieber style haircuts wowed the 1,400 people who attended TED2013 this week, fitting the conference's theme: ""The Young. The Wise. The Undiscovered."" They were among a number of youthful speakers who Time magazine's Ruth Davis Konigsberg called ""some of the biggest showstoppers at the annual event."" By contrast, some of the older voices onstage struck notes that were far less hopeful. Northwestern University economist Robert Gordon declared that the era of strong economic growth in the United States is over -- as America faces the headwinds of an aging population, debt, inequality and educational weaknesses; he argued that it's hard to foresee innovations that could have the transformative effect electricity, indoor plumbing and the internal combustion engine had in powering growth in the past century. Former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm, calling for a private sector-funded ""race to the top"" among states, lamented the inability of Washington politicians to develop a national energy strategy. She got laughs when she noted that Congress' approval rating is worse than lice, root canals and Donald Trump (although better than that of gonorrhea and meth labs). TED.com: Granholm's clean energy proposal . And Lawrence Lessig, an author and professor at Harvard Law School, sketched an even starker picture of political dysfunction, a ""pathological, democracy-destroying corruption"" in which a tiny minority of Americans representing powerful interests use their campaign donations to determine which candidates survive the primaries. Even against long odds, Lessig said the problem is fixable if enough Americans organize to bring about change. There were other speakers whose inventiveness and ambition were unambiguously upbeat. Jane Chen spoke about developing a lower-tech method to save the lives of premature and low birthweight babies in regions where access to incubators isn't readily available. Her social enterprise Embrace distributes a specially engineered and heated sleeping bag that provides babies the heat they can't generate on their own until they're developed enough to survive. Google CEO Sergey Brin demonstrated Google Glass, a smartphone-like piece of headgear that enables access to your contacts, your e-mail, your searches and your photos. His pitch for the device -- now being tested by a select few for $1,500 apiece and due on the market later this year -- is partly that it frees people up from the ""nervous habit"" of constantly checking their smartphone as they walk: ""Is this what you're meant to do with your body?"" TED.com: Amanda Palmer -- the art of asking . David Lang, talked of his Open ROV project, which markets an $800 kit -- using off-the-shelf parts -- for a remotely operated underwater vehicle that gives its makers the ability to explore underwater worlds in James Cameron fashion. PayPal co-founder Elon Musk didn't mention his recent dispute with a New York Times reporter over the battery range of the all-electric Tesla Model S, but made a case for the car's virtues before describing his effort to market solar panels to homeowners and businesses and his SpaceX commercial venture to the heavens. He screened a video of a reusable 12-story-tall rocket launching, hovering and then returning to a launchpad ready for another flight. SpaceX capsule reaches International Space Station . Keller Rinaudo demoed Romo, a $150 iPhone-powered robot that recently launched. It uses the brains of the phone's computer chip, its camera and a plastic chassis with tank-style treads to zip around a room, express emotions, interact with owners, kids and pets, and function as ""Skype on wheels"" for grandparents dropping in for a virtual visit. Edith Widder, part of the three-person team that developed the device that lured a giant squid to an underwater camera, explained how it was able to get the first-ever video displaying the enormous size and intricacy of the animal in the deep ocean. 13-year old invents system to protect family livestock from lions .

Renowned photographer SebastiÃ£o Salgado showed finely etched works from his forthcoming book ""Genesis,"" a 50-pound, $3,000 behemoth (there's a less elegant and smaller version for under $70) that does justice to the detail of his exquisitely composed black and white photos shot around the world. TED.com: Sugata Mitra -- build a school in the cloud . Stewart Brand, the 78-year-old technologist who came to fame as editor of ""The Whole Earth Catalog,"" introduced an ambitious plan to recreate extinct species, using DNA from museum specimens. The effort, echoing ""Jurassic Park"", won't bring back dinosaurs -- their DNA didn't survive the tens of millions of years since they disappeared -- but aims to ""de-extinct"" such species as the passenger pigeon, declared extinct in 1914. TED normally attracts an audience of the elite of Silicon Valley, Hollywood and venture capital, along with foundation and corporate CEOs, who pay $7,500 for the five-day event, which is moving next year from Long Beach to Vancouver. (CNN has a partnership with TED in which it publishes selected TED Talks along with text pieces by speakers). TED stands for ""technology, entertainment and design,"" although its subject matter has branched out widely since its founding nearly 30 years ago. The ingenuity of this year's youthful speakers was remarkable, and so was the confident way they expressed their ideas. Wilson, 18, is finishing high school while also attending the University of Nevada at Reno. He first attracted attention for creating a nuclear fusion reactor at 14. In his TED Talk, he argued for an alternative to the most widely used nuclear power technologies. Rather than create electricity by heating water and turning a turbine, Wilson's new reactor would use nuclear fission to produce energy from molten salt. His plan would be to centrally manufacture small fission reactors and distribute them widely for burial underground. He said they could last for 30 years without refueling, compared with 18 months for larger commercial reactors. Since the reactors would not be pressurized, radioactivity would not be expelled as widely into the environment as in an accident like the Fukushima disaster, Wilson said. Costs would be lower since reactors would not have to be built onsite. Nuclear weapons could be recycled in the reactor, he said. And most exciting to the young space geek, such a reactor could power a spaceship to a distant planet and then be the power source for a human base at the destination, he said. Andraka, who's 16 and a high school sophomore, won the top prize in the Intel Science Fair competition for his cancer screening test, which relies in part on carbon nanotubes to detect a protein that is present in the blood and urine in the early stages of the three deadly cancers, providing hope that they can be detected in time for a successful cure. He told CNN in an interview that he doesn't go to high school much anymore but is busy with other projects -- including inventing an MRI the size of a credit card and leading a team of high school students competing for the $10 million Tricorder X Prize to design a handheld device people could use to monitor their health. Andraka and Wilson probably don't have to worry about it but another speaker added a sobering element to the celebration of youth at TED. Meg Jay, a psychologist and author, argued against the idea that the 20s are a period of extended adolescence where people can postpone key life choices. By the time people reach 30, they may have missed out on some key chances to take their life in the directions they hope to pursue. ""Thirty is not the new twenty,"" she said, urging people to ""claim your adulthood"" and start making choices. Spoken word poet Shane Koyczan, a 36-year-old whose new video ""To This Day"" has attracted 5.5 million views, offered a reminder that for all that young people can achieve, many still carry a heavy burden. He told of being bullied as a child to the point that, without realizing it, he turned into a bully himself. He spoke of kids being called names, making them feel like ""oddities juggling depression and loneliness"" and challenged them: . ""if you can't see anything beautiful about yourself . get a better mirror . look a little closer . stare a little longer . because there's something inside you . that made you keep trying . despite everyone who told you to quit""","TED2013 conference theme was ""The Young.

"Atareb, Syria (CNN) -- After months of fighting, the regime's men finally abandoned this strategic crossroads. President Bashar al Assad's troops left behind a bullet-riddled ghost town patrolled by rebels and a handful of shell-shocked residents. Fighters had renamed the stretch of the Bab el Hawa highway, which ran through the center of town, the ""Street of Death."" Until recently, they said anyone who dared set foot on it became a target. A mini-graveyard of burned-out armored personnel carriers sat next to the main municipal building, which served as a base for government soldiers. Several weeks after rebels captured the town, the building's walls were still decorated with pro-regime graffiti proclaiming frightening ultimatums: ""Either Bashar or we'll burn this city"" and ""Bashar or nothing."" ""This used to be a very classy area. ... The Turks would come here to see our village,"" said a fighter named Abdullah Behri, who was treated in a hospital in nearby Turkey after losing his left eye to shrapnel during a battle here last May. ""Now it has all turned to hell,"" he said, pointing at the town's deserted streets. Syria says it would use WMDs vs. foreigners . Locals said they used to travel from the surrounding countryside to shop at the Atareb market. It straddles the Bab el Hawa highway, roughly halfway between the Turkish border and the Syrian commercial capital Aleppo, located only 20 miles away. Though rebels appeared to control Atareb, the fight in the surrounding countryside was still far from over. The commander of the local rebel brigade, Ahmed el Faj, was killed on Friday along with at least 11 of his fighters, rebels said, during a botched attack on a nearby regime-controlled police school. Three days later, rebels said they were still waiting for a government hospital to release Faj's body, so that they could hold a proper burial. And residents and fighters said the town still came under daily fire from nearby artillery. U.S. contemplates Syria after al-Assad . ""There is a military base about 6 kilometers away, and it shells us with artillery every day,"" said a resident named Abdul Sayyid, whose restaurant lay in ruins due to the fighting. There also hadn't been any electricity or running water in Atareb in months. Much of the damage in town was focused around the main municipal building. Soldiers had converted offices for running the town's bureaucracy into a military outpost. They fortified the rooftop with sniper's nests that were clearly used to rain bullets on the surrounding neighborhood, judging by the bullet-holes that pock-marked surrounding buildings. They also scrawled graffiti on the walls proudly declaring ""We are the men of the special operations unit."" In one hallway, they built a crude hearth out of bricks for cooking, and even left behind skewers used to grill meat. Residents told stories of atrocities, allegedly carried out by the security forces. An elderly woman who asked to only be called ""Um Abdulazim"" for security reasons, wept as she described how troops arrested, tortured, and then killed her 24-year-old son Qusay. ""My son was handicapped, and they ran a plow over his legs. They killed him and threw him into the street,"" she said, pointing to her head, chest, arm and hips were she said Qusay was shot. Um Abdulazim said the soldiers punished her family for providing food and shelter to anti-government demonstrators. ""He was handicapped."" Referring to Bashar al Assad, she said, ""I hope his mother loses him. ... I hope he loses his sons."" With the government's forces gone, rebels now filled the security vacuum. During a brief visit, gunshots suddenly rang out when a prisoner briefly broke free from a group of rebels. ""Don't kill me, for god's sake. Please don't kill me. For god's sake, pardon me,"" the man screamed as fighters wrestled him back to their pickup truck. Later, rebels said the man was a looter who would be brought before a local legal council that has assumed security responsibilities in the opposition-controlled region. CNN journalists never saw what ultimately happened to the prisoner. Getting to know Syria's first family .

"(CNN) -- Mixed martial arts organization UFC has suspended fighter Matt Mitrione indefinitely for comments made in an interview Monday night about transgender MMA fighter Fallon Fox. Born a man, Fox became a woman through surgery and then trained to fight in mixed martial arts, a story that she revealed earlier to Sports Illustrated. One of Fox's recent female competitors criticized her for not disclosing that she had had a sex change operation before fighting. Fox, who disclosed the operation after the match, won. Mitrione, a former NFL player, appeared Monday on a show called ""The MMA Hour."" He said: ""I have not seen a man beat a woman like that since Chris Brown beat Rihanna."" ""That is a lying, sick, sociopathic, disgusting freak,"" Mitrione said. ""And I mean that. Because you lied on your license to beat up women. That's disgusting. You should be embarrassed yourself."" Fox is the first MMA competitor to go on record about being transgender. ""The reaction has been positive,"" the 37-year-old said in a March CNN story. ""It's just some people, some of society doesn't get it yet. And this is what we're trying to do now, is to inform people and let them know about transgender athletes."" UFC, or Ultimate Fighting Championship, a mixed martial arts promotion group, released a statement about Mitrione's comments. ""The UFC was appalled by the transphobic comments made by heavyweight Matt Mitrione today (Monday) in an interview on the 'MMA Hour,' "" the release said. ""The organization finds Mr. Mitrione's comments offensive and wholly unacceptable and -- as a direct result of this significant breach of the UFC's code of conduct -- Mr. Mitrione's UFC contract has been suspended and the incident is being investigated.

"New Delhi (CNN) -- At least 46 people have died -- including 17 children -- and dozens have been injured after an illegal building still under construction collapsed in western India, police said Friday. The building, in Thane, about 10 kilometers northeast of central Mumbai, caved in on Thursday evening, said Digambar Jangale, a local police official. Seventy people have been injured, according to another police official, Vinod Parab. Rescuers are still searching through the wreckage, Jangale said, and five children are among those pulled alive from the rubble so far Friday. Manoj Gohad, a senior local official, told CNN sister network IBN that people were illegally occupying the first four floors of the building even though it hadn't been completed or authorized. Jangale said the eighth floor was still under construction when the building gave way. The collapse might have been the result of poor construction, he said, but authorities are still investigating what caused it.

"(CNN) -- With darkness as their only cover, Syrian families make a break for northern Jordan. They are fleeing for their lives. Small children walk alongside their mothers, whose arms are reserved for babies and whatever possessions they can carry. In a treacherous nighttime escape such as this one, you walk if you're old enough. As the group makes its way over the border, just a few meters away from its homeland, the sounds of shelling can still be heard in the distance. The war weary continue on, climbing a hill. There are no lights to illuminate their rocky path. Still too close. Still too dangerous. According to Jordan's Border Guard, which gave CNN exclusive access to the area, many fleeing families have been shot at in the past two weeks, and several people have been injured while trying to cross. Read more: Refugees continue to flood Jordan . On this cold night, the number of wounded was far fewer. A member of the Border Guard met them and led them to safety, where they were ushered into a tent and given food. Some shivering children, wrapped in blankets, were too tired to eat. Their parents recounted harrowing experiences. ""My daughter is 2 months old,"" one woman said. ""Don't you think it was extremely difficult on this child to walk with her here in this cold?"" Another mother explained the journey they took: ""When we first got on the road, it was extremely scary. I mean, we saw death all around,"" she said. One man, who arrived with his wife and five children, detailed the high price of this pilgrimage -- one he was all too willing to pay. ""All we were able to bring with us were the clothes on our backs and the clothes we were able to pack in this bag,"" he said. ""Everything else is back in Syria, but the security situation there is terrible. We can't return."" The Syrian crisis: Where's the U.S. aid going? Most of those who made the journey on this night were women and children. Some had walked for hours, others for days, coming from cities as close as Daraa and as far as Aleppo. Many were too afraid to share their names or appear on camera, for fear of reprisal or that relatives back home would be targeted. Close by, in the back of a Jordanian ambulance, sat an 80-year-old woman who'd been carried across the border. She hated leaving home but had no choice, recounting how several members of her family had been killed in just a few days' time. ""The first day, they killed my nephew,"" she said, her voice brimming with anger at a regime she despised. ""The second day, they killed my niece. Third day, my cousin. Fourth day, another cousin. Four days, and every day a killing."" Read more: Jordan election praised by observers . The United Nations estimates that at least 60,000 people have died in 22 months of fighting between government forces and rebels seeking to depose President Bashar al-Assad. Now, Syrians are crossing into Jordan in record numbers, with at least 350,000 refugees having flowed into Jordan since the beginning of the Syrian conflict. At least 40,000 have arrived in Jordan this year alone, and half of that has been in the past week, Jordanian government officials say. Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh described the numbers as ""staggering."" ""This is obviously a reflection of the level of violence in southern Syria, and there will probably be more in the next few days,"" he said last week. ""We are getting aid. We are getting aid from Arab countries, from Western countries, from international organizations. It is still not enough, given the numbers that are coming in."" Analysis: Jordan's King Abdullah faces crisis . Last week, the International Rescue Committee warned of a ""protracted humanitarian emergency"" in Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq, which have absorbed about 600,000 Syrian refugees since the conflict began. On Monday, Oxfam launched an $18.9 million emergency appeal to help up to 120,000 Syrians. ""In Jordan alone, there has been a threefold increase in the daily rate of people crossing from Syria in the last week,"" said a statement from the aid agency, which added that ""extreme winter weather was compounding misery for refugees, with an increase in respiratory infections and pneumonia recorded in clinics in Lebanon and Jordan."" Jordan's Border Guard told CNN the border will remain open but that the exodus from southern Syria has severely taxed resources. ""It takes a huge effort to mobilize this response right now,"" said Brig. Gen. Hussein al-Zuyud, commander of the Border Guard. ""We're in winter, and that makes it even more difficult. ""On the front lines, at the crossing points, there are times when we have to stay with the refugees for 48 hours, which requires logistical tools and supplies, heating supplies and blankets. And all this is an added burden on us."" From the border, the refugees are loaded onto buses that will take them to their new home: the Zaatari Camp outside Amman, which already houses around 80,000 of their fellow Syrians. Most of the families simply seemed happy for a respite. Having left war-ravaged homes and tattered belongings behind, they were ready for a new start, no matter how temporary. Even a tent would be better than the alternative. ""There's nothing we weren't hit by,"" said one woman, whose voice welled with emotion when describing the trauma of just trying to survive back in Syria. ""Rockets, barrel bombs, warplanes -- the shells were falling on us like rain.""","Women and children are among the refugees who walk across border to Jordan .

"NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- The skies crack open and release a torrential shower. It seems fitting to return with my cousin Adrian in a fit of wind and rain to the home he shares with his brothers. CNN White House correspondent Suzanne Malveaux caught up with her cousins on a trip to New Orleans. We pass the Superdome under heavy, dark clouds and head to New Orleans East, the windshield wipers punctuating our brief catch-up time on the eve of Hurricane Katrina's two-year anniversary. We pull up to Adrian's home in the city's Upper 9th Ward, in what was once the comfort and security of a black, middle-class community. In front of his leveled four-bedroom suburban home sits his tiny FEMA trailer. Parked in the backyard is another FEMA trailer, the deluxe version for his brothers -- my cousins Roy, Leo, Kenneth and Vernon (aka ""the Artist,"" as many came to know him through my profile of his story immediately after Katrina on CNN). Little has changed in the two years since the story I did on my cousins -- brothers who had been living in the 7th Ward, in the house they grew up in.  Watch Malveaux catch up with her cousins » . They qualify for a low-income loan and a $30,000 grant to elevate their home but like so many New Orleans residents, they are in a holding pattern, waiting for the funds to come through. They now live in FEMA trailers in the backyard of their brother Adrian's property, which is closer than theirs to being rebuilt. Adrian is actually more fortunate than his brothers, for his home, located in New Orleans East, will stand again. Vernon, who had lost so many of his paintings in the storm, decimated by the water and mold left by Katrina, showed me his works in Adrian's gutted garage. They were restored by a group of generous volunteers from an art studio in Pensacola, Florida, and returned to him in New Orleans, where they've been housed in this dry place. With no electricity in the garage, Vernon holds up lanterns to the oil canvases and shows me where he has been retouching the beautiful contours of his images of Jesus Christ, and his model-like angels. We run from the garage, under an umbrella, onto a ramp and into the FEMA trailer where he and ""the brothers"" live. Compared with the previous trailer where the five men shared into cramped quarters, I am, perhaps amusingly, impressed at how large the living space is. They are lucky to have gotten one equipped for the handicapped, so their bathroom and kitchen are, surprisingly, relatively large. Leo opens up a cabinet full of food with the pride only a cook can possess. We take a tour of Adrian's house, just a skeleton now but full of potential. It was appraised at $277,000, and he is pleased. He was covered with flood and homeowners insurance, and has received $51,000 from the state's Road Home program. After two years of paperwork and pain, it looks like he will finally be able to rebuild his home. But he is exhausted. He has been carrying the financial and emotional burden of taking care of his brothers for two years, and it is beginning to show. He has trouble sleeping and experiences occasional nightmares. He works seven days a week managing a business, and from time to time goes through ""crashes"" -- 36-hour periods when he just rests. He is the glue that keeps the family together and above water, at least post-Katrina. He lives in a tiny FEMA trailer parked on the lawn in front of his destroyed home. Everyday he is reminded of the past, and the possibilities of the future. He gets angry when he sees stories about New Orleans residents accused of being ""lazy."" ""We're not looking for handouts,"" he says. ""Why don't you tell the stories about people being resilient?"" He also implores politicians to come down and experience what it's like to really live in New Orleans -- not taking the typical bus tour, but seeing what it's like to live in the cramped quarters of a trailer. Adrian and his brothers try to keep a sense of humor about it all. While Vernon the artist is so thin that he is easily blown by the storm's winds that whip through the scaffolding of Adrian's home, Adrian jokingly points to his trailer's tub, which he once tried to squeeze into, only to find himself stuck. Each of the brothers finds solace in simple escape. Trailer life demands it. Vernon retraces the brush strokes of the portraits of angels he once painted. Leo sits in his favorite spot in the sun. Kenneth, nicknamed ""Rooster,"" quietly sips a beer, and takes a slow drag of his cigarette. Roy changes the TV channel, in search of a picture different from the one that surrounds him. And Adrian, who gives so much of himself to others, ocassionally takes a brief respite with a long walk. They work hard in their lives, and in being patient. It is two years now since the storm hit. They've lived with relatives, in a hotel, and now in these trailers. My cousin Leo's eyes swell with tears when he talks about the day he'll feel at home again, when he has a home. I want to take all of them back with me, but New Orleans is where they belong. It is where they long to be whole again.

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- Economist Lucas Papademos was formally sworn in Friday as the head of Greece's new unity government, as the nation seeks to regain political and financial stability after weeks of uncertainty. Papademos, a former banker and European Central Bank vice president, becomes the country's interim prime minister after several days of political wrangling. His ministers were also sworn in at a ceremony attended by the president and the head of the Greek Orthodox Church. Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos has retained his post in the new government, the prime minister's office said. Stavros Dimas, a former EU environment commissioner, is the new foreign minister. He belongs to the New Democracy party, the main opposition to the previous government. Greece's new defense minister, Dimitris Avramopoulos, is also a New Democracy lawmaker. The newly sworn-in Cabinet was scheduled to head next to the Greek Parliament and later hold its first meeting. A vote of confidence in the new government is expected after debate in Parliament on Monday. Then the coalition will face the challenge of implementing a bailout package and austerity measures agreed to with European leaders last month. The new administration must act quickly to ensure release of the next tranche of money from a 2010 deal. Those funds are essential to ensure that Greece does not default on its debts in the next few weeks. It is hoped that the national unity government will restore political stability in Greece after several weeks of turmoil that have unnerved global financial markets. European markets were up slightly as of lunchtime Friday. U.S. markets also opened higher, calmed by signs of action in Greece and Italy to curb their respective debt crises. Italy's Senate approved austerity measures demanded by Europe Friday which will be sent to the lower house at the weekend. Papademos has said that ratifying the bailout deal and bringing in the austerity measures will be the priority for his government. He also restated Greece's commitment to the euro, saying its membership of the eurozone, the 17 nations that use the euro as currency, was a guarantee of financial stability. Papademos, who helped usher Greece into the euro in 2001, replaces outgoing Prime Minister George Papandreou, who resigned over his handling of the crisis. Fresh elections are likely in February. Vassilis Monastiriotis, a senior lecturer for the Hellenic Observatory at the London School of Economics, said Papademos has the advantage of a well defined assignment -- ratifying the October 26 bailout agreement and passing the legislation to implement it. But he faces a challenge in forming a unity government, especially given the reluctance of the main opposition party to be involved and the divisions within Papandreou's socialist PASOK party, Monastiriotis said. Papademos is well versed in Greece's financial and political systems and is well respected by economists, Greece's politicians and European leaders, Monastiriotis added. It remains to be seen how the Greek people will respond to Papademos' actions in office, he said, but the general response Thursday was one of relief at the appointment of a man seen as the ""best solution"" available. There have been no large demonstrations of public anger in Greece over the past 10 days since the political crisis was sparked by Papandreou's call for a referendum on the European bailout deal, he added. Before that, tens of thousands of angry demonstrators had rallied in the capital, Athens. ""The public has been quite muted, they don't know how to react,"" he said. While they don't like the austerity measures attached to the bailout any more than they did two weeks ago, he said, they also do not want discussion of Greece leaving the euro zone. Speaking after his appointment was confirmed, Papademos said the government's formation would allow Greece to ""face the problems in the near future in the best possible way."" The country is ""at a critical crossroads,"" the 64-year-old said, and the choices it makes and policies it implements ""will have a crucial importance for the welfare of the Greek people."" Papademos said Greece's course would not be easy, but that the country's problems would be solved -- and that would happen ""sooner, at a lower cost and in a more efficient way, if there is unity, consensus and reasonableness."" He said he had accepted the president's mandate to form a unity government because he felt everyone should contribute to the country's recovery. ""The task is big, and the responsibility I assume is even bigger,"" he said. Papademos, an economics professor at Harvard University, was the governor of the Bank of Greece when the country adopted the euro in 2001. He has advised Papandreou on economic matters for the past two years, the Athens News Agency reported. A native of Athens, Papademos studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1970s, earning undergraduate and graduate degrees before receiving a doctorate in economics, the news agency said. He has taught economics at Columbia University and the University of Athens. The drama in Greece had shaken international markets because investors were afraid the new bailout deal -- which has stringent austerity measures attached -- might not be implemented.

"(CNN) -- A home remedy for insomnia shared by Dr. Oz on his TV show left a New Jersey man sick, sore, lame and disabled from third-degree burns, according to a lawsuit filed last week in New York. Dr. Mehmet Oz called it ""my night sleep special"" on the April 17, 2012, episode of his NBC show titled ""Dr. Oz's 24-Hour Ultimate Energy Boost Plan."" It's the ""Knapsack Heated Rice Footsie."" Specifically, it is a pair of socks with uncooked rice -- ""just enough to fill the toe of the sock"" -- and heated in a microwave oven. ""You put this in the microwave until it's warm,"" Oz told viewers. ""Don't get it too hot, just warm."" Put the socks on your feet and go to bed, he said. ""When you do this and lie for about 20 minutes with those socks on in bed, the heat will divert blood to your feet to your heat,"" Oz said. ""when your feet get hot, guess what happens to your body. It gets cold. Your body will automatically adjust its core temperature and as it gets cooler, you're going to be able to sleep better because your body has to be cold in order to be sleepy."" This, in combination with a cup of Rooibos Tea to reduce ""tensions, headaches and irritability,"" should put you to sleep, Oz said. ""If you can do this the right way, you're going to be thanking me for years to come,"" he said. Frank Dietl, watching the show in his Southampton, New Jersey, tried it that night. ""Dietl was severely injured, bruised, and wounded, suffered, still suffers and will continue to suffer for some time physical pain and bodily injuries and became sick, sore, lame and disabled and so remained for a considerable length of time,"" said the civil complaint, filed last Friday in a New York state court. Dietl, 76, suffers from ""neuropathy of the lower extremities,"" a result of diabetes, according to the lawsuit. The condition means Dietl has ""a diminished sensation in his feet,"" it said. He couldn't tell whether the rice was dangerously hot. Dr. Oz and his producers and distributors -- including co-defendants NBC, Sony Pictures Television, ZoCo Productions and Oprah Winfrey's Harpo Productions -- should have warned viewers such as Dietl, the suit said. It was ""reasonably foreseeable"" that someone suffering from neuropathy might have tried the ""Knapsack Heated Rice Footsie"" and ""thereby sustain serious physical injury."" Oz neglected his ""duty and obligation to warn viewing audience as to the possible effects of following the advice offered"" and ""to warn against certain effects of said medical advice as to those persons suffering from other additional medical conditions,"" it said. Dietl is asking the court to award him monetary damages for the ""careless and negligent manner in which the defendants offered medical advice."" His injuries caused him to be ""confined to bed and home, has required medical attention, and has been prevented for some time to come, from pursuing his usual and ordinary activities,"" the suit said. A spokesman for the show gave CNN a brief response to the lawsuit. ""At this time, The Dr. Oz Show has not been served with any complaint and therefore cannot comment on the matter however we stand by the content in our program as safe and educational for our viewers,"" Oz spokesman Tim Sullivan said. CNN's Carolyn Sung contributed to this report.","""Knapsack Heated Rice Footsie"" caused third-degree burns to feet, lawsuit contends .

"Kaufman County, Texas (CNN) -- The memorial service Thursday for a slain Texas prosecutor and his wife was somber, but one phrase made mourners erupt in applause. ""Chase 'em down. Go get 'em. Bring 'em to justice,"" said Chris Heisler, who led the service, drawing cheers and whistles from the crowd. ""Take them out of the hole they come from."" The emotional plea came as investigators search for suspects in the unsolved killings of two prosecutors that have shaken this Texas county and drawn national attention. Before the memorial, Texas Gov. Rick Perry made a similar appeal, calling the slayings ""direct attacks on the core of our civil society"" and announcing that authorities were offering a new reward of up to $100,000 for information leading to the arrest and indictment of the killers. ""These are heinous crimes, and they've affected not just Texans but people across the country who respect the rule of law,"" Perry told reporters. District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife, Cynthia, died in a weekend shooting at their home, almost exactly two months after McLelland's chief felony prosecutor, Mark Hasse, died in a daytime shooting outside the county courthouse. Investigators are considering a wide array of potential culprits but haven't arrested any suspects. Mourners at Thursday's memorial for the McLellands said they were holding out hope. ""We don't know what happened,"" said Skeet Phillips, a family friend. ""But I pray every night that one of us, one of these fine law enforcement officers, is just going to accidentally get the right break, the right step, and then we'll find these people."" Vows to follow in McClellands' footsteps . Police saluted a flag-draped casket Thursday afternoon at a memorial service for the McClellands as family, friends and members of the community packed the pews of a baptist church. About 1,000 people attended the public service in Sunnyvale, Texas, CNN affiliate WFAA reported. A funeral for the family is scheduled for Friday. Speakers at Thursday's ceremony vowed to follow in the McClellands' footsteps. ""We will not stop pursuing justice. We will not give up the good fight. We will not stop doing God's work,"" said Bruce Bryant, chief investigator of the Kaufman County District Attorney's Office. ""We will pause only to celebrate the lives of those we have lost, but we will not stop."" Daughter Christina Foreman said she came to the lectern to deliver the message her parents would have wanted her to share. ""He was quite eloquent in saying that he didn't give a sh-t if people were scaring him, and he wasn't frightened, and he was going to stand his ground,"" she said. ""And I think that we need to follow in those footsteps, not just the people in law enforcement, not just the people that do the jobs day to day, but everybody. We can't let the fear of what people are going to do to us or say to us, or the fear of them of what they're going to do to our families stop us from doing the right thing. ""The right thing is never the easy thing. It's never the easy path. It's hard, and he knew that. And he stood up anyway."" Outside after the memorial, bagpipes played taps as Perry presented a folded American flag to the family. On the roof of the church, snipers stood guard. No clear suspects . Authorities are considering a wide array of potential culprits -- such as a white supremacist gang targeted by officials last year, drug cartels, and someone who may have held a personal grudge. While authorities offered no new information on the investigation Thursday, Perry said investigators would leave ""no stone unturned"" in finding the killers and any group they might be associated with. ""Any organization that is operating in the state of Texas outside the bounds of our laws is going to be put on notice that we're going to hunt you down, we're going to punish you and do our best to remove that type of threat to the safety of the citizens of the state of Texas,"" Perry said. A law enforcement official speaking on the condition of anonymity told CNN Wednesday that authorities ""haven't come close to charging anyone."" The official was not authorized to publicly release details of the investigation. FBI computer teams searching for evidence . An FBI computer analysis response team has joined the investigation. The team is scouring for digital evidence on computers, phones and other electronics belonging to the McClellands and Hasse, said Katherine Chaumont, a spokeswoman for the FBI's Dallas Field Office. Such forensic investigations could be used to search for threats that might have been made against them and could help investigators learn more about the victims' lives. Chaumont would not specify whether the investigators were examining devices belonging to anyone else, such as witnesses or possible suspects. Investigating local residents . Since Hasse was gunned down near the county courthouse on January 31, authorities have pored through his case files, including public corruption cases, to see if any defendants he tried may have sought vengeance. Authorities met with Eric Williams, a former justice of the peace who was convicted last year of burglary and theft by a public servant. Surveillance video showed Williams apparently stealing computer monitors from the county courthouse. He was sentenced to two years' probation. Saturday night, hours after the McLellands were found dead in their home, investigators met Williams at a local Denny's restaurant, his attorney told CNN Tuesday. Investigators took swab samples from Williams' hand to test for gun residue, attorney David Sergi said. The law enforcement official said Williams is ""one angle we are looking at,"" the official said. Sergi says his client voluntarily cooperated because he has nothing to hide. Another Kaufman County resident has drawn the interest of investigators. The man, who has been trying to open a gun range on his property, was involved in a civil dispute with McLelland and the county. The resident told CNN that FBI agents visited him and asked a few questions, but nothing else materialized. Speculation about the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas . McLelland, in an interview with The Associated Press before his death, speculated that the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas could have been behind Hasse's slaying. ""We put some real dents in the Aryan Brotherhood around here in the past year,"" McLelland told the news agency. McLelland said Hasse wasn't involved in the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas investigation, but his office was one of numerous Texas and federal agencies involved in an investigation that led to the indictment last year of 34 alleged members of the group -- including four of its senior leaders -- on racketeering charges. Authorities have not said whether they have linked white supremacists to the deaths. But weeks after the indictment, the Texas Department of Public Safety said it had ""credible information"" the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas was planning to retaliate. Asked about the group's possible involvement, the governor said it was too soon to link or discount the it. ""I think it's obviously too early to be speculating on whether there is any direct contact, but I think it's wise for us to not overlook any evidence that either may be superficial or otherwise,"" Perry said on Fox News. ""So they are here, they are active in this state. We know the drug cartels are very, very active in our country now,"" Perry said. Eric Fiegel reported from Kaufman County; Holly Yan and Catherine E. Shoichet reported and wrote from Atlanta.

"Washington (CNN) -- A day after a 75-minute session, talks will resume Monday to try to reach a deficit-reduction deal and pave the way for a hike in the nation's $14.3 trillion debt ceiling, a White House spokesman said Sunday. White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer said on his Twitter account on Sunday night that congressional leaders will return to the White House for further negotiations on Monday. At 11 a.m. that same morning, President Barack Obama will hold a press conference in the White House briefing room, according to his official schedule. These announcements are the first formal fall-out of Sunday's night talks on the subject, led by the president and involving top politicians from the House and Senate. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said afterward that Democrats are ""still hopeful for a large bipartisan agreement,"" one that will do ""no harm to the middle class or to economic growth (and) protect Medicare and Social Security beneficiaries."" Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, meanwhile said that he found it ""baffling that the president and his party continue to insist on massive tax hikes in the middle of a jobs crisis."" Those comments echoed many others made by key figures in both parties, as they posture to try get a deal that cuts into the nation's debt. Republicans initiated the fight when they demanded drastically reduced spending (but no tax hikes) before they agreed to raise the nation's debt ceiling. Obama responded by saying he backs an ambitious plan to reach $4 trillion, mostly through cuts but also with revenue increases. If Congress doesn't act by August 2, the government could begin defaulting on its obligations. The president hinted at that sense of urgency Sunday. When asked before the meeting's start if a deal can be reached within 10 days, he told reporters, ""We need to."" Meanwhile, a Democratic congressional aide said Sunday's talks produced ""no breakthroughs yet,"" as the president pushed still for a ""grand bargain-style deal that includes revenues, like getting rid of millionaire tax breaks, while Republicans argued it was time to lower sights to a smaller deal that relies on cuts alone."" A senior Obama administration official said the president continued to push  for a ""big deal,"" saying he would not accept a short-term agreement or anything that in the White House's view is not balanced. As he has said previously, he challenged congressional leader to step up and do something substantial. An aide to House Speaker John Boehner, meanwhile, said the Ohio Republican countered by saying he wanted a deal that was based on previously discussed budget cuts outlined by a bipartisan group led by Vice President Joe Biden. Boehner had hinted at the GOP's strategy on Saturday evening, when he issued a statement saying that his party cohorts could not support a major deal as long as Obama and Democrats insist on increasing taxes. He said that any such revenue-raising initiative would prevent the bulk of Republicans from supporting a more ambitious deal, even if it was one including cutting spending and reforming entitlement programs such as Medicare. The House speaker said, as a result, that the talks' parameters would be scaled back to focus on budget cuts alone. The White House immediately pushed back, with a senior administration official saying Boehner had initially accepted the need to increase tax rates on wealthy Americans as part of a deal. But then, the official said, Republicans offered a different plan in the talks with Obama that began Thursday. In the statement Sunday night, the Boehner aide insisted that Obama ""agreed with the speaker that their previous talks did not produce any agreement."" Obama believes ""it is time to solve this problem,"" White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley said on ABC's ""This Week"" program Sunday. He added that Obama's ""call to the (congressional) leaders is to step up and be leaders."" The Treasury Department has warned that failure to raise the debt ceiling could lead to a default, which could push interest rates to skyrocket and cause the dollar to plummet. But Republicans, including those controlling the House, have said they'll block any such move without substantial budget cuts. A U.S. default on its debt obligations would have ""real nasty consequences"" for the United States and the global economy, the new director of the International Monetary Fund said in an interview broadcast Sunday. ""It would jeopardize the stability at large,"" Christine Lagarde, who last week became the first woman to head the global financial institution, told ABC. Still, such warnings didn't prevent party leaders on Sunday talk shows from reverting back to time-tested talking points that suggested the two sides were still far from an agreement. ""What is really appalling is to see our Republican colleagues essentially providing a form of extortion -- if you don't agree to deficit reduction the way we want it, we'll put all the jobs at risk, because we will allow the United States to default on its debt,"" said Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, on the CNN show ""State of the Union."" ""That's irresponsible."" At the heart of the GOP resistance is a bedrock principle pushed by conservative crusader Grover Norquist against any kind of tax increase. A pledge pushed by Norquist's group, Americans for Tax Reform, has been signed by more than 230 House members and 40 senators, almost all of them Republicans. After Sunday nights talks, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's spokesman Adam Jentleson said that the Nevada Democrat wants ""an approach that is balanced between spending and revenues."" However long it takes, he said that Reid is ""firmly committed"" to striking a deal. ""Sen. Reid believes the stakes are too high for Republicans to keep taking the easy way out, and he is committed to meeting every day until we forge a deal, however long it takes,"" said Jentleson. CNN's Ted Barrett, Dan Lothian and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","NEW: An official says Obama said Sunday he won't accept a short-term deal .

"(CNN) -- More than 90% of the Internet access in Syria was shut down on Thursday, according to the Internet monitoring group Renesys. It was not clear who was behind the latest event, but the government has intermittently cut off Internet access several times in the past two years. Opposition activists often transmit updates about the civil war in reports and images on the Web. Syria has shut down the Internet in the past, said U.S. Ambassador to Syria Robert Ford. Ford added that the United States has given ""a thousand pieces of non-lethal equipment -- largely communications gear"" to help opposition activists get around blocks to the Internet. He was speaking in Washington about the humanitarian situation in the country on Wednesday and responding to CNN's questions. ""The Syrian government has been monitoring [the Internet] for years. They have been using the Internet with Iranian assistance to track opposition activists, arrest and kill them,"" Ford said. ""That is the reason why our non-lethal assistance to the Syrian opposition, we put a special emphasis on communications equipment precisely to help the Syrian people tell the world what is going on inside Syria,"" he said. Ford said he doesn't want a repeat of the 1982 massacre in Hama when Hafez al-Assad, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's father, shut down all communication there and the world didn't have a clear picture of what had occurred. ""A lot of the pictures that you see on the nightly news are from communication equipment that we supply to very brave and very dedicated opposition activists inside Syria,"" Ford said. ""We have provided over a thousand pieces of non-lethal equipment -- largely communications gear to help them get around the restrictions on the Internet that the Syrian government imposes."" Meanwhile, the road to Damascus International Airport has been shut down because of continuing clashes and military operations in towns on the outskirts of the city, the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Egypt Air is canceling flights to Syria starting Friday until further notice, said Egypt Air spokesperson Mohamed Rahma. The airline cited the ""deteriorating situation"" around the Damascus airport, a Cairo airport official said, according to Egyptian semi-official news agency al Ahram. These events are part, some believe, of a possible turning point in the nearly two-year war. On Wednesday villagers in northern Syria picked pieces of a downed fighter jet from an olive grove after rebel fighters claimed to have shot down three government aircraft in 24 hours. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government has relied more on air power to battle the 21-month-old revolt against it, and witnesses said a cheer went up when the jet went down near Aleppo. ""We want to take this ... to show them in the other villages,"" a man who identified himself as Abu Dargham told CNN as he showed off two twisted chunks of metal. ""Let them see what happened to these planes."" The downed plane's tail was largely intact, but the fuselage was in pieces and the type of aircraft was not immediately identifiable. Locals picked it apart, with some stuffing pieces into in bags as a tractor hauled away what appeared to be an engine. Cheering children were piled on the tractor as it drove away. Witnesses said two fliers ejected from the plane before the crash. One was found unconscious and taken to a makeshift clinic, while villagers said they were still searching for the other late Wednesday. Rebels posted two videos online to support their claims. One shows rebels carrying an unconscious man wearing what looks like a military pilot uniform, while another includes footage of medics bandaging a bloodied and moaning pilot. ""Here is the pilot who was shelling houses of civilians!"" someone says off-camera. ""The heroes of Darret Ezza shot down his plane!"" In addition to the jet brought down Wednesday, the rebels say they have shot down two helicopters since Tuesday night. Rebel video showed one helicopter exploding in midair, but CNN could not independently confirm the authenticity of the footage. The claims of success follow the capture of a key Syrian air force installation last week. Rebel fighters who overran the base reported finding more than 300 Soviet-era anti-aircraft missiles, along with heavy machine guns, rockets and even tanks. About half the shoulder-fired missiles were inoperable, but the rebels soon posted video instructing viewers how to handle the ones that worked. Syrian commanders often kept the trigger components separately to prevent the weapons from being used if they were captured. The installation housed troops from the Syrian army's 46th Regiment. Rebel forces surrounded the base for two months, harassing the troops inside with sniper fire and waiting for them to weaken, Hussein al-Shule said. ""The government will try to airdrop supplies from helicopter. They did not dare land,"" al-Shule said. ""Most times they would miss, and we would take the food. It was inedible."" Opposition says 157 killed Wednesday . The claims came on a day when opposition activists said another 160 people were killed in the country's civil war, which dates back to March 2011. Of those, at least 15 were killed in shelling at Al-Ansari district in the city of Aleppo on Thursday, among the deaths were 5 children and two women, at least 20 others were wounded. In Daraa, a car bomb exploded outside the house of the head main branch of the Baath party. Three guards were killed, and four were seriously injured. By the end of Wednesday, at least 96 had died in the Damascus area, most of them in a single incident -- a pair of car bombings in the town of Jaramana that killed 77 people, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a network of opposition activists. Jaramana, a small town surrounded by fields, has provided a refuge for pro-government Syrians displaced in the civil war. Its residents are a mix of Christians and Druze, the latter a minority offshoot of Shiite Islam. Women and children were among those killed there, the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. Syria's Interior Ministry had conflicting numbers for the bombings, reporting 34 dead and 83 injured. Read more: Opposition says shelling killed 10 children in Syria . At the same time the car bombs went off, two explosive devices simultaneously detonated in the al-Nahda and al-Qerayyat neighborhoods, both of which are in the Damascus suburbs. Officials did not provide a casualty count in those areas. Government officials blamed the attacks on terrorists, a term Syria routinely uses for rebel fighters and extremist elements in the country. Read more: Young Syrian amputee makes dangerous journey to find help . About 40,000 civilians have been killed since the first protests began against al-Assad's government, according to the opposition Center for Documentation of Violations in Syria. More than 380,000 Syrian refugees have fled to neighboring countries, creating humanitarian challenges abroad. CNN cannot confirm claims by the government or the opposition because of government restrictions that prevent journalists from reporting freely within Syria. Turkey's role . Turkey asked NATO Wednesday for Patriot missiles to bolster its air defenses against its southern neighbor, with which it shares an 822-kilometer (about 511-mile) border. A letter to NATO included the ""formal request"" that the alliance send ""air defense elements,"" according to a Turkish government statement that cited ""the threats and risks posed by the continuing crisis in Syria to our national security."" The statement added that the NATO Council would convene ""shortly"" to consider the matter. NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said in a Twitter post that the request would be considered without delay. A fact-finding team is on the ground in Turkey, according to Lt. Col. Jay Janzen, a spokesman for Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe. ""The fact-finding teams include experts from the nations that have shown their willingness to offer Patriots as well as Turkish officials and a few NATO experts,"" he said. Turkish officials have emphasized that any deployment of the Patriot missiles would be purely for defensive measures. President Abdullah Gul said earlier this month that Turkey has no intention of going to war with Syria. A NATO official who is not authorized to speak on record to the media told CNN that the fact-finding team now in Turkey includes military personnel from Germany, the United States and Holland, the three countries that have available Patriot missile batteries. The official also indicated that those batteries could be deployed dozens of kilometers away from the border fence. ""No decisions have been made about the location and numbers of Patriot batteries in Turkey,"" the official said. The official said he doesn't believe ""there will be an imminent threat from this deployment escalating the conflict between Turkey and Syria."" ""By contrast, I think it will demonstrate a deterrence effect,"" the official said, ""and make it clear that NATO is prepared to defend Turkish territory and Turkish population.""

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- A worker at a west Philadelphia abortion clinic has pleaded guilty to two counts of murder and may testify against Dr. Kermit Gosnell, the doctor accused of performing illegal late-term abortions, court officials said. Lynda Williams, a former employee of Gosnell's Women's Medical Society clinic, entered a guilty plea Wednesday to six charges, including two counts of third-degree murder. The first charge is for the 2009 death of an aborted fetus that the Philadelphia district attorney's office claims in a grand jury report was born alive. The second is the death of 41-year-old Karnamaya Mongar, who died in a second-trimester abortion, according to Common Pleas Court Judge Benjamin Lerner. Mongar died November 19, 2009, after overdosing on anesthetics prescribed by Gosnell, according to Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams. The other charges Williams pleaded guilty to are delivery of drugs illegally causing the death of another human being, engaging in corrupt organization and two counts of conspiracy to corrupt. Williams is the fifth person to plead guilty in this case. Gosnell's wife, Pearl, is being charged as a co-conspirator. Lerner said that the district attorney's office is expecting Williams to testify. The Philadelphia district attorney's office grand jury report from January 11, 2011, charged Kermit Gosnell with murder for allegedly performing abortions past the 24-week limit prescribed by law. The report says scissors were used to sever infants' spinal cords. He faces eight counts of murder in the deaths of seven babies and Mongar. Prosecutors filed a pleading saying they intended to seek the death penalty against him. There is a federal criminal investigation into the abortion clinic deaths, and Williams may face federal violations. Williams' sentencing hearing is scheduled for December 20. CNN's Kristina Sgueglia contributed to this report.","Clinic worker pleads guilty to six charges .

"(CNN) -- At two goals to the good against Chelsea in their FA Cup quarterfinal it looked as if Manchester United were going to bury any lingering demons after their demoralizing Champions League exit to Real Madrid. Strikes from Mexican forward Javier Hernandez and England international Wayne Rooney inside the ten opening minutes piled more misery on beleaguered Chelsea boss Rafael Benitez as he weathered abuse from both sets of supporters inside Old Trafford. But the Spaniard made some inspired tactical changes and saw his side draw level thanks to fine goals from Belgian international Eden Hazard and Brazilian midfielder Ramires as only a string of saves from United's Spanish goalkeeper David De Gea prevented Chelsea from a famous win. Their draw now creates a headache for both clubs, as their hectic schedules between now and the end of the season means fixing a date for the replay will present a significant challenge. Whoever wins will face Manchester City in the semifinals at Wembley. Benitez was forced to withstand yet more abuse from Chelsea fans angry at his appointment which was added to by taunts from home fans who remember the Spaniard's many battles with Alex Ferguson when he was manager at their archrivals Liverpool. But after the game Benitez told ITV: ""I think we should have won the game. The second half we were on top, we created the best chances and were in control of the game."" On Mata's great chance late on he added: ""Mata said De Gea made a great save. We have to think about the first game then after we will think about City. It'll be difficult to win because United are a great side."" Ferguson told reporters: ""We're lucky to be in the Cup. We ran out of legs -- our two full-backs, Rafael and Evra, are just knackered."" Cheslea's taxing trip to Romania to play the first leg of their Europa League last-16 tie on Thursday clearly showed in the opening stages as they sunk to a two-goal deficit. Hernandez struck first, looping a header over Petr Cech from Michael Carrick's floated pass. Rooney made it 2-0 moments later as his left wing free kick went through a crowd of bodies inside the area and crept into the far corner of the net. Cech made a fine double save to prevent Chelsea going 3-0 down when he stopped a powerful Rooney effort before springing into action again as David Luiz's misplaced header almost looped into the net. But after Hazard was introduced the game turned and on the hour mark he curled a superb effort into the top corner to give the away side hope. And the comeback was complete when Chelsea swept down field after a United attack and Ramires cut inside his man to beat De Gea with a precise left-footed finish. Fernando Torres had a chance to wrap the game up before Mata cut inside Jonny Evans and struck on goal from six yards out but De Gea stuck out a leg to get a vital touch and divert the ball round the post. The other quarterfinal saw second tier sides Blackburn and Millwall draw 0-0. The winner of that tie will face Premier League side Wigan in the other semifinal. In the English Premier League a late penalty from captain Steven Gerrard helped Liverpool to a 3-2 victory over Tottenham Hotspur, who opened the door for Chelsea to reclaim third spot in the race for Champions League football. The clash at Anfield was billed as a battle between two stars gunning for the player of the year crown -- Tottenham's Gareth Bale, and Liverpool's Luis Suarez. Going into the game Bale had ten goals in his last nine games, Suarez 11 in his last 11. And it was the Uruguayan who struck first for Liverpool, tucking home from Jose Enrique's astute pass to register his 22nd goal of the season. But Tottenham hit back when Belgian defender Jan Vertonghen nodded home Bale's cross right on halftime. Just eight minutes after the break Vertonghen grabbed his second, rifling home from inside the area after a set piece fell to him, and Tottenham looked set to build on their impressive 3-0 win over Inter Milan in the first leg of their Europa League last-16 tie in midweek. But Liverpool responded with two goals in 16 minutes as mistakes from England international Kyle Walker and French goalkeeper Hugo Lloris allowed Stewart Downing to fire Liverpool level. And with eight minutes remaining Benoit Assou-Ekotto bundled Suarez over inside the penalty area and Gerrard slotted home the penalty to move Liverpool up to sixth in the table. Tottenham remain third, two points ahead of Chelsea, but their London rivals have a game in hand. The other Premier League game on Sunday saw Newcastle United ease their relegation worries with a last-gasp 2-1 victory over Stoke City. Stoke went in front in the second half when Ivory Coast international Chieck Tiote brought down Jonathan Walters inside the area and the striker picked himself up to convert from the spot. Newcastle drew level when French international Yohan Cabaye floated a free kick in off the crossbar and in the second minute of injury time Sylvain Marveaux picked out Cisse who controlled before smashing a volley into the net. His side are now nine points clear of the drop zone.","Chelsea fight back from 2-0 down to draw with Manchester United in FA Cup last eight .

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. troops in Okinawa will now be on curfew after the arrest of two U.S. sailors accused of raping a local woman, the commander of U.S. forces in Japan said Friday. Lt. Gen. Salvatore Angelella also apologized Friday in a statement announcing the curfew. ""I want to personally apologize for the grief and trauma the victim has endured,"" the statement said. Read more: Small U.S. base is giant issue in U.S.-Japan relations . The curfew restricts military personnel to the base, a personal home or hotel between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. Police in Okinawa identified the detained sailors as U.S. Navy Seaman Christopher Daniel Browning and Petty Officer Skyler Dozierwalker of Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas. The two men, both 23, are alleged to have raped a Japanese woman early Tuesday, leaving her with a neck injury, police said. They were taken into custody later that day. The incident has prompted a women's group in Okinawa to call for more restrictions on what U.S. military personnel can do when off-base. The issue of violent crimes, especially rapes, by U.S. troops in Japan has divided the two countries for decades. It came to a peak in 1995 when a U.S. sailor and two U.S. Marines were convicted of raping a 12-year-old girl. Tens of thousands of Okinawans took to the streets at the time demanding that the United States leave the island south of Japan's main islands. In that case, the U.S. military at first refused to turn the suspects over to Japanese authorities. But in the most recent case, the suspects were in Japanese custody almost immediately.

The alleged attack took place two months after a U.S. Marine was arrested, accused of assaulting and molesting a woman in Naha, the capital of Okinawa. Relations between the U.S. military and the people of Okinawa have already been stressed in recent months over the U.S. Marine Corps' deployment of MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft to a base on the island. Some Okinawa residents are concerned because the Osprey has had a reputation for crashing. The Okinawan community has long been against the presence of the U.S. military, which recently announced that thousands of Marines will be moved to a base in Guam.","Two U.S. sailors were arrested this week, accused of raping a local woman .

"(CNN) -- The leader of an Amish sect in Ohio, who was indicted on federal charges for allegedly shaving the beards and cutting the hair of community members, must pay for his own legal defense after making millions off an oil-and-gas deal, court documents show. Previously ruled indigent, Samuel Mullet Sr. received about $2 million in early March by leasing the rights to his 800-acre farm in Bergholz and will now have to foot the bill for his public defender should he choose to keep him, the judge ruled Monday. He is free to retain private counsel, should he choose to do so. The proceeds from the lease allowed Mullet to ""free the farm of all outstanding debt and mortgages,"" court documents said. Because of his newfound wealth, Mullet must pay the public defender twice his normal government subsidized rate -- $250 per hour, a court order signed by U.S. District Judge Dan Polster said. Mullet, who is the bishop of the Amish community in Bergholz, also was ordered to pay an hourly rate of $125 for legal work performed before the ruling was made. In December, 12 members -- 10 men and two women -- of the breakaway Amish sect were indicted on federal charges of conspiracy to violate the Matthew Shepard-James Byrd Hate Crimes Prevention Act. They were also charged with obstruction of justice in the five incidents, which prosecutors said occurred between September and November. Mullet is being held without bond, because the court considers him a threat to the community and a flight risk. He has offered to secure his pretrial release through either a ""significant cash bond"" or by ""pledging his property,"" court documents said. The trial is scheduled to start August 27. The manner in which Amish men wear their beards and Amish women wear their hair are symbols of their faith, authorities have said. Mullet ""exerted control over the Bergholz community by taking the wives of other men into his home, and by overseeing various means of disciplining community members, including corporal punishment,"" prosecutors said. As a result of religious disputes with other Ohio Amish, the assaults ""on their perceived religious enemies"" were planned and carried out. The assaults involved the use of hired drivers, as the Amish do not operate motorized vehicles, authorities said. ""The assaults all entailed using scissors and battery-powered clippers to forcibly cut or shave the beard hair of the male victims and the head hair of the female victims,"" authorities said. ""During each assault, the defendants restrained and held down the victims."" During some of the incidents, those who attempted to intervene and protect or rescue the victims were injured, officials said. Afterward, some of the defendants allegedly discussed ""concealing photographs and other evidence of the assaults."" In addition to the other charges, Mullet Sr., Lester Mullet, Levi Miller and Lester Miller are accused of concealing or attempting to conceal evidence including a camera, photographs ""and an over-the-counter medication that was allegedly placed in the drink of one of the assault victims,"" the Justice Department said. ""Every American has the right to worship in the manner of his or her choosing without fear of violent interference,"" Thomas Perez, assistant attorney general for the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division, said in December. The maximum penalty for the conspiracy count is five years in prison upon conviction, authorities said. The hate crimes charges would be punishable by a maximum of life in prison, while the maximum penalty for an obstruction conviction would be 20 years in prison. An FBI affidavit in the case says that Mullet in some cases forced members ""to sleep for days at a time in a chicken coop"" and beat those who appeared to disobey him. Mullet had been ""counseling"" married women in the sect, ""taking them into his home so that he may cleanse them of the devil with acts of sexual intimacy,"" a sworn statement from an FBI agent said. Seven men were arrested in November as part of a raid on Mullet's 800-acre compound, authorities said. When CNN asked Mullet in October whether he was behind the beard-cutting incidents, he asked, ""Beard-cutting is a crime, is it?"" He denied allegations that he was running a cult. Asked about what was, at the time, the start of a federal investigation, Mullet said, ""We're not guilty, so we have nothing to hide. If they want to come and check us out, we'd be glad to see them here."" CNN's Chuck Hadad, Gary Tuchman and Bill Mears contributed to this report.","Amish men's beards and Amish women's hair is a symbol of their faith .

"Hamid Dabashi is the author of ""Iran: A People Interrupted."" He is Hagop Kevorkian Professor of Iranian Studies and Comparative Literature at Columbia University in New York. His Web site is http://www.hamiddabashi.com/. Hamid Dabashi says Muslim Americans can send a powerful message of support for Baha'i minority in Iran. (CNN) -- In their latest communique regarding the fate of seven arrested members of the Baha'i religious minority in Iran, Amnesty International has expressed grave concern they may face the death penalty if they are found guilty of the charges of ""espionage for Israel,"" ""insulting religious sanctities,"" and ""propaganda against the system."" As the Islamic Republic of Iran experiences the most serious challenge to its legitimacy in its 30-year history, the vulnerability of religious and ethnic minorities is the most accurate barometer of the crisis that all Iranians face in these dire circumstances. Of all the various Iranian minorities, the Baha'i community historically has been the weakest and most vulnerable. The world's attention is rightly drawn to the fate of prominent reformists charged with treason, and to the arbitrary arrest, torture, rape and murder of young Iranians. But the fate of the Iranian Baha'is should not be eclipsed under the cloud of other civil rights abuses, for they represent much more than their own small community. Minorities have always been at the mercy of belligerent authorities, particularly when they face a crisis of legitimacy. Kurds in western Iran, Arabic-speaking communities in the south, Azaris in the north, as well as Turkmans and Baluchis in the east have been at the forefront of such discriminations, which has in turn instigated chronic separatist movements in these areas. At the same time, Iranian Zoroastrians, Jews and Armenians have also faced varied degrees of discrimination, at official or cultural levels and registers, as they have joined their Muslim brothers and sisters in opposing domestic tyranny and foreign intervention alike. Among all these minorities, the Baha'is remain the most fragile in part because of intra-Shia sectarian hostilities that go back to mid-19th century and the rise of a vastly popular messianic movement known as Babism, of which the contemporary Baha'is are an offshoot. Its adherents consider themselves the followers of an entirely new religion, in fact the very latest Iranian monotheistic faith with over five million followers scattered over 200 countries. While other religious minorities are specifically protected under the Constitution of the Islamic Republic, this is not the case for the Baha'is. Article 13 of the Constitution has specifically and exclusively recognized Zoroastrian, Jewish and Christian Iranians as ""the only recognized religious minorities, who, within the limits of the law, are free to perform their religious rites and ceremonies, and to act according to their own canon in matters of personal affairs and religious education."" The word ""only"" in this article seems specifically designed to exclude the Baha'is from this clause. Having the same effect, Article 14 of the Constitution stipulates the constitutional protection of the minorities to be exclusive to those ""who refrain from engaging in conspiracy or activity against Islam and the Islamic Republic of Iran. The location of the Baha'i holy sites in Haifa, Israel, has been a principal source of harassment and intimidation against the Baha'is. This goes back to the late Ottoman period and obviously predates the establishment of the Jewish state in 1948. It's also something over which the Baha'is have had no control. In the face of systematic abuse of civil liberties of the Baha'is, there is very little that the American government can do, particularly in the aftermath of the Bush presidency and eight years of widespread Islamophobia in the United States that did not leave even the last presidential campaign unscathed. Having waged war on two Muslim nations, the U.S. government is in the least favorable position to defend the rights of non-Muslim minorities in their own homeland. In addition, during the eight years of Bush presidency, and in the aftermath of the events of 9/11, being a Muslim became a liability in the United States, creating PR problems even for President Obama's middle name. It was not until former Secretary of State Colin Powell came out strongly against such vilification of Muslims that a prominent public figure put the problem on the national consciousness. As much as the U.S. government is in the worst position to come to the Baha'is' aid, Muslim Americans are perfectly poised to voice their outrage against the abuse of religious minorities in Iran or anywhere else in the Muslim world, for they know what it feels like to be a political pariah and a religious minority in an overwhelmingly alternate context. Since the terrifying events of 9/11, American Muslim communities have endured much religious and racial profiling and suspicion, as they have seen the terms and icons sacrosanct to their faith maligned and ridiculed in Western Europe, North America and Australia. Multiply that experience many times and extend it back to the late 19th century and that would be the experience of the Iranian Baha'is, trapped inside their own homeland, banned from or exercising the terms of their own sacrosanct principles. The experiences of Muslims as a minority here in the United States, or in Europe for that matter, gives them a unique position to raise their voice against the abuse of non-Muslim minorities in Iran and the rest of the Muslim world. In a world now defined by the presence of multiple faiths inside many nations and as American Muslims learn to come together to protect their own constitutional rights in an old democracy, it would only be fitting if they were to raise their voice in defense of other religious minorities seeking to secure their basic rights to religious liberties in countries aspiring to become democracies. The fate of Iranian Baha'is is not only a matter of their fundamental civil rights in the context of any republic, Islamic or otherwise. It is the very cornerstone of democratic citizenship without which the Muslim majority of Iranians is denied their constitutional protection. Watch the fate of the Iranian Baha'is carefully. The day they are free to practice their religion without fear, Iranians at large will have finally secured their civil liberties. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Hamid Dabashi.","Hamid Dabashi: Seven Baha'is on trial in Iran, perhaps for their lives .

"(CNN) -- Varsha Vinod's exceptional abilities are hard to spot at first. She's an adorably cute 5-year-old girl from southern India, small, pretty with big brown eyes. To gain her black belt, Varsha had to learn up to 15 karate moves. When we meet for our interview, her hair is tied up in two pigtails, with bright hair clips and a glittering headband. She is as shy as most kids her age would be when confronted by a strange man and a television crew. Some child stars can be precocious but Varsha doesn't act like one. In fact, it would have been impossible to imagine her as a karate black belt if it wasn't for her white martial arts outfit and her actual black belt. Like many young girls she would love to be a dancer and she smiles when I tell her that we are doing the interview in a dance studio. It's got varnished wooden floors and ceiling-high mirrors. The venue was chosen because it looks a bit like a dojo, or martial arts school. I'm not sure Varsha understands what a dance studio is and it's hard to discover her thoughts on many things. She only speaks a few words of English and, even when we use an interpreter, she has to be prompted by her father before whispering short, quiet responses to my questions. At first I was concerned her dad was feeding her the answers rather than helping her say what she really thinks. However, it soon becomes clear that this is a healthy father-daughter relationship instead of a case of ""pushy parents."" Vishwas Vinod can be stern with his daughter but she clearly worships him, hanging on his every word and happy to follow his instructions. When the pair practice karate together their movements are surprisingly well synchronized despite the huge difference in size. Varsha's father is her inspiration. He was India's karate champion for four successive years from 1999 to 2002. His daughter started watching him teach the sport and, at the age of 2, she asked to try. Vinod insists it was Varsha's idea not his. Initially, he only gave her some small training and stretching exercises but Dad soon realized that his daughter possessed what he describes as a God-given talent. Vinod says what Varsha has done in 3½ years takes most people eight years to learn. To gain her black belt, Varsha had to learn up to 15 katas. A kata is a sequence of complicated karate moves. Varsha can punch, kick and wield different weapons: the Chinese stick, which is almost as big as she is, and a nunchaku, two short sticks connected by a metal chain. There is no doubt that Varsha's abilities are impressive. You only have to enter the phrase ""nunchaku accidents"" into YouTube to see how easily things can go wrong. However, she is no freak of nature. Her karate is a feat of memory and technique more than agility and power. To be frank, she couldn't beat me up -- although I was obviously far too proud to find out by taking her on in a sparring session. Varsha trains for at least two hours every day but says she still has time for other games. As well as her dancing, she likes to play football and badminton. She tells me that her friends have all started taking up karate after seeing how good she has become. Unlike her friends, Varsha's gift has given her the chance to see London. She was invited to England by a PR company to promote a new video game. Her trip appears to have been handled carefully, with as much time set aside for sightseeing as media work. The day after we filmed with Varsha she was due to go on the London Eye and was very excited about it. Varsha says she would like to continue her karate in the years ahead. She is a black belt first dan, or grade, and there are 10 grades in total. She is already a mini master but if she makes it to second dan she can start teaching -- just like her father.","She's an adorably cute 5-year-old girl from southern India, small and pretty .

"(CNN) -- Miranda Kerr is one of Victoria's Secret's most recognizable models, but rumors spread Wednesday that the company had stripped her of her Angel wings. Victoria's Secret denied the gossip, saying in a statement to CNN that it intends to keep working with her. The reports suggested that the lingerie and clothing brand had decided not to renew Kerr's reported $1 million contract. People magazine and Us Weekly quoted chatty inside sources who claimed that Kerr has ""a difficult reputation"" and ""wasn't very timely."" However, an anonymous source told People that if Kerr were to cease working with Victoria's Secret, the reason wouldn't be because of any behavioral issues. ""It's purely contractual. She'll be coming back for the show, but it's unclear if she'll be in future campaigns,"" the source said. The president and chief marketing officer of Victoria's Secret, Ed Razek, doesn't seem to have a problem with the model and mom of one. He called Kerr, who welcomed son Flynn with husband Orlando Bloom in January 2011, ""one of the best models in the history of the business -- and easily one of the most popular."" Additionally, Razek continued, ""She is also a consummate professional. Any rumors to the contrary are simply untrue. While her international commitments have kept her away from us more than we'd like over the past few years, she will always be an Angel to me."" The company, he said, has ""no plans to stop working with her. In fact, I've already invited her to walk the runway in this year's fashion show and, happily, she's agreed.""

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Show-business writers will go on strike early Monday after their negotiating team recommended a walkout over royalties that could immediately pinch late-night TV shows. Timely programs like ""The Daily Show with Jon Stewart"" could be among the first affected. The Writers Guild of America board voted unanimously to strike as of 12:01 a.m. Monday (3:01 a.m. ET), officials said. The walkout will be the first in 20 years. Steve Skrovan, a screenwriter for the Fox show ""'Til Death,"" said a strike is all but inevitable. ""We've never been more united and we are willing to deal -- and our decision-makers are at the table,"" said Skrovan. ""Their decision-makers are not at the table and that tells you pretty much all you need to know about how the companies are pushing this."" The news of a possible strike is not unexpected, said Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers President Nick Counter. ""By the WGA leadership's actions at the bargaining table, we are not surprised by tonight's recommendation,"" Counter said in a statement on the AMPTP Web site. ""We are ready to meet and are prepared to close this contract this weekend."" The labor impasse is over royalties from DVD sales -- last negotiated in 1988. Writers also want royalties from ""new media"" -- all the various places their works are now distributed, including Internet downloads. ""The future of TV is not going to look like what it's been for the last 30 years,"" said TV writer Dave Schiff, who has penned scripts for ""King of the Hill"" and ""That '70s show."" ""So, you know it's not just for us who are currently working, but writers down the line, that we make sure that we get a... piece of the pie."" Producers say the royalty issues are non-starters, but writers accuse producers of being nonresponsive. ""After 3½ months of bargaining, the AMPTP still has not responded to a single one of our important proposals,"" a statement from the WGA said. ""Every issue that matters to writers, including Internet reuse, original writing for new media, DVDs, and jurisdiction, has been ignored. This is completely unacceptable."" TV writer Bryce Zabel agrees. ""It sounds like the producing companies that have decided to force the writers into a situation of a strike,"" Zabel said late Thursday. ""So really, our choice right now is to accept a completely unacceptable deal or to go on strike. ""Strike is the only option."" If Hollywood writers do go on strike, late-night television hosts like David Letterman, Jay Leno and Jimmy Kimmel, as well as programs like ""The Daily Show"" would feel the pinch first.  Watch how a strike could affect your favorite shows » . Because of their topical nature, networks do not typically shoot these shows in advance. Daytime soaps normally stockpile about 30 days in advance and most prime-time shows would likely make it through the end of the year without any major impact on programming. But networks would have to resort to reruns, news programs and reality shows to fill the schedule in 2008 if a strike were to drag on. The film and television industry is responsible for an estimated 1.3 million jobs in the United States. The union's most recent strike, in 1988, lasted 5½ months.

"NEW ULM, Minnesota (CNN) -- A judge Tuesday ordered chemotherapy for the 13-year-old Minnesota boy with cancer whose mother had fled with him rather than comply with a doctor's recommendation that he undergo such treatment. Daniel Hauser arrives at court Tuesday where a judge ordered he undergo chemotherapy. Daniel Hauser can remain with his parents, but he will have to start the treatments Thursday at Children's Hospital in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and his parents will have to comply with the doctor's treatment schedule, said District Court Judge John Rodenberg, who is overseeing the case. He said the boy's tumor has grown since he underwent an initial course of chemotherapy in February. Dr. Michael Richards examined the boy on Monday. In his report, made public Tuesday, the pediatric oncologist estimated the tumor's size at 5.3 inches by 5.1 inches by 6.3 inches, and said it was ""protruding outside the chest wall. There is further compression of the airway, making the initiation of standard chemotherapy imperative this week."" Richards recommended six cycles of chemotherapy followed by radiation. He added that the ""goal will be to include alternative therapies in which the family is interested, as long as there is not data to suggest that a particular danger exists with any alternative medicine."" Daniel, dressed in khaki pants and a blue short-sleeve shirt, arrived at the courthouse in New Ulm for the Tuesday afternoon hearing accompanied by a law enforcement officer. He ducked under the dashboard, apparently trying to hide from the news media, before getting out of a green minivan. But he did not appear in the courtroom. During the hour-long proceeding, Daniel's mother, Colleen Hauser, sat near her husband hunched over, sobbing occasionally and daubing her eyes. In response to questions from Rodenberg about whether she now believes that chemotherapy is the correct course of treatment for her son, she answered that she did.  Watch spokesman describe family's emotions » . A lawyer representing the family expressed satisfaction with the hearing's outcome. ""We're just glad that the judge found that the parents are loving and that Danny is at home where he needs to be,"" said Tom Hagen. He added that, under the agreement, Daniel will also receive ""alternative health"" treatments to supplement the chemotherapy. And he dismissed the possibility that the parents might take the boy from the state. ""They're willing to do whatever the court says to make sure that Daniel stays at home,"" he said. Last week, Colleen Hauser fled with her son from their rural town of Sleepy Eye, Minnesota, to Southern California after a doctor said the boy's Hodgkin's lymphoma was worsening and recommended chemotherapy. Hodgkin's lymphoma is a cancer that affects the lymphatic system, which is part of the immune system. As the disease progresses, it compromises a body's ability to fight infection. Colleen Hauser had been planning to take Daniel to Mexico for holistic treatment, but opted instead to return home, a family spokesman said.

"(CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and his South Korean and Japanese counterparts warned North Korea against any ""provocative"" moves Sunday ahead of a possible new nuclear bomb test by Pyongyang. Opinion: For South Koreans, a familiar tone from Pyongyang . In a round of calls Sunday, Kerry, Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida and South Korea's Kim Sung-hwan all agreed the North must understand ""that it will face significant consequences from the international community if it continues its provocative behavior,"" according to a summary of the calls from the U.S. State Department. Earlier Sunday, North Korea announced that its leader, Kim Jong Un, ""has made an important decision"" that would strengthen the country. The brief statement on the state-run news agency KCNA provided no details, but it said the decision was made at a meeting of the reclusive Stalinist state's Party Central Military Committee. Across the Demilitarized Zone, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak called on his government to be prepared for a possible test. Lee paid a visit to the underground bunker that serves as the South's crisis management center, his press office reported. South Koreans cast wary eyes to the North . North Korea has conducted two previous nuclear tests, in 2006 and 2009, and proclaimed itself a ""nuclear state"" in 2012. U.S. officials told CNN last week that the North appeared to be ready test another nuclear device ""at any time."" U.S. analysts believe the 2006 test had a yield of about 1 kiloton -- comparable to the explosive power of about 1,000 tons of TNT -- while the second was roughly 2 kilotons, National Intelligence Director James Clapper told a Senate committee in 2012.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama wraps up his trip to the Middle East on Saturday with a walking tour of the ancient city of Petra in Jordan. The city's breathtaking architecture features buildings partly carved into stone cliffs and combines eastern culture with ancient Greek constructions. It is a UNESCO world heritage site. Shortly after a stroll through arid the landscape renowned for its colorful interplay of light and shadow, the president will return to Washington, DC. A last minute success . Just before departing for Jordan on Friday, Obama scored a diplomatic coup when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu apologized to Turkey for a 2010 commando raid that killed nine activists on a Turkish vessel in a Gaza-bound flotilla. The apology, long sought by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Erdogan, eased strained feelings between Turkey and Israel, two vital U.S. allies in the Middle East. It happened in a phone call to Erdogan during a final meeting between Obama and Netanyahu at an international airport in Tel Aviv, minutes before Air Force One departed for Jordan to complete the president's Middle East swing. Obama hailed the development as an important step forward for both countries. Jordan's refugee influx . Friday in Jordan, Obama focused on the civil war in neighboring Syria, with King Abdullah telling reporters that the conflict has caused 460,000 refugees to flood his country and more were on the way. That equals 10% of Jordan's population, and the total could double by the end of the year, the king said in asking for more help from the international community as his country also deals with internal reforms in response to economic woes that are raising public dissatisfaction. Obama said he was working with Congress to provide an additional $200 million to Jordan this year to help deal with the refugee influx, but he remained steadfast in his refusal to pledge U.S. military assistance to the Syrian opposition movement. Refugees flood Jordan town . However, Obama repeated past warnings that his stance on military involvement could change if the Syria uses chemical weapons. Jordan is suffering from refugee fatigue. Masses of people have fled there for from neighboring countries whenever conflict was rife. The Syrian conflict comes on top of the flood of refugees that came from Iraq just a decade ago. The country is a close U.S. ally and has been one of the most stable in the region, but it has seen recent internal turmoil and discontent. King Abdullah has a reputation for benevolence, unlike autocratic rulers such as Syria's Bashar al-Assad or deposed Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. One house of the Jordanian parliament is democratically elected. However, a bad economy and allegations of corruption by public officials have stoked dissatisfaction with him. In November, crowds took to the streets calling for King Abdullah's downfall because of rising gasoline prices. More recently, comments attributed to King Abdullah in the The Atlantic caused further anger toward the king, who was quoted as calling the opposition Muslim Brotherhood a ""Masonic cult"" and referring to tribal elders in his country as ""old dinosaurs."" The royal court says some of King Abdullah's comments in the Atlantic Magazine article were taken out of context by local Jordanian and international media outlets who reported on the article. Courting Israel . In Israel, the last-minute diplomacy added a flourish to Obama's first visit to the Jewish state as president. While the two nations have a key strategic partnership, with the United States supplying military aid and diplomatic support as Israel's most vital ally, Obama and Netanyahu had famously frosty relations during the president's first term. With both beginning new terms after Obama's re-election last year and Netanyahu's recent formation of a new government, the president's visit was an opportunity to reset the relationship and signal unified positions on major issues such as the Middle East peace process and Iran's efforts to develop a nuclear weapon. Obama and Netanyahu met several times during the president's three days in Israel, which also included a state dinner where Israeli President Shimon Peres awarded him the country's highest civilian honor. Before leaving Israel, Obama paid tribute to the father of modern Zionism in a symbolic visit to Theodor Herzl's grave. Joined by Peres, Netanyahu and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, Obama also visited the grave of former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated in 1995. Obama placed a stone at each grave from the grounds of the Martin Luther King Jr. memorial in Washington in a gesture to link the African-American struggle for freedom with the struggle by the Israeli people for a homeland. The president also visited the Holocaust memorial Yad Vashem, where he turned up the ""eternal flame"" of remembrance of the millions of Jewish victims of Nazi death camps in World War II. Fairness for the Palestinians . In Israel, Obama urged young Israelis in a speech to pressure their leaders to seek peace with Palestinians. He asked Israelis to empathize with the plight of Palestinians, and he drew applause when he criticized the Israeli government's controversial policy of building new settlements in disputed territories. Walking through Ramallah and Gaza, political differences become real . During a visit with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah, the West Bank, Obama stressed the need for direct talks between Israelis and Palestinians for a two-state solution. ""The Palestinian people deserve an end to occupation and the daily indignities that come with it,"" he said at a news conference with Abbas, adding that Palestinians deserve ""a future of hope"" and a ""state of their own."" Abbas said the Israeli settlements are ""more than a hurdle to peace,"" calling them illegal and saying it was Israel's duty to stop building them. He envisioned a Palestinian state based on 1967 borders with Jerusalem as capital -- a scenario unacceptable to Israel.

"(CNN) -- Europe's largest cruise ship, the MSC Preziosa, set sail on its maiden voyage from the western France port of Saint Nazaire on Thursday. The ship actually holds the title jointly with its sister ship the MSC Divina, which first set sail in May of 2012. Both measure 333 meters long by 38 meters wide and can hold 4,345 passengers. The mega-ships each weigh 140,000 tons and can travel at speeds of up to 23 knots. Swiss-Italian cruise operator MSC Cruises says the ship has 30,000 square meters of public area, including pools, a casino and a theater. The boat is the 12th in MSC's fleet, making it the world's third biggest cruise line, according to company CEO Pierfrancesco Vago. The ship has quite the interesting back story. According to various reports, a shipping firm in Libya originally ordered it. But payments were halted in the wake of the Libyan revolution in 2011. MSC Cruises stepped in and purchased the already-in-progress ship from builder STX France. The luxury cruise ship is now on its pre-inaugural 9-day/8-night cruise from Saint Nazaire, that will end in Genoa, Italy on Friday, March 22. There a christening ceremony will take place before it departs on March 24 on its first official cruise. The five-night voyage begins in Genoa and includes stops in Naples, Messina, Tunis and Barcelona.","At 333 meters long, it is Europe's equal biggest cruise ship .

"(CNN) -- Former child star and radio personality Danny Bonaduce is nursing a nasty bite mark after a fan latched onto his face at a Washington state casino Friday night. Bonaduce, who hosts a morning show on KZOK in Seattle, was making an appearance at the casino when a woman asked for a kiss. ""The first lady in line ... says 'I love your radio show. I loved you on the ""Partridge Family."" Can you kiss me?' And I said, 'Sure,'"" Bonaduce told CNN affiliate KIRO-TV. That's when, according to Bonaduce, the woman wrapped both arms around his head and sunk her teeth into his check, near his left ear. ""They were tiny little Chucky teeth. Man, they just gnawed like piranhas,"" Bonaduce said. ""People are trying to pull her off me ... I'm screaming like a baby."" Chucky is a reference to the villain in the ""Child's Play"" horror film series about a murderous, possessed doll with a bad attitude and a mouth full of sharp chompers. ""It was so painful,"" said Bonaduce, who was also at the casino to serve as master of ceremonies for a concert by Hells Belles, an all-female AC/DC tribute band. ""It was ... as if someone wadded up 10 lit cigarettes and stuck them on your face, but they didn't go out, they just stayed that hot."" Bonaduce said his first thought after the attack was ""bath salts."" Bath salts are a class of designer drugs that contain amphetamine-like chemicals and were initially blamed in a May attack in Miami in which a naked man chewed off part of another man's face. Tests later showed the man had smoked pot. Bonaduce said he won't file charges in the attack, saying he's certain the woman had lost her grasp on reality. ""I think she was truly, truly delusional. I don't think she had any idea what she did."" CNN's Maggie Schneider contributed to this report.","A fan asked for a kiss and then bit him on the cheek .

"(CNN) -- The family -- mom, dad and two kids -- left their home looking like they meant to be back in a few minutes. But surveillance video caught what appears to be the four of them walking across the border into Mexico. There's been no word of them since. Now the investigation into the disappearance of the Southern California family in 2010 is being taken over by the FBI, authorities in California announced. Since Joseph McStay, his wife, Summer, and their two young children, Gianni, and Joseph Mateo, vanished more than three years ago, the San Diego County Sheriff's Department has been leading the search. ""Due to the fact that the family is believed to be out of the country, and because minor children are involved, the primary investigative responsibility for the case is being transferred to the FBI,"" Lt. Glenn Giannantonio of the San Diego County's department said in a prepared statement Tuesday. Three years later, no sign of missing family . ""The FBI is the most appropriate law enforcement agency to continue the investigation since they have significant experience and investigative assets in foreign countries. The sheriff's department will continue participating in the investigation in a supporting role."" The McStays were last seen or heard from on February 4, 2010. When police entered their home in Fallbrook, California, more than 10 days later, they found eggs on the kitchen counter and bowls of popcorn in the living room. Their two dogs were left unattended in the residence. The family's locked and abandoned Isuzu Trooper had been located on February 8 in San Ysidro, just two blocks from the Mexican border. Surveillance video taken that night shows a family fitting the description of the McStays walking into Mexico. ""We do believe the family on the tape going into Mexico is that of the McStays,"" Giannantonio told CNN earlier this year. Joseph McStay's mother welcomed the FBI's involvement. ""I'm very happy for this,"" Susan Blake said to CNN Tuesday evening. ""I'm happy to get more of the international part of that. Now, it can reach across to all other countries. It doesn't mean they are necessarily in Mexico, but it will keep their names and faces out there. It's just a big benefit."" Three years without a clue have taken a heavy toll on Blake. Previously she had expressed doubt that the people in the video were her son and his family, noting that his asthma medicine was left in the car and there were no car seats for the children. ""I just don't know what to think anymore, ""she said Tuesday, ""if they are in Mexico, or even if my son is alive. These are answers that I need. And these children, I just wonder what they look like. Once they find them are they going to remember us?"" ""I hope they solve it, so everybody can get some closure,"" said Joseph McStay's brother, Michael McStay. ""It's been over three years, and it's been wearing on everybody, all the family members. So I'm hoping something comes up and we can get some resolution.""

"Tokyo (CNN) -- A Japanese court Friday sentenced two American servicemen to prison for a rape committed last year while they were on duty at a U.S. military base in Okinawa. The Naha District Court handed down a sentence of 10 years to Navy Seaman Christopher Daniel Browning and nine years to Petty Officer Skyler A Dozierwalker for raping a Japanese woman after attacking her in a parking lot. The rape occurred in October 2012. At the time, both men were visiting from Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas. After their arrests, Lt. Gen. Salvatore Angelella, commander of U.S. forces in Japan, put troops at Okinawa's Kadena Air Base on a curfew and apologized to the victim. The curfew restricts military personnel to the base, a personal home or hotel between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. The incident has prompted a women's group in Okinawa to call for more restrictions on what U.S. military personnel can do when they are off-base. Violent crimes, especially rapes, by U.S. troops in Japan have divided the two countries for decades. The issue came to a peak in 1995 when a sailor and two Marines -- both American -- were convicted of raping a 12-year-old girl. Tens of thousands of Okinawans took to the streets at the time, demanding that the United States leave the island south of Japan's main islands. In that case, the U.S. military at first declined to turn over the suspects to Japanese authorities. But in the most recent case, the suspects were in Japanese custody almost immediately. The alleged attack took place two months after a U.S. Marine was arrested, accused of assaulting and molesting a woman in Naha, the capital of Okinawa. Relations between the U.S. military and Okinawans have already been stressed over the U.S. Marine Corps' deployment of MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft to a base on the island. Some residents are concerned because the Osprey has had a reputation for crashing. The Okinawan community has long been against the presence of the U.S. military, which has announced that thousands of Marines will be moved to a base in Guam.

"(CNN) -- Vote counting was under way Tuesday in the Democratic Republic of Congo after millions went to the polls in the giant nation's second postwar election amid logistical challenges. Voting was extended for a second day Tuesday in some polling stations that experienced delays, including in the capital, which had heavy police presence. In polling stations that opened on time, election workers were counting the votes. Citizens lined up Monday to vote in the presidential and parliamentary polls nationwide. In the capital of Kinshasa, citizens waded through muddy roads to cast their votes in an election that has sparked tension in the central African nation. ""Some had traveled for days using motorcycle taxis and bicycles to reach polling stations,"" said Herman Nzeza, the Congo representative of FreeFair DRC, a nonpartisan group that raises awareness of the election. ""That's why it was even more frustrating for them to get there and find their names missing. Some were being sent to other polling stations to find their names ... I saw women carrying babies walking in the mud to get to the next polling stations."" With more than 30 million voters, thousands of polling stations and lack of paved roads and basic infrastructure, Congo's elections were a logistical nightmare. Issues included tardy election workers and blackouts at the end of the day despite extended vote hours, said Nzeza, who visited polling stations in the capital. ""We don't know what was happening to the ballots when the lights were off,"" he said. There were also claims of ballot stuffing and the denial of poll access to registered voters in some areas, according to FreeFair DRC. Nzeza said his organization got reports of three deaths in Katanga over election-related chaos, and was working to get more information. Stacks of ballots with long lists of the more than 18,000 people running for 500 parliamentary seats was also a challenge for the nation whose majority citizens don't have access to education. The presidential and parliamentary polls are critical in the central African nation struggling to rebuild years after a conflict left millions dead and displaced entire regions. Incumbent Joseph Kabila, who took over after his father died in 2001 and was elected in Congo's first democratic election five years later, is one of 11 presidential contenders. Supporters of leading opposition candidate, Etienne Tshisekedi, have vowed to take to the streets in protest if the polls are not fair. ""This is our version of the Arab uprising ... we want him (the incumbent) out. This country is rich in resources, but we have turned into world spectators. This frustration has lasted too long,"" said Paul Efambe, 42, who lives in the capital Kinshasa. Fraud allegations started before the vote. The opposition maintains that the leader of the electoral commission was picked by Kabila and thus cannot conduct a fair election, said Albert Moleka, a spokesman for Tshisekedi. Tshisekedi's party had called for delayed poll, saying the government does not have adequate resources to meet the election needs. ""No country is perfect, but we should be able to conduct organized elections. We should respect the rights of the Congolese to have good elections, and our country does not have the facilities -- even roads -- to do that,"" he said. Analysts fear the election outcome could plunge the nation into chaos again years after a 1998-2003 conflict that left 5 million dead as a result of fighting, diseases and starvation. Clashes have erupted in days leading up to the vote, with at least two people killed when supporters of the two frontrunners hurled rocks at one another Saturday, Human Rights Watch said. Stability in Congo -- which borders nine mostly vulnerable countries -- is vital to Africa's Great Lakes region. The years of war affected at least six neighboring nations, some of which are still battling rebel movements spawned during the conflict. Despite Congo's vast resources including cobalt, gold, copper and tantalum, the fledgling democracy is mired in poverty and conflict especially in its eastern region, a hot spot for the so-called ""conflict minerals"" that activists say are used to fund rebel movements in the area. Results are scheduled to be announced on December 6.","In the capital of Kinshasa, voters wade through muddy roads to cast their votes .

"Washington (CNN) -- In the bitter political debate over health care reform two years ago, one of the most contentious issues was a proposed advisory board that would recommend how to achieve needed but as-yet-unreachable Medicare savings. Opponents dubbed the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) a ""death panel"" that would ration medical coverage for senior citizens based on cost and effectiveness, rather than decisions reached between patient and doctor. Supporters called such rhetoric overheated and misleading, arguing the advisory board was necessary to motivate a reluctant health care industry to adopt cost-cutting reforms that Congress had proven unwilling or unable to impose. Now the House will consider repealing the advisory board provision this week in an election-year move that rekindles the fiery emotions of the health care fight back in 2009 and 2010. While the repeal effort is expected to eventually fall short, it gives opponents of health care reform a rallying point for their continued efforts to undermine the 2010 law. Some of the rhetoric from two years earlier has re-emerged, such as warnings of a government takeover of health care. ""What we oppose is the president deciding who gets what,"" Rep. Tom Price, R-Georgia, told a news conference Wednesday. Earlier this week, Republican Rep. Scott DesJarlais of Tennessee told reporters that the IPAB panel was ""designed to put a Washington bureaucrat between the patient and their doctor."" That's not the intent or the reality of the advisory board, insisted Dr. Donald Berwick, the former administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. For example, the law targeted by the repeal effort specifically forbids the advisory board from rationing health care to reduce spending. ""We're in a very polarized era. It's hard to have rational conversations with people"" on the issue, Berwick told CNN. Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said this week that ""charges that the board is going to be able to deny people care are just flat out wrong."" ""The law makes every effort to restrict the board so that it can't do that,"" Van de Water said. ""And in fact, if anything, the charge is the opposite of the truth."" The 15-member IPAB board would comprise independent experts to recommend Medicare cost reductions starting in 2015 if Congress and the health care industry and insurers fail to agree on $300 billion in savings called for in the health care reform law. Designed as a nonpolitical solution in the event of legislative stalemate, the panel's recommendations do not require congressional approval but can be offset by Congress. Some critics, including Democrats who back health care reform, cite the independent board's relative autonomy as a reason for eliminating it. In addition, Republican sponsors have added long-desired tort reform provisions against frivolous lawsuits to offset the cost of eliminating the panel intended to bring Medicare savings. However, the legal lobby and many Democrats oppose tort reforms, raising questions about the final makeup of the bill. According to Berwick, opposition to the IPAB panel breaks down into three groups: a ""significant minority"" that hates the 2010 health care reform law and wants to scare people about it; political opponents of President Barack Obama trying to hurt his re-election chances, and health care providers and insurers ""doing quite well in the status quo"" who are unwilling to commit to Medicare reforms. Despite such opposition, no one disputes the need to change Medicare in order to keep it solvent in coming decades, as baby boomers reach retirement age and flood its ranks. Republicans who have long opposed Medicare want to lower the cost by eventually making it a subsidized program instead of a government-run system. The House Republican budget for 2013 made public Tuesday would offer future seniors a choice of staying in the traditional fee-for-service Medicare plan or opting for a Medicare-approved private plan, all of which would be available via a new Medicare exchange. No matter which plan they chose, including the traditional Medicare plan, seniors would receive a government subsidy to help pay for their choice. The 2010 health care reform law sought cost reductions in Medicare through more efficient delivery of services. For example, it envisioned increased collaboration through electronic medical records to reduce repetitive and costly tests, as well as basing reimbursement on quality of care rather than quantity of services provided. ""It's conceivable you could ratchet down on payments for routine MRIs or CAT scans and use some of that money to shore up payments to providers and ... make the whole system a little more efficient,"" noted Uwe Reinhardt, a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. Under the law, the IPAB panel would step in if targeted cost reductions went unmet. Those seeking repeal of the advisory board say it will lead to indiscriminate cost-cutting rather than the intended reforms to maintain Medicare's long-term solvency. Rep. Nan Hayworth, R-New York, who practiced ophthalmology for 16 years prior to her election to Congress in 2010, said Medicare reimbursements already were being lowered to a point where some physicians cannot afford to treat Medicare patients. ""That is the last thing our seniors need,"" Hayworth said Wednesday. ""In many practices across the country, that threat will only increase with IPAB."" Rep. Tim Griffin, R-Arkansas, said at a Monday news conference that the advisory board ""will do nothing to change how Medicare works,"" adding ""it will simply say we've run out of money, and now we're cutting."" The American Medical Association, a major physician's advocacy organization, also wants to repeal the advisory board even though it supported the broader health care reform law. It already wrestles with what has been a 15-year problem involving Medicare reimbursements that exemplifies the difficulty of reforming the program. The Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate provision enacted in 1997 limits increases in Medicare costs to the same rate of growth in the gross domestic product. Under the formula, the costs have repeatedly risen higher than planned. Rather than cutting payments to Medicare doctors, Congress has regularly authorized extra money to make up the difference, with the latest so-called ""doc fix"" set to expire at the end of 2012. That means doctors face a 30% cut in Medicare reimbursements from the government in January, and now the IPAB panel would be empowered to recommend steeper cuts, AMA board Chairman Dr. Robert Wah told CNN in a telephone interview. The AMA wants Congress to stabilize funding for Medicare reimbursements for five years to allow doctors time to work out reforms outlined in the 2010 health care legislation. According to Wah, the fear is that the IPAB panel will recommend across-the-board spending cuts that drive doctors away from Medicare patients while failing to inspire the necessary reforms. ""A board that doesn't have to answer to anybody and has the latitude to make dramatic cuts has consequences for our patients,"" said Wah, later adding: ""It's very hard to do that kind of innovation when there is uncertainty and the threat of large cuts."" For Berwick, the question is, ""how do you create the political and social will for uncomfortable changes?"" ""The evidence so far is that motivation solely from inside health care, changing itself, is insufficient,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Official Chinese media have hailed the successful test flight of China's first domestically made jumbo air freighter. Few details were released about the flight, made Saturday, but the test indicates China's ambitions to add a heavy freighter to its capabilities and match better against traditional air powers, Russia and the United States. Other large air freighters already flying include the Russian-built Ilyushin Il-76, the U.S.-made Boeing C-17 Globemaster III and, largest of them all, the Ukrainian Antonov An-225. The four-engine Yun-20, or Transport-20, is a huge, multi-function airfreighter that can perform various long distance air transport tasks targeting cargo and passengers, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said. ""The successful maiden flight of the Y-20 is important in promoting China's economic and national defense buildup, as well as improving its emergency response and humanitarian aid abilities,"" the Ministry of National Defense said on its website. The flight boosts China's presence as a global aircraft manufacturer as well as its military capabilities. ""A genuine strategic air power must possess a strong power projection capability, which is highly reliant on large aircraft, namely a strategic air freighter and a strategic bomber,"" said Wang Yanan, deputy editor in chief at Aerospace Knowledge magazine and a military analyst, in a China Daily report. Late last year, a domestic order of 50 Chinese-built C919 commercial jets provided further evidence of China's growing stake in the aviation industry. The C919 is China's answer to the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 -- a single-aisle, 168-seat, narrow-body commercial liner produced by Chinese state-run aircraft manufacturer Comac (Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China). Little is known about the Y-20, with a China Daily report stating the aircraft is believed to have been developed by the Xi'an Aircraft Industry, a subsidiary of Aviation Industry Corp. of China, the major military aircraft manufacturer. The same report indicated the plane had a payload of around 66 metric tons, big enough to transport combat tanks. According to China Daily, the official codename of the aircraft is Kunpeng, named after a legendary bird in Chinese mythology that can fly thousands of kilometers. The Y-20 will continue to undergo experiments and test flights, local media reported. CNN's CY Xu contributed to this report.","It is the first flight of China's new jumbo airfreighter .

"(CNN) -- Maybe there's something in the snow up in Minnesota. That hearty Midwestern state consistently has the highest rate of voter participation in the country. In 2008, 78% of eligible people voted in the presidential election, according to an analysis from George Mason University. That number masks an amazing fact: Some districts of Minnesota turn out more than 90% of the eligible population, according to Minnesota Secretary of State Mark Ritchie. None of that seems out of the ordinary to Ritchie, whose office handles elections. In fact, he says the state should do more -- that statewide voter participation should be as near to 100% as possible. Change the List Tumblr: Where does your state rank? ""We're happy. We're proud. We stand up and shout,"" he told me by phone, referring to the state's top rank in voting. ""But an average means there's some above and some below (the average). Like every place, our young adults vote in a lower percentage than older adults. And we've discovered that's because there are more barriers for them, and we're working to tear down those barriers."" The state already has torn down plenty. I'm looking to Minnesota for solutions to low voter participation in other states. I recently visited Hawaii because the Aloha State had the absolute lowest rate of participation in the 2008 election. Less than half of eligible people voted. As the Pew Charitable Trusts' election expert David Becker told me, what works for one state may not work for another. Still, it makes sense to at least consider a few things Minnesota is doing right. ""I do think it's worthwhile for the states to experiment,"" Becker said. With that caveat in mind, here are five factors that likely contribute to Minnesota's status as a voting paradise. Take a look and let me know what you think in the comments section below. 1. Same-day voter registration: Americans who want to vote should be able to decide that on Election Day. That's true in Minnesota, where you can walk into your polling place, register and cast a ballot -- all at the same time. It's not true in many states, where voter registration closes days or weeks before Election Day. Research shows that states with same-day registration have turnout rates 5% to 7% higher than those that don't, according to Michael McDonald at George Mason University. The drawback, some would argue, is an increased risk of voter fraud. Ritchie, the Minnesota secretary of state, told me that hasn't posed a real threat, and the state has been using the system since the 1970s. ""Imagine you're registering a voter that's standing in front of you versus registering someone through a form in the mail. Which one of those has more integrity? Obviously the person who is standing in front of you."" The state checks on Election-Day registrations against computer databases the next day to catch duplicates, he said. 2. Civic culture: It's harder to quantify, but Minnesota's civic-minded culture may play a role in its high turnout. About 38% of Minnesotans volunteer, putting it third in the country, according to the federal government. Ritchie told me people in Minnesota take pride in their state -- and they see voting as part of their civic duty. Becker and McDonald pointed to this factor, too, noting that it could be why the state implements laws designed to encourage high rates of voter participation. ""Minnesotans take pride in the fact that they are always in the top in turnout,"" Becker said. 3. Raising awareness: The fact that people see voting as part of their civic duty may be no accident. Minnesota has programs that encourage young people to volunteer as polling place monitors before they're eligible to vote. Schools use voting machines for high school elections -- like those for prom king and queen -- so that kids are familiar with the process. The state's Vote in Honor of a Veteran campaign asks people to wear a sticker that has the name of a loved one who fought for the right to vote in this country. Ritchie wears one in honor of his dad, a Marine in World War II. 4. No voter ID laws: For now, at least, the state has few barriers to voting. That could change if a proposed amendment to the state's constitution passes in November. The amendment would require voters who cast ballots in person to present a government photo ID or cast a certified provisional ballot. One consequence, as Ritchie writes in the Minn Post, is that voters may not be able to register and vote on the same day. That could have a negative impact on voter participation. The benefits of making it easy for people to register and vote outweigh the risks of fraud. 5. A vibrant political scene: Close and contentious elections can boost turnout, and Minnesota has had plenty of those in recent years. The state is home to polarizing politicians like Michele Bachmann and Al Franken. Additionally, according to Ritchie, it has seven ""functioning political parties,"" meaning there's little reason to feel disenfranchised. Remember governor/wrestler Jesse Ventura? He ran as a Reform Party candidate -- and won. In Hawaii, by comparison, all levels of political life are more or less dominated by the Democrats, giving some voters the sense their votes don't matter.","Minnesota has the highest voter turnout rate in the country .

"(CNN) -- The prospect of arguably the two best club sides in the world contesting the European Champions League final remains a possibility after Spanish giants Barcelona and Real Madrid were kept apart in the semifinal draw in Nyon, Switzerland. Current Spanish league leaders Barca were drawn against Bayern Munich, who have already wrapped up the Bundesliga title this season, while Real Madrid will play Borussia Dortmund. ""It's our chance to show that Bayern Munich has improved since 2009 (when Barcelona beat Bayern 4-0) and that we can now compare ourselves to the best teams,"" Bayern honorary president Karl-Heinz Rummenigge told reporters on Friday. ""It will be a good comparison between the Bundesliga and the Spanish league."" Last season Real and Dortmund won the Spanish and German league titles. While Real have been off the pace in the Spanish league this season -- Jose Mourinho's side are 12 points behind Barca -- the Madrid club beat their Catalan rivals recently in the Spanish Cup semifinals. In the Bundesliga, Dortmund have also lagged as Bayern have romped to the title, but Jurgen Klopp's side have looked a different proposition in the Champions League and are the only unbeaten side in this season's competition. Dortmund got the better of Real when the two sides met in the group stages, with the German side beating Real 2-1 in their Westfalenstadion and then securing an impressive 2-2 draw in Madrid to finish top of their section. The semifinal meeting between Barca and Bayern has an added twist in that the Catalan's side former coach coach Pep Guardiola will replace the German club's coach Jupp Heynckes at the end of the season. Heynckes was Real's coach in 1998, when Madrid won their first title in the competition in more than 30 years. Real are chasing a 10th European Cup, although their last win was back in 2002. Their arch-rivals Barcelona and Bayern both have four and Borussia weigh in with their single victory in 1997 when they upset favourites Juventus 3-1 in the final. The semifinal will be played on 23 and 24 April, with the return legs on 30 April and 1 May to decide who will meet in the Wembley final in London on May 25. In the Europa League, Chelsea will face Switzerland's Basel, while Turkish side Fenerbahce face Portugal's Benfica on April 25 and May 2 for the right to contest the final in Amsterdam on May 15.","Barcelona will play Bayern Munich in the Euroepan Champions League semifinals .

"(CNN) -- While Zlatan Ibrahimovic showed more evidence of his importance to Paris Saint-Germain on Saturday, Barcelona responded with an ominous warning of the club's powers even without Lionel Messi. With the four-time world player of the year battling to be fit for Wednesday's visit by the French league leaders, having injured his hamstring in last week's 2-2 draw, Cesc Fabregas put up his hand for a role in the second leg of the Champions League quarterfinal. In a Messi-esque performance, the Spain midfielder took his chance to impress as he scored his first hat-trick for Barcelona in a 5-0 thrashing of Mallorca that kept the Catalan side 13 points clear of second-placed Real Madrid in La Liga. Alexis Sanchez, another midfielder who has struggled to consistently impress since his 2011 arrival at the Camp Nou, chimed in with the other two goals. The match was also notable for the second-half introduction of French defender Eric Adibal, making his first senior appearance since his liver transplant last April. By that stage Tito Vilanova's side, much-changed from the trip to Paris, were already five goals ahead as both Fabregas and Sanchez netted twice in the opening period, toying with the visiting defense. Fabregas was taken off as a precaution after completing his treble with an assist from Andres Iniesta, but Sanchez hobbled off late with an injury that casts doubt on his fitness for the PSG clash. Barca hope to have Messi back for that match, as his injury is not as bad as feared. The Argentine netted the opening goal of the first leg, his 57th this season, but it was Ibrahimovic who had the last word as he set up a late equalizer. The Sweden forward, who was able to play -- and also score -- last week after having his European suspension halved, has now netted 26 league goals this season following another opportunistic effort in Saturday's 2-0 win at Rennes. Ibrahimovic finished off from close range in time added on after halftime substitute David Beckham chipped the keeper, denying the veteran Englishman his first goal since signing in January. Jeremy Menez had earlier scored a fine individual goal as Qatar-funded PSG moved seven points clear at the top of the table after the club's first win at Rennes since 2002. Real Madrid, meanwhile, came from behind to crush Levante 5-1 as Mesut Ozil scored two late goals after fellow substitute Cristiano Ronaldo also netted -- his 29th in the league, second best behind Messi's 43. Striker Gonzalo Higuain volleyed a spectacular equalizer while Kaka put Real 2-1 ahead at the break with a penalty. It continued Real's form from last week's 3-0 Champions League win over Galatasaray, ahead of Tuesday's trip to Turkey. The Istanbul side went seven points clear in the Turkish Super League on Saturday with a 3-1 win at home to Mersin, as veteran striker Didier Drogba scored twice. Real Sociedad consolidated fourth place in Spain with a 4-2 win against Malaga which established a four-point lead over the visitors with eight games to play. It dented any hopes Malaga have of playing in next season's Champions League -- if the club's appeal against a suspension for financial fair play discrepancies is successful -- and placed even more importance on Tuesday's second leg of the quarterfinal tie away to German side Borussia Dortmund, which is level at 0-0. Juventus bounced back from last week's Champions League defeat against Bayern Munich by moving 12 points clear in Italy's Serie A with a 2-1 win over bottom club Pescara on Saturday. Montenegro striker Mirko Vucinic scored two late goals before a long-range effort from Emmanuel Cascione ensured a tense finish.

"(CNN) -- In what activists call a victory for Latinos, the U.S. government has resolved allegations relating to a series of warrantless home raids by immigration agents and must now follow new guidelines for conducing similar operations in the future. The terms were part of a federal court settlement approved on Thursday in New York between Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and nearly two dozen plaintiffs who joined in a class-action suit. The suit that was closely watched by immigrant communities who alleged ICE agents forced their way into eight homes of Latino families on New York's Long Island in 2006 and 2007 without legal justification. ""This is a positive step in the ability to hold ICE officers accountable for misconduct,"" said Axel Caballero, founder of My Cuentame, a nonprofit immigrant-rights filmmaker. ""We hope officers and the agency are wise enough to not ignore the decision. But this is not enough. This is just the beginning of change that needs to be done."" The lead plaintiff, Adriana Aguilar, said agents pounded on doors in the middle of the night and came into her East Hampton home even though they were denied entry. She shared the home with her parents, siblings and children, who are all U.S. citizens. ""ICE is known for tactics like showing up unexpectedly and banging on doors, a common strategy that has been employed fairly routinely,"" said Camille Mackler, director of training and technical assistance at the New York Immigration Coalition. ""But now with this change in federal policy, hopefully people's basic constitutional rights won't be violated."" Under revised guidelines for cases without warrants, ICE must establish a policy requiring that agents, when feasible, obtain permission to enter a home in a language residents can understand. There are also new restrictions for when searches can be conducted on property surrounding a home. The government, as part of the settlement, also agreed to pay $1 million and drop or put aside immigration proceedings in several cases related to the raids. ""Undocumented immigrants have less rights than U.S. citizens would but they do have basic constitutional protection that gives them the right to be protected from unreasonable search and seizure,"" explained Mackler. ICE declined to comment on the settlement. CNN's Jaqueline Hurtado contributed to this report.","Class-action suit revolved around raids of homes in New York .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama's goal of putting 1 million electric cars on U.S. roads by 2015 could run into a huge roadblock -- the American consumer. According to a report released Wednesday by researchers at Indiana University, automakers are unlikely to manufacture enough cars to reach the president's goal because of a potential lack of buyer demand. Nissan and General Motors, makers of the Leaf and Volt, respectively, already have the capacity to produce enough cars to meet the goal. Serious questions remain, however, about the level of desire among potential buyers worried about cost, ease of use and likely resale value. ""After the early adopters, what is going to motivate the mainstream people to buy the vehicles?"" asked Gurminder Bedi, a retired Ford Motor Co. executive and one of the authors of the report. ""Buying an electric vehicle just by itself, because it's better for gas mileage, will be a good factor. But that's not going to be sufficient."" Bedi nevertheless praised Obama's goal, noting that it ""has really jump started"" the market for electric cars. ""I'd say there will be more electric vehicles by 2015 than there would have been if that initiative hadn't been started,"" he said. In 2008, there were nearly 57,000 electric cars on U.S. roads, according to an estimate by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The administration has created a number of incentives for consumers to purchase electric cars, including a $7,500 tax credit to first-time buyers.","Study: Obama may not reach goal of putting 1 million electric cars on U.S. roads by 2015 .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano apologized Thursday after some veterans groups were offended by a department report about right-wing extremism. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano apologized to offended veterans Thursday morning. The report said extremist groups may try to attract veterans returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It also said extremists also may use the recession and the election of the nation's first African-American president to recruit members. The American Legion was among those who objected to the report's mention of veterans. ""I think it is important for all of us to remember that Americans are not the enemy. The terrorists are,"" the American Legion's national commander, David K. Rehbein, said in a letter to Napolitano. Napolitano apologized on CNN on Thursday morning. ""I know that some veterans groups were offended by the fact that veterans were mentioned in this assessment, so I apologize for that offense. It was certainly not intended,"" she told CNN's ""American Morning."" She said the report was an assessment -- not an accusation -- and said she would meet with leaders of veterans groups next week.  Watch Napolitano talk about Mexico, apology to veterans » . She noted that the Veterans of Foreign Wars, which bills itself as the nation's largest combat veterans group, defended the report. amFIX: Full Napolitano interview . Glen M. Gardner Jr., the national commander of the 2.2 million-member VFW, said the assessment ""should have been worded differently"" but served a vital purpose. ""A government that does not assess internal and external security threats would be negligent of a critical public responsibility,"" he said in a statement. The report mentioned numerous factors that could strengthen right-wing extremists, including anger over illegal immigration and the poor economy. Yet it was the section on veterans that caused controversy among conservative politicians and some veterans. It said ""the return of military veterans facing significant challenges reintegrating into their communities could lead to the potential emergence of terrorist groups or lone-wolf extremists capable of carrying out violent attacks."" It cited Timothy McVeigh, who returned from military service and went on to bomb the federal building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, in 1995. ""Timothy McVeigh was only one of more than 42 million veterans who have worn this nation's uniform during wartime,"" wrote Rehbein, the American Legion commander. ""To continue to use McVeigh as an example of the stereotypical 'disgruntled military veteran' is as unfair as using Osama bin Laden as the sole example of Islam."" The report, which was prepared in coordination with the FBI, was published last week. It was distributed to federal, state and local law enforcement officials. Mainstream media outlets picked up the story after it was reported by conservative bloggers.  Watch how the report sparked objections » . Though the nine-page report said it had ""no specific information that domestic right-wing terrorists are currently planning acts of violence,"" it said real-estate foreclosures, unemployment and tight credit ""could create a fertile recruiting environment for right-wing extremists and even result in confrontations between such groups and government authorities similar to those in the past."" The report compared the current climate with that of the 1990s, saying a recession, criticism over outsourcing of jobs, and a perceived threat to U.S. power at that time fueled a ""resurgence"" of right-wing extremism. However, it said, ""Despite similarities to the climate of the 1990s, the threat posed by lone wolves and small terrorist cells is more pronounced than in past years."" It warned that the groups may use proposed restrictions on firearms and the debate on immigration as recruiting tools, and said the groups may try to reach out to veterans returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh decried the report on Tuesday, saying, ""There is not one instance they can cite as evidence where any of these right-wing groups have done anything,"" according to a transcript of his remarks on his Web site. ""You have a report from Janet Napolitano and Barack Obama, Department of Homeland Security, portraying standard, ordinary, everyday conservatives as posing a bigger threat to this country than al Qaeda terrorists or genuine enemies of this country like Kim Jong Il,"" he said, referring to the leader of North Korea. Michael Savage, another conservative commentator, also criticized the report. ""What does Big Sis say these right-wingers are concerned about?"" he wrote on his Web site, referring to Napolitano. ""Illegal aliens, the increasing power of the federal government, gun grabs, abortion and the loss of U.S. national sovereignty. In other words, anyone who is worried about preserving our borders, language, and culture is on Big Sis' watch list."" In a written statement Wednesday, Napolitano said the agency is on ""the lookout for criminal and terrorist activity but we do not -- nor will we ever -- monitor ideology or political beliefs."" She said she was ""briefed"" on the general topic, which ""struck a nerve as someone personally involved in the Timothy McVeigh prosecution."" Napolitano said in her statement that she will tell Rehbein face-to-face that the Department of Homeland Security honors veterans and employs thousands of them, including Deputy Secretary Jane Holl Lute. The Obama administration in January issued a warning about left-wing extremists. Both reports were initiated during the administration of former President George W. Bush.","Janet Napolitano regrets line in report on extremist groups .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- HSBC, Europe's largest bank by market capitalization, will lay off 14,000 employees around the world to save $2 billion to $3 billion by 2016, the company announced Wednesday. The layoffs -- representing more than 5% of its 254,000 workers worldwide -- will come on top of some 42,000 job cuts in the past two years as the bank has sought to reorganize its operations to increase profits and efficiency in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis. ""HSBC in my view is terribly bloated,"" says Christine Houston, Managing Director of Executive Search Group International in Hong Kong. ""If you compare them to Citi, UBS, a lot of the American banks who did their layoffs closer to 2008, HSBC is just an anomaly. The number of staff is just incredible."" That realignment could see redundancies in HSBC's non-core markets -- ""probably Europe and South America"" -- while Asia will continue to be ""a growth market,"" predicts Jonathan Hollands, managing director of executive search firm Carraway Group. An HSBC spokesperson said ""all geographies and business will be reviewed but there are no specific details."" This week's layoff announcement had been widely expected. In March, HSBC's CEO Stuart Gulliver had said he would ""fixate on costs"" in 2013. ""They're still not finished with redundancies,"" cautioned Hollands of Carraway Group. ""They are still restructuring,"" But HSBC's need to still lay off workers ""is probably the exception"" than the rule when comparing it to other global banks, says Houston of Executive Search Group International. ""It very much depends on the institution and what lines of business they are in. U.S firms have really tried to cut to the bone. They might exit some businesses and then you would see redundancies...(like in) mergers and acquisitions and investment banking."" Hollands believes other major banking corporations need to follow HSBC's streamlining. ""(Singapore-based) DBS and OCBC could do with that sort of realignment,"" says Hollands. ""Business banking -- they're very good at that. They should be focused on that. The same for (Hong Kong-headquartered) Standard Chartered. UBS has got to ask itself 'what is our core business' and 'do we give up on wealth management'."" Similar questions exist for larger global banks including Deutche Bank, Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse, adds Hollands. Looking ahead, analysts agree that job loss will occur at differing speeds depending on the sector. ""We are seeing an increase in wealth management (jobs), an increase in risk management compliance that deals with regulatory aspects,"" says Hollands. ""We're seeing a dropoff (in jobs) of cash equity sales and structured product demand and a big drop in investment banking in Asia.","HSBC, Europe's largest bank, to lay off up to 14,000 staff between 2014 and 2016 .

"(CNN) -- Leeland Eisenberg's latest jaunt away from authorities' watch lasted less than a day, police say. Eisenberg, who took hostages six years ago at one of Hillary Clinton's campaign offices, was arrested Monday morning at a community resource center in Manchester, New Hampshire, hours after officials learned he wasn't at a Manchester halfway house where he was supposed to be, police in the city said. Authorities had said they considered Sunday afternoon's disappearance an escape because Eisenberg did not let anyone know he was leaving, as he is required to do. Eisenberg will be arraigned Monday at a Hillsborough County courthouse on an escape charge, and then will be sent to state prison in Concord, state Department of Corrections spokesman Jeff Lyons said . This is at least the second time Eisenberg, 52, left authorities wondering about his whereabouts. He was released in 2009 after serving two thirds of a three-year sentence. But in February 2010, he violated his probation by cutting off his GPS tracking bracelet. He was arrested about a day later and eventually received a new sentence of 3Â½ to 7 years. He is eligible for parole in August. Eisenberg has a history of mental illness and substance-abuse problems, authorities say. In 2007, he entered Clinton's campaign office in Rochester, New Hampshire, with road flares strapped to his chest. He claimed he had a bomb, and he held several hostages for five hours. Clinton was in Washington at the time. In an interview with CNN in 2007, Eisenberg said he took the hostages to raise awareness about mental health issues. ""I wanted to sacrifice myself for mental illness and bring about the discussion about mental illness,"" Eisenberg said. Furthermore, he said, ""I wanted the police to kill me."" He was convicted of multiple counts of kidnapping, criminal threatening and false reports of explosives. CNN's Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","Leeland Eisenberg arrested in Manchester, New Hampshire .

"Singapore (CNN) -- Holding a black noose over her head, Singaporean forensics expert Lim Chin-Chin explained Wednesday to a packed courtroom how re-enactments showed that American engineer Shane Todd would have been able to hang himself from a similar black strap attached to his bathroom door. ""One final push and he lands,"" she said, describing how a chair could be shoved away by the feet so a body would drop. This was the third day of the inquiry into the death of Todd, who was found hanging in his Singapore apartment on June 24. Singapore's medical examiner concluded that Todd committed suicide, but Todd's parents disagreed and hired a pathologist in the U.S. who -- based on Singapore's autopsy report and photographs of the body --suggested there was evidence that his death was a homicide. Singaporean lawyers hired by the Todd family have suggested Singapore's police work was sloppy and that an assumption of suicide led police to neglect other evidence. In court, the Todds' lawyers asserted a possible crime scene was altered: Todd's hanging body was cut down and laid on the floor and a nearby chair moved before a forensics team and photographer arrived. Police maintain this follows standard procedure. U.S. senators seek to stop funding Singapore firm after American's death . On Tuesday a senior police inspector told the court it wasn't necessary to take fingerprint or DNA swabs at the scene because there were no ""tampering marks"" on Todd's apartment door, and no ""signs of ransack"" in his apartment. The 31-year-old Todd had been working for a year and a half at the Singapore government's Institute of Microelectronics (IME) when he decided to quit his job and return home to the United States. He was part of a team researching uses of Gallium Nitride (GaN), a semiconductor that can operate at extremely high temperatures. Documents found on Todd's laptop after his death reportedly indicate IME may have had plans with Chinese telecom giant Huawei to co-develop an amplifier using GaN. Such a device could have both military as well as civilian uses. Todd's parents believe their son may have been murdered over his knowledge of such a sensitive project. They say their son had warned them his life was in danger. Both IME and Huawei deny that any joint GaN project ever went forward. The lawyers for Singapore's Attorney General say they plan to show evidence that Todd had little experience in GaN work and ""found it difficult to cope."" The state also says Todd's laptop shows he accessed suicide-related web pages in the months before his death, with a search in March on how to tie a hangman's noose. Lim, who heads Singapore's main Forensics Lab, walked through a detailed presentation of simulations intended to recreate the evidence found in Todd's apartment -- the compression marks on the doorframe caused by a hanging weight, and floor scratches that matched the movement of a chair which Todd could have pushed away with his feet as he hanged himself. READ MORE: Montana family disputes Singapore police probe into son's death . Todd's parents, who flew to Singapore from their home in Montana, watched Lim's testimony in silence as pictures of their son's dead body were displayed. But after Lim finished, Todd's mother appeared unable to continue, and requested the family's lawyers call for an end to the day's proceedings. Outside court, Rick and Mary Todd expressed disgust with the inquiry. ""What we've been discovering is that the evidence that's been presented, we can't rely on. It's been moved, it hasn't been preserved and we are trying to get to the bottom of it, if we ever will be able get to the bottom of it,"" said Rick Todd. Todd's mother, Mary, wept as she told reporters the police and Singapore's investigators had ignored evidence. ""We have given them evidence from the minute we heard that our son was hung, that he could have been murdered. We've given them computer forensic evidence, we've given them physical evidence... Why are they not looking into all of those things that add up to murder, not suicide?"" she asked ""I am very, very disappointed in this process and I want the truth to be known in Singapore."" Wednesday's inquiry also focused on Todd's phone and laptop. Peter Ong, a lawyer for the Todd family, had raised the question of whether Todd's laptop could have been hacked or remotely accessed to upload information or insert a suicide note. Singapore's technology crime forensics expert Kristen Soong testified that she had conducted several tests for viruses and that she had found no evidence of remote access or any trace of malicious software. ""There was only one user by the name of Shane to this account,"" Soong added. Ong also asked why there was activity on Todd's phone after his death, when the phone was in police custody. He introduced phone records he said showed activity over a span of five days after Todd's death. Soong told the court it was up to the police to see if there had been any misuse of the phone, to which the Todd's lawyer Ong replied, ""Apparently there may be."" The inquiry began on Monday with the testimony of Todd's friends in Singapore. Todd's girlfriend Shirley Sarmiento, a nurse in Singapore, was the first witness to be called. She had gone to his apartment on the night of June 24, concerned when he didn't answer calls or texts, and discovered his hanging body. Sarmiento testified she didn't know the details of his work but said Todd told her ""how much he hated"" it. On one occasion he told her he was ""working on something that could get him into trouble with the American government"" and that ""heavy hands"" were coming after him, though he didn't elaborate. But Todd had also confided in his girlfriend that he had been depressed since October 2011. But she said he ""did not display any suicidal tendencies."" Michael William Goodwin lived across the hall from Todd. He'd been the one who first heard the screams of Todd's girlfriend when she found his body. Goodwin testified that he and Todd talked over beers a month before he died and that he seemed very stressed. ""He told me he wanted a fresh start. He told me he hated his job,"" Goodwin said. Asked by one of the Todd's lawyers if he believed Todd had taken his life, Goodwin said Todd was always ""upbeat"" and showed ""no evidence at all that he would ever take his own life."" Asked if he was surprised to hear Todd had been taking medication for depression, Goodwin said, ""It wouldn't surprise me."" Looking out at the courtroom he said, ""Twenty people in this room"" could be suffering from depression and no one would know. Witness testimony will continue until the end of the month. The judge in the inquiry - termed the Coroner in Singapore - will issue a final report declaring whether Shane Todd committed suicide or whether the facts point to ""misadventure."" Any finding other than suicide could potentially be taken up as a criminal case. A determination of ""suicide"" by the Coroner would be considered final with no further legal recourse for the family.","Singapore is holding an inquest whether a U.S. engineer's death was correctly ruled a suicide .

Analysis: Iraq at crossroads as bombs explode . A curfew will be imposed in the province from 10 p.m. local time to 4 a.m., Iraqiya state TV reported. Sheikh Ali Hatem al-Suleiman, emir of the Dulaim tribes, told CNN the security forces were seeking to arrest him when they carried out the raid on his farm near Ramadi. He has been instrumental in setting up the so-called ""Army of Pride and Dignity,"" an armed force formed by the tribes in Ramadi and elsewhere in Anbar province.

Later, he said, dozens of Army of Pride and Dignity members tracked down the Iraqi army convoy that conducted the raid and clashed with it. Al-Suleiman said that the tribal fighters had managed to free the three farmers. ""This is it; enough is enough. We will attack every Iraqi army checkpoint in Anbar if they don't withdraw from Anbar province immediately,"" he said. ""We will not accept any talks or negotiations with the government anymore.""

We are certain that al-Maliki is a liar, the political process is just a game,"" al-Suleiman told CNN's Arwa Damon in an interview on May 5. ""Our weapons are everywhere, light, medium, and on up."" The tribes allied themselves with al Qaeda in Iraq and battled against U.S. forces for years before turning against the terrorist group in 2006. But al-Suleiman said that al Qaeda militants will not be allowed to dominate again. ""The tribes are not and will not again be a nurturing ground for terrorism,"" he said.

At least 50 people were killed and more than 85 others injured in a clash between security forces and gunmen. Sunnis, who comprise a minority of Iraqis, had clout during the Saddam Hussein era but have been politically marginalized since his overthrow. Shiites, who make up a majority of Iraqis, now dominate the government. Since December, tens of thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets of predominately Sunni provinces -- including Anbar, Nineveh, Salaheddin and Diyala -- demanding that the Shiite-led government stop what they call second-class treatment of Iraq's Sunni community.

"Washington (CNN) -- Politics trumped progress on Friday as President Barack Obama and Republican leaders traded blame for $85 billion in forced spending cuts after they failed to come up with a compromise to avert the harshest impacts. The president signed an order required by law that set in motion the automatic, government-wide cuts. Obama and congressional leaders from both parties met for about 45 minutes at the White House, but no agreement emerged to avert the cuts that both sides oppose. After weeks of campaign-style events intended to inspire public outrage over the cuts, Obama sought to temper his description of their impact while making clear he thinks Republican intransigence prevented a deal to avoid the economic harm they'll cause. ""We will get through this,"" he told reporters. ""This is not going to be an apocalypse as some people have said. It's just dumb and it's going to hurt."" Full text of Obama order . Still, a White House budget office report sent to Congress and released with Obama's order said the cuts would be ""deeply destructive to national security, domestic investments, and core government functions."" The action was described in the report as ""a blunt and indiscriminate instrument"" that was ""never intended to be implemented and does not represent a responsible way"" for the country to realize deficit reduction. OMB report to Congress . In a sign of the potential impact, the Department of Justice sent furlough notices to employees that warned they may be forced to take days off without pay in coming months. Similar furloughs, as well as reduced services, were expected at other agencies if the cuts don't get replaced or eliminated. Military leaders have warned of impaired readiness of U.S. forces. Shame and blame: Why Washington needs couples therapy . However, the full impact of the cuts weren't expected until April at the earliest. The cuts amount to roughly 9% for a broad range of non-defense programs and 13% for the Pentagon over the rest of the current fiscal year, which ends on September 30. They were included in a 2011 deal to raise the federal borrowing limit as an unacceptable outcome if Congress failed to agree on a comprehensive deficit reduction plan. Obama's press conference on spending cuts . However, election-year politics stymied progress on such a deal, leading to the situation Friday in which both sides acknowledged being unable to prevent something neither wanted. ""There are smarter ways to cut spending,"" said House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, after the meeting with Obama. Boehner repeated his past assertion that the GOP-led House has offered proposals to replace the forced spending cuts while the Democratic-led Senate has not, as well as his party's opposition to any increased tax revenue to offset the forced spending cuts. Others who also took part in the White House gathering were Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. In the White House briefing room, Obama told reporters that Republicans in Congress ""allowed these cuts to happen because they refuse to budge on closing a single wasteful (tax) loophole to help reduce the deficit."" ""As recently as yesterday, they decided to protect special interest tax breaks for the well off and the well connected and they think that that's apparently more important than protecting our military or middle class families from the pain of these cuts,"" Obama said. He was referring to a procedural vote on Thursday in which Senate Republicans blocked a Democratic proposal that called for eliminating some tax loopholes as part of a package with spending cuts. Boehner and Republicans say the president and Democrats have yet to propose a serious plan to reduce spending, including costly entitlement programs, on a scale necessary to bring chronic federal deficits and debt under control. Both Obama and Boehner foreshadowed the next major spending showdown - a March 27 deadline for Congress to authorize funding to keep the government running for the rest of the fiscal year. 4 myths about the spending cuts . Boehner told reporters that the House will take up a measure next week to authorize federal funding beyond that deadline. ""The president and leaders agreed legislation should be enacted this month to prevent a government shutdown while we continue to work on a solution to replace the"" forced spending cuts, said a statement by Boehner's office. Although the funding measure is unconnected to the spending cuts, Obama indicated he was open to a broader agreement that would resolve both issues. ""I do know that there are Republicans in Congress who privately, at least, say that they would rather close tax loopholes then let these cuts go through,"" said Obama in response to questions from reporters. ""... In the coming days and the coming weeks, I'm going to keeping on reaching out to them -- both individually and as groups of senators or members of the House -- and say to them, 'Let's fix this, not just for a month or two, but for years to come,' because the greatest nation on Earth does not conduct its business in month-to-month increments or by careening from crisis to crisis,"" Obama said.

"New York (CNN) -- The woman accusing former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn of sexually assaulting her insisted she was ""telling the truth from my heart,"" in an interview broadcast Monday. ""I want justice. I want him to go to jail,"" Nafissatou Diallo told ABC.  ""I want him to know you cannot use your power when you do something like this."" The 32-year-old hotel maid, whose credibility has been called into question by prosecutors and Strauss-Kahn's lawyers, said she was terrified when she found out how powerful Strauss-Kahn was. When she saw news reports explaining that the man she was accusing was a leading candidate for the French presidency, ""I said, 'Oh, my God.'  I was crying. I said, 'They're going to kill me, I'm going to die.' ""  That's because in her native Guinea, West Africa, accusing ""a powerful man like that"" would put her life in danger, she said. Diallo's choice to go public with her accusations in the middle of a pending criminal investigation is extremely unusual.  She spoke with both ABC and Newsweek magazine. CNN previously has not identified Diallo, given the network's policy against naming alleged sexual assault victims. But it is now naming her, in light of her decision to make her case to the media. On May 14, Diallo accused Strauss-Kahn, 62, of assaulting and trying to rape her at Manhattan's Sofitel Hotel, where she was an employee. He was charged in New York with sexual abuse and attempted rape, pleading not guilty on all counts. He insists the encounter with Diallo was consensual. Strauss-Kahn's attorneys William Taylor and Benjamin Brafman issued a revised statement Monday standing by their earlier claim that Diallo is ""the first accuser in history to conduct a media campaign to persuade a prosecutor to pursue charges against an innocent person from whom she wants money."" ""These efforts are a desperate distraction from the key fact that Ms. Diallo has had to admit to misleading these very same prosecutors from the beginning. And, her lawyers know that her claim for money suffers a fatal blow when the criminal charges are dismissed as they must be,"" the statement said. Accompanied by her lawyers, Diallo plans to meet on Wednesday with prosecutors in Manhattan, a source close to the investigation tells CNN. This would be the first such meeting in nearly a month. Relations between the two parties have been strained since Diallo's attorney Kenneth Thompson held a news conference in which he graphically detailed the alleged attack and then accused prosecutors of abandoning his client. In addition to the state case, Thompson said Monday that he plans to file a lawsuit this week against Strauss-Kahn on behalf of Diallo. Strauss-Kahn's lawyers said, referring to Diallo and her attorney's actions, said, ""The number of rallies, press conferences and media events they have orchestrated is exceeded only by the number of lies and misstatements she has made to law enforcement, friends, medical professionals and reporters ... It is time for this unseemly circus to stop."" Thompson shot back, accusing Strauss-Kahn's attorneys of conducting ""an unprecedented smear campaign against the victim of a violent sexual attack."" ""Because of those contemptible, baseless and anonymous attacks, Ms. Diallo was forced to come forward in order to put a face to the brutal crime,"" Thompson said in a statement. On July 1, a judge freed Strauss-Kahn from house arrest after prosecutors presented evidence showing that Diallo admitted she had lied about the specifics of her whereabouts after the incident and, from her past, the details of an asylum application and information she put on tax forms. Prosecutors said she admitted lying on the asylum application about having been a victim of a gang rape, even providing details of that attack. She cried when she first told prosecutors about the alleged gang rape, but in a subsequent interview, she admitted it never occurred. She said the fabricated account on the asylum application was made with the assistance of a man who ""provided her with a cassette recording of the facts"" so that she could memorize them. ABC reported that in the interview, Diallo acknowledged ""mistakes."" But she insisted that her story of what happened in the hotel is the unvarnished truth. ""He came to me and grabbed my breasts,"" she told ABC, adding that she asked him to stop and said ""I don't want to lose my job."" ""I was like, 'Stop this, stop this,' "" she said in the interview.  But, she insisted, Strauss-Kahn ""kept pushing me back to the hallway. ... I was so afraid. I was so scared."" In the interview with Newsweek, conducted at her lawyer's office in New York City, Diallo said Strauss-Kahn was naked when he slammed the door shut to his luxury hotel room, forced himself upon her and tried to make her perform oral sex on him. She said she was ""nervous"" and ""scared"" when she eventually ran from Strauss-Kahn's hotel room, ending an incident that took about 15 minutes. Strauss-Kahn was initially arrested at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport while on board a Paris-bound plane. His arrest created an international furor, prompting his resignation as IMF chief as New York Judge Michael Obus ordered him held under a $6 million bail. Political watchers in France said he would no longer be a likely candidate for the upcoming presidential election. While prosecutors have questioned Diallo's credibility, the charges against Strauss-Kahn have not been dismissed. There have been further twists in recent weeks, including writer Tristane Banon's filing of a complaint accusing Strauss-Kahn of attempted rape in France, stemming from an alleged 2003 incident in Paris. A lawyer for Strauss-Kahn in France said he subsequently filed a counterclaim against Banon for false declarations. Diallo filed a libel lawsuit against the New York Post and five of its reporters after the newspaper reported that the woman accusing Strauss-Kahn was a prostitute. The paper cited anonymous sources and said it stands by its reporting. ""Because of him, they call me a prostitute,"" Diallo said in the Newsweek interview, blaming Strauss-Kahn for the accusations. Strauss-Kahn's next court date for the New York incident is scheduled for August 1. The hearing had been pushed back from mid-July as prosecutors tried to determine whether to drop the charges or move forward in the case, said Erin Duggan, communications director for Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance. On Sunday, amid the fresh attention related to Diallo's interviews, Duggan declined to comment on what she called the ""pending criminal case."" ""To protect the integrity of the criminal justice system, the rights of the victim and the rights of the accused, we will not discuss the facts or evidence in what remains an ongoing investigation,"" she said in a statement. CNN's Susan Candiotti and Adam Reiss contributed to this report.","NEW: Nafissatou Diallo will meet with prosectuors Wednesday, a source says .

"Washington (CNN) -- Two seconds. Take your eyes off the road any longer and your chances of crashing multiply. With that in mind, the federal government on Tuesday asked automakers to equip cars with devices that require only fleeting glances to operate, instead of prolonged stares. Under the new voluntary guidelines, drivers should be able to operate on-board electronics while removing their eyes from the road -- or a hand from the wheel -- no longer than two seconds at a time, or 12 seconds total. Time-consuming functions -- such as text messaging and Internet browsing -- should be allowed only when a car is stopped and in park, the Department of Transportation said. Drivers should not be allowed to text or browse even at slow speeds because of the danger it presents to pedestrians, the DOT said. The guidelines, said Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, ""balance the innovation consumers want with the safety we all need."" Some 3,000 people were killed and 387,000 injured in 2011 in accidents involving distracted drivers, he said. The new guidelines, which came after months of review, give automakers guidance about a wide range of electronic equipment installed in new automobiles, but considered ""secondary"" to the job of driving. They include communications devices, such as hands-free phones, navigation equipment, such as GPS units, entertainment devices, such as DVD movie players, and information gathering devices, such as internet-enabled devices. The technology advances are crucial selling points, especially for passenger cars, sport utilities, pickups and vans made by U.S. automakers. LaHood had met previously with car executives to express his overall concerns about distracted driving and to discuss ways to reduce it. The guidelines do not apply to hand-held cell phones, the use of which the DOT has long discouraged. A separate guideline is being developed for those phones and all other after-market and portable devices. LaHood and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration chief David Strickland said a new NHTSA study showed that ""visual-manual tasks"" associated with hand-held phones and other portable devices increase the risk of getting into a crash by three times. Researches used video-cameras to study 204 drivers for an average 31 days. The study showed that drivers talked on a cell phone 10.6 percent of the time the vehicle was in operation. The new guidelines seek to separate devices which assist in driving from those which might distract from it. They explicitly allow static or moving maps found on GPS navigation devices, with information that assists the driver. But it recommends against imagery such as photorealistic, satellite or three-dimensional images. The guidelines recommend that devices be designed so that tasks can be completed by the driver with glances away from the roadway of two seconds or less and a cumulative period of 12 seconds or less, in a series of 1.5 second glances. The DOT is recommending the auto industry adopt the changes in the next three years for all cars, trucks and buses weighing up to 10,000 pounds. It has exempted police, fire, the military and other emergency vehicles. It says the guidelines are voluntary -- instead of mandatory -- because of the ""need for additional research on distraction and its effects on driving"" and because of the rapid changes in technology.","U.S. asks automakers to equip cars with electronics that require only a glance to operate .

"(CNN) -- The media verdict is in: Barack Obama is cursed. Less than four months after taking the oath of office for the second time, he is seen as falling prey to some mysterious witchcraft that casts a fatal spell on re-elected presidents. ""Will Obama suffer the 'second-term curse'?"" asks the Washington Post. ""President Obama stares down the second-term curse,"" says Politico. And such stories ricocheted onto NBC's ""Today"" show, on which, we learned, ""some observers"" are questioning whether ""Mr. Obama is falling victim to the second-term curse."" One can almost conjure up a bubbling cauldron of black smoke with a wand-wielding wizard laughing diabolically. Now, there's no question that second-term presidents often stumble or run out of gas. But the punditry suggests a one-size-fits-all scenario that isn't borne out by history. What's more, there's a rush-to-judgment air to some of these pronouncements that implies his second term is on the verge of failure, with more than 3 1/2 years to go. It isn't hard to build the case that the president finds himself in a ditch. The almost offhanded disclosure that the IRS was targeting conservative and tea party groups for reviews of their tax-exempt status, and the revelation that a top agency official knew about this two years ago, is an outrage that carries disturbing echoes of Richard Nixon. (Now there's a guy whose second term didn't turn out too well.) The Benghazi debacle (which of course happened in Obama's first term) finally gained traction after ABC News reported that the administration's misleading talking points after the fatal attack had been scrubbed to remove references to a group affiliated with al-Qaeda and CIA warnings about terrorism. Republicans, meanwhile, have been making Obama's life miserable, defeating a modest measure on background checks for guns, slow-walking immigration legislation and refusing to vote for some Cabinet nominees. Oh, and the economy isn't doing that well either. But does that amount to a jinxed second term, or the same kind of partisan standoff that has marked Obama's years in office? A look back at recent second-termers makes clear that every set of problems is inherently different. George W. Bush vowed to spend his political capital after winning in 2004, but a move to privatize Social Security quickly collapsed. The sluggish federal response to Hurricane Katrina sealed an image of the administration as incompetent, against the backdrop of a bloody Iraq war. And he left office amid the financial crisis of 2008. Bill Clinton's second term blew up when the Monica Lewinsky scandal erupted and he got himself impeached. But less remembered is the pre-scandal year of 1997, when the president and Newt Gingrich's Republicans hammered out an agreement to balance the budget for the first time in three decades. It was sex and lies that proved Clinton's undoing, although his popularity remained high when he left office. In similar fashion, Ronald Reagan's second term ran aground when the Iran-Contra scandal exploded in late 1986. What has been overshadowed is the sweeping legislation on tax reform and overhauling immigration that he passed earlier in the year. And Reagan's personal approval rating was sufficiently intact that he was able to hand over the office to his vice president. As for Obama, smart journalists are careful not to be definitive when writing their trend pieces. Politico says the recent setbacks ""have left the president feeling deeply frustrated, even angry â€” and eager to find a way to recapture the offensive."" The Washington Post piece describes his mounting woes as ""diversions working against a president who is keenly aware of how little time he has left to achieve big things."" This brings us to the thing that every second-term president since FDR has indeed faced: a ticking clock. A re-elected commander-in-chief is a lame duck whose ability to reward and punish inevitably diminishes as his departure date approaches. And that, rather than any sinister voodoo, may be Obama's biggest problem as he tries to dig his way out of this ditch. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Howard Kurtz.","Howard Kurtz: Media saying Obama is running into the ""second-term curse""
He says it's true Obama's running into trouble, but pundits' rush to judgment premature .

"(CNN) -- The head of world football's global governing body has criticized Italian soccer for not cracking down hard enough on a team whose fans racially abused an opposition player. Sunday's goalless draw between AC Milan and Roma at the San Siro stadium was brought to a halt for several minutes after visiting fans directed abuse at home striker Mario Balotelli. The Italian Federation fined Roma $65,000, which prompted a forthright response from Blatter. ""What is surprising and is not understandable for me, is that the disciplinary committee of the Italian Football Federation has taken a decision, not even 24 hours after the event, by just imposing a fine,"" Blatter told FIFA's official website. ""They have not made any investigation of what happened. And just to give a pecuniary sanction is not valid, that is not acceptable. ""You will always find money. What is $65,000 for such an incident? I'm not happy and I will call the Italian Federation. That's not a way to deal with such matters."" In response, the Italian Federation said it was acting within existing regulations but hopes that an agenda tabled at UEFA's Executive Committee meeting in London later this month will enable it to take tougher measures. On May 24, members of the European governing will vote on a proposal to introduce a minimum 10-match sanction for any discriminatory offenses -- a ruling which could apply to all UEFA competitions from as early as July if passed. ""The UEFA Congress will determine new deterrents that will go from imposing a fine to the total closure of a venue,"" said Italian Federation president Giancarlo Abete. ""These new rules will be received by our Code of Sport Justice once approved from (the start of) the 2013/2014 season."" Speaking to Italian media on Monday, Abete's views on the ineffectiveness of financial sanctions tallied with those of Blatter. ""Fines are not penalizing,"" he said. He added that his body wishes to close parts of a stadium where ""episodes of racism take place"" before taking the more drastic measure of playing matches without fans should incidents persist. The club at the center of the row has also stated its desire to eradicate an issue that Abete says is damaging the image of Italian football. ""Roma condemns any form of racial abuse,"" the Serie A club said on Monday. ""This type of behavior from any football supporters, including ours, is completely unacceptable. ""We are committed to facing this issue head-on to rid our sport of this problem and promote respect for all."" The newly-created FIFA anti-racism task force met for the first time earlier this month and proposed placing officials at matches in order to ""identify potential acts of discrimination"", a suggestion that will be voted on by FIFA's members later this month. ""It is incredible, that we had such incidents especially in the Italian Serie A in the San Siro between AC Milan and Roma, a very important match,"" continued Blatter, who has been head of world football's governing body since 1998. ""The referee had to stop the match for a few minutes in order to bring back calm. This is bad, because we are just holding this task force against racism."" Roma's sanction is not the first suffered by an Italian club this season. Last month, Inter Milan were fined nearly $60,000 by European governing body UEFA after its fans were found guilty of ""improper conduct"" in chants directed towards Tottenham Hotspur striker Emmanuel Adebayor. In February, Lazio received its fourth charge of racist behavior this season -- with Roma's city rivals having been fined nearly $300,000 after repeated fan transgressions. On Monday, Milan chief executive officer Adriano Galliani was quoted by Italian newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport as saying: ""Just as violence at football grounds was eliminated, racist chanting can also be stopped if there is the necessary will."" The task force was created after a series of incidents of racist abuse which have blighted the sport in recent years. Balotelli's Milan teammate Kevin-Prince Boateng, a member of the task force, walked off following racist chanting during an exhibition match against lower division team Pro Patria in January. The English Premier League has also had to deal with racism cases. Chelsea's John Terry and Liverpool's Luis Suarez were fined and received lengthy bans for two separate offenses which occurred in 2011. The English Football Association (FA) is due to vote this week on the introduction of a minimum five-game ban for any incident of racist abuse, which is half the proposed tally outlined by UEFA. ""We don't have to follow UEFA,"" FA chairman David Bernstein was reported to have said by British newspaper The Guardian. ""Ours is a very detailed and thought-out proposal. It is not likely to be exactly in line with UEFA's. ""Ours will have a minimum but it will have a clear acceleration from that minimum. We may well yet go beyond the 10.""","Fifa chief Sepp Blatter criticizes Italian soccer for ""unacceptable"" racism punishment .

"(CNN) -- When I was at Cambridge University 10 years ago, there was a story of a history professor who began his lecture series with this piece of advice: ""We all know that Margaret Thatcher was evil, but don't write that in the exam."" The sweep of his judgment -- including the presumption that his students all thought the same -- articulates the way that Margaret Thatcher's legacy divides Britain. The things she did may have been necessary, but the way that she did them cleaved the country in two. Thatcher was a paradoxical figure: a radical conservative. Conservatives traditionally want to uphold the social order that they inherit, but she wanted to upend the postwar British consensus and return the country to what she regarded as its older glory. When she became prime minister in 1979, she inherited a country in which public services were nationalized, unions were all-powerful and British power was in retreat overseas. Her time in office proved revolutionary: The top rate of tax fell from 83% to 40%, major industries and services were privatized, the unions were reformed and their influence diminished and the UK successfully liberated the Falkland Islands from Argentinian occupation. Britain owes its present wealth and global reputation to Thatcher, a woman who saw accepting decline as an immoral affront to patriotism. Opinion: How 'Lady T' built transatlantic bridges . There were many winners. People such as my parents were permitted to buy the house that they rented from the local government and so gained a stake in the property market. Share ownership blossomed and the size of the banking industry broke 100% of the GDP for the first time. Average earnings increased 181%. Aspiration became fashionable in a land where people had always been taught that they were defined by the class in which they were born. I'm very much one of ""Thatcher's children"" -- education and hard work have given me opportunities that were, for my parents, the stuff of dreams. But there were also losers. Thatcher insisted that her policies were about uniting the country by giving the working class an investment in capitalism. But she also demonized her opponents and spoke of the organized left as an ""enemy within."" Class conflict worsened as some felt that the government was prioritizing the needs of the southern middle class over the northern working class. There were riots in major cities, particularly among ethnic minorities, and the coal miners took Britain into a yearlong strike that sometimes felt like a civil war. Opinion: Why Thatcher was the 'Iron Lady' The conflict was motored as much by Thatcher's personality as her policies. I suspect that any government running Britain in the 1980s would have been forced to accept some degree of economic liberalization. Left-wing governments in New Zealand and Australia also experimented with deregulation -- because the economic circumstances of the time demanded it, regardless of the political character of the government. What made Thatcherism unique was its hard-headedness. There were episodes of compromise. Thatcher caved into one threat of a coal strike before refusing to cooperate with the second, and she held back from overhauling the welfare state, pouring money into the National Health Service. But the tone of her administration was aggressive. When confronted by moderates within her own party, she famously said, ""U-turn if you want to. The lady's not for turning."" Such rhetorical ferocity was common. Thatcher on consensus politics: ""To me, consensus seems to be the process of abandoning all beliefs, principles, values and policies. So it is something in which no one believes and to which no one objects."" On society: ""There is no such thing as society. There are individual men and women, and there are families."" Often Thatcher is compared to President Ronald Reagan, and there are philosophical similarities. But a key difference is that Reagan rhetorically always tried to find common ground between Americans and could be loved even by those who disagreed with him. Thatcher -- perhaps because of the scale of the challenges she faced -- almost always divided. Today, you can instantly tell the politics of a Brit by the face they pull when you mention her name. Opinion: Why Britain needs another Thatcher . However controversial her legacy it might be, her importance remains beyond dispute. Thatcher destroyed socialism in Britain, turned outdated public services into effective enterprises, broke the dead grip of militant unionism on everyday life and restored confidence to Britain on the global stage. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and the very Labour Party opposition that fought her so bitterly in the 1980s stole most of her policies in the 1990s -- and won themselves three elections as a result. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair of the Labour Party said on hearing the news of Thatcher's death, ""I always thought my job was to build on some of the things she had done rather than reverse them."" And for a younger generation without clearer memories of the past, she can be admired as a woman from a humble background who broke through the ceiling of gender prejudice to transform her country. In an age when we seem to be led in the UK by gray men from privileged backgrounds with a habit of chasing poll numbers rather than dreams, her ambition and zeal are truly missed. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Timothy Stanley.","Timothy Stanley says Margaret Thatcher was a paradox as a radical conservative .

"(CNN) -- His voice wavering, Mark Mattioli wiped away tears as he recalled the day his 6-year-old son died when a man wielding an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle broke into Sandy Hook Elementary School and began shooting. His son, James, was among the 20 children and seven adults killed by Adam Lanza on December 14 in Newtown, Connecticut -- an event so horrific that it has since spawned a federal task force and kick-started a national conversation about gun control. But unlike the handful of other parents who testified Monday at the emotionally charged hearing in Hartford, Connecticut, Mattioli said there are more than enough gun laws on the books. He called instead for a closer look at mental health policies. Why new laws could miss America's bigger gun problem . ""I don't care if you named it 'James' law,' I don't want (another law),"" he said during the first of a series of meetings set up by a legislative task force assigned to review the state's gun laws. ""I think there's much more promise for a solution in identifying, researching and creating solutions along the lines of mental health."" Connecticut's medical examiner said he was told that Lanza, 20, had Asperger's syndrome. Research has not shown a link between that condition and violence. The hearing drew hundreds to the Connecticut state house and revealed the sharp divide in public opinion over what should happen next in the massacre's aftermath. ""The time is now,"" said Veronique Pozner, whose son, Noah, was also killed, referring to a strengthening of the nation's gun laws. Sandy Hook probe to extend until summer . With a framed photo of her slain 6-year-old propped up beside her, Pozner called on Connecticut to become ""an agent for change"" across the country. During her testimony, she held up a crayon drawing that Noah once scrawled on Thanksgiving. ""I am thankful for the life I live,"" he wrote. At one point during the hearing, Neil Heslin, father of a 6-year-old boy named Jesse who was also gunned down that day, asked why the public needed assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Some people in the crowd then interrupted his statement and shouted the ""Second Amendment shall not be infringed."" ""We're not living in the Wild West. We're not a Third World nation,"" Heslin continued. ""We have the strongest military in the world. We don't need to defend our homes with weapons like that."" Connecticut already has some of the nation's strictest gun laws. Gov. Dannel Malloy, a first-term Democrat, has also vowed to address the factors that led to last month's massacre and set up a 16-member panel of experts to come up with recommendations. It includes experts who reviewed policies after mass shootings in Colorado and at Virginia Tech.

"(CNN) -- In July 2011, my husband and I traveled to a Russian orphanage to meet a 2-year-old girl. We petitioned the Russian courts to adopt her, and waited 14 agonizing months to be granted a court date, all along fearing we would never be able to bring her home. Now, 46 families are stuck in that nightmare of waiting for an indefinite amount of time. Russia has banned Americans from adopting Russian orphans. These families, like ours, left their Russian children holding small albums with photos of their soon-to-be families. And now those children have nothing more than a broken promise. Russia's adoption ban was passed in retaliation for the United States' passage of the Magnitsky Act, a human rights bill targeting Russian officials. But while it is designed to hit Americans in the heart, it also condemns thousands of Russian orphans who could have found families in America. Orphanages, even the good ones, are institutions. They are no substitutes for parents. Children who grow up in institutions experience poor physical, cognitive and emotional health and are more likely to end up in poverty, experience drug abuse, or commit suicide. Orphaned children have suffered already; the adoption ban ensures they will suffer more. Institutionalized children need families, not staff. When children become wards of the state, they need the government to find adoptive families, in their home country or failing that, internationally. Many Americans want to bring Russian orphans into their families, but years of political maneuvering have made it harder and harder. Legal changes have also contributed to a steady decline in the number of Russian orphans adopted by Americans. We experienced many of the changes during our adoption process. Not all of them are bad. Many of the procedures are clearly intended to protect the children. However, some of the changes made it more challenging for families willing to jump through the hoops of two governments. There's more uncertainty involved, and the length of time to complete an adoption has increased, as well as the costs. Our daughter, Anastasia, spent a needless year waiting to come home. When other adopted children were picked up by their families, she would take out her photo of the three of us and ask her caregivers where her mama and papa were. Less than a decade ago, 4,000 to 5,000 Russian children found adoptive families in America each year. In 2011, the number dropped to 970. The steep decline in international adoptions from Russia, along with the recent ban, is a step in the wrong direction. It is easy to understand why international adoption is a hot-button issue for many countries. It can feel shameful for a government to require international charity to solve its own problems. But even countries like the U.S. allow for intercountry adoption. Ultimately, the goal should be to find adoptive families for orphans, and sometimes those families cannot be found in the child's home country. Mother to mother: An adoptive mom's plea to first lady Michelle Obama . My husband and I returned to Russia for a third time in October 2012 to bring Anastasia -- then 3 Â½ years old -- home. Our daughter was well cared for by the good people in her orphanage for 912 days. But the lack of love and care that can be provided by a nurturing family impacted her emotionally and physically. During our first week as a family, Anastasia gave us the most confused looks when we tried to hold her, tickle her, or otherwise play with her. Two months later, though she still struggled to make sense of her story, she sought us out for snuggles and gradually started to like being chased, tickled, hugged and loved. Anastasia's 912 days of delayed growth are disappearing. But children who remain in orphanages never overcome these delays. Children living in orphan institutions need world leaders who do not use them as political pawns, but rather work to protect them. Russia's adoption ban must be lifted. It punishes thousands of children whose only chance of finding an adoptive family is through international adoption. Russia should start by making good on its promise to the 46 families who are left in limbo. These children are waiting to go home, waiting for what every child deserves -- a loving family.

"(CNN) -- Thank you, Jason Collins, for stepping up and being a real man. I like your game. A real man is honest and confident and can look the world in the eye and take responsibility for his own life. Real men can stand up to religious zealots who believe that they have the right to stand in judgment of others. You are exactly the right man at the right time to help break down the stereotypes about gays in professional sports. And kudos to the NBA Commissioner David Stern for working tirelessly over decades to create a workplace environment that is inclusive and diverse across many cultural issues, including sexual orientation. ""Jason has been a widely respected player and teammate throughout his career, and we are proud he has assumed the leadership mantle on this very important issue,"" the commissioner said Monday. Having worked in sports for two decades and having been a straight ally for most of my adult life, I know this day didn't come just because President Barack Obama and other politicians say it's OK to be gay. Sure, having the topic of LGBT equality in the public conversation is an important part of changing a culture, but it has been the everyday people with the courage to advocate for equality and break down hostile environments that make a day like Monday possible. The NBA, more than any other professional men's sports league, has worked to create a culture that supports gay athletes. No doubt, there will be critics and ugly accusations thrown at Collins. And that, along with his anemic stats -- 1.1 points per game -- might make it a challenge for him to find a job in the NBA next season. But the reaction from his peers to his coming out has been overwhelmingly positive: . NBA star Al Horford, an ex-teammate of Collins, tweeted: Al Horfordâ€ .","Roxanne Jones: Kudos to NBA player Jason Collins for coming out publicly .
Jones: NBA head David Stern worked for decades to create an inclusive environment .

Only question that matters for Collins, she says, is whether he can step up his game ."
"Washington (CNN) -- Federal authorities indicted and arrested more than 100 doctors, nurses and health care executives nationwide Thursday in what officials said was the biggest crackdown ever in a single day in connection with Medicare fraud. ""We are pleased to announce the largest federal health care fraud takedown in our nation's history,"" proclaimed Attorney General Eric Holder. Holder said that at the time of the midday news conference in Washington, the number of arrests stood at 111 and was expected to increase later in the day. The false billings to defraud Medicare totaled $225 million, Holder said. The arrests occurred in nine cities. Thirty-two defendants including two doctors and eight nurses were charged in Miami with various fraud schemes. Another 21 defendants were charged in Detroit, along with 11 in Chicago; 10 in Brooklyn, New York; 10 in Tampa, Florida; nine in Houston; seven in Dallas; six in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and five in Los Angeles. ""Doctors, nurses, and medical professionals from Los Angeles to New York and cities in between have cheated taxpayers and patients alike by defrauding the Medicare program,"" declared Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer. ""Medical professionals charge for phantom procedures and unnecessary equipment. Kickbacks dictate treatment. Fraud drives prescriptions. Criminals profit, and taxpayers foot the bill,"" Breuer said. Officials from the Justice Department and the Department of Health and Human Services said the cost of enforcing health care fraud laws is proving to be a good financial investment. Last year, federal agencies recovered a record $4 billion from fraudsters. ""From 2008 to 2010, every dollar the federal government spent under its health care fraud and abuse control programs averaged a return on investment (of) $6.80,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said. With the growing pot of federal money for Medicare expected to increase by more than $6 trillion in the next decade, officials said they recognize the potential allure of Medicare to potential fraudsters and to organized crime groups. FBI Executive Assistant Director Shawn Henry said all citizens will feel the pinch of health care fraud. ""You will absolutely feel the financial impact,"" Henry said. ""Like a pickpocket, you'll just feel the pinch in a different way: higher health care costs, higher insurance premiums and more expensive prescription drugs.""","In Miami, 32 people -- including two doctors and eight nurses -- were charged .

"(CNN) -- An evangelical preacher killed his wife several years ago and stuffed her body in a freezer after she caught him abusing their daughter, according to police and court documents. Anthony Hopkins appeared in court Thursday to face murder, rape and incest charges. Anthony Hopkins, 37, was arrested Monday night at the Inspirational Tabernacle Church of God in Christ in Jackson, Alabama, just after he had delivered a sermon to a congregation that included his seven other children, officials said. He faces charges including murder, rape, sodomy, sexual abuse and incest. Hopkins was denied bail Thursday when he appeared before Mobile County District Judge George Hardesty. The case is set for arraignment next week, Hardesty's clerk said. The case began Monday, when the daughter, now 19, went to the Mobile Police Department's Child Advocacy Center and reported that she had been sexually abused by Hopkins since she was 11 years old, according to an affidavit filed in support of a search warrant of the preacher's home in Mobile. The affidavit related the daughter's story as follows: . Her mother, Arletha Hopkins, 36, caught her father abusing her in a bathroom in November 2004. Afterward, her parents argued, and her mother locked her father out of the house. The father came to the daughter's window and asked her to let him in, and she did so. The next morning, her father asked her to help him hide her mother's body in the freezer in the laundry room of the home. The girl said she moved out of the home about two weeks ago and was living with a neighbor. She told police that her mother's body was still in the freezer. When authorities went to the home, no one was there, as Hopkins and the other children were at the church. A body was found in the freezer, the affidavit says. Although police think the body is that of Arletha Hopkins, an identification is not expected until early next week, Mobile Police spokesman Officer Eric Gallichant said Thursday.  Watch Nancy Grace's report » . Mobile Police Chief Phillip Garrett had said that an identification and autopsy results would take a few days: ""obviously, the body was in a freezer."" He said he was not sure of the body's condition or whether it was intact, as upon seeing the body, authorities immediately sealed the chest-type freezer. The body had been covered in the unit, he said, and the entire appliance was taken to the state Department of Forensic Science. At the Inspirational Tabernacle Church of God in Christ, Hopkins was preaching at a revival, pastor Beverly Jackson told CNN affiliate WKRG. His message, she said, was about forgiveness and not passing judgment -- and at one point, he turned to his seven children and asked them to forgive him his past, present and future. Police allowed Hopkins to finish his sermon before arresting him, Jackson said. She said she asked police why they were arresting him and was told, ""he murdered his wife."" She said Hopkins had told her his wife died four years ago while giving birth to their youngest son. Attempts to reach Jackson on Thursday were unsuccessful. Authorities moved quickly on the daughter's accusations to make sure the children still in the household were OK, Garrett said. They were placed in the custody of child welfare authorities. The next-oldest child is a 17-year-old female, he said. All eight were the children of Arletha Hopkins, and Anthony Hopkins fathered six of them, he said. An investigation has not found any record of Arletha Hopkins' existence since 2004, according to the affidavit. Asked how long police think the body had been in the freezer, Garrett said, ""I'm thinking that she's probably been there for a number of years."" He said Anthony Hopkins did not have a regular church but apparently preached in various areas around the South. ""Part of the mystery here is that, apparently, none of these children were in school"" but were being home-schooled, Mobile County District Attorney John Tyson said. ""Home schooling, under this situation, removes almost any chances of us catching up with these kinds of things until there is a catastrophe."" Pastor Jerry Porter said he used to preach with Hopkins at his church, the Williams Street Holiness Church, and knew the family. Arletha Hopkins ""was very quiet,"" he told Mobile television station and CNN affiliate WPMI. ""She was kind of secluded. She'd talk, but not much."" Anthony Hopkins, he said, made statements that led him to believe all was not well at home. ""He always used to tell me ... 'You're blessed in the fact that you have a wife that supports you and what you're trying to do for God,' "" Porter said. He said Arletha Hopkins disappeared shortly after the couple's youngest child was born. As rumors swirled, Porter said, he confronted Hopkins and asked whether his wife was dead. Hopkins ""wouldn't give me an answer,"" he said. After that, Porter said, he banned him from the church but remained on good terms with him. He said he visited the family a few years ago, and their home was clean and well-kept. ""It was the ideal family. I mean, the children were so respectful, just so easygoing,"" Porter said. ""Didn't seem to be no stress at all. Never got that impression, never."" The children, he said, ""loved their dad. They were very close to him."" Of Hopkins' preaching ability, Porter said, ""he was a bulls-eye prophet. If he told you something, you could pretty much bank on it.""","NEW: Anthony Hopkins denied bail at initial court appearance .

"(CNN) -- All roads for the modern gentleman led to Italy this month, home of international fashion tradeshow Pitti Immagine Uomo, the nexus of the menswear universe. More than 50,000 international retailers, designers, buyers and fans congregated in Florence for the weeklong fair to discover what will be next in the world of men's fashion. Florence has hosted Pitti since its inception in 1972, but don't expect to find only Italians roaming the pavilions. This January, nearly 8,000 out of 20,450 buyers were from outside of Italy, a 5% increase from last year, according to official figures. The foreign influence has gone beyond bottom lines and ticket lines. The British gentleman was a style mainstay this year, showing up in vendor booths and in the piazzas, clad in shades of tweed, sporting elbow patches and shoes with monkstraps. With the success of the TV show ""Downton Abbey,"" a jubilee and a royal baby on the way, the UK has edged its way into the global consciousness, fashion insiders say. Specialized markets create new look . ""It's a generational thing. If you wait long enough, these feel like new clothes to a new generation. Michael Bastian, Band of Outsiders [are] all interpreting classic design but in a younger, hipper incarnation. You could wear this on the weekend and not look too traditional or old-fashioned,"" said Jim Moore, creative director of menswear publication GQ. ""Menswear had its inception in Great Britain,"" he said.""It's the land of tradition and tweeds, simple fabric, seasonally appropriate fabrics."" Others suggest there may be even more intuitive reasons for the current popularity of British menswear, especially in an uncertain global economy. ""The essence of British style is in its timelessness,"" said Sue Newton, spokeswoman for quintessential British heritage brand Barbour. ""It is reassuring in turbulent economic times to turn to something familiar."" That familiarity has driven a ""flight to quality"" with consumers opting for the value that comes in owning garments that will last from season to season, she said. High fashion, minus the labels . Barbour was one of 600 UK-based buyers who showed at Pitti this season, which overlapped with the biannual menswear shows in London. Barbour, which has been making garments since 1894, showed at Pitti instead of London. Menswear, in recent decades hiding in the shadow of a booming women's fashion industry, has seemingly come of age. What had previously been a woman's world is vastly becoming a playground for men as well. ""Back 10, 12, 15 years ago, menswear used to be not so open, as it has become in the last few years. In the past in Italy, it was necessary to have a uniform,"" said Raffaello Napoleone, CEO of Pitti Immagine Uomo. ""Now it's much more open and more amusing, in the best way. You can be what you want."" The results of this newfound ""peacocking"" have been resounding. Men's items now account for half of the global luxury apparel market, according to the British Fashion Council. In a time when most European economies have been stagnant or shrinking, the menswear industry has been booming. In 2011, global menswear sales increased by 9%, taking in more than $33 billion worldwide. ""It's finally not the dirty little secret anymore, men really do care. Guys are thirsting for it. Not only on the runway but on the street,"" Moore said. ""This whole British thing has brought out each guy's sense of inner peacock. They want to look great."" Men go online to cultivate style .","Biannual menswear trade show Pitti Immagine Uomo draws 50,000 to Florence, Italy .

"(CNN) -- Armed, masked men raise their weapons and shoot dead three men sitting on a curb in a Syrian city. The images are captured on video, purportedly showing Islamist rebels carrying out a public execution of soldiers. The incident occurred in Raqqa city, in the north. Videos produced by locals sympathetic to the Islamists have appeared on the Web, and an opposition group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights issued a report on the incident Tuesday. ""Rebel fighters from the Islamic State of Iraq and Bilad al-Sham (Syria) have summarily executed three men in the middle of a square in Raqqa city,"" the Observatory said. ""The jihadis stated that the detainees were officers from the Syrian army."" The videos show armed masked men standing in a street, with one of them reading from a paper. A crowd of onlookers can be seen in the background. Gunmen shoot dead three men who are sitting on a curb and the militants raise their weapons in celebration. There was no immediate comment on the incident from rebel leaders and the government. This is the latest report of an atrocity in a war rife with abuse, killing and widespread population displacement. Since the unrest began in March 2011, Syrians have described a range of human rights abuses by security forces and backers of President Bashar al-Assad's regime. There have been claims of atrocities by rebel forces as well. The Raqqa incident comes on the heels of a horrific video showing a man said to be a Syrian rebel carving into the body of a government soldier, cutting out his heart and liver, and putting the heart in his mouth, taking a bite. Other violence persisted Wednesday. Clashes broke out between rebel fighters and regime troops at the Aleppo central prison, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The Israeli military said several Syrian rockets landed in the Mount Hermon area of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, on the border with Syria. At least 50 people were killed Wednesday across the country, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. Of those, 18 were in Aleppo and four were in Raqqa. Meanwhile, the Internet is back up in Syria after being down for more than eight hours Wednesday, according to the Renesys Corp., an Internet monitoring company. A week ago, a widespread Internet outage in Syria lasted more than 19 hours before access was restored. Diplomatic moves . On Wednesday, the U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution calling for a political transition in Syria. The resolution, which passed by a 107-12 vote, with 59 abstentions, also condemned the government's increased use of heavy weapons and ongoing ""widespread and systematic gross violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms,"" said a U.N. statement. It was the fifth resolution on Syria voted by the body since 2011. ""If we are unable to do anything to stop this tragedy, then how can we sustain the moral credibility of this organization?"" Assembly President Vuk Jeremic said before the vote, according to the statement. Meanwhile, in Sweden, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov discussed the revival of a peace initiative based on last year's Geneva conference. That conference, brokered by Russia and the United States, outlined how a transitional government could be formed in Syria. ""I think it's fair to say that both of us are confident about the direction that we're moving in and very, very hopeful that within a short period of time, the pieces will have come together fully so that the world, hopefully, will have an opportunity to be given an alternative to the violence and destruction that is taking place in Syria at this moment,"" Kerry said. Lavrov cited the Russian-American proposal to convene a conference to start implementing the Geneva communique last June. ""It's self-explanatory, and what we need now is to mobilize support for this initiative on the basis of what was, I believe, in Geneva and what was proposed by Washington and Moscow: to mobilize support, first of all, by all the Syrian groups, the regime and all opposition groups; and second by those outside actors who have influence on either one or the other Syrian group,"" Lavrov said.

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- Christine O'Donnell shocked the political establishment last week with her victory in the Republican Senate primary in Delaware against Rep. Mike Castle. Like most Tea Party activists, O'Donnell has embraced the anti-Washington rhetoric that has been popular among congressional candidates in the current political climate. She and other conservatives have criticized fellow Republicans, like Castle, for having become too comfortable in the nation's capital, too willing to work through the normal political process and to compromise on core principles. ""The people of Delaware have spoken. No more politics as usual,"" she said upon declaring victory. This kind of anti-Washington rhetoric usually works well on the campaign trail, but it tends to vanish once a candidate is elected and starts the new job. Ever since Vietnam and Watergate shook public confidence in our government institutions, many Democrats and Republicans have defined themselves in opposition to the very job that they hope to win. In most of these cases, they have then abandoned their own ideals after being confronted with the realities of governing. Most recently, Barack Obama won the presidency with a campaign that emphasized change and rejected a political system that he said was broken. During the Democratic primaries, Obama had differentiated himself from Sen. Hillary Clinton by blasting her for an ""Inside the Beltway"" mentality, depicting her as someone who, like her husband, was too willing to cut deals and too cozy with the interest groups that lurk on K Street. Yet President Obama dropped most of his reform agenda soon after entering office. When pushing for signature legislation such as health care and financial regulation, the administration and Congress cut deals with the interest groups he once derided. Democrats and Republicans have continued to scramble for private dollars to fund their campaigns. The political process looks very much the same in 2010 as it did in 2008. The Republican freshmen who took control of Congress in 1994 with similar promises also came to adapt to the ways of Washington. After the shutdown of the federal government that resulted from the budget standoff with President Clinton, many of the freshmen tempered their outlook as they compromised on issues such as Medicare. They also mastered the parliamentary procedures they once decried and developed ties with interest groups to advance their agenda. By 2006, the Republicans, who in their ""Contract with America"" had promised to ""transform the way Congress works,"" looked very much like the establishment. The political process is more than a backdrop to decision-making. The process constrains what politicians can and can't do. For example, the fact that the campaigns are financed with private money ensures that lobbyists and interest groups wield influence. Unless Congress passes government reforms such as publicly financed elections to change that process, Tea Party politicians will either have to deal with it or languish. Furthermore, the separation of power and the nature of the legislative process require compromise to achieve legislation. It is misguided to condemn politicians for practicing a quintessentially American political art. The president and Congress must agree on legislation, other than rare moments when there is a super-majority to override a veto. The internally fragmented House and Senate must also reach agreement through a deliberative process filled with procedural traps such as the filibuster. A Tea Party Republican can complain all he or she wants about compromise, but on Capitol Hill, a new member of Congress is unlikely to get anything done without cutting a deal. Finally, voters in both red and blue states depend on federal spending. Although Tea Party candidates castigate earmarks, government spending and pork barrel politics, all of those who are victorious will represent constituencies profoundly affected by the money that Congress allocates every year. In Alaska, the political birthplace of Sarah Palin and the scene of another recent Tea Party victory, the state has depended on federal dollars for jobs and infrastructure. Indeed, the Southern and Western states, which have been the home to the conservative movement since the 1970s, have depended on military contracts since the Cold War as a pillar of their economy. Voters should be extremely skeptical about the kinds of promises that candidates such as O'Donnell are making. They have seen this movie before, and they know how it ends. In the end, voters should pay less attention to the anti-Washington rhetoric and take a closer look at the specific policies that these candidates hope to pursue. Doing so will allow voters to make a more realistic assessment of what their victories would mean for the nation. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian E. Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer says anti-D.C. candidates promise to change the ways of the capital .
He says President Obama didn't deliver the political reform he promised .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- For days, relatives, friends and much of Pakistan have been waiting for a sign that a 14-year-old blogger and activist will survive being shot in the neck by would-be assassins. On Saturday, they finally got it. ""She moved her limbs today when doctors reduced sedation to make a clinical assessment,"" military spokesman Maj. Gen. Asim Bajwa said. Malala Yousufzai remains under the close watch of doctors at a Rawalpindi hospital, as she fights to recover from her attempted assassination on Tuesday. Bajwa said Friday that ""the next 36 to 48 hours are important"" in deciding whether she makes it through, or not. Even with the progress, the girl still has a long road ahead. She remained unconscious and on a ventilator Saturday. Young Malala had become a Pakistani and international icon for her efforts defending the right of girls to go to school where she lives, the Taliban-heavy Swat Valley. She was riding home in a school van this week in the tense region, which rests along the Afghan border, when gunmen jumped into the vehicle and demanded to know which girl she was. Her horrified classmates pointed to her, and the men fired. Two other girls were wounded, but not seriously. Since then, supporters have gathered around the country for small vigils to pray for her recovery. Government officials in Peshawar, the main city in the northwestern region where Malala is from, were silent for one minute in her honor. An international team of neurological specialists said her condition was stable Friday, but they were monitoring her closely. Her family waits, and hopes, yet they are afraid to give away where they are exactly. They're terrified that Taliban who would gun down a teenager wouldn't hesitate to come after them. The Malalas you'll never meet . Brave blogger . Malala gained fame for blogging about how girls should have rights in Pakistan, including the right to learn. She spoke out in a region of the country where support for Islamic fundamentalism runs high. ""I have the right of education,"" she said in a CNN interview last year. ""I have the right to play. I have the right to sing. I have the right to talk. I have the right to go to market. I have the right to speak up."" Malala, whose writing earned her Pakistan's first National Peace Prize, also encouraged young people to take a stand against the Taliban -- and to not hide in their bedrooms. ""God will ask you on the day of judgment where were you when your people were asking you ... when your school fellows were asking you, and when your school was asking you,"" she said in her CNN interview, ""['Why] I am being blown up?'"" The Taliban believe no girl should be educated, and they've threatened that if Malala survives, they will murder her. Despite the threat, some Pakistani schoolgirls are saying Malala's shooting won't stop them from continuing their education. ""In our society, girls don't have rights and they don't get to study, but I think that's completely wrong,"" one of the girls told a CNN reporter. ""I think we have the same rights as men and we will stand up for our rights. And we will go out and encourage all girls to study."" Police make arrests, close in on attackers . Police arrested 200 suspects, but released all but 35. Those still in detention gave police information that led to the arrest of three more suspects, said Ghulam Muhammad, a local government official. Though many Pakistanis are appalled by the attack, the Taliban have kept up their vicious comments, saying that they figured shooting the teenager would have an impact in the West. ""We do not tolerate people like Malala speaking against us,"" Taliban spokesman Ihsanullah Ihsan said. Opinion: Girl's courage, Taliban's cowardice . 'Malala is Pakistan's daughter' Indeed, the attack did stir global debate. Leaders across the world spoke out, including those in Pakistan. The teenager has come to symbolize a battle between freedom and oppression, violence and peace, a young generation and a group that is hell-bent on keeping Pakistan under the grip of Islamic extremism. ""Malala is Pakistan's daughter, Pakistan's real face, Pakistan's messenger of love and peace,"" Pakistani Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf said. The country is fighting terrorism because it's a ""menace."" On her blog, Malala often wrote about her life in Swat Valley, a hotbed of militant activity. The valley near the Afghanistan border once attracted tourists to Pakistan's only ski resort, as well as visitors to the ancient Buddhist ruins in the area. But that was before militants -- their faces covered -- unleashed a wave of violence. They demanded veils for women, beards for men and a ban on music and television. They allowed boys' schools to operate but closed those for girls. ""We have sacrificed, both man and material and our valiant armed forces, innocent children, citizens, workers and leaders,"" Ashraf said Friday. ""But now the nation is united and we have to unite and stand together to uproot this menace from our motherland and our children."" Speaking in Rawalpindi, Ashraf thanked political leaders and others who have stood up in support of Malala. ""We would together like to give this message to fight against the mindset that attacked her,"" he said. 'Education is the best thing' At Islamabad's Khaldunia High School, students hung banners and wrote letters demanding that the government do everything possible to save Malala. Girls look up to Malala, said one female student whose identity CNN isn't revealing to protect her safety. ""I was really shocked because she was so ambitious ..."" she said. ""I pray for her health."" ""To have the courage to actually go against all that,"" another girl said. ""I think that was quite respectable."" A reporter asked if the attack has inspired them and if they planned to speak up even louder. ""I want these people who attacked her to learn that women are not all bad,"" one girl answered. ""They are basically afraid of giving women equal rights because they're afraid of what women can do because they know they can do a lot. ""I want to speak up so they can learn some lessons from that message."" One boy said he wanted to study more because of Malala. He won't take going to school for granted anymore, he said. ""What I learned from her is that education is the best thing, and if I get an education, I will be a better person,"" said another boy, 14. A 'barbaric act' President Asif Ali Zardari told Malala's father Friday that he was grieving and in shock over her shooting, and he condemned ""the barbaric act of the militants,"" according to a news release from his office. The president also said Malala and the other two victims of the attack should get free medical care. Photos: Who are the Taliban? Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar on Thursday called the attempted assassination of Malala ""a wake-up call"" for the nation. Pakistani media reports suggested that the government is considering sending her overseas for treatment, but Bajwa, the military spokesman, said Friday that there is no plan yet to do that. Media inside Pakistan continue to debate how to respond to Malala's shooting. ""Just as the Taliban scare us with terror, we must scare them by making them unable to operate,"" Madiha Afzal, an assistant professor at the University of Maryland who grew up in Pakistan, wrote in an opinion piece published in The Express Tribune. ""We must terrorize them by investing more than ever before in educating girls,"" she said. Former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, now the U.N. special envoy for global education, has traveled to Pakistan and advocated for girls' education there. He said in an editorial published Friday that Zardari has invited him to return in November to lead a delegation of education leaders to come up with ways to improve opportunities for children. ""I have asked Pakistan's President Zardari to pledge that Malala's suffering will not be in vain,"" he wrote. Education a focus on International Day of the Girl .

"(CNN) -- The world of social media burst with excitement Friday as millions took to Twitter, Facebook and other sites to join a virtual wedding party for Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. At the peak, there were 300 tweets per second using the Royal Wedding hashtag, according to Tweetminster, a news platform which monitors activity on Twitter. As Catherine stepped out of her car for the ceremony, nearly 9.4% of all tweets worldwide mentioned the word ""wedding,"" according to Trendistic, which also monitors Twitter trends. ""I wish Kate & Willem the very best in their marriage! :),"" Mark Kwakernaak of Rotterdam in the Netherlands posted on Twitter. For Americans, the royal nuptials meant a pre-dawn start to the day. For some, it conjured a bit of nostalgia. ""Yes, I set my alarm to wake up early to watch the #RoyalWedding,"" said Renee Nicole, who tweeted from northern Colorado. ""I remember watching Prince Charles & Princess Diana's wedding, with my Mom."" Much of the Internet buzz surrounded what gown Catherine would wear down the aisle. ""I just can't wait to see the DRESS!"" Stephanie Golangelo tweeted from Cleveland. ""More than anything, I wanna see Kate's dress!"" echoed Mary Pranica of Minneapolis. Celebrities also joined in the online excitement. Victoria Beckham, a guest at the wedding with her footballer husband David, wrote on Twitter Thursday night: ""London looks beautiful!!! We are so proud to be British!"" ""London's looking delightful today! Flags at the ready!"" wrote Harry Potter actor Tom Felton. Television personality Joan Rivers joked: ""I just read that the Royal Wedding is likely to have 2 billion viewers! Many of them will be air-traffic controllers watching at work."" British celebrity chef Jamie Oliver wrote: ""Royal wedding day !! national day off!! have a great day today guys, I hope it includes family, friends, bad dancing food and a little drink."" Former Spice Girl Mel B -- now living in Los Angeles -- said she was ""getting sooo excited about the wedding, up at 5am to comment about it."" ""Wake up Kath-eters!"" comedienne Kathy Griffin wrote. ""Wanna hear ur thoughts on all things royal wedding."" ""Congrats to William and Kate ...and Kate's sister,"" wrote Justin Bieber, who is currently on tour in Sydney, Australia. The wedding proved to be a bit of downer for those thinking they had a shot at one of the world's most eligible bachelors, while others decided to look at the bright side. ""Ladies, CALM DOWN u can still MARRY HARRY :),"" Aditya Pratama of Jakarta, Indonesia, said on Twitter. Lauren Demitry of Buffalo, New York, took a similar approach. ""That's okay. I rather marry Harry anyways,"" she said. While the Twitter feed for the royal wedding surged with dozens of comments a minute, not all of them were -- shall we say -- for family reading. ""Who gives a damn about the #RoyalWedding seriously?"" was a frequently repeated post that can be shared. Many marveled at the universal appeal of the event held at Westminster Abbey. ""Even my brother is keeping up with the #RoyalWedding more than me,"" tweeted Liana Borja of Guam. As the wedding drew near, a ""Runaway Bride"" theme appeared. In the 1999 movie, starring Julia Roberts and Richard Gere, a woman left a string of fiances at the alter. ""Speak now or forever hold your peace... 'Kate, damn it - run!'"" Jo Garfein of northern California suggested on Twitter. ""Now THAT would make the #RoyalWedding more interesting.""","NEW: There were 300 tweets per second using the Royal Wedding hashtag at the peak of the excitement .

"(CNN) -- There's a hilarious episode of the sketch comedy show ""Portlandia"" where two hipster parents give their preschool age kid a presentation about his future. The kid, Grover, half-watches as mom and dad pull up two stock market-style charts: One shows his fortunes going up and up if he attends Shooting Star preschool; the other shows what happens if he fails to get in: a plunge into violence, shoplifting and poverty. ""The last thing I want is you out there, you know, shooting squirrels and birds for dinner,"" says the mom. ""If we don't get you into that Shooting Star private preschool, you're gonna end up at a public school with a bunch of riffraff."" She adds: ""We're gonna get you into preschool. We're gonna get you into college. We're going to get you some money. And we're gonna get you whatever you want!"" The skit is great because it's based in truth. Yes, elite preschool admissions are perfectly absurd, but the benefits of preschool are seriously significant. Researchers in North Carolina and Michigan have spent decades following kids who attend preschool and comparing them with control groups of kids who didn't. While preschool, of course, does not single-handedly determine whether a kid will be successful and happy or end up shoplifting with the riffraff, on the whole the studies suggest the early schooling can reroute lives for the better. The ""Portlandia"" charts are kind of real. My View: Not all preschools are created equal . That's why every one of us should hope that Congress comes up with a way to pay for President Barack Obama's proposal that all American kids get access to preschool -- starting with those who are less likely to be able to pay for it themselves. The kind of outlay that would require might sound ridiculous at a moment when the country is headed toward Fiscal Cliff Part Deux, or ""the sequester."" But talk to the researchers who have been following kids from preschool and into their 20s, 30s and 40s, and you begin to see how transformative early education can and should be. Ultimately, it's a cost-effective investment in a future when poor kids have the same chance at success as the obsessed-over Grovers of the world. ""Unequivocally, yes, I think it works,"" said Frances Campbell, a senior scientist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ""I don't think there's any question about that."" In 1972, Campbell's university began a project to track the success of a group of preschoolers and a similar control group of kids who were not given access to preschool. The 1970s start date ""tells you I am ancient, which I am,"" Campbell said. She's 80 now, and the research subjects are turning 40. The ongoing study is like the science-y version of the ""7-Up"" documentary series -- with researchers checking in on the lives of the subjects at several-year intervals. The differences between those who had preschool and those who didn't ""aren't huge,"" she said, but they are significant. ""What matters to me,"" she said on the phone, ""is that when they were 21 years old if they had had that preschool experience they were more likely to be in college and when they were 30 they were more likely to have graduated from college."" In Michigan, Larry Schweinhart is an early childhood program researcher at the nonprofit education research organization HighScope. His group also found positive, long-term results. Kids who went to preschool in the mid-'60s were less likely to have been arrested several times by age 40, were more likely to have graduated from high school and were likely to earn more than non-pre-K kids studied. Some have criticized those studies, saying the preschools were too well-funded and fussed over for their successes to be replicated elsewhere. In North Carolina, Campbell said, kids also got help that extended before and after the typical preschool years of age 3 and 4. Others say the study sample sizes -- about 100 kids in each case -- may be too small to support sweeping conclusions. The effectiveness of public early education programs also have been called into question. A 2012 report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services found students in the Head Start program made early educational strides -- but that they faded by the time the students reached third grade. Schweinhart said that expanding preschool programs across the nation won't automatically improve lives. But if the programs are funded and managed well, he said, they will have real impact. That seems like a reasonable assessment, and it's one that's more or less shared by professor David Kirp of the University of California, Berkeley. ""Whether universal prekindergarten really makes a difference in children's lives or turns out to be a false hope,"" Kirp wrote recently for a CNN blog, ""depends entirely on the quality of what's being offered."" Perhaps the real impact of preschool is most visible in the lives of real people who attended decades ago and now are adults. I asked the researchers in North Carolina and Michigan if I could talk to some of the people who are the subjects of their studies. They declined, saying that since the studies are ongoing the people must have anonymity so as not to skew results. So I went to the next best thing -- two women who attended a HighScope preschool in Michigan but weren't part of the studies the group ran. I wanted to know if they actually, really, truly thought that their lives today had been changed by the fact that they went to some classes decades ago. I figured they wouldn't remember much. But, to my surprise, both Simone Strong, 39, and Katie Jones, 33, told me their experiences around age 3 still mattered past 30. Jones is in a wheelchair and she said the school gave her the confidence she would need to confront people who might see her as different. Strong said the school was ""empowering"" and is part of the reason she has had the confidence to serve on the boards of socially minded organizations in her community. Both of their children now go to the same preschool -- in part because their older, wiser mothers realize what a big impact preschool had on their adult lives. It seems like all kids should have those opportunities. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John D. Sutter.","John Sutter: Research proves the effectiveness of preschool .

"(CNN) -- Tom de la Hunty took Dutch bobsledder Edwin van Calker to the Whistler Sliding Center track one last time Tuesday and asked his driver if he could do it. He wasn't asking him to win; he was asking him whether he could compete. The coach and his pilot walked the course, and de la Hunty told van Calker to think about it, giving him an hour to make a decision. Time offered no healing. Van Calker told his coach he just couldn't drive this track and so on Wednesday the four-man No. 1 sled from the Netherlands pulled out of the Olympics. Because their driver was terrified. ""I've never seen someone get to a major event and not compete because they're scared. You keep your inner fears to yourself and do it,"" de la Hunty told reporters at a news conference. ""That's why it's such a popular sport in the military. It's that kind of macho sport. You go over the top together."" Van Calker, ranked 11th on the World Cup four-man tour, crashed on his first run during two-man practice on Saturday. That and the memories of other crashes, including one that resulted in two teammates in the hospital, were too much for van Calker. He never felt comfortable on the track during the two-man competition when he and teammate Sybren Jansma finished 14th. He and the rest of the four-man team were absent from two training runs on Tuesday, as he struggled with what to do. It didn't help that eight sleds crashed on that first day of training. And so that night, he made the decision to give up. ""I have to look after my boys and can't close my eyes to that,"" he told reporters. ""For me, it's not about performing. It's about surviving."" It was a split decision among the team to quit the games, said de la Hunty, who talked about how he told his driver he was making a choice he would regret forever. ""I've told him that to his face,""de la Hunty said, ""but as a coach I have to support it because I'm responsible for him sending his team down the track in the right frame of mind."" For Timothy Beck, who wanted to continue, it was a heart-wrenching outcome to his last Olympics. The man who carried the Dutch flag in the opening ceremonies said there was no tension on the team, but he wasn't the one looking out for three teammates. ""If you ask me if I want to slide I'd say, 'Yes'. But I don't have to steer; I just get in the back and go down. I don't have the responsibility,"" said Beck. But he also said he was upset that he'd come to his third Olympics and would not get a chance to compete. ""This was my last chance to do something special,"" said the 33-year-old, who competed in the 2002 Winter Olympics and the 2004 Summer Olympics on the track team. Jansma said he was frustrated because he wanted to show the world the progress the Netherlands has made in bobsled, but safety was paramount. Arnold van Calker, the fourth member of the team, supported his brother's decision, pointing to the difference in the size of the two- and four-man sleds. The two-man sled is smaller and easier to control. Arnold van Calker, who had his doubts about the safety of the track, worried his brother had lost his nerve and wouldn't be able to steer the big sled through turns 11, 12 and 13. Not even changes to the track on Tuesday could help reassure the brothers. ""It was a lot better, but for us it was maybe too late,"" Arnold van Calker said. De la Hunty pinned some of the blame on Arnold's wife, saying that she had been worried about her husband's safety ever since Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili had crashed and died on the same track during the first day of the games. ""When Arnold is scared and upset, obviously it has influence,"" he said. But Arnold van Calker said the death had no influence, and Edwin van Calker agreed that the track was not to blame for his decision. ""It's a challenging and exciting track. You have to deal with it as a pilot. That comes with the job. Sometimes you deal with it less good,"" he said. ""It's nothing to do with the track, just my lack of confidence at the moment."" Competition in the four-man competition starts Friday with the medals decided on Saturday after the last of four runs.","NEW: Coach Tom de la Hunty: ""I have to support"" the pilot's decision .

"Chicago (CNN) -- Doctors and patients have a new tool to prevent breast cancer: A drug that is already approved for the treatment of the disease. Women who are at high risk for breast cancer that is fueled by the hormone estrogen could reduce their risk of getting cancer by taking the hormone-blocking drug Aromasin, according to a study presented at a conference in Chicago on Saturday. ""We proved that exemestane (Aromasin) reduced the risk of invasive breast cancer by 65%,"" said lead author Dr. Paul Goss, who is a breast cancer specialist at Boston's Massachusetts General Hospital. Goss presented his research at the annual conference of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. The study has also been published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Aromasin is one of three drugs in the class of drugs called aromatase inhibitors, which block the production of estrogen in postmenopausal women. Two other estrogen-blocking drugs exist, but few women use them to prevent breast cancer because there are rare but serious possible side effects, such as an increased risk of uterine cancer and blood clots. Previous studies showed that cancer drug tamoxifen reduced the risk of getting breast cancer in older women by 50% and osteoporosis drug raloxifene reduced the risk by 38% after five years of taking the drugs. Exemestane, better known under the brand name Aromasin. was found to have fewer side effects than tamoxifen, according to Goss. His study enrolled 4,560 healthy postmenopausal women at high risk for breast cancer in a placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical trial. The 65% risk reduction was found after women had been taking the drugs for only three years. The study continues. ""This is the first study to show that a new class of drugs, aromatase inhibitors, have the ability to prevent breast cancer in high-risk women,"" said Dr. Jennifer Litton, who is a breast cancer specialist at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and is not connected to this research. Litton says she prescribes tamoxifen a lot in her practice and believes it's a very good and very affordable drug. But when she tells women about the possible side effects like uterine cancer, ""it definitely scares women away, even though the incidence of these side effects is really rare."" She hopes more women in the high-risk category will now be open to taking a cancer-preventing drug like Aromasin. Dr. Jose Baselga is the associate director of Massachusetts General's Cancer Center, but did not participate in the research. He says the study is very good but cautions that the side effects of Aromasin should not be ignored. ""Aromatase inhibitors do have side effects and they are significant,"" Baselga said. Women can have hot flashes, get arthritis and suffer bone loss from taking the drugs, which can have a big impact on a woman's quality of life, especially for someone who doesn't actually have cancer, he said. He also pointed out that 94 women were treated with this drug and did not benefit before one woman was prevented from getting breast cancer. So when it comes to prescribing Aromasin, ""I would limit it to patients who have very high risks"" for getting breast cancer, Baselga said. According to the study, women taking Aromasin had no serious toxic effects and only ""minimal changes in health-related quality of life."" Women are considered to be at high risk for breast cancer if they are older than 60, postmenopausal and/or have had abnormal breast biopsies in which there are some lesions. All the experts agree that women need to talk to their doctor to fully understand the risks and benefits of taking these drugs to prevent getting breast cancer. Pfizer, the maker of Aromasin, announced in May that the U.S. patent for this drug had expired, making it eligible for generic drug manufacturers to produce and sell it. Goss expects the price of this drug to decline quickly because of this. However, he says Pfizer would not reveal to him if they plan to ask for an extension of their patent based on this research. A spokesperson for the company, which funded some of this research, would not comment on this topic either.","Study shows Aromasin has fewer side effects than rivals .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Daniel Guadalupe stared at the passport application in front of him, dumbfounded. His problem was not the questions asked, but the language they were written in. ""I don't speak Spanish very well,"" he said as he struggled to fill out the Mexican government form. ""I'll have to call my mom."" The 18-year-old is one of more than a million people that U.S. officials estimate could benefit from the Obama administration's deferred deportation program aimed at illegal immigrants younger than 30 who came to the United States before the age of 16. Details about how immigrants can apply for the program, which administration officials announced last month, have not been released. But already young people are flooding Mexican consular offices around the United States, trying to get the citizenship documents they'll need from their home country in order to ask for a reprieve from U.S. immigration officials. For immigrants, recent policy changes are personal . This week, Guadalupe waited in a long line at the Mexican consulate in Atlanta before a clerk took his fingerprints, reviewed his documents and helped him fill out the passport form in a language he sometimes struggles to understand. The high school senior was born in Mexico but brought illegally to the United States when he was 8 years old. Most of the people he hangs out with speak English, the teen said, and he only speaks Spanish with his parents. Getting a passport from a country he barely remembers is the first step to get into college, Guadalupe said. He hopes to study music somewhere in Georgia, the state where he's lived since arriving in the United States. ""I feel like I need this opportunity to become a U.S. citizen,"" he said. But first, he must prove he is a Mexican. The process is not always simple for young immigrants in the United States who don't have birth certificates or passports handy, said Abigail Calleja, consul for protection at the Mexican consulate in Atlanta. Some of the hundreds of children who have lined up at the consulate over the past few weeks have no idea where their father is, Calleja said. That's a problem because Mexican law requires kids under 18 to have the signature and fingerprints from both parents. ""But let me assure you that nobody will lose (his or her) chance to apply for the program because of a passport. We will do what we need to help these kids,"" she said. Mexican officials at consulates nationwide are preparing to help those who would qualify for the new U.S. program. ""We are asking them to stay alert to our websites and other places where official information is issued,"" she said. All 50 consular offices in the United States have organized information sessions on the issue, and consular officials are also carefully reviewing documents to avoid fraudulent applications, she said. The Obama administration's shift last month on the politically volatile issue of immigration policy prompted immediate praise from Latino leaders who have criticized Congress and the White House for inaction, while Republicans reacted with outrage, saying the move amounts to amnesty and usurps congressional authority. Under the new policy, people younger than 30 who came to the United States before the age of 16, who pose no criminal or security threat and were successful students or served in the military can get a two-year deferral from deportation, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said last month. It also will allow those meeting the requirements to apply for work permits, Napolitano said, adding that participants must be in the United States now and be able to prove they have been living in the country continuously for at least five years. In Mexico, Central American immigrants under fire . Up to 1.2 million illegal immigrants could benefit from the program, according to U.S. government estimates. More than 58% of the estimated 11.2 million illegal immigrants in the United States are Mexican, the Pew Hispanic Center said last year. Calleja said she did not know how many Mexican citizens would require consular services associated with the new U.S. program. But those who qualify can come to the consulate without an appointment, receive assistance and have their request prioritized, she said. This week, Karina Vasquez and her brother came to the Atlanta consulate to start processing their paperwork so they can apply for the U.S. deferral program. ""It will allow me to go to college, to get a job and feel safe here,"" the 18-year-old said as she waited in line to get her picture taken. Her mother, Rocio Medina, said she brought her children to the United States 10 years ago to give them a better chance to succeed in life and to reunite their family. ""Their father was already here, and we didn't want to be apart,"" she said. Now, Medina said she hopes the U.S. program will not only help her children, but also help lead to a change in her immigration status in the future. When one passport isn't enough .

"(CNN) -- A Frenchman was captured among jihadists fighting international forces in northern Mali and is being extradited to France, the French defense minister said Friday. French forces are dealing with ""determined terrorists"" in Mali, said Defense Minister Jean Yves Le Drian, speaking to French radio station Europe 1 from the African nation's capital, Bamako. Mali: The long, troubled desert road ahead . And the presence of the French citizen among them, as well as a French-Algerian man who was arrested last weekend, demonstrates how northern Mali had become a magnet for extremists, he said. ""This shows that there existed a kind of terrorist war network, which would welcome young people in search of a radical destiny, as some have done in Afghanistan or Syria,"" he told the radio station. The French-Algerian man, who was sought by French police, was detained by Malian officers in northern Mali, Le Drian said. He was extradited Thursday to France, he said. Read more: What's behind the instability in Mali? ""We knew that this part of Mali was potentially the sanctuary of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. We were not mistaken, this is the case,"" Le Drian said. ""We are dealing with determined terrorists, who are heavily armed and who are waging significant battles and inflicting major damage."" Islamist extremists carved out a large haven in northern Mali last year, taking advantage of a chaotic situation after a military coup by the separatist party MNLA. The militants banned music, smoking, drinking and watching sports on television. They also destroyed historic tombs and shrines. French involvement in the conflict began on January 11, the day after militants said they had seized the city of Konna, east of Diabaly in central Mali, and were poised to advance south toward Bamako, the capital. Nearly 4,000 French soldiers are now deployed in Mali, according to the French Defense Ministry website, alongside about 6,300 troops from Chad and the African-led International Support Mission to Mali. Q&A: What's behind the instability in Mali? In the past few weeks, French and African forces have helped Malian troops drive the militants out of their strongholds in the north, including cities like Gao, Kidal and Timbuktu. Some of their number are believed to now to be hiding out in remote mountains near the border with Algeria. French troops are continuing to ""comb"" through the Adrar des Ifoghas Mountains for the militants, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said Thursday, and are keeping a strong presence in Gao, where ""important pockets of terrorist groups remain."" France is using DNA tests to identify the Islamist fighters killed in recent battles in northern Mali, Fabius said. Those tests could establish whether Moktar Belmoktar or Abdelhamid Abou Zeid -- two men who have been major forces in al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb -- are among the dead, as has been suggested by others but not confirmed by France. France will begin to reduce its troop levels in Mali next month in an effort to have West African forces, with the support of the United Nations, take over and maintain security in the country, Fabius said.","A Frenchman found among jihadists in Mali is being extradited, French official says .

"Washington (CNN) -- Senate Republicans will block Democrats from taking up a White House-backed bill to cap rates on some student loans unless Democrats allow a vote on a GOP alternative, the second-ranking Senate Republican said Monday. Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl predicted such a confrontation could lead to an ultimate compromise on the legislation before rates are set to double in July, something lawmakers from both parties and the White House want to prevent. ""We'll defeat cloture,"" Kyl said, using the legislative parlance for a key procedural vote scheduled for Tuesday that requires 60 votes to succeed. If Republicans prove Democrats can't move a bill without GOP support, ""I presume leaders in the House and Senate will get together and find a way to ensure the interest rate doesn't double,"" Kyl said. An aide to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said negotiations over the issue are still under way. Interest rates on federal student loans are scheduled to double from the current 3.4% in July unless Congress acts. But Democrats and Republicans disagree over how to offset the $6 billion it would cost to keep the rates down: Democrats want to eliminate a tax break for some corporations while Republicans want to pull funds from a preventative health care fund set up under the health reform law. Each spending plan is opposed by the other party. President Barack Obama has led a high profile, multi-pronged lobbying push to pressure Republicans to support the Democrats' bill. Kyl said Republicans are ""really disappointed"" Reid has not agreed to hold a vote on the Republican funding alternative.","Kyl says Republicans want a Senate vote on their plan .

"Midland City, Alabama (CNN) -- Residents of Midland City, Alabama, gathered to show support and offer prayers for the family of a 5-year-old hostage held in a bunker. Saturday marked the fifth day of an armed standoff in that town, where authorities are negotiating through a ventilation pipe with the man accused of barricading himself and the boy underground. Police have been tight-lipped about a possible motive since the hostage drama began unfolding with the shooting of school bus driver and the abduction of the 5-year-old. In a sign of perhaps how tense negotiations are between authorities and the suspect, officials have refused to detail what, if any, demands have been made by the suspect. Michelle Riley, a resident of Midland City, pleaded for the suspect to let the boy go. ""He just needs to know that ... everybody makes mistakes. Everybody's been through life events that changes them, but (the boy's) innocent. You know, let him go home to his mother. Let him go home to his grandparents. Let him come out to the community. Let him go back to school and be with his friends,"" she said. She spoke at a Saturday vigil for the boy held outside the Midland City town hall. Residents there sang ""Amazing Grace."" ""I'm here in support of this family,"" said Deborah Trammell, also at the vigil. She explained that she lost a son five years ago in a car accident. ""I can relate to this family because they've had a child all of a sudden plucked out of their lives,"" she said. On Friday, the Dale County sheriff confirmed what neighbors have been saying and local news outlets have been reporting since the standoff began -- the suspected gunman's identity. 'We don't want to make any mistakes,' Ala. governor says . He is Jimmy Lee Dykes, 65, a Vietnam veteran and retired truck driver who moved to the area about five years ago. The sheriff's department released a photo of a gray-bearded, unsmiling Dykes and brief physical description: white male, 6 feet tall, weighing 170 pounds with brown eyes and gray hair. Officials have been in ""constant communication"" with Dykes, Sheriff Wally Olson said Saturday. Dykes has told police that he has an electric heater and blankets for the boy. The sheriff publicly thanked Dykes for taking care of the child. This much is known, according to police and witness statements: On Tuesday at about 3:40 p.m., bus driver Charles Poland Jr. was shuttling children from school to their homes when he dropped children off and the gunman boarded the bus. The gunman demanded that Poland, 66, hand over two children. Poland refused, blocking access to the bus's narrow aisle as at least 21 children escaped out of the back emergency door, according to police. The gunman shot Poland four times, killing him; grabbed the boy and then barricaded the two of them inside a nearby bunker. It's unclear whether the gunman was after a specific child on the bus. Police have said there is no connection between the suspect and the abducted boy, whose identity is being withheld. The suspect, who police have identified as Dykes, is holed up in a bunker 4 feet underground and built at least partially out of PVC pipe, authorities have said. A hostage negotiator has been communicating with the alleged gunman through a 60-foot-long plastic ventilation pipe in an effort to end the standoff. Authorities believe the boy is physically unharmed. The suspect agreed to let police send down coloring books, crayons and prescription medication that the boy needs for treatment for Asperger's syndrome and attention deficit disorder, State Rep. Steve Clouse told CNN. Neighbors have said the bunker has electricity, and Dykes has been known to stay in it for up to eight days, said James Arrington, the police chief in nearby Pinckard. Dykes has been described as a self-styled survivalist with ""anti-government"" views, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center's Hatewatch. The incident called to mind another bus hijacking. In 1976, three masked men boarded a school bus in Chowchilla, California, taking 26 children and their driver hostage. They were forced into a buried vehicle, where they spent 16 terrifying hours before they were able to escape. Jennifer Hyde was on that bus. She was 9 years old, and described what happened as the end of her childhood. ""You couldn't just go on and have a normal childhood when you faced a life threatening situation like that. You just can't go on and be carefree,"" she told CNN's Don Lemon. She said her heart goes out to the boyet: ""I can't imagine him being alone in the situation that he's in. At least I was able to have other children with me and one adult that I knew and could trust."" As negotiations in Alabama continue, preparations were under way for Poland's funeral. Services for the late school bus driver will be held Sunday at the Ozark Civic Center. Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley praised Poland for protecting the children on his bus.

And he lost his life because of that ... he did his job, and I'm proud of him as the governor but I'm just proud of him as a human being,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Danielle Jackson still remembers the day she discovered her own mother could be her own worst enemy. She was paying for her lunch when her debit card got rejected in front of everyone. She ran back to the bank where she worked and pulled her records, only to discover a middle-of-the-night withdrawal from a bank near her mother's home. The night before, as she was sleeping, it looked like her own mother had nearly emptied her account. ""It was embarrassing. It was hurtful,"" said Danielle, who remembers thinking that her co-workers at the bank must wonder how a mother could steal her child's money. ""It was only a small amount of money, but it hurt worse than anything she's done, because she took something from me."" I have met these Danielle Jacksons many times over, young women whose own mothers drag them down even as they already face terrible odds. These are mothers who engage in a stunning role reversal at the very moment their children need them most, demanding their daughters become caregivers, bail them out of trouble, support them when they can barely support themselves. The first warning sign is neglect . This alarming role reversal begins with neglect. Each year, the Administration for Children and Families records 6 million cases of child abuse or neglect, 80% of them cases where parents, many of them mothers, put their own children at risk. What sometimes happens next, but you don't hear about as often, is that many of those mothers demand their children care for them, even after they stopped caring for their children. ""Those mothers can have many needs themselves, and the one person who can fulfill those needs is that child,"" says Alicia Salzer, a psychiatrist and the author of ""Back to Life: Getting Past Your Past With Resilience, Strength, and Optimism,"" a book about how people can overcome trauma. The problem is particularly acute among children of the poor and of substance abusers, children who already face obstacles getting ahead. I know a young woman named Whitney who aspired to finish college and thought she might even count on her mother for some minimal help with the huge loans she needed to pay for school. Instead, she says, her mother used her Social Security number to rent an apartment. She left Whitney with unpaid bills and ruined credit. Mia (not her real name) was raising her son by herself and trying to go to school. Even as she struggled to find baby-sitting and juggle her schoolwork, her mother treated her like a renter, expressing jealousy that Mia was getting to go to school. Then there was Terry, a beautiful dark-eyed academic superstar, whose mother barely provided for her, even as she had so many unmet needs. One day when Terry was in high school, she came home to discover her mother had gone to live with her boyfriend. ""She left,"" she told me. I could see everything in this young lady closing down as she said the words. ""Did she tell you where she was going?"" I asked. ""No,"" she said. And we both began to cry. No idea of normal . ""To these girls, normal is something that looks like a Disney film,"" says Salzer. ""They have no idea what a normal mother-daughter relationship looks like. They get used to it being this way, so it just continues."" A common thread in such relationships, says Salzer, is substance abuse, because it gives the mother something in her life that overshadows her children, blurs judgment and creates need. That's been the case for Danielle. Her mother, Regina, was addicted to crack when she became pregnant. She was already having trouble raising two sons and had no job and no stable relationship. Regina is frank when she tells her side of the story: . ""Being honest with you, I told Danielle I didn't want her even when I was pregnant, but I'm glad I didn't get rid of her. They had told me I couldn't have any more kids, and I went out on a drug spree. I was so surprised when I found out I was pregnant, I had to check into a mental institution for six months to get over it."" Danielle ended up living with her grandmother, where she thrived and became a good student. Her mother loomed over her like a dark shadow, entering and re-entering her life as she faced her addictions. Danielle went to college; her mother went to jail. Her grandmother's diagnosis of cancer forced Danielle to make a heart-wrenching decision. ""My grandmother had taken care of me, and now I had to take care of her,"" Danielle recalls. She left college, a mountain of debt wasted, and began caring for her grandmother. Her mother seemed like she might rally and help her out, but once again, it wasn't to be. ""I thought this would bring my mother and I together, but all she did was cry and cry,"" Danielle remembers. As Danielle watched her grandmother succumb to cancer, her mother brought new problems. Danielle bought her a car, and Regina got drunk and had an accident. The car was impounded. Danielle paid a fine. Regina's boyfriend was stopped on a DUI, which was another fine. Then a relative crashed the car, leading to hundreds of dollars in repairs. Regina recalls how Danielle stood by her. ""She took care of six or seven payday loans. She took care of me,"" she said. ""She is a good person to lean on."" After Danielle's grandmother died, her mother leaned even harder, falling into debt by buying insurance policies for every family member. Danielle again had to step in and rescue her mother. ""I've struggled because I love her, and I was raised to respect her as my mom. She didn't give me up for adoption,"" said Danielle. ""But it's a struggle."" Outside intervention . That is when our foundation stepped in. My husband and I started the Soledad O'Brien Brad Raymond Foundation two years ago to help promising girls who were future leaders. We wanted to help them navigate around the people and things that become obstacles to their success. We also wanted to give them the funding that puts them within reach of a better life through education. We have adopted 23 scholars so far. Our mentors aim to give our girls a taste of what a functional family looks like by helping them with simple things such as choosing clothes for an interview, shopping for textbooks or celebrating good grades. We sent Danielle back to college and assigned a mentor to help her navigate her upside-down relationship with her mother. It was clear from the outset that Danielle couldn't let go of her mom easily. ""She needs me too much for me to move away. It's almost like she is trapped at the age she was when she started using drugs. Like she is a teenager, and at some point I moved past her and became an adult,"" said Danielle. Salzer says it's naive for women such as Danielle to believe their moms will ever just go away, but they can learn to negotiate and set limits. ""The whole notion that they will just get rid of their mothers doesn't work so well, because I know very few people who can do that, just shed their family or their history. ... Their parent is really impaired. The best you can hope for is that they can stop having the expectation that this will turn into something normal."" Danielle says she knows her mother's behavior is a danger sign, not something she should readily accept. She has cut off access to her passwords and no longer will give her money directly. She no longer trusts her, even thought she loves her. ""Who runs out in the middle of the night with someone else's debit card to get cash if they're not using drugs?"" she asked. ""I don't want to be helping her get in more trouble."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Soledad O'Brien.","Soledad O'Brien: Many young women struggle because mothers don't fulfill their role .

"(CNN) -- As awful as Louisville guard Kevin Ware's leg injury appeared during Sunday night's Elite Eight game against Duke, Ware could be back on the court in six months to a year, an orthopedic surgeon says. Fans across America averted their eyes in horror Sunday night as Ware, 20, came down wrong on his leg, causing a gruesome break. His right tibia, or shinbone, broke through the skin in what's called an open or compound fracture. Open fractures often cause damage to the surrounding muscles, tendons and ligaments, according to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. ""This type of fracture is particularly serious because once the skin is broken, infection both the wound and the bone can occur,"" the academy's website states. Ware was immediately taken to an Indianapolis hospital. In a two-hour surgery, his bone was reset and a rod inserted into his tibia, according to a statement from Kenneth Klein, senior associate athletic director for media relations at the University of Louisville. That's typical procedure for this kind of injury, says orthopedic surgeon Dr. Fred Azar of Memphis, who is not involved in Ware's care. After the wound is washed out, doctors address any tears in the surrounding tissue. Then a steel or titanium rod is placed inside the hollow leg bone to reconnect it where it broke. After surgery, Azar places his patients on antibiotics to lower the risk of infection. Although the fracture looked extraordinary, Azar says, he sees it all the time in his practice. Open fractures are usually the result of a ""high-energy"" trauma, according to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons website. Orthopedic surgeon Dr. Saul Kaplan of Springfield, Virginia, says Ware may have twisted his leg as he landed, causing the bone to snap. Kaplan -- who also is not involved in Ware's care -- said it's also possible Ware had a benign bone tumor that weakened the tibia before his fall. If there is no nerve damage, Kaplan says, doctors will probably get Ware up and moving the day after surgery. And with intensive daily physical therapy, he could be back on the basketball court in six months to a year. Of course, with serious injuries comes the risk of serious complications, according to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. The three most common complications for open fractures are infection, difficulty healing and a condition called acute compartment syndrome. That develops when pressure builds in the muscles surrounding the injury; it's painful and can cause tissue death if the pressure is not relieved, according to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons website. If Ware's leg doesn't heal properly, he may need more surgery. Before leaving the court Sunday night, Ware reportedly told his teammates to focus on winning. A photo posted on the Internet shows his jubilant teammates holding up Ware's jersey as they celebrate their win. Another showed Ware in his hospital bed, holding the trophy his teammates brought to him. ""Ware will remain in Indianapolis until at least Tuesday, when he is hopeful to return to Louisville and then join the Cardinals as they advance to the NCAA Final Four in Atlanta,"" Klein said. The Louisville Cardinals take on the Wichita State Shockers at 6:05 p.m. ET on Saturday.

"(CNN) -- It's one of the largest age gaps between presidential candidates in American history. Only 20 percent of those polled said Sen. John McCain's age would be a factor when they voted in November. Republican Sen. John McCain is 72, a skin cancer survivor, and would be the oldest man sworn in for a first term as president. His opponent, Democratic Sen. Barack Obama, is 47 and the fourth-youngest major party nominee. A new CNN/Opinion Research Corp. Poll finds that may be a political liability for McCain. Nearly half of the Americans surveyed, 47 percent, are concerned that McCain would not finish a four-year term as president in good health. To pre-empt those concerns, McCain has allowed reporters -- including CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta -- to look through more than 1,100 pages of his medical records. This spring, McCain's personal physician, Dr. John Eckstein, released a letter saying there is no medical reason ""that would preclude McCain from fulfilling all the duties and obligations of the president of the United States."" Still, the issue hasn't gone away in the minds of voters. In the CNN/Opinion Research Corp. Poll, conducted in late September, 29 percent of those polled said they are ""very concerned"" about McCain's ability to complete a first term; another 18 percent are ""somewhat concerned.""  Results: How important is health, age of candidates? » . That compares with just 8 percent who said they are ""very concerned"" about Obama's ability to finish his first term in good health and 11 percent who said they are ""somewhat concerned."" Obama has not released any medical records; however, his campaign released a statement from his doctor saying he is in ""excellent"" health. Both the Obama and McCain campaigns say they will not release any additional information or records about the candidates' health. Are voters more concerned about a presidential candidate's health or his age? In the poll, 20 percent of respondents said McCain's age would be a factor when they voted in November. ""McCain's age appears to be having the roughly the same effect that Ronald Reagan's age had in 1980,"" according to Keating Holland, CNN's polling director. ""Back then, when Reagan was 69 years old, concerns were raised about his age,"" Holland said. That obviously didn't prevent Reagan from winning, but then again, the election in 1980 election turned out not to be a particularly close one."" A candidate's health is far from the top of voters' concerns. Just 7 percent of those surveyed in the poll said it would be the ""single most important factor"" in their vote, and 24 percent said it would be ""one of several important factors"" they would consider. How concerned are voters about McCain's and Obama's medical histories? Of those polled, 33 percent said they would be concerned about the health of a candidate who once had cancer but no longer does; 14 percent said they would be concerned about the health of a former smoker. McCain quit smoking in 1980. Obama quit last year as he launched his presidential campaign but admits he's ""bummed"" cigarettes since then.   The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. Poll also included more hypothetical questions. Eighty-nine percent said they would worry about a candidate who was an alcoholic, and 47 percent said they'd be concerned about a recovered alcoholic. Still, some voters are hard to ruffle. Nearly one in four said they would be ""not very concerned"" or ""not concerned at all"" even if a candidate suffered a heart attack during the presidential campaign. The good news for McCain and Obama is that in this election, their health isn't nearly as important to voters as their plans for health care, the economy and the war in Iraq. But in a close race, anything could make the difference.","Poll: Nearly 47 percent of Americans concerned McCain wouldn't finish first term .

"(CNN) -- It sounds like a name-dropping marketer's dream: . Sean Parker -- the Napster co-creator who was played by Justin Timberlake in ""The Social Network"" -- creates a Facebook-connected app and gets celebrities like actress Olivia Munn, the rapper Snoop Dogg (they've got to be Facebook friends, right?) and Joel McHale, the guy from ""Community,"" to video chat on it. That was the scene in New York on Tuesday as Parker and Napster co-founder Shawn Fanning announced their new venture, a live video-chatting platform called Airtime. The problem? In the middle of this rich-rapper-plus-rich-Internet-tycoon gabfest, Airtime crashed. A lot. ""Glitch after glitch marred Airtime's first public showing, leaving the event's collection of celebrities riffing and improvising onstage while engineers tried to fix the bugs and revive dropped connections,"" CNNMoney's Laurie Segall wrote from the event. ""Airtime demo = Snoop, Jim Carrey, Ed Helms, Julia Louis Dreyfus, Joel McHale, Alicia Keys, Olivia Munn + a million tech problems,"" tweeted Abby Gardner, from Marie Claire. ""The Airtime has been about 80% fail, but, hey, Jim Carrey is here. So it's all good,"" wrote Mashable's editor-in-chief, Lance Ulanoff. CNET was harsher: ""To launch his new start-up, Sean Parker should have spent less of his billions on celebrity guests and more of it on fixing his technology,"" wrote Greg Sandoval. A botched demonstration, of course, doesn't mean that Airtime is doomed. But, based on reviews from tech writers, descriptions of the product and a quick test, there's something more troubling that could be bad news for Airtime's shelf life: . No one seems to know why people would use it. How Airtime works . Essentially, Airtime is a Facebook-connected, video-chatting platform on crack. When you log on at Airtime.com you see two video-chat windows, a list of your friends you might want to talk with and a list of topics you might want to talk about. If you select a topic -- like TV's ""Mad Men"" or other items you may have ""liked"" on Facebook -- you will get set up with a video chat with someone else who also likes that show. The same goes for location: You can have Airtime start a random conversation with someone who is on Facebook and who lives in your geographic area. It's like Skype, but you can watch YouTube clips with someone while you're engaged in a video chat together. Which makes it like Google+, except it's attached to a social network that has 900 million active users, giving it potentially more reach. If you're plugged into the tech world, you may recall a website called Chatroulette, which hooked people up with strangers online for quick, random video chats. That site got lots of buzz on this website and others, but it ultimately flopped because people stopped using it for cross-cultural ""We Are the World"" exchanges, and started getting naked. Because Airtime also lets people chat with strangers, it's been called the logical, safer successor to Chatroulette -- one with more clothes. Parker's chat program is tied to Facebook, so it knows your real identity and can ban you in a hurry if you show up for a video discussion sans pants. According to this Forbes report, the site will snap photos of users periodically to ensure that people have their clothes on. So that's how it works. But the question remains: Do Internet users really want to chat with strangers? And if not, is Airtime different enough from Skype -- a video-chat program that's already integrated into Facebook -- to stand out? Serendipity, or sleaze? Writing at the blog All Things D, Liz Gannes explains why the Napster alums think people will want to engage in video chats with people they don't know: . ""Parker and Fanning argue that they are helping bring serendipity into a world where people's online social graphs are set. Airtime is a 'social discovery' application for helping people make new friends online, not necessarily for the purpose of dating."" But, she writes, it's not certain if that's how people will use the network. ""It's unclear if Airtime will work -- will people want to use it?"" she asks. ""Will it fill up with spammers and skeezy dudes? Is it technically sound? But what is clear is that there are high expectations for Parker and Fanning's next act."" Sandoval, from CNET, was more direct: ""Cool technology or not, the demand for this kind of service has yet to emerge,"" he wrote. Others are more upbeat about the future of random video chats. ""The excitement of meeting new people with whom you have no 'friends' in common, only interests, geography or kinks, are probably enough (to propel the product),"" Anthony Wing Kosner wrote at Forbes.com. ""Parker told (Forbes writer Steven) Bertoni in an interview Sunday, 'Fun crazy things should happen online.' OK. Let the wild rumpus begin! (Once the technical glitches are worked out...)"" Wired, meanwhile, also sees potential in random video conferences between strangers, particularly because Airtime works to set you up with people who have common interests: . ""When a chat with a stranger is initiated, the service lists both users' shared interests. So, for example, if both users are huge 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' fans, they could both dive right into discussing the pros and cons of William Riker's beard. Interests can be added and removed from within the video chat window. This is perfect if your love of 'Twin Peaks' has connected you with people who are probably a little too obsessed with the death of Laura Palmer."" The blog TechCrunch goes so far as to say the program will ""re-humanize the Internet."" ""One minute into using Airtime I was laughing with someone I'd never met,"" writes Josh Constine. ""That's something special when despite all the asynchronous connection, the Internet threatens to make us feel lonely."" My time with Airtime . In my quick test of the network, I had a different experience. Whereas Chatroulette in its early, non-pornographic days felt fun and random, Airtime felt more stilted. It was almost intimidating to enter into chats on Airtime with strangers who were assumed to have something in common with you. That said, I did have a couple of good interactions. I talked to one guy about the E3 video-gaming conference going on this week. He seemed impressed with Airtime and said it is way better than Chatroulette. But I also chatted with someone who was supposed to be in my geographic area and wasn't. We didn't have much to talk about, so I started playing that mash-up YouTube video of Barack Obama singing ""Call Me Maybe."" The point, I'd hoped, was that this might give us something to talk about -- or at least we could sway together. Not so much. My 30-second friend hung up on me. If you go to Airtime.com and sign up, let us know what you think in the comments.","Napster co-founders Sean Parker, Shawn Fanning launch social video venture called Airtime .

"(CNN) -- Four U.N. peacekeepers were released Sunday, five days after they were seized by armed men while patrolling between Syria and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, an army official from the Philippines said. Maj. Ramon Zagala, a spokesman for the Philippine Armed Forces, said the Filipino peacekeepers were with the commander of that country's troops in the Golan Heights. ""Last week was a challenge and we are very thankful for their safe release,"" Zagala said. He said he could not provide an update on their health. They will return to Camp Ziouani, where doctors will examine them. According to the U.N. news website, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon released a statement thanking the government of Qatar for its role in the safe release of the hostages. The United Nations Disengagement Observer Force monitors the area in accordance with the 1974 agreement between Syria and Israel negotiated after the Yom Kippur War. In March, 22 peacekeepers were held for four days by rebels. The U.N. called on Syrian and rebel troops at that time to honor the impartiality of the U.N. troops. Tensions in the area have been heightened recently and Israel conducted strikes against Syria twice. The attacks, confirmed by a U.S. official last week, targeted a weapons storage site containing missiles and a Damascus research facility. The official stressed that Israel is concerned about Syria transferring weapons to the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.","The four had been held nearly a week after being seized by armed men .

"(CNN) -- ""A tragedy with a happy ending"" -- isn't that what we want? People generally concentrate on the happy ending part of that sentence, taking it for evidence of a taste for mass delusion or collective amnesia. The movies overwhelmingly give us happy endings. But too many give us happy beginnings and middles, too, as if we're incapable of enjoying the meat in a sandwich. David O. Russell keeps a smile on his face -- all six of his films could be called comedies -- but he doesn't shirk from the other part of the equation, either. He's touched on incest (""Spanking the Monkey""), adoption (""Flirting with Disaster""), the Gulf War (""Three Kings""), drug dependency (""The Fighter"" -- not exactly a comedy, but a film with as many laughs as most), and even existential despair (""I Heart Huckabees""). Putting the ""antic"" into ""romantic"", ""Silver Linings Playbook"", is a comedy about clinical depression. Cynics might roll their eyes -- me too, actually -- but the movie plays like a dream. It defeated ""Argo"" for the Audience Award at the Toronto Film Festival in September, the first harbinger of the Oscar season. In his most credible attempt to break out of the ""light leading man"" mantle (which is not to say he's all that credible), Bradley Cooper plays Pat, a New Jersey high school history teacher tipped off his bipolar axis after finding his wife showering with another faculty member. Released from the hospital after several months, he returns to live with his parents (Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver) and determined to win back the love of his life -- hopefully without encroaching on the restraining order. A blind date with his best friend's recently widowed and equally traumatized sister-in-law Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) furnishes the manically overoptimistic Pat with a co-conspirator, and, he hopes, a back channel to his ex. But Tiffany has her own agenda and her own needs -- including a dance partner for an upcoming competition. This last item would seem to be a sure recipe for the purest cinematic cheese, but Russell doesn't let it curdle. He's the ideal director to bring Matthew Quick's best-seller to the screen because he's too edgy to wallow. Just as ""The Fighter"" fended off punch drunk ""Rocky"" euphorics with a series of swift, cruel jabs, the brisk, eccentric ""Silver Linings Playbook"" resists settling into a feel-good groove. By keeping things rough and raw -- his scenes are always an inch or three off-kilter, a little jerky and unpredictable -- Russell makes the jokes feel sharper, and the sentiment that much sweeter. In other words, he reminds us that silver linings are precious because they come attached to great big black clouds. Nothing if not an actors' movie, ""Silver Linings"" provides De Niro with his juiciest comic role since the first ""Meet the Parents."" His socially sanctioned, but deeply superstitious, obsession with football is as wild as anything going on with his son. Weaver, the Australian actress who earned an Academy Awards supporting nomination for ""Animal Kingdom,"" is completely convincing as a loving wife and mom who's in over her head in this chaotic household. And Chris Tucker (yes, that Chris Tucker) is a hoot as Pat's certifiably insane, but scrupulously polite hospital buddy. Even then, the biggest takeaway has to be ""Hunger Games"" star Lawrence. She doesn't just hold her own, she absolutely bosses her scenes, De Niro and all. Does ""Silver Linings Playbook"" trivialize depression and mental illness? In the end, I think you have to say it sugarcoats those things. But a little positive thinking never hurts: See this one with a receptive crowd. Chances are you'll come out feeling better than when you went in.","""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a comedy about clinical depression .

"SAN DIEGO, California (CNN) -- Drug traffickers are throwing everything they've got at getting drugs into the United States any way they can. U.S. border agents discovered marijuana hidden inside a spool of industrial wire. At the San Ysidro crossing near the Mexican border, officials have found drugs smuggled in things such as tables, toys, furniture, holiday candles, even tennis shoes. ""Their bottom line is to make money, and they are going to do whatever they can to ensure that that happens,"" said Mike Unzueta, the special agent in charge for Immigration and Customs Enforcement in San Diego. ""They've become very, very creative."" Drugs also are brought in underground through tunnels; some 100 have been discovered since 1990 along the 1,950-mile U.S.-Mexico border. The most sophisticated tunnels have lights, air systems and hydraulics. While drugs flow north into the United States, weapons and cash flow south into Mexico. The smuggling organizations are well-established and sophisticated. They have a recognized hierarchy and employ the latest technology, said Rafael Reyes, chief of global enforcement operations for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.  Watch the creative techniques drug smugglers are using » . Border agents have found radios, cells phones and global positioning system tracking devices, leading officials to believe drug cartels positioned on or close to the border are in constant contact with drug runners. ""These guys are very ingenious,"" Reyes said. ""They will exploit any vulnerability that they can."" Reyes said that means factoring in the possibility a certain percentage of drugs will be seized by federal agents: ""They'll line up 10 loads, and if you pick off two or three, well, that's the cost of doing business, 'I got seven across.' So it's that shotgun mentality."" The same thinking applies to drugs smuggled in the waters of the eastern Pacific off the coasts of Central and South America. U.S. Coast Guard Capt. Vincent DeLaurentis and his crew on the cutter Hamilton came back from three months of searching for drugs inbound to Mexico. They covered an area of ocean about the size of the Southeastern United States. They captured six hard-to-detect boats that travel at night and seized 30,000 pounds of pure cocaine. DeLaurentis said drug traffickers have become much more aggressive in their smuggling tactics. Among the new trends, he said, ""They're using vessels that are less and less detectable, whether it's these go-fast boats that travel at night or the new self-propelled semi-submersible vessels.""    Click here for photos of the ways in which drugs are moved into the U.S. » . Known as SPSS, self-propelled semi-submersibles are something like submarines, but they cannot fully submerge. Anywhere from several inches to a couple of feet remain above the water line; they are painted a blue or gray for camouflage, and they are flat on top with valves and air holes. They are difficult to detect and have become increasingly sophisticated. Some can travel up to 5,000 miles and use fuel tanks for ballast. They can carry some seven to 10 tons of drugs, and because of their low profiles and low radar signatures, the vessels are popular, DeLaurentis said. The submersibles are built in the rebel-controlled jungles of Colombia, and the U.S. Coast Guard said cartels pay for construction. The craft rendezvous with fishing vessels or ""go-fasts"" -- boats that are typically 40 feet long, go 40 knots and can carry several tons of heroin or cocaine. The drugs then go to Mexico, where the cargo is offloaded and transported across the border into the U.S. ""The fact they're developing semi-subs that can carry huge amounts of drugs and running those vessels for thousands of miles tells me that it's a very sophisticated operation,"" said Capt. Tom Farris, commander of Coast Guard Sector San Diego. The Coast Guard tries to engage and board these vessels before they get to Mexico. But evidence of drug smuggling needed for prosecution is hard to come by --- because traffickers on these crafts easily can escape by opening a hatch, tossing out a life raft and then scuttling the vessel to the bottom of the ocean along with its cargo. A U.S. law signed in January makes it illegal to operate a stateless SPSS and will allow the Coast Guard to arrest people it used to have to release because drug evidence was on the bottom of the ocean. Mexico produces three out of the four major abused drugs in the United States -- marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines, according to the DEA. Cocaine, however, comes from South America, but it and the other three drugs are all shipped through Mexico into the United States. ""Mexico has become a vital hub,"" Reyes said. According to the DEA, 90 percent of all cocaine destined for the U.S. comes through the Mexican-Central American corridor, with 47 percent not stopping in Central America but going to Mexico. The primary transit routes from Mexico into the U.S. are: Tijuana to San Diego, Sonora to Phoenix, Arizona; Chihuahua to El Paso, Texas; and the states of Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas, which will cover the remaining south of the border, to the Texas cities of Laredo and Brownsville. ""Those are the principal lucrative corridors,"" Reyes said. They are ""controlled by separate organizations because of the market they have in the United States, and it is a profit-minded approach they take in securing these corridors for themselves."" The San Ysidro port of entry is the busiest border crossing with Mexico and the United States. More than 110,000 people pass through every day, making it fertile ground for drug cartels looking for new ways to ship drugs. Port Director Oscar Preciado oversees the San Ysidro crossing. On any given day, he said agents seize five to 10 loads -- about 50 to 500 pounds of marijuana, cocaine, heroin or methamphetamines. Recent seizures include marijuana in tires and heroin in phony  fuel tanks, some with secret levers. ""They'll put it anywhere they can, and they're very creative in creating their own compartments and concealing them,"" Preciado said. With border security tighter than ever, Preciado said drug traffickers are paying kids as young as 14 to smuggle dope -- mostly marijuana. Drug traffickers who frequently bribe Mexican police are now trying to bribe U.S. agents. While rare, officials said, it is serious. ""Corruption is one of our major concerns. We do everything we can to stop corruption,"" Preciado said. With billions of dollars at stake, cartels will try anything, officials said. ""If we can't catch the drugs, what we want to do is make them spend more resources in order to get the drugs across the border,"" said the Coast Guard's Farris.","Smuggling organizations use latest technology to move drugs into U.S., officials say .

"(CNN) -- A manufacturer of military-style rifles says it is leaving Connecticut and is encouraging other companies to do the same after last week's signing of sweeping gun legislation. PTR Industries of Bristol said the bill approved by the General Assembly was ""fraught with ambiguous definitions, insufficient considerations for the trade, conflicting mandates and disastrous consequences for the fundamental rights of the people of Connecticut."" In a statement, the company said it hopes to pick a site by summer and move by the end of the year. Gov. Dannel Malloy on Thursday signed what advocacy groups call the strongest and most comprehensive gun legislation in the nation. Compromise sets up likely U.S. Senate debate . The law bans some weapons as well as the sale or purchase of high-capacity magazines like those used in the Newtown, Connecticut, shooting in December that left 20 children and six adults dead. It also requires background checks for all gun purchases. The Connecticut measure adds more than 100 guns to the state's list of banned assault weapons, limits the capacity of ammunition magazines to 10 rounds and bans armor-piercing bullets. Connecticut governor signs sweeping gun measure . While the new law allows current owners of magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds to keep them, it requires those people to register the magazines with the state and forbids owners from loading them with more than 10 rounds outside their homes or while at a gun range. ""At any given time, we own 100,000 or more 20-round magazines,"" PTR Industries CEO Josh Fiorini told CNN affiliate WFSB. ""How are we supposed to individually register all of those magazines?"" No more gun sales where semiautomatic used in Sandy Hook shooting . With the restrictions and loss of sales, Fiorini said, his company will be unable to make payroll. John McNamara, vice president of sales, said PTR Industries has 42 employees. ""Indirectly, we employ 15 to 20 local vendors at any given time who have up to 15 to 30 employees each,"" he told CNN on Wednesday. All of the company's rifles are semiautomatic. PTR Industries sells its products to national distributors, and they are resold to federally licensed retailers across the country, said McNamara. McNamara said he did not have data on current sales in Connecticut, but he said the law makes the company's rifles illegal for sale or transfer within the state. ""Our governor has decided that he wants our business to stay here and sell the guns he feels deemed illegal to other states, but not our own,"" said McNamara. ""We do not agree with that logic."" Why is passing new gun control legislation so hard? Critics have argued the Connecticut legislation will do nothing to stop someone like Adam Lanza, who carried out the Sandy Hook school killings December 14 with an assault-style weapon and high-capacity magazines. ""In his case, he stole the guns and went on a murderous rampage,"" Scott Wilson, president of the Connecticut Citizens Defense League, previously has said. ""Limiting magazine capacity or mandating registration will only affect law-abiding persons, not criminals bent on murder."" Republican House Minority Leader Larry Cafero, a member of the bipartisan task force that drafted the bill, reassured gun owners they wouldn't lose their guns or ammunition magazines, ""so long as they follow our rules and register,"" he said. On Thursday, when he signed the gun law, Malloy said, ""We have come together in a way that relatively few places in our nation have demonstrated an ability to do."" However, he noted, ""Today does not mark the end of our efforts"" to combat gun violence. President Barack Obama has been waging a public pressure campaign for tougher gun laws. Background checks on gun sales: How do they work? PTR Industries said the safety of children was ""at best questionably improved"" since the shootings. ""Due to an improperly drafted bill, manufacturing of modern sporting rifles in the State of CT has been effectively outlawed,"" the company said in Tuesday's statement, adding it made the decision with ""heavy heart."" PTR Industries called on other gunmakers to leave Connecticut and ""show our politicians the true consequences of their hasty and uninformed actions."" In February, Mississippi House Speaker Philip Gunn invited gunmakers such as Colt's Manufacturing Co. to relocate to his state from Connecticut and elsewhere. Colt is based in West Hartford. The gun industry in Connecticut is being attacked and ""demonized"" because of national politics, Gunn said in a letter to Colt's CEO before the gun law's passage. U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, said Gunn sent letters to three gunmakers in his state and called Gunn's proposal ""preposterous."" Connecticut residents support the Second Amendment and responsible gun ownership, ""far from demonizing firearms products made here,"" Blumenthal said in a statement.

"(CNN) -- ""Thank you, Mr. President, you're not such a bad-looking guy yourself."" That would have been my response if I were California Attorney General Kamala Harris, who finds herself in the middle of a media dustup after President Obama introduced her as: ""by far the best-looking attorney general in the country,"" at a fundraiser earlier this week. Harris is a beautiful woman. She's also super intelligent and accomplished, which the president also noted. In fact, he lauded her professional merits first. So, I say take the compliment and move on. Or, if you're slightly embarrassed by the comment, give it back and move on. President Obama's observation is not a major offense to women around the globe. Ridiculous flaps such as this one have always made me uncomfortable with calling myself a feminist, especially if that means I have to fly into a fit each time a man makes an awkward comment about a woman. These were the president's exact words, according to a White House transcript from the fundraiser: . ""You have to be careful to, first of all, say she is brilliant and she is dedicated and she is tough, and she is exactly what you'd want in anybody who is administering the law, and making sure that everybody is getting a fair shake. She also happens to be by far the best-looking attorney general in the country â€” Kamala Harris is here. (Applause.) It's true. Come on. (Laughter.) And she is a great friend and has just been a great supporter for many, many years."" Opinion: Obama's 'best-looking' remark was sexist . Clearly, the president realized in hindsight that his comment didn't go over very well, and he has apologized. But I don't believe an apology was necessary. It's impossible to believe that anyone could seriously call President Obama a chauvinist over this banter between friends. No matter your politics, you will have a hard time finding a president who has included women more in his agenda. What has he done for us lately? Let me recall just a few things: . - Appointed two female Supreme Court justices, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor. - Appointed Hillary Clinton as secretary of state. - Signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which restored worker protections against pay discrimination. The bill had failed in the Senate in 2007. I have disagreed with the president at times, but if POTUS is sexist, then we need more men just like him; the world would be a much better place for women. In my book, when a person -- man or woman -- acknowledges someone's intellect and professionalism and then gives a lighthearted nod to her beauty, it's not sexist. It's just a compliment. Throughout my career, I've had to learn how to deal with men, and a few women, who made it a point to always comment on my looks, or tell jokes about women working in sports. Early in my career, I admit, I was uncomfortable and wondered how to best handle the situation, not easy when you are many times the only woman in the newsroom. But even when I started out, I realized that context is everything, especially in the workplace, when talking about women and harassment. Here's an example: One night, while I was working late in the office editing on deadline, a male co-worker stumbled into my cubicle in a drunken stupor, he slung himself on my desk and leaned into me, slurring: ""Roxanne, you're so beautiful. Seriously, I've been watching you. ... Why don't you pay attention to me?"" Now, that was creepy. And clearly it was sexual harassment. My bosses and the human resources department quickly dealt with the guy. In fact, his behavior was reported by a male colleague, who witnessed the entire thing, before I could even make the call. On another occasion, a senior executive speaking at an employee ""town hall"" meeting at work, pointed me out for a professional accomplishment, and then added: ""Hey, Roxanne looks like that woman on the show, 'The Next Top Model.' "" There was some laughter in the room but most of the women froze. I did not. I laughed and said: ""Thanks, I'm glad you like my new hairdo."" Sure, I knew immediately that the comment was a little awkward. But I was in no way offended. And I did not want the executive, who had always been a champion for women in the workplace, to get any backlash for his comment. He didn't deserve the criticism. Honestly, when he made that comment I was more worried that my female colleagues would be angry with me. Women might not want to admit this but we often hate women who look good, are smart and successful. Just think: Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook COO, or Marissa Meyer, Yahoo! CEO. Maybe we've been conditioned to believe the stereotypes. But none of us will achieve true equality in the workplace until we end this animus toward one another and focus on how to truly achieve power. Luckily, sometimes life isn't serious. Sometimes, we can laugh at ourselves and know that not every man is out to hold us down. And if we women are indeed confident in our abilities and our appearance -- no matter how we look on the outside -- then we should stop cowering every time a man notices us and makes a comment. Stand up strong and take the compliment, but just make sure you're handling your business, because beauty is nothing without brains to match. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roxanne Jones.","Roxanne Jones: Obama taking huge heat from comment that California AG is good looking .
Jones: Comment came after praise for accomplishments and was not sexist .
She says a comment in that context is a compliment; women should know the difference .

"(CNN) -- The man destined to become leader of the world's most populous nation will sit in the halls of power in Beijing, but a part of him remains in the American heartland. Xi Jinping's visit to the United States last February included expected stops in Washington and trade meetings in California. Even an NBA game. But the part Xi, 59, looked most forward to was an evening in Muscatine, Iowa. He wanted to visit ""old friends"" he'd met on a trip to Iowa almost 30 years ago. Rewind to a time when Mikhail Gorbachev was ascending to the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party, Terry Anderson was taken hostage in Lebanon and Tiananmen Square was just another place in Beijing. Xi arrived in Muscatine for two weeks in April 1985 with a Chinese delegation looking into farming technology. The next leader of the powerful communist state -- he is expected to take the helm early next year -- got a first-hand look at how American capitalists do agriculture. Doyle Tubandt, president of Muscatine Foods Corp., recalled how Xi discussed globalization, its scope then unimaginable to many Americans. As major Chinese leadership change begins, questions swirl . Tubandt marveled at today's global economy. His own company now exports food and pet products to China. Back then, he escorted Xi on a tour of a corn processing plant. At times, the language barrier was hard to overcome. How do you translate words such as centrifuge? Tubandt gestured heavily and drew drawings in the sand to explain things to his Chinese visitor. He kept a tin of black tea that Xi presented to him as a memento of the visit. After all these years, the tin is preserved half full. Tubandt was one of 14 people invited to a private dinner with Xi at the circa 1866 Victorian home of Sara Lande in February. They had all met Xi on his first trip. Then, Xi had dined on Iowa beef and corn. Lande decided to go up a notch on elegance for China's next leader. Her menu boasted tenderloin, spring rolls and bacon-wrapped scallops. ""You were the first group of Americans I came into contact with,"" Xi told his Iowa friends. ""To me, you are America."" Xi's visit was a big deal for Muscatine, a small eastern Iowa town known for farming, the largest Heinz plant outside of Pittsburgh and factories that used to spit out billions of mother-of-pearl buttons. That was before the refinement of plastic. As Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad put it: This is the biggest thing to hit Muscatine since Pope John Paul II's visit in 1979. Branstad, who also met Xi in 1985, was invited to the dinner hosted by Lande. ""We consider you a great friend of Iowa,"" Branstad told Xi, according to The Muscatine Journal. ""We are so appreciative you chose to come to Muscatine and to Iowa."" Xi also visited a farm near Maxwell, Iowa, in February, and while in the state, he and other Chinese officials signed a five-year cooperation deal with Washington on food security, food safety and sustainable agriculture. Three challenges for China's next leaders . Chris Steinbach, the Journal's former editor, told CNN that he had received thousands of e-mails from journalists around the world who were curious about Xi's visit. ""It's obviously a pretty big deal,"" Steinbach said. ""You never know what will come as a result of this kitchen-table diplomacy."" That kind of one-on-one relationship made an impression on Xi on his first trip to Iowa. ""When you get the opportunity to meet somebody in their home or in a private setting, you get to know them differently than at a state dinner,"" Steinbach said. ""Clearly that worked on Mr. Xi when he was here 27 years ago."" Now, as China's ruling Communist Party convenes its 18th National Congress, the world wonders what course the global power will chart under new leadership. What will the future bring for America's relationship with the Asian giant? In Iowa, some people know this: that sometimes, it pays to sit on a couch, in front of a blazing fire and build a bridge to friendship. And that even after Xi assumes China's top post, he will keep Muscatine close to his heart.","Xi Jinping visited Iowa in 1985 and returned earlier this year to Muscatine to visit ""old friends""

"(CNN) -- A month after a fire crippled a Carnival ship in the Gulf of Mexico, another one of the cruise line's vessels may be experiencing its own problems. Multiple passengers aboard the Carnival Dream have contacted CNN, telling stories of power outages and overflowing toilets, all while docked in port at Philipsburg, St. Maarten, in the eastern Caribbean. ""We are not allowed off of the boat despite the fact that we have no way to use the restrooms on board,"" Jonathan Evans of Reidsville, North Carolina, said in an e-mail early Thursday. ""The cruise director is giving passengers very limited information and tons of empty promises. What was supposed to take a hour has turned into 7+ hours."" The Dream was scheduled to leave port around 5 p.m. ET on Wednesday. Gregg Stark, who is traveling with his wife and two young children, told a similar story. ""There's human waste all over the floor in some of the bathrooms and they're overflowing -- and in the state rooms,"" he said. ""The elevators have not been working. They've been turning them on and off, on and off."" An announcement over the ship's public address system said they were trying to fix the problem and were working on the generators, according to Stark. A few hours later, another announcement was made, saying the problem was worse than expected. When told of the complaints, Carnival representative Vance Gulliksen said late Wednesday night he wasn't aware of a problem. Several subsequent calls to the cruise line went unanswered. The U.S. Coast Guard said there were no reports of an incident, adding cruise lines typically give a courtesy call even when they're experiencing minor problems. The Dream, which can carry more than 5,000 passengers and crew, sailed from Port Canaveral in Florida on Saturday. The reports are similar to those that came from the Carnival Triumph last month. An engine room fire left the cruise ship crippled and adrift in the Gulf of Mexico with more than 4,200 people aboard. The schedule four-day cruise stretched into eight days as tugs pulled the vessel into port. Food was scarce and passengers sweltered in the heat with no air conditioning. A class action lawsuit has been filed against Carnival Corporation in the aftermath.","The Carnival Dream is experiencing problems, passengers say .
