"Dr Nancy Snyderman apologized for violating an Ebola quarantine as she returned to NBC on Wednesday morning and insisted that 'good people make mistakes'. The NBC News medical correspondent appeared on the Today show for the first time in a month and apologized at length for her mistake before presenting a segment about depression. 'I'm very sorry for not only scaring my community and the country but adding to the confusion of the terms that came as fast and furious as the news about Ebola did,' she told Matt Lauer. 'We had already been taking our temperatures... and we knew our risks in our heads... but we did not really appreciate and - frankly were not sensitive to - how absolutely scared Americans were.' Scroll down for video . Apologetic: Dr Nancy Snyderman returned to the Today show on Wednesday after she violated her Ebola quarantine. She apologized for the mistake but said it mustn't distract people from the real story . Snyderman had been reporting on the Ebola outbreak in Liberia for NBC in October at the time a cameraman who briefly worked with her, Ashoka Mukpo, came down with the deadly virus. Mukpo was transferred back to the U.S. for treatment at a Nebraska medical facility and has since recovered. Snyderman and the rest of the NBC team were urged to voluntarily quarantine themselves for a 21-day period upon their return to the United States. But during the midst of that quarantine, Snyderman and her crew were spotted getting takeout food from a New Jersey restaurant, prompting New Jersey officials to make her quarantine mandatory. On the job: Dr Snyderman agreed to a voluntary quarantine for Ebola after covering the outbreak in Liberia for NBC, pictured - but she was seen getting takeout in New Jersey just a few days later . Neither she nor anyone else from the network came down with Ebola. Her takeout foray angered her bosses and unleashed a bitter response online, with some viewers saying that they would have a hard time trusting her again after the mistake in judgment. NBC News President Deborah Turness told Dr Snyderman to take some time off. On Wednesday, Snyderman explained: 'It was about breaking a promise and it was also my association with Ashoka Mukpo. 'Good people can make mistakes and I stepped outside the boundaries of what I promised to do and what the public expected of me, and for that I'm sorry.' But she also added that concern over her story had taken away from 'the real issue at hand' - the suffering she had seen of the virus across West Africa. Healthy: Snyderman and her team were quarantined after a crew member, Ashoka Mukpo (pictured center with his father and his girlfriend), was diagnosed with Ebola. He was sent back to the U.S. and has recovered . Snyderman, 62, will also report on a medical issue for NBC's Nightly News on Wednesday. There had been some question about whether the veteran medical journalist would ever return to NBC News. Snyderman, a surgeon, has been at NBC News since 2006 after spending 17 years as a medical correspondent for ABC News.","The NBC News medical correspondent had been reporting from Liberia in October when one of her cameramen, Ashoka Mukpo, got Ebola .

"With the EU voting on plans that would see all washing-up gloves rigorously tested — meaning prices will rise by 20 per cent — should you stock up on before it’s too late? Alice Smellie rolled up her sleeves to find out . . . THE ORIGINAL — AND BEST? Extra-life Kitchen Gloves by Marigold . Extra-life Kitchen Gloves by Marigold, £2.50, Ocado.com . THE GLOVE: Thick yellow latex, with roll-top cuffs. Cotton-lined for comfort. THE TEST: Rubber gloves were created in 1889 by a surgeon to protect the hands of medical staff, with the first Marigolds made in 1947 for domestic use. I road-test them on a two-day-old lasagne dish that is encrusted with burnt cheese and mince. Although the water is scaldingly hot, I don’t feel the heat and even use my rubber-covered fingers to chip away stubborn bits of food. BACTERIA BASHERS . Anti-Bac Gloves by Lakeland, £2.99, lakeland.co.uk . THE GLOVE: Certified to eliminate bacteria such as e-coli, salmonella, listeria and MRSA. Also recommended for skin that’s sensitive to latex or nitrile (a type of rubber). THE TEST: According to Allergy UK, 6 per cent of us have a rubber latex allergy. But adding an anti-bacterial element seems excessive. Surely you are protecting yourself from harmful bacteria by wearing a glove in the first place? But they fit well and unlike others, these aren’t too thick — my fingers easily pick up the smallest of teaspoons from the sink. A KILLER PAIR . Insulated Hot Food Gloves, £23.99, wayfair.co.uk . Insulated Hot Food Gloves, £23.99, wayfair.co.uk . THE GLOVE: Protects your hands when handling hot food. THE TEST: As well as being very expensive, these are thick, heavy and an ominous dark, shiny grey. My husband walks into the kitchen and asks: ‘Have you killed someone?’ — and they do look like something a criminal would wear to clean up a murder! I cook chicken nuggets to perform a heat test. I try to scoop them from the baking sheet, but have to concentrate jolly hard because the gloves are so padded with insulation that dexterity is limited. But I don’t sustain any heat-related injuries, which is the point (they only withstand temperatures of up to 120c, though). When washing up, you can’t feel hot water, but it’s tricky picking up small objects (or even plates for that matter). FAILS THE TEASPOON TEST . True Blues, The Ultimate Household Glove, £9.99, lakeland.co.uk . THE GLOVE: Thick and latex-free. Extremely resistant to strong household cleaners. THE TEST: A very thick glove, and they feel cumbersome on. They keep my hands safe in very hot water, but the loose fit means that it’s not very easy to pick up a teaspoon. They’re also machine washable. After cleaning the downstairs loo, I pop them in a wash with tea towels. The next morning, they still aren’t dry, however, so I’m not sure I’d recommend it. Power Force Rubber Gloves with Anti-Slip Grip, 59p, Aldi . REAL STINKERS . Power Force Rubber Gloves with Anti-Slip Grip, 59p, Aldi . THE GLOVE: Non-slip grip moulded in. THE TEST: Look and feel like the cheap option. My six-year-old says the inside ‘smells disgusting’. They’re much thinner than the others, and in hot water my hands are sticky and warm after a few minutes. I’d recommend more expensive gloves. SUPER SCOURERS . Bizzybee Scouring Gloves, £2.40, bizzybee.co.uk . THE GLOVE: One glove has a non-scratch scouring palm; the other is left plain for easy handling. THE TEST: I often make bacon sandwiches and hot chocolate on a Saturday morning. This means somebody (me) has to wash up a greasy pan and a milky pan afterwards. The gloves have scouring pads running up the fingers and over the top of the finger on the right hand so you can get to tricky corners. They are absolutely brilliant — except for left-handers. MOISTURISE WHILE YOU SCRUB! Bizzybee Multi-Purpose Gloves With Moisturiser, £3, bizzybee.co.uk . THE GLOVE: Latex free, with luxury lining. THE TEST: The inside is so soft it feels like you’re wearing cashmere (to clean the house — how posh!). They look elegant and are comfy, too, while my dexterity with them on is excellent. After washing up, the plates are sparkling and my hands are so soft it’s as if I had a housekeeper do the work for me. Marigold Extra-Tough Outdoor Gloves . CAR-WASH WONDERS . Marigold Extra-Tough Outdoor Gloves, £2.59, ocado.com . THE GLOVE: Heavy-duty rubber with extra-comfy cotton lining. THE TEST: I don’t really ‘do’ stuff outside, but I decide to wash my car, which is encrusted in mud. Sure enough, the heavy-duty rubber means my hands don’t get dried out from repeated dipping in the hot water. As an extra test, I tidy up a load of leaves with my hands, which is very easy in these gloves.","EU voting on plans would see all washing-up gloves rigorously tested .

"Temporary tattoos may be all the rage again thanks to Beyoncé - but it seems they're not just for humans. A new brand creates body art just for horses, helping transform equine friends into  My Little Ponies. The Glamourati stencilled designs claim to be ideal for the horse and rider who like to stand out from the crowd. Scroll down for video . Glittery tattoos for horses are brainchild of Sally Rees from Coventry, who took inspiration from the ancient tradition of quarter-marking. Designs are applied using stencils and last up to two weeks . The  stencils transform equine friends into My Little Ponies, like this My Little Pony Earth Horse Belle Stars toy from 1982, by Hasbro . Created by mother of two Sally Rees, 40, from Coventry, the temporary tattoos can last from a day to two weeks, depending on the glue used to apply them. The glue doesn't touch the horse's skin, so vets say it's safe to use and the tattoos can be washed off with soap, water and a brush. Sally, a former beauty spa director, came up with the idea for the sparkly marks while looking for a way to generate extra income after becoming a mother-of-two. She explains: 'I used to be the managing director of a beauty spa until 2009 when I gave it up to look after my two young children. 'I had been dabbling with different ideas to bring a bit more money in when I came across someone doing glitter tattoos at a craft fair. The Glamouratti stencilled designs claim to be ideal for the horse and rider who like to stand out from the crowd . A delighted little girl stands proudly by her glittery horse . Sally demonstrates how glitter is sponged onto the horse . 'My daughter fell in love with them straight away and so I started doing them at children's parties. 'About a year ago my in-laws from Ireland were visiting and knowing they have horses I just said: ""I don't know why no-one has made these for horses"". 'It was a light-bulb moment for me - the more I thought about it the more it seemed like a good idea. 'I started to look into it and realised there was a real gap in the market.' A year after her eureka moment, Sally has turned her idea into a fully-fledged business. She is now turning horses into real life My Little Ponies after inventing temporary tattoos for the animals made from glitter. The savvy 'horse beautician' has taken inspiration from the ancient tradition of quarter-marking. The art involves the hair on a horse's rear quarter being brushed into patterns for show. Sally has dubbed her venture 'quarter-marketing' - as brands can use the tattoos to stick their logos on the horses. Decoration: The temporary tattoos invented by Sally Rees can be applied to the horse's hair . Vet approved: The glue doesn't touch the horse's skin so it's safe to use and the tattoos can be washed off with soap, water and a brush . Different colourways suit different horses for dramatic effects . The tattoos are applied using a stencil to ensure a perfect picture, and Sally said the products have been popular with horse owners and have been approved by vets. She said: 'We spent a lot of time developing an adhesive that was long lasting but easily washed off. 'We then tried out our new products on some horses at our local riding school and they were an instant hit. 'Quarter-marketing': Brands can use the tattoos to stick their logos on the horses. Temporary: The pictures last a day or two weeks depending on the glue used . 'We then had a stall at a big horse show and we had queues of people waiting to get glitter tattoos on their horses. 'The glitter kits are completely safe to use - they have been given the thumbs up by vets. 'Glitter and sparkle is huge in the world of equestrian accessories and now the horses can have some too. 'When the sun comes out you can't describe how amazing the glitter tattoos look.'

"A company director has been found guilty of manslaughter after a steel worker was crushed to death during a £500,000 basement conversion at a £3.9million London townhouse. Conrad Sidebottom, commercial director of construction company Siday, was found guilty at Southwark Crown Court after employee Anghel Milosavlevici, 37, was killed by a falling wall during a property renovation. Mr Milosavlevici, a manual labourer, was killed in front of his father Gheorghe as the pair carried out refurbishment works at a £3.9million home in Fulham, south west London, in December 2010. Anghel Milosavlevici, 37 (left), was killed by a falling wall in front of his father Gheorghe (right) during a £500,000 basement renovation at a £3.9million townhouse in Fulham, south west London, in December 2010 . The court heard details of how the incident unfolded, including how Gheorghe shouted for his son to 'run' after noticing an unsupported load-bearing wall beginning to collapse. Mr Milosavlevici, from Walthamstow, was working in a trench at the time the wall fell, and it toppled onto him, leaving him trapped. Workers tried to dig him out as his father helplessly cradled his head while he lay unconscious. However, despite the emergency services arriving within minutes, Mr Milosavlevici tragically died at the scene. During the trial, the jury heard that had the trench walls been properly supported, the wall would not have collapsed and Mr Milosavlevici would not have died. He had been employed by Siday Construction Ltd to work on the basement renovation and the company was contracted to provide building services at the residential property, including the excavation of the basement and the underpinning of the supporting walls. The court heard how company boss Sidebottom visited the site two or three times a week but failed to improve the dangerous conditions for the workers. The 46-year-old, of Hertford, Hertfordshire, denied unlawfully killing Mr Milosavlevici by gross negligence but was found guilty by jurors at yesterday's hearing. Health and Safety consultant Richard Golding, 43, was also found guilty of failing to take reasonable care for the health and safety of others. Mr Milosavlevici was killed as he worked in the basement at the property in Fulham, London (pictured) Self-employed Golding was contracted to work on the project by Allday Safety Services Ltd but he failed to properly inspect the dangerous site, directly contributing to Mr Milosavlevici's death. The pair are due to be sentenced tomorrow. In a statement read outside court yesterday, Mr Milosavlevici's sister Cristina and fiancée Claudia described his death as a 'tragic loss'. 'He was the most gentle, kind-hearted and generous man you could ever hope to meet,' they said. 'He worked for Conrad Sidebottom for more than two years before he was killed, but we were shocked to hear evidence at the trial about how dangerous the site had become, and how little concern Sidebottom showed for the safety of everyone involved in the excavation works. 'We hope the verdict makes other construction company directors take stock of their own working practices, and ensure that they are doing everything possible to keep their workers safe.' The owners of the two-storey Victorian semi-detached home decided to renovate their property, at a cost of £576,000, in 2010. The first and second floors were to be refurbished, a new conservatory and kitchen added on the ground floor and a basement created. Workers were using the traditional method of underpinning to create the basement, by digging under sections of existing walls and deepening the foundations to make the new walls. Conrad Sidebottom, 46, commercial director of construction company Siday, was found guilty at Southwark Crown Court of manslaughter after failing to inspect and address the dangerous site conditions for workers . Trenches were excavated adjacent to exterior walls to allow workers to dig horizontally through the earth, underneath the walls of the house and replace with reinforced concrete. However, even though the work was dangerous and the design was changed, the underpinning of the £168,000 basement was not properly planned. Workers were left to their own devices to figure out how and when they would prop up trenches to stop them collapsing. Siday employee Bobby Risipitu told the trial he was never shown a method statement, plan or design and said workers were left to prop up trenches based on whether they felt safe. He said earth often collapsed on them when they were digging and large sections of the trench he was working in were not supported at all. Workers regularly discussed the dangerous conditions, jurors heard. Mr Milosavlevici's father said the gravelly earth was like digging with sand, with trenches often crumbling in on themselves. Mr Milosavlevici, a manual labourer from Walthamstow, died after being trapped by a falling wall as he worked in a trench during the renovations . The court also heard how just weeks before his death, Mr Milosavlevici suffered an electric shock after his shovel hit a live electricity cable that had not been cut off. Jurors also heard how, in what appeared to be a money-saving decision, excavated earth was used instead of sand to mix concrete. The post-mortem examination confirmed Mr Milosavlevici died of severe crush injuries to his chest and abdomen, several bilateral rib fractures and severe underlying injuries to the lungs. His heart, aorta and spleen were also damaged, consistent with crushing by masonry. Golding, who had the authority to stop dangerous works, inspected the site on October 26 and November 23, 2010, but never commented on the excavations. The safety document he drafted was also inadequate and not followed. In a police interview, he said he was shocked and insisted he had not seen the trenches which were hidden under boards. Sidebottom said he briefed workers and employee Patrick O'Connor who he believed was supervising the build. He told police that to the best of his knowledge nothing was wrong with the site and he took no steps to improve the site despite being aware of the dangerous conditions. Following the incident, a local authority building control officer found the house was potentially at danger of collapse. A dangerous structure notice was served and the property had to be stabilised by independent contractors. After the verdict, Detective Chief Inspector Tim Duffield, of the Met Police's homicide and major crime command, who worked closely the Health and Safety Executive, said: 'There was overwhelming evidence that Sidebottom and Golding's failure to carry out their respective roles directly resulted in the death of Anghel Milosavlevici. 'In this case the danger of collapse was not only foreseeable, it had been specifically identified by Golding in his risk assessments. 'Sadly, for Anghel's family this lapse would have tragic consequences and give rise to his untimely death.'","Conrad Sidebottom, 46, guilty of manslaughter at Southwark Crown Court .

"A nurse was brutally knifed to death in the street by her stalker ex-lover after she jilted him, a court heard. After the 'remorseless' attack on 42-year-old mum-of-two Naudel Turner, Dariusz Miakienko calmly made a phone call and rolled a cigarette as he waited for police to arrive. Married Miakienko, 47, began an affair with Mrs Turner after meeting her at the north London GP's surgery where she worked, the court heard. As the relationship petered out he became 'obsessive' and began stalking her when she began a new relationship with practice manager Kevin McDonald, Isleworth Crown Court were told. Dariusz Miakienko, 46, (right) is accused of killing Naudel Turner, 42, (left) in a savage knife attack in a Tottenham street which took place during broad daylight after their relationship ended . The jury heard her new lover even met Miakienko the day before the murder and warned Mrs Turner to call the police as he was 'dangerous.' When the 42-year-old left work Miakienko followed her before repeatedly stabbing her in the middle of a street in Bruce Grove on March 19 of this year, it was alleged. Peter Finnigan, prosecuting, told the jury of ten women and two men the murder took place just a short walk from where Mrs Turner worked as a practice nurse in Tottenham, north London. He said: 'The stabbing was methodic. It was extremely violent. It was remorseless and it was prolonged. When the 42-year-old victim left work, Miakienko followed her before repeatedly stabbing her in the middle of a street in Bruce Grove on March 19 of this year, it was alleged. 'About 1pm in the afternoon Naudel Turner left the Castle View Surgery, where she worked part-time as a practice nurse and walked a short distance to nearby Bruce Grove. 'As she was walking along the road she was seen to be followed along the road by this defendant.' At first Mrs Turner did not acknowledge she was being followed, but witnesses said she must of been aware of it as she turned around and confronted him. Mr Finnigan said: 'She was heard to shout to him 'leave me alone.' She then got her phone out and tried to make a phone call. The defendant grabs her arm and she turns around and slaps him.' Miakienko then pushed her against a fence and Mr Finnigan added: 'He attacked her with a kitchen knife, he stabbed her and she fell to the ground and he continued to stab her.' He said a passing motorist tried to intervene, adding: 'He pleaded with him to stop, shouting 'don't kill her.' Miakienko, of Lordship Lane, Tottenham, had denied one count of murder at Highbury Corner Magistrates Court . 'It didn't make any difference, he continued to stab her.' Then, after putting down the knife, he 'took out his own mobile phone and started to make a call, and one witness saw him then rolling a cigarette.' He was then restrained by passers-by, including an off-duty cop, until police arrived, the court heard. Paramedics rushed to the scene, but Mrs Turner died on the way to the hospital. Mr Finnigan said that Mrs Turner had lived with her husband, William, but they had become estranged in 2009. However she lived on the top floor of the house while her husband live on the bottom floor, and they would not discuss each other's personal relationships. Describing Miakienko and Mrs Turner's relationship, Mr Finnigan said: 'He had been in this country, it seems, for about five years. 'He had been treated as a patient at Castle View Surgery, where Naudel Turner worked and they formed a relationship, an intimate relationship.' She even helped her lover rent a flat in Lordship Lane, on the same street where she worked by paying his deposit and acting as his guarantor. Dariusz Miakienko had allegedly made a calm phone call and rolled a cigarette as he waited for police to arrive after the attack . Police later recovered texts and data from the man's phone after the murder which showed the relationship had soured and he had become obsessed with her. He said: 'Members of the jury, what you might think emerges, is that he become obsessed with her. The messages can be tender and loving, and they can also be seen to be increasingly possessive and controlling. 'He believed she would leave William Turner and marry him, in fact he had a wife and children himself in Poland.' 'As time passed, Naudel's interest for a continued relationship with the defendant seemed to have lessened. In fact she met another man, Kevin McDonald. 'It's obvious that the defendant had learned about her attraction to Kevin McDonald, and didn't like it, and was jealous about it. 'He started to pester Naudel with constant calls and texts. She started to discuss him to others as a stalker.' Mr McDonald had not known about Mrs Turner's relationship with the Pole at first, but after discovering it he had arranged to meet Miakienko. Afterwards Mr McDonald 'told her to call the police as he believed the defendant was possibly dangerous.' Silver-haired Miakienko was surrounded by three dock officers and was aided by a Polish interpreter. Miakienko, 47, of Lordship Lane, Tottenham, denies one count of murder. The trial continues.

"A California surgeon has been disciplined for removing the wrong kidney of a federal inmate and leaving him with the diseased one. The Orange County Register reported Tuesday  that the state medical board placed Dr. Charles Coonan Streit on probation for three years. The board said Streit, a urologist who has had his license for 41 years, relied on memory to decide which kidney to remove because he didn't have access to the patient's complete medical records. Diseased: Dr. Charles Coonan Streit has been placed on three years probation for removing the wrong kidney of a federal inmate leaving him with the diseased one . The 2012 operation at Fullerton's St. Jude Medical Center involved a 59-year-old federal inmate. The hospital was fined $100,000 because CT scans were left in an office on the day of the surgery. The inmate, who was serving time at Terminal Island, a low-security federal prison in San Pedro, underwent a second procedure to have the cancerous kidney removed. An attorney representing Streit didn't reply to a message seeking comment. The Register reports that Streit  has been barred from supervising physician assistants and is required to enroll in a wrong-site surgery course offered by the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine. Fined: Fullerton's St. Jude Medical Center was fined $100,000 because CT scans were left in an office on the day of the surgery . Patient: Nurses and an anesthesiologist who assisted Streit in the surgery told inspectors that the patient told them the wrong side when they asked him which kidney was diseased (stock image) The board described Streit's conduct as 'an extreme departure from the standard of care,' and listed the many aspects of standard operating protocol that would have prevented the error. Streit and his assistants could have postponed the surgery until the proper records were available and could have done a renal ultrasound to determine which kidney was tumorous.

"Pope Francis has 'sacked' the head of his Swiss Guard protection detail because the pontiff views the solider as being 'too strict'. Colonel Daniel Rudolf Anrig has been told by the Vatican that his contract will not be renewed on January 31, when it runs out. Pope Francis has been clearing out senior Vatican officials who do not share his modest outlook on life - including one cleric  dubbed 'The Bishop of Bling'. Pope Francis, centre, has sacked Colonel Daniel Rudolf Anrig, left, who was head of the Swiss Guard . Colonel Anrig, pictured, has been told his contract will not be renewed when it ends on January 31, 2015 . Vatican watchers said Pope Francis, pictured, thought 42-year-old Colonel Anrig was 'too strict' Franca Giansoldati, of Il Messaggero newspaper, told the Telegraph that the manner in which Colonel Anrig was informed of his sacking was quite unusual. He said: 'From what we journalists have been able to reconstruct, there is a different vision between the Pope who wants relationships inside the Vatican to be humane, brotherly, even paternally. 'And then, there is the vision of the Colonel who is the Colonel of the smallest army in the world, but it is still an army, with very rigid rules, very severe soldierly.' Pope Francis is believed to have been angered after he saw a young Swiss guard standing outside his papal suite all night. The pontiff is believed to have told the young man to sit down, and the solider replied that he could not as it was 'against orders'. Pope Francis responded by saying: 'I give the orders around here,' and went to buy the guard a cappuccino. Reports of the decision to remove Colonel Anrig were carried in the official Vatican Newspaper Osservatore Romano. Since Pope Francis' election, he has sacked his number two, Secretary of State Cardinal Bertone, three other members of the Commission of Cardinals, and the entire board of the financial watchdog. It is understood that Pope Francis was not impressed that Colonel Anrig had moved into a grand apartment over the Swiss Guard's barracks in the Vatican. Bishop Franz-Peter Tebartz-van Elst of Limburg, Germany, known as the Bishop of Bling was sacked earlier this year after spending £26million on a luxurious new residence and office complex while cutting staff. Pope Francis wants the corps to be run in a less military style, but Swiss guards found that the commander was too rigid, sources told agency ANSA. The 42-year-old father of four was previously head of the criminal branch of a Swiss police force, before he was appointed commander by Benedict XVI in 2006. He had previously served a Swiss guard in Rome from 1992 to 1994. The pope enjoys a familiar relationship with his bodyguards. He knows them by name and asks about their families. The corps are said to keep a glass that Francis drank out of when he stopped by their kitchens as a ‘relic’. Swiss Guards are the Swiss soldiers who have served as bodyguards of the Pope since the 16th century and are responsible for the security of the apostolic palace. They must be single Catholic men aged between 19 and 30, and at least 5ft 8.5ins tall. They swear allegiance to the Pope and are famous for their Renaissance-style uniform, with a plumed feather in their helmet, leggings and a high ruff collar.","Colonel Daniel Rudolf Anrig's contract is not being renewed by the Pope .

"Deep within our city sewers, a new breed of genetically mutated ‘super rats’, immune to poison, are spreading at alarming speeds. Scientists have now begun charting their rapid invasion into new communities by monitoring their progress in 17 counties in the UK. Genetic testing by Huddersfield University has revealed that the rodents have developed a mutation that allows them to survive conventional poisons. Scroll down for video . A new breed of genetically mutated 'super rats', immune to poison, are spreading at alarming speeds. This giant vermin was reportedly found in Gravesend, Kent . In counties such as Berkshire, Suffolk, Surrey, Wiltshire, Hampshire and Kent, all the rats tested were found to have immunity to poison. Places such as Shropshire and South Gloucestershire had slightly less resilient rats with immunity levels at 33 per cent, and 50 per cent respectively. Around 30 per cent of rats in Kingston are immune to poison, in Sheffield it is 40 per cent, while 75 per cent of rats in Southampton are immune. A . giant, 2ft (0.6 metres) long rat caught in Liverpool. A swarm of 'super rats' spotted across the country is expected to outnumber humans two to one by . next year . While the rats have been changing, humans have been using the same anticoagulant poisons since the 1950s. Research earlier this year found that the swarm of 'super rats' spotted across the country is expected to outnumber humans two-to-one by next year. For the very first time, the Tonight programme, which airs at 7.30pm BST on ITV, will show footage and images of these tested ‘super rats’. ‘I think people should be concerned about these resistant rats because of public health concerns - because they carry disease and various other bacteria and viruses,’ said researchers Dr Dougie Clarke. ‘They also damage buildings…they cost billions of pounds of damage worldwide.’ ‘With the use of rodenticides, that will kill off the normal rats, and then the resistant ones will remain. ‘So it’s a sort of time bomb of resistance building up over generations of rats.’ ‘The fact we've tested 17 counties and every single one of them has got resistant rats was an amazing find to us. We didn't expect to have every single county having resistant rats.’ While the rats have been changing, humans have been using the same anticoagulant poisons since the 1950s. This photo shows a huge rat that was caught in Cornwall earlier this year. It measured 50cm from tail to nose . Dr Clarke claims communities across the country are running out of defences as the government contemplates the future of rodenticide use. The most potent rat poisons are currently for professional use only and cannot be used outside without special license. The decision about the future regulation of rodent poison – mainly because of secondary poisoning to birds of prey and other animals - is expected this autumn. Dr Clarke explained how the costs of pest control will escalate as a result of these poison-tolerant rats. ‘Unless there's new legislation for the more toxic poisons and maybe for the more lax use of them, then it will have to be the more physical forms of killing the rats,’ he said. ‘The costs are going to escalate because of the monitoring and the picking off of the rats, and the dead bodies.’ Jack Russell Max, owned by Royal Tunbridge Wells resident Mark Willmott, caught one of the large rats whose numbers are increasing around the country. And the problem is not just confined to Britain. Other huge rodents have been caught recently in homes in Stockholm and Dublin . Scientists have now begun charting their rapid invasion into new communities by monitoring their progress in 17 counties in the UK. Pictured are the counties in which all the rats tested were immune to poison . Figures have revealed that, in some regions of the UK, the number of vermin has already surged by 50 per cent since April last year. And experts believe the rat population could soar from 80 million to 160 million by the end of the year. In April, a 2ft (0.6 metres) long rat was captured in Cornwall while other monster rats have been reported in Kent and in Liverpool. Rats thrive in damp and soggy weather - of which the UK has seen plenty during the wettest year on record. Vermin are also swapping rural areas for the big city. They can carry illnesses which can be passed to humans, including Weil’s disease, which has flu-like symptoms initially but can lead to jaundice and kidney failure. Across the country, councils have reported a rise in the number of rats being reported. Birmingham has the highest number of call-outs with 5,100 in the past year. And the problem is not just confined to Britain. Other huge rodents have been caught recently in homes in Stockholm and Dublin, where one rat was trapped by pest control after terrorising an Irish family in south Dublin. The Dublin-based 'monster vermin' had been terrorising Grace and Ian Walters’ home in Kingswood shortly after they moved into their new flat. Giant rats, the size of cows or even bigger, could one day fill a ‘significant chunk’ of Earth’s emptying ecospace. The terrifying scenario could become a reality as super-adaptable rats take advantage of larger mammals becoming extinct, an expert predicts. ‘Animals will evolve, over time, into whatever designs will enable them to survive and to produce offspring,’ said geologist Dr Jan Zalasiewicz, from the University of Leicester. For instance, in the Cretaceous Period, when the dinosaurs lived, there were mammals, but these were very small, rat and mouse-sized, because dinosaurs occupied the larger ecological nichesOnly once the dinosaurs were out of the way did these tiny mammals evolve into many different forms. ‘Given enough time, rats could probably grow to be at least as large as the capybara, the world’s largest rodent, that lives today, that can reach 80 kilos (17lb). ‘If the ecospace was sufficiently empty, then they could get larger still.’","Humans have been using the same rat poisons since the 1950s .

"The body of a woman who vanished nine weeks ago without shoes, money or her phone has been found in a Utah river five miles from her home. Kayelyn Louder, 30, had not been seen since September 27, when she was captured on surveillance camera leaving her Murray condo barefoot in the heavy rain. On Monday, workers inspecting drainage pipes in the Jordan River in West Valley City found her decomposed body partially submerged. She was identified by dental records on Tuesday. Her cause of death is still undetermined and authorities are not sure how she ended up in the river, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. A creek that leads to the river runs behind Louder's home but investigators believe the it was too shallow to carry her body five miles away, Fox13 reported. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Kayelyn Louder, 30, (pictured left and right) vanished from her home in Murray, Utah in September and her body has now been found in a river five miles away. Authorities do not yet know how it got there . In the hours before she went missing, Louder had contacted 911 to report a fight at a wedding and then an intruder in her apartment - although police found no evidence of either. She did not have any history of mental health issues although her father said she had experienced 'a little bit of depression' due to her recent employment status. 'She's been in and out of jobs for the last year,' Jesse Louder told KSL after her disappearance. Investigators have said that the surveillance footage shows her talking excitedly. It appears that her black Chinese pug Phyllis is in the video with her, but the dog was later found unharmed. After stepping out of the final frame of the footage, she was not seen again. Scene: Her body was found by workers inspecting pipes in the Jordan River in West Valley City, pictured . Heartbreaking: The discovery on Monday brings some closure to her family after nine weeks of searches . 'We don't know what happened,' Allen Robins, a private investigator for the Louder family, told Fox. 'No one else saw her. No one has any other details as to what had happened from when she left that frame until [Monday].' A roommate alerted authorities after she realized she had not heard from Louder, known as 'Kiki' to her friends, in a while. Following her disappearance, friends and family launched a massive search for the woman through social media and raised more than $8,000 online to help the efforts. Shortly after news that her body had been found, her family released a statement. 'We are broken hearted with the news of Kayelyn's body being found, but are also grateful to know where she is,' it said. Last sighting: She was captured on surveillance footage on September 27 but has not been seen since . Loved: She had no history of mental illness but it emerged that she called 911 multiple times about non-existent crimes in the hours before she vanished. Her father said she had been low about her job . 'This has been an extremely difficult 9+ weeks for all involved. We hope that through all of our efforts that she has been able to see how much she is loved and cared for. 'We are forever grateful to the volunteers who have helped us in countless ways over the past 9 weeks. We are amazed at your love and dedication to our family. 'While finding her brings some closure we still have many unanswered questions and will not rest until we are able to fully understand what happened.' A candlelight vigil will be held in remembrance of Kayelyn in Murray Park at 5.15pm on Thursday.

"A family has been left devastated following the death of their newborn baby  after she contracted a herpes virus from coming in contact with someone with a cold sore. Eloise Lampton, who was born healthily on November 1 via caesarean at Mackay Hospital in far north Queensland, died last week in the arms of her parents Sarah Pugh, 28, and Douglas Lampton, 35. The 24-day-old baby had been unknowingly infected with the herpes simplex virus while she was still in hospital in the days following her birth. Eloise Lampton, who was born healthily on November 1 via caesarean at Mackay Hospital in far north Queensland, died last week in the arms of her parents Sarah Pugh, 28, and Douglas Lampton, 35 . 'Doctors initially thought it was a feeding issue. When we came home she just wanted to sleep... she wasn't a crying baby,' Ms Pugh told Daily Mail Australia. But Eloise lost almost a kilo in the week after her birth and her health started to deteriorate quickly. She was taken to Brisbane's Mater Hospital and was placed on a machine to keep her alive as doctors scrambled to find out what was wrong. 'It all happened so quickly, like within hours. She was in the hospital and we thought she was fine, then that night we were told she might not survive the night,' Ms Pugh said. 'The machine fully took over her whole body. It went into her arteries to pump blood. It took over her organs to let her little body have a rest.

'Everyday we'd go in there and it was devastating to see her like that. It was heartbreaking. 'She was fully sedated but we'd touch her and she'd try and hold our hand. We'd have to put lip balm on her lips and she'd move them.' Doctors informed Eloise's parents, who have three other children, that it was the herpes virus causing their daughter's illness after two days on the machine. 'I was shocked. I was devastated to know she was born healthy and then this happened,' Ms Pugh said. 'They thought it could have come from me, but I didn't test positive to the disease. It was passed on through a cold sore. You have to be in contact – kissed or touched. We didn't have any visitors at hospital. It could have been from anyone.' Doctors informed Eloise's parents, who have three other children, that it was the herpes virus causing their daughter's illness after two days on the machine . Eloise caught a staph infection in her blood while she was hooked up to the machine and doctors informed her parents there was nothing more they could do . Eloise's parents held out hope their baby would recover, but when she caught a staph infection in her blood doctors said their was nothing more they could do. 'Eloise had a very large legion on her brain, her organs had shut down and they couldn't be sure how she would recover again,' Ms Pugh said. 'She fought right until the end. Five times in one week I was told she wouldn't have made it. Every time she would pull through. She defied the odds. She put up a very good fight.

"A Booker prize winning author has scooped his latest literary honour when he received the 2014 Bad Sex in Fiction prize. Ben Okri, beat the challenge of Wilbur Smith and BBC Newsnight's Kirsty Wark due to a single passage in his novel, The Age of Magic. The judges were impressed by the encounter between his character Lao and his girlfriend Mistletoe. Booker prize winning author Ben Okri, pictured, last night won a slightly less prestigious literary award when he beat off the challenge of the BBC's Kirsty Wark and Wilbur Smith to win the 2014 Bad Sex in Fiction prize . The passage read: 'When his hand brushed her nipple it tripped a switch and she came alight.' Later in the scene, Okri describes the characters as being 'adrift on warm currents, no longer of this world,' before ending the unfortunate passage with 'somewhere in the night a stray rocket went off'. In 1991 Okri won a more welcome literary prize when he was awarded the Booker prize for his novel The Famished Road. Commenting on his latest award, Okri said: 'A writer writes what they write and that's all there is to it.' His editor Maggie McKernan said: 'Winning the award is fun but a bit undignified, just like sex, assuming you do it properly.' The prize, organised by The Literary Review magazine, was handed over to Laura Palmer, the editorial director of his publishers Head Of Zeus, at a ceremony in central London. It was established in 1993 by critic Auberon Waugh to 'draw attention to poorly written, perfunctory or redundant passages of sexual description in modern fiction, and to discourage them'. Previous winners include Norman Mailer, Giles Coren and Melvyn Bragg.

"Struggling high streets received a boost after the Government announced a long-awaited review into punishing business rates. The rise in online shopping has been credited with the demise of the high street, with more than 100 shops closing down every week across the UK. Business rates, which are charged on bricks and mortar shops, have placed the high street at a further disadvantage to its online rivals. Around 100 shops close in the UK every week as business moves online, with industry leaders saying unfair rates have been an 'anchor' on growth in their sector (file . Now, the Chancellor has announced a review into the rates, which are based on the rental value of a building and which cost small business tens of thousands of pounds a year. Business groups said the way the tax was calculated was ‘outmoded, clunky and regressive’, and that it was an ‘anchor’ on growth and investment on the high street. George Osborne said he would also continue to cap the increase in business rates at 2 per cent, which is below RPI inflation. And for businesses whose rateable value – the annual rental value of the property – is below £50,000, an existing £1,500 discount on business rates will be extended for another year. Firms will pay no National Insurance for apprentices under the age of 25, Chancellor George Osborne announced yesterday. This means businesses will not pay the ‘jobs tax’ if they take on young workers and offer them employment and training. Ministers hope the move will help tackle youth unemployment, with a target of getting three million young people into apprenticeships by the end of the next Parliament. Nearly two million have taken up such posts since 2010 – a six-fold increase. The incentive for hiring apprentices will come into force in 2016, and is expected to cost £105million in the first year. It will apply to all earnings up to the 40p tax rate of around £42,000. This maximum is to discourage firms from calling highly-paid workers ‘apprentices’ as a way of avoiding tax. Employers pay NI at a rate of 13.8 per cent on staff earnings. In last year’s Autumn Statement, Mr Osborne announced businesses would no longer have to pay National Insurance for any workers under the age of 21 – rules which will come into force from April next year. In a boost for small businesses looking for loans, the Chancellor also extended the Funding for Lending scheme until 2016. Banks will receive up to £500million at cheap rates in return for lending to small firms. The moves were praised by shops, pubs, cafes and restaurants, although many expressed disappointment that the findings for the review would not be presented until 2016. Simon Tivey, of PricewaterhouseCoopers, said: ‘The extension of the tax relief will be welcome but I think waiting another year for any major changes to business rates will be disappointing for many. ‘The business rates system has been unchanged since 1988 and, in its current form, there are lots of elements which are starting to grate. It is well overdue for an upgrade.’ While shops pay high business rates for premises in central areas and high footfall, companies such as Amazon – which has a huge warehouse in South Wales, where land is cheaper – pay much lower rates. There are also anomalies in the system which leave some large retailers and department stores paying less than smaller businesses for their high street stores. Last year, the Mail reported that a fashion boutique in Rochdale had been forced out of its shop by sky-high business rates that saw it charged more per square metre than Harrods. Critics also claim that because the current rateable values are based on 2008 rental prices – at the peak of the property market – they are no longer applicable to some areas of the UK which are still recovering from the economic crisis. Stuart Adam, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said: ‘The fact that bricks and mortar businesses are based in high-value, high-tax areas, while online retailers do not need such a physical presence, does penalise the high street. ‘The business rates system is badly designed and there is lots of room for improvement.’ John Longworth, of the British Chambers of Commerce, added: ‘Businesses will be encouraged by the Government’s continued efforts to curb business rate increases. Shops in busier areas with high footfall generally pay higher rates, but anomalies mean that one fashion boutique in Rochdale was paying more per square foot than Harrods (file image) 'Firms will also be pleased to hear the Chancellor announce a review into the future structure of Britain’s business rates system. ‘This iniquitous tax is the highest in Europe and a drag anchor on investment and growth.’ A study of 500 town centres across Britain showed 3,000 outlets closed in the first six months of this year, while 2,600 opened. According to the Valuation Office Agency, business rates raised £20.5billion last year. The money is used to help pay for local services, such as police and firefighters. Emily Davies . Julie Deane, who founded the Cambridge Satchel Company, welcomed George Osborne’s decision to review the structure of business rates and his invitation for business groups to contribute to discussions. The 47-year-old sells brightly coloured leather satchels – popular with stars such as singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor and model Alexa Chung – from four British stores and says that a big selling point for her brand is that they are manufactured in the UK. But she added that selling from the UK meant she faced pressure from competitors abroad and online who did not have to pay the same business rates and thus were able to keep costs down. Julie Deane, founder of Cambridge Satchel Company, says high business rates penalise UK manufacturers . Mrs Deane said: ‘George Osborne said there would be a review of business rates overall and I think that’s a good idea. ‘I’m really hoping to see more investment in UK manufacturing and not penalising people with business rates. 'What it means when our overheads are so very, very out of kilter with other countries is that it stagnates our potential for growth.’ The business has a factory in Leicestershire and each day makes more than 1,000 satchels to be sold in more than 100 countries. The former stay-at-home mother said the freeze in business rates at 2 per cent will help her firm, which has a turnover of £13million and employs 120 staff, but she would appreciate more measures to help medium-sized businesses as well as smaller ones. ‘It’s great that there’s so much support for small businesses,’ she said. ‘But there’s also problems associated with being in the middle ground, as we are. ‘Scale-up businesses could contribute one million new jobs to the economy by 2034, so I just hope that we can get the support we need too.’","Business leader have branded rates an 'anchor' to growth on high street .

"Warnings that the 'Umbrella Movement' pro-democracy protests could devastate tourism in Hong Kong appear to be unfounded as the country saw a substantial rise in  visitors in October. The uprising against the Beijing government's stalling of open elections for Hong Kong has led thousands of residents holding protests in the region - which have led to violent clashes with police. However, despite the ongoing tensions, the Hong Kong Tourism board has reported a 12.6 per cent rise in tourist numbers for October 2014 compared to the same month last year. A group of Occupy Central demonstrators hold signs outside the Central Police Station in Sheung Wan, Hong Kong - but tourists are not been put off visiting . A cardboard cut-out of Chinese President Xi Jinping (centre) carrying a yellow umbrella is seen at the pro-democracy movement's main protest site in the Admiralty district of Hong Kong . And, according to statistics, the greatest increase in numbers concerns visitors from mainland China - with an 18.3 per cent increase. Beijing banned tour group visas for Chinese visitors to Hong Kong for a week due to protests and coverage of the instability has been censored, however figures for Chinese visitorshave still increased. Chinese tourists have also been keen to view the pro-democracy art and take selfies in the area. The huge increase of Chinese visitors has offset a slight decrease in the numbers travelling over to Hong Kong from the Americas, Australia and Europe. A woman carrying an umbrella is seen at the pro-democracy movement's main protest site - despite the ongoing troubles, tourism has increased . Added to this, there was also a 7.1 per cent increase in South Korean and Japanese visitors.

"George Osborne energised the housing market yesterday by dramatically overhauling the hated stamp duty system . George Osborne energised the housing market yesterday by dramatically overhauling the hated stamp duty system. Delighting his party and wrongfooting Labour, he made buying a home thousands of pounds cheaper for 98 per cent of families. Analysts predicted the Chancellor’s move – which takes effect today – will push property prices up almost a third by 2020. His announcement in the Autumn Statement put the aspirations of homeowners at the centre of next year’s general election campaign. And it echoed his conference speech in 2007 when he bamboozled Gordon Brown’s Labour government by saying he would raise the inheritance tax threshold to £1million. The Chancellor also offered relief for professionals paying the 40p higher rate of income tax, went after banks and tax-dodging multinationals and promised £2billion a year more for the NHS. He laid out plans for further spending cuts that economists say will shrink the state to its smallest size in 80 years. By 2019/20, public spending will be 35.2 per cent of national income, down from 40.5 per cent now. Mr Osborne hailed the fastest economic growth in the advanced world – telling MPs that 1,000 jobs are created every day. The UK is expanding two-and-a-half times faster than Germany and seven times the rate of socialist-ruled France. But he was forced to admit that the budget deficit is coming down too slowly and tax receipts are lower than expected, meaning more years of austerity lie ahead. The Office for Budget Responsibility says the stamp duty reforms will lift property values and transactions except at the top end of the market, where the tax will be higher. The independent agency has raised its forecasts for house prices – predicting they will soar 31.4 per cent between now and the start of 2020. With the general election only five months away, Mr Osborne’s mini-budget was packed with crowd-pleasing measures and traps for Labour, including: . It was the dramatic and unexpected reform of stamp duty, however, which electrified Westminster. As well as appealing to crucial swing voters in Middle England, it was designed to scupper Labour’s plans to levy a mansion tax on properties worth more than £2million. The Chancellor said stamp duty had become a ‘badly-designed tax on aspiration’ – and he prompted turmoil in the housing market by announcing that his changes would take effect at midnight. It means stamp duty will no longer jump dramatically at certain thresholds but will rise gradually through five bands. Analysts predicted the Chancellor’s move – which takes effect today – will push property prices up almost a third by 2020 . Mr Osborne said: ‘It’s a fair, workable, lasting reform to the taxation of housing. Today we back aspiration – the aspiration to save, to work and to own your own home. ‘It is in stark contrast to those who would hit people’s pensions and jobs and homes with higher taxes. That is an approach we entirely reject. ‘Instead we support people who want to work hard and get on – and it is for their sakes that we resolve to stay on course to prosperity.’ Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said Labour would deal with the country’s challenges more fairly than Mr Osborne had. ‘People are worse off and the fact is he has failed to balance the books in this parliament,’ he said. Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable broke Coalition ranks, questioning the Chancellor’s plans to cut the deficit in the next parliament with ‘brutal’ spending cuts rather than tax rises.","Analysts predict move will push property prices up almost a third by 2020 .

"Whisper any mention of Medinah. Forget any notion of Brookline. Only a miracle or a meltdown on the scale of those occasions in 2012 and 1999 can stop Europe now. Captain Paul McGinley’s team repelled everything the visitors threw at them during a magnificent US fightback in the morning to win the afternoon foursomes 3½-½ and move to the brink of victory . A four-point lead — the same as the US held at Medinah and Europe had at Brookline — heading into Sunday's singles is a scenario McGinley could only have dreamed about on Thursday. Europe had won only two of the previous 11 series in foursomes and fourballs.

Europe's Lee Westwood plays his approach shot towards the eighth green during their foursomes win on Saturday afternoon . Here they won two more — they never lost a single foursomes match in two sessions — and, with the greater strength in depth and so many proven competitors, it would be a shock of monumental proportions for them not to finish the job off now. So many fabulous performances, but Justin Rose has undoubtedly been the European man of the tournament so far. He was brilliant by any standard in the morning as he and Henrik Stenson won a match laden with a record number of birdies to become the first European pair to win their first three games since Lee Westwood and Sergio Garcia in 2002. Stenson had a tight back and so sat out the afternoon. In came Martin Kaymer, with the pair up against the wonderful American rookies, Patrick Reed and Jordan Spieth. What a nerve-wracking occasion this proved. Europe's Justin Rose celebrates with fans at the end of day two after halving his match and ensuring his team's four-point leading going into the final day .

Rose shows what half a point means with a fist pump and a raise of his club to the gallery after draining his putt on the 18th hole . Kaymer missed three putts inside 10ft during a four-hole stretch from the 13th. Reed missed from barely 3ft at the 16th. In the end, with four tired players on view, it was wholly appropriate that proceedings on this truly fabulous day should all come down to Rose on the final green. A 6ft putt for a half to leave Europe so close. Well, you can guess what happened next, can’t you? Lee Westwood and Jamie Donaldson’s foursomes victory over Zach Johnson and Matt Kuchar allowed the Englishman to celebrate a cherished milestone. That point, his 23rd achieved over nine Ryder Cup appearances, meant he went past none other than Seve Ballesteros on the all-time list. One more point today from the singles would see him go past Colin Montgomerie and draw level with Bernhard Langer, leaving him looking up at only Sir Nick Faldo on 25 points. That tells you everything about what a fantastic Ryder Cup player he is and why McGinley gave him a wild card.

Westwood won his 23rd Ryder Cup point in nine appearances to move ahead of Europe legend Seve Ballesteros on the all-time list . Westwood gets down low to help Europe team-mate Donaldson line up a  putt on the ninth green . There were some eyebrows raised, given the decision left Luke Donald on the outside, but even the doubters would surely have to admit now that they were wrong. In two foursomes matches the Englishman and the Welshman were a combined nine under par and had just two bogeys. That’s tremendous golf by any standards. Equally good were Graeme McDowell and Victor Dubuisson. McGinley deserves great credit for taking Westwood and McDowell to one side and assigning these two rookies to them. Both the senior men gave the debutants an ideal platform to show off their skills and how they seized it. ‘Make no mistake, Victor is the next superstar of European golf,’ said G-Mac. ‘He is the best partner I have had since Rory McIlroy, and that’s saying something.’ And how about Donaldson, making his debut at the age of 38 and mustering two points from three matches. Graeme McDowell and Victor Dubuisson were big winners for Europe with a 5&4 result over US pair Jimmy Walker and Rickie Fowler . Dubuisson watches on as McDowell putts on their way to victory on day two at Gleneagles . McDowell rates his team-mate highly: ‘Victor is the next superstar of European golf. He is the best partner I have had since Rory McIlroy, and that’s saying something’ Alongside Americans Spieth, Reed and Jimmy Walker, the rookies in this Ryder Cup have been immense. The other European success came from world No 3 Sergio Garcia and world No 1 McIlroy, registering their first full point and with some fine golf as well. Everything was set up for a morning of good scoring, from the fourballs format to benign weather to faster greens, and trust the top players from the two continents to oblige. A slew of scoring records fell and immense credit has to go to the Americans, who showed lots of heart following their disappointing afternoon on Friday, when they collected just half a point. It says everything that all four American pairs were at least eight under, a formidable standard. Inevitably, Rose and Stenson took the plaudits but there were some gutsy performances from those wearing stars and stripes. Veteran Jim Furyk and Hunter Mahan contributed with the former finally beating Westwood at the Ryder Cup at the eighth time of asking. These two have played in every Ryder Cup since 1997. Reed and Spieth were brilliant again in demolishing Thomas Bjorn and Kaymer and then came the late heroics from McIlroy and Ian Poulter against Rickie Fowler and Walker. Poulter’s nerveless play came too late to earn him an afternoon match alongside his old mate Rose — the pairings had to be in at 12.30pm. Mr Ryder Cup showed up at 12.35pm but it surely left him full of confidence for today. Not surprisingly, American captain Tom Watson retained faith in three of his four pairings for the fourballs but Europe’s players are so competitively strong it’s hard to take them out twice in the same day. And so the momentum shifted, just as it had on day one. The champagne’s on ice and 50,000 people will descend on Gleneagles today thinking only of heroes to acclaim. But Medinah remains a fresh memory, and the Ryder Cup’s reputation for drama unrivalled. There’s still work to be done.

"A Crufts trophy winner who was permanently banned from keeping dogs after inspectors found more than 90 animals living in 'despicable conditions' has moved to Scotland where she will be able to own pets again. Wendy Hutcheson, 62, who clinched second place in the yearling bitch category at Crufts in 2007 with an American cocker spaniel, kept animals in squalor at Audenshaw Dogs and Cats home near Manchester. She was found guilty of causing unnecessary suffering and failing to meet the needs of her animals and was also handed a lifetime ban on keeping animals in England and Wales following a court case in October 2010. Scroll down for video . Wendy Hutcheson, 62, was  banned from keeping animals after she kept more than 90 pets in squalid conditions - but she has now  moved to Scotland where she is able to keep pets due to a legal loophole . But Ms Hutcheson could now dodge the ban because of a legal loophole which means the prohibition order was not extended to Scotland. The woman - who now uses the name Boyle - has already been reported to the Scottish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SSPCA) by concerned dog lovers who claims she is seen with the dog on a daily basis. A spokesman for the SSPCA confirmed it had investigated the claims but is satisfied that the dog is owned by Ms Hutcheson's relative. But a spokesman for the RSPCA, which successfully applied for the ban, said Ms Hutcheson would not be flouting the ban by keeping an animal because it does not apply in Scotland. They said: 'Provision was made during the formation of the Animal Welfare Act under section 46 that banning orders would cover Scotland, as well as England and Wales. 'However, this section was never implemented at the time the Act was passed, and so that means the ban does not apply to Scotland.' This is one of the neglected dogs found at the pets' home in Manchester which was owned by the former Crufts trophy winner . When inspectors arrived at Ms Hutcheson's property, the RSPCA seized 63 dogs, 25 cats, two rabbits and two birds. More than a third of the dogs needed to be sedated to be 'de-matted'. In one case the matting accounted for more than a quarter of the dog's original weight. Each dog took two veterinary nurses an average of three hours to de-mat. Many had breathing problems caused by the 'overpowering' stench. One dog's eye was so badly infected it had to be removed – another lost 26 teeth. Most of the cats had ear mites and fleas, and two had feline Aids, the RSPCA said. Animals were emaciated and their coats were caked with urine and faeces from being kept in cramped cages and pens which had not been cleaned for 'weeks if not months'. RSPCA inspector Vicki McDonald said after the case: 'I've never seen as many animals living in such horrendous conditions in all my time working for the RSPCA. 'I hope the sentence will ensure no further animals suffer because of Ms Hutcheson.' Hutcheson now lives in a quiet part of Inverness a few hundred yards from her elderly and frail stepmother, Marion Calder. Eye witnesses have seen her with a poodle in her car, going in and out of her house and her relative's property. There is also a dogbed in the back of her blue Ford Ka and various dog and cat ornaments on her doorstep. She refused to comment on the lifetime ban or even confirm there was one in place. Inspectors found animals emaciated, while their coats were caked with urine and faeces from being kept in cramped cages which the court heard had not been cleaned for 'weeks if not months' At first, she also denied she had a dog, but then said: 'That is my stepmother's dog.' But one eye-witness and dog lover Jodie Foster said: 'I am visiting my mother on a daily basis and see this woman almost every day, going from her house to her stepmum's house with the dog. 'She stays a little while and then leaves with the dog. 'She can't be going to the vet every day. There is no doubt in my mind she is keeping the dog. 'This has been happening for around six months now. 'What is the point of a lifetime ban if she is still allowed to be near animals.' Scottish SPCA Chief Inspector Iain Allan said: 'We have received complaints relating to a woman residing in Inverness who is allegedly breaching a ban on owning animals which was imposed in England. 'After investigating it is our understanding that the dog does not belong to her. 'The woman advised she has been transporting the dog to and from the vets for her mother as she is unable to, and we have confirmed this with the vet. 'We are satisfied the dog is being well looked after and have no concerns at this stage. We will continue to monitor the situation.'","Wendy Hutcheson was the runner-up in yearling bitch category in 2007 .

"For years, all Butch the Boston Terrier knew was a life of roaming the streets, rifling through trash cans in the hope of finding a meal. But for one week, he got to experience unwavering love thanks to Alicia Buzbee and her daughter Kansas, who found him in Pinson, Alabama and threw him a party before he was put to sleep. As a puppy, the terrier had an owner and a home but, after a couple of years, the owner cast the dog out and he was left to live in the streets, AL.com reported. He lived off scraps and found shelter from the frost, but a week before Thanksgiving, Buzbee and her daughter discovered him lying in a front yard, struggling to breathe. Scroll down for video . Loved: Alicia Buzbee and her daughter Kansas found Butch, a homeless and dying Boston terrier, the week before Thanksgiving and lavished him with attention for a few days until he had to be put down . Celebration: They threw Butch a 'farewell' party where he met Santa Paws and opened gifts . Joy: The pup, who had been abandoned by his owner years ago, dons a cute hat for his party . They took him to a veterinarian at the Birmingham Boston Terrier Rescue and learned that he had almost no lung capacity, his trachea was leaking and his heart was swollen. The vet suggested he be scheduled for a 'humane euthanasia' and the women planned a final hurrah for the dog. For a few blissful days over Thanksgiving, he feasted on burgers and pumpkin pie, enjoyed playing with new toys and relished in the attention from his temporary owners. Then they threw him an early Christmas 'going away' party, where he sat on Santa's lap and donned a party hat as he opened more gifts. Care: The dog, who had a swollen heart, experienced more love in his last few days than he did in his life . Treats: Butch, pictured with Kansas and friends left, took trips to PetSmart for new toys and treats . At home: Butch, pictured grinning with Kansas, showed marked improvement during his few days of joy . The Buzbees noticed that Butch perked up after all the attention and was no longer struggling to breathe, so the trip to the vet was put off. But a few days later, his condition worsened again. 'Before he goes, I want him to look into my eyes, and I want to look into his eyes, and I want to whisper, ""I love you"",'  she told AL.com. 'I want him to hear those words and to see those faces of the people who love him.' Last Saturday, she carried out her wish and put Butch down with her family by their sides. She said that she was overjoyed that she could bring a few days of joy to the abandoned pup and that she saw him become hopeful in that final week. 'The heart can do so many things when it gets what it needs,' she said. Dog days: Butch took a turn for the worse at the end of last week and was put down on Saturday .","Alicia Buzbee and her daughter found Butch struggling to breathe in a yard in Pinson, Alabama the week before Thanksgiving .

"A mother was killed on the pavement in front of her husband and two-year-old son after a pensioner ploughed into her in his Mercedes because he mistook the accelerator pedal for the brake. Geoffrey Lederman, 83, killed Desreen Brooks and almost crashed into the whole family as he ploughed into a wall and mounted a pavement in West Hampstead in north London at 50mph. The pensioner had been driving home from a bridge game when he realised he had lost control of the powerful 3.8 litre V8 engine Mercedes and deliberately steered it into a garden wall in a bid to stop it, Blackfriars Crown Court heard. But Lederman had failed to spot there were pedestrians on the pavement. He clipped the toddler's pushchair before he crashed into Mrs Brooks, 33, who was killed. Desreen Brooks, 33, was walking home with husband Ben Brooks-Dutton (left) in West Hampstead when she was hit by a mercedes driven by Geoffrey Lederman, 83, who had lost control of the car and appeared to have confused the brake and accelerator pedals as he steered it into a garden wall at 50mph in a bid to stop it . The powerful classic car also hit a young woman who suffered brain damage and lost an eye. Lederman has been accused of causing death by dangerous driving and grievous bodily harm, which he denies. The court heard Mrs Brooks had been walking home with her husband, Ben Brooks-Dutton, the boss of Mischief PR, and their son Jackson from a friend's house at the time of the accident in November 2012. Witnesses described seeing Lederman's car 'screaming' along the lane, amid a cloud of smoke before it hurtled along the footpath in West End Lane at speed. Lederman ploughed into Mrs Brooks, 33, and also struck 23-year-old American student Amy Werner, who was left with permanent brain damage. Lederman, who had impaired eyesight and had previously suffered a stroke, floored the powerful car and didn't brake once before hitting the women, the court heard. Tom Kark QC, prosecuting, said: 'Over a period of just under 20 seconds it seems he accidentally put his foot on the accelerator instead of the brake. 'The car was very powerful and when he realised his car was out of control, not understanding why, Mr Lederman deliberately steered it onto the pavement and into the front garden wall of a house.' Widower Ben Brooks-Dutton arrived at Blackfriars Crown Court for the trial of Geoffrey Lederman . Jurors were shown CCTV footage of the blue Mercedes travelling at high speed before crossing onto the wrong side of the road, onto the path and into the women, at around 8.30pm. Mr Kark added: 'The first was Desreen Brooks who was walking down the road with her husband and two-year-old who was in a pushchair. 'The car scraped the pushchair but struck Mrs Brooks killing her. 'The car continued on its journey and struck a young American student named Amy Werner and she was severely injured. 'She suffered brain injuries and lost sight in one eye.' Lederman had spent the day at a bridge conference in Barnet, north London, before setting off for his west London home. He suffered minor injuries in the crash and had to be cut from the wreckage of his automatic Mercedes 380SL. Tests showed he had not been drinking and had a clean driver's licence. Investigators also found no mechanical faults with the car which he had bought second-hand in 1982. Mr Kark said: 'There is no evidence to suggest that vehicle defects caused or contributed to the accident and neither victim caused or contributed to the collision in any way.' Moments before the crash he had stopped to check his car after 'nudging' a pizza delivery man before carrying on his way, the court heard. Mr Kark said: 'He said he lost control soon after that, within seconds he seemed to be on the wrong side of the road going at almost racing car speed. 'He was tugging on the handbrake with no effect.' In the minutes before the crash Lederman's Mercedes was seen revving loudly for up to ten seconds as it sat stationary outside West Hampstead Underground Station. Lederman deliberately steered his Mercedes into a garden wall, but failed to see pedestrians on the pavement . The pensioner crashed into the wall at 50mph and may have confused accelerator and brake, the court heard . Investigators found he had mistakenly kept his foot on the car's accelerator when he thought it was the brake before careering off, the court heard. London Underground staff told police that they had heard a 'loud crunching sound' seconds before. Unlike modern automatic cars, the classic Mercedes did not require the brake to be pressed before engaging drive. Mr Kark said: 'It may be that when Geoffery Lederman engaged the drive gear when he believed he was pressing the brake or hadn't realised the car had slipped into neutral.' Richard Savours, a bridge partner of Geoffrey Lederman, told the court he found Mr Brooks-Dutton standing over his wife, Desreen, who was lying on the pavement, as she shouted for help. Mr Savours had taken part in a six hour bridge tournament with Lederman in Barnet when he overtook them on the pavement in his classic Mercedes. He told the court: 'I heard a scraping noise. The car overtook us on the right hand side and was on the pavement scraping along walls of gardens, which is what the noise was. 'Coming up to junction with Dynham Road, the car went over the junction, crashed into a wall and came to a stop. 'My wife stopped the car as the car went past us. 'I got out of the car and immediately saw a man standing directly opposite where I was standing shouting 'Please help us, won't somebody help me?' 'I first thought he was hurt and then I saw a woman lying on the pavement and he was standing over her. She was lying completely still. My first thought was she might be dead. Paramedics in a passing ambulance then got out to help and Mr Savours said it was impossible to get Lederman out of the car by the door as the handle had been sheered off by scraping along the wall. Lederman claimed he felt 'fine' throughout the day and had undergone an eye test in April 2012, adding that he didn't think he had to wear glasses as a condition of his licence but wore a contact lens in his left eye. He said he 'saw a gap' where he could crash the car and had not seen any pedestrians, believing he had 'done the right thing'. He told police he hadn't suffered any 'medical episode' that day and there is no evidence of a medical cause, the court heard. Mr Kark said lawyers acting for Lederman were expected to claim he had suffered 'some sort of seizure' before the accident. Lederman, of Maida Vale, who has been excused from attending the trial on health grounds, denies causing death by dangerous driving and grievous bodily harm. The trial continues.

"Chancellor George Osborne (pictured) has announced another purge on so called 'death taxes' Widows will be able to inherit their partner’s Isa without paying a penny in income tax, the Chancellor has announced. In a further purge on so-called ‘death taxes’, widows or widowers will be able to save nearly £500 a year on a £60,000 nest-egg that has been inherited. George Osborne also confirmed that spouses of deceased partners who receive payments from an inherited annuity won’t have to pay any tax from next April. Every year, anyone aged over 16 can save tax-free in a cash Independent Savings Account. The annual allowance is currently £15,000, and set to rise to £15,240 next April. But some 150,000 married savers die each year with an Isa which is passed to a spouse or civil partner, government figures show. When this happens they stop being an Isa – so interest earned on them is taxed. Someone who has built up more than £60,000 in a cash Isa earning 2 per cent would normally earn £1,200 interest tax-free. But outside an Isa, a basic-rate taxpayer would have to pay £240 tax a year on this interest; and a higher-rate taxpayer £480. ‘This restriction was a source of deep frustration and extra cost for grieving spouses,’ said Danny Cox, chartered financial planner at Hargreaves Lansdown wealth manager. ‘It’s good news for couples as most manage their money jointly, and the loss of the tax-free status on the cash has often come as a shock to the surviving spouse.’ The Chancellor said this brought Isa savings in line with reforms on pensions. Changes to the rules on Isas will give another boost to their surging popularity. Scroll down for video . In July, in a bid to boost savings in a climate of low-interest rates, the limit for tax-free savings was ‘supercharged’ by the Chancellor – and lifted from £11,880 to £15,000. However, the amount allowed to be saved in cash had previously been limited to £5,940. The new flexibility introduced from July 1 allowed savers to put the whole £15,000 allowance in cash. Savers can now also switch money between cash and shares; before the summer, you could only switch from cash into shares. Since being launched in 1999, Isas have helped encourage millions to put money aside for emergency savings – as well as boost their income in retirement. Roy Hamilton (pictured right) will be able to pass on the full worth of his pension to his wife Julie (left) if he dies before the age of 75 . Roy Hamilton will be able to pass on the full worth of his pension to his wife if he dies before the age of 75. The 65-year-old former council worker, from Bristol, has taken out a joint life annuity on his £75,000 pension pot with the help of advisers Hargreaves Lansdown. His 59-year-old wife Julie, a seamstress, is still in work but will be able to take 100 per cent of his pension without it being taxed after his death. The latest changes level out the playing field after the Budget in March allowed pensioners to take lump sums from their pension pots tax-free, but left those with an annuity worse off. Mr Hamilton, a grandfather of two, said: ‘The reason I took out an annuity is I like the idea of a regular payment. I took out a joint annuity to look after my wife, and she’ll get 100 per cent of that after I’m gone.’ Some 23 million investors and savers have £443billion in Isas. This is roughly equally split between cash and shares. The retirement shakeup means if a loved one dies before the age of 75, the surviving spouse won’t pay any tax on an inherited joint annuity. The Treasury is also to change tax rules to allow a joint annuity to be passed on to any beneficiary. The Chancellor’s announcement on joint annuities marks the latest in a long line of radical pension reforms started in his March Budget. From next April, there will be no need to buy an annuity. Those aged 55 or over will be able to dip into their pension whenever they want. Each time they withdraw cash, 25 per cent will be tax-free. However, they will have to pay income tax at their usual rate on the rest. The reforms also mean they will be able to leave pension cash in their will without the 55 per cent death tax, by paying into a so-called drawdown scheme. The Chancellor embarked on the reforms to stop savers being locked in to annuities that can be poor value or unsuitable for their lifestyle. An extra £2billion will be poured into the health service every year to relieve the pressure on hospitals. Mr Osborne said he had found the money from budget surpluses in other departments. Health chiefs had warned ministers that they faced an immediate funding gap due an ageing population, expensive new drugs and a rising bill for staff pensions. In addition to the £2billion for frontline services, Mr Osborne announced another £1.1billion for struggling GP practices over the next five years . It will be to funded by bank fines. Simon Stevens, the new head of the NHS in England, welcomed the cash injection. He has warned that the NHS faces a funding black hole of at least £8billion by the year 2020. The future of the NHS is expected to be a key battleground for May’s general election. David Cameron has already promised to protect its budget from cuts if he wins. Decaying churches could be restored to their former glory with the help of a new £15million fund for repairs. George Osborne announced that the Cathedral Renovation Fund will now be extended to cover repairs to all of Britain’s churches. It is hoped that the new money will help rescue the hundreds of church buildings which have fallen prey to thieves – who have been targeting the valuable lead in their roofs. Church leaders of all denominations will be able to apply for grants of between £10,000 and £100,000 in order to fund any repairs which are deemed to be urgent. Last month more than 800 churches were listed on English Heritage’s ‘at risk’ list because they had fallen into severe disrepair. The Bishop of Worcester, the Rt Revd Dr John Inge, said that the grant would make a ‘real and lasting difference’ to parishes. He added: ‘A secure roof can last 100 years and will prevent gradual, and ultimately costly, decay of fabric.’ Exposing the hidden mortgage fees . The Government is to probe baffling mortgage fees which make it hard for homebuyers to get the cheapest deal. Trade body the Council of Mortgage Lenders has been asked to work with consumer campaign group Which? to put an end to hidden house buying fees, it was revealed in yesterday’s Autumn Statement. Research by Which? has found that buyers can face more than 40 different layers of hidden fees when they buy a home. These include added extras such as fees for bank transfers, references and insurance. Charges run on through the life of a mortgage and can even be added at the end of a loan term. Because of fee confusion, just 3 per cent of buyers tested by Which? were able to correctly rank five deals in order of best value. The CML has now been told to make charges more transparent so that consumers can compare the total cost of mortgage deals. Paul Smee, director general at the CML, said: ‘Consumers need to be able to understand and compare products confidently. We welcome the opportunity to work with Which? towards measures that can make this easier for them.’ Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘With so many people on tight budgets trying to get a foot on the housing ladder or looking to remortgage as rates rise, it’s essential that they can more easily find the best deal.’ Any measures will be introduced in time for April’s Budget. From April, households paying a care worker up to £22,500 a year will not have to pay NI contributions. Stock picture used . Families who employ a carer will benefit from a National Insurance cut worth up to £2,000 a year. From April, households paying a care worker up to £22,500 a year will not have to pay NI contributions. The Chancellor has extended the Employment Allowance – a perk already available to charities and some small businesses – to ‘help with the employment of carers who do so much’. Emily Holzhausen, director of policy at the charity Carers UK, welcomed the move, saying it would help those relying on carers to buy more help or cope with pressure on their finances. She said: ‘This measure goes some way to reducing the cost of paying for care for families but more needs to be done to bring down the overall costs of care. There are 1.4million people providing more than 50 hours’ unpaid care for loved ones every week. ‘For those who do not qualify for social care services, the costs of care are high… many continue without much-needed care services until they reach breaking point.’","Widows will be able to inherit their partner's Isa without paying income tax .

"Eight families who lost loved ones in the Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 disaster when it was shot out of the sky in rebel-controlled eastern Ukraine are preparing to sue Russia, Ukraine and Malaysia. The Boeing 777 was travelling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur on July 17 when it was downed, killing all 298 people on board, including 38 Australian citizens and residents. It is not known which of the families are suing, however News.com.au reports they are from five different states across Australia and will also take action against Malaysia Airlines. Aviation lawyer Jerry Skinner, who is based in Alaska, has taken up their case and is preparing to lodge it at the European Court of Human Rights. Scroll down for video . Flowers laid out on the wreckage of MH17 in eastern Ukraine after the tragic disaster in July . Back in July the lawyer first told the Sydney Morning Herald that he could potentially achieve million dollar payouts for the MH17 victims’ families, like he had obtained from Libya for the families of the 1988 Lockerbie disaster. 'Something creative is going to have to be done here because this is too big and too complicated for the judicial system to handle on its own and it involves people who will not yield to the judicial system, such as the Russians and the Ukrainians,' he said. ‘What happened in Lockerbie was that politics got involved and sanctions got involved and we said to the Libyans, if you want to settle this, it doesn't matter what the individuals did [for a living]. ‘The parties that are the main participants here are probably the Russians and their allies and also Malaysia Airlines. Both of them bear a lot of responsibility for this.’ Mo, 12 (left), Evie, 10 (right) and Otis, 8 (centre) are believed to be some of the MH17 victims whose bodies were returned to Australia in October. It is not known which families are suing . The Boeing 777 was travelling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur on 17 July when it was downed . Now, Mr Skinner has said he will file a ‘very broad’ claim against Russia, Ukraine, Malaysia and Malaysia Airlines as soon as he gets some final information from the Dutch Safety Board. The airline has already promised to pay compensation out to the victims’ families and is liable to pay about $180,000 for each person killed. Amongst the Australian victims of MH17 were the three Maslin children, whose bodies finally arrived back on Australian soil in October. The bodies of Mo, 12, Evie, 10 and Otis, 8, were returned to their loved ones in Perth after arriving on board an RAAF Globemaster transport plane in Melbourne. They are believed to have arrived alongside a number of other victims of the tragedy. Families of the deceased were seen waiting at Melbourne airport as the plane arrived and watched as the coffins were removed from the plane. NSW resident Sister Philomene Tiernan (left) was killed while on board MH17 . A firefighter sprays water to extinguish a fire, on July 17, 2014, amongst the wreckages of the Malaysian airliner carrying 295 people . In July, the parents of the three Maslin children released a statement addressed to 'the soldiers in the Ukraine, the politicians, the media, our friends and family'. Anthony Maslin and Marite Norris wrote: 'Our pain is intense and relentless. We live in a hell beyond hell. 'Our babies are not here with us – we need to live with this act of horror, every day and every moment for the rest of our lives. 'No one deserves what we are going through. Not even the people who shot our whole family out of the sky.' Sons, daughters, couples, parents and grandparents were all among the people who never made it home to Australia after the tragic disaster. A much-loved nun from Sydney's St Mary Magdalene's Church, Sister Philomene, was on board the flight making her way home to Sydney after a sabbatical in France. Emma Bell (right), originally of Lithgow in NSW, was a passionate teacher who was returning from a trip to Europe to start the new school term in Arnhem Land, Northern Territory. Jack O'Brien (left) of Sydney, was 25. His family said he was 'loved so much' Mr Horder and his wife Susan, both 63, of Albany Creek, were among the Queenslanders aboard flight MH17 when it was shot down . Shaliza Dewal (left), 45, and her Dutch husband Hans Van Den Hende (centre) were travelling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur with their three children, Piers, 15, (top right) and Marnix, 12, (top back) and daughter Margaux, 8, (top centre) Emma Bell, who was in her 20s, worked with Aboriginal children in a remote Northern Territory community and was spending the school holidays in Europe before boarding MH17 in Amsterdam. She was returning to the Northern Territory for the new term. A 25-year-old, Sydney man named Jack O’Brien, was flying back home after enjoying a 'fantastic seven-week holiday in Europe'. And just one of the couples on board was Queenslanders Howard Horder and his wife Susan, both 63, of Albany Creek. They were returning from a trip to Europe after retiring. In Germany, a mother of a passenger who died in the MH17 crash is already suing the Ukrainian authorities for 'negligent homicide' and £650,000 in the European Court of Human Rights. The German woman, whose daughter - named as 'Olga L' - was killed when the Malaysia Airlines plane, began legal proceedings in the past week. She is seeking compensation from the authorities after Ukraine failed to close its airspace to civil air traffic because of fighting with pro-Russian separatists, it has been reported. Ukraine’s President Petro Poroshenko is visiting Australia next week and is expected to discuss the security situation in eastern Ukraine and its impact on international relations, as well as the links between Australia and his country.","Lawyer Jerry Skinner will lodge their case at the European Court of Human Rights .

"Three people were arrested after police attended a student sit-in at Warwick University. West Midlands Police said that they were responding to an alleged assault on a university staff member. A video which was posted on YouTube but has now been made private, shows police dragging a protester to the floor, and the sound of a Taser can be heard. A tweet from the West Midlands Police account said a Taser 'was drawn but not deployed. The sound is a warning sound'. Scroll down for video . Police drew a Taser when they attended a student sit-in at Warwick University. Three people were arrested after an alleged assault on university staff - but students say the response was 'disproportionate'. Above, a still from a video of the struggle . A video which was posted on YouTube but has now been made private, shows police dragging a protester to the floor, and the sound of a Taser can be heard . In another video an officer appears to tell protesters to 'back off or you'll get CSed'. Protesters can be seen being dragged onto the floor and physically removed from the building. The group, Warwick For Free Education, said that they were staging a peaceful sit in at Warwick University's Senate House in protest at rising tuition fees and high wages for university management. However, a spokesman for Warwick University, which is based in Coventry, said that university security staff who were supervising the sit-in were subject to a 'shocking and unprovoked act of violence' which forced them to call in police. A spokesman for Warwick University said that university security staff who were supervising the sit-in were subject to a 'shocking and unprovoked act of violence' which forced them to call in police . A statement on the Warwick Free Education website alleges that activists were 'punched, pushed onto the floor, dragged, rammed by their throat into the wall and kneed in the face. 'At least 20 students were assaulted by university security and police.' A student at the protest told the Coventry Telegraph: 'A police officer took out his CS spray and sprayed it in one person's eyes and then into a crowd of about ten people. 'A Taser was taken out and was being made to crackle by pressing the trigger, but it wasn't used. 'It felt particularly disproportionate. When the police came they didn't say why they were there. 'A lot of younger students were visibly shaken and left in tears. It was quite a shock, especially considering that it was a quiet protest - we weren't even shouting.' A spokesman for West Midlands Police said: 'Police were called to reports of an assault at the University of Warwick Central Campus in Coventry this afternoon. 'Officers arrived at Senate House at 4.50pm to find a group of around 25 students protesting about fees and a staff member reported that he had been assaulted by one of the group. 'Three people were arrested from the site, one on suspicion of assault and two others on suspicion of obstructing police. 'Police officers and security staff from the university worked together to ensure everyone was safe. 'The protest continues and officers remain at the scene to ensure there is no further breach of the peace.' Shortly before 9pm West Midlands Police posted two tweets on its official @wmpolice account, saying: 'The protest at the University of Warwick Central Campus remains on-going. Three people have been arrested following reports of an assault. 'During the disorder a Taser was drawn and an audible and visible warning was issued to prevent further incidents. The Taser was not fired.' But a statement from Warwick Students' Union said the force used by officers was 'disproportionate'. It said: 'This afternoon, a group were demonstrating for Free Education and entered the lobby of Senate House. The police arrived and an altercation took place, the full facts of which we are still in the process of establishing. Three people were arrested. 'From the footage we have seen of this incident, we absolutely believe that disproportionate force was used against protesters. We stand in solidarity with the Warwick students who were unnecessarily harmed in this action. 'The Sabbatical Team will be attending the peaceful demonstration happening on Thursday at 3.30pm. We will also update students further with a full statement tomorrow.'","Students were staging a sit-in at Warwick University in Coventry .

"Lewis Hamilton is living his American dream, with rap star friends, the celebrity Los Angeles girlfriend and a giant bling necklace. And the championship leader, who is mobbed in Austin, has even spoken about the possibility of raising a family on this side of the Atlantic. 'I enjoy it here, it's pretty cool,' he said. 'New York is a cool place to live. I was in Knoxville [Tennessee] the other day. It's beautiful, by the lake. But there is too much fast food.

Hamilton, 29, trains in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado and regularly travels from his home in Monaco to LA to see Nicole Scherzinger, his pop star girlfriend. A friend of rappers, he is keen on the music industry - an interest he could now actively look to develop into a business opportunity having just parted company with Simon Fuller's XIX management stable.

"Winter finally arrived in parts of Britain yesterday, threatening to put a chill in the tail of the hottest year for more than 350 years. Widespread frosts gave the landscape a Christmas card look while temperatures are forecast to plunge as low as minus 6C (21F) overnight on Saturday, with snow on high ground. But even as the cold spell began, 2014’s topsy-turvy weather had nature in a spin with cherry trees in blossom, frogs already spawning and daffodils in bloom several months early, while many of the summer’s roses are still in bloom. Blanket of white: A heavy frost at dawn on the River Brathay in the Lake District yesterday, but 2014 has seen the warmest average temperatures since records began . Chilly: Temperatures will slump as low as -6C overnight on Saturday following on from -5C last night, making it the coldest of the year so far . Frosty fields: Despite this wintery scene this morning forecasters say that 2014 is on track to be the warmest since records began in 1659 . Retired office worker Marilyn Fenn was stunned to spot a daffodil blooming in her garden this week, three months early. T . he 62-year-old widow, of Woodhall Spa, Lincolnshire, said: ‘It looks so lonely, I actually feel a bit sorry for it. 'I don’t know how long it will last with the cold weather.’ Records show that the year is set to be the warmest since records began in 1659. The Met Office said average temperatures from the beginning of January to late November were 1.6C (2.9F) above the long-term norm. The figures are based on Central England Temperature data. It has recorded monthly temperatures across an area between Lancaster, Bristol and London since 1659. For the whole UK, 2014 is the warmest in records dating back to 1910. The year’s crazy weather saw the wettest winter to strike southern England since records began in 1766, with severe flooding in Somerset, Kent and the Thames Valley suffering extreme flooding. Temperatures then hit 19C (66F) in the South in March, when the average is 9C (48F). A July heatwave roared in, with temperatures in the mid-30s (over 90F), but it was swiftly followed by the coolest August for 21 years as the remnants of Hurricane Bertha crossed the Atlantic bringing with it downpours and flash floods – just in time to catch the school holidays. After this, the driest-ever September preceded the warmest Halloween on record. Experts say that while a bitterly cold December could still knock 2014 off its top spot in the list of warmest years, this is unlikely. While all months except August have seen above average temperatures, no single month has seen a record-breaking high. Instead the year has been consistently warm. Can't make its mind up: This year has seen a July heatwave followed by the coolest August for 21 years and then the driest September ever . Don't jinx it: Meteorologists say that a bitter December cold snap could stop 2014 being the hottest year on record, but this is unlikely . Feeling the cold: While all months except August have seen above average temperatures, no single month has seen a record-breaking high . Across the world, the year is also on track to be one of the hottest, with global temperatures around 0.57C (1.03F) above the average 14C (57.2F) from January to October, just ahead of the previous record of 0.56C, according to the World Meteorological Organisation. However, the Met Office said that a single year’s extreme weather cannot be attributed to man-made global warming. A spokesman said: ‘One warm year does not necessarily say anything about long-term climate change – these trends need to be looked at over longer timescales of several decades.’ But global warming does make it more likely to have years with hotter-than-average weather, he said. Global: Last year is also set to be the warmest across the globe as temperature rises pushed the average 0.57C above the average of 14C .

"Online retailing giant Amazon has launched its own brand of diapers, opening a new front in retail battles - and a direct challenge to name-brands already selling on the site. Amazon said the first offerings in its new Amazon Elements line of consumer products would be diapers and baby wipes, and that other competitively priced, 'premium' everyday consumer products would soon follow. But the Elements line is only available to members of Amazon's Prime $99-a-year subscription club, with the lowest prices available for those who are also members of its Amazon Mom group, as the company seeks to push more shoppers into its membership programs. Time for change: Amazon is launching the line of diapers and baby wipes exclusively for its Prime members to get more shoppers to sign up for the $99 annual program . Expanding: The launch comes a year after Amazon reported it was recruiting people to help create its own brand of products in the larger category known as consumables . Amazon highlighted that the Elements line would provide quality-conscious shoppers 'an unprecedented level of information' on product origins and materials. 'The two things customers told us they want are premium products that meet their high standards, and access to information so they can make informed decisions,' said Sunny Jain, Amazon.com Consumables Vice President, in a statement. Entering the market: The first offerings in the new Amazon Elements line of consumer products will be diapers and baby wipes . The initial prices, including discounts to Prime members and the Amazon Mom club, put a size 4 diaper 10 percent more expensive than the popular Huggies brand. But it was about 27 percent cheaper than the premium Seventh Generation brand, popular with health and environmentally-conscious consumers, in the Prime and Amazon Mom pricing. Amazon has been seeking to push shoppers into Prime, originally a subscription service for free shipping aimed at frequent buyers on its website. A Prime subscription now gives members unlimited video and music streaming as Amazon takes on powerful media groups like Netflix and Spotify. In some areas, Prime is now offering same day delivery on groceries as well.","Suppliers had long feared Amazon would eventually elbow them aside .

"These are the scenes of squalor which were discovered by police when they arrived at the home of two-year-old girl who died after accidentally drinking her drug addict mother's methadone out of a Tom and Jerry beaker. Barry Jones, 42, and Michelle King, 30, were this week convicted of the killing of little Sophie Jones, who died after drinking from the cup she thought contained her favourite fruit shoot drink. When they arrived at the terraced family home in Blackpool, Lancashire, detectives found medication stacked next to children's toys  and filthy rooms littered with dirty washing and pushchairs. Scroll down for video . These are the scenes which greeted police when they arrived at the home of two-year-old Sophie Jones, who died after accidentally drinking her drug addict mother's methadone out of a Tom and Jerry beaker . Sophie, aged two (pictured) drank from the beaker unaware it was her mother's powerful heroin substitute . The little girl drank from the beaker unaware it was the powerful heroin substitute which her mother Michelle King had been storing to sell on to fund her drug habit - in what police said was akin to 'leaving a loaded firearm in the reach of a child.' Sophie collapsed in March under the effects of the heroin substitute after an eye witness said she looked 'groggy' and was falling over. Paramedics rushed to the family home where the couple lived on benefits but despite attempting to revive her, the toddler was pronounced dead in hospital just 35 minutes later. Tests later showed Sophie had traces of four separate drugs in her hair including heroin, cocaine and diazepam and had been exposed to the drugs for several months. Police later found a quarter of a pint of methadone and the Tom and Jerry Beaker in the back garden . These are the scenes of squalor which awaited police when they they arrived at the terraced family home . It has emerged Sophie's father openly smoked heroin in the same room as his daughter - she had traces four separate drugs in her hair including heroin, cocaine and diazepam and been exposed to the drugs for months . Three of her dummies had traces of cocaine powder on the teat. Methadone was also found on an upstairs bathroom sink. The methadone had been prescribed to King as part of a drug treatment programme but she had been keeping the drug in her daughter's Tom and Jerry beaker, Tommy Tippy cup and Fruit Shoot bottles with a view to selling it on to fund her own drug habit. After Sophie accidentally drank the substance, the couple tried to cover up their role in her death by hiding the beaker and fruit shoot bottles around the family home. They were also seen filling up a wheelie bin with nappies and drug taking equipment. King sent two text messages to Jones relating to the child's drinking cup - one reading 'all the meth bottles out back under green thing'. Another said 'don't tip the methadone out, hide it.' Today pictures of the family's home taken by Lancashire Police emerged as Blackpool Council confirmed a serious case review was underway into the toddler's death. Neightbours have questioned why Sophie was allowed to live with tbe two drug addicts after it emerged her father openly smoked heroin in the same room as his daughter. It is believed there was no social services file into the family open at the time of Sophie's death. Sophie, pictured as a baby, drank from the Tom and Jerry patterned beaker unaware it was the powerful heroin substitute which her mother Michelle King had been storing to sell on to fund her drug habit . Barry Jones, 42, and Michelle King, 30, were convicted of the killing of Sophie Jones at Preston Crown Court. King admitted manslaughter and child cruelty whilst Jones was convicted of unlawful killing and child cruelty . When they arrived at the family home detectives found medication stacked next to children's toys . Father of two Adrian Walenciej, 32, a bar worker who lives in the same street said: 'How can there be two drug addicts with a daughter and no supervision? 'I'm blaming myself, thinking I could have done something and called the council. 'I'll always think if I had done something she could still be here. I thought they were drinking a lot but I didn't know the mum was dealing methadone. 'Accidents happen; a child can reach for medicine but what they did is unimaginable. 'You hear about kids who are born with a drug addiction. Maybe they had tried giving her a bit of methadone to stop her crying before and it had worked? 'We don't know what happened behind those walls, only they know. Nothing will bring that little girl back.' Another neighbour said: 'That couple should be locked up for good. A child does not ask to be put in that situation. 'You do wonder whether they meant for her to drink it but only they know exactly what happened. 'People put teddies outside the front door of the house after Sophie died. I put one there myself because I have children and can't imagine how any mum could do that to her daughter. The court heard a neighbour said in the run up to the tragedy he had often heard arguing between the adults and Sophie would be heard crying for long periods. The trial also heard on March 4 King sent several text messages to a drug user reminding her that she owed her £25. She had also gone to buy crack cocaine before returning home. A relative saw Sophie fall on two occasions and noticed that she was unsteady on her feet. King was heard to say that Sophie was acting weird and Barry to say 'I hope you've not left the top off your tablets'. Blackpool Council have confirmed they have launched a serious case review which is being led by Blackpool Children's Safeguarding Board and involves agencies including the council, health service and police . The methadone was prescribed to King  but she had been keeping the drug in her daughter's Tom and Jerry beaker, Tommy Tippy cup and Fruit Shoot bottles with a view to sell them on to fund her drug habit . Neighbours left flowers and toys outside the family home in Blackpool following Sophie's death in March . Three of Sophie's dummies had traces of cocaine powder on the teat and methadone was found on a sink . The couple were told to call an ambulance but they lied about taking Sophie to a walk in centre and claimed the child may have drunk some cider. They also hid the beaker and fruit shoot bottles around the family home. The pair were also seen filling up a wheelie bin with nappies and drug taking equipment. Eventually at 11.40pm, Jones made a 999 calmly saying: 'I have a two-year-old daughter, right, and I don't think she's breathing - can I have an ambulance please.' An ambulance arrived three minutes after the call and found him in the lounge performing CPR on Sophie following directions being given over the phone. Vomit was visible in Sophie's hair, face, chest and on the floor and appeared to contain blood. While Sophie was in hospital King sent two text messages to Jones relating to the child's drinking cup - one reading 'all the meth bottles out back under green thing'. Another said 'don't tip the methadone out, hide it.' Hidden under a green cover in the back yard police found 146ml of methadone - approximately 1/4 of a pint . Police found traces of cocaine and heroin in the bins and a number of fruit shoot bottles inside the house . But hidden under a green cover in the back yard police found 146ml of methadone - approximately 1/4 of a pint and the Tom and Jerry beaker. They also found a large number of Fruit Shoot bottles at the house - one of which had traces of methadone inside. There were also traces of cocaine and heroin found in the bins. Tests showed Sophie's cause of her death was inhalation of stomach contents and poisoning by methadone - less than a teaspoonful can kill a child. At Preston Crown Court King admitted manslaughter and child cruelty whilst Jones was convicted of unlawful killing and child cruelty following a trial. Today Detective Inspector Andy Cribbin, of Lancashire Police, said: 'Sophie's death was as a direct result of the actions and neglect of her parents, the two people who should have protected her from coming to any harm whatsoever. 'Her death was wholly avoidable and was brought about by their chaotic and reckless use of illegal and prescribed drugs within the family home. 'Storing methadone in a child's drinking cup is akin to leaving a loaded firearm in the reach of a child - the outcome was almost inevitable.' Blackpool Council confirmed the serious case review was being led by Blackpool Children's Safeguarding Board and involves agencies including the council, health service and police.","Pictures show squalid conditions Sophie Jones was living in before death .

"Pantone, the authority responsible for determining what hue will prove most popular in the coming year, has announced its color of 2015: Marsala. And while the New Jersey-based company has been happily singing the praises of the 'hardy, robust' red shade, the wine-inspired tone has already come under some serious fire from critics who have described it as 'boring', 'horrendous' and 'just plain awful'. 'Really, Pantone? That color looks like the vomit you might have after eating a bad chicken Marsala,' Twitter user Gina Torrecilla proclaimed, while Matt Nagel said: 'Marsala just isn't exciting. Radiant Orchid wasn't bad.' Scroll down for video . 'It isn't exciting': Critics of Pantone's color of the year for 2015, named Marsala, were quick to share their opinions on the red-brown hue on Twitter . Fashion favorite: Marsala, Pantone's color of the year for 2015, is expected to feature heavily on catwalks and red carpets in the coming months, having already been seen on designer Mikael D's runway (R) and worn by the likes of Blake Lively (L) Despite the somewhat negative criticism, Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of the Pantone Color Institute, insists the hue will be incredibly popular in the New Year. 'Hardy, robust, satisfying, fulfilling,' she said of the shade. 'At the same time there's a certain glamour that's attached to this color.' Pantone's yearly color pick often serves as a good indication of what shades to expect in the coming year from fashion, beauty, housewares, home and industrial design and consumer packaging, though some years the influence is stronger than others. The 2014 color of the year from the forecasters and industry consultants was Radiant Orchid, a deep tropical purple. The year before that it was Emerald green, while Tangerine Tango was the pick of 2012. The idea, Eiseman explained in a recent interview, is not to choose a color that will necessarily 'overtake the world', but rather one that will leave a lasting impression on a wide variety of industries. Eiseman and her team travel the world to observe color at play. They see Marsala being used in any number of ways, be it an accent wall in a living room or office, a swipe of eye shadow mixed with bronze for a metallic look, a throw pillow, the exterior of a car, or a bit of jewelry evoking the 1950s. Beauty trends: Sephora announced that it will be releasing a make-up collection inspired by Marsala . From cars to carpets: Pantone's yearly color picks influence all manner of industry, from fashion and beauty to industrial design and homewares . 'It really does embody a certain amount of confidence and stability,' Eiseman added. The hue isn't a risky one and the Pantone team believe it will work, whether in a nail polish, a frock on a runway or a pattern of stripes in a men's tie or florals for table placemats or bedding. Eiseman noted the versatile shade was among colors Pantone flagged as spring/summer trends for 2015 earlier this year, as evidenced on the runways of Herve Leger by Max Azria, Dennis Basso and Creatures of the Wind, among other designers. As they did with Radiant Orchid, cosmetics favorite Sephora has already announced the launch of a limited-edition collection of beauty products based on Pantone and its latest pick. Eiseman added that Marsala has been widely used in lipstick and hair color for years. One of the color's strengths, she said, is the ease in combining it with gray, black, beige and other neutrals. 'It's a color that you can mix with what you already own,' she explained. 'You can add just a touch of it. That's the intent and purpose. It is not the color that swallows the world.'","The color authority announced the debut of the red-brown hue earlier today .
While the company insists the shade is 'hardy, robust' and even glamorous, many people have taken to Twitter to blast it as 'boring'"
"An investigation has been launched into the leaking of Defence Minister David Johnston's travel and hospitality receipts. The Defence Department is probing how Senator Johnston and his Chief Of Staff Sean Costello’s expenses were made public, the ABC reports, after it was revealed they indulged in a series of expensive meals with industry officials who are chasing lucrative government contracts. Dining receipts obtained by News Corp journalist Ian McPhedran show Mr Johnston, Mr Costello and defence industry executives spent $6384 of taxpayers money in pricey restaurants during November. Scroll down for video . Receipts showing thousands of taxpayers dollars being spent on lavish meals by Defence Minister David Johnson have been revealed, with this $662 receipt from Sean's Kitchen in Adelaide . The revelations of the meals - often washed down with $200 bottles of wine - come as ordinary troops in Australia's armed services face cuts to their entitlements and a 1.5 per cent pay increase which is below the rate of inflation. A spokesman for the Defence Minister told Daily Mail Australia that the spending was all within guidelines. 'All hospitality hosted by the Defence Minister and extended to foreign dignitaries or industry heads, including at the time of the Albany Commemoration, has been within guidelines and is consistent with previous Defence Ministers’ practice,' the spokesperson said. However, the Opposition's Nick Champion told the ABC the Prime Minister should take action against Senator Johnston. 'It's up to Tony Abbott really, to do what we all know needs to be done,' Mr Champion said. 'We all know it's going to be done. This minister is either going to be demoted, shifted out of his portfolio or sacked completely and put on the backbench.' This receipt shows some of the items indulged in at Balthazar restaurant in Perth on November 12 . The first lavish dinner took place on November 2 at Perth's Matilda Bay Restaurant, where rib eye steaks, lamb and snapper along with three bottles of Henschke Mt Edlestone Shiraz at $190 a bottle contributed to the $2332 bill, News Corp reported. The prestigious establishment has waterfront views of the Swan River. Just a few days later, on November 5, Mr Johnston and Mr Costello were in Adelaide dining with Bruce Carter, chairman of submarine builder ASC and one of the companies chasing government work, sources told News Corp. The trio polished off two bottles of $143 shiraz at Sean's Kitchen, and two martinis at $20 each, according to the $662 receipt. Defence Minister David Johnston (left) and his Chief Of Staff Sean Costello (right) dined with industry executives hoping to secure billion dollar government contracts . These accusations come as defence personnel are facing cuts to their allowances and pay . The next stop was Balthazar Restaurant in Perth where the $722 bill - again racked up between just three people - included two $172 bottles of Omensetter Shiraz, two pork fillets and a cheese platter, News Corp reported. For the November 12 dinner, Mr Johnston and Mr Costello shared a meal and a few drinks with 'a senior executive from Austal.' Shipbuilder Austal is also seeking defence work from the government according to News Corp. Matilda Bay in Perth was revisited on November 15 where the bill racked up by seven guests at the waterfront restaurant was $2062. Rib eye steaks were on the menu again, as were two bottles of Picardy Chardonnay at $170 a pop. Bruce Carter, Chairman of submarine builder ASC (left) and Andrew Bellamy, head of WA shipbuilder Austal (right) were among some of the pair's dinner guests . The final dinner destination for November was the Courgette in Canberra, where Mr Johnston and Mr Costello were joined by two others, totalling $599 for dinner and drinks. In stark contrast, ordinary defence personnel who travel on business are afforded allowances of $24 for breakfast, $28 for lunch and $47 for dinner.","Defence Department launches an investigation into leaked receipts .

"The Navy is revoking former-sailor Bill Cosby's title of honorary chief petty officer, saying allegations of sexual abuse made against the comedian are serious and conflict with the Navy's core values. Navy Secretary Ray Mabus and Master Chief Petty Officer Michael Stevens made the announcement Thursday in a statement. 'The Navy is taking this action because allegations against Mr. Cosby are very serious and are in conflict with the Navy's core values of honor, courage and commitment,' they said in a statement.

In a statement, the Navy said the allegations against Cosby are in conflict with the military branch's 'core values'.  Pictured again at the 2011 ceremony . Cosby enlisted in the Navy in 1956 and served four years as a hospital corpsman before being honorably discharged in 1960 as a 3rd Class Petty Officer. The honorary title was presented to Cosby in 2011. The 77-year-old Cosby has refused to answer questions about mounting accusations that he sexually abused several women. NBC recently scrapped a Cosby comedy that was under development, some of his appearances have been canceled and he has resigned from Temple University's board of trustees. Former sailor: Cosby enlisted in the Navy in 1956, and spend four years as a hospital corpsman before he was honorably discharged in 1960 . Scores of women started coming forward to accuse Cosby of rape in October, after comedian Hannibal Buress went on a rant about the former Cosby Show dad's dark side during a stand-up set. Since then, at least 20 women, including former super model Janice Dickinson, have publicly accused Cosby of rape, with many saying he drugged them too. The allegations go all the way back to 2004 though, when a former Temple University employee went to authorities after  Cosby groped her. The case was eventually thrown out, with investigators saying there wasn't enough evidence to charge Cosby, so the woman filed a civil suit instead and four 13 other women to testify about Cosby's history of sex abuse. The lawsuit was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount.

"Thirteen illegal immigrants have been found in a tanker containing plastic granules at Dover's Eastern Docks, in Kent. The men, eleven from Syria and two from Afghanistan, were fit and well when Border Force and Home Office immigration enforcement officers attended yesterday. No action is being taken against the tanker's driver. They are the latest group to be detained at Dover amid concerns from the British freight industry about migrants' increasingly desperate attempts to reach the UK from Calais. Scroll down for video . The illegal immigrant's attempt to enter the UK is the latest of migrant's increasingly desperate attempts to reach the UK from Calais (stock pics) All 13 migrants will be interviewed and passed into the care of the county's social services department if they are found to be minors. The Freight Transport Association (FTA) has described the number of migrants attempting to enter the country illegally as a 'worsening situation'. They are now calling on the European Union to bring in stricter border controls to deal with the problem. More than 3,000 people have signed an e-petition demanding the UK Government helps solve the problems faced by British truckers. On September 4, scores of illegal migrants in the French port of Calais tried to force their way onto a ferry bound for England. The desperate migrants had tried to run up the MyFerryLink ship. About 85 people had forced their way through a gate and climbed over fences, overpowering security staff. But they were foiled when crew raised the ramp before they could get to the ferry. In the second wave, 150 illegal immigrants gained entrance to the port but were stopped by police. Recently, French police have tried to break up the camps of illegal immigrants around Calais, but the migrants claim they have nowhere to go. They want fines of up to £2,000 per migrant, imposed on lorry drivers and hauliers if stowaways are caught hiding in their vehicles, to be abolished. Truckers have complained about armed attacks from people trying to board vehicles destined for the UK. A Home Office spokesman said: 'We work closely with the police to tackle illegal immigration and continue to strengthen the security of our border to stop those who have no right to enter the UK. 'If people have a genuine need of protection they should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach. 'If they are just seeking to evade immigration control they need to know that they are risking their lives and that they will get caught. 'The new Immigration Act makes it harder for people to live in the UK illegally. 'It makes it harder for illegal immigrants to abuse our benefits and public services, and makes it easier for us to remove them by reducing the number of appeals.'","All the men were found fit and well and have been detained by immigration .

"Motorists were spared fuel price rises as the Chancellor confirmed a freeze on petrol and diesel duty would go ahead as planned from April 2015. George Osborne announced he was scrapping the ‘trigger-point’ for automatically putting up duty if oil prices drop below a set level, as they did recently. But yesterday’s parallel report by the Office for Budget Responsibility suggested that duty rises could return in September 2015 and rise in line with inflation from 2016 to 2019. Relief: George Osborne announced he was scrapping the ‘trigger-point’ for automatically putting up duty . AA president Edmund King welcomed the confirmed April 2015 freeze but said the OBR report appeared to confirm the fears of 84 per cent of AA members in a recent poll who said they were concerned that motoring taxes would increase after next May’s general election. Mr Osborne said he was ‘freezing fuel duty to help hardworking people be more financially secure’. He added: ‘Action on fuel duty since 2011 will save a typical motorist £675 by the end of 2015-16.’ However, the OBR report said: ‘The next duty rate rise, planned for September 2015, means that receipts are expected to increase by 0.3 per cent in 2015-16. Sceptical: Motorists fear rises in duty in the future . 'From April 2016 onwards duty rate rises are assumed to be in line with RPI inflation, leading to receipts growth of 2.5 per cent on average between 2016-17 and 2019-20.’ Mr King said: ‘Today’s re-confirmation of a £15billion investment in UK roads and the continuing fuel duty freeze puts drivers on a “highway to hope” after some hellish years of high fuel prices, potholed roads and only patchy investment. 'But our members were right to be sceptical about future taxes.’ RAC Foundation director Professor Stephen Glaister said: ‘The Chancellor is pushing for more transparency in the pricing of airline tickets, so now he should also back our call for pump receipts to show how much of the price of petrol and diesel is tax. 'Currently well over 60 per cent goes to the Exchequer in the form of fuel duty and VAT.’ RAC chief engineer David Bizley said: ‘The negative impact of fuel duty on economic growth is now acknowledged by the Treasury. 'With fuel duty already frozen until May 2015, we had feared an early return to the fuel duty escalator system – a deeply unpopular practice which led to a series of fuel duty hikes. 'But, for now, it appears that is not going to be the case.’ Howard Cox, founder of the FairFuelUK Campaign, said the government should investigate why pump price falls are not keeping pace with plummeting oil prices: ‘There should be 7p less showing at the pumps. Who is holding onto this profit?’ Motorway filling stations will soon have to post their prices in advance on roadside signs so motorists can see if there is cheaper fuel ahead. Ministers were inspired by the system used in France where motorists can see the price of fuel at a variety of outlets on signposts (pictured) miles before they reach each service station. It is hoped the move will promote competition and lower fuel prices. The signs will be tested at five service stations on the M5 between Bristol and Exeter, with a view to being introduced UK-wide by the end of 2015. The RAC last month found motorway service stations charge 10p more a litre of petrol than the national average.","Tax will once again be fixed at its current level in April next year .

"A cybersecurity expert has raised the possibility that the cyberattack on Sony Pictures was not the work of North Korea, but instead carried out by a disgruntled employee. The hacking attack saw five major new films leaked alongside studio and personnel information which included the salaries of staff and personal emails. North Korea has refused to deny claims that it is behind a release and a spokesperson for the country would only say 'wait and see' when asked if Pyongyang was involved in the attack on Sony just a month before its planned release of a movie about a plot to kill the reclusive state's leader, Kim Jong Un. Cars enter Sony Pictures Entertainment headquarters in Culver City, California. A cybersecurity expert has raised the possibility that the cyberattack on Sony Pictures was not the work of North Korea . A North Korean spokesperson said 'wait and see' on Monday when asked if Pyongyang was involved in the attack on Sony just a month before its planned release of The Interview, staring James Franco and Seth Rogan . North Korea routinely refers to the United States and South Korea as hostile forces. But cybersecurity expert Hemanshu Nigam told the Hollywood Reporter that he finds it hard to believe that North Korea is the perpetrator and instead thinks it is more probable that it was the actions of an  employee or ex-employee with administrative access privileges. For the studio — which has laid off hundreds of employees over the past year in an effort to contain costs — the possibility of a disgruntled employee wreaking havoc is very real. 'If terabytes of data left the Sony networks, their network detection systems would have noticed easily,' explains Nigam. 'It would also take months for a hacker to figure out the topography of the Sony networks to know where critical assets are stored and to have access to the decryption keys needed to open up the screeners that have been leaked.' Culprit? Sony is currently investigating whether someone acting on behalf of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, possibly from China, was responsible for hacking their computer system . In addition, he says, 'Hackers don't use such things as Hushmail, Dropbox and Facebook when they want to engage in what amounts to criminal activity. Real hackers know that these sites collect access logs, IP addresses and work with law enforcement. It is possible that North Korean-sponsored hackers were working with someone on the inside. But it is more likely a ruse to shift blame, knowing the distaste the North Korean regime has for Sony Pictures.' Sony Pictures' computer system went down last Monday after the cyber attack. Before . screens went dark, they displayed a red skull and the phrase . 'Hacked By #GOP,' which reportedly stands for Guardians of . Peace. The hackers also warned they . would release 'secrets' stolen from Sony. The data released so far from the apparently leaked documents has already been damaging - it revealed all the top executives at Sony Pictures Entertainment are white and male, raising questions about control of Hollywood's film output. A spreadsheet said to show the salaries of 6,000 Sony Pictures employees, including top executives, reveals that of 17 earning $1million or more a year, just two are not white and just one is a woman. The list was leaked to a reporter at news and pop culture site Fusion. Sony workers reportedly saw a message appear on computer screens saying 'Hacked by #GOP', understood to be the initials of a group called Guardians of Peace - although some believe North Korea was involved . Kevin Roose, reporting for Fusion, who was sent a link to the data by an anonymous source, said: 'When I sorted the list by 'annual rate,' I noticed something notable: a stark homogeneity among the people earning the most. 'Based on the spreadsheet ... the employees of Sony Pictures with the highest annual rates appear to be nearly entirely white men.' Amy B. Pascal, co-chair of Sony Pictures Entertainment and chairman of SPE's Motion Picture Group, is the only woman among the top 17 most-highly paid executives. Minority of one: Co-Chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment Amy Pascal, the only woman earning more than $1million a year at the company, and chief executive officer of Sony Entertainment Michael Lynton . She earns £3million a year, according to the spreadsheet, joint highest on the list, along with Sony Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton. Buzzfeed reviewed almost 40GB of leaked internal data and reported it included 'employee criminal background checks, salary negotiations, and doctors' letters explaining the medical rationale for leaves of absence.' It reported the files also included a script for an unreleased pilot written by Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan as well as 'email exchanges with employees regarding specific medical treatments they are undergoing, while one disciplinary letter details a manager's romantic relationship and business travel history with a subordinate.' It even details the leaked information includes an email about the breastfeeding diet of a senior executive. Technology news site Re/code reported that Sony and security . consultants were investigating whether someone acting on behalf . of North Korea, possibly from China, was responsible. A source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Saturday . that Sony Pictures was investigating every possibility, adding . that no link to North Korea has been uncovered. North Korea complained to the United Nations in June about . the film starring Seth Rogen and James Franco, accusing the . United States of sponsoring terrorism and committing an act of . war by allowing production of the movie. Leaked: Five of Sony's movies including the hotly anticipated remake of Annie have been illegally shared online in recent days . The Interview is due to be released on December 25 in the United States and Canada. It is a comedy about a CIA attempt to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The Pyongyang government denounced the film as 'undisguised sponsoring of terrorism, as well as an act of war' in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. 'I personally don't care if (the movie's) disrespectful to . Kim because he's evil. But that's not the intent,' Rogen posted . on Twitter on Sunday. 'North Korea has produced tons of . propaganda films that portray America's destruction.' In addition to Annie, starring Jamie Foxx, which is due to hit theaters on December 19, Brad Pitt's critically acclaimed World War Two movie, Fury, is also being openly traded and downloaded online. By Sunday morning, Fury, which is still playing in theaters, had been downloaded 1.2 million times and Annie had been downloaded 206,000 times from unique IP addresses, according to Variety. Other Sony movies being downloaded include Mr. Turner, Still Alice and To Write Love on Her Arms. Culver City, California-based Sony Pictures said in a statement yesterday that it is continuing 'to work through issues related to what was clearly a cyber attack last week. 'The company has restored a number of important services to ensure ongoing business continuity and is working closely with law enforcement officials to investigate the matter.' Along with the FBI, Sony has brought in forensic experts from the Mandiant division of FireEye, a Silicon Valley cybersecurity company, according to a source familiar with the case who did not want to be named because the companies have not yet announced the arrangement. Mandiant helps companies determine the extent of breaches and repair damages. The firm has worked on other high-profile computer breaches, including one at retailer Target last year.","The hacking attack saw five major new films leaked alongside studio and personnel secrets which included the salaries of staff and personal emails .

"We've all heard that age-old adage that travel broadens the mind - but does it really? While today it's common practice to take that gap-year abroad, exploring new places and putting off university for 12 additional months, a survey  found that the majority didn't believe this year off had helped them positively develop as a person. In fact, more than a third of respondents even admitted that they struggled to make the transition from carefree lifestyle to a nine-to-five work mentality. Does a year abroad really broaden your horizons? New research of 1,000 UK backpackers says no! Student shipping specialist, 1StopShip, conducted the research, finding that 60 per cent of those surveyed didn't believe that their time away had been particularly beneficial. Twenty eight per cent, however, did believe they'd changed for the better - but quickly reverted back to their old attitude when they arrived back on British soil. To add more salt to the wound, 29 per cent of people questioned confessed to growing sick of their backpacking buddy’s endless stories and 12 per cent stated that their friends returned with a false sense of superiority. And those who are planning to travel post-university before joining the working world? Well, you may want to reconsider. Though gap years have become increasingly popular, 60 per cent of those surveyed didn't think it had been all that beneficial to their personal development . Many felt that the travelling and partying made it more difficult to transition into a nine-to-five lifestyle . Thirty four per cent admitted that they struggled with transitioning into a nine-to-five lifestyle. Fourteen per cent admitted their stint overseas left them dreading work and feeling unprepared and 23 per cent still felt unsettled once they had landed their first job upon return. It seems as though those concerns are also reflected by employers. Nineteen per cent said that their current boss viewed their time spent travelling as a negative, while 14 per cent struggled to get a job due to their lack of experience compared to non-travelling counterparts. But 39 per cent did view their experiences abroad as a positive on their CV. Ian Brown, from 1StopShip, commented: 'While the research may seem a little damning when it comes to taking a gap year, we know from our customers – a good proportion of whom are young people, recent school leavers or graduates – that there can be huge benefits too. When it came to employers, 19% felt that their current boss viewed their time abroad as a 'negative' 'We would advise anyone looking to genuinely enrich themselves, or make a positive impression on prospective employers to consider incorporating both work and travel, such as teaching or temping overseas; this can ensure you acquire new skills, whilst also experiencing a new culture and seeing new places.' Emily Moult, a former Leeds Metropolitan University student who spent a year teaching English as a foreign language (TEFL) in France, agrees. She said: 'I reflect fondly on my year teaching abroad and think of it as a serious life-changing experience. 'Not only did I get to see new places, but I was also able to improve my language skills and gain a whole host of new skills, all of which helped me enormously when it came to getting a full-time job.'","Majority of respondents felt that the year hadn't been particularly beneficial .

"The controversial 'hands up, don't shoot' protest by St Louis Rams players has been praised by an organisation representing the city's black police officers, it has been revealed. Five players made the gesture at Missouri's Edward Jones Dome on Sunday following the decision not to indict police officer Darren Wilson over the death of unarmed teen Michael Brown. Their actions, in a game against the Oakland Raiders, were branded 'tasteless, offensive and inflammatory' by the St Louis Police Officers Association, which demanded a 'very public apology' from the team. But today it has been revealed that their view was not necessarily shared by all of the city's law-enforcement community. Scroll down for video . St Louis Rams wide receiver Stedman Bailey (12), wide receiver Tavon Austin (11), tight end Jared Cook (89), wide receiver Chris Givens (13) and wide receiver Kenny Britt (81) put their hands up to show support for Michael Brown before Sunday's game against the Oakland Raiders at the Edward Jones Dome . The players made the gesture at Missouri's Edward Jones Dome on Sunday following the decision not to indict police officer Darren Wilson over the death of unarmed teen Michael Brown (pictured) The Ethical Society of Police, which describes itself as the 'primary voice of African-American police officers in St Louis', does not have a problem with the gesture. A statement posted on its Facebook page, said it 'completely supports the actions of the St. Louis Rams football players in which they showed support for the family of Michael Brown by entering the stadium with their hands up.' 'We think that their actions were commendable and that they should not be ridiculed, disciplined or punished for taking a stand on this very important issue which is of great concern around the world and especially in the community where these players work.' CNN reports that the group has about 220 members from the St. Louis police force and that St Louis Police Offices Association has yet to respond to requests for comment. The NFL players who made the 'hands up, don't shoot' gesture in solidarity with Ferguson protesters will not be fined nor disciplined for their actions, it has been reported. Kenny Britt (pictured) raises his hands in the air at the game. The meaning of the gesture has been disputed following contradictory witness accounts, some of which claim Michael Brown did not have his hands up . The five St Louis Rams footballers performed the now-famous sign on the field before the team's game against the Oakland Raiders at Missouri's Edward Jones Dome on Sunday. Following the gesture, officials from the St Louis County Police Association - the police union for the area including riot-stricken Ferguson - demanded that the players be punished by their superiors. The team later denied claims that it had issued an apology to the organisation. It has since been revealed that the NFL will not take disciplinary action against the players: wide receivers Stedman Bailey,Tavon Austin, Chris Givens and Kenny Britt, and tight end, Jared Cook. The 'hands up, don't shoot' gesture was a reference to witness accounts of Ferguson officer Darren Wilson's fatal shooting of Michael Brown,on August 9. Some protesters claim the unarmed black 18-year-old was raising his hands in surrender when he was shot 12 times by Wilson. However, the accounts have been disputed. It comes as people have been taking to streets of more than 170 U.S. cities in protest against a grand jury's recent decision to not indict Mr Wilson in the fatal shooting.

After making the gesture on Sunday, wide receiver Bailey said he and his teammates decided to raise their hands in the air shortly before the game, and intended it to be something positive. A Rams spokesman said on Sunday that the team was not aware the gesture had been planned before the game against the Oakland Raiders. On Sunday, wide receivers Tavon Austin and Kenny Britt came out together first, with the move obscured by a smoke machine in the upper reaches of the stadium. Stedman Bailey, Jared Cook and Chris Givens - all of whom are black - then came out and stood together with arms raised. After Tre Mason scored on an 8-yard run to make it 45-0 in the fourth quarter, the gesture made another appearance when he and Britt raised their hands together.

"Further grisly details have come out in court at the trial of a Florida mother accused of stabbing and choking her neighbor to death before hacking the victim's body into pieces and cooking them on her stove in a brutal, premeditated murder. A medical examiner has now revealed that the head and torso of limousine driver James Sheaffer was never found, and that only 56 of his 206 bones were recovered following his slaying in April 2013. Angela Stoldt, 42, of Deltona, sat motionless this week at her first-degree murder trial as details of the killing were laid out for the jury. It was also revealed that, after boiling some of the body parts in her kitchen - including a foot, a leg and both arms - Stoldt allegedly had her two teenage children help dump the remains in different spots around Volusia County, telling them she had hit a deer with her car. The prosecution say Stoldt drugged her neighbor Sheaffer before driving him to Osteen Cemetery in Deltona, stabbing him in both eyes with an ice pick, and choking him with a cord. Gruesome: Angela Stoldt, 42, of Deltona, sat motionless in court this week as the jury was told the details of her alleged murder of neighbor James Sheaffer, following a dispute about money . Gruesome murder: Angela Stoldt, 42 (left), allegedly stabbed neighbor James Sheaffer, 36 (right), with an ice pick, strangled him and then tried to dispose of his body by hacking it to pieces and cooking the remains . Crime scene: Stoldt got into an argument with Sheaffer while sitting in her car at the Osteen Cemetery in Deltona in April 2013 . Prosecutors said they will not be seeking the death penalty in Stoldt's case. In September, Stold's attorney filed a motion claiming self defense under Florida's controversial 'stand your ground' law, but Judge Randell Rowe III rejected the motion. Court documents obtained by Daytona News-Journal previously showed Sheaffer, a married father of three, had asked Stoldt to act as the payee on his Social Security disability benefits, but the 36-year-old kept overdrawing their joint account. The limo driver also wanted Stoldt to ask her father for a $4,000 loan. On the morning of April 3, 2013, Stoldt, with her two children in tow, picked up her neighbor from his work at Blue Diamond Limousines and drove to her home on Horseshoe Terrace, where the two drank vodka and peach schnapps cocktails. But according to court filings, the mother of two spiked her neighbor's beverage with a prescription pain medication, which she had stolen from her father knowing that it causes drowsiness, especially when mixed with alcohol. Stoldt then allegedly loaded the drugged man into her car and drove to the Osteen Cemetery after dropping the kids off at her parents'. Husband and father: Sheaffer, who was married with three kids, was stabbed in the eye and then strangled; police were never able to locate all of his remains . While Stoldt had previously claimed Sheaffer 'came at her and said that he was going to kill Ms. Stoldt as well as her children', according to her strand-your-ground, Prosecutor Ryan Will told the jury she had planned to kill Sheaffer all along. She reached to the backseat for the ice pick and stabbed Sheaffer in the right eye. She then grabbed a cord with two handles and used it to strangle Sheaffer by wrapping it tightly around his neck, Will said. After the man stopped moving, the mother grabbed the ice pick again and drove it through Sheaffer's left eye. She then wrapped the man's head in Saran Wrap to keep him from bleeding all over the car interior. The News-Journal reported that Stoldt had bought the plastic, as well as rubber gloves, from Wal-Mart just hours before the killing. She then drove home, with Sheaffer's corpse propped up in the passenger seat, the ice pick still protruding from his face. Will said Stoldt then drove to her home and parked in the garage, where she cut up Sheaffer's body using a knife and a saw. She then moved the body parts one by one into her kitchen. Life and death situation: Stoldt's attorney filed a motion claiming that the woman was in fear for her life because Sheaffer was threatening to kill her and her two children . 'She took him into the house piece by piece. ... The very same house she shares with her two teenage children and she cooked him in her oven and stove. She started with the oven but when the smoke and smell became unbearable she realized that she might get caught,' Will told the court. Thats when Stoldt allegedly began boiling some parts on the stove. Sheaffer's head and torso were not found, testified Dr. Marie Herrmann, the medical examiner for Volusia County. However a soup pot was recovered that contained  Sheaffer's thigh bone, knee cap and some soft tissue, Hermann testified. Stoldt dumped other mutilated body parts in trash bags and disposed of them with the help of her teenage son, who was led to believe that they were getting rid of a deer his mother had killed with her car the night before. To cover up the murder, Miss Stoldt then buried her neighbor's cellphone and driver’s license in different parks, and got rid of the pots and pans used to boil human flesh. When Stoldt's daughter, who is now 16 years old, asked her about the foul smell lingering in the house, the 42-year-old woman initially lied that a rat had gotten trapped inside the oven. But she eventually came clean to the girl, telling her that she had drugged and killed James Sheaffer after he threatened to kill her. However, it was not until three weeks later that Angela Stoldt confessed to the rest of her family, prompting her sister to call 911 on April 21 because she was afraid the distraught, sleep-deprived woman might commit suicide. In the course of her questioning, Miss Stoldt spoke without hesitation of her attempts to dispose of her neighbor's corpse. 'Thursday is when I was cooking him. Friday is when I was dumping him,' she was quoted as saying. The woman showed little remorse for her actions, telling police she believed at the time Sheaffer was going to ruin her life. ‘I’m sorry, but I put Jimmie where he belonged, in my opinion at the time,’ she told detectives. Ms Stoldt eventually led sheriff's deputies to various locations around Volusia County to help recover James Sheaffer's remains, but officials said they were never able to locate all of Sheaffer's body parts. Confrontation: Sheaffer, a limo driver, allegedly attacked Stoldt while sitting in her car and would not let go of her until she wrapped a cord around his neck . Investigators who canvassed Sheaffer’s Deltona neighborhood looking for the missing man before Stoldt’s confession had talked to the woman on more than one occasion. She acknowledged being friends with Sheaffer and said she handled some of his financial affairs for him. She told investigators that she last saw Sheaffer on April 5 and 15, even though family members hadn’t seen him since April 2. The investigation took a turn April 20 when Stoldt’s sister called 911 saying that the mother of two was acting suicidal and had admitted to killing James Sheaffer. The caller told the Sheriff’s office that Stoldt was hugging her children and saying goodbye. ‘Why’s she hugging her kids goodbye?’ the emergency dispatcher asked. ‘Because she came to the house and she told my parents that she committed a crime and that she’s being investigated for it,’ the woman’s sister replied. Ms Stoldt initially declined to talk to investigators and was taken in for a mental health evaluation. But officials were able to obtain a search warrant to enter her house, where they came upon evidence indicating a crime had been committed there. A short time later, Angela Stoldt confessed to stabbing and strangling Sheaffer, and then disposing of his body. Stoldt then led investigators to a location where human remains were recovered. Ms Stoldt is being held without bail.","Angela Stoldt, 42, confessed to killing limo driver James Sheaffer, 36, in April 2013 by stabbing him in the face and strangling him with a cord .

"A Sydney man who allegedly claimed he was a member of Islamic State before threatening to behead a police officer says the whole thing has been 'blown out of proportion'. Lamin Savage, 24, is accused of calling Granville police station in Sydney's west in September and threatening to cut off the head of an officer who had arrested him for driving offences two months earlier. Police say Savage claimed to be a member of the Islamic State when he made the call. A man has been accused of threatening to behead a police officer (generic police photo shown) But on Wednesday the 24-year-old interrupted his bail application and told the Supreme Court that 'things have been blown out of proportion'. 'I just made a phone call to the cop shop to make a complaint,' Savage said while appearing via audio visual link in prison greens. 'It is just distressing. I don't want my family drawn in on this.' The refugee from Sierra Leone made the comments after his mother Bintu Savage gave evidence that she could supervise her son if he was released on bail and could post the $400 as surety. The court heard Savage had been diagnosed with a borderline intellectual disability. He allegedly claimed to be part of the Islamic State. In this photo Iraqi military armoured trucks pass next to a building painted in the colors of the Islamic State flag as they take up position in Iraq . Although the crown consented to him being released on bail, Justice Helen Wilson said it was a 'very serious offence'. She will hand down her decision at a later date. In denying him bail at Parramatta Local a court earlier this year, Magistrate Margaret McGlynn said the facts before the court were 'of great concern'. 'The latest charges fit info a disturbing pattern of escalating threats,' Ms McGlynn said in September. Savage, who has been charged with using a carriage service to threaten to kill and three driving offences, is expected to face a local court hearing in March.

"There are renewed calls for a federal ICAC as Australia slips out of the world's top 10 nations known for their squeaky clean public sectors. Transparency International says Australia has fallen for the third straight year in its global Corruption Perceptions Index, dropping from an impressive ranking of seven in 2012 to 11 in 2014. Australia slipped out of the top 10 for just the second time in the index's 20-year history. Transparency International Australia director Professor A.J. Brown said the drop was 'of great concern' The annual index measures expert and business opinion of public sector corruption across 175 countries. 'This is a real and significant drop which is of great concern,' Transparency International Australia director Professor A.J. Brown told reporters in Sydney. He said the results indicated a concern about the effectiveness of corruption fighting bodies like the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption that recently exposed alleged rorting of donations laws by Liberal MPs. 'There are questions as to whether the ICAC has the right prosecution follow-up powers,' he said. 'Our assessment is that it's not simply a question of more scandals ... the slide shows growing concern about the adequacy of responses to corruption risks, especially at the federal level.' Prof Brown said Australia's position would get worse if no action was taken on introducing a federal anti-corruption body. Major scandals this year included the prosecutions of Reserve Bank note-printing subsidiaries, allegations of widespread union corruption and the ICAC's probe into alleged systemic rorting of political donation laws by Liberal NSW MPs. The ICAC said in November former state Labor ministers Eddie Obeid and Ian Macdonald would be prosecuted over adverse corruption findings. Denmark and New Zealand were ranked as the top two cleanest countries in the world, while North Korea and Somalia were perceived to be most corrupt.

"In the battle of the heartwarming Christmas adverts, one airline has gone all out to deliver festive cheer. Canadian airline WestJet delivered its own Christmas miracle by sending Santa Claus to the Dominican Republic and spread some joy in the Caribbean. WestJet employees and volunteers headed to a small community and placed a surprise sleigh placed in the middle of town. WestJet surprised residents of Nuevo Renacer, Dominican Republic with a gigantic sleigh in the town centre . During the day, community members all had a chance to communicate to Santa via the sleigh’s video screen and tell him what they wanted for Christmas this year. Requests were as diverse as a new engine for a man’s motorbike taxi business to a skateboard to a horse. The next morning, the volunteers headed out shopping to gather all of the items on the community’s list. WestJet then invited everyone down to the beach for a Christmas party for a surprise - everything that they had asked for in personalised blue waterproof bins. Except for the horse, which was hand-delivered by Santa himself. They even brought in snow for the kids to play in, marking the first time that most of the Nuevo Renacer community had ever seen it. And if those heart-warming acts weren’t enough to get you choked up, WestJet assured that tears would flow by unveiling one final surprise for the poor coastal residents: a brand new community playground. After the community left their holiday gift wishes for Santa, they were all called to the beach the following day . WestJet volunteers had gone shopping and collected all of the items on the community's list . 'In this community, they have to drive 20 minutes and actually pay to use a playground, so by introducing a playground, it really does create a safe environment for them to play in,' Corey Evans, Sponsorship, Community Investment and Experiential Marketing Manager at WestJet explained. Corey also spoke about the company's decision to take this year's Christmas Miracle abroad. 'We chose to shoot the video this year in the Dominican Republic because we’d been working with our partners, Live Different, there since 2012,' he said. 'We’ve really gotten to know the residents, so over the years of working with them, we’ve really just identified their core values to be similar to ours.' The airline workers surprised the community members on the beach with everything from a new motorbike engine to a washing machine to a horse . WestJet is a low-cost Canadian carrier, travelling to the United States, the Caribbean and Europe. It was founded in 1996 and is currently the second-largest Canadian airline behind Air Canada. The brand is also known for it's emotional Christmas adverts, with this year's Christmas Miracle marking the third in the trilogy. 'This was really the last chapter in the Blue Santa trilogy,' Corey added. And if that weren't enough, WestJet also surprised the town with a brand new playground set . But don't fret - that doesn't mean that WestJet is abandoning their tear-jerking holiday adverts forever. 'If our guests feel that it’s something they’d like to see again next year, we’ll certainly put our heads together and see what we can come up with.' Last year, WestJet set up a video booth where travellers could tell Santa their holiday gift wishes in real-time. From there, travellers boarded their flights from Hamilton and Toronto, Ontario, and by the time they landed at their destination, special gifts were waiting to greet them at baggage claim. In 2012, the airline staged a gigantic holiday flash mob at the Calgary International Airport before a sold out flight to Toronto.","Airline debuts 'Spirit of Giving' advert, bringing gifts to the Caribbean .

"It is one of London's most iconic venues, but Southbank's Oxo Tower restaurant has been voted to have the 'most disappointing cooking' in the 2015 edition of Harden's London Restaurants guide. And Hammersmith's much-loved River Cafe didn't fare much better, dubbed an 'overcrowded' and 'impersonal place' where 'uneventful' dishes come at 'merciless prices'. While celebrity favourite Chiltern Firehouse - frequented by Cara Delevingne and Lindsay Lohan - may be an 'amazing' room, the Hardenʼs survey found the food at Andre Balazsʼs hotel where 'poseurs and paparazzi abound' actually 'meh'. Scroll down for video . The Ledbury in Notting Hill was named London's best restaurant after coming first in the Top Gastronomic Experience, Highest Rated Restaurant (Food) and Highest Rated Restaurant (Overall) lists . Cara Delevingne and Lindsay Lohan have been seen at Chiltern Firehouse. The food at the restaurant was described as 'meh' by the guide's reporters . But it's not all doom and gloom in the capital's dining scene. The Ledbury in Notting Hill was named London's best restaurant after coming first in the Top Gastronomic Experience, Highest Rated Restaurant (Food) and Highest Rated Restaurant (Overall) lists. Neighbourhood restaurant Chez Bruce in Wandsworth Common was – for the 10th year running – voted Londonʼs Favourite Restaurant, marking an incredible double for restaurateur Nigel Platts-Marin who is also the backer of The Ledbury.

After his disappearance from the Top 10 gastronomic experience list last year, Gordon Ramsay mounted something of a comeback. His flagship Royal Hospital Road restaurant (helmed by Clare Smyth)has returned to the list. The Anchor & Hope in Waterloo nabbed top stop for the ninth year in the Best Bar/Pub Food list with reviewers heaping praise on the 'convivial' South Bank boozer – with its 'hearty' but 'superbly precise' British cooking. By contrast, appearing on the Most Disappointing Cooking list for the first time is Ollie Dabbousʼs eponymous flagship, Dabbous in Fitzrovia.

The 24th edition of Harden's London Restaurants also recorded the highest ever rate of net new restaurant openings in the capital, with a whopping 148 new eateries popping up in the last year. The figure for closings, 47, was the lowest this millennium, resulting in net openings this year of 101 – nearly a third higher than the previous record of 75 (noted in the guide's 2006 edition). 1.

'It underlines London's continued emergence as the greatest restaurant city on the planet, but – in the 24 years in which we have tracked openings – such highpoints have also often heralded more competitive times ahead.'

"Video has surfaced of a violent brawl at last week’s Stereosonic festival in Sydney, which saw one man knocked unconscious amid a flurry of punches from a group of men. The footage shows about 20 well-built men throwing punches in the mosh pit of the stage at the Sydney Showgrounds. Security guards in high visibility shirts can be seen failing to stop the wild brawl, while surrounding punters barely bat an eyelid at the man who is lying unconscious, continuing to dance around him. Video has surfaced of a violent brawl at last week’s Stereosonic festival, which saw a man in blue shorts knocked unconscious amid a flurry of punches . Richard Calugay, who watched the fight first hand, told Daily Mail Australia it started with pushing. ‘Someone pushed me in the back and the whole crowd started backing up. One of the guys king hit the guy in a blue shorts and knocked him out, and then it was on’ he said. ‘The guy was knocked out cold. I saw him get carried away by his mates, and we left the stage at that point, but I heard the fight kept on going afterwards.’ Mr Calugay said security were simply outnumbered at the event. ‘I think the security were reluctant to get involved because of the size of the guys and the amount of people around. They were outnumbered and didn’t think it was worth the risk.’ Security guards in high-vis shirts can be seen failing to apprehend the wild brawl . The surrounding punters barely bat an eyelid at the man who is lying unconscious, continuing to dance around him . Stereosonic is an annual music festival with events in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. This year saw more than 81,000 revellers attend the Sydney festival . Mr Calugay said he believes the type and the number of festival-goers set the scene for a brawl. ‘I think Stereosonic is a very alpha-male festival. There are a lot of big guys in there, and when you mix that with a crowd of that size, you have a recipe for violence.’ He said he saw other fights throughout the day that weren’t filmed. The clip has received hundreds of thousands of views since being uploaded. NSW police said they were disappointed with the large number of revellers found in possession of prohibited drugs at the music festival on the weekend. There were 196 people found in possession of prohibited drugs at the festival, including MDMA, cocaine, cannabis, GHB and Ketamine. Stereosonic is an annual festival that takes place in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth.

"A Russian businessman who erected a garden fence that looks just like the gate that surrounded the Buchenwald concentration camp has denied he is anti-Semitic. Nestor Lavrov, 53, commissioned the fence because he liked the design after seeing the images online and claims he had not realised the historical context of the words 'Jedem Das Seine'. Lavrov claims he did not realise that the image he had seen was actually of gates put up in 1937 around one of the Nazi's first concentration camps in Buchenwald, near the central German town of Weimar. He said: 'I didn't know what the words Jedem Das Seine meant, but I looked it up and found it meant ""To each his own"". 'I like the phrase because this is my garden and it's for me and that's why I used it.' 'I didn't know what the words meant': A Russian businessman who erected this garden fence that looks just like the gate that surrounded the Buchenwald concentration camp has denied he is anti-Semitic . Nestor Lavrov claims he did not realise that the design he had seen online was actually of gates put up around one of the  first Nazi concentration camps in Buchenwald, near the German town of Weima (above) The phrase has been an idiomatic German expression for centuries and, among other examples, appears in the title of a composition by Johann Sebastian Bach. It was not uncommon for the Nazis to put propaganda slogans over their concentration camps of which the most famous was Arbeit Macht Frei (work makes you free) that was put above the gates in concentration camps like Dachau and Sachsenhausen. Local officials in Russia have declined to act despite being made aware of the fact that the fence has been put up in the Istrinsky District in western Russia's Moscow Oblast region. A spokesman for authorities said: 'He put the sign up on his own property and because he insists it is not anti-Semitic, there is nothing that can be done.' The businessman is not the first to use the expression and then claim they did not know its historical context. Walk to freedom: Inmates of the German concentration camp Buchenwald near Weimar, Germany, march to receive treatment at an American hospital after the camp is liberated in April 1945 . Several modern advertising campaigns in the German language, including ads for Nokia, REWE grocery stores, Burger King, and Merkur Bank have been marred by controversy after using the phrase Jedem das Seine or Jedem den Seinen. An ExxonMobil advert campaign in January 2009 also touted Tchibo coffee drinks at the company's Esso stores with the slogan 'Jedem den Seinen!' The adverts were withdrawn after protest from the Central Council of Jews in Germany, although a company spokesman said its advertising contractor had been unaware of the proverb's association with Nazism. In March 2009, a student group associated with the Christian Democratic Union used the slogan for an education campaign in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany, but later withdrew it due to public outcry.","Nestor Lavrov commissioned fence after seeing gate design on website .

"A teenage rape victim fought back tears in court as the man who killed her six-year-old brother who tried to defend her was jailed for 110 years. Amber Andujar, 14, was defiant in the New Jersey courtroom where Osvaldo Rivera, 35, was given the sentence for a catalog of crimes including murder, attempted murder and aggravated sexual assault. Rivera sliced open the throat of Dominick Andujar, six, who tried to stop the attack after he broke into their home in Camden, New Jersey in September 2012. Scroll down for video . Survivor: Amber Andujar, 14, fought back tears in a New Jersey courtroom Thursday as her rapist was jailed for 110 years. Osvaldo Rivera, 35, killed her six-year-old brother and slashed her throat during an attack two years ago. She still bears the scars . Guilty: Rivera, pictured left in a police mugshot and right in a local news report, was given a 110-year sentence. He had rejected an earlier plea bargain which would have seen him jailed for 65 years if he pleaded guilty . Heroic: Dominick Andujar, pictured above, tried to stop Rivera during the attack, but was killed . 'Forever our hero: Dominick's mother, Debbie, lays a wreath on the grave of Dominick . Jailed: Rivera, pictured above weeping at a 2012 hearing, was convicted of crimes including murder, attempted murder and aggravated sexual assault. He showed no emotion at the sentencing this week . Together: Dominick and his sister pose for a family photograph . He was raping Amber, then 12, in a downstairs living room while holding a knife to her throat when Dominick intervened. She tried to escape after he attacked, but Rivera also slashed her throat - though she survived. Speaking in court, Amber was close to tears as she confronted Rivera, the Courier Post reported. She said: 'Today I stand here as a survivor. Even though he took a part of me away, in the end, you did not win.' Rivera, bound with a chain round his waist and wearing a deep red shirt, did not speak or show any sign of emotion at the hearing, according to NJ.com. He had earlier been offered a 65-year sentence in exchange for an admission of guilt, but he instead pleaded not guilty, and has denied involvement in the crime. His sentence means he will not be eligible for parole for 91 years. See more family reaction at The Courier Post .

Memorial: Amber wore a picture of Dominick, labelled 'My Lil Hero' on the back of her jacket at the hearing . Rivera fled the scene of the attack after killing Dominick. Amber was later seen running through the neighborhood, screaming for help while bleeding from the throat. Emergency responders said the cuts were so deep they could see Amber's vocal cords. She later helped officers track down her rapist by telling them he was known by the nickname Popeye and lived in a Camden apartment. Police tracked him down to an apartment in the city and found him hiding between an upturned mattress and the wall. Response: Police cars gather around the house where the rape and murder took place . Capture: Rivera was found hiding behind a mattress in a home in Camden after the attack . Outside the hearing, the Andujar spoke of their grief, and said Rivera's lengthy sentences gives them some solace. Tiarra, one of Dominick's sisters, said: 'Grown men wouldn't do what Dominick did that day. 'He's our soldier and will forever be in our hearts until the day we die.' His mother, Debbie Burgos, said: '[Rivera] is a coward, a big coward that does not take responsibility for what he did. He knows what he did. '[Dominick was] A little six-year-old boy, a baby just preparing to go to school. Two days before he was going to start school we were preparing for a funeral.'","Amber Andujar, 14, appeared in New Jersey courtroom to face her attacker .

"Brazilian police solved a gangland execution after stopping a teenager for speeding, and discovering horrific footage of the killing on his mobile phone. Motorist Levon Valencia Puga, 16, was found to have no driving licence and was driving a car that did not belong to him, and as a result police decided to arrest him and take him in for questioning. But back at the police station when they checked his mobile phone, they found a video which showed the shocking execution of another teenager who was killed for apparently being a snitch. Scroll down for video . Horrific: Footage police found on a mobile phone shows Marcos Vinicius Caixeta Monteiro being executed, with one of the suspects filmed stamping on his head . Shocking: The teenager tried desperately to get away but was gunned down as he fled . The killing took place in a remote area on the outskirts of the municipality of Goiania . Executed: The boy is shot at point-blank range in the head . The shocking video shows teenager Marcos Vinicius Caixeta Monteiro, 18, in the back of a car with three other men. The car has been identified as Monteiro's own vehicle, and he had apparently been forced into the back by the trio who are then seen driving to a remote area on the outskirts of the municipality of Goiania, in the central Brazilian state of Goias. The teenager looks extremely worried after the trio tell him he is going to die because he is a snitch, and had given information to police that led to a criminal being arrested. When the car stops, he climbs out and tries to run away from the vehicle off-camera before three shots ring out. Cold-blooded: The clip shows a hand gun being loaded with bullets . Scared: Monteiro looks extremely worried as the men tell him that he is going to die for being a snitch . The video then shows one of the three men walking up to the young man lying on the ground, who is clutching his head, and stamping on him repeatedly. They then reload the gun before a second man shoots him point-blank range in the head, with at least one of the bullets missing and thudding into the earth. They then walk back to the car, discussing everything calmly as if nothing has happened. Puga is heard on the video saying: 'Go with God'. A police spokesman confirmed the arrest and said they were still trying to identify and arrest the other two men shown in the video. Local police chief Kleyton Manoel Dias said: 'One of the most shocking things about this case is that the arrested driver really didn't seem bothered when the video was discovered. He was completely calm and described what happened, and gave all the detail we wanted without showing any emotion at all.' The family of the dead teenager meanwhile said they wanted justice and added: 'He did not deserve to die like this.'

"Britain saw its coldest evening since last winter's cold snap as temperatures plunged to -5C (23F) overnight, with more freezing temperatures forecast for today. Forecasters said temperatures are likely to remain cold this week, with a chance snow could fall in parts of the North and South West by Friday as Britain is set to become even colder. However evidence of the mild weather of the last few months, which has put 2014 on course to be the warmest ever, still remain after  daffodils were spotted growing in the UK and grapes were seen on the vine as winter officially started. Scroll down for video . A heavy frost was seen in the Lake District this morning after the coldest temperatures since last winter were recorded overnight in Cumbria . There were snowy scenes along the River Brathay in Cumbria today as walkers braced themselves for more cold and possible snow on Friday . Despite temperatures plunging to below zero in Scotland this week, grapes were found growing on the side of a house in Edinburgh. While in Lincolnshire the official start of winter was marked by a daffodil blooming in a garden. The mercury plunged to -5.1C (22.6F) in Shap in Cumbria last night - the coldest temperature of this year's autumn and winter season, which officially started on December 1. It was even colder than in Scotland, which saw -4.1C recorded in Aboyne, a village on the edge if the Scottish highlands, overnight, and saw walkers enjoy the first deep snow of winter in the Cairngorms in the east Highlands yesterday. Elsewhere in the country extra blankets and hats were needed to deal with the cold snap, with -2.6C (27F) recorded in Bala in North Wales and -1.3C (30F) in Okehampton in West Devon overnight. London was substantially warmer, with temperatures of around 2.5C overnight, with similar expected this evening. However Thursday night is expected to be even colder for much of the country, and forecasters said there was a 'slim chance' snow could fall in parts of the Pennines and North Wales by the end of this week. There is also a possibility of wintry showers in exposed areas of the south as the mercury is expected to dip to as low as -2C (28F) during the day in Bristol on Friday. And a minimum temperature of -5C (23F) is forecast for the Oxfordshire village of Benson overnight, according to the Met Office. As the mercury plunged to -2C in Scotland, grapes were spotted growing on the side of a house where philosopher Thomas Carlyle once lived . Mike Williamson said he was shocked to discover grapes, which he planted 15 years ago, were growing up the side of his Edinburgh home . In Lincolnshire Marilyn Fenn found a daffodil blooming in her garden three months earlier and just after the official start of winter for the UK . Temperatures fell on Tuesday night after a warm weekend which saw giant cobwebs emerge in fields across Jersey. Warm temperatures on Saturday led to millions of spiders taking advantage of the mild conditions to move from one place to another using huge gossamer webs . Environmentalists said the appearance of the large webs was 'incredibly rare' and had been spun by millions of money spiders on Saturday . Nicola Maxey, a forecaster for the Met Office, said: 'On higher ground in the South there's a chance that we might see some sleet, and a slim chance of snow on Friday.' Cloudy and breezy weather is forecast today, with a chance of showers throughout the day as a weak weather front moves across the country. Tomorrow is expected to be much more cloudy and grey, with a chance of showers in the South East and Midlands which may turn to sleet by Friday. Ms Maxey added: 'These showers could turn a bit wintry in exposed areas such as in Newcastle and the Pennines, but accumulations are unlikely. There is also a risk of fog patches.' After a heavy frost there were snowy scenes this morning as photographers beat the cold temperatures and wrapped up warm in Cumbria . Last night's cold snap made way for clear and calm skies this morning and a stunning early morning sunrise over River Brathay in Cumbria . As Cumbria is bracing itself for temperatures well below freezing, the heavy frost this morning was reflected in Elterwater in the Lake District . Picture postcard scenes of snow covered trees were seen in the Lake District after Shap in Cumbria recorded winter's coldest temperature . However traces of the mild months of 2014 remain after Mike Williamson discovered huge bunches of white grapes flourishing on the side of his Edinburgh home, where Thomas Carlyle lived in the 1820s. Mr Williamson planted the grapes 15 years ago and only discovered they were growing when a window cleaner visited the home he shares with his wife Hil, 64, this week. He said: 'We do have grapes on it every year as the wall is south facing and there is good soil so it grows very well especially in this beautiful year we've had. The grapevines are mostly just in our garden for decoration and, I must admit, we don't really pay too much attention to it.' Experts said the appearance of the grapes was unusual, but can be explained following our warm summer and unseasonably mild autumn. A car in the Peak District was covered with frost this morning and motorists are being warned to be careful as more cold weather is expected . The cold snap made for clear skies and picturesque sunrises in the Peak District, but people are being warned to brace themselves tonight . Gritters were out on the A66 Trans Pennine route tonight as temperatures are expected to dip further, making driving conditions dangerous . In Lincolnshire, where temperatures have also plunged this week, grandmother Marilyn Fenn spotted a lone daffodil growing in her garden in Woodhall Spa. The daffodil, traditionally seen in Spring, has appeared three months early despite the freezing temperatures of this week. Others have also reported seeing snowdrops in their garden, which also usually appear in spring. This year is set to be the warmest on record after every month so far except August was warmer than the average. Warm temperatures at the weekend also saw thousands of spider webs cover the countryside in Jersey. As unseasonably high temperatures of hit 16C money spiders spun thousands of webs - called gossamers - to migrate from one place to another. Local environmentalist Mike Stentiford said is was extremely rare to see the webs appear over such a wide area. Last night's freezing night in the Peak District made for pink skies as the son rose and fields covered with frost as winter gets off to a cold start . Thursday is expected to be a particularly wet day, with cooler temperatures meaning showers could turn into sleet and light snow showers . People in Cumbria (left) are to prepare for another freezing evening tonight, while sheep were in frosty fields near Roseberry Topping, a hill on the border between North Yorkshire and Redcar and Cleveland (right), where temperatures dropped to -2C overnight on Tuesday . He said: 'It is just literally squillions of tiny money spiders and it is their way of moving from one place to another. We normally get it in one or two fields but it seemed to me that the whole of the island was absolutely covered with it. It was absolutely amazing.' However a cold December could threaten that record, as forecasters say frost is expected this week. Friday is expected to be a wetter and windier day, with stronger winds forecast for the North West. In the South East milder conditions are expected, with temperatures back to the average for December. Walkers in the Cairngorms, dubbed the snowiest place in Britain in a recent Met Office survey, enjoyed the first snow of winter yesterday as they trudged through deep snow, leading to hopes of a white Christmas for the UK this year. People in Edinburgh woke up to a crisp morning and a pretty sun rise from Arthur's Seat to Edinburgh Castle after the mercury plunged to -4C . The sunrise in Edinburgh this morning created a perfect silhouette for Edinburgh's skyline as people woke after a freezing cold night . In Leeds light frost covered Roundhay Park this morning after the mercury plunged to below zero overnight and another cold night is forecast . A supply vessel moved past Aberdeen Harbour this morning, the only movement among the clear skies of a freezing early morning . People in Aberdeen this morning woke up to a bright red sunrise, accompanied by freezing temperatures as the mercury is set to fall . The snow in Scotland led to warnings being issued by police about the dangers of driving on the A939 in the Cairngorms because of the recent snow and ice. And with forecasts of snow for the rest of England, comes a warning about the dangers and health risks of plunging temperatures. The onset of the colder weather has led Public Health England to think about their health during the cold snap - 25,000 extra people usually die in England during winter, with the elderly particularly vulnerable. The sunrise over Aberdeen harbour showed clear skies as earlier risers walked their dogs and caught the sight along the coast this morning . Aberdeen is set to become even colder as the Cairngorms saw the first snow of winter yesterday, and temperatures plunged to -4C overnight . A recent study by the Met Office found that snow has fallen 38 times in the last 52 years - meaning we can expect around half of our Christmases to be 'white.' However the traditional festive image of trees dusted in white, is more likely to be confined to Christmas cards. Snow settling on the ground is much rarer, and has happened just four times in the last 51 years. Commuters will also be hopeful that the Christmas season will not be a repeat of last year, when parts of England were drenched by heavy rain - leaving large parts of the Somerset Levels submerged for months.","Coldest temperatures since last year were recorded last night as the mercury plunged to -5.1C in Cumbria .

"The defendant (pictured outside Blackfriars Crown Court today), from north London, denies one charge of stalking and one charge of sexual assault . A television personality was sent sinister emails about the murder of Jill Dando from a stalker who later gave her a 'sloppy kiss' outside the O2 arena, a court heard today. The woman received hundreds of messages from the man, with some referring to domestic abuse and Ms Dando's murder. Other messages suggested she leave her husband to marry him and have his child. The woman, who is a household name but cannot be named for legal reason, was subjected to a campaign of harassment over social media and email for more than a year during which the man, who also cannot be named, claimed they were having a 'cyber affair'. The trial at Blackfriars Crown Court today heard how the harassment even saw the defendant visit the TV studios where the woman worked to deliver gifts. It culminated in him kissing her at a public event. Max Hardy, prosecuting, said: 'This case concerns obsessive behaviour on the part of the defendant directed towards a television presenter. 'This obsessive behaviour manifested itself in the defendant's use of the social network site Twitter, in email communications and attending at her workplace and written communication to her address. 'That behaviour went far beyond the respectful enthusiasm of a fan. 'He caused her significant alarm or distress that had a substantial effect on her day-to-day life.' The court heard how the defendant began contacting the celebrity about her programmes and she replied out of courtesy, although the messages then became increasingly personal. The presenter, who is in her 40s, made a statement to police in December last year, shortly before the man was arrested. Mr Hardy said: 'She recalled the first communication from him being a tweet sent in January 2012. 'She had just been on television and the tweet was saying ""you look lovely I simply have to say so"".' She began receiving emails to her work address, again replying to the messages out of respect for her fans. The messages took another turn in February 2012, when the man began speaking about his personal issues and invited her to go the David Hockney exhibition at the Royal Academy in London. In the March of the same year, his messages took a sinister turn with an email referring to a segment on Claire's Law, which was brought in to help victims of violent domestic abuse. He also attached the first chapters of his autobiography and his mobile number asking for her to call him. She stopped replying to the messages, but days later, on March 15, he wrote to her again with the chilling reference to murdered presenter Jill Dando. Mr Hardy said: 'The email contained a transcript purporting to be a telephone call from someone called Sue and he referred to the discovery that Jill Dando, the TV presenter, had been murdered.' The Crimewatch presenter was shot dead, aged 37, outside her home in Fulham, west London, in April 1999. Mr Hardy continued: '[He wrote] 'I hope that wan't too freaky a start to the day, don't let it be s***e, that's like a one-in-a-million thing anyway. (sic)' The email was passed on to the station's security and he was blocked from emailing any of its email address. Blackfriars Crown Court (pictured) heard how the woman was subjected to a campaign of harassment over social media and email for more than a year during which the man claimed they were having a 'cyber affair' However, he continued to message her through third parties, the court heard. Another email, sent in March 2012, described his love for her and blamed a co-presenter for being blocked from the email system. Mr Hardy said: '[The email] is a declaration of love and adoration for her and suggests that she divorces her husband, marries him and they could have a child together.' He carried on contacting the woman saying they were having a 'cyber affair' and invited her to use an anonymous messaging system. The court heard that although the harassment began in early 2012, he stands charged with the crimes from November that year, when stalking became a criminal offence. Jurors were told the alleged stalker was not accused of threatening violence against the celebrity, although his obsessive communication caused her 'serious alarm or distress'. The court also heard how in December 2012, he visited the TV studios where she worked to deliver hand-warmers and a Christmas card and letter, but was turned away. The celebrity chose to go to the police after the defendant approached her at an event at the O2 and kissed her, jurors were told. Mr Hardy said: 'He thrust a copy of a programme into her hands and asked her for an autograph then, in her words, ""landed a sloppy wet kiss on my cheek"". 'She tried to shrug it off but over time decided to take it to the police. 'That's what prompted her to install further security measures and alter her activities.' The alleged stalker, from north London, denies one charge of stalking and one charge of sexual assault. The trial continues.

"A judge is issuing an arrest warrant for a 77-year-old Utah man who police say was sunbathing nude in his backyard next to a Mormon church parking lot. Court records show the $5,000 cash-only warrant was issued Tuesday after Myron Lee Kipp failed to show up at a court hearing in his lewdness case. Kipp has pleaded not guilty to seven misdemeanor counts of lewdness, four involving a child. According to a probable cause statement, police were called to Kipp's home on March 5 after witnesses saw him sunbathing naked in his backyard. According to public records, Kipp owns a home on East 200 N Road, next to the Farmington Chapel Mormon church . Not suitable for church: An arrest warrant has been issued to a Utah man who was charged with lewdness for sunbathing nude in his backyard, in view of adults and children standing in an adjacent church parking lot . Those witnesses included three adults and four children standing in the adjacent parking lot of the chapel. Kipp was allegedly visible since he had a chain link fence with no privacy slats. When police confronted Kipp, he told an officer 'he was sun bathing and that it was his property and he could do it if he wanted,' the record states. That's when police forced Kipp to dress, arrested him and took him to jail. Defense attorney William Albright didn't immediately return a message seeking comment.

"The winner of the Miss World pageant has addressed the historic Oxford Union debating chamber to tearfully clarify that beauty queens cannot save the planet. Megan Young, who was crowned Miss World 2013, became tearful as she addressed some of the sharpest minds in student academics to defend pageants against critics of the industry who say they demean women. She told the prestigious union, which has hosted Nelson Mandela, Albert Einstein, Mother Teresa,  and the Dalai Lama: 'People are saying you're Miss World you should save the world, and to be honest, we can't really save the world as a whole, we're doing it part by part.

She addressed the historic Oxford Union debating chamber to say that it was hard, but that beauty queens cannot save the planet . Ms Young, who was crowned when she represented the country of her mother's birth, the Philippines, was helped at the debate by competitors for the Miss World 2014 title - including Miss England, Carina Tyrrell, who is a final year medicine student at Cambridge University. Before the discussion, Tyrrell defended the competition from criticism that women are judged more on their looks rather than their brains. 'You are surrounded by women who represent their countries. These are role models, they are role models to young women and role models to society.' Before she spoke to the crowd, Miss Young and this year's contestants were given a tour of the University's centuries-old buildings, where some of the world's most celebrated scientists, writers and academic minds have studied.

She identifies problems and she finds solutions. She changes the world,' said Miss United States, Elizabeth Safrit. The contestants then fielded questions from students and Miss Young became quite emotional as she recalled what the hardest part of being Miss World has been. 'And what... it hurts really, it really does hurt and sometimes you just can't help but cry. I'm sorry I'm getting really emotional because you know I've been through so many countries and it's just so difficult seeing them in this position and you know people are saying you're Miss World you should save the world, and to be honest, we can't really save the world as a whole, we're doing it part by part. We're not Superman. We're human too.' Getting some tips: This year's contestants meet the current Miss World as the competition returns to London . After the debate the Miss World contestants and students left the Union. But some were left feeling flat by the level of debate. Oxford University student, Kate Welsh, said: 'I was a bit disappointed that it didn't have more of a debate, wasn't formed throughout the evening, perhaps, on the kind of moral issues behind having what's still fundamentally a beauty pageant. 'And having women from such privileged backgrounds being supposedly representative of their countries,' said'All of us here just came to prove that it's a lot more than just pretty faces behind us.

"A group of pranksters' comedy 'gangsta' sketch went horribly wrong after police mistook their toy guns for real ones. The four men had been filming a stunt in Enfield, London, for their Intagram and You Tube pages which involved two of the group brandishing the fake guns before holding them to their friend's neck. But the joke quickly backfired after a member of the public mistook the toys for real weapons and reported them to police. The camera was still rolling when armed officers arrive shouting at them to 'Drop the gun, drop the gun.' The group of pranksters hold the fake guns to their friend's neck as part of their comedy 'gangsta' stunt . But the sketch quickly becomes very real for the four men after police are called and order them to lie on the ground and surrender their weapons . The friends attempt to explain they are filming and the guns were fake but the officer forces them to lie down on the ground and surrender their weapons. He can then be heard reporting to a back up team saying: 'Four recovered - at least two firearms.' Police confirmed that armed officers had attended and arrested the group who were later released without charge. The three minute clip has now been viewed almost 300,000 times since it was added on November 30. One of the stunt men, who posted the clip on YouTube on November 30, wrote: ''We was filming a short sketch for my Instagram page, using plastic toy guns as props. A member of public must of saw us and called the police. The video has split opinion online over the police's response. Lauren Cassinia wrote on the YouTube video's comments: 'That was excessive. They dropped their guns as soon as they were asked to and everyone but the cameraman got on the floor when asked. 'There was no need for the language either. All it would have taken was a quick check once they'd been handcuffed and it would have been so much less violent. But then it's understandable for the police to be scared since they don't have guns.' But Gustaf Smythe-Richards added that: 'Guns aren't toys.' YouTube user MadSaltySkills wrote: 'In America they would of got shot with no question asked lol.' Dale Of Hope added: 'In the cops defense... If they treated every situation with exposed firearms as 'they're probably just filming', we'd have a lot of dead people on our hands. So I'm glad they took the 'better safe than sorry' route.' 'Rightly so. Especially with all the stuff going on over in the states. 'We should have been more responsible. Definitely pooped myself a bit tho haha! 'Let this a lesson to everyone, don't play with plastic guns in public.' (sic). Possession of imitation and toy firearms can in certain circumstances amount to a criminal offence. The four men, all in their late twenties and early thirties, were arrested on November 29 at around 2pm. Another member of the group posted on Instagram: 'What a mad day... can't lie tho I was shook and fully nearly lost my life if I held the gun any longer I was a goner. 'All for me and my boys filmin a robbery sketch for Insta.' (sic) A spokeswoman for London Metropolitan Police said without officers knowing if the guns were real or fake they had to follow protocol. 'Four men aged 27, 28, 30 and 30 were arrested at the scene and taken to an east London police Station,' she added. 'Two imitation firearms were recovered at the scene. 'All suspects were interviewed and provided the same account. They explained that they were using the imitation guns to make a film. 'The suspects showed remorse and were later released with no further action being taken.' The four men, all in their late twenties and early thirties, were arrested on November 29 at around 2pm .

"While opposition leader Bill Shorten continues to criticise the Abbott government's policies, he was unable to reveal how his party plans on dealing with Australia's economic challenges. Mr Shorten declined to go into specifics, in an interview on Wednesday night with Leigh Sales on ABC's 7.30 program, saying he couldn't provide 'a three-word slogan' just yet. Despite this, he reiterated his one solution for the nation as: 'go for growth' but failed to further elaborate. Although he admits there is an 'appetite' among Australians to hear some of Labor's policies, he was adamant they were not going to be unveiled until 2015.

"There is no doubting the skill and craftsmanship of his artwork. But Simon Beck’s masterpieces aren’t created with a paintbrush or easel. Instead, the 56-year-old’s canvases are the sprawling ski slopes of the Alps, and he creates his intricate patterns by running in snowshoes across the snow. Scroll down for video . Simon Beck has spent the past decade decorating the mountain range with his spectacular artworks, which can measure up to 100m x 100m – the size of two football pitches . The artist has spent the past decade decorating the mountain range with his spectacular artworks, which can measure up to 100m x 100m – the size of six football pitches. It means that Mr Beck can cover a total of more than 25 miles during each piece of work. Each image takes up to 12 hours to design and make, with Simon currently produces about 30 snow drawing each year. His work has also led him to publish a book of his designs, inspired an underwear range, and seen him branch out into etching drawings on beaches. Each image takes up to 11 hours to design and make, with Simon currently produces about 30 snow drawing each year . His work has also led Simon to publish a book of his designs, inspired an underwear range, and seen him branch out into etching drawings on beaches . The artist favours a level site with a depth of about nine inches of powdery snow to make sure his art looks best in photographs, which he takes from either an aircraft, summit or a ski lift . His most intricate designs include the Koch snowflake, a Sierpinski triangle as well as abstract cubes and spirals. He uses an orienteering compass to create the perfect geometric designs. Each pattern is crafted by Mr Beck alone in the skiing town of Les Arcs, in the French Alps, where he lives during winter. Mr Beck, went to Millfield School and studied engineering at Oxford university. In 1974 he won the British Orienteering Championships. He has spent most of his adult life working as a freelance orienteering mapmaker and has now created around 175 designs after ploughing his first at Christmas in 2004. His most intricate designs include the Koch snowflake, a Sierpinski triangle as well as abstract cubes and spirals. He uses an orienteering compass to create the perfect geometric designs . Mr Beck, who studied Engineering Science at Oxford University, said many of his patterns can equal the effort needed to climb halfway up Mont Blanc . His work has proved so popular that New Zealand clothes label Icebreaker launched The Art of Nature Simon Beck Collection – a range of undergarments inspired by his designs. He uses what he describes as a 'kind of reverse orienteering' to plot his intricate paths before walking along the route in a pair of snowshoes. Most of Mr Beck's patterns are crafted in the skiing town of Les Arcs, in the French Alps, where he lives during winter . He said: 'The main reason for making them was because I can no longer run properly due to problems with my feet, so plodding about on level snow is the least painful way of getting exercise. Mr Beck said many of his patterns can equal the effort needed to climb halfway up Mont Blanc. He first plans out the pattern on graph paper, then surveys the site and judges where the major points of the design should be, and starts at one of those points. From the centre he calculates the distance to the other points and walks out and back from the centre using either pace counting or a measuring tape to determine the number of steps he needs to take. The artist favours a level site with a depth of about nine inches of powdery snow to make sure his art looks best in photographs, which he takes from either an aircraft, summit or a ski lift. The designs only last until the next heavy snowfall. He added: 'I usually keep at it until I get too tired, using a headlamp if it gets dark first. It takes typically until I can't go on, but that can depend. 'The setting-out serves as the warm-up then the real training is completing the design. Once this second stage is started, I put on my personal stereo.' The artist from Bracknell, Berkshire added: 'Most of the time I travel round the Alps and hike up mountains, aiming to be on the summit at sunset for good photos. ‘My feet are in a bad way but if I can keep my weight off the front of my feet things are not too bad. 'Often I am copying designs I have found, like crop circles or well-known mathematical figures, or repeating designs I have made earlier but failed to get good photos of. 'Some designs I am commissioned to do require a lot of study as to the best way to create it, and this process can take several hours. ‘The main danger is having a minor accident skiing down at night after I have finished drawing. ‘Or running out of steam, if you push yourself too hard at the end of it. It is quite frightening how quickly you can run out of steam.’ More of Mr Beck's work can be seen on his Facebook page at www.facebook.com/snowart8848 .","British artist Simon Beck, 56, spends 11 hours creating his masterpieces .

"A domestic worker in South Africa is just two rounds away from wining the prestigious Masterchef title, while raising awareness of the 'forgotten army' of servants working in the nation's homes. Siphokazi Mdlankomo, 39, from Cape Town, is one of the favourites to win the competition after judges quickly recognised her ability to cook and balance flavours. Ms Mdlankomo, who is known as Sipho' on the show will take on a former advertising executive, a train driving assistant  and a life skills lecturer in the show's semi-final. Scroll down for video . Siphokazi Mdlankomo, pictured, has reached the semi-finals of the South African Masterchef competition . The domestic worker, centre, has amazed the show's judges and received massive support from the public . According to South African television station DSTV: 'Sipho, a domestic worker from Cape Town, is the embodiment of the popular adage that “dynamite comes in small packages”. This pint-sized cook is out to prove that domestic workers are not second-class citizens; that their role in South African households should be held in equal regard to any other profession out there. 'On her first day in boot camp, Sipho had to think on her feet when her original plan of making a consommé didn’t work out – but she kept her cool and made a beautiful aioli to accompany her perfectly pan-fried angelfish. 'On Day 2, she displayed an impressive skills base once again by making a succulent parma wrapped chicken breast with cauliflower mash and Provencale sauce. The judges quickly noticed that Siphokazi’s talents lie in her vast knowledge of different cooking styles – from classic to modern – coupled with the ability to combine and balance flavours effortlessly.' In South Africa, one in six working women are in domestic service and many of those are black people working in white households. The judges have been wowed by some of her creations, pictured, and her ability to balance delicate flavours . Speaking in advance of her latest challenge on Thursday, Ms Mdlankomo said: 'Being a domestic worker is just like any other job, which you should be proud of doing. It is a profession from which you earn your income. There are many domestic workers out there, who like me, have hidden secrets, talents and passion. No job should prevent you from following your dream.' According to The Guardian, Ms Mdlankomo has been with her employer Liz Andreasen for the past nine years. Ingrid Engelbrecht, a spokeswoman for Masterchef SA, said: 'People have loved her from the start. It’s an inspirational story. 'Many people have domestic workers who are considered part of the family, but domestic workers have never been showcased on television. 'Siphokazi’s story is the same as millions in South Africa who are raising a family and cooking for a family along with their own. Many people have been thrilled to see her on TV and doing so well.'","Siphokazi MdLankomo, 39, has reached the semi-final of Masterchef .

"This is the shocking scene that confronted a student when he discovered a car windscreen smashed to pieces by a swan. University of Hull undergraduate Tim Barrass, 20, was on his way to morning lectures when he noticed the car had been damaged. The windscreen was smashed and had buckled slightly and there was a prostrate swan lying next to it on the pavement. University of Hull undergraduate Tim Barrass was on his way into lectures when he noticed his neighbour's car had been damaged - and spotted a swan lying next to it . Mr Barrass immediately called the RSPCA who soon arrived at the scene and took the swan to a rescue centre, but so far vets have been unable to work out how the swan managed to smash into the car. They believe the swan could have collapsed mid-flight  - or may even have flown straight into the windshield. The black Renault Clio was parked on a residential street in the student area of the city. Mr Barrass, a third-year History student, told student newspaper The Tab: 'I'd only been awake for ten minutes so I rubbed my eyes to double check it [the swan] was real. 'I presumed it was dead, but then it started honking and that's when I noticed the car next to it with the windscreen smashed in. Mr Barrass said his friend Vicky Price was gutted it shattered her windscreen. He said: 'It could have thought it was a river and when it's coming down, it must be pretty hard for a big bird like that to stop. 'It must have been a pretty hard impact, it was a big thing too. I know you get birds flying into windows but it shouldn't have hit a car. 'When I saw the damage I went round ringing on all the houses to see whose car it was because the owner might have thought someone had vandalised their car. 'When I realised it was Vicky's car, I told her. She was gutted.' He added: 'She lives on the next street over but parked on our road because there were no spaces. 'She said the windscreen is a total right off - it's just bad luck.' RSPCA vets put the swan down because its injuries were so severe- they have not been able to find out out if the bird fell or flew into the car (pictured are the RSPCA headquarters in Horsham, West Sussex) 'Trying to be Sherlock I deduced it must have fallen onto the car and bounced off.' An RSPCA spokesman said: 'We were called to an incident in Hull where an adult swan had fallen from the sky and crashed in to a car windscreen on Tuesday morning.' The swan's chest injuries were so severe vets were unable to find the original reason for the swan's collapse. The representative added: 'Sadly the injuries the swan sustained in the fall were very severe and on vets advice he was put to sleep. 'It is a mystery as to why this happened and the only thing we can put it down to is exhaustion.' The Queen's swan keeper said the may have mistaken the wet road for a river in the sun's early morning glint. Professor Chris Perrins, who has been Her Majesty's Warden of the Swans since 1993, said: 'Especially in dawn and dusk they mistake the wet road for a river and try and land on it. 'At this time of year when the sun's low and the roads are wet the RSPCA and swan rescuers get called out quite regularly to roads where they have crashed. 'They shouldn't fly into cars but it can happen.' As the first person to be the Warden of the Swans he has met the Queen several times and is in charge of the annual Swan Upping, where the birds are counted in a census. The former Oxford researcher added: 'They are at the top end of the limits for a flying bird they can only take off really slowly and they don't have much ability for sudden manoeuvres. 'When the sun's coming up or going down and it's wet, the road can have a glint. That's my bet for what happened.' Mr Barass, who shares his home with five other students, added: 'I rang my flatmates after the RPSCA, they don't usually get out of bed until ten but they woke up straight away when they got the phone call from me. 'They saw the photo and thought it was totally bizarre.'","Student Tim Barrass on his way to morning lectures when he spotted swan .

"the Lib Dem Business Secretary attacked the Tories’ economic plans, which involve slicing another £24billion from public spending . Vince Cable has publicly denounced George Osborne’s plans to slash the budget deficit within four years, and urged his party to oppose ‘brutal’ spending cuts. In an extraordinary intervention which puts further strain on the Coalition, the Lib Dem Business Secretary attacked the Tories’ economic plans, which involve slicing another £24billion from public spending during the next Parliament. He claimed whichever party is in power next year will have to raise taxes, and even said he agreed with Labour that the next government should borrow more. Mr Cable said he ‘did not recognise’ the Chancellor’s plan to eliminate the deficit and run a surplus by 2018-19. He also said: ‘We do have differences in emphasis. The Tories would like to cut spending rather more brutally than we think is necessary or desirable.’ His attack came as his party’s leader Nick Clegg shunned the Autumn Statement yesterday. In a highly unusual move, the Deputy Prime Minister chose to stay away – and instead flew 300 miles to Penzance to talk to locals about flood defences. Senior Lib Dems have warned him that he needs to distance himself from the Tories in the run up to the General Election – though Mr Clegg insisted his decision was not a snub. Mr Cable confirmed he had asked the Office for Budget Responsibility to map out a different forecast for the Lib Dems which contained fewer spending cuts. He added ‘all parties will have to increase taxation whether they say so or not’. On eliminating the deficit, he told LBC Radio: ‘I’m not sure I recognise the figures and the dates you are talking about. The budget deficit also includes borrowing for capital investment. ‘We think if there are good capital investments … for infrastructure and the government earns a proper return for the taxpayer, we should invest in it.’ Asked if this meant he agreed with Labour’s Ed Balls, he replied: ‘We do agree with them on that particular issue, and we differ from the Tories.’ Government sources said Mr Cable had ‘erupted’ yesterday morning and told fellow Lib Dems, including Chief Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander, that they had not signed up to the Conservatives’ spending plans beyond the general election. Mr Cable said he ‘did not recognise’ Chancellor George Osborne’s (pictured) plan to eliminate the deficit and run a surplus by 2018-19. On air, Mr Cable said the Lib Dems were committed to the deficit reduction plans until May. He denied he had ordered his civil servants not to co-operate with Treasury officials. Tory backbencher Andrew Rosindell said: ‘I don’t think any sensible person believes borrowing more money is the right approach for the country.’ Mr Alexander also distanced himself, saying: ‘It’s not the job of the Office for Budget Responsibility to set out the differences between parties.’ Mr Clegg said his decision to stay away from the Chancellor’s speech was ‘not a snub’, but ‘a nice change to get out of the Westminster bubble and say what this Autumn Statement means to people’.","Vince Cable's attack on Tories will further strain  Coalition relations .

"After a week of wild weather experienced throughout the country, Victorian residents have taken to social media to mock the overturned lawn chairs and rattling windows caused by two minor earthquakes felt in Melbourne. After two people were struck by lightning in Sydney as ferocious storms swept through NSW, Victorians had their own spate of natural phenomena, dubbed by locals as '#MelbourneQuake2014'. The underwhelming experience of the 3.2 magnitude earthquake just after 6am on Thursday prompted social media users to declare a 'We will rebuild' campaign, posting pictures of minor inconveniences caused by the quake. Scroll down for video . The underwhelming experience of the 3.2 magnitude earthquake just after 6am on Thursday prompted social media users to declare a 'We will rebuild' campaign . After two people were struck by lightning in Sydney as ferocious storms swept through NSW, Victorians had their own spate of natural phenomena, dubbed by locals as '#MelbourneQuake2014' Geoscience Australia seismologists confirmed that the quake struck the Melbourne suburbs of Pakenham and Berwick, 56 kilometers from the CBD, with some residents woken up by the shake, but many more residents reported thinking the earthquake was thunder. Many residents living right in the epicentre reported sleeping through the incident or barely registering that a seismological current was running through their suburb. One resident posted a picture on Facebook of an overturned lawn chair with the caption 'we will rebuild', with other users accusing friends' movements for making the ground shake, or suggesting the quake was caused by a resident sending out 'good vibes'. Other social media users suggested that the rumble may have been a result of locals sexual activity, 'rocking beds' and 'shaking the suburb'. Social media users were quick to claim that they had 'been part of Quake Wake 2014', posting sarcastic comments about 'living through' the Thursday morning earthquake . Many residents living right in the epicentre reported sleeping through the incident or barely registering that a seismological current was running through their suburb . An 'I survived the Berwick earthquake' Facebook page was reportedly started, using a photograph of an overturned lawn chair captured in a similarly minor earthquake from 2012 . Social media users were quick to claim that they had 'been part of Quake Wake 2014', posting sarcastic comments about 'living through' the Thursday morning earthquake. 'Horrific tales of lattes being spilt in Pakenham, stay strong Melbourne we'll get through this together' said one Twitter user. An 'I survived the Berwick earthquake' Facebook page was reportedly started, using a photograph of an overturned lawn chair captured in a similarly minor earthquake from 2012. Duty seismologist Marco Naldomi from Geoscience Australia said that there had been in excess of 700 reports from those living around the epicentre, but that no one had been hurt or recorded any property breakages. 'There have been no reports of damage, but people have reported couches shaking or chairs falling over,' Mr Naldomi said. 'Some residents reported hearing a bang or a loud rumble, of windows rattling, but given the population in the area it's not surprising that we've had so many reports.' The interest in the quake continued with social media users in New Zealand ridiculing the minor earthquake, commenting that Australians complaining about earthquakes was akin to Kiwi's complaining of heat waves. 'Where were you when the earthquake hit!? You know, the one that happened the day after that other one,' asked one social media user . Victorian residents have flocked to social media to mock the overturned lawn chairs and rattling windows caused by two minor earthquakes felt in Melbourne . On Wednesday morning Victoria experienced another earthquake, hitting the Gippsland suburb of Korumburra, which the seismologist said experiences quakes much more frequently. 'Where were you when the earthquake hit!? You know, the one that happened the day after that other one,' asked one social media user. Mr Naldomi said that the area of Pakenham does not often experience earthquakes, with only eight on record including the quake on Thursday morning. 'Earthquakes happen along faultlines, cracks in the earth's crust. That stress is released every now and then in form of earthquake along weaker part of faultlines,' Mr Nadomi said . 'The immediate area outside the epicentre is very seismically quiet, and today's earthquake was the largest on record,' Mr Naldomi said. 'Earthquakes happen along faultlines, cracks in the earth's crust. That stress is released every now and then in form of earthquake along weaker part of faultlines,' he said. 'From this we could infer that that there may well be a faultlines in the area but that it is minor, outside of the ring of fire in the state's south which is a much larger faultline.' 'There are much more active faultlines in the Gipsland area, but it's unlikely the two earthquakes are related.' Lightning strikes at Sydney Harbour on Wednesday afternoon as a severe thunderstorm warning is issued for a number of areas across New South Wales . Firefighters finally put out the fire about 9pm, almost three hours after it started . Earlier in the week, two people were struck by lightning as severe thunderstorms swept through Sydney causing flight chaos and traffic delays. Luckily only minor cases, a man in his 20s was hit by lightning in Hazelbrook, in the Blue Mountains while another person was struck in Cabramatta in Sydney's southwest, said an ambulance spokeswoman. The Bureau of Meteorology issued a severe thunderstorm warning on Wednesday afternoon for areas near Parramatta, Sydney Olympic Park and Richmond. The bureau warned the storm was moving towards the north east and was forecast to hit Hornsby, Sydney city, the Harbour Bridge and the northern beaches. The New South Wales capital was plunged into darkness by 5.30pm but by 7pm the worse of the storm seemed to have passed although at least 13,000 homes in the Blue Mountains, Hawkesbury, Southern Highlands and Western Sydney regions were still without power. The fire broke out just after 6.30pm on Wednesday after being struck by lightning . Dark smoke is seen billowing over the inner-city of Sydney, covering the Harbour Bridge from view . Firefighters evacuated 40 units near the substations as they waited for the power to be shut off . The commute home for many Sydneysiders was thrown into disarray with ferries stranded as they were unable to dock and traffic was brought to a standstill on the Harbour Bridge. One driver described the scene on the bridge as a 'car park'. Lightning also wreaked havoc in Pyrmont - in Sydney's inner-city - with an electrical substation catching alight after it was hit. Large amounts of dark smoke was seen billowing out of the building just after 6.30pm, but it has since been extinguished. It took 20 firefighters around two hours to put out the fire and while authorities aren't sure what caused it, they think it may have been due to lightning. The fire proved tricky for firefighters who were prevented from using water to extinguish the substation blaze as it had about 11,000 volts of electricity running through it, Superintendent Ian Krimmer said. Storms stopped traffic on the Harbour Bridge as the east coast was pelted by wild weather . Lightning strikes were seen all over Sydney as the skies fell dark across the city .

NSW SES is currently working at Mittagong, in the Southern Highlands of NSW, where 40 requests for assistance have been received after the area was flooded with 30mm of rain in only 20 minutes. According to Live Traffic NSW, five roads were flooded by 6pm, including the Great Western Highway Springwood, Old Windsor Road and Seven Hills Road. Train services were closed on the T1 Western Line between Richmond and Clarendon, 'due to lightning strikes at Clarendon affecting signalling,' Transport NSW stated. Fire and Rescue NSW had received more than 50 phone calls about fallen trees and power lines by 5:30pm . Large amounts of dark smoke was spotted billowing out of a building at Pyrmont in Sydney's centre during the storm, after lightning struck an electrical sub station and sparked a fire . Social media users instantly took to sharing photographs of the storm's affect in their area . Buses operated as a replacement service between stations, however heavy traffic in the Richmond area caused delays. There was also heavy traffic delays in Strathfield due to flooding. The storms also caused some delays to flights out of Sydney Airport with Qantas and Virgin confirming that its domestic and international runways had been closed since 5.15pm. Qantas said about 10 flights had been affected, some by up to two hours. By 7pm, a Virgin spokeswoman said its flights had returned to normal with the runways reopening. Social media users instantly took to sharing photographs of the storm's affect in their area. Further south in Mildura in Victoria, residents posted photos of hail the size of a 20-cent piece pelting the town. The Bureau of Meteorology predicted large hail stones, damaging winds and heavy rainfall, which could lead to flash flooding, at around 5pm for the areas of Gosford, Sydney, Wollongong, Nowra, Armidale and Orange.

"A series of moving portraits show both sides of living with disabilities in India. British photographer Graeme Robertson travelled to Rajasthan with Sightsavers, a charity that helps visually impaired people to carry on with their lives as independently as possible. He photographed several blind or partially-sighted people living in the Indian state for the Put Us in the Picture campaign - Sightsavers' policy campaign to influence the UK Government's foreign aid policy. The campaign wants to make people aware that although people with disabilities have the same needs and rights to health, education and employment as others, they are one of the most excluded groups in society, particularly in the poorest countries of the world. A series of moving portraits show difficulty that people like Sankarlal (left) and Dallu (right) have with living with disabilities in India. The photos are part of Sightsavers charity's Put Us in the Picture campaign. It wants disabled people included in all UK international aid programmes . They want the Department For International Development to make sure people with disabilities participate in, and benefit from, all international development programmes. Some of the people that Graeme photographed have benefitted from one of the Sightsaver's inclusion projects. The projects help people to rebuild their lives in many ways, including giving advice on how to apply for loans and disability support from the government, training for work that doesn't require full sight and also general building of confidence. But the campaign also covered the plight of those who have so far received no help and the heartbreaking isolation that this can cause, with people wholly dependent on the charity of families. Read on to hear the stories of some of those who took part in the project. Shyam: . Shyam, 36, has been visually impaired for the past 15 years. He said: 'I wasn't born blind, but became blind later. The doctor said I have glaucoma and the cornea can't be repaired. I can see black, white, yellow. I can make out colours from a distance. I can see the moon but not the stars.' He says he is treated with pity and contempt by other people, with many laughing if they see him stumble in the street. He adds that sometimes, 'people spread thorns on the street so it hurts more.' Shyam, 36, has been visually impaired for the past 15 years. He is treated with pity and contempt by other people, with many laughing if they see him stumble in the street. He adds that sometimes, 'people spread thorns on the street so it hurts more.' He continues: 'In all families, even my own, people think you're useless. In society, if you have no money and no work you're considered a burden and people won't talk to you.' Shyam has dreams to start a business, get a small house and have a wife and family of his own but his poor eyesight is preventing that from happening. He said: 'In this village there is no opportunity. If I had money I would go to the city. I can do any job. I cook for myself and clean the house so why can't I work? 'I would like to have kids but the community doesn't believe in marriage if you're not working and earning.' Sankarlal: . Sankarlal's sight began to deteriorate in his early teens, as a result of cataracts in both eyes and by the time he was 14 he was completely blind, and treatment to fix the problem was unsuccessful. He married his now-wife Gomati and had three children, but was frustrated few job opportunities were available to him. He said: 'I used to sit inside the house and my wife used to go to work and support me.' Sankarlal's life changed when he joined a group funded by Sightsavers for people with disabilities . Their purpose is empowerment – informing people of their rights and supporting them to gain skills and employment. Sankarlal's sight began to deteriorate in his early teens, as a result of cataracts in both eyes and by the time he was 14 he was completely blind, and treatment to fix the problem was unsuccessful. An organisation funded by Sightsavers helped him to apply for a loan to start his own business . The organisation helped him to apply for a loan to start his own business, which started off as a mobile shop on a bicycle. It then expanded to a building next to his house that sells larger products like vegetables and pulses and has a refrigerator for cold drinks. He said: 'Now I earn myself. Before people thought I was unproductive, they pitied me, but now I stand on my own legs. 'My family think I am one of them and can do what they do.' Sankarlal: . Sankarlal, a 60-year-old man from the Rajasthan district of Bikaner lost his sight in 1984 after someone threw acid into his face. He said: 'I have lived two lives. But it's okay, it happens. Many people are blind from birth. I could, at least, see for 30 years.' Following the attack, his disability and appearance meant he was ashamed to leave the house. Sankarlal, a 60-year-old man from the Rajasthan district of Bikaner lost his sight in 1984 after someone threw acid into his face. Times were tough until they received support from a government self-employment scheme for people with disabilities, which allowed him and his family to open a shop in their home . He used to tend buffalo, whose milk he would sell to a cooperative dairy, but had to give this up, so his son, Hansraj, supported the family by running a rented shop. Times were tough until they received support from a government self-employment scheme for people with disabilities, which allowed them to open a shop in their home. Nowadays, the whole family – Sankarlal, his wife Chawlidevi, Hansraj and his wife, and their two children aged 10 and 12 – help to run the store. Anuradha: . Anuradha, who's now 32, was only one year old when she fell into a fire, badly burning her hands and face. For a few years she was unaware of having any disability, but when she started school she noticed people would stare at her and it affected her confidence. 'I felt ugly,' she says. 'When people asked what happened I didn't know what to say.' A few decades passed and Anuradha was still suffering from a lack of confidence. Anuradha, who's now 32, was only one year old when she fell into a fire, badly burning her hands and face. She saw an advert for a disabled people's organisation by chance and is now her division's leader . She'd left her husband, and was trying to support her two children (son Raj, 10, and five-year-old daughter Mohita) by working as a teacher, but was barely getting by. She saw an advert by chance in a newspaper about a meeting of the local DPO (disabled people's organisation) and was curious to find out more. When she attended, she met 'brothers and sisters, people like me,' and realised that, like them, she could do things for herself and others. 'I got to know I could get a pension and travel pass.' From these small steps Anuradha's confidence grew and she now has a job as leader of the DPO. Dallu: . Dallu, who's 28, lost her sight after contracting smallpox at the age of seven. She lives with her father and other family members – because they worry about her getting hurt, she rarely goes out. She said: 'Because of my blindness, when I move around even inside the house sometimes I fall or hit the wall.' She now only goes out a couple of times a year.

Although she's married, Dallu doesn't see her husband. Her mother used to look after her, but died two years ago.  She'd love to be able to do things for herself, like filling a bucket of water to take a shower, but says her family have to do it for her. She said: 'I can't do anything and I don't want to do anything. If you put the cot there and tell me to sit there I will do it.

"Two U.S. Army recruiters are facing charges of unlawful sex with a minor after, police say, the two had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old they met while recruiting at a Florida high school. Christopher Glenn Doner, 30, and John Back, 33, reportedly met the girl earlier this year while recruiting at Harmony High School, the Orlando Sentinel reports. The two had both been in sexual relationships with the girl for several months, at the same time, and both asked her to stop seeing the other one but she did not, Twis Lizasuain, sheriff's spokeswoman, told the newspaper.

Abbott was the unfortunate player who delivered the bouncer that struck Hughes in the neck during the Sheffield Shield clash at the Sydney Cricket Ground last Tuesday. The 22-year-old has received overwhelming support from the entire cricket community including Hughes' own family who told Daily Mail Australia the day before the funeral on Tuesday that they were looking forward to seeing Abbott and embracing him with open arms. A family member expressed the empathy they felt Abbott's unbearable situation . 'We can't wait to see Sean Abbott tomorrow and give him a big kiss and hug,' the family member told Daily Mail Australia at the time.

"An Iranian photographer has captured the desperate lives of South Asian labourers who travel to Dubai in the hope of building a future for their families - but find only squalor, low wages and backbreaking work in stifling heat. Farhad Berahman's pictures were taken in Sonapur, the unofficial name for a work camp on the outskirts of Dubai, located far away from the luxury, soaring skyscrapers and vast wealth that the United Arab Emirates city is renowned for. 'Sonapur' - ironically, the name means 'City of Gold' in Hindi - is home to more than 150,000 workers, mostly from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and China. Scroll down for video . An Iranian photographer has captured the harsh lives endured by the migrant workers building Dubai's ever-growing skyline.

Misery: Farhad explains that several workers have their passports seized at the airport, and are forced to work extremely long hours in blistering heat for very little pay. Sonapur is now home for more than 150,000 workers, mostly from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and China . Grim living standards: Jahangir, 27, from Bangladesh, has worked as a cleaner for the past four years. He earns 800 AED (£139) a month and sends 500 AED (£87) to his family. He uses the rest of the money for rent and food . Soaring: Thirty years ago, almost all of Dubai was a desert but it has become one of the main trade hubs and tourist destinations in the region . Thirty years ago, almost all of Dubai was a desert but it has grown rapidly become one of the main commercial hubs and tourist destinations in the region. The photographer has visited Dubai many times and has watched it grow in  size and wealth. The 33-year-old says there is an unspoken understanding that there are three different classes of people in Dubai - the Emiratis, the expats and, at the bottom, the labourers who built the city. Farhad explains that several workers have their passports seized at the airport and are forced to work extremely long hours in blistering heat for very little pay. They are taken to Sonapur - which is not on the map - so they can be better controlled by employers. He spoke to one labourer called Jahangir from Bangladesh. The 27-year-old has worked as a cleaner for the past four years and earns 800 AED (£139) a month and sends 500 AED (£87) to his family. He is forced to survive on what little remains.

Every evening, the hundreds of thousands of young men who build the city are driven to vast concrete wastelands to work . These labourers are working on luxurious boats in a shipyard in Jaddaf. These boats are used mostly for tourism and can fetch $3,755,000 . Farhad explains: 'People come to this land to make their future and benefit from the huge investments in construction and oil. 'There are many luxurious hotels and world-renowned structures which labourers have built over recent years. 'The employer usually takes their passport as soon as they arrive at Dubai airport and they are all sent to Sonapur. 'The labourers usually work 14 hours where in summer the temperature goes over 50C. 'Conversely, it is usually advised for western tourists not to stay outside for more than five minutes in summer. 'According to the government's laws, work places should close down during this kind of temperature in order not to harm labourers and their health, but the government often does not even announce the right weather temperature.' Harrowing: Their accommodation is cramped, filthy, sweltering and often overrun with vermin. Yet many can't leave . The secret vegetable market within Sonapur is a cheap place for labourers to provide themselves with vegetable and fruits . When Farhad arrived he saw dozens of men sitting around the courtyard on broken furniture, cooking in dirty kitchens and stray animals skulking around. He added: 'The rooms are 12ft by 12ft with six beds and accommodate six to eight people. Food is usually cooked using gas cylinders in terrible condition. 'One of the Chinese workers stopped me, took me to his room and showed me a sign he had written on some wood. It read: 'Dear Boss I am working in your company already 1 year, my contract was expired but I cannot get my salary all 4 month less. I must go China soon, please pay for my money.'

Shahroukh, who enjoys a better standard of living than other workers, gets ready before heading out to work at a decoration company . The expats who enjoy high incomes will likely never experience the dark side of Dubai, where the labourers' suffering is hidden from the media. Farhad says he was so moved after seeing it for himself that he decided to create the photo series. He said: 'I did not try to get permission since these areas are restricted to the public and I was sure I would be unsuccessful since the  UAE does not wish to show this aspect of their country. 'So, I took pictures at night when it was much easier to hide from security. As soon as I started  meeting labourers and getting to know them, I realised they were scared of me. 'After a while one of the labourers who could speak English told Farhad they were afraid he was from the government. Devotion: Labourers heading back to their rooms after evening prayer. The mosque inside Sonapur is one of the few well-maintained buildings . Ali Sadam, 24,  has been working as cleaner for the past two years and lives with five roommates in Sonapur . He added: 'Most of the time I slept in my car and waited until it got dark so I could do my work.' In spite of his efforts, the photographer was arrested by security and questioned. 'I pretended to be a lost tourist and the security wanted to report me to the police since the labourers' area is forbidden to photograph.' They let him go. The Iranian photographer hopes that this series will make people think twice about what goes on around them, and if they are moved by the suffering they might be encouraged to do something to help. 'I think treating humans so cruelly is against their human rights and yet it still exists around us,' he said. 'I can't tell anyone what to think of the images, but I believe they speak for themselves.'","Photographer Farhad Berahman's striking photos document the  lives of South Asian labourers who travel to Dubai .

"A British businessman who escaped jail by fleeing Dubai after having an affair with a married mother has returned to the country to try and get the conviction quashed, MailOnline can reveal. Brian Clark was convicted in Dubai Misdemeanours Court in 2009 of having illicit sex with Marnie Pearce. Ms Pearce, a 46-year-old British mother-of-two, was convicted of adultery in the strictly Islamic United Arab Emirates when her husband Ihab El Labban accused her of cheating on him. She was jailed for three months and lost custody of her two sons in a notorious case that made headlines around the world. Scroll down for video . Jailed: Marnie Pearce made headlines around the world when she was jailed for adultery after allegedly having an affair with Brian Clark in Dubai. She then lost custody of her two sons . Counter claim: Ms Pearce claims that her husband, Ihab El Labban, above, made up the adultery claim to win custody. She then went on to allege that it was HE who was having the affair . In an ironic twist, Ms Marnie's husband then moved in with the American woman she said HE was having an affair with - but escaped scot-free. And in the latest development in the six-year saga, oil-worker Mr Clark is trying to get the case quashed because more than five years have passed since the original conviction. His lawyer Yousuf Hammad told Dubai Misdemeanours Court: 'My client is a married man and a father and lives a happy and stable life. His family depends on him. 'He was sentenced in absentia more than five years ago. We ask the court to dismiss the case due to time lapse.' Ms Pearce was embroiled in a lengthy, bitter and eventually futile battle with her husband to keep her children. The pair married in a dream wedding in the Seychelles in 1999 but not long after their sons Laith, now 13, and Zaid, 10, were born, the marriage fell apart. According to Ms Pearce, a former florist and teaching assistant, they split acrimoniously after she discovered he had been having an affair with American former actress Tonya Thompson, 52. The U.S. businesswoman met Mr El Labban, 47, while visiting Dubai in 2007. His wife said she threw him out after discovering a love letter from Miss Thompson. But her nightmare began in March 2008 when Mr El Labban told police it was she who was having an affair. Anguish: Ms Pearce was caught on video handing over the boys after going on the run for a month with them . Adultery is a criminal offence in the UAE and Ms Pearce contends her estranged husband hurled accusations in a bid to win sole custody of their children. Police who raided her family home found her having tea with Mr Clark, the brother of Ms Pearce's friend, who was visiting Dubai. Despite her claims the friendship was innocent and she had only met Mr Clark three times, officers seized five used condoms and emails. The condoms bearing her DNA (although Mr Clark was never tested) were enough to seal her conviction in November 2008, although she maintained they were planted by Mr El Labban, a former executive with pharmaceuticals firm Procter & Gamble. She appealed and had the sentence reduced to three months in February 2009. Crucially though, she lost custody of her sons. She went on the run for a month to enjoy a few last precious moments with her children, but then handed over the sobbing boys in heartrending scenes outside Dubai criminal courts and gave herself in. 'I was searched and most of my personal items were confiscated,' she said on her release. 'I had to beg the woman guard to let me keep five photos of the children. 'I was strip-searched. I felt so humiliated.' During her time in prison, she shared cells with murderers and prostitutes and lost nearly a stone. The thought of seeing her boys again kept her going. 'Speaking to them on the phone kept me sane,' she said at the time. 'Yet at one point, Ihab wouldn't let me. It was torture.' She insisted: 'I have done nothing wrong. I am a good mother and while my ex-husband would not hurt a hair on the children's heads, what he is doing is wrong. Love quadrangle: Mr El Labban married Tonya Thompson in 2010 and has set up home with her in Florida . 'I never had an affair. This all feels unreal. I knew I would be going to prison and just wanted four weeks with my babies so I could spend as much time with them as possible and so they would know I never intended to leave them.' Mr El Labban, meanwhile, contended: 'I am the victim in this. Marnie has done horrible things.' She was eventually released and her compulsory deportation order waived so she could stay in Dubai and have access to the children. Mr El Labban, in the meantime, married Miss Thompson in 2010 and moved in with her in Orlando - but not before bringing a civil lawsuit claiming emotional and psychological damage and being awarded £3,500 compensation from Ms Pearce. In the latest twist, Mr Clark is pushing to get the case thrown out. Mr Hammad told the court: 'The defence will not discuss the details of the crime considering it is more than five years old. 'We are seeking to have the legal action halted against the defendant and have the case dropped. My client's family is waiting for him.' Just why he is seeking to face justice after all this time is unclear.","Brian Clark was convicted five years ago in UAE of having illicit sex .

But he insisted that the fault posed no danger and the plant would return to running as normal on Friday. 'There is no threat ... there are no problems with the . reactors,' he said, adding that the accident affected the power output system and 'in no way' was linked to . power production itself. In Vienna, the International Atomic Energy Agency said it . had no immediate comment on the report. Under an international . convention, adopted after the 1986 Chernobyl accident in what . was then Soviet Ukraine, a country should notify the IAEA of any . nuclear accident that can impact other countries. The explosion and fire at the Chernobyl power plant, the world's worst nuclear accident, was caused by human error and a series of blasts sent a cloud of radioactive dust billowing across northern and western Europe. Volodymyr Demchyshyn, Ukraine's energy minister, briefed the media on the accident during a news conference, insisting everything at the plant will be back to normal on Friday . Ukraine, Belarus and Russia, have estimated the death toll at only a few thousand as a result of the explosion while the environmental group Greenpeace says the accident will eventually cause up to 93,000 extra cancer deaths worldwide. Interfax news agency said a 1,000-megawatt reactor was housed in the bloc at Zaporizhzhya where last Friday's accident occurred. Mr Demchyshyn said the affected bloc had been provisionally disconnected from the electro-energy system though its reactor continued to work normally. 'Its power output is not being used. I think that the problem will be resolved by Friday,' he said. The accident has had an impact on Ukraine's energy system, but Mr Demchyshyn said he would ask the major industrial consumers to impose a 'voluntary restriction' in energy consumption. Ukraine produced more than 60 million tonnes of coal last year, making it self-sufficient in electricity and coal. Separatist fighting in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions since June has halted production at 66 coal mines, however, leaving Ukrainian power plants without enough raw materials.","Plant operator announced short circuit in power-generating unit at the site .

"Fernando Alonso's relationship with Lewis Hamilton appears to be back to full strength after behind-the-scenes footage emerged of the pair embracing following the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi. Alonso left McLaren under a cloud at the end of the 2007 campaign after falling out with the British team and  Hamilton as they battled for the title in the Briton's debut year. But Alonso, who will re-join McLaren next season after ending his five-year relationship with Ferrari, congratulated Hamilton, his father Anthony and girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger in the Mercedes motorhome following the Briton's world championship triumph in the desert.

Hamilton won the final race of the season to beat Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg to the Formula One crown and join Alonso as a double world champion. Alonso and Hamilton are seen entering into a conversation during the brief video before his popstar girlfriend Nicole pays tribute to Alonso's beard. The McLaren hierarchy will meet on Thursday to discuss the identity of Alonso's team-mate next season with Danish driver Kevin Magnussen likely to be retained in favour of Jenson Button. Hamilton crosses the start-finish line to win the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix and seal his second Formula One title . And Hamilton believes Alonso will be better prepared to work under McLaren boss Ron Dennis after his acrimonious exit from the team seven years ago. 'It is an interesting decision with the team, but I wish him all the best,' said Hamilton. 'Fernando has grown a huge amount over the years, both as a driver and maturity wise as well. 'And, having the experience previously with Ron, he will definitely have a much better handle on it and won't be in a tricky situation like last time.'","Alonso paid Brit Hamilton a surprise visit in the Mercedes motorhome .

"Just days after the FBI urged members of the military to clear their social media accounts of anything that might draw attention to them for fear of an ISIS attack in the homeland, one very important members of the armed forces has gone out and ignored their request. Medal of Honor winner Dakota Meyer, who served in the Marines for four years, has used both his Twitter and Facebook to taunt members of ISIS, calling them 'cowards.' And now, many around the country are applauding his actions. Scroll down for video . Standing strong: Medal of Honor winner Dakota Meyer has ignored the FBI's request to not taunt ISIS on social media . Proud soldier: Meyer served for four years in the Marines . Won't back down: On Twitter, Meyer invited ISIS members to his book club . 'When I start having to change my life because I'm worried about something that could happen to me, that means terrorism is winning,"" he told ABC News. 'That means terrorism is working.' He then added, 'I refuse to let these idealistic, radical bullies change the way that I live.' FBI officials had released this warning on Monday in fear there may be a copycat attack in the United States similar to the one that happened this past October in Canada, when two soldiers were killed in two separate incidents by young men who claimed they were ISIS followers in the span of just one week. Meyer does not seem to be concerned though, posting his first amusing threat to Twitter on Tuesday, which showed him smoking a pipe and reading a Marine handbook. 'Wonder if any ISIS members want to drop by and join my book club,' wrote Meyer. He also wrote on Tuesday, in a post on the website Scout, 'If ISIS is using social media to track me, that's a dream come true in my book. These guys are a bunch of bullies that just prey on the weak.' 'I can't travel over there anymore now that I'm out of the Marine Corps, so having them come to me would help out a lot. ISIS targeting the U.S. military is like a sheep targeting a lion. Hopefully one of these a**holes actually shows up. They'll definitely get more than they want at my place!' He then closed by saying, 'I'll take the responsibility to be the liaison for the military. I live in Columbia, Kentucky—oops, is that too much information? Oh well.' They won't win: Meyer also said if he backs down that would mean 'terrorism is winning' American hero: Meyer received his medal for repeatedly entering a kill zone in Afghanistan and saving 36 troops . Meyer was awarded the Medal of Honor in 2011 after repeatedly charging into a kill zone during a 2009 ambush in Kunar Province, Afghanistan in search of four of his missing soldiers. He was able to rescue 36 troops and kill eight Taliban attackers despite being shot in the arms. He was not however able to save his four fellow soldiers and friends who he went in search of, though he did make sure to go back and carry each of their bodies to safety. 'Because of your humble example, our kids — especially back in Columbia, Kentucky, in small towns all across America — they’ll know that no matter who you are or where you come from, you can do great things as a citizen and as a member of the American family,' said President Obama at his ceremony.","Dakota Meyer, a Medal of Honor winner, has taken to social media to write amusing taunts to members of ISIS .

"A pair of Burmese migrant workers have been charged in connection with the brutal murder of two British tourists at a luxury Thai beach resort. David Miller, 24, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, were found mutilated on Sairee beach on the after attending a party on the island of Koh Tao in September. Autopsies showed both had suffered severe head wounds and Witheridge had been raped, before their bodies were discovered near the resort known for world-class scuba diving. Scroll down for video . Hannah Witheridge and David Miller were brutally murdered on the island of Koh Tao in Thailand this summer . Burmese migrant workers Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, both 21,  have been charged with the murders. They claim they were tortured by Thai police before they confessed to the crime. The pair were working in the country illegally . Burmese bar workers Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, who were working in the country illegally, have now been charged by Thai prosecutors with with conspiracy to murder, conspiracy to rape and robbery, according to deputy police chief spokesman Colonel Kissana Phathanacharoen. Neither man appeared at the Provincial Court on the island of Ko Samui and they will have an opportunity to enter a plea at the next hearing, he added. They are also entitled to request bail at any time, he said. Police claimed the men confessed to the killings in October, adding that the DNA evidence matched that of the two suspects. Prosecutors have said other evidence includes close-circuit television footage linking the two to the crime. But there has been international concern about the way the case has been handled by the Thai authorities. The pair, both 21, have admitted they were drinking beer and playing guitar near the scene where Witheridge from Great Yarmouth and Miller from Jersey were found on September. They could be sentenced to die by lethal injection if they are convicted. The backpackers' bodies were found in the surf on Sairee Beach (pictured) in the early hours of the morning . But they claim that their initial confessions were extracted by beatings and threats and it was reported that a Burmese embassy official later formally retracted their statements to police. Amnesty International has called for an investigation into the allegations, citing a lawyer from the Burmese embassy legal team who said he had been told that police had beaten one suspect and 'threatened him with electrocution.' The Foreign Office has also expressed concern to Thai authorities about whether the investigation was conducted properly and British detectives also flew to the country to observe and assist the Thai investigators with the case, last month. Along with the torture allegations, police have also been criticised for failing to secure the crime scene and releasing several names and pictures of suspects who turned out to be innocent. They were also condemned after they paraded Lin and Htun in front of cameras shortly after the had made their confessions. A lawyer for the pair also said key witnesses are too afraid to come forward, hampering his clients' defence as they prepare to enter a plea. 'This case is not fair,' Nakhon Chomphuchat, head of their Thai legal team told the AFP. 'They were migrant workers so witnesses do not dare to testify (for the defence). 'We have many disadvantages ... we still have not seen the prosecutors' evidence, we just have to fight as best as we can,' he added. Royal Thai Police Major General Suwat Jaengyodsuk defended the investigation before the country's Human Rights Commission yesterday, according the Bangkok Post. Insisting the DNA tests and arrests had been handled by the book he said there had been no torture at any time during the investigation, the paper reported. Witheridge, a student at the University of Essex, was described by her family as 'a beautiful, intelligent, loving young woman who poured joy into the lives of all who knew her'. Mr Miller finished studying civil and structural engineering at Leeds University in June, where he was on course to achieve a first-class degree. His family said he was a 'hard-working, bright and conscientious' young man who would be 'sorely, sorely missed.'

"Manchester City's players have plenty of reasons to smile after their 4-1 win against Sunderland on Wednesday night but they were in far more sombre mood ahead of kick-off at the Stadium of Light. In another of their popular Christmas videos, the club's media department challenged six of Manuel Pellegrini's first-team to avoid laughing during funny YouTube clips . David Silva, Pablo Zabaleta, Eliaquim Mangala, Aleksandar Kolarov, Martin Demichelis and Edin Dzeko agreed to take part, with mixed results to say the least. Manchester City defender Pablo Zabaleta was one of six players to take part in the YouTube challenge . Striker Edin Dzeko struggles to compose himself before being shown four funny videos . Summer signing Eliaquim Mangala also showed his sense of humour by taking part in the festive video . City's stars took turns to sit in front of a laptop and watch a quartet of hilarious clips posted on the internet's most popular video-sharing site. Dzeko didn't get off to a good start, finding it difficult to compose himself before the play button had even been clicked. And the Bosnian striker didn't last much longer, eventually letting out a giggle towards the end of the first baby-themed clip as Zabaleta also bowed out early on in the competition. The second video, a clip showing a baby chuckling at sheets of paper being torn, failed to claim any victims but the straight faces didn't last long. Argentine defender Zabaleta can't stop himself from laughing at a clip of a baby pulling a stern face . Martin Demichelis eventually cracked up when shown a video of a man hurling himself into a wall . Another hilarious baby clip meant Spanish midfielder David Silva bowed out at the final video . Demichelis couldn't stop himself laughing at a man inexplicably launching himself into a wall, while Silva and Mangala cracked when shown a baby attempting a Kung Fu impression. That left Kolarov, famed for his hard exterior after his not-so-festive rendition of Jingle Bills two years ago, as the winner. After being informed that he'd completed the challenge and that the clips were the best City's media team could find, the defender responded: 'This one? Not for me. Where is my present?' That could well be the easiest victory a City player has this season. Aleksandar Kolarov was left unimpressed with the videos and easily stopped himself from laughing .","Six Manchester City players took part in the Christmas challenge .

"Ever get the feeling someone’s trying to make a monkey out of you? By the dejected look on Bili the chimpanzee’s face he thinks Tesco are doing just that – after they stopped selling discount bananas to his sanctuary. Fortunately for the 33-year-old chimp, Jan Garen, who runs the Wales Ape and Monkey Sanctuary in Abercave, near Swansea, took a more proactive approach to the problem. Scroll down for video . The monkeys at Wales Ape and Monkey Sanctuary, in Abercrave, near Swansea, appeared unimpressed by Tesco's decision to cancel its supply of waste food to the centre. However, it has now changed its mind . Mrs Garen used to drive to Tesco to buy cut-price waste fruit, vegetables and other produce, until last September staff abruptly told her the special deal was over. She wrote to the store manager asking for an explanation. But when none came she posted the letter on Facebook. It said: ‘It was very disappointing to be told that Tesco will no longer support the sanctuary. I have telephoned and left a message for you but having heard nothing I am writing instead.’ As she waited weeks for an answer, thousands read her post – and many threatened to boycott Tesco. Tesco said it had changed its policy on supplying waste food and didn't want the monkeys to become ill . She was eventually told the supermarket had changed its rules because it didn’t want the monkeys to become ill from eating out-of-date food. She said: ‘There is no way we would feed the monkeys anything we thought might put their health at risk.’ Tesco has insisted that it can no longer provide eggs, yoghurts and other fresh foods. But it has relented on discounted fruit and veg – and a steady supply is back on the menu again. The fruit, veg and other fresh waste food is given to the 90 monkeys and apes who live at the sanctuary . The ape sanctuary spends about £5,000 a year on waste food from the supermarket for the monkeys . The ape sanctuary has bought waste food from Tesco at 10 per cent of the retail price for several years . However, the supermarket giant said it would continue to supply fruit and veg, but not eggs and yoghurts . .","Ape and Monkey Sanctuary regularly bought cheap waste food from Tesco .

"Yesterday we brought you what we thought were the most awkward Christmas photos of all time, but overnight, more snaps have surfaced of families grimacing in seasonal attire. As families start sending out their Christmas cards, many - like Tony and Cherie Blair earlier this week - will have opted for the personal touch, printing seasonal snaps featuring loved ones, children and pets. But as the former Prime Minister and his barrister wife's annual greeting proves, festive portraits have the potential to inspire more ha ha ha's than ho ho ho. These pictures show the cringe-inducing lengths some parents will go to produce the ultimate holiday greeting even if that means stripping off, cuddling bizarre pets, dressing in matching tartan or even donning PVC. One family even braved the winter chill to strip down and show off their brand new hot tub. Scroll down for video .

One father dresses up as his own baby (left) while another little one is decorated in a straitjacket of fairy lights (right) Resembling a snap from an office party, this family strip off for a naughty festive portrait . Bad Santas with a black eye, matching Christmas jumpers and dad naked by the dinner table, these photographs are definitely on the naughty list. There are a few turkeys in this festive photo album as the most wonderful time of the year is captured in all its awkward glory. Some went even further, dropping the swimming trunks and bikinis, favouring a fig leaf - instead of mistletoe - to cover their modesty in saucy family shot. One family attempted to pose as Santa and his reindeer but just ended up looking like a disjointed human centipede. While others demonstrated that pets such as budgies, a duck and birds of prey and are always risky props. Others covered up in the retro-styled Christmas jumpers that are all the rage at the moment but some of these festive frights are more suited to Halloween.

This toddler dressed as a gingerbread man is pulling her angriest face but still looks adorable . Although even the worst woollen wear can't match one family's own tie-dye fashion disaster. They at least took the trouble to co-ordinate their clobber. One dad decided to ruin his relative's festive memories by secretly getting his kit off just before he said cheese. The smile on children's faces at Christmas often makes the months of work that parents put in to finding the perfect present all worth it. But instead their kid's terrible tantrums and tears have been turned into cherished memories in these pics. One naughty boy was even wrapped up in Christmas lights as a punishment - Santa surely didn't visit him that year. Even old Mr Claus himself has been risking the sack with a few creepy pictures. Some people go all-out when it comes to dressing up, like this family of festive presents . A  greetings card from a loved-up couple (left) and a pair of siblings who seem to have the holiday mixed up (right) One little girl knows how to get her own way when it comes to sharing, as proven in this family shot . These children are wondering why on earth mum and dad brought them to see Father Christmas - clearly not fans . This family ditched the Christmas sweaters and opted for just a fig leaf to cover their modesty . St. Nicks were snapped letting beards slip, dozing after a few too many sherries and one bad Santa even boasted a black eye. This album of awkwardness certainly proves the saying you can 'pick your friends but you can't pick your family' is true. Nothing looks quite as uncomfortable as matching outfits, except, of course, when just one member of the family decides to just dispense with clothes altogether. But perhaps it's worth treasuring these photos, as next time you feel a little embarrassed about being in a family snap at Christmas, you will remember it could be a lot worse.

"Shot and killed: Tamir Rice, 12, who was holding an airsoft pistol in a park in Cleveland, Ohio . St Louis County Police is mired in fresh killer cop controversy after a post on the force's official facebook page appeared to blame a 12-year-old black boy for the police shooting that killed him. Tamir Rice was playing with a toy gun when he was shot dead by a white officer in Cleveland last week. The tragic incident further fueled the anger and protests that have raged in the wake first of a Grand Jury's failure to indict Ferguson officer Darren Wilson for the shooting of Michael Brown and, now, a second Grand Jury's failure to indict the NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo for his fatal chokehold arrest of Eric Garner. Today, the St Louis force has been slammed for the posting titled, 'Kids will be Kids?' which warned parents, 'Your children should have rules for a toy gun that mirror the rules for a real gun.' Scroll down for video . Weapon: Tamir Rice was captured on CCTV with an airsoft pistol which had no orange muzzle guard . 'Gun': The airsoft replica of a Colt handgun which was taken from Tamir Rice after he was shot . Official account: This was the message posted by Officer Dilks on St Louis County Police's official Twitter today . lengthy: The Facebook posting by the officer which has now been deleted. It said was not about 'whether it was a justified shooting' but was accused of 'victim blaming' The Facebook posting which was tweeted on the department's official feed continued, 'Warn them that these 'toys' do look like real guns and could result in getting the police called on them. The police may get called to respond to a 'child with a gun'…If the type of gun is in question by the witness the Police will respond as though it is a real gun.' The post read by many as victim-blaming went onto provide 'tips' for how a child should behave in such a situation. 'Do not run away. They need to no longer have the gun in their hands, throw it away from them. They need to comply with officers instructions. They may be ordered to lie down on the ground.' Within minutes of tweeting this posting at 7.59am the St Louis County Police City of Fenton Precinct department whose officer wrote the post was facing demands to have their twitter account closed down. Critics dammed the post as 'heartless' and 'victim blaming' and described the officers as 'psychopaths.' Later in the day Chief Jon Belmar used the same page to apologize for the post. 'The post conveyed the message that my officers respond to calls involving a child with a gun with indiscretion and little regard for life,' he admitted. 'The intention of the post was to inform citizens about the potential danger of airsoft or pellet guns resembling real guns. 'However, the post was a misguided communication strategy and was offensive to many people. 'As Chief of Police, I apologize to Tamir’s family and anyone who was offended by the post. 'While the post did not originate from the Chief’s Office and I was unaware of its presence prior to its release, I realize the message was insensitive to Tamir’s family and the sorrow they are currently experiencing.' But the Fenton officer who wrote the post has defended his actions. Neighborhood cop Aaron Dilks said 'I too was a kid, and I would have done the same thing as Tamir Rice did.

'I was allowed to go play with guns and have BB guns - we didn't have Airsofts at the time. The point of 'kids will be kids' is that's what kids will do… . 'The point of putting [the post] out was to educate and make sure something like this doesn't happen in the city of Fenton or in our area.' As for Rice, Dilks added, 'It's a tragedy. It's a shame that a child got shot. I guess that's all I should probably say about it.' The post has now been removed from the facebook page and the link deleted from the force's official twitter feed.

"Now this is a man who loves his job! A plumber from Dundee has become an overnight sensation thanks to a hilarious video - filmed by his co-worker - which catches him in the middle of an epic dance sequence. Mark Topen was caught showing off his moves to a Robert Miles song - when he should have been working. The 52-year-old plumber spoke to the Evening Telegraph after the video hit the Internet on Thursday, saying: 'I'll admit that it was a bit embarrassing at first, but I suppose that is what is funny about it and I can see that now. 'It's not something I would do all the time because it can be disrespectful to do it in people's homes but this house was empty.

'Sometimes the job can be stressful, so it’s good to take the pressure off if you can.' In the amusing footage, Mark, known to his friends as Toby, really gives it his all - even performing an impressive spin at one point. Still, becoming something of a local celebrity has all been a bit 'unbelievable.' He said: 'It’s been amazing and I have received so many calls and texts from people telling me they have seen it online. Mark Topen was understandably embarrassed upon learning he'd been discovered, but soon laughed it off . 'In one day I had over 100 people text me to say they’ve seen the video and couldn’t help but laugh.

"Former England footballer Michael Owen has been inundated with critical messages after starring in a 'sexist' new car ad. In the ad, which was made on behalf of his local car dealership, Owen, who is married to childhood sweetheart Louise Bonsall, compares women to luxury cars and goes on to boast about the 'dozens' of Jaguars he owns. 'You've got to go for looks to start with,' said the star in the clip, before adding: 'Then you look inside. It's probably similar to girls isn't it? Awkward! In the new advert former footballer Michael Owen compares women to luxury cars . 'The look attracts you to start with and then you get to know them a bit more, I think it's the same with cars.' Andrew North, a director at Alexanders Prestige, the dealership behind the ad, defended Owen's statement when contacted by MailOnline. 'I think it's a fair comparison,' said Mr North. 'You are attracted to the outside but ultimately, it's what's on the inside that counts and that's what he was trying to say. 'We actually filmed three hours of footage so that was just a very small part of it.' The cringe-making video, which is set to a classical soundtrack, begins with Owen, 34, standing in the middle of the garage surveying the cars around him.

'I had a deal with Jaguar for a long time as well, so probably had a dozen Jaguars and a few others.' He continued: 'You know, you grow with cars I was never going to get a Ferrari at 18 or something. You wait until you've earned your stripes so to speak.' Owen - who was once reported to have a net worth of £40million - was clearly unaware that for most, the stumbling block to Jaguar ownership is not being too young but being unable to afford the £170,000 price tag. Not content with that, Owen added: 'In football there is a hierarchy so if you go in with a nicer car than someone who has played a 100 games and played for his country then you'll be quickly slapped down and told to sell it. Alan Patridge? Many have compared former England star Michael's punditry to the fictional character Alan Partridge . Star striker: Michael Owen celebrates a goal during the the 2002 World Cup . 'You have to grow your car organically as I say with how you're doing on the football pitch.' Defending his star, Mr North added: 'Michael was a pleasure to work with. We have known him for years and he have previously worked with him and his family through the equestrian side of the business. 'He was very happy to take part in the advert and we will be working with him again.' 'I met the chaps Andy and Alex [of Alexanders Prestige],' added Owen, 'and we've done a bit of business in the horsey world as well and obviously they picked a really nice one for me. 'I've driven Range Rovers before but it's probably eight, 10 years ago so the new model is lovely and I can't wait to put some miles on it.' When he's not promoting car dealerships, Owen - who during his career enjoyed stints at Liverpool, Real Madrid and Manchester United - works as a footballing pundit but has seen his efforts compared to Alan Partridge.

"No sooner has the pressure eased on one captain than it is being felt by another. The news that Alastair Cook will miss Sunday’s fourth one-day international in Colombo because of over-rate indiscretions has paved the way for Eoin Morgan to take the reins. Since Morgan is without a half-century in 15 one-day innings, the timing may not be ideal. But coach Peter Moores is hoping his temporary promotion will act as a ‘catalyst’ for a player who will need to be at his impish best if England are to have any chance of challenging for the World Cup next year. Eoin Morgan is on a wretched run of form but will captain England in Colombo on Sunday . Morgan’s latest failure, out for a single as he hooked a short ball from Angelo Mathews straight to deep backward square leg during England’s restorative five-wicket win over Sri Lanka in Hambantota on Wednesday night, felt like the act of a player wondering where his next score is coming from. Morgan trudges off after being dismissed for one in the third ODI against Sri Lanka . But England regard him as crucial to their gameplan of scoring heavily in the last 20 overs of an innings. And no player in the current squad has made more than his six centuries in the format. ‘He’ll be very disappointed that he hasn’t yet managed to impact on the series,’ said Moores. ‘He’s a top-flight one-day player. Maybe the captaincy will be a nice catalyst for him, and allow him to take his mind off himself and just go out and play.’ The travails of Cook, who was suspended for one game after twice failing in the last 12 months to keep his bowlers up with the required rate – against India at Cardiff in August and now in Hambantota – have masked Morgan’s own struggles. And Morgan’s have been the more surprising. A naturally gifted striker of the ball, with an eye for the improbable, he has looked recently like a magician shorn of his wand. Moores said: ‘The frustration for him will be how he’s got out a couple of times. You don’t go away from your basics. You do the things you know have worked in the past. You’ve got to believe in yourself. Maybe the captaincy can be a healthy distraction.’ There is frustration, too, that Cook has been forced out of a game having just presided over a victory that has unexpectedly dragged England back into this seven-match series. And while’s Cook’s 34 from 42 balls had a familiar air about it – getting in, then getting out, with Moeen Ali apparently playing a different game at the other end – Moores insisted his under-fire captain had been ‘timing it beautifully’. Morgan will take the reins as Alastair Cook (left) is banned for slow over rates in Hambantota . Morgan and Cook in 2014 (ODI innings . Alastair Cook . Matches: 17 Runs: 470 High score: 56 . Average: 29.37 Strike rate: 71.97 . Hundreds: 0 Fifties: 1 . Eoin Morgan . Matches: 18 Runs: 489 High score: 106 . Average: 27.16 Strike rate: 81.63 . Hundreds: 1 Fifties: 2 . The trick now will be to ensure that the Hambantota result is not a one-off, and Sri Lanka are expected to be boosted on Sunday by the return of the vastly experienced Mahela Jayawardene, who missed Wednesday’s match because it was his young daughter’s birthday. But Moores spoke of laughter on the team bus after the game – rare enough on this tour to merit a mention – and of the opportunity created for others by Cook’s enforced absence. Alex Hales will open with Ali after being given a chance last night at No 3 at the expense of Ian Bell, and the vacant slot in the line-up could be taken by James Taylor, the Nottinghamshire batsman who was one of the stars of the new Royal London One-Day Cup last summer. The England coach confirmed that Cook would resume the captaincy for the fifth game of this series, which dealt with the mischievous suggestion that the tourists may stumble across a successful formula without him. But, as Moores said: ‘We’re still trying to identify our best team.’ The awkward truth is that it may not include the man earmarked to lead England at the World Cup.","Alastair Cook suspended for fourth ODI against Sri Lanka .

"A 43-year-old mother has died in a house fire in Mount Helen, near Ballarat. Police originally feared the woman and her son and daughter, both 21, had died in the blaze but they have been safely located, the Ballarat Courier reported. A neighbour said she heard a 'whooshing' noise like a firecracker and a loud explosion before the fire started at about 1.30am on Friday. Two women and a man feared dead in house fire at Mount Helen, Victoria . Next-door neighbour Margaret Bell witnessed the explosion and called 000. 'I got up to grab a drink of water and I went back to bed,' Ms Bell told Daily Mail Australia. 'Then I heard a noise, you know how when a firecracker goes off it makes that whooshing sort of a noise, then that stopped and I heard a big explosion.' Ms Bell got out of bed and looked out her window to see the house in flames so she called the fire service. She added that the family had moved to Mount Helen from Ballarat just over one week ago. 'I'd spoken to the lady and her son, she was telling me a bit about herself,' she said. A body has reportedly been found but not identified and a mother, 43, and her son and daughter, both 21, are still unaccounted for . 'They'd moved out here because it's nice and quiet out here. 'It's really sad to think they might have been in the house.' Detective senior sergeant Dave Hermit said two dogs were found dead at the property. The fire took 20 firefighters 90 minutes to bring under control, and the house was completely destroyed. Country Fire Authority operations officer Kade Dowie said investigators believed the family were in the process of moving into the home. 'Investigations are continuing but the story from the neighbours is that they'd only recently moved in, as in last weekend,' Mr Dowie told Daily Mail Australia. Mr Dowie said the scene was handed over to the police forensics and arson squad on Friday morning but crews struggled to access inside the property. 'The intensity of the fire caused the ceiling and roof to collapse, which is causing difficulty with extinguishing and accessing,' he said. The cause of the fire is not yet known.","Body of mother, aged 43, found after house fire at Mount Helen in Victoria .

"A white man who was the police chief in a small South Carolina town has finally been charged with murder in the 2011 shooting death of an unarmed black man after being denied a 'stand your ground' defense. Richard Combs worked in Eutawville when 54-year-old Bernard Bailey, a retired corrections officer, came to the Town Hall to complain about a ticket his daughter had received over a broken taillight in May 2011. Following an argument, Combs issued Bailey an obstruction of justice warrant, and Bailey stormed out of the building. Bailey got into his truck in the parking lot and began backing up as Combs opened the driver's door of the pick-up. Indicted: Former Eutawville police chief Richard Combs (left) shot 54-year-old Bernard Bailey twice in the chest and once in the shoulder after Bailey entered town hall with a ticket complaint . Richard Combs, the former police chief and sole officer in the small town of Eutawville, listens in court with his lawyer John O'Leary on Thursday December 4, 2014, in Orangeburg, South Carolina, as he is charged . Scene: Bailey walked into the parking lot of the Town Hall after Combs served him with an arrest warrant and the two briefly fought at Bailey's truck before Combs started firing in May 2011 . The chief told investigators he felt his safety was threatened and began firing his gun. Combs fatally shot Bailey twice in the chest and once in the shoulder. After a delayed investigation, a grand jury indicted Combs on Wednesday, the same day a New York grand jury refused to indict an officer in the chokehold death of an unarmed black man. It's more than a week after a grand jury refused to indict an officer in the death of unarmed Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Combs' lawyer maintain the officer feared for his life. Prosecutors say he was the aggressor. Investigation: Family and friends of Bernard Bailey say the investigation into his death dragged on too long . Crime scene: Combs' lawyer maintain the officer feared for his life. Prosecutors say he was the aggressor . The indictment against Combs says the former police chief 'unlawfully used deadly force ... shooting and killing Bernard Bailey, when deadly force was not necessary,' during the confrontation, according to The Times and Democrat. 'There was no need for Mr. Combs to act as he did on May 2, 2011, when Mr. Bailey refused service, as Mr. Combs expected would happen,' the order stated. 'Mr. Combs should have allowed Mr. Bailey to leave and enlisted the assistance of other officers or serve the warrant at court as originally planned.' Combs was placed on administrative leave after the shooting. He was eventually fired. If found guilty, Combs faces up to 10 years in prison. Beareaved: Dorris and Briana Bailey, the wife and daughter of the victim, were awarded $400,000 in a wrongful death lawsuit earlier this year . Eutawville's population is just over 300 people. About one-third of the population are black. Friends and family of Bailey - a Walmart manager - have complained that the investigation into his death dragged on too long. In October 2012, the family filed their own lawsuit naming Combs, the town, and the police department in a wrongful death case, according to ABC News 4. Earlier this year they received $400,000 from the town as part of the settlement.","Former Eutawville Police Chief Richard Combs indicted over the shooting death of Bernard Bailey, 54, in May 2011 .

"Jenson Button is feeling 'really comfortable' over his future no matter which way the dice may fall at McLaren. A decision from the team as to whether Button or Kevin Magnussen will partner the returning Fernando Alonso next year is likely to be announced on Friday. It follows a board meeting on Thursday involving Group CEO Ron Dennis and two other primary shareholders in TAG co-owner Mansour Ojjeh and Mahmood Hashim Al Kooheji, CEO of Mumtalakat, Bahrain's sovereign wealth fund. VIDEO Scroll down for Mark Blundell: I would choose to have Alonso and Button . McLaren drivers Jenson Button (left) and Kevin Magnussen address the crowds at Edinburgh on Thursday . Button and Magnussen are vying to partner former Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso at McLaren in 2015 . Dennis has kept everyone waiting on tenterhooks for an announcement as he has opted to evaluate every aspect of his two drivers and take on board opinions, even though the final decision is his alone. It is understood Magnussen will get the nod, with Button switching to sportscars and a crack at the World Endurance Championship where good friends and two other former Formula One drivers in Mark Webber and Anthony Davidson currently ply their trade. Davidson even became a world champion in his own right last month when he and Toyota team-mate Sebastien Buemi, another ex-F1 driver, claimed the WEC crown. Such a move would represent a good step for Button, even though he would love an additional year at McLaren working alongside Alonso. The 34-year-old Englishman appeared in good spirits as he entertained the crowds in Scotland on Thursday . Fernando Alonso pays tribute to his Ferrari team in Abu Dhabi after ending his stay with the Italian outfit . 'It's a weird time,' said Button speaking at a Johnnie Walker 'responsible drinking' event in Edinburgh. 'It's the end of the season, we haven't got a race for many months, and I have had time to reflect on many things. 'The great thing is I've had my family and my mates round, so there have been a lot of people to talk to about it, to discuss. 'It's been an important week, but a really good week. I'm now really comfortable, and whatever happens I will have a great year next year. 'New challenges are exciting, whether it's in Formula One with McLaren alongside an exciting team-mate, or whether it's elsewhere. 'So I'm good, but I just want to get it done. I want to hear the decision - as we all do - so we can all move on in whatever direction.' Button speaks to the assembled media about his future . Button can understand McLaren pursuing a big name such as Alonso in light of Honda's arrival as power-unit supplier after a seven-year absence from F1, and their desire for a marquee name. But he feels it a pity McLaren could not keep faith with himself and Magnussen given the rapport he has developed with the young Dane. Button added: 'I've spent some time with Kevin over the past couple of days, and it's been really nice doing that. 'This situation has been difficult for both of us, but we've shown over the last couple of days that we work so well together. 'It's such a shame we won't be working together in the future in terms of being team-mates. 'But we're both very grown up about the situation and we'll both deal with it whichever way it goes.' Button does have irons in the fire, and whilst nothing is signed as he awaits Dennis' decision, he is looking forward to the future. 'There are options, but nothing set in stone yet,' added Button. 'What I can say is I'll definitely be racing next year, and in a series I'll be very excited to race in, so there's no worry of me not racing next year. 'If it's a new challenge it will be exciting, if it's in Formula One it will be very exciting as well because that will be a new challenge with Honda.'

"For the first time in recent memory, the sack race is a non-starter.

"Spain is steadily becoming a nation of 'ghost towns' - with empty apartment blocks, streets and weed-filled gardens where bustling communities were supposed to move. Entire housing estates built during the country's boom years have been left abandoned, bricked up and now on sale for almost half their original price. One such settlement is Sesena, dubbed the Manhattan of Madrid for its towering apartments and proximity to the capital, where 30,000 people were due to live. Loneliness of the long-distance ruuner: A jogger in the shadows runs past empty apartment blocks in Sesena, a 45-minute drive south of Madrid, where 30,000 people were due to live . Of the 13,000 homes due to be built, only 5,100 were completed - most of them now uninhabited and the Spaniards who bought them as investments now competing to offload them for huge losses. Spain's housing market crash and economic implosion have turned what was supposed to become a vibrant suburban paradise for young Spanish couples and their children into one of the most visible monuments of the country's boom gone bust. Such modern-day ghost towns have become a familiar part of the Spanish landscape, abandoned shells left to slowly decay. The number of foreclosure proceedings skyrocketed during the economic crisis. Barren plains: Landscaped areas, which were due to be built on, lie . vacant on the outskirts of ghost town Sesena as the Spanish housing . crisis continues to take its hold . Nearly 530,000 were granted by courts from 2008 through September of 2011, most to banks taking homes, housing developments and vast tracts of land for residential and commercial real estate projects that may never become reality. The banks were ordered this month by the recently elected centre-right government to set aside billions of additional euros to cover these toxic real estate assets valued at 175billion euro just as Spain teeters on the edge of what could be a lengthy recession. Spain now has more than 5million people (22.9 per cent of its residents) out of work - and recent growth data suggests the situation is only going to get worse. The country's economy shrank, by 0.3 per cent, for the first time in two years in the fourth quarter of 2011. Economists believe it is the start of what could be a prolonged slump as Madrid implements harsh austerity measures to deflate a massive budget deficit. The country already has the highest unemployment figure in Europe. RBS economist Nick Matthews said: 'Some countries in the eurozone may just avoid a recession, but that may be more difficult for Spain. 'Given the need for fiscal consolidation in the country and the pressure that puts on domestic demand, it’s going to be very difficult for Spain to avoid recession.' Economic output in the 17-nation single currency area fell 0.3 per cent in the fourth quarter from the third, official data showed yesterday as the sovereign debt crisis crushed a recovery and looked set to push the bloc in to a mild recession. The Italian economy joined Belgium, Greece and Portugal in formal recession having already shrunk in the third quarter of 2011. Purchasing data from Markit for January showed a slight improvement for the Spanish manufacturing and services industries, but it may not be enough for an economy that has been in recession or close to stagnation for almost five years. Spain had been growing at an above-average rate since the country entered into the eurozone monetary union 12 years ago, but the boom was largely due to the housing expansion fuelled by cheap loans and has been struggling since the 2007 crash. Experts say the government's new provisions for real estate holdings will almost certainly prompt the banks to sell holdings at firesale prices, forcing property values down much more than the 22 per cent that they have dropped since the financial crisis hit Europe in 2008. In Sesena and other ghost developments around Spain, some banks are already trying to unload finished apartments at discounts of up to 50 per cent of their original prices. But that is hurting untold numbers of Spaniards who invested savings and took out big loans to buy property they thought they would be able to sell for more money or rent. Satellite cities that never ended up with populations are not Spain's only problem. Around Madrid and across the country, there are vast subdivisions carved out of farmland complete with paved roads and streetlights but only weeds where houses were supposed to be built. Half-built apartment buildings stand idle in suburbs rich and poor. With unemployment at a eurozone high of 23 per cent, there are simply fewer buyers - and young Spaniards are increasingly trying to find work abroad. In December alone, sales were down 25.3 per cent compared to the same month in 2010, the government reported last Friday. 'This is the problem: Who is going to buy these homes?' said Jose Luis Alvarez Arce, head of the economics department at the University of Navara. It could take years for the banks to clean up their assets and relieve a growing credit crunch affecting individuals and businesses, some of whom never got caught up in the Spanish real estate craze in which most citizens bought real estate as an alternative to savings accounts, investment funds and retirement plans. The boom and bust has been so profound that the impact is changing the Spanish mentality about real estate, said Fernando Encinar, head of research at Spain's most popular real estate website, Idealista.com. Younger Spaniards, he said, for the first time do not believe parents who have told them for decades that they should always buy instead of rent and treat real estate as an investment that will never go bad. The age-old saying in Spain that prices never go down or not for long 'is now broken', Encinar said. No neighbours: One resident of Sesena bought a three-bedroom apartment with a terrace for 185,000 euro but is now stuck in a city that has no public transport or even a pharmacy . 'We're starting to see people who must sell with losses they would have never accepted in the past,' Encinar said. 'And some of these homes are never going to be sold.' Spain's development ministry estimates there are 687,000 unsold new homes for sale. Other studies put the number as high as 1.6million in the nation of 47million, where 80 per cent of the population already lives in owned homes, a rate much higher than nations like France, Germany, Italy and the United States. There is no government figure for used homes for sale, but estimates range into the millions. The value that the banks put on the property just isn't real,' Alvarez said. 'And as a result the banks don't trust each other, they aren't lending to each other and if they don't lend to each other there's no credit for Spaniards.' Juan Carlos Caballero bought his three-bedroom Sesena apartment with a terrace overlooking the residents' pool in 2008 for 185,000 euro after his retired father jumped into the real estate action to buy the same style of apartment at a lower pre-construction price. Landlord's nightmare: A chauffeur who bought a property in Sesena has dropped his rental value by a third but said finding anybody to move in 'like winning the lottery' Father and son were both convinced housing prices would continue to rise as they had since the mid-1990s. They now are stuck with homes in a development that does not have a pharmacy or good public transport to Madrid. The only pizza restaurant is open just three nights a week and on Saturday afternoon when there are enough clients to justify operating, and the roast chicken takeaway only opens Friday nights and Saturday afternoons. Apartment blocks have ground floor commercial space for small businesses so people can walk to buy whatever they need. But most units are sealed by brick walls scrawled with cell phone numbers of owners offering to sell or rent them. Tough decisions: Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is having to implement massive budget cuts to save the country from bankruptcy . The 33-year-old Caballero, an unemployed chauffeur, last rented his apartment for 750 euro a month two years ago, and is now asking just 500 euro per month. Similar apartments are being offered at 375 euro monthly, but he is asking for more because his is in immaculate condition with new furniture and appliances. His father, Jesus, is offering his apartment for sale at 108,000 euro, meaning he stands to lose tens of thousands of euros in a bid for retirement cash now that he's reached age 67. But banks selling foreclosed property in Sesena have smaller apartments listed as low as  65,000 euro. 'Selling or renting now is like winning the lottery,' said the younger Caballero, who lives with his parents and shells out 500  euro of his 700 euro monthly unemployment cheque to pay his mortgage and other apartment costs. In the town of Yebes more than an hour's drive from Madrid, 9,000 apartments and small houses were supposed to be built in a bucolic country setting next to a high-speed train station so workers could get downtown in less than 20 minutes. But only 1,500 were finished before developers went broke, 3,000 people live there instead of the projected 30,000 and government officials never launched the train service. 'The station is built, the trains are bought but they never started running,' said Mayor Joaquin Ormazabal. The 240,000 euro home he bought would now sell for about half the price.

"Japanese technology giant Honda unveiled their first robot nearly 30 years ago. While innovative for its time, the model, dubbed E0, was little more than a pair of metal legs  and could take five seconds to complete a single step. Since then the robot has come a long way - undergoing a series of developments and redesigns that have made it slicker, faster and more robust. And this week Honda showcased its latest offering: a talking, smiling robot friend named Asimo that can play football, climb the stairs - and even pour you a drink. Scroll down for video . From slow to slick: The E0 robot, left, unveiled in 1986, could take up to five minutes to complete a single step. Since then, Honda have released a series of redesigns - culminating in the latest Asimo, pictured right . Honda's humanoid robot, ascends a staircase as it makes its UK debut at the WIRED Conference in London . New look: In 1991, Honda added some colour to their robot when they unveiled the 'E4' (left). Two years later, arms were added to create the P1 (centre). While the P3, debuted in 1997, looks a lot more like the Asimo . Asimo – which stands for Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility – is eventually intended to help people in various situations of need, such as the elderly, or those in disaster zones. The latest version of the robot made its UK debut at the WIRED conference in London on Thursday, during a demonstration that showed off his skills with both balls and drinks. He is 'a little bit of a show-off', according to Vikki Hood, of Honda Motor Europe, who helped Asimo showcase his remarkable range of talents. Asimo has 34 motors to help him perform different types of human movement – such as tilting, balancing and navigating – including a sensor in his wrist which tells him to release a grip. Using the visual information captured by the two cameras in its head, Asimo can detect the movement of multiple objects, assessing distance and direction. Standing at 4.3 feet (1.3 metres) the gentle-handed robot can also hold a soft paper cup to pour liquid without squashing it. It can also predict the direction a person will walk and instantly take an alternate path to avoid a collision. 'He absolutely loves the audience response to what he can do.' Honda began the project in 1986, when they created the E0 robot, which had no torso and took up to 5 seconds to complete a single step. In comparison, the new ASIMO can run at up to 9km an hour. Asimo has 34 motors to help him perform different types of human movement – such as tilting, balancing and navigating – including a sensor in his wrist which tells him to release a grip. It can even recognise the faces and voices of multiple people speaking simultaneously. Using the visual information captured by the two cameras in its head, Asimo can detect the movement of multiple objects, assessing distance and direction. Its human-like hands can open a bottle, pour a drink and carry goods while also expressing sign language. Standing at 4.3 feet (1.3 metres) the gentle-handed robot can also hold a soft paper cup to pour liquid without squashing it. During the demonstration, Asimo climbed stairs, ran in a circle and switched from running, walking and hopping without stopping - something his predecessor could not do. On the head son! Asimo can even kick a football using his updated physique . It can also predict the direction a person will walk and instantly take an alternate path to avoid a collision. Smiley-faced Asimo speaks English and Japanese and can carry a tray, push a cart and even play football. It is also equipped with technology that enables it to maintain its balance even if its gently pushed or pulled. 34 motors allow Asimo to move, and dance, like a human . The robot is powered by a 51.8v lithium ion (Li-ION) battery and can operate for approximately 40 minutes on a single charge. Parts of the technology developed by Honda for the Asimo project have been used to help clean-up efforts at the stricken Japanese nuclear plant Fukushima, but in the humanoid robot, upgrades have focused on making Asimo better understand the world around himself. Without giving any time targets for when he might actually be available for domestic use, Hood admitted 'we still have a long way to go before introducing Asimo into the home – we do not put a fixed time line on it'. Engineers are working on improving his physical capabilities, his dexterity and his ability to lift weight so that he can be helpful in the home. Hood said: 'There is still a lot of work that needs to be done around people's acceptance of robots and identifying what their role in society will be. 'For us as a Japanese company, and looking at Japan where it has an ageing population, we see Asimo as perhaps helping to look after your elderly parents who live with you, helping your children with their homework and also helping with the daily chores.' She did not rule out that Asimo might one day be available from an electronic shop alongside other domestic appliances. He is 'a little bit of a show-off', according to Vikki Hood, of Honda Motor Europe, who helped Asimo showcase his skills. Earlier the year, Satoshi Shigemi, chief engineer, Asmio, said: 'For the first time in Europe, Honda is demonstrating the all-new Asimo- the latest generation of Honda's remarkable research into humanoid robotics. 'Previous generations of Asimo have demonstrated incredible fluidity and speed of movements. 'The all-new Asimo takes this mobility, task performing ability and interaction with people to the next level and moves Honda one step closer to its ultimate goal of developing a robot that can be a helper to people in need.' Honda said that Asimo is still in development and there are no existing plans to commercialise the robot.","Japanese technology giant Honda unveiled first robot nearly 30 years ago .

"Mile Jedinak admits it is becoming difficult for Crystal Palace players to come to terms with recent refereeing decisions which have gone against the club. The Eagles' skipper was sent off in the 3-1 reverse to Sunderland on Monday night after seeing his side have two legitimate penalty claims turned away by referee Phil Dowd. Santiago Vergini was lucky to avoid conceding a first-minute penalty when he brought down Fraizer Campbell, with Patrick van Aanholt tangling with Wilfried Zaha in what could have been easily given as a spot-kick. VIDEO: Scroll down for Neil Warnock's views on his side's penalty claims on Monday night . Mile Jedinak (left) was shown a second yellow card for a challenge on Jordi Gomez late in the match . Jedinak is sent off by referee Phil Dowd for his second bookable offence of the night . The Crystal Palace skipper leaves the pitch at Selhurst Park on what was a miserable night for the home night . As it turned out neither were given and Steven Fletcher put the Black Cats ahead before the break and, despite Palace drawing level courtesy of a Wes Brown own goal, Jordi Gomez and Fletcher struck either side of Jedinak's red card to seal a second Barclays Premier League win of the campaign. 'I think we gave them two soft goals,' said Jedinak. 'Apart from that I thought we were really good. 'I think they (the penalty claims) were both pretty clear to be honest with you, so, there's not a lot I'm going to comment on in that sense, but he (Dowd) made both decisions and we have taken the brunt of them. It was unfortunate - both times. Fraizer Campbell goes down under a challenge by Santiago Vergini but the home side did not get a penalty . Neil Warnock was unhappy with the decision not to award a penalty and made his feelings known to Dowd . 'It's disappointing when you don't receive the decisions and particularly so early on, particularly when you're on top. You're not going to cry over that, but when they are that obvious it's a little bit difficult.' The defeat saw Palace drop to 17th in the table, with only a better goal record keeping Neil Warnock's side outside of the relegation zone. The 65-year-old revealed after the match that Jedinak had apologised for his sending off and labelled the two bookings as 'silly' - with the Australia midfielder now ruled out of Saturday's trip to Manchester United. 'He (Dowd) decided to give me a yellow on the first one which for whatever reason, the second one I got caught in him it looked like he was right behind me and he's deemed it a yellow card,' Jedinak added. 'I've got to accept that now, I'm disappointed within myself to be missing the game and not being a part (of it) with the boys on Saturday. Sunderland manager Gus Poyet (left) congratulates two-goal hero Steven Fletcher after the Black Cats victory . 'We've got a game in five days' time, everybody has got to be ready and prepared. It's an opportunity for somebody else to step in and whoever is fit and available to be ready and I think the boys are going to give a good account of themselves. I have no doubt about that.' The win at Selhurst Park was Sunderland's second of the season and manager Gus Poyet will be hoping the result banishes the embarrassment of an 8-0 thrashing at Southampton two weeks ago. Gomez grabbed his first league goal for the Wearsiders since his summer move from Wigan and the Spaniard is hoping to build on the victory when they welcome Everton to the Stadium of Light on Sunday. 'It's a very good result for us,' he said. 'It was much needed and it's an important three points on the board. I'm very happy to get my goal but more so with the team performance and final result. 'We're now looking forward to playing at home on Sunday in front of the fans, turn in another performance and get another three points. 'Our fans were brilliant. It has been tough for them lately after the last two results but they backed us in their numbers and they deserve to enjoy this result, they are very important for us and did us proud here.' One downside on the evening for Sunderland was a shoulder injury suffered by Van Aanholt during his challenge with Zaha. The former Chelsea full-back was taken straight to hospital and Poyet confirmed after the match that the Dutchman had suffered a dislocation.","Mile Jedinak was sent off by referee Phil Dowd for two bookable offences during Crystal Palace's 3-1 home loss to Sunderland on Monday night .

"Actor Larry Lamb claims the GOPO supplement has banished the surging pain he felt in his knees and hips when running . Determined to stay fit and healthy, actor Larry Lamb turned to running. Entering his sixth decade, the star of EastEnders and Gavin and Stacey fame, laced up his trainers once more. Having suffered painful back ache in his younger years, the now 67-year-old has for the last decade religiously performed half-an-hour of stomach crunches every day to ensure his core was taught to relieve any strain on his back. But at the age of 60, with his back pain 'well and truly under control', he began to suffer twinges and burning sensations surging through his knees and hips. Refusing to give in to the pain. he experimented to try and ease his discomfort. Despite shelling out for proper running shoes and enduring daily doses of raw cod liver oil, the pain persisted. It wasn't until Larry happened upon an article outlining a new drug-free supplement, that he found his answer. GOPO is a supplement, containing a unique part of a rose hip, which helps tackle joint pain. It claims to be the only product of its kind to contain a high level of GOPO - a key component of the rose hip, which is thought to play a valuable role in the care of joints and joint tissues. And the supplement contains high levels of vitamin C, which is thought to boost the immune system and help the body form collagen, which aids joints. Larry told MailOnline: 'It has changed my life. I have to say, it's just incredible.' Around 26 million people across the UK suffer back pain, with many more afflicted by joint inflammation and damage. A recent survey found 90 per cent of people suffering back pain rely on paracetamol to ease their agony. It comes as another piece of research, published in The Lancet, concluded the painkiller is no better than a placebo at speeding recovery. It has prompted experts to call for a change in the advice given, to consider whether it is appropriate to recommend paracetamol as a treatment for back pain. Scroll down for video . Having been active throughout his life to combat back pain, when he took up running again in his early 60s, Larry started to suffer sharp pain in his knees and hips. 'In my early 60s I started to notice problems with my hips – just the occasional twinge here and there – and like most, I ignored the pains and got on with it,' he said. 'However, my left foot, back and knees also started to give me gyp - especially my back, which was becoming increasingly painful and stiff. I've always lived a very active life and I put my aches and pains down to my age and the travelling I do for work.' Larry recently toured around Europe and Tunisia for a Channel 5 programme exploring and telling the story of the birth of the Roman Republic. The 67-year-old star of Gavin and Stacey took up running again in his early 60s determined to stay fit and healthy. But for the first time in his life he was struck by niggling joint ache . Larry, who played Archie Mitchell in Eastenders, told MailOnline that after trying proper running shoes and various supplements, including daily doses of raw cod liver oil,  he discovered GOPO, made from rosehip . Determined not to slow down, the father-of-four, who revealed he does stomach crunches for an half-an-hour every day to keep his abs in shape, said he realised he needed to invest more time and care looking after himself. After buying hi-tech running shoes, but still suffering the pain, he turned to various supplements. He said: 'I'm conscientious about my health, as an older father (his youngest daughters are 11 and 15) it is your job to run around after your children even if your body is telling you otherwise. 'I've never been one for extreme sports, but I did start running six years ago in a bid to look after myself a bit better. 'However, I had to put it to one side as my knees worsened and the pain became unbearable.It was a pain I have never felt before. Larry said the rose hip supplement has 'changed my life' and since taking it he has suffered no pain at all . 'It dawned on me that a hip or joint replacement at my age was a possibility, but it was something I desperately wanted to avoid.' The 67-year-old first tried cod liver oil, taking it in its raw form, but admitted: 'there's no charm in cod liver oil'. But after reading an article by Arlene Phillips, a past judge on Strictly Come Dancing, Larry said he learned of the supplement GOPO. The clinically-proven supplement is specially cultivated from natural rose hip. It also claims to be the only product of its kind to contain high levels of GOPO - the key rose hip component which is thought to play a valuable role in the care of joints and joint tissues. Larry said: 'It has changed my life. I have to say, it's just incredible.' Since starting the supplement three months ago, he said he has not felt one twinge or shooting pain, 'not even one', he added. 'I started taking GOPO after hearing that rose hip works wonders for joint pain – and I can honestly say I have never felt better. 'Within six weeks I noticed a difference, and it definitely helped me scramble across the Roman Ruins. 'Not only has GOPO eradicated the pain I had in my hips and knees, it has also improved my overall wellbeing; I now feel ready to take on my next physical challenge. 'Now my joints are so supple, if I didn't have two left feet, I'd put my name down for Strictly Come Dancing!' And his are sentiments backed up by the professionals. Dr Rod Hughes, consultant rheumatologist at St Peter's Hospital in Surrey, said drug-free alternatives to painkillers are effective in treating back pain. He told MailOnline: 'There is a large body of evidence supporting the use of GOPO - a compound derived from rose hip - in musculoskeletal conditions, with research indicating that it can effectively relieve acute exacerbations of chronic back pain. 'The natural anti-inflammatory properties of GOPO make it a viable replacement to paracetamol in cases of non-specific lower back pain, without the risk of harmful side effects.' GOPO Joint Health is the only product of its kind to contain GOPO - a key component of the rose hip, which is thought to ease joint pain . GOPO is made from 100 per cent specially cultivated natural rose hip. It is the only product of its kind to contain a high level of GOPO - a key component of the rose hip, which is thought to play a valuable role in the care of joints and joint tissues. Rosehip contains a high concentration of Vitamin C - 50 per cent more than oranges. It makes rose hip very effective at boosting the immune system, is commonly used to help treat colds. Vitamin C is also essential for the normal collagen formation, needed to promote health bones and cartilage. It contains powerful antioxidants which act to combat free radicals in the body, which trigger damage to the hips, joints and other areas of the body. The herbal medication is thought to have anti-inflammatory properties. It contains polyphenols and anthocyanins, which are thought to ease joint inflammation and prevent joint damage. GOPO was discovered more than 20 years ago in Denmark, and significant levels can only be gathered if the rose hips are dried using a special patented process. It has been available in Denmark for 10 years, and this year was launched in the UK. A pack of 120 5g tablets costs £17.99. Patients take four a day. And Professor Andrew Moore, a leading researcher in pain at the Churchill Hospital in Oxford, added: 'Paracetamol is far from an innocuous drug. 'There may be some patients who will benefit from its use, but they will be very few in number. 'Risk of harm will outweigh the benefit for those patients who are not getting pain relief.' Osteopath at Physical Balance Hampshire, Ian Harrison, added that GOPO helps reduce swelling, which causes joint pain. He said: 'While there are all sorts of back problems, pain is always the common denominator - if people can manage their pain, it will help them keep moving and that is key to breaking the back pain cycle. 'GOPO works to reduce swelling and the pain associated with it. 'We see a lot of patients with back pain but in many instances it may only be mild pain or it could be a reoccurring problem that could be self-managed. 'People should always check serious problems with a healthcare professional, but there are steps they can take on their own to avoid falling into the back pain trap.' A study published in The Lancet found paracetamol is no better than placebo in the treatment of low-back pain . A recent study published in The Lancet concluded that paracetamol is no better than a placebo at speeding recovery. The research questioned the universal endorsement of paracetamol as the first choice painkiller for low-back pain. Low-back pain is the leading cause of disability worldwide. National clinical guidelines universally recommend the painkiller as the first choice analgesic. The Paracetamol for Low-Back Pain study (PACE) randomly assigned 1,652 people, with an average age of 45 and suffering acute low-back pain, to receive four weeks of paracetamol. One group was assigned a regular dose, three times a day, another took the drug as needed, while a third group received a placebo. All participants were followed up after three months. No difference in the length of time it took participants to recover was found between the three groups. The study authors, said: 'Paracetamol also had no effect on short-term pain levels, disability, function, sleep quality, or quality of life.' Dr Christopher Williams, from the George Institute for Global Health at the University of Sydney, in Australia, said: 'Simple analgesics such as paracetamol might not be of primary importance in the management of acute lower back pain. 'The results suggest we need to reconsider the universal recommendation to provide paracetamol as a first-line treatment for low-back pain, although understanding why paracetamol works for other pain states but not low-back pain would help direct future treatments.'","Supplement GOPO contains rose hip which helps ease joint pain .

"Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock is set to escape further punishment from the FA following his rant after Monday night's defeat by Sunderland. The south London club were denied a clear penalty inside the opening 25 seconds after Santiago Vergini fouled Fraizer Campbell in the box. Warnock was furious with the decision and let his feeling be known after the clash saying: 'I think everyone knows it's a penalty, the referee says he hasn't seen it, but he is in a great position.

"There is clear scientific evidence that the benefits of circumcision outweigh the risks, a landmark report has declared. A debate has long raged over the ethics of the procedure - and some men believe it has affected their sexual function or satisfaction. But U.S. officials have now said the medical evidence supports having the procedure. The announcement came in new long-awaited draft guidelines released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This is the first time the U.S. Government has released such a report on circumcision, where the foreskin around the tip of the penis is cut away. Guidelines: U.S. medical experts have declared there is now clear medical evidence to support circumcision . While the guidelines stop short of telling parents to get their newborn sons circumcised, they are very clear on the health advantages. 'That is a personal decision that may involve religious or cultural preferences', said the CDC's Dr. Jonathan Mermin, who oversees the agency's programs on HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. The procedure is done because germs can grow underneath the foreskin. CDC officials say circumcision can lower a man's risk of sexually-transmitted diseases, penile cancer and even urinary tract infections. The new guidelines are the result of seven years of work, after a cluster of influential studies in Africa indicated circumcision might help stop spread of the AIDS virus. 'The benefits of male circumcision have become more and more clear over the last ten years,' said Dr Aaron Tobian, a Johns Hopkins University researcher involved in one of the African studies. But the guidelines are important, because the rates of newborn male circumcision have been dropping, he added. In the new guidelines, the CDC says there is now strong evidence that male circumcision can: . Studies have not shown that circumcision will reduce an HIV-infected man's chances of spreading the AIDS virus to women. And research has not found circumcision to be a help in stopping spread of HIV during gay sex. The guidelines say circumcision is safer for newborns and infants than for older males, noting the complication rate rises from 0.5 per cent in newborns to nine per cent in children ages one to nine. Minor bleeding and pain are the most common problems, experts say. CDC officials are recommending doctors tell parents of baby boys of the benefits and risks of circumcision - but does not detail how that information should be presented. Because circumcision can be beneficial to men as well, the CDC says information about the procedure also should be given to sexually active uncircumcised men - especially men considered to be at higher risk of catching HIV, the report says. However the guidelines, which the public will be able to comment on for the next 40 days, are likely to draw intense opposition from anti-circumcision advocacy groups. 'This is a passionate issue for them and they feel strongly that circumcision is wrong,' said Dr Douglas Diekema, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Washington. The thinking on circumcision has swung wildly over the years. While it has been practiced by Jews and Muslims for thousands of years, it didn't become common in the U.S. until the 20th century. Controversial: The new guidelines, which state how the procedure can cut risk for HIV, STDs and penile cancer, are expected to draw intense opposition from anti-circumcision advocacy groups . By one estimate, only 25 per cent of U.S. male newborns were circumcised in 1900. It gradually became the cultural norm, and in the 1950s and 1960s surpassed 80 per cent. But then the trend reversed. This was partly to do with changing demographics, as the U.S. population grew to include larger numbers of Mexican-Americans and other ethnic groups that didn't traditionally circumcise their children. Also, opposition to the procedure grew from advocates who decried the pain, bleeding and risk of infections to newborns, the Associated Press reports. Their message was aided by the Internet and by the neutral stance of physicians groups - including, for a time, the American Academy of Pediatrics. By 2010 the newborn circumcision rate was down to about 58 per cent, according to one CDC estimate. But even as the circumcision rate dropped, more medical evidence came in supporting it - particularly three rigorous and influential studies in Africa that looked at the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases in circumcised and uncircumcised men and their partners.","Brief procedure involves cutting away the foreskin around tip of the penis .

"Beach baby: Kate did take George with her on holiday to Mustique in January . The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are facing a public backlash for going on a second honeymoon without seven-month-old Prince George. The couple have flown to an exclusive resort on the Maldives, leaving their baby with Carole and Michael Middleton – plus his own security detail – at their Berkshire mansion. But the decision sparked a storm on social networking sites Mumsnet and Twitter. Critics said they were wrong to leave the young Prince for so long, while others were concerned about the extravagance of their stay only a few weeks after the whole family, including George, went to Mustique. The couple arrived at Cheval Blanc Randheli on Noonu Atoll, on Thursday for a week-long break. Packages there, including flights, can cost £6,799 a person. Some people questioned how Prince William, already condemned for boar hunting in Spain last month, was able to take time off from his ten-week agriculture management course at Cambridge University. One mother, who uses the blog name louloutheshames, posted on Mumsnet: ‘Seriously? Think this might turn public opinion against them .  .  . seems its just one long holiday for the D and D of Cambridge.’ Another blogger called crazy spaniel remarked: ‘Well they need a holiday – him to recover from the shooting holiday in Spain a couple of weeks ago, and her to recover from the Mustique holiday last month. I think she may even have put on a posh frock and “worked” for a couple of hours in between. No wonder they’re exhausted.’ Katienan wrote: ‘I like them but am shocked by this, just makes me think they are the same old royals .  .  . Can’t imagine choosing to be so far from my baby for so long,’ while another contributor said: ‘These two really p*** me off. 'Life’s one long holiday’. Frogwatcher42 added the ‘arrogant’ couple might ‘finally break the royal family’. Paradise: Hotel Cheval Blanc in the Maldives where the royal couple are enjoying a romantic break . However the couple also had some support. One mother of two said: ‘If the baby is in good hands, why not? He is first [grandson] for doting GPs [grandparents] and probably has a very competent nanny. If I could afford a holiday every few weeks without the baby, I’d take them too.’ Others said ‘each to their own’. Next month the Royal couple embark on a three-week tour of New Zealand and Australia – this time accompanied by George. Kensington Palace have declined to comment on a private holiday. YES says Karren Brady . Businesswoman and mother of two . As a mother she has been branded selfish, uncaring, shameful and unusual. What nonsense. The Duchess is none of those things. And, quite frankly, I believe she has made totally the right decision. When my daughter was seven months old I took her on holiday to America. I had more luggage than a family of ten, what with sterilisers, bottles, formula, nappies, every possible piece of medical equipment I might remotely require plus clothes, sun creams, prams, car seats, sun umbrellas and a selection of toys. She screamed the whole way there, so much so that I contemplated drinking my own body weight in red wine. The time difference played havoc with her body clock, and mine, and I found I’d left certain toys at home she wanted. It was possibly the most stressful week of my life. The truth is travelling with a baby, especially when aeroplanes are involved, is rarely a pleasant experience. 'You can only have a good time in the Maldives if you like the person you are with as, other than swim, sunbathe and eat, there is nothing to do' Kate, we are told, wants to spend . quality time with her husband, and I admire this because marriage, like . children, is a lifetime commitment and you have to work at being good at . it. And trust me, . I’ve been to the Maldives, and you can only have a good time if you like . the person you are with as, other than swim, sunbathe and eat, there is . nothing to do. The Duchess is being far from selfish. She has left her child with its loving and doting grandparents; she hasn’t dropped him off at Battersea Dogs Home. Nor is she uncaring – she has made a decision that her son is better off in his usual routine than being dragged to a small island in the heat. 'Kate is now a member of the Royal Family, and while their ways may seem formal to her, she has embraced them wholly and willingly' The truth is that as a predominantly . stay-at-home mum she spends many hours of quality time with her son, and . probably far less quality time with her busy husband. And while it’s probably true that, as one of the thoroughly  middle-class Middletons, her natural instinct may have been to rarely let her baby son out of her sight during his formative years, the fact is that Kate no longer resides among her own class. She is now a member of the Royal Family, and while their ways may seem formal to her, she has embraced them wholly and willingly. In the long term, George will benefit from her decision to make her marriage a priority because, as children will tell you, they are far happier in a household where both parents love each other than in a household where they do not. And this is a household where even a blind man can see there is much love. We also forget that Kate and William are young, newly wed, new parents and face a lifetime dedicated to public service, so we know that it’s not easy for them to avoid the media. We also know what happened the last time they went on holiday. Is it any wonder they have had to take over a whole island to ensure they get some privacy? My daughter will soon turn 18; she has no recollection of the nightmare trip to America. In the years between then and now there have been many business trips on which she has not accompanied me. My advice to Kate? Don’t let guilt hold you back. Fast forward to when George is 18. So, he didn’t go to the Maldives with you, and probably missed many other official trips besides. But he will have your strengths, your independence and will have benefited massively from the loving home you and his father are providing. In fact, he will be just fine. And who knows, maybe Kate and William are working on a little Princess! NO says Anne Atkins . Writer, Broadcaster and mother of five . When our second child was a few weeks old I accepted a weekend’s work with a theatre company. Wanting  to be professional, I left my baby at home. As soon as I arrived I realised my mistake. A child of that age will sleep through anything, she wouldn’t have been any trouble and someone would have cuddled her if she’d woken while I was working. Her breastfeeding never fully recovered, and she was the only one  of our children  who needed bottles before she was weaned. This was something she minded very much when  I told her years later. Of course parents need time to themselves. When ours were young we would spend one evening  a week alone. But let’s face it: Kate and Wills are not going to be alone. If I was to be surrounded by security men, press officers and so on, I’d include a nanny or two and take my baby too. We have an odd trait in Northern Europe that  I call generational apartheid. Unlike those in more relaxed southern climes, we behave as if we really  don’t like our children. The couple arrived at Cheval Blanc Randheli (pictured) on Noonu Atoll, on Thursday for a week-long break. Packages there, including fights, can cost £6,799 a person . We park them with babysitters, send them upstairs when we have friends round. I sometimes wonder why  the British have children at all, we complain so much when they’re home for the holidays. And much as I love and admire the Queen, no reign is entirely without error, and I suspect hers perhaps came when her children were very young. For instance, leaving the young Charles and Anne behind when she went to Australia for two months. How did they cope, knowing their mother’s subjects came before they did? At school, I had a wonderful history teacher, Margaret Chamberlain. She often challenged our thinking, and  one day criticised Elizabeth I for not continuing the Tudor line. We leapt  to Good Queen Bess’s defence: she  was far too busy being a brilliant monarch. ‘But providing an heir,’  Mrs Chamberlain said, ‘is part of being a good monarch. By leaving no clear succession, she let her people down.’ Raising the next generation of Royals was part of Elizabeth II’s job. Considering the chaos they went on to make of their own relationships, this was perhaps not her finest hour. After that weekend without my baby, I never did it again. I took them all over the place: breastfeeding during  a lecture I gave, or over dinner after Question Time. Our youngest visited the Richard and Judy studio at three days old. I was far happier, and like  to think they were too. Of course Prince George’s grandparents are competent: that’s  not the point. How will the parents  feel if anything goes wrong and they can’t comfort him? Come on Kate! Your middle-class, nurturing family gave us more confidence than the Windsors. We don’t need you to be grand and cool. Take your babies (and nannies) with you next time, and enjoy yourself even more.","Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have flown to a resort on the Maldives .

"A cash-strapped mother-of-four has revealed that she is planning to fund Christmas by selling her breast milk. Rebecca Hudson, 26, from Manchester, appeared on This Morning and revealed that she has so far made £3,700. The entrepreneurial mother came up with the idea after realising that she was producing more milk than her youngest child Milly, now one, needed. Scroll down for video . Entrepreneurial: Rebecca Hudson, 26, from Manchester is selling her own breast milk . She sells the milk for £12.50 a bottle and has amassed a devoted group of eight clients, among them a bodybuilder. The Manchester mother also admitted that some clients purchase the milk to use for 'sexual purposes'. 'What they do with the milk is up to them,' she said. 'I'm not going to discriminate. There's no difference for anyone who wants to use the milk, from a bodybuilder to someone who wants to use it sexually.' She also used her appearance on the ITV flagship show to hit out at those who say drinking breast milk is revolting, saying that drinking the substance is completely 'natural'. Selling well: Ms Hudson says she has so far made £3,700 and has eight devoted clients . Not bothered: Ms Hudson says she has no problem with people using the milk for 'sexual purposes' 'Some think drinking breast milk is disgusting,' Ms Hudson explained. 'That's their problem. It's natural and full of vitamins.' She also revealed how much she makes from her unusual business. 'For a 5oz bottle, I would make £12.50,' she told a clearly impressed Philip Schofield. 'So for a usual pop can, that would be £27.50. I've made over £3,000. The exact figure is around £3,700 or something.' Ms Hudson isn't the first person to make a profit from breast milk. Mommy Milk Creations was set up by mother-of-three Allicia Mogavero earlier this year and uses the substance to make jewellery. Each piece is made by hand and takes up to five hours to create. Ms Mogavero then sells the jewels for $160 (£97) each. So popular has the company become, Ms Mogavero has a 12-month waiting list. Mothers can also pay to have their own breast milk used in the jewellery. Money-making: Another mother, Allicia Mogavero, has also hit on a novel way of monetising milk - jewellery .

"A prostitute has told a court of the moment her 'boyfriend' - and father of her child - shot dead a client, who was the grandson of Henry Ford. Dijana Kilic took the stand as the key witness connecting Danyell Thomas, 36, to the murder of John Dahlinger, 56, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in October last year. She told the jury at Kent County Circuit Court yesterday that Thomas - who also acted as her pimp - broke into her client's home, fired a shot and later confessed to shooting the victim in the head. Thomas denies murdering father-of-two Mr Dahlinger after he was unable to pay for Ms Kilic's services. Prostitute Dijana Kilic testified against her former pimp Danyell Thompson as part of her plea agreement . Danyell Thomas enters the courtroom on the third day of his trial in Grand Rapids, Michigan . John Dahlinger was found dead by his longtime fiancee Melanie Yanchuk at their Grand Rapids condo . If convicted, Thomas faces life in prison without parole for felony murder, conspiracy to commit armed robbery and felony use of a firearm. She described the 'sexless' encounters with Mr Dahlinger that led to his death, reported Michigan Live. 'I wasn't really thinking that day,' she said. 'I didn't really believe he'd come in with a gun.' Jurors heard Ms Kilic met businessman Mr Dahlinger, in the fall of 2013 when she saw him smoke crack in a group at a Northeast Side trailer park - and then again on October 8 after he contacted her through an ad online. Ms Kilic said he paid her nearly $1,000 for her time when they met at a hotel on 28th Street - but all they did was talk and use drugs. She admitted trying to slip a drug in his drink, but he did not pass out. In court, Ms Yanchuk wept as said she far as she knew Dahlinger, a father-of-two, did not use drugs or prostitutes . Danyell Thomas, left, is accused of murdering Dahlinger in October 2013. He was allegedly shot after he could not pay prostitute Dijana Kilic, right, after she performed a strip tease at his home . And when she met him a second time on October 16 - the night Mr Dahlinger died - it was Thomas who drove her home afterwards. This time, she gave him heroin with the hope he would pass out, but as she modeled underwear for him, he asked her to perform a sex act with a friend while he watched. She said she refused. During the encounter, she exchanged numerous text messages with the accused, who asked her repeatedly if Mr Dahlinger had money - indicating the pair planned to rob Mr Dahlinger and anyone else at the property. The texts allegedly sent from Ms Kilic suggest that Mr Dahlinger was waiting for one of his sons to bring money. And many of the messages from Thomas ended with the phrase 'FTP 2014' - which Ms Kilic said meant 'F*** the police'. She said Thomas then came in with a gun and pointed it at both her and at Mr Dahlinger. She claims she ran out of the room and the heard a single gunshot after Mr Dahlinger said the words: 'I didn't do anything'. As they drove home, she told the court Thomas confessed to the shooting, but said it was accidental. They then visited the Gun Lake Casino in Wayland in a bid to establish an alibi for the time of Mr Dahlinger's death. Ms Kilic told the court she began working as a stripper at the age of 20 and later stepped up to prostitution . She gave details about text messages exchanged between her and Thomas on the night Mr Dahligher died . In the messages shown to the court, the accused asked her repeatedly if Mr Dahlinger had money - indicating the pair planned to rob the businessman . The pair were arrested two weeks later and Ms Kilic's fingerprints were found all over the scene of the crime. Despite Thomas's please, Ms Kilic co-operated with the police and accepted a plea deal - which led to Thomas being charged with felony murder. After pleading guilty to armed robbery, she was sentenced to one year in prison - but only spent a few months in Kent County Jail, and agreed to testify against Thomas. She helped police officers recover a .357 magnum allegedly belonging to Thomas from a river - which was linked to bullet fragments recovered at the scene. As part of the plea agreement, her testimony cannot be used against her. The court heard she began working as a stripper at 20 and later moved to prostitution using a website where she would meet up with men. She insists she never had sexual intercourse with her client - even though her adverts claim she was 'very open minded' and 'aimed to please'. She said Thomas, who she lived with in North Wyoming, was OK with her sex work under those conditions. According to the Kent County Prosecutor's Office, part of the plea also deal included allowing Ms Kilic, a Bosnian immigrant, to stay in the country. Soon after the homicide, Ms Kilic found she was pregnant by Thomas and gave birth to his son. Barb Bechtel comforts John Dahlinger's son Mike during Danyell Thomas's murder trial yesterday .

Mr Dahlinger's late father has always claimed he was the illegitimate son of Henry Ford following an alleged affair the car manufacturer had with his young secretary. The victim's mother, Barbara Dahlinger - who was married to John Sr. - has previously confirmed the claim. 'Yes, my husband was the illegitimate son of Henry Ford,' she told Detroit News. 'So what if it's true? Everybody knew it back then. 'I lived it. My son lived it. And there's nothing to be gained by rehashing all this again. The Ford Motor Co. owes us nothing.'

"Wales manager Chris Coleman feels his players have 'grown up' after going top of their European Championship qualifying group. Coleman's side held talented Bosnia and Herzegovina to a goalless draw at the Cardiff City Stadium on Friday night to make it four points from two games as Belgium and Israel won their first games elsewhere in Group B. Wales now welcome Cyprus to Cardiff on Monday night and Coleman says it will have been a productive camp if they win that game and make it seven points from nine. Wales manager Chris Coleman reacts from the sidelines at the Cardiff City Stadium . Wales forward Gareth Bale races past Bosnia's Miralem Pjanic at Cardiff City Stadium . 'These players have grown up,' Coleman said about a team missing influential midfielders Aaron Ramsey and Joe Allen through injury but who almost grabbed a winner through Gareth Bale in the final seconds. 'They're not scared of it, they've accepted the compliment of being called the 'golden generation'. 'That's a huge compliment, I've told them they've got to earn it and they knew the pressure going into the game. 'There was a big crowd for a reason but they didn't disappoint. If we beat Cyprus I think it will have been a productive camp.' Over 30,000 turned up on the night as fans appeared to fall in love with their team again after several years where apathy has reigned in Welsh football. They saw Wales having to hold on for long periods as the Bosnians dominated midfield and goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey was forced to produce several outstanding saves to prevent the hosts from falling behind. But Wales rallied at the end and Bale - who was brilliantly denied by Stoke's Bosnian goalkeeper Asmir Begovic - Hal Robson-Kanu and Ashley Williams all had late chances to score. 'Gareth's chance was Scotland all over again, when he scored that fantastic late winner,' Coleman said, recalling a World Cup qualifier two years ago. Wales' Simon Church (centre) and Bosnia and Herzegovina's Toni Sunjic (left) battle for the ball . Wales goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey dives to make a save from Bosnia and Herzegovina's Haris Medunjanin . 'I thought he would get a chance but I didn't expect it to be from the same place, but it was a great save. 'We had other chances and it was a good point and a great performance. 'We had to ride our luck a little bit because they're a good team. 'You know against teams like that you have to do that because they have enough quality when they're on their game to hurt anybody. 'We had to stand up to the challenge and we matched them. Wayne pulled off some great saves and we had some chances at their end. 'They kicked us, we kicked them and it was a good old-fashioned international match. 'We never played our best football but we dug deep. In terms of putting it on the line, I felt our players didn't have anything more to give.' Coleman felt Bosnia midfielder Miralem Pjanic was fortunate to stay on the field after picking up a first-half booking for felling Jonathan Williams. Moments later Pjanic fouled Williams again but he escaped with only a lecture from the Russian referee Vladislav Bezborodov. 'We thought he could have been sent off,' Coleman said. 'On another day maybe, because he kicked him again seconds after the first challenge. Bosnia and Herzegovina's striker Edin Dzeko (R) runs with the ball during the Euro 2016 qualifier .

'We came here to get three points and we took some risks. 'The score is not bad for either team because they are our direct opponents for second place.

Moscow  dismantled its radar stations in Lourdes in 2001 as part of cutting back military installations abroad. The stations were built in 1964 after the 1962 Cuban missile crisis .

Around 1,500 Russian engineers, technicians and soldiers observed submarine activity from the base  built in 1964 . The signals intelligence facility near Havana at Torrens, also known as Lourdes, was the largest Russian SIGINT site abroad, but has been mothballed since 2001. It covered a 28 square-mile area with 1,000-1,500 Russian engineers, technicians, and military personnel working at the base. Russia had closed the Lourdes spy base south of Havana on Putin's orders to save money and due to a warming of relations with the U.S. after the September 11 attacks. But Moscow has since shown a new interest in Latin America and its Cold War ally Cuba and relations with the West have deteriorated amid the Ukraine crisis. The base was set up in 1964 after the Cuban missile crisis to spy on the United States. Just 155 miles from the U.S. coast, it was the Soviet Union's largest covert military outpost abroad with up to 3,000 staff.

Before that, both presidents participated together to a flower offering to the Sovietic International Soldier Mausoleum . It was used to listen in to radio signals including those from submarines and ships and satellite communications. 'All I can say is - finally!' one Russian source told Kommersant of the reported reopening. The defence ministry and military high command declined to comment on the report to Kommersant. Ahead of Putin's visit to Cuba last week as part of a Latin American tour, Russia agreed to write off 90 per cent of Cuba's debt dating back to the Soviet era, totalling around $32 billion. Russia paid Cuba rent of $200 million per year to use the base in the last few years it was open. A former head of Russia's foreign intelligence service, Vyacheslav Trubnikov, told the newspaper the base would strengthen Russia's international position. 'Lourdes gave the Soviet Union eyes in the whole of the western hemisphere,' he said. 'For Russia, which is fighting for its lawful rights and place in the international community, it would be no less valuable than for the USSR.' Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov was not immediately available for comment on Wednesday.","Facility at Lourdes was the largest Russian listening post abroad .

"Neil Warnock has revealed he failed in a bid to bring Tottenham striker Harry Kane to Crystal Palace at the start of the season. The Eagles boss takes his side to White Hart Lane on Saturday to face a Spurs team buoyed by the goals of Kane so far this campaign. The England Under 21 international has struck 11 goals for Mauricio Pochettino's men but has only established himself in Tottenham's Premier League side in the last month. Harry Kane (left) in action against Chelsea was a loan target for Crystal Palace last summer . Until then he was used sparingly as a substitute and restricted to playing a key role in the Europa League group stages - the main reason Warnock felt a loan move for Kane never got off the ground. 'I tried to get him a few times when I came here,' the 66-year-old said. 'He is a good lad and you know what you are going to get with him. He is an exciting player. His first thought when he gets the ball is positive and I like players like that, who commit defenders. He obviously enjoys it, you can tell by the smile on his face. He is a good asset. Eagles boss Neil Warnock was disappointed to miss out on England Under 21 international Kane . 'At the time, he was not involved and we felt there was a chance of getting him on loan. But unfortunately they were in that horrible cup on a Thursday night.' Kane came close to breaking the deadlock as Spurs lost 3-0 at league leaders Chelsea on Wednesday night and is likely to retain his place for the visit of Palace, who also go into the contest on the back of a defeat having lost 1-0 at home to Aston Villa. Midfielder Joe Ledley missed that game with a hip problem and is a doubt for the trip to Tottenham - as is defender Damien Delaney. Kane (left), pictured tussling with John Terry, has now established himself in Tottenham's first-team . Warnock admitted he has already drawn up a list of January transfer targets and, having missed out on Kane, it is a forward - with Andy Johnson and Kevin Doyle injured and Dwight Gayle replaced at half-time against Villa through illness - that he hopes to bring in. 'I think we know we haven't got enough fire-power,' he added. 'When you look at the other teams they have all got main strikers to select from. I think the lads are doing as well as they can. We do need improvement in that area and we are looking to address that in January.'","Crystal Palace attempted to sign Harry Kane on loan in August .

"For at least two years, Apple deleted songs from iPods that had been bought from rival music stores, according to accusations made in court. Each time an Apple user with non-iTunes music tried to sync their devices, between 2007 and 2009, the tech firm  urged them to restore the players to factory settings. And lawyers claim this was a deliberate move to wipe the rival files, and cause the users' music libraries to 'blow up.' Lawyers have claimed that each time a user with non-iTunes music tried to sync their phones and iPods, between 2007 and 2009 (Steve Jobs is pictured launching the 2009 iPod Nano), the tech firm urged them to restore their devices to factory settings. This is said to have been a deliberate move to wipe the rival files . Apple has been taken to court by individuals and businesses who accuse it of abusing its monopoly position in the digital music player market. The suit is being heard in a US district court in California, and is specifically looking into whether Apple tried to bolster its iPod and iTunes market between 2007 and 2009. The plaintiffs are seeking $350 million (£223 million) in damages, claiming that Apple’s behaviour forced them to pay more for songs and hardware. And under antitrust laws in the US, if the case is successful, these damages could rise to as much as $1 billion (£638 million). This isn't the first time Apple has been in trouble for controlling music on devices. Earlier this year, the firm automatically added U2's Songs of Innocence album to millions of iOS devices without permission. In total, the album was added to iTunes Store customers in 119 countries. Users took to Twitter and Facebook to express outrage at the plans and many moaned the album was difficult to remove from their devices. In response, the tech giant  now created a dedicated page that lets users remove the album by signing in with their Apple ID . Reports claim Apple paid the band $100 million as part of the deal. The lawyers argue Apple set up a campaign to make sure its iPods only included music bought directly from the firm’s proprietary store. Attorney Patrick Coughlin said: ‘You guys decided to give them the worst possible experience and blow up’ a user’s music library.’ But Apple insisted that the move was a legitimate security measure. Security director Augustin Farrugia said in court that his company was protecting users from hackers and malware by removing MP3s downloaded from outside of iTunes. He continued that the warning message, which instructed users about the factory reset, was kept ‘vague’ to prevent confusion. And any updates that wiped libraries were only intended to keep the devices clean and safe. Apple is also accused of inflating the prices of its iPods by almost $350 million (£223 million). Apple declined to comment on legal proceedings. Later this week, Apple executives including Eddy Cue and Phil Schiller will testify in the case, in addition to a video testimony recorded by co-founder Steve Jobs before he died in 2011. Mr Jobs once referred to music pirates as ‘someone breaking into our house’.

"Will.i.am led the charge of celebrities supporting then-senator Barack Obama on his run for the White House in 2008. Seven years later, it appears the Black Eyed Peas singer is reconsidering whether his efforts were worth it. In an interview with Larry King, previewed in a clip shared with Buzzfeed, will.i.am said he is 'disappointed' with the current administration and the sentiment is reflected in his despondent facial expressions. Scroll down for video . Not happy: Black Eyed Peas singer will.i.am said he was disappointed in President Barack Obama, in a preview of his interview with Larry King . How do you feel? When Larry King (left) asked the singer (right) to assess Mr Obama's time in the White House, he said: 'It would have been hard for anyone' More to be revealed: Larry King's full interview with will.i.am will air December 11 at 5pm on Ora.Tv . During the interview, which will air in full on December 11, Larry King points out all the work the musician did on both of Mr Obama's campaigns and then asks him to assess his presidency. Will.i.am pauses several seconds before saying: 'It would have been hard for anyone'. When asked directly if he is disappointed, will.i.am at first struggles to answer the question but eventually settles and admits that he is let down by Mr Obama. Like many presidents before him, Barack Obama is facing exceptionally low approval ratings as he enters his final year in the White House. He even admitted that Americans are 'ready to trade him in' for a candidate with a 'new car smell' in an interview with ABC News last month. But will.i.am's disenchantment shows that Mr Obama is losing the support of even his biggest fans. Will.i.am produced several songs in support of Mr Obama when he was running for the White House in 2008. The two pictured above following an event at Ohio State University in  October  2012 . Will.i.am's video for the song 'Yes We Can' featured several celebrities and went on to be viewed more than four million times on YouTube. Pictured above with the president in the Oval Office in February 2010 . Will.i.am was one of Mr Obama's secret weapons in capturing the youth vote for his 2008 campaign, volunteering to produce an album in support of the candidate called Change is Now: Renewing America's Promise. The first single off the album, Yes We Can, featured Mr Obama's speech following the New Hampshire presidential primary election and appearances by a slew of celebrities including Scarlett Johansson, John Legend and Nick Cannon. The song went on to garner over four million views on YouTube and win a daytime Emmy award. Another single featured another array of celebrities changing 'O-BA-MA'. Will.i.am is best known as a founding member of the hip-hop group Black Eyed Peas, but lately he has been focusing on his own music, releasing a new song last July. He is also set to be a coach when The Voice singing competition show starts in Australia this year.","The Black Eyed Peas singer worked on both of Mr Obama's presidential campaigns .

"Sergio Aguero is not just top of this season's Premier League scoring charts. The Argentine, having now played 101 times in the English top flight, has far and away the lowest minutes per goal ratio in Premier League history. Aguero hits the net on average once every 108 minutes, 13 minutes quicker than Arsenal legend Thierry Henry. He is arguably in the greatest form of his career, with 14 goals already this term, and bagged a double in Manchester City's 4-1 win at Sunderland on Wednesday night. Sergio Aguero scored twice for Manchester City against Sunderland on Wednesday night . Aguero has a goal every 108 minutes in the Premier League, quicker than any other player . With as many goals as games this season, Aguero is on course to beat Cristiano Ronaldo's record (in a 38-game season) of 31 goals in the 2007-08 season. The full table, shown below, charts striker's records who have played over 100 games in the top flight, with Aguero miles ahead of the pack after a century of appearances. In 7126 minutes he has 66 goals, ahead of Henry and 20 minutes quicker than former Manchester United hit man Ruud van Nistelrooy. Aguero drives home Manchester City's first goal to equalise at the Stadium of Light in their 4-1 win . Thierry Henry scored 175 goals in 258 games during his two stints at Arsenal . Luis Suarez, who left Liverpool in the summer, scored 69 goals in 110 appearances . Javier Hernandez played just one game more than Aguero, but nearly 2,500 less minutes at Manchester United. His 37 goals, mainly as a substitute, puts him fourth in the list with a goal every 129.6 minutes.

"Alexis Sanchez has been a 'breath of fresh air' at Arsenal, with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain praising his team-mate for bringing a winning mentality back to the club. A big-money summer arrival from Barcelona, the 25-year-old has hit the ground running in north London with a remarkable return of 14 goals from 22 appearances. Those displays have helped spare Arsenal's blushes on several occasions, including Wednesday's Barclays Premier League encounter at home to surprise package Southampton. Alexis Sanchez netted a late winner for Arsenal in Wednesday's game with Southamton . It took a last-gasp Sanchez strike to see off the well-drilled visitors 1-0, after which Oxlade-Chamberlain heaped praise on the game-changing Chile forward. 'There is no rest for him,' the England midfielder told BT Sport. 'On recovery days he wants to be playing and he is not happy if he is not allowed to play the game at the end. 'In training, he wants to win. He has brought that winning mentality to the side and I think it definitely rubs off on a lot of players. 'It has been an eye-opener for me. To make it to the top and to be able perform like he does week in, week out you have got to be an absolute winner and you never want to lose at all. Sanchez fires home the winner as Arsenal claim all three points against Southampton . 'He is not happy when he doesn't score. If I scored as many goals as he has at this stage, I'd be over the moon. 'He has been brilliant for us and a breath of fresh air, so hopefully he can stay in the form that he is in and we can help him out to keep producing goals like he has been.' As good as Sanchez is, though, Oxlade-Chamberlain - like anyone else in attendance at the Emirates Stadium - will be aware Arsenal need to improve and quick. This was a far from convincing display from Arsene Wenger's men and one which left Saints defender Toby Alderweireld cursing his luck. A first-half injury to Jack Cork saw the Belgian moved from centre-back to holding midfield for the second match in a row - a role he impressed in until a hamstring injury forced him off with less than 10 minutes remaining. Saints had already used their full complement of substitutions by that point and Sanchez capitalised on the fact Saints had to end the game a man light. 'It's really s***,' Alderweireld said. 'I think everybody knows when it happens with your hamstring you can't run any more, so with pain in my heart I had to go off. Sanchez shows off his skills by looking one way and playing a long pass in the other direction . 'That was really s*** and, unfortunately, we let a goal in. 'On Thursday I will have a scan and I hope it's not too serious, but for sure a hamstring is always bad, so we'll see. 'I'm hoping to recover very soon, very fast. I will do everything to be back very quickly on the field, but that's for the future and I can't tell.' Injuries to Alderweireld, Cork and Dusan Tadic made this a costly defeat for Saints - hardly the ideal preparation for Monday's match against Manchester United. It is a game they not only approach low on numbers but fresh from back-to-back losses for the first time this season. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has hailed the impact of Sanchez since he joined Arsenal . Saints have only been beaten four times in all competitions during their remarkable start, yet those reverses have come against Liverpool, Tottenham, Manchester City and Arsenal. The latest defeat will only fuel the doubters' suggestions that Saints are only third in the standings due to a kind fixture list, but such talk angered Alderweireld. 'Maybe last week we were not that good, but today we played very good against a good team, especially here, where it's very difficult to play,' he said. 'I think we played very good and I think we deserved a point at least. 'They have to watch the game. Maybe after Sunday, City (3-0 home defeat), we didn't play that good, but today we played very good, so we're still there and we will work very hard to get the points again, so we will do our best.'","Alexis Sanchez scored a late winner for Arsenal against Southampton .

"Norway starlet Martin Odegaard enjoyed a training session with Liverpool's first-team on Thursday as Brendan Rodgers continues to plot a move for the talented 15-year-old. The Stromsgodset midfielder, who has already spent time with Real Madrid and Manchester United - although United hope to see him again - landed on Merseyside to take a look at Liverpool's ground and facilities on Wednesday. But his trip turned into a trial of sorts when he was given the opportunity to impress Rodgers and his potential team-mates during the session at Melwood. VIDEO Scroll down for 15-year-old Norwegian wonder kid Martin Odegaard highlights . Stromsgodset starlet Martin Odegaard enjoyed a training session with Liverpool's first-team on Thursday . The 15-year-old was the youngest player to feature in a Euro qualifier after making his debut against Bulgaria . Age: 15 (D.O.B. 17/12/98) Born: Drammen, Norway . Position: Attacking midfielder . Club: Stromsgodset (2014-) Appearances: 24 . Goals: 5 . International appearances: 3 . International goals: 0 . Liverpool's first team squad and staff were given the day off on Wednesday but midfielder Odegaard, supposedly a fan of the Anfield club, and his father took the opportunity to look around the stadium, Melwood and Liverpool city centre. After the training session, Reds defender Kolo Toure told Norway's TV2 how impressed he was with the youngster. He said: 'I met him (Odegaard) today and he is a very good player. 'He was good in training.' And when he was asked whether he wanted the Norwegian to join him at Anfield, he laughed and said: 'I don't know.' Odegaard already has three international caps after becoming the youngest player ever to play in a European Championship qualifier when he made his debut for Norway against Bulgaria at the age of 15 years and 300 days. He turns 16 on December 17. Most of Europe's top sides have made approaches to Stromsgodset although Chelsea coach Jose Mourinho has ruled his side out of the race. Mourinho said: 'I have heard from him and he can go to 25 clubs. I want to know what club it is going to be, but we will not go into battle with all these clubs.'

"Ronald Koeman has revealed he wants to make Ryan Bertrand's loan deal at the club permanent. The 25-year-old is currently on his seventh loan spell from parent club Chelsea, but appears to have finally found his rhythm and has been impressing Southampton's manager. Bertrand was brought in as a replacement for Luke Shaw, who moved to Manchester United in the summer for £31.5million. But while Shaw has struggled to make an impact at his new club, Bertrand is playing arguably the best football of his career.

When asked whether he was interested in signing Bertrand on a permanent basis, Koeman told the Southern Daily Echo: 'If we have the money, yes. If its up to me, yes. 'Maybe it's too early to talk about that, but I am very happy until now with the performance of Ryan.' Bertrand won both the Champions League and Europa League with Chelsea, but his career stagnated in the years that followed. Now, Koeman believes regular football is helping him to develop once more. He said: 'Ryan got the opportunity (at Southampton) to play every weekend what he missed in Chelsea, he’s still a young player  and the best way to develop yourself is playing every weekend.'

"Pro-life campaigners are often criticised for harassing women seen going into abortion clinics. But the tables were turned  when a heavily pregnant lady hit back at anti-termination protesters demonstrating outside a London health centre  - leaving them lost for words. The verbal dressing-down came as a worker for Blackfriars Medical Practice, a GP surgery offering abortion services in Southwark, confronted Abort67 members and asked them to stop filming to protect patient confidentiality. A pregnant woman criticises anti-abortion group Abort67 outside Blackfriars Medical Practice in Southwark . Abort67 members denied specifically filming patients going into the surgery and claimed that they were using the cameras to provide evidence against those who accuse them of bullying tactics. A pregnant passer-by can then be seen approaching the group as they argue about the use of cameras, in footage uploaded toYouTube by journalist Sunny Hundal on Wednesday. She tells the protesters: 'You are wrong in what you're doing. 'You don't know why people are doing what they're doing, but you want to be out here judging and then filming.' When one of the female protesters tries to fight back by claiming that she had an abortion in the past,  the lady labels her a hypocrite. She said: 'You had an abortion but because you're not happy with what you're doing, you're standing out here making other people feel guilty. When you had an abortion, that was your choice. The pregnant woman tells the protesters that women should have choice . 'Many people have been abused, you don't know what their reasons are for, so I think this is so wrong on so many levels.' Referring to a recent incident in which a newborn baby was found dead in a wheelie bin in North Yorkshire, she adds: 'There was a baby on the news that got found in the bin. 'Maybe if their mum didn't feel that way because of people like you, that baby wouldn't have died. As the lady walks away, the protesters are left speechless by her words and are unable to argue back . 'You think it's better for them to get rid of it at ten weeks (in the womb) or to actually go through with the birth and then kill the child?' The unnamed woman goes on to tell the group they should have researched about the local area before protesting  as the clinic is near to Kids Company, a charity providing support to vulnerable inner-city children. Many of the children who go to the charity for help have been sexually abused or forced into sex work. The woman said: 'There's Kids Company round there, where we're helping thousands and thousands of kids while you're out here. 'You are in the wrong place, especially when we have our people that are going through their s*** , they're going to Kids Company where we're meant to help them, then they see this.' She adds: 'To be standing out here and making other people feel guilty is so wrong.' As the woman walks away, the protesters are left speechless and are unable to argue back. Since the footage was uploaded, hundreds of people have taken to Twitter to applaud the woman for her 'inspiring speech'. Thousands of pounds have also been given to the Kids Company 'Give a vulnerable child the gift of Christmas' campaign since the video was uploaded earlier today too. To donate to Kids Company the campaign, click here . The anti-abortion group Abort67 , which was started in 2008, has been confronting women going into the clinic with posters and leaflets showing pictures of  foetuses. A spokesman told MailOnline: 'The YouTube video by Sunny Hundal which reveals the gentle nature by which we hold our displays serves to emphasise that abortion is indefensible. 'Pro-aborts like Sunny can’t defend killing small human beings so he tries (in vain) to shame our volunteers for trying to defend the unborn child.' - Do you know the woman in the footage?

"19 Kids and Counting stars Jessa and Jill Duggar are reported to be in the midst of a bitter fight, after it was revealed that mother-to-be Jill, 23, had unfollowed her younger sister - and her new husband Ben Seewald - on Twitter. According to The Inquisitr, Jill, who is expecting her first child, a son, with husband Derick Dillard in March, is linked with all of her other Twitter-using family members, however Jessa and Ben's accounts are noticeably absent from her 16-strong follow list, which also includes Walmart and Fox News. It seems the resentment might not be mutual however; newly-wed Jessa follows both Jill and Derick, who is also listed as one of her followers. Scroll down for video . Squabbling sisters? Rumors have surfaced of a rift between the Duggar siblings after Jill (R) unfollowed Jessa (L) on Twitter . Happy families: Both sisters, pictured here with their parents Jim Bob and Michelle (center) and their respective partners, were married earlier this year . The reports will no doubt come as a shock to fans of the Duggar's hit reality series, who are used to seeing the siblings getting on incredibly well - particularly while helping each other to prepare for their respective wedding ceremonies, which both took place this year. While the reason behind the feud is not known, it is thought that the feud could have something to do with the girls' respective engagements and wedding ceremonies being so close together - and it has been speculated that Jessa felt her courtship with Ben was slightly overshadowed by the announcement of Jill's pregnancy. And it is not the first time that rumors of tension between Jessa and her siblings have surfaced. Earlier this year, eldest Duggar daughter Jana, 24, revealed in the family's tell-all biography Growing Up Duggar: It’s All About Relationships that she and Jessa regularly fought throughout much of their childhood. According to Jana, her parents Jim Bob and Michelle tried to end the sisters' constant fighting by making them share a bunk bed, which only resulted in Jessa continuing to torment her sibling by kicking her bunk every night and then laughing when she became upset. Twitter spat: Jessa's Twitter account is noticeably absent from her sister's 16-strong follow list . Wedded bliss: Jessa married Ben Seewald (pictured toghether, right) on November 1, while Jill and Derick (pictured together, left) wed in June . But while Jessa and and Jana seem to have repaired their relationship, it remains to be seen whether the same will be said of Jessa and Jill and their husbands, both of whom were welcomed into the family fold by patriarch Jim Bob earlier this year. In June, Jill married 25-year-old accountant Derick, sharing her first kiss with her new husband in front of 1,000 of their closest friends and family members during the ceremony, which was later broadcast in a special episode of 19 Kids and Counting. 'It was so cute - I thought Jill almost dove right into the moment,' the Duggar matriarch Michelle later said of the couple's first kiss. 'I was really surprised, but on the other hand, I'm not. I just think Jill is quite the enthusiastic person.' Interestingly, Jessa, who wed 19-year-old Ben on November 1, chose to wait until after the ceremony before enjoying her first kiss with her new husband so the couple could share the moment in private. 'They wanted their very first kiss ever to be in private,' Pastor Mike Schadt told People. 'It was important to the both of them.' Smiling sisters: The Duggar siblings are thought to be incredibly close . Big brood: Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar have 19 children and have admitted they would be open to having more in the future . When it came to preparing for their special days, mother Michelle revealed on her blog that both sisters received huge amounts of support from their siblings. 'Jill had so much help from her siblings to make the transition, helping her pack up her stuff at our house, moving and unpacking at her new home,' she wrote. 'They have their schedule already - they get up and off to work or Jill works on her studies.' In an earlier post, the mother-of-19 also discussed the difficulties involved in saying farewell to two of her children within such a short space of time. 'Change can be difficult for all of us, but it is such a good reason to have change. It's a joyful time,' she explained. '[Jim Bob] is so excited, too, for Derick and Jill, and for Ben and Jessa. 'When he talks about the girls getting married, he gets a little teary-eyed; it's a big deal for a dad to let go of his girls. He's handing them over, but he's handing them over to some really great guys.'","Both sisters married their respective partners earlier this year .

"Premier League target Sami Khedira says he is 'curious' to see where he will be playing next season as uncertainty continues to surround the Real Madrid midfielder's future. The World Cup winner's contract expires at the end of the season while a host of European clubs including Chelsea, Arsenal and Bayern Munich have been linked with his signature. However, the Germany international insisted that no clubs have been in contact with him and even hinted that he could sign a contract extension at the Bernabeu - despite having to compete with the likes of Luka Modric, Toni Kroos and Asier Illarramendi for a place.

There are no talks with other clubs. I am curious myself to see where I will end up.'

"When 24-year-old Alex Hopwood received a terminal cancer diagnosis two months ago, she was determined not to let it stop her enjoying her life. In fact, the childcare worker from Hinckley, Leicestershire, created a glamorous bucket list fit for an A-Lister and has been working her way through it ever since. Alex has travelled to three continents and seen some of the world's most famous sites, in a bid to make some treasured memories with her beloved friends and family. Jetsetter Alex Hopwood, pictured before she was diagnosed with terminal cancer . Alex, pictured in hospital with her mother, left, was first diagnosed with cancer in September 2013 . Since her diagnosis Alex has travelled to Dubai with her Mum (left) and taken a trip to Las Vegas (right) And despite her hectic schedule, Alex, who was diagnosed with leukemia in 2013, has even found the time to set up a charity to help others in her position. As well as having tea at the Ritz in London and visiting Disneyland Paris, Alex has also watched Britney Spears perform in Las Vegas - flying out with her friends and family. She has visited Dubai, Iceland, and rented out a cottage with her friends, had a pretend Christmas Day, and visited country houses around her home county of Leicestershire. Alex said: 'As soon as I was told the news that there was no more treatment available to me, I came home and a friend encouraged me to write a list of things I wanted to do. 'All the trips and days out that I was hoping to do once I'd got better, I decided to do them now. I've flown over the Grand Canyon in a helicopter, and watched the Northern Lights in Iceland. Alex and her friends took a helicopter ride in Las Vegas as part of her bucket list . Alex's brother Dane donated bone marrow to his sister twice but Alex's cancer came back . 'I've had tea at the Ritz and taken my little niece to Disneyland - it's all been incredible. 'I'm lucky enough to have some amazing friends and family, so I just want to spend as much time with them as possible. I'm just so grateful for every single day.' Alex was first diagnosed with the disease after noticing unusual bruises appearing on her body in September 2013. After a bone marrow transplant from her brother, Dane, she was told she was in remission just four months later. She said: 'When I was told the cancer was gone, it was such a relief. My brother had been amazing to donate his bone marrow and I was so excited to get back on with my life. But she was given the devastating news when a routine scan earlier this year revealed the cancer was back. Alex said: 'I was going for routine scans and everything was positive until about May when the scans had come back. Alex (second from the left, top) and her friends enjoyed a silent disco at a cottage in the Cotswolds . Alex (left) has used her spare time to set up a charity to help other people in her position . 'It was such a shock but I just threw myself back into chemo again - I had every treatment possible and my brother donated his bone marrow again. 'Once again we thought everything was going well, and I had to wait 100 days until after the transplant to have a biopsy to check it had worked. 'I was hoping for the best, but in the middle of October this year the doctors explained that it hadn't worked, and there was nothing more that they could do. Alex was then faced with having to tell her friends and family that she didn't have long left to live. 'I had sort of prepared myself for bad news, but it was just devastating - I hated that I was going to have to tell all the people I loved the bad news - I didn't want to upset them,' she said. Alex having a glass of Champagne with her pals in Las Vegas as part of her A-list bucket list . After returning home from hospital, a friend suggested Alex write a list of things she wanted to do. Alex said: 'It wasn't a set list of things I definitely had to tick off, but more a list of wishes. 'It included big things like Vegas, Dubai and Iceland, but also smaller things like staying in the Cotswolds with my friends and going on days out with my family. 'As soon as I'd done it, I messaged my friends asking if they wanted to come to Vegas - I couldn't believe it when so many people replied saying they wanted to come with me. 'Thirty-one of us - including my mum, Jacky, flew out all together and it was just incredible. 'We flew over the Grand Canyon in a helicopter, watched Britney Spears perform, visited the famous Vegas sign, and sped around the city in a limo. Alex, centre, pictured outside The Ritz in London where she went for tea with her friend and mum, right . 'It was one of the best experiences of my life.' She added: 'A lot of people can't get over the news that they are very ill, but I just thought that there was no point in dwelling on it. I didn't want this cancer to stop me from doing anything. 'I know I'm lucky to have so many amazing people in my life, so I just want to spend lots of time with them.' However, it is not always easy going: 'I do feel more poorly now since I first went away, but I just want to keep going for as long as possible.' Alex has also set up a charity to support other young people in her position. All wrapped up in Iceland in front of a glacier, Alex has made sure to snap pictures as she enjoys her travels . Alex said it was important to involve her family in her journey, including on this trip to Disneyland Paris . She said: 'I set up a charity throughout my ongoing battle as it gave me a lift helping others - I was inspired to create something positive out of something so negative. 'It gave me a purpose in life when I was going through treatment. It was really important to me to raise awareness and reach out to other people, so I created a charity called A Gift To Lift. 'It's a charity to create memorable experiences for blood cancer patients, and I aim to raise enough funds to have a special holiday lodge for patients and their families to spend quality time at. 'I gave my first experience to a girl who was treated in the same hospital as me and it was just incredible. 'I also make accessories for the charity to raise funds. I've organised a fundraising night where we raised over £8,000.' Alex and her pals looked glamorous at a themed night for her A Gift To Lift charity where she raised £8000 . Before she was diagnosed with cancer Alex had long hair (left), now she wears a similar-coloured wig (right) And despite her terminal prognosis, Alex continues to live every day to its fullest. She said: 'I never asked how much time I have left as I don't want to know, but more recently some of the doctors and nurses have been talking to me about arranging somewhere I'd want to be when I might pass away. 'Whatever happens now, I know I've experienced some of the most incredible things, and I'll always be grateful for that. 'It's my friends and family, especially my mum, that have kept me going and supported me. Life is for living - I'm determined to keep smiling, and appreciate every single day.'

"A married software executive dramatically changed his plea to guilty in a Houston court on Wednesday and admitted drugging and sexually assaulting one of his female employees. In doing so, Henri Morris, 67, spared as many as half a dozen women having to testify that he would take them on business trips, spike their drinks, abuse them and take naked pictures of them. Shaking as he admitted his guilt, Morris now faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine and will have to register for the rest of his life as a sex offender. In exchange for changing his plea, prosecutors agreed to drop the other sexual abuse charges against him and thereby spare his accusers of being cross examined in the witness box. Guilty: Sixty-seven-year-old Henri Morris admitted to one count of taking a person across state lines to commit a sex crime on Wednesday. The former head of Edible Software faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. He will have to register as a sex offender . US District Judge Melinda Harmon told Morris that she would have him back in her courtroom in February for sentencing and reminded him he tried to cut a deal last year that would have seen him serve only one year in prison. 'The truth comes out,' said one of the women to the Houston Chronicle. 'He got away with it for a long time and now everybody knows who he truly is.' Morris, who was the president of Edible Software Solutions was characterized as a 'calculated and choreographed' sexual predator who would take female employees on business trips and use his 'rape kit' to drug them. Prosecutor Sherri Zack said that one of his victims approached the FBI in 2012 that she believed Morris had drugged and abused her while away for work. Company: Prosecutors say Morris was a calculating sexual predator who brought rape drugs on business trips to use on employees. They say he physically abused and photographed them . She said they had gone for a drink and then she woke up, nude and confused under a hotel room desk to see Morris taking pictures of her. Officers began an investigation and discovered other women at Edible Software had similar stories. So, in 2012, the victim who first approached the FBI worked with them to set up Morris for an arrest at Bush Continental Airport. When he was taken into custody, agents discovered a 'rape kit' in his possession which contained date rape drugs and Viagra. Morris' defense team had previously tried to argue that the women willingly drank to excess with their client but that no abuse had ever occurred. The former executive admitted adultery but until Wednesday refuted any claims he was a date rapist.","Henri Morris changed his plea to guilty at the last minute in Houston .

"Just about recovered from the Ice Bucket Challenge? Prepare yourself to take on the latest charity challenge that's sweeping social media. The After Eight challenge sees participants attempt to slide a chocolate down their face and into their mouth without the use of their hands in the quickest time possible. They are then encouraged to donate money to charity and nominate three more people to try to beat their time. The concept is the brainchild of Liverpool legend, Kenny Dalglish, who has been using his connections in the sporting world to get stars to undertake the charity challenge. Scroll down for video . Jack Whitehall, left, and Jamie Redknapp, right, have both taken part in the After Eight Challenge . He is asking participants to donate money to the Marina Dalglish appeal - a cause he set up in his wife's honour after she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2003. As of Thursday, ex-Westlife singer Nicky Byrne has smashed the record after he managed to get the chocolate from his forehead into his mouth in just 2.88 seconds. Kenny himself held the crown until Monday, with a time of 5.44 seconds, but was also beaten by Coleen Rooney and Jamie Redknapp with 3.0 seconds and 3.5 seconds respectively. Footballing heroes Matt le Tissier, Alan Hansen and Ian Ayre (CEO of LFC) are also showing their support to Kenny and Marina by participating and donating to the appeal. And it looks set to spread even further afield after footballers Adam Lallana, Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and Brendan Rogers were nominated. David Beckham has even been nominated by his ex-England teammate from the 90s, Matt Le Tissier. A blurred Coleen Rooney, left, and Matt Le Tissier, who nominated David Beckham, also tried the challenge . Are these two next? David Beckham has been nominated - so will he take part and nominate his wife Victoria? Speaking about the appeal, Kenny said: 'It's fantastic to see the support from all these stars spreading. Nicky Byrne has done a great job of stealing the current challenge crown. 'The challenge is really fun and the appeal is so important for helping women affected by breast cancer. Don't forget to donate when you take part.' Marina Dalglish added: 'It is fantastic to see people are getting behind the charity and having such a lot of fun doing it. But we mustn't forget the real reason for this challenge, to raise money for those affected by breast cancer. The contribution is incredibly important to those affected, so please donate generously.' The couple, whose services to charity have been recognised with many awards, have raised £1.5m for a Chemotherapy Centre at Aintree and Fazekerley Hospital, £3.1m towards a Radiotherapy Centre at Aintree and £500,000 towards a new Chemotherapy Centre at Southport and Formby Hospital.

Soarigami is a clip-on, origami-style armrest divider that looks like a paper airplane and frees up twice the space of a regular armrest. The invention also folds easily back into your bag, not taking up valuable space in your cabin luggage allowance. However, the solution to an everyday problem is not quite there yet - it is still being tested and is not expected to be released until early 2015. How the Soarigami will be modelled; the paper divider is set to be available early 2015 . Grace Chang writes on the Soarigami blog: 'Soarigami was designed to elevate the travel space by getting rid of the fight for armrests. 'Sick of fighting for armrests, our co-founder sketched the first idea onto a cocktail napkin during a particularly unpleasant flight. 'Sora means sky in Japanese, and gami means graceful. With the product being origami-inspired and meant to be used in flight, the name Soarigami was born, aiming to soar the skies with grace. 'The Sorigami is a portable, lightweight travel product that ends the fight for elbows.' The divider is expected to retail at around £20 ($30).","Soarigami is a clip-on, origami-style divider that looks like a paper airplane .

"There aren't many marriage proposals that can be seen from space, but for this traveller, an epic journey through Japan was also a unique marriage proposal. Japanese artist Yasushi Takahashi – a.k.a Yassan - left his job to travel through Japan, covering more than 4,349 miles (7,000 kilometres) in six months, mostly on foot and sometimes by car, ferry or bicycle. GPS technology tracked his every step as he journeyed from Hokkaido island to Hyodo Cliff on Kyushu island where the trek ended. The final stage of Yassan's romantic journey included an arrow struck heart after the giant proposal . At the end of his journey, the GPS records of his travels around the country spelled out the phrase ‘Marry Me’ - with an arrow through the heart sign added afterwards for good measure. Each location was carefully planned so that the GPS tracking would spell out his romantic chosen phrase clearly. 'I wanted to write the world's biggest proposal, and I found GPS drawing was the way to do it,' Yassan said of his feat. Yasushi Takahashi also made a video of his entire trek to show his girlfriend afterwards. At the start of his record breaking journey he straps on his GPS tracking equipment, above . Seen from above, the GPS tracking leaves a trail wherever Yassa walks . Yassan quit his job to go on the trek of his home country, visiting locations the length and breadth of Japan . The heartwarming expedition has been chosen to appear in a new documentary about how walking can lead to extraordinary things. The 'Walkumentary Series' is an online project produced by Amsterdam-based agency this that + the other for the brand Hi-Tec, which aims to show how inspiring walking can be. Yassan, then 31, quit his job in 2008 and planned a journey through Japan, taking with him a GPS device and a map. He documents many steps of his epic journey with a video capturing some of his favourite moments . Some of his journey was taken by car but in this episode he films the aftermath of leaving the road (unhurt) Give me an 'M': Yassan starts the first letter of his carefully planned proposal . GPS stands for Global Positioning System, and is a worldwide radio-navigation system which automatically sends information to a central tracking portal. It is used in a range of situations to monitor the location of things and people in real-time, using the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) network. Microwave signals are transmitted to GPS devices to give information on location, speed of travel, time and direction. A GPS tracking system can give real-time and historic navigation data on any kind of journey. His purpose was two-fold: to experience Japan fully, and also to draw a special message for his girlfriend using GPS tracking technology. As a part of his unique marriage proposal, Yassan also created a seven-minute video describing his epic journey through the country. The video is split into seven 'chapters' and shows various stages of his trek, starting at Hokkaido island. Video footage of his experiences include him walking along on dificult roads, climbing Mount Fuji and visiting hot springs. Yassan’s legwork is officially the world’s largest marriage proposal, and also holds the Guinness Record for the world’s biggest GPS drawing, covering 7,164 kilometers. Yasushi Takahashi split his video into seven 'chapters' documenting his journey . Yassan journeyed from Hokkaido island to Hyodo Cliff on Kyushu island where his trek ended . Not only a record breaking trek but a particularly romantic use of GPS . All lit up at night, the giant proposal is the only one in the world which can be seen from space . And was it a happy ending? Luckily, yes, despite the fact that it took six months. 'It wasn't a waste of time. After I explained, she said yes. It is a sweet memory,' says Yassan at the end of the documentary.","Japanese artist Yasushi Takahashi quit his job to make the trek .

"House Republicans took a symbolic vote today to impede President Barack Obama from using executive actions to 'exempt' categories of illegal immigrants from deportation. The House voted 219-197 to approve the legislation authored by Florida Rep. Ted Yoho. At a press conference before the vote, House Speaker John Boehner said the lower chamber would pass the bill to make it clear to Obama it was 'rejecting his unilateral actions.' While it's success was assured in the GOP-run chamber, it has no chance of seeing daylight in the Democratically-controlled Senate. House GOP leadership offered the vote as a consolation prize to their right-wing counterparts in Congress who want to use a critical spending bill as a cudgel against the Democratic president. Scroll down for video . 'This course of action is based on numerous conversations with our members,' House Speaker John Boehner said today of the GOP's current strategy to take on the president while funding the government, adding that he too thinks it's the best plan . As soon as the votes were tallied this afternoon Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said, as predicted, that he would not take up the House's bill to restrict Obama's actions. 'Unfortunately for anyone who wants to see Congress fix our broken immigration system, the Republican approach is being dictated by the most extreme voices in their party,' Reid said in a statement. 'Republicans’ knee-jerk resistance to working with Democrats to fix this problem left the President with no option but to take action to protect families from being separated.' Reid encouraged Republicans to 'put aside their partisan political games' and instead 'focus their efforts on passing a permanent, common-sense solution to fix our broken immigration.' With just four work days left until Congress lets out until early January, and a Dec. 11 deadline to extend  government funding or shut its doors, comprehensive immigration reform is nowhere near the top of Republicans' year-end to-do list. Fearing a government shutdown just as the current legislative session comes to a close ahead of the holidays, establishment Republicans are asking conservatives to wait until after the party takes control of the Senate next year to brawl with the president. Instead, they plan to proceed with a continuing resolution to fund the entire government except the Department of Homeland Security through the end of the current fiscal year. The immigration management agency would only be funded through the first quarter of 2015. At that time, Republicans would have the opportunity to push through an appropriations bill with more teeth. On Capitol Hill the legislation is creatively being referred to as the CRomnibus - a combination of CR, the shortened version of continuing resolution, and omnibus, a term to describe an overarching spending bill. Boehner said today that the the spending bill would allow the GOP to keep the government open while 'keeping our leverage' so that when they get 'reinforcements' in the Senate in January they can take on Obama. 'This course of action was based on numerous conversations with our members, and I frankly think it gives us the best chance for success,' Boehner told reporters. 'We think this is the most practical way to fight the president's action,' he said minutes later, noting again that leadership had extensive talks with members of it's caucus before going down this path. 'We listened to some members who were frankly griping the most,' he said. 'This was their idea of how to proceed.' But conservatives in Congress have vocally argued that by March of next year, when funding for DHS would run out under the current plan, the president will have already begun to issue work permits and green cards to as many as 5 million immigrants. Therefore, prohibitive legislation must be passed as soon as possible, they say, preferably just after the new Congress convenes in January. 'The president is already printing work permits as we speak. Why do we want to give him another 2-3 months? We could vote on this the day we get back,' Louisiana Rep. John Fleming told Breitbart news earlier this week. Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, the ranking member on the Senate Budget committee, exploded on House leadership on Tuesday evening in a statement, arguing that they were reneging on Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus' promise that the party would do 'everything we can' to stop Obama's directives from taking effect. 'Unfortunately, the plan now being circulated in the House fails to meet that test,' Sessions said. 'The executive amnesty language is substantially weaker than the language the House adopted this summer, and does not reject the central tenets of the President’s plan: work permits, Social Security, and Medicare to 5 million illegal immigrants—reducing wages, jobs, and benefits for Americans,' he added. Sessions claimed that Obama is demanding that 'Congress fund his imperial decree and declare its own irrelevance.' 'That is why Congress must respond to the President’s unlawful action by funding the government but not funding illegal amnesty,' he said. 'Such a plan would put the focus where it belongs: on Senate Democrats. They are the ones who should be made to choose sides—save Obama’s amnesty or save Americans’ jobs and borders.' In a statement sent out the same night Louisiana Sen. David Vitter blasted his colleagues in the House for caving to Reid before they even took a vote on conservatives' preferred legislation. 'Make no mistake, sending a bill to the Senate without first making an attempt to include defund language is telling the American people that you support Obama’s executive amnesty,' he said. 'That would be a slap in the face to the voters who sent a message last month by electing Republican majorities in Congress.' Retiring Congresswoman Michele Bachmann of Minnesota made a similar point on Wednesday during a press conference with Iowa Rep. Steve King and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. 'Will we be a people who decide that we are going to go with the freight train of what Washington, D.C., wants or will we listen and harken to the voice of the American people that was stated unmistakingly on Nov. 4?'  Bachmann said, according to the National Journal. Cruz told Republicans who ran on their opposition to unilateral immigration in their recent campaigns 'do what you said you would do.' 'Doing what you promise doesn't mean, as it so often does in Washington, sending a really stern letter and having a meaningless show vote. Why do you think people are so frustrated with Washington? Because they recognize there are a whole lot of politicians who say one thing at home and do something different here,' Cruz said. Senator Ted Cruz  speaks to the press about the need 'To Defund the President's Executive, Unconstitutional Amnesty' on Capitol Hill in Washington on Wednesday with Reps. Steve King, left, and Michele Bachmann, right. Cruz told Republicans who ran for reelection on their opposition to unilateral immigration in their recent campaigns 'do what you said you would do' The probable 2016 presidential candidate warned that 'the same folks who are saying, ""Gosh, we cannot do anything now,"" are the same folks who in January are going to say, ""Gosh, we don't have 60 votes in the Senate."" ' 'It's like Charlie Brown and Lucy where consistently the same voices pull the football aside and say, ""You know what, you can never ever ever do anything to stop a lawless president,"" ' he contended. Even after Republicans ascend to the majority in the Senate, they will still be at least six votes shy of being able to overcome a Democratic filibuster on prized legislation, unless incoming Majority Leader Mitch McConnell decides to adopt the so-called 'nuclear option' of governing that allows bills to advance with a simple majority of votes. When Reid introduced the nuclear option, McConnell and other Republican legislators railed against it. But now that it's their turn in the driver's seat, they're considering making it part of their lawmaking practices, as well. In the meantime, conservative hardliners are hoping they can still convince their caucus to vote down the plan currently under consideration by the House, paving the way for one that funds DHS for a shorter time period to come to the floor. 'I’m probably leaning no [on the current House plan],' North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows told Politico on Tuesday night. 'I think in terms of the CR omnibus, without a limitation language, there are not enough votes. I’m not on the whip team but listening to a number of my colleagues, there is more than enough concern.' If the short-term legislation funding Homeland Security through March does pass in the House, Reid has committed to bringing it for a vote in the upper chamber, calling the potential deal a 'big accomplishment' on Tuesday. 'The American people certainly will not want to face another year being governed by crisis,' Reid said. 'No one wants the kind of cliffhanger fights we’ve had again and again in recent years.' Boehner told reporters today, 'I expect that we'll have bipartisan support to pass the omnimbus spending bill.' Yoho said this week he was satisfied, for now, that his own legislation to reign in the president's authority would be given its day in the House. 'My hat's off to the leadership,' Yoho, an ally of conservative lawmakers, told the National Journal. 'I commend leadership for saying, 'You know what, this sounds like a commonsense bill.'","Legislation impedes President Barack Obama from using executive actions to 'exempt' categories of illegal immigrants from deportation .

"Scientists have developed a male birth control pill which they claim is 99 per cent effective and has few side effects. The pill, derived from an Indonesian shrub, apparently allows men to produce sperm that cannot get women pregnant. It is made from the gendarussa plant, which has long been used by tribesmen on the island of Papua to prevent their wives from conceiving. Scientists have developed a pill, derived from an Indonesian shrub, which they claim will render sperm incapable of getting a woman pregnant - with a 99 per cent efficacy rate . Professor Bambang Prajogo, of Airlangga University, developed the pill after hearing rumours of these effects, and bringing the gendarussa plant to his lab for study in 1985. He has carried out 30 years of research, isolating the active ingredient, putting it into a tablet form, and carrying out clinical trials to prove its contraceptive effects, Global Post reports. He says the plant’s active ingredient disrupts three key enzymes in sperm, weakening them and making them unable to penetrate the eggs during the fertilization process. This would not interfere with the quantity or quality of sperm produced because it only targets the enzymes, he told the Jakarta Post. Professor Prajogo is currently working on the dosage, but hopes to create a formula meaning men would take the pill an hour before sex. Small clinical trials, the largest studying 350 men, found it to be 99 per cent effective. They also found male fertility returned to normal within a month of taking the pill. However some men gained weight on the pill, Professor Prajogo told the Global Post. The gendarussa plant, is a small branched shrub found in China, Malaysia, India, the Phillipines and Indonesia. In 1985, Indonesian researchers began to look into its effect as a contraceptive. They heard anecdotal evidence that men belonging to a certain tribe in Papua were using it as a contraceptive, Coconuts Jakarta reports. The tribesmen would boil the leaves in water and then drink the water 30 minutes before having sex. It is said to have been a 'godsend' for the tribesmen. In their culture, they were not allowed to get their wives pregnant until after they had fully paid off their dowries. Professor Prajogo, of Airlangga University, has been studying the contraceptive effects of gendarussa for nearly three decades. He says the plant’s active ingredient disrupts three key enzymes in sperm, making them unable to penetrate the eggs during the fertilization process. And at least one participant saw an increase in two enzymes that indicate poor heart or liver functioning, although it was unclear whether this was due to the pill or another health issue, he said. But overall, researchers found no obvious side effects, and 'certainly none that rival those associated with female hormone-based contraceptive pills'. Hormonal birth control has been linked with a raised risk of heart attack, strokes and blood clots, as well as nausea and bleeding. However previous research has found one of the biggest barriers to a male birth control pill comes from the attitudes of women – who don’t trust their partners with the responsibility of taking it. In 2011, a survey by Anglia Ruskin University found that half of women would not rely on a male pill as contraception – because they did not trust their partners to remember to take it. Now, the Indonesian medicines regulatory body wants a bigger trial to verify the findings. Indeed, such a trial would need to be carried out for the pill to be marketed in Europe or the U.S. But global pharmaceutical companies are already showing an interest in the pill. Professor Bambang said he has already turned down an offer of billions of funding from a major U.S. pharmaceutical firm, who wanted to buy his patent, which is owned by the University. Now, he says the pill will hit the shelves by 2016, although regulations mean it may take up to a decade longer to be sold in Europe and the U.S. The news comes after the Parsemus Foundation, a not-for-profit organisation based in the U.S., announced its trials of a new birth control injection were proving promising. The injection, called Vasalgel, is injected into the vas deferens - the tube that sperm passes through on the way to the penis. The gel acts to block sperm, thus preventing pregnancy. Developers hope it will be cheap, reversible and long-lasting, and hope to make it available within three years. Similarly, last year Australian researchers said they had made a scientific breakthrough that could make a male contraceptive pill reality. Their technique worked like a temporary vasectomy, stopping sperm leaving the body during sex. This works by blocking two proteins involved in the ejaculation process. The pill works by weakening enzymes in sperm, making them unable to penetrate the eggs during the fertilization process .","Pill said to weakens enzymes in sperm so a woman can't become pregnant .

"Whether it's being used as a swanky party venue, floating showroom or private vessel, the Xhibitionist is certainly a boat designed to turn heads. The 75 metre long vessel is an extravagant, multipurpose yacht which even comes with its own supercar. Designed by Swedish-based car designer Eduard Gray, the slick ship's interior is decked out in Art Nouveau decor, with classic touches like a Steinway piano, a dual staircase, and fine crystal Baccarat lighting. But you'll need Bruce Wayne's bank account if you want to buy one. The lead-in price is 2 million euros (£16million) for a 'basic' model. Keeping with its automotive theme, the Xhibitionist has space for a car showroom and 'engine room', complete with exposed engines displayed behind glass walls. Solar panels fold out from under a sleek car-hood-like deck to power the ship, and the panels double up as a concert space or helipad with space for three helicopters. The fly deck even features a Jacuzzi, and by night, the superyacht glows in the dark thanks to oceanLED lighting. As for the Xhibitionist's price?

"Not content with backflips or somersaults, this experienced slackliner strips off in mid-air. While balancing on a rope with no safety net - and often no harness, Jaan Roose, from Estonia, rips off his shirt and pulls down his trousers to reveal his chiselled physique and underwear. Roose, 22, has been a slackliner for four years, and travels the world capturing his daredevil stunts in photographs and videos. The sport requires intense concentration to remain balanced on an unstable line that is anchored between two points. Most participants attempt to cross the line without losing their balance, but Jaan likes to take things a step further. The thrillseerker hurls himself into the air, twists and turns, and lands back on the rope - and even he jumps from one slackline to the other. But his most impressive trick is surely the strip act he performs in which he kicks off his trainers, whips off his shirt and pulls his trousers down. Jaan said: 'My first clothes off trick was in 2011, when I did it for the videos and then in competition. The trick was taking my shirt off. 'Years later I came back to this idea with the question, 'What other tricks can I do with clothes?' 'I had the idea for a long time to take clothes off while slacklining because nobody was doing it this way. And I was bored creating just high-level crazy tricks, most slackliners go this way, they try to make the craziest stuff. 'I wanted to keep doing crazy stunts, but not as dangerous or typical. I wanted to be more creative. 'People's reaction to this video was wonderful. The slackline community liked it as it was something new and fresh. People were saying.

"A man committed suicide in West Dallas on Wednesday by decapitating himself in front of horrified motorists. Hugo Rodriguez, 35, tied a rope to a fire hydrant before wrapping the other end around his neck in Texas, before accelerating. Before the horrific act, the man scribbled a message on the side of the vehicle. The first two words appear to say 'no code' while the second part 'Codbo' could be a reference to the video game Call of Duty: Black Ops. Scroll down for video . Horrific: A man killed himself in West Dallas by decapitating himself in his van. Before the horrific act he wrote a message believed to be in Spanish on the side of the vehicle . Witnesses described how he then got into his van and pressed on the throttle. His body was thrown out of the vehicle and was seen lying on the street by stunned drivers. According to CBS DFW the van eventually came to a stop without running into any cars or pedestrians. Witnesses described on social media how the body was still in the road hours later as police cleaned up the scene. The message the man wrote on the side of his van could be related to computer game Call of Duty Black Ops . The van was eventually taken away while a cordon of patrol cars surrounded Mr Rodriguez's body. Police are now investigating the incident but revealed that no one else was hurt. In the aftermath, shocked witnesses posted images online purportedly showing the victim still on the road. Call of Duty Black Ops is a version of the computer game franchise that releases a new edition almost every year. It is a first-person shooter that was developed in 2010 and is set in the Second World War and the Cold War. Gamers are armed with machine guns, rifles, pistols and grenades and play a fast-paced game of kill or be killed. Last year, a coroner in Britain stated that four teenage suicides were partly to blame on versions of the game. A spokesman for the Dallas Police Department told Mail Online: 'Witnesses observed the victim, Hugo Rodriguez a Latin male  tie a rope around a fire hydrant and then around his neck. 'He got into his van and accelerated, causing the rope to tighten around his neck and decapitated himself. A suicide offense was documented.'

"Burnley boss Sean Dyche will not risk the club's future by embarking on a lavish spending spree in January despite their lowly position. The Clarets are bottom of the Premier League with four points from 10 games and still without a win this season, with their last match a 3-0 defeat at Arsenal. Dyche said splashing out £30million on new signings in the transfer window would 'probably ruin the club' because of the pressure that would put on the wage bill, and insists he is unconcerned by the spectre of unwanted records, not least the 11 points Derby only managed to secure in the entire 2007-8 season.

Dyche said Arsene Wenger had a wry smile on his face when he learned Burnley's wage bill . The Burnley manager said: 'I spent half-an-hour with Arsene Wenger and Steve Bould after the match last week and he had a wry smile when I told him our wage bill compared to his own. 'If we had £30million to spend it would probably ruin the club because you have to find the wages to support that level of signings. In my view I am not only a manager but I am also a custodian of a club that has been here since 1882. 'Players at the top end of the Championship are now earning unbelievable money and as soon as you go into the Premier League clubs are asking astronomical fees - you are not talking about adding a million or two but an extra £10million.' Alexis Sanchez scored twice when Burnley were beaten 3-0 by Arsenal on Saturday . Burnley's most recent accounts showed their 2012-13 wage bill was £15.4million, by far the lowest in the top flight. Arsenal's most recent accounts show their wage bill is more than 10 times that figure, £166.4million while top payers Manchester City's was £233.1million. Burnley's next attempt to find that elusive win comes on Saturday when Hull visit Turf Moor and Dyche said Tigers boss Steve Bruce had told him it is becoming ever more difficult for Championship clubs to bridge the gap in the top flight. The three promoted clubs are currently propping up the bottom of the table. Sanchez celebrates his second and Arsenal's third goal in the 90th minute as Gunners ran out easy winners . Dyche added: 'Many managers I've spoken to including Steve Bruce believe it's getting harder for teams promoted from the Championship. They tell me the gap is getting wider and look at what even teams like Hull have spent recently.' Burnley do at least have one positive piece of injury news with Steven Reid is expected to be fit for Saturday.","Burnley are currently bottom of the Premier League with just four points .

"A kindhearted waiter who found a wallet with $4,000 inside has been commended for chasing down its owner to hand it back. Wilber Palicios was working at Hom Restaurant in Bayshore, Wisconsin on Friday night when he was clearing away a table and found the bulging wallet hidden beneath napkins. By then, its owner had already left the restaurant - but Palicios didn't hesitate. He ran out from the restaurant and saw the man climbing into his car across the parking lot. Scroll down for video . Doing the right thing: Wilber Palicios, pictured, discovered the wallet while working a shift on Friday and raced outside to give it back to its rightful owner - despite the $4,000 inside . 'I saw him way over there, so I ran over there, and he was getting into his car,' the man, who is originally from Mexico, told WISN. 'I just waved at him, just show him the wallet.' The relieved customer, who has asked not to be identified, gave the waiter an undisclosed amount as a 'thank you'. 'I just thought it was the right thing to do,' Palicios said. For his honesty, his employers have also given him $250. 'And we've bought him dinner just about every night since he did it, too,' Omar Shaikh, president of Surg Restaurant Group, which owns Hom, told WISN. Scene: Palicios' bosses at Hom gave him a $250 bonus that he said he would send to his mother in Mexico . When the channel asked Palicios what the extra cash meant to him, he became emotional and struggled to speak. 'Well, I really appreciate it, so I can send it to my mom for Christmas,' he said, explaining that she and his sisters live back in Mexico. 'She really needs it.' Customers also passed on their praise to Palicios for his noble decision. 'Wilber's mother should be very proud of him and HOM Restaurant is very lucky to have such an honest employee,' one wrote on Facebook.

"A quick thinking bus driver proved a real hero on Wednesday when her vehicle caught fire and she managed to get all 38 middle school students on board to safety before the bus became engulfed in flames. Kristina Behrman, 31, was driving her bus along Interstate 4 in Polk County, Florida, at about 7:25 a.m. when it began to experience mechanical problems and smoke started emitting from the back. Remaining calm under pressure, Behrman - who is a math teacher and substitute bus driver - pulled her vehicle over to the shoulder of the interstate and quickly mobilized her students to exit the bus in a quick and orderly fashion.

Behrman was driving her vehicle along Interstate 4 in Polk County, Florida, at about 7:25am on Wednesday when it began to experience mechanical problems and smoke started emitting from the back . ‘I was driving down the interstate and all of a sudden my bus started smoking and now my bus is in flames,’ she told emergency services after calling 911. On the same call she can also be heard giving her students strict instructions to ensure everyone’s safety. Behrman  pulled over just in time as the entire vehicle then caught fire. ‘There were still three kids on the bus when flames started coming,’ she told WTSP. One driver passing the scene managed to capture footage of the fire on a cell phone. The video shows the flames shooting into the sky and barrels of smoke filling the air. The heavy smoke was so bad it forced Florida Highway Patrol to close the highway in both directions causing traffic back-ups for hours.

"Chinese hackers stole classified information from Malaysian officials involved in the search for MH370 a day after the plane disappeared, it was claimed today. Government departments were sent e-mails containing a virus disguised as a hoax news report saying the Malaysian Airlines jet had been found. When the attachment was opened, the virus - known as malware - began extracting sensitive data and sending it to a computer in China. The attack came at a time when Malaysian . officials in charge of the search were being heavily criticised - . particularly by the Chinese - for not releasing crucial information. Scroll down for video . 'Targeted': Chinese hackers have been accused of stealing classified information from Malaysian officials involved in the search for missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 a day after it disappeared on March 8 . Were these men hacked? Malaysian Airlines chief Ahmad Jauhari Yahya (second l) and Department of Civil Aviation boss Datuk Azharuddin Abdul Rahman (second r) address the media after MH370 disappeared . It was spotted by CyberSecurity Malaysia – a Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation agency - which blocked the transmissions and shut down the infected machines. But by then around 30 computers in the Department of Civil Aviation, the National Security Council and Malaysia Airlines had been infected and an unknown amount of information stolen, a source said. CyberSecurity Malaysia chief executive Dr Amirudin Abdul Wahab told Nicholas Cheng from the Malaysia Star: 'We received reports from the administrators of the agencies telling us that their network was congested with e-mail going out of their servers. 'Those e-mails contained confidential data from the officials' computers, including the minutes of meetings and classified documents. Some of these were related to the MH370 investigation. 'This was well-crafted malware that anti-virus programs couldn't detect. It was a very sophisticated attack.' Desperate for information: Malaysia Airlines commercial director Hugh Dunleavy (centre) speaks to journalists in China. The cyber attack came at a time when officials were criticised for their handling of the search . The breach was traced to an IP address - a unique number assigned to each computer on a network - in China, but no further details have been given. Interpol are reportedly working with the agencies with the investigation. Flight MH370 vanished inexplicably en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, and there has been no sign since of the aircraft or the 239 people onboard. Reports of the hack come as Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said A new underwater hunt for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 had a 'reasonable chance' of finding the plane. It is believed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean far off the west coast of Australia, but a massive air and sea search failed to find any wreckage while an underwater probe gave no answers. Experts have now used technical data to finalise the most likely resting place of the plane deep on the ocean seabed and are preparing for a more intense underwater search to find it. 'They are now going to search the entire probable impact zone which is, from memory, something like 60,000 square kilometres (23,000 square miles) of the ocean floor, off the coast of Western Australia,' Abbott told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. 'If the plane is down there - and the best expert advice is that it did go into the water somewhere in this arc off the coast of Western Australia - if the plane is down there, there is a reasonable chance that we'll find it because we are using the best possible technology.'","Emails sent to government departments involved in hunt for missing jet .

The mum and her herd came to the rescue of her baby - using only their trunks to fish him out. The photos were taken in Addo National Park near Port Elizabeth, in South Africa, where around 600 elephants call home. Adorable photos of an elephant and her herd scooping a baby calf out of the water have emerged . In Addo National Park in South Africa, a sweet baby calf tumbled into a pool of water . Amateur photographer Adele van Schalkwyk, who works as a technologist at a private pathology laboratory in Vredenburg, South Africa, said she could sense the emotion from the herd as she took the photos. She said: 'When I took these photographs, I was amazed to see the level of compassion and teamwork between the elephants helping the little one. 'From the moment they arrived at the dam, they were protecting the little one. When it slipped and fell in, they quickly came together and with their trunks, helped it out.' The mum and her herd immediately sprung into action - fishing the baby out of the water with their trunks . Adele van Schalkwyk happened to be in the area and snapped several photos of the sweet moment . 'When I took these photographs, I was amazed to see the level of compassion and teamwork,' she said . The 46-year-old photographer named the series Together with Love after one of the photos that shows four of the elephants helping the calf. Miss van Schalkwyk, who said she was happiest when photographing 'the gifts of nature', added: 'They tried to keep the calf away from the water. In one of the photos you can actually see how one uses her trunk to try and keep him away. 'But like a naughty child he did not listen and again slipped and fell.

"A police union chief slammed New York Mayor Bill de Blasio on Thursday for his failure to support city cops following the grand jury decision in the chokehold death of Eric Garner. New York City Patrolmen's Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch criticized de Blasio, saying: 'Unequivocally, police officers feel like they have been thrown under the bus.' Lynch also defended white Officer Daniel Pantaleo's role in the death of unarmed, black father-of-six Mr Garner - even as protesters planned a new round of demonstrations tonight. The union chief said Pantaleo had acted properly in restraining Eric Garner during an arrest attempt in the borough of Staten Island on July 17. 'He's a model of what we want a police officer to be,' Lynch said. Scroll down for video .

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton on Thursday review new police guidelines that will be taught to officers at the Police Academy in Queens, New York . The police spokesman's staunch remarks came hours after commenters on a popular police blog angrily hit back at the widespread public protests and condemnation by political figures over the decision not to indict. The backlash on site, Policeone, came from some claiming police backgrounds and other law-enforcement supporters. The anonymous comments attacked outraged protesters, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, President Obama, Attorney-General Eric Holder and the media for their opposition to the grand jury decision. One post from VON1 read: 'Have you heard the mayor of NY press release. Wow! 35,000 cops just got b****slapped.' Another comment read: 'Stay safe, brothers. You're in for another set of riots.' The blog Policeone, which is dedicated to law enforcement, had a barrage of comments in support of the grand jury decision not to indict Officer Daniel Pantaleo . Black lives matter: More protests were arranged for Thursday as outrage swept across the country following the lack of indictment for New York cop Daniel Pantaleo. Pictured today are students protesting at Emory . New York City erupted in protests on Wednesday after a grand jury decision not to indict Officer Daniel Pantaleo, 29, who grabbed Mr Garner and put him in a chokehold which led to his death on July 17 in Staten Island. In a direct and sometimes passionate speech from Staten Island on Wednesday, Mayor Bill de Blasio made his dismay clear about a jury's decision not to charge Officer Daniel Pantaleo. De Blasio was among several prominent political figures to address the decision. President Obama himself went so far as to concede police racial bias does exist. Obama also revealed he'd spoken with Attorney General Eric Holder about the case. Holder on Wednesday evening announced the Department of Justice's civil rights wing had launched an investigation into the death of 43-year-old father-of-six. Protesters in Minneapolis shut down the Northbound lanes of I-35W amid more demonstrations on Thursday following the failure to indict the cop who put Eric Garner in a chokehold shortly before he died . Protesters rally against police brutality and racism by marching and laying down in the streets in downtown Pittsburgh on Thursday . An emotional de Blasio said the decision of a grand jury not to indict the officer who who put Eric Garner into a fatal chokehold was 'a very painful day for so many New Yorkers'. On the Policeone blog, which  primarily covers law enforcement issues, the comments came thick and fast beneath an article which reported there would be no indictment for Officer Pantaleo. The comments came from police supporters or those claiming to be employed in law enforcement. Esu5 wrote: 'Every now and then we win one. Horrible situation, man lost his life, but like in the Ferguson case he controlled his own destiny.' office1149 posted: 'If you can shout ''I can't breath'' [sic] you can probably breath [sic]!' The comment referred to the numerous times that 43-year-old Mr Garner cried out that he couldn't breathe as officers pinned him to the ground during the video-taped attack before he lost consciousness. Other comments specifically attacked Mayor de Blasio. wasafuzz wrote: 'New York City Mayor and the entire New York City Council sided with criminal of 31 prior arrests Eric Gardner.' Another anonymous comment from, 1661, said: 'Isn't it great how the press minimizes what the criminal did, and vilifies the evil ""White NYC police officer"" portraying him killing a harmless ""unarmed black man."" Here comes Eric Holder with an NYPD consent decree!' A protester faces off with a NYPD officer in New York  Cityduring a protest against the grand jury decision in the Eric Garner case .

SAPDMAS wrote: 'People are sick and tired of thugs. Certain people better wake the hell up and stop supporting the thugs. 2 years 1 month before the head thug gets thrown out and hopefully a real POTUS gets elected.' rbpd1176 simply put it: 'Damn glad I'm retired.' In a deeply personal and heartfelt address, Mayor de Blasion, whose wife Chirlane McCray is African American, said that when he spoke to Eric Garner's bereaved father: 'I couldn't help but immediately think of what it would mean to me to lose (his son) Dante.' With barely a word of support for the NYPD or their cleared officer, de Blasio's used his own son to explain that he knows the struggle and frustration that black people feel when dealing with police in New York City. 'We've had to talk to Dante for years about dangers he may face,' said de Blasio about the infamous 'talk' many parents of African American or mixed-race children have nationwide. 'I've had to worry over the years..Is my child safe? And not just from harsh realities…crimes and violence…are they safe from the people they want to have faith in (cops)?' Calling it a 'national moment of pain', the mayor said that racial profiling and distrust between African Americans and the police is 'a problem for all New Yorkers, it is a problem for all Americans. It's all our problem.' The mayor also said that he had spoken with NYPD Commissioner Bratton about retraining the entire police force. 'It should be self-evident, (but) our history requires us to say 'black lives matter'. The short address at times felt like a line in the sand being drawn by de Blasio, especially when he quoted his commissioner, Bill Bratton on weeding out those who do not belong in law enforcement. 'The department will act aggressively to ensure that any officer who is not meant to be in this work no longer is.' Indeed, he left the air hanging with the question of whether Officer Pantaleo will remain with the NYPD. Earlier, the widow of Eric Garner had exclaimed 'Oh my God, are you serious?' when she discovered the verdict, while de Blasio issued an earlier, equally emotional statement and declared that 'Today's outcome is one that many in our city did not want.' President Obama broke off from a planned speech to address the verdict saying, 'Police brutality is an American problem.' New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio speaks to the media during a news conference in Staten Island after a grand jury  decided not to charge white police officer Daniel Pantaleo who killed unarmed black man Eric Garner with a chokehol . After the decision was released it was announced the NYPD was recalling all officers from non-essential court business in anticipation of potential city-wide disturbances. Staten Island District Attorney Daniel Donovan said the grand jury found 'no reasonable cause' to bring charges against Garner, who was selling loose, un-taxed cigarettes. In the neighborhood where  father-of-six Garner died, people reacted with shouts, chants of 'Eric Garner' and expressions of angry disbelief.  Garner's father, Benjamin Carr, urged calm and said the ruling made no sense. The grand jury could have considered a range of charges, from murder to a lesser offense such as reckless endangerment. 'I am actually astonished based on the evidence of the videotape, and the medical examiner, that this grand jury at this time wouldn't indict for anything,' said a lawyer for Garner's family, Jonathan Moore. The decision, which comes nine days after the Ferguson grand jury declined to indict Officer Darren Wilson, threatens to increase already fraught racial tensions nationwide and lead to more protests. The death of the father-of-six sparked national outrage just weeks before the fatal shooting of Michael Brown amid accusations of police brutality against African Americans. The decision by the grand jury panel means that a majority of them did not think there was probable cause a crime was committed by Pantaleo, who was the only NYPD officer facing indictment. Two other officers at the scene were offered immunity if they testified before the grand jury. The Medical Examiner's Office ruled his death a homicide but police union members have always denied Pantaleo used a chokehold. The medical examiner  concluded the chokehold was the cause of death. Officer Pantaleo issued a statement following the announcement of the grand jury decision to say he felt 'very bad.' 'I became a police officer to help people and to protect those who can't protect themselves,' said Pantaleo. 'It is never my intention to harm anyone and I feel very bad about the death of Mr. Garner. 'My family and I include him and his family in our prayers and I hope that they will accept my personal condolences for their loss.'

"Oprah Winfrey Photoshopped the front cover of the latest issue of her eponymous magazine, which appears to show her lounging alongside an African lion, despite telling her readers they must learn to be braver in the New Year. According to the Huffington Post, Oprah and her cover co-star Beast never actually got the chance to meet due to fears over the 60-year-old's safety. Instead, the 10-year-old lion was photographed the day before the glamorous TV host and was accompanied by his caretaker, who remained on-set throughout the shoot to ensure his every need was catered for. Scroll down for video . Not so brave after all: Oprah and her cover co-star, 10-year-old lion Beast, never actually met and were instead Photoshopped together . Plan b: The 60-year-old TV presenter called on the services of set designer George DeLacy, who dressed up in a lion suit and posed alongside Oprah during her shoot . Eager to ensure the cover shoot was as realistic as possible however, Oprah roped in the help of set designer George DeLacy, who gamely suited up in a full lion costume and posed alongside her so she could get her positioning just right. Speaking about the cover, Oprah, who has previously shared the cover of O, The Oprah Magazine, with the likes of Michelle Obama, Ellen DeGeneres and Rosie O'Donnell, joked that it was one of the most bizarre shoots she has ever done. 'I can honestly say I've never done this before,' she joked, while reclining next to Mr DeLacy. And while Oprah managed to avoid a confrontation with the majestic animal, photographer Ruven Afanador was not so lucky, however he did shoot Beast from inside a reinforced protective cage, to ensure his safety throughout the day. Thus far, Oprah's decision to Photoshop her cover has been met with mixed feelings from readers, some of whom have applauded her 'sensible' choice to respect the animal's natural strength and aggression. Discussing the cover on entertainment forum Nairaland, one Oprah fan said: 'Good for her,' while another added: 'Think it's better that she didn't actually pose with the lion!' The finished product: While the end result looks fantastic, Oprah has faced criticism from some who believe her Photoshop trickery contradicts the theme of the magazine . Caged: Photographer Ruven Afanador shot Beast from inside a reinforced metal structure . There are some, however, who feel Oprah's Photoshop trickery contradicts the overall theme of the January issue, which sees readers urged to 'tame your fears and start living your happiest year yet'. 'Although the theme of the issue is ""Brave New You"", Oprah wasn't actually [brave enough] when it came to posing for the cover,' Refinery 29's Lauren Le Vine wrote. 'See, she and Beast, her 10-year-old African lion cover costar, posed separately. Beast was photographed one day earlier, and his caretaker was on the site to make sure everything went smoothly.' New York Magazine's The Cut's Allison P Davis added: 'Because this cover is meant to inspire a ""Brave New You"" who will conquer 2015 as fearlessly as Oprah lounges next to a ferocious animal while wearing a sophisticated green velvet gown. 'Except not. As these ""behind the scenes"" photos reveal, Oprah only posed with a big stuffed animal, NOT A REAL LION AT ALL.

"For some parents it can feel like their children are never going to leave home, but spare a thought for adult giant armadillos. New research, using automatic camera traps, has shown at these rare and elusive scaly-skinned mammals have to put up with some extremely clingy offspring. Scientists had thought that young giant armadillos struck out on their own to find their own territory at six weeks old, but research shows this is closer to 17 months. Scroll down for video . Remotely triggered camera trap pictures showed that Alex the young giant armadillo was still interacting, often in quite tender moments, with his mother more than a year after he should have become independent . The four year study of the termite-eating creatures revealed the youngsters continue sharing dens with their mothers long after they are capable of looking after themselves. The findings suggest that giant armadillos may be nature's equivalent of human parents who suffer from so-called 'full-nest syndrome', where their adult children stay at home well into their thirties. Dr Arnaud Desbiez, head of the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland's Giant Armadillo Project, made the discovery while studying an adult female armadillo and her baby. Night time camera traps set up in the Pantanal tropical wetlands of Brazil captured the never seen before intimacy between the mother and her son, which scientists called Alex. Dr Desbiez said: 'We discovered that young giant armadillos continue to interact and share dens with their mothers for much longer than previously thought.' He added that although the youngster began exploring and foraging on its own after six months, it continued to share a burrow for at least year after that. Giant armadillos live in burrows in wetland habitats in South America and although normally solitary, mothers seem to allow their offspring to continue living with them for at least a year after they can care for themselves . Dr Desbiez first captured pictures of the wild baby armadillo with his mother in 2012 and was able to watch as he grew up. While spending short amounts of time away from home foraging, Alex continued to regularly interact with her and either share her burrow or stay in another close by. It is still unclear exactly what age young armadillos finally break their ties completely from their mothers as Alex is continuing to cling to his patient mother. Giant armadillos are 'ecosystem engineers' that help to protect other wildlife in the Brazilian wetlands from the searing tropical heat, according to previous work by Dr Arnaud Desbiez. Using camera traps in front 70 giant armadillo burrows to take pictures of animals that came to use the burrows. Published in the journal of Biotropica, the study found that the mounds attracted pumas, tapirs, a type of wild pig called Peccaries along with insects and amphibians. The burrows are thought to provide shelter for the animals from the heat during the day, and cold at night, by providing a stable temperature below ground. Dr Desbiez said: 'Think of them like wine cellars.' Armadillos are the largest members of the Xenarthra order of mammals that includes anteaters and sloths, part of a family that goes back at least 65 million years. Covered in a flexible armour that consists of up to 17  bands of horn and bone, they can grow nearly five feet in length, weigh up to 110lbs and live up to 15 years. They have large powerful claws for tearing into termite mounds. However, observing these creatures in the wild is extremely difficult as they are nocturnal and spend much of their time in their burrows. Giant armadillos are currently categorized as Vulnerable by the IUCN Red List as habitat loss and hunting has reduced their numbers. Dr Desbiez, a French researcher who lives in Pantanal, started studying giant armadillos in 2010, using radio trackers and camera traps in an attempt to learn about their hidden lives. They found that gestation lasts five months instead of four and that they only give birth to one baby at a time, instead of two as had been believed. Dr Desbiez believes the animals only give birth once every two years, meaning they invest huge amounts in raising their young. His findings could also have a dramatic impact on attempts to conserve the mammals, as it means their population growth rates are extremely slow. With such a low birth rate, they can easily go extinct in local areas, he warned. Dr Desbiez was able to follow a mother giant armadillo and her baby, named Alex, from the moment of birth using specially designed night vision cameras that filmed their intimate parenting behaviour . Giant armadillos are rarely seen in the wild as they are nocturnal and tend not to live closely together so most research has been carried out on captive animals that have been kept in zoos . Dr Desbiez said: 'We have made lots exciting discoveries about their ecology and behaviour and interactions with other species and how their burrows are used by other species.' Now he hopes his camera trap images of the giant armadillos can help to raise awareness of the secretive creatures. The pictures he has captured have been awarded a runner up prize in the New Behaviour and Rare Species categories of the BBC Wildlife Magazine Camera-trap Photo of the Year 2014 competition. Dr Desbiez said: 'The worldwide recognition of these rare photographs helps share the wonder and passion we feel for the mysterious giant armadillo. 'Due to its low population density, nocturnal activity and secretive nature, the giant armadillo could become locally extinct without anyone noticing.'","Biologists captured intimate relationship between mother giant armadillo and her baby in the Pantanal tropical wetlands of Brazil .

"Biologists have proved that the gecko's ability to climb and hang from slippery surfaces is effortless. A Tokay gecko is pictured . You may think Spiderman’s ability to scale vertical walls is pretty neat, but the superheroes abilities are nothing compared to a gecko’s. After years of wondering whether the lizards have to exert energy to stick to walls, biologists have proved their talent is effortless. Researchers found that the adhesive power comes purely from the adhesive toe pads on the underside of gecko feet. And they came to this conclusion by sticking dead geckos to slippery surfaces. The lizards, which are found in places with warm climates, can cling to even shiny vertical surfaces with the most remarkable strength. The tests were carried out by biologists at the University of California, Riverside. ‘With regards to geckos, being sticky doesn't require effort,’ Timothy Higham, an assistant professor of biology at the university said. Together with William Stewart, a postdoctoral researcher in his lab, Assistant Professor Higham found that ‘dead geckos maintain the ability to adhere with the same force as living animals, eliminating the idea that strong adhesion requires active control.’ ‘Death affects neither the motion nor the posture of clinging gecko feet. ‘We found no difference in the adhesive force or the motion of clinging digits between our before- and after-death experiments.’ For years, it has been presumed that the ability to stick to surfaces has required muscle activity instigated by a gecko to push its foot and toes onto a surface to enhance adhesion. Researchers proved the sticking power simply comes from the adhesive toe pads (pictured) on the underside of gecko feet, by proving that even dead geckos can stick to walls. For years, it was presumed the ability required muscle activity instigated by a gecko to push its foot and toes onto a surface to enhance adhesion . Geckos climb on a wide variety of surfaces, including smooth surfaces such as glass. They have adhesive pressures of 15 to 30 pounds (6.8kg to 13.6kg) per square inch for each limb, meaning a gecko can hang its entire body by one toe. A gecko's toe consists of a microscopic hierarchical structure of stalk-like setae - 100 microns in length, 2 microns in radius. From individual setae, a bundle of hundreds of terminal tips called spatulae - approximately 200 nanometers in diameter at their widest - branch out and contact the climbing surface. These hairs create an electrostatic force known as Van der Waals. It causes neighbouring molecules to be attracted to each other. Although very weak, the effect is multiplied by thousands of tiny hairs that cover a gecko's toes, allowing them to stick firmly to surfaces. To test the well-held belief, the biologists used a device involving a controlled pulling system. This device applied increasing pulling forces to a gecko foot and measured ‘clings’ by pulling it in a controlled manner along a vertical acrylic sheet. It also recorded adhesion with video cameras. The experiments showed that the adhesive force, or motion, of a gecko foot when pulled along a vertical surface was similarly high and variable when the gecko was alive and immediately - within 30 minutes - after death. Geckos can climb a variety of surfaces, including smooth glass. Their sticky toes have even inspired climbing devices, such as so-called Spider-Man gloves. The toe pads on the underside of gecko feet contain tiny hair-like structures called setae, which stick to surfaces through frictional forces as well as forces between molecules, called van der Waals. These tiny structures are so strong that the setae on a single foot can support 20 times the gecko's body weight. The controlled experiments  are the first to show that dead animals maintain the ability to adhere with the same force as living animals. The results refute the notion that actions by a living gecko, such as muscle recruitment or neural activity, are required for gecko feet to generate forces. ‘With regards to geckos, being sticky doesn't require effort,’ Timothy Higham, an assistant professor of biology at the university said. A live Tokay gecko is shown . ‘The idea that adhesion can be entirely passive could apply to many different kinds of adhesion, Professor Higham said. ‘This is clearly a cost-effective way of remaining stationary in a habitat. For example, geckos could perch on a smooth vertical surface and sleep for the night - or day - without using any energy.’ The new work suggests that the ‘active’ component of gecko adhesion is actually a reduction of adhesion force when the gecko lifts its feet by curling up the tips of the digits, while the rest of the foot remains on the surface. Dr Stewart explained: ‘We found that the dead animals were more likely to experience damage to their adhesive system, which suggests that the active control may actually prevent injury. ‘In other words, when the forces become too high, the gecko likely releases the system using its muscles.’ The study, which was published in the journal Biology Letters, may now be used to develop new robots. A climbing system inspired by geckos has turned Spider-Man fiction into fact by making it possible for a human to scale vertical glass. During tests, an 11-stone (70kg) volunteer crawled up a 12ft (3.6 metre) pane using just sticky attachments on his hands and feet. The gadgets employ the same natural molecular forces that allow gecko lizards to scurry around on ceilings.

Although very weak, the effect is multiplied by thousands of tiny hairs that cover a gecko's toes, allowing them to stick firmly to surfaces. Scientists created tiny tiles called 'microwedges' to generate Van der Waals forces and produce a dry adhesive even more efficient than the gecko's. During the experiment, the volunteer testing these microwedge attachments simply peeled them on and off the glass. The US team led by Dr Elliot Hawkes, from Stanford University, wrote in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface: 'Using this system, a human of mass 70 kilograms (11 stone) successfully ascended a 3.6-metre (11 ft) vertical glass wall with 140 square centimetres of gecko-inspired dry adhesives in each hand. 'The synthetic adhesion system creates a nearly uniform load distribution across the whole adhesive area, improving upon the adhesive-bearing structures of a gecko's toe and enabling a human to climb vertical glass using an area of adhesive no larger than the area of a human hand.' The demonstration was reminiscent of the way Spiderman scales skyscrapers in the Marvel comics and films, (illustrated left), as well as the way Tom Cruise clings to the Burj Khalifa in Dubai during Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol (pictured right)","Biologists examined the stickiness of live and dead geckos in a lab .

"Crows use tools and can even outsmart a human child, and now scientists have found another way in which the birds are like us. In tests, the birds revealed a tendency to be either left or right beaked. Researchers studying New Caledonia crows discovered the clever corvids display a preference for holding a stick tool on a certain side of their beaks -  and this could be to make the most of their wide field of vision. Crows show a tendency to be left or right beaked by holding tools such as sticks (pictured) on the right or left side of their beaks. Researchers believe the birds may be trying to keep the tip of the stick in view of the eye on the opposite side of their heads in order to use it in the most dexterous way . Researchers believe the birds may be trying to keep the tip of the stick in view of the eye on the opposite side of their heads, so they can see clearly in order to use tools in the most dexterous way. Lead scientist Dr Alejandro Kacelnik, from Oxford University, said: ‘If you were holding a brush in your mouth and one of your eyes was better than the other at brush length, you would hold the brush so that its tip fell in view of the better eye. This is what the crows do.’ New Caledonian crows have surprised experts with their ability to use sticks to extract larvae from burrows and, in captivity, retrieve food placed out of reach. The new study, published in the journal Current Biology, also suggests that the birds' unusually wide field of vision actually helps them to see better with one eye. New Caledonian crows (stock image) have surprised experts with their ability to use sticks to extract larvae from burrows and, in captivity, retrieve food placed out of reach. And now the new study suggests that the birds' unusually wide field of vision actually helps them to see better with one eye . A previous experiment by the University of Cambridge proved that members of the crow family aren’t just among the cleverest birds, they are smarter than most mammals - and can perform tasks that three and four-year-old children have difficulty with. Scientists said that, while having very different brain structures, both crows and primates use a combination of mental tools, including imagination and the anticipation of possible future events, to solve similar problems. Other experiments involving the same family of birds found that Caledonian crows can use up to three tools in sequence to obtain food. The University of Oxford’s Behavioural Ecology Research Group said this was the first demonstration of spontaneous sequential tool use in a species other than humans. A separate study also found rooks can use stones to raise the level of water in a vessel in order to bring a floating worm into reach. Urban-living carrion crows have been witnessed learning to use road traffic for cracking nuts. Co-author Dr Antone Martinho, also from Oxford University, said: ‘We thought that their binocular fields would facilitate binocular vision, perhaps allowing the birds to judge the distance from tool tip to target. 'It turned out that, most frequently, they only see the tool tip and target with one eye at a time.’ Dr Kacelnik added: ‘Birds and humans face similar problems in tool use and many other activities. 'Studying similar problems across species helps to put all of them in perspective.’ Scientists at the Language, Culture and Cognition lab at the University of Auckland have been studying the intelligence of tool-making New Caledonian crows for over 10 years. They have shown that crows can use tools to solve eight problems in a row. In February, Dr Alex Taylor, a Lecturer in Evolutionary Psychology set up an experiment in which a crow, named 007, performed a series of tasks without seeing the difficult course beforehand. The wild crow learned to use individual props during its three months of captivity, but had to work out the order in which to use them to complete the challenge and get an inaccessible treat. The animal was later released. 007 completed the eight-stage puzzle in just two-and-a-half minutes. First, it pulled a string attached to the branch it perched on towards itself to reach a short stick dangling below. A crow, named 007, performed a series of tasks without seeing a difficult course made up of eight problems, beforehand (illustrated). The bird completed the eight-stage puzzle in just two-and-a-half minutes . Crows have a reasoning ability rivalling that of a human seven-year-old, research has shown. Scientists came to the conclusion after subjecting six wild New Caledonian crows to a battery of tests designed to challenge their understanding of cause and effect. The tasks were all variations of the Aesop's fable, in which a thirsty crow drops stones to raise the level of water in a pitcher. In the 'water displacement task', crows worked out how to catch floating food rewards by dropping heavy objects into water-filled tubes. They demonstrated an ability to drop sinking rather than floating objects, solid rather than hollow objects, to choose a high water level tube over one with low water level, and a water-filled tube over one filled with sand. The birds' understanding of the effects of volume displacement matched that of human children aged between five and seven, scinetists from the Univesrity of Auckland claimed. The crow then picked up the short stick in its mouth to complete stage one. It then immediately made its way to a narrow container containing a meaty treat and tried to use the stick to reach it - but it was too short. The bird kept hold of the stick and made its way to the first of three boxes, which each contained a stone unreachable without the stick behind wooden bars. 007 then used its stick to drag a stone from the first box and picked it up in its beak to complete stage two. But then it dropped the stone, seemingly temporarily stumped as what to do with it. However, the persistent creature picked up the stick again and retrieved a stone from the second of the boxes and placed it in a separate perspex container. 007 picked up the stone it had already retrieved and posted it into the clear container too, before retrieving the final stone from the final box. When it posted the last of the stones into the perspex box, its weight pushed down a compartment, which allowed the crow to access a long stick and complete stage eight. Armed with the long stick, the crow immediately used it to poke inside a narrow box treat containing a treat and dragged the morsel towards itself. The clever bird was rewarded for its hard work and mental agility in completing the series of eight challenges.","Scientists from Oxford University showed the birds display a preference for holding a stick tool on the right or left side of their beaks .

"The Army completed its investigation last week into Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl's disappearance from a base in Afghanistan five years ago, but the Pentagon said Tuesday that it doesn't know when the report will be released. 'The investigating officer has done his work, but now that work is moving through the Army system, and at each stop ... there will ... be questions, requirements for clarification,' Army Colonel Steve Warren told reporters. 'So it's working its way through the system as would any other investigation.' The results of the Army's probe into whether Bergdahl deserted his post will most certainly be withheld from the public until after November's elections, if it discloses its findings at all. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl was freed from captivity in May after Obama traded him for five Taliban commanders. Platoon mates of Bergdahl say he deserted but the Army is yet to release its formal report . The Pentagon's announcement has Republicans and former platoon mates of Bergdahl's wondering what's taking so long, as the facts of the case appear fairly cut and dried on the surface. According to soldiers who served with Bergdahl, the 28-year-old willingly abandoned his base several days before he was kidnapped by the Taliban and taken hostage in June of 2009. For nearly five years he was held captive by the terrorist organization until President Barack Obama and the Pentagon negotiated his release last May. Acting on his own authority, Obama traded five Taliban commanders who were being held in detention at Guantanamo Bay for the release of Bergdahl, who is now living and working at a base in San Antonio, Texas. Bergdahl has not spoken out publicly since his return to the U.S. and has reportedly refused to meet with his family in person. In June the Army announced that Maj. Gen. Kenneth Dahl, a veteran of two tours in Afghanistan, would lead it's official review of Bergdahl's conduct. The two-star general, who also serves as the deputy commanding general of 1st Corps at Joint Base Lewis McChord in Washington state, interviewed Bergdahl in August. If cleared of wrong doing, Sgt. Bergdahl stands to receive $200,000 in back pay and $150,000 compensation for his troubles. The Army said on Friday that it had received Dahl's report and its 'reviewing it,' but it has no timeline for the completion of its audit. 'As we stressed at on the onset, this will be a lengthy process conducted in accordance with applicable laws, regulation and policy,' Army officials said in a statement. 'We recognize the importance of the media and the public understanding of our investigative process, and look forward to future discussions on this issue. The statement went on to say that 'the Army's priority is ensuring that our process is thorough, factually accurate, impartial, and legally correct.' 'Consequently, at this time, it would be inappropriate to speculate on the potential results or the amount of time the review process will take to complete.' Reuters says that Colonel Warren, the Pentagon's spokesperson, denied on Tuesday that the military was postponing the release of the report until after Election Day in order to give the president and his his political party cover from the potentially damning details of the probe.

Bergdahl's former platoon leader, Sgt. Evan Buetow, and Army Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Peters, a frequent Fox guest, joined Fox News' Sean Hannity to discuss the Army's announcement that it had not reached a verdict yet, even though the general conducting the investigation has finished his report . 'There's no way that they can conclude this investigation without the truth,' Buetow told Hannity. The truth, he said, is that Bergdahl deserted. 'There's not one person [from his platoon] who disagrees,' Buetow claimed . But members of Bergdahl's unit say they don't understand why the Army's assessment is taking so long. Bergdahl's former platoon leader, Sgt. Evan Buetow, has said on numerous occasions that after Bergdahl, then a private in the army, went missing, soldiers in his unit learned from locals they were observing over the radio that an American was wandering around town, looking for someone who spoke English so that he could communicate with the Taliban. 'We've come out when he first got released, and we explained exactly what happened. He deserted his post, all on his own, and we're now still sitting here waiting for answers,' Buetow told Fox News host Sean Hannity on Tuesday evening. Buetow said he was interviewed Gen. Dahl and had a 'lengthy' conversation with him about the details of Bergdahl's disappearance, including the chatter the platoon heard over the radio. 'I have a list of the people that the general spoke to during this investigation,' Buetow told Hannity. 'It's everyone from the platoon, and I know exactly what they said. 'There's no way that they can conclude this investigation without the truth.' The truth, Buetow said, is that Bergdahl deserted. 'There's not one person [from his platoon] who disagrees,' Buetow said. Another former platoon mate of Bergdahl's, Sgt. Jordan Vaughn, said Wednesday on Fox and Friends that he's also suspicious of delay, given that the military had 'five years to investigate this, talk to everyone who was there, who was involved, talk to the family, check the emails, look at the facts.' 'The only thing that was missing here, the only piece, is Bergdahl himself talking to him,' he said. Vaughn suggested that part of the problem is that Dahl is not qualified to conduct the probe. 'I really want to see the line of questioning presented by Major General Dahl given that he is not an army investigator,' Vaughn said. Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl is pictured here in an undated photo provided to reporters by the Army. If Bergdahl is cleared of desertion charges, he'll receive $200,000 in back pay and stands to gain another $150,000 in compensation for his ordeal . He later referred to Dahl as a 'general that has no experience' leading 'a line of questioning in a criminal investigation.' 'What are Gen. Dahl's credentials?' he asked. Vaughn said if the Army doesn't release its finished review to the public, he and other members of Bergdahl's platoon would 'look into filing a Freedom of Information Act' to obtain the report. Fox's Kimberly Guilfoyle, who was filling in this morning for regular Fox and Friends host Elisabeth Hasselbeck, commented that it seemed 'very politically expedient' that the Army is delaying the release of its report until after the election. On Tuesday night, Hannity noted that 'the Army says politics has nothing to do with' the protracted wait. 'I'm not sold,' he said. Army Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Peters, a frequent Fox guest, told Hannity later in the show that he, too, believes the Obama administration may have asked the Army to sit on the verdict of its investigation until after Nov. 4. 'When it comes to why it's being withheld, it's obvious. It's gotta be withheld until after the election because no matter which way the report goes, Obama loses,' he said. 'If the White House was able to exert sufficient pressure on the chain of command in the Pentagon to whitewash Bergdahl's actions, then there's gonna be this huge outcry from those serving in uniform, from veterans from conservatives,' he noted. On the other hand, he said, 'if it turns out that the Army got some backbone and really looked at what Bergdahl did, listened to people like Sgt. Buetow and his platoon mates, and finds that, yes, he should be charged with desertion, well then the Rose Garden ceremony looks like an even greater debacle.' 'So Obama has dug himself into a very deep hole, and he can't stop digging,' he said, referring to a news conference the president held at the White House on the day of Bergdahl's release with the sergeant's parents. Peters claimed that he has 'nothing personal' against Sgt. Bergdahl and that he's never met him. 'This is about a much greater issue than one individual who appears to have deserted from his post and left his comrades behind in war time,' he explained. 'The principle is this: the Obama administration really despises our military, in my view. And they understand why Bergdahl would desert, they just don't understand why anybody would join the military. Returning back to the topic at hand, Peters said that 'if there's a whitewash, and Bergdahl walks with all his back pay and stuff, the travesty, the precedent it sets for all future wars is that, ""Hey dude, it's OK, man. You don't like what's going on, walk away, we'll cover for you."" 'That's profoundly wrong,' he concluded.","The Army completed its probe into Bergdahl last week, but the Pentagon said Tuesday it doesn't know when the report will be released .

"Cara, the bushy-browed supermodel has inspired a massive increase in enquiries . The 'power brow' shows no sign of falling out of fashion thanks to Cara Delevingne. According to a cosmetic surgery group the bushy-browed supermodel has inspired a massive increase in the number of women looking to fill in their sparse eyebrows with a transplant. New stats from Transform reveal that they have seen enquiries about eyebrow transplants - which cost about £1,500 - increase by 45 per cent since 2010. The average age of those enquiring is 30, and the group report that 70 per cent of callers admit they have previously over-plucked. Despite the hefty price tag more women than ever are now considering paying out for the treatment. Transform believes this is in part due to many finding that the 90s trend for thin, over-plucked eyebrows has left them with sparse brows - and what it is calling 'the Delevingne effect'. Cara’s coveted brows are so popular that they even have their own social media accounts, with one Twitter account boasting almost 5,000 followers, reports the Express. Hair transplant surgeon at Transform, Dr Mabroor Bhatty, said: 'The rise in enquires for this treatment comes mainly from women who have previously over-plucked, which can permanently damage the follicle leaving them with thinning or virtually no eyebrows. 'As fashions have changed, women are looking to reverse these effects with the treatment. 'Eyebrow transplant procedures are performed in the same way as a hair transplant, by taking a strip of hair from the donor site; usually at the back of the head at the lower hair margin, where the hair is finer. 'This strip is divided into single hair follicles before each follicle is individually transplanted to incisions made in the eyebrows. 'As is the case with a standard hair transplant, it is normal to see hairs falling out for the first six weeks. However, new hair will grow on average between two to three months after the procedure, creating the desired thickening effect.' Cara Delevingne walks the runway during the Chanel show at Paris Fashion Week Haute-Couture . But the follically challenged need not despair if their brows are more Sarah Harding than Cara Delevingne: we have entered the age of the eyebrow extension. The process, Brow Perfect, involves carefully gluing individual synthetic hairs onto existing fine hairs, or directly onto the skin. This latest launch from company Lash Perfect aims to fill in gaps, add volume and extend the brow line. Eyebrow extensions can attach to existing hairs or onto skin, Ideal for people with no brows or no hair at all . The salon treatment is aimed at those experiencing age-related hair loss or those who have over-plucked or waxed their brows in the past. The process gives a texture and realistic look to brows that pencils and pencils and powders can't attain, say Lash Perfect. The brow extensions are available in different shades and can be glued on to create the type of arch desired. 'We do eyebrows to suit the age and shape of each individual customer,' explains Beverly Piper, owner and director of Lash Perfect. 'Nobody's brows are the same,' she says. 'People find they have natural gaps, or perhaps they over plucked when they were younger. 'Up until now, the only way to bride the gap was to use powder or a pencil, which gives a flat look. But now you can have depth and dimension with the eyebrow extensions.' The beauty professional recognises fashion's influence on modern women's love of big brows. 'Cara Delevingne has amazing brows and carries them off beautifully. She has given women the license to wear their eyebrows boldly and beautifully without needing them trimmed all the time,' says Piper. 'Brow Perfect is all about bold and beautiful brows. Fashions do change but gaps in brows will never be in.' Ideal clients are those with hair loss or those who have over-plucked or waxed their brows in the past . Individual synthetic hairs are glued to the eyebrow, onto existing fine hairs, or directly onto the skin . Cara has encouraged women to wear their eyebrows 'boldly and beautifully', says the company behind the new brow extensions .

"For the first time, evidence of frankincense being used in the elaborate burials of Roman Britain's elite has been discovered. Archaeologists have been able to prove that the religious resin was used by wealthy Romans, who settled in areas of the country, including London and York, more than 1,700 years ago. The sweet smelling substance, which was more valuable than gold for millennia, was found on skeletal remains and plaster body casings dating back to the 3rd and 4th centuries. Frankincense (pictured), one of the gifts carried by the Three Kings in the Christmas story, was used in elaborate burials in Roman Britain more than 1,700 years ago, according to new research . The discovery shows that even while the Roman Empire was in decline, the precious resin was being transported to its furthest northern outpost for use in funerals of high ranking individuals. Until now, evidence for the use of resins in ancient funerary rites has rarely come to light outside of Egypt. The discovery was made by carrying out molecular analysis of materials previously thought to be of little interest – debris inside burial containers and residues on bones - which looked like mere dust. Chemical analysis carried out on 49 burials in Dorset, Wiltshire, London and York revealed traces of the southern Arabian sap from the Boswellia sacra tree, on four of them. Another 10 contained evidence of other resins from the Mediterranean and northern Europe. It’s the first time archaeologists have been able to prove that Frankincense was used by Romans who settled in Britain. Traces of the resin were found inside the coffin of a wealthy Roman woman who was buried in the fourth century AD in London, or Londonium as it was known. Her silt-filled coffin is shown left and bust, right . Frankincense comes from the resinous sap from a unique family of Boswelia trees. Only one, Boswelia sacra, produces the highest grade of frankincense, also known as ‘true’ or ‘commercial’ incense. Careful incisions are made in the tree at key times of year, and the sap slowly pours out. Once the sap dries and hardens it is ready to be used. To release its scent the frankincense is either burned or smouldered over hot coals. Classical texts claim that the aromatic, antimicrobial substances were used as a practical measure to mask the smell of decay, or slow decomposition during the often lengthy funeral rites of the Roman elite. But it was Frankincense’s ritual importance that justified its transportation from one end of the Empire to the other. Seen both as gifts from the gods and to the gods, resins were thought to purify the dead and help them negotiate the final rite of passage to the afterlife. Rhea Brettell, a student at the University of Bradford, explained: ‘Archaeologists have relied on finding visible resin fragments to substantiate the descriptions of burial rites in classical texts, but these rarely survive. ‘Our alternative approach of analysing grave deposits to find the molecular signatures of the resins - which fortunately are very distinctive - has enabled us to carry out the first systematic study across a whole province.’ The resins were only recovered from burials of higher status individuals, identified from the type of container used, the clothing they were wearing, and items buried with them. Professor Carl Heron from the university said: ‘It is remarkable the first evidence for the use of frankincense in Britain should come from such seemingly unpromising samples, yet our analysis demonstrates that traces of these exotic resins can survive for over 1,700 years in what others would reject as dirt.’ Classical texts mention these aromatic, antimicrobial substances as being used as a practical measure to mask the smell of decay or slow decomposition during the often lengthy funeral rites of the Roman elite. The resin was also presented to the baby Jesus by the Magi (illustrated) One of the frankincense-impregnated coffins contained the remains of a noble woman, who was laid to rest with expensive jewellery. The rich young lady was buried in a sarcophagus in the fourth century and her remains were discovered near Spitalfields Market in the City of London in 1999. Dr Rebecca Redfern, of the Museum of London, which is home to the remains, said: ‘This eye-opening study has provided us with new and amazing insights into the funerary rituals of late Roman Britain. The research, published in the Journal of Archaeological Science, mentions resins from three different plant families, including pistacia from the Mediterranean or the Levant, Pinaceae from northern Europe and Boswellia (frankincense) from southern Arabia and eastern Africa. The Romans, Greeks, Egyptians and Israelites all used frankincense as part of their religious ceremonies. It was extensively used in burial rituals as an embalming material, an offering to the departed, and a means to cover the odour of the dead body. The Roman emperor, Nero, burned an entire year’s harvest at the funeral of his favourite mistress and the resin of course featured in the Christmas Story, which is where many westerners recognise it from. Frankincense comes from the resinous sap from the Boswelia sacra tree (pictured) and the sap is extracted by making careful incisions in the tree's bark .","Experts at the University of Bradford analysed Roman coffins and bones .

"Stuart Lancaster believes England's latest injury setback will not damage his side's prospects of toppling the southern hemisphere superpowers this autumn.

It is the latest blow to have struck England with Geoff Parling, Alex Corbisiero, Mako Vunipola, Tom Youngs, Dan Cole, Ed Slater, Tom Croft and Manu Tuilagi also ruled out of the entire series.

"Liverpool have sent striker Daniel Sturridge to Los Angeles to continue his rehabilitation from the thigh injury which has sidelined him for most of the season. The 25-year-old has not played for the club since August 31 after he initially strained a thigh on international duty with England. On the eve of his comeback he pulled a calf muscle in his first full training session back with the first team and just when he appeared to have got over that he sustained another, different, thigh injury which has ruled him out until the new year. 25-year-old Daniel Sturridge has not played for Liverpool since August and will be out until next year . The striker first injured his thigh while on international duty with England earlier this season . Ankle ligaments - England v Republic of Ireland May 2013, returned for pre-season. Ankle ligaments - December 2013. Missed nine games. Thigh - during England training, September 2014. Missed six weeks. Calf - during Liverpool training, October 2014. Missed three weeks. Thigh - during Liverpool training, November 2014. Out for six weeks. Reds manager Brendan Rodgers said last month that the club may have to look even deeper into the root of Sturridge's problems, of which this is the ninth separate but similar injury has had in his career, with the player suggesting the issue may be hereditary as his father, a trainee at Birmingham, and two uncles Dean and Simon - both professional footballers - also suffered the same problems. It is understood the striker has travelled to America to undergo warm-weather training and rehabilitation to help with his recovery for a fortnight. He has not gone to the United States to have any medical treatment or procedure. Sturridge scores for Liverpool during their 2-1 victory over Southampton on the first day of the season . 'He has gone away to get some specific work in with some of our staff and he is coming along well,' said Rodgers. Sturridge's absence has been compounded by the failure of £16million summer signing Mario Balotelli to pick up the slack having yet to score a Premier League goal. He too came back injured from the last international break and has not been available since because of a groin problem, forcing Rodgers to pick Rickie Lambert who has responded with two goals in his first two matches leading the line and has put in good performances in the two games since then. With Balotelli facing a possible Football Association charge for posting an apparently anti-Semetic and racist graphic on social media - for which he has until 6pm on Friday to give his explanation to the FA - the spotlight has only intensified on the troubled Italy international. Rodgers insists, however, that until the 24-year-old is available to play he cannot waste much time thinking about him. Mario Balotelli is facing a possible FA charge for posting an allegedly anti-Semitic graphic on Instagram . 'He is a very much a Liverpool player but he is injured at the moment and there is not much more to add from me,' he said. 'He is not fit to play, my concentration at this moment is on players who are fit and available to play and that is my only thinking at the moment. 'He is working with the medical team on a daily basis and I trust the team of people here to look after injuries. 'At this moment in time the team is doing well and whenever he is back fit then we will see where he is at. 'Hopefully he will be available sooner rather than later.' Balotelli, laughing in the stands, has struggled to fill the void left by Sturridge's injury . While the debate continues over Steven Gerrard's future in light of the club's contract offer, which he has not yet accepted, Rodgers has to concern himself with the more immediate issue associated with the midfielder. Having previously admitted the 34-year-old cannot play three matches in a week, effectively the Reds boss has to decide whether to retain his captain in the starting line-up to face Sunderland on Saturday or hold him back for Tuesday's must-win Champions League tie at home to Basle, which is followed by a trip to Manchester United the following Sunday. 'The only focus is our next game but of course you are having to plan forward and look at one or two teams down the line,' said Rodgers, who this week had to quash reports there had been a disagreement between him and Gerrard. 'If you rest someone they are rotated, if they are rotated they are dropped, if he is dropped he is left out so you can't win as a manager. 'I'll always pick a team which I think can win the game.'","Daniel Sturridge has not played for Liverpool since the end of August .

"Ladies and gents, put down your technology and have more sex. That's the advice from a team of scientists who found people are becoming so enveloped by their phone and tablets that their love lives are being put on the back burner. So if you are one of those reading this on your smartphone in bed, a glance across the sheets is likely to reveal your partner is engrossed in theirs too. The researchers discovered 70 per cent of women said smartphones were interfering in their romantic relationship. The study said technology and the screens that consume us are creating 'technoference' in couples. A new study has found 70 per cent of women believe smartphones are interfering with their love lives, creating 'technoference' between couples (file picture) That ranges from picking up the phone while partners are casually hanging out to checking Facebook while in the middle of an argument. 'You see it everywhere', said Sarah Coyne, psychologist at Brigham Young University and an author of the study. 'Like at a restaurant where couples have their phones, both of them, on the table, right there. I think that is so easy for them to pick it up if it buzzes.' The study surveyed 143 married or cohabiting heterosexual women and asked them about their phone, TV, computer and tablet habits. It also asked about how their partner used technology, if there was any conflict about using technology, and about their satisfaction with their relationship and life overall. The participants said computers were the most interfering technology in their relationship, followed by mobiles. They also reported that of five scenarios presented to them, the most common interference was seeing a partner pick up his phone during 'couple leisure time', with 62 per cent of women reporting this happened at least once a day. Experts have advised banishing smartphones and tablets from the bedroom to spice up your love life . Relationships expert Alison Bruzek, writing on the NPR website, said 40 per cent of women said their men would get distracted by the TV during a conversation at least once a day, while a third said he would take out his phone in the middle of a conversation or during a meal together. A quarter said their partner would actually send texts or emails to another person while they were having a face-to-face conversation. But worse than the intrusions was the way they made the women feel; they found, as you might expect, that conflict over technology was associated with poorer relationships, which in turn were associated with lower life satisfaction. Michelle Drouin, developmental psychologist at Indiana University and Purdue University, Fort Wayne, said: 'With mobile phone technology emerging on the scene as quickly as it did, we all jumped into computer-mediated interactions without really thinking much about the implications.' However, this study involved a small group of women, and the researchers acknowledge that these correlations could be due to other factors affecting a person's well-being. But for those feeling similarly aggravated by smartphone interrupts, the authors say the answer isn't to completely remove technology from the relationship. 'It's not silly for couples to make rules about technology,' said Dr Coyne. 'Just having the discussion about what's OK and what's not when it comes to devices at the dinner table or in the bedroom can help.' Her own method: 'Put [the phone] out of my reach, like on top of the refrigerator, just so that it releases the temptation.' The study was published in the journal Psychology of Popular Media Culture.","Scientists found 70% of women said smartphones were interfering in their love lives, creating a 'technoference' in couples .

"Those with a fear of flying may want to look away now. Lukla Airport boasts the dubious honour of being known as the world's most dangerous airport and one look at its unique airstrip will explain why. With a fall of 9,200 ft awaiting passengers at the end of the runaway, flying to or from this Asian destination is not for the faint of heart. Braced for impact: A plane pictured coming into land at Nepal's Lukla Airport - the most dangerous landing strip in the world . Pressure: Tenzing-Hillary Airport in Lukla, Khumbu, eastern Nepal, doesn't have a control tower, radar or navigation devices - meaning pilots have to rely on what they can see from their cockpit to land and takeoff . Tenzing-Hillary Airport, also known as Lukla Airport, is a single landing strip in the town of Lukla, in Khumbu, eastern Nepal, and has been named by the History Channel and many seasoned travellers as being the most dangerous airport in the world. These photographs, captured by photographer Wojciech Zwierzynski, 34, capture the petrifying landing. 'It was a very scary experience flying in the airship, mainly because two days before my flight, the plane from the same company had crashed and 14 people died,' said Wojciech. 'This airport in Lukla does not have any radar or navigation devices; so the pilot can only depend on what they can see from the plane's cockpit. Don't look down: The tiny runway ends at a cliff edge with a 9,200ft drop to the ground below . Daunting: This image shows the view from the cockpit of a plane coming in to land at Lukla Airport . 'Because the airport is on the mountain ridge, when you start descending you have to land. There is no option to stop descending and have a second try.' With a sloped runway just 20 meters wide and 460 meters long, less than a tenth of the length of the standard 5,500 metres at international airports, this is one of the steepest approach pathways in the world. Since the 1970's, Lukla airport has had an astonishing amount of accidents, with the number now reaching into the double figures. The most severe accident to date being the 8th October 2008 flight, where the aircraft crashed on final approach and caught fire, killing eighteen passengers and crew. Challenging: The 460 metre long runway - less than a tenth of the length of those at international airports - is also situated on a steep incline . Brave travellers: A group of passengers on a plane coming into land at the most dangerous airport in the world . All aboard: A group of tourists wait to board a plane departing from Lukla Airport. The airport is the main route for those trying to reach the Everest Region . And for those looking to scale Mount Everest, Lukla Airport is the nerve rattling start of many expeditions. Wojciech says: 'There are two ways to reach the Everest Region - fly 45min from Lukla Airport or hike for approximately five days. Needless to say most of people chose the first option. 'Tourists are the ""golden vain"" for local community. They spend money in lodges, hotels and restaurants. 'Without the airstrip the number of tourists visiting the area will be significantly lower.' A plane begins to lift off the ground just a few metres before the end of the runway and the 9,200ft drop .

Semesa Rokoduguni and Jonny May are expected to start on the wings against New Zealand . Stuart Lancaster chose to omit Chris Ashton from his side in order to give Rokoduguni a chance to impress . But he and his assistants chose to omit Chris Ashton from the national squad and in his absence, Rokoduguni will start on the right as the in-form winger in the Aviva Premiership this season. When the line-up is officially confirmed on Thursday the Fijian-born flier will be at No 14 to continue his astonishing career progression. The 27-year-old joined Bath only two years ago and is still a serving soldier in the British Army having seen action in Afghanistan’s Helmand Province as a tank driver with the famous ‘Desert Rats’ armoured brigade. Rokoduguni will become the first serving soldier to win an international cap for England since Tim Rodber 15 years ago. His Test debut will complete an epic journey from his Fijian village, Naselai, where he couldn’t break into the rugby team because his uncle was a better winger. Having already lost Manu Tuilagi to a recurring groin injury, the coaches were forced to rule Northampton centre Luther Burrell out of the autumn opener against the world champions because of a hand problem. It will mean that England do not have established try-scoring clout behind the scrum. Among the backs who will start against New Zealand, scrum-half Danny Care has the highest tally, with seven. Mike Brown has touched down five times, Owen Farrell twice and centres Kyle Eastmond and Brad Barritt once. In contrast, the All Blacks come to Twickenham armed with the most predatory finisher in the world. Julian Savea has 29 tries from 30 Test appearances. Ashton had a decent record of 19 tries in 39 matches, but he has fallen out of favour due to perceived flaws in his game. Explaining the thinking in terms of wing selection, Lancaster said: ‘A lot of the players now — a Jack Nowell, Anthony Watson or Jonny May — are comfortable on either wing. The decision will be based on who we think are the best guys to deliver that balance in the back line — the ability to punch and get through the line, have the physicality and also have the back-field and defensive understanding that we’ll need.' The England team warm up during a training session at Pennyhill  ahead of their match against New Zealand . Saracens star Owen Farrell practices his kicking during an England training session on Monday . Referring to dealing with New Zealand’s kicking game, he added: ‘That reading of body language is key. That’s one thing Jonny and Jack did well in the Six Nations, particularly against Ireland — Jonny Sexton has a very accurate and intelligent kicking game. It’s about being up in the line and also reading the body language to have the back-field covered.’ After having to contend with a stream of bad news relating to players’ fitness, Lancaster had some brighter bulletins to savour on Monday. His leading available props, Joe Marler and David Wilson, were able to return to full training and Billy Vunipola has recovered from concussion sufficiently to reclaim his starting place at No 8. Farrell appeared to be labouring on his most recent appearance for Saracens, after a month out with a quad injury, but Lancaster said: ‘There’s no residue of injury whatsoever. In terms of the way he’s making his decisions and leading the group, he’s exactly where he left off with us in the second Test (in June).’ Eastmond was another who was struggling last week, as he recovered from a rib injury. But he has been backed to line up at inside centre and make light of his first-half horror in Hamilton during England’s last Test, five months ago. ‘Kyle has come back to Bath, he’s been defensively excellent, a great attacking threat and he looks confident,’ said Lancaster. England’s front-five options have been slashed by early- season injuries but Lancaster has no qualms about promoting Dave Attwood to partner Courtney Lawes in the second row in place of Launchbury. ‘They are quite similar players,’ he said. ‘Dave is probably a stronger right-hand lock. He is a very good scrummaging second row. ‘He has changed his game this season — he’s lost a bit of weight and played exceptionally well for Bath. It was Dave’s decision. He felt he could maintain his power but become more mobile around the field. But he’s still a big fella and he will bring a physicality to our game because of his power.’","Gloucester wing Jonny May will return to the starting XV .

"Behind the scenes the discreet Marina Granovskaia has long been one of the most powerful women in football. But now the Russian is set to become even more influential as she is tipped to take over as Chelsea's chief executive at the age of just 39, following the surprise resignation of previous CEO Ron Gourlay. Her glamorous good looks will inevitably draw comparisons with the outspoken, perfectly groomed 'first lady of football' and Apprentice star Karren Brady. But anyone ready to dismiss Ms Granovskaia as merely a pretty face should be aware of a core of steel behind the megawatt smile. Marina Granovskaia has long been one of the most powerful women in football. Now that Chelsea's chief executive Ron Gourlay is leaving the club, she is hotly tipped to be named incoming CEO . The Canadian and Russian national has been hotly tipped to be named incoming Chelsea CEO in a move which will come as little surprise to those who have been following her breathtaking ascent from humble PA to the 'voice of Roman Abramovich'. She has been the most trusted member of the oligarch's inner circle for 17 years and is already often described as 'chief executive in everything but title', his 'eminence grise'. Born in Russia, at school there was little indication of her future as a powerhouse in the footballing world with one former teacher describing her as a 'grey mouse'. 'I remember teaching her, but don't recall anything outstanding about Marina,' said the teacher. 'It's interesting how she has made such a successful career in sport in London.' She studied at a Moscow school which specialised in music and dance, in which there were compulsory lessons, but at the time offered pupils no sport. She graduated six months after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and studied in the Foreign Languages Faculty of Moscow State University before leaving with honours in 1997, and starting her career at Sibneft, the oil company which was then owned by Abramovich,. Since she moved from the Russian capital to London when he bought Chelsea Football Club in 2003, the billionaire is said to have grown to trust her implicitly. Indeed, her position at his right hand is so secure that she often takes his place at meetings, delivers his messages and is said to have the speediest access to him. She is known to be charming and polite, but ruthlessly firm by those who have met her. Just ask Chelsea captain John Terry - who was told in no uncertain terms to 'take it or f****** leave it' when trying to renegotiate his contract with 39-year-old Granovskaia. Granovskaia pictured with chairman Bruce Buck and Ron Gourlay as they watch Jose Mourinho field media questions on his return to manage  Chelsea. She was said to be integral to the decision . Her biggest coup so far has been engineering the return to the club of Jose Mourinho, the Portuguese manager who was dubbed 'The Special One' during his first spell as Chelsea manager between 2004 and 2007. Despite his success, he was sacked after falling out with Abramovich - but Ms Granovskaia apparently kept in constant touch with him, and last year was crucial in sealing the deal to bring him back from Real Madrid. The manoeuvre was typical of her understated style, being just one of a string of delicate negotiations which she has carried out behind the scenes. A source at the club told the Evening Standard: 'She is basically the power at Chelsea. Roman trusts her implicitly. She's not interested in being a celebrity but there is no doubt who's in charge and who call the shots. 'It is symbolic of her role that she was crucial in getting Jose (Mourinho) back. He had fallen out with Roman in very acrimonious and public circumstances and received a massive pay-off. 'It would have been very egg on face for Roman to bring him back even though the fans and players were calling for it. She was the one who said 'let's bring him back' and was the driving force behind the move. And it's paid off big time. While she was key to Mourinho's return it is Ms Granovskaia who is often said to be Abramovich's true 'special one', engineering big-money transfers such as Diego Costa's £32million move from Atletico Madrid and driving  meetings at the Bridge or at the club's training ground in Surrey. She seems happy to pose with players in the rare pictures which can be found of her online. It is perhaps the fact that little is known of Ms Granovskaia that so endears her to the private Abramovich. Sports websites in her native Russia call her 'an absolutely non-public person', adding 'in that sense, she's similar to Abramovich.' Chelsea player Didier Drogba with Granovskaia during the FA Cup Final after Party at Frankies restaurant in Knightsbridge in 2010. She seems happy to pose with players in the rare pictures  found of her online . While outspoken West Ham United vice-chairman Karren Brady proudly touts herself as sporting executive, television broadcaster, newspaper columnist, author and novelist, search for Granovskaia on social media, and all you will find is a fiercely locked down Facebook account, set up in 2007. It tells us that she studied at a Moscow school called 1113, a well regarded establishment dedicated to the arts. She also lists her association with Millhouse Capital, a British holding company set up in 2001 to manage Abramovich's assets. The page also shows that she is a fan of annual Organic & Natural Beauty Show and the restaurant Sumosan - which caters for the VIP boxes at Chelsea. Janina Wolkow and head chef Bubker Belkhit, told The Daily Telegraph last year: 'She's an amazing person. She's so professional, she knows what she wants. Granovskaia has been the most trusted member of the oligarch's inner circle for 17 years and is already often described as 'chief executive in everything but title', his 'eminence grise' on the ground . Her biggest coup so far has been engineering the return to the club of Jose Mourinho, the Portuguese manager who was dubbed 'The Special One' during his first spell as Chelsea manager between 2004 and 2007 . 'She's on top of any small thing to the biggest thing. Any small problem I contact her with, she deals with it on top of everything else she has on her shoulders.' She is fluent in English and speaks several other European languages, and is said to be one of the primary architects behind Chelsea's youth scheme - by taking young talent and sending them on loan to develop. And while Mr Gourlay turned his attention towards the commercial end of the business, Ms Granovskaia became the pivotal figure in transfer and contract negotiations  - a far more familiar face around Stamford Bridge. Agents heading to the Bridge or the club's training ground in Surrey were often met by <s Granovskaia, driving the meetings, increasingly active and influential at the heart of the club with a good relationship with technical director Michael Emenalo. Karren Brady . Before becoming vice-chairman of West Ham United, the London-born businesswoman worked as an advertising account executive for the London Broadcasting Company, where she met current Hammers joint-chairman David Sullivan. Karren Brady has played a key role at Birmingham City and West Ham . Sullivan later employed Brady as managing director at Birmingham City after he bought the club, and the pair were arrested then released on bail as part of the investigation into allegations of corruption in English football in 2006. Sullivan and David Gold subsequently sold the club before purchasing West Ham and making Brady vice-chairman in 2010. Brady was responsible for negotiating West Ham's move to the Olympic Stadium, and has also held executive positions at Channel Four, Kerrang! magazine and Sport England. Heather Rabbatts . Rabbatts became the first woman to be appointed as an FA director in 2011, and notably criticised the FA's commission to improve the national team as being 'all white, all male'. After posts at the BBC, Channel Four and the charity Malaria No More UK, Rabbatt's first football role came in the form of the executive deputy chair at Millwall in 2006. Heather Rabbatt was appointed executive deputy chair at League One side Millwall in 2006 . Gabby Logan . Gabby Logan became the first female presenter of a live football match in the UK and Saturday night institution Match of the Day. Gabby Logan became the first female presenter of a live football match in the UK . The daughter of former Welsh international footballer Terry Yorath, Logan was a promising gymnast in her teens but was forced to retire early due to neurological condition Sciatica. After a spell on local radio in Newcastle after university, she worked for Sky Sports and ITV before moving to the BBC in 2007. Amy Fearn . In 2010, Fearn became the first female to referee in the Football League during Coventry's 1-0 win over Nottingham Forest in the Championship. Amy Fearn became the first female to referee in the Football League . Fearn always wanted to play football as a child, but after growing tired at the lack of playing opportunities, turned her hand to refereeing. She became fully qualified by the age of 14, and after plying her trade in the Midland Football Alliance, gained promotion to the Conference aged 26, despite balancing her officiating duties with her full-time job as an accountant. Elena Pianigiani . Pianigiani, aged 25, is vice-president of Italian fourth division side Poggibonsi. Pianigiani got involved with football at an early age due to her father's involvement with Serie B side Siena - as a 10-year-old she became the mascot of the Tuscan side. Elena Pianigiani was appointed vice-president of Poggibonsi at the age of 21 by her father . Pianigiani was appointed vice-president of Poggibonsi at the age of 21 in 2010 by her father, Antonello Pianigiani, after he purchased 51 per cent of the club two years earlier. Elena said of her father's decision: 'It was unusual because I was only 21. When you're that age, it's usual for a father to give his daughter a new bag, not a football team.'","Marina Granovskaia set to be one of the most powerful women in football .

"Five deputies with the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office in Ohio are under investigation for allegedly sending racist text messages. Two officers, Capt. Thomas Flanders and Detective Michael Sollenberger, have been placed on paid administrative leave while the other three – who are as yet unnamed – remain on the job while the investigation continues. The accusations came to light after an anonymous source passed on hundreds of pages of the messages to the Dayton Unit of the NAACP. Scroll down for video . Capt. Thomas Flanders, left, and Detective Michael Sollenberger, right, have been placed on paid administrative leave from the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office in Ohio during the investigation . The texts, which contain a barrage of racist slurs and insensitive jokes aimed at African-Americans, were exchanged between November 2011 and January 2013 on personal cell phones . After conducted a three-month-long investigation to ensure their authenticity, Derrick Forward - the civil rights organization’s local president - turned the messages over to Sheriff Phil Plumber last week. The texts were exchanged between November 2011 and January 2013 on personal cell phones between the employees during working hours. They contain a barrage of racist slurs and insensitive jokes aimed at African-Americans. One text said, 'I hate N******. That is all.' One  deputy 'joked' to another: 'What do apples and black people have in common? They both hang from trees.' Another read: 'We stopped at a Walmart in Birmingham, there are a lot of Black people in Alabama. It's all Martin Luther Kings fault.' Derrick Forward, the president of the Dayton Unit of the NAACP, was handed records of the texts by an anonymous source and he forwarded them to Sheriff Phil Plumber last week . 'These text messages, while some of them may be some joking going on back and forth, some of them are flat out rude and racist,' Foward told WBTN. He wants the deputies to be sacked immediately if the sheriff’s investigation finds that they sent the messages. Sheriff Plumber said the deputies had 'tarnished the office' by sending the text messages. 'These five individuals have taken this organization three steps backward and will be held accountable,' he said. 'I will not tolerate racism in this department.' Plummer said his investigation is in its early stages, but it was important to public safety that both Flanders and Sollenberger be put on leave. Two African-American deputies were mentioned in the texts, he said. The deputies were in shock they were caught, 'but did not apologize,' Plummer said. The two suspended officers have both been recently promoted. Flanders was a sergeant at the time of the text messages and Sollenberger was a detective under Flanders’ supervision. Flanders had most recently been working as a jail administrator and Sollenberger in Internal Affairs. Captain Tom Flanders, who has been with the office for 19 years, told 2 NEWS that the allegations are completely false. He denied being racist and said he looked forward to clearing his name. The NAACP is requesting that an outside agency perform an investigation also.

"The Fukushima site, the scene of the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl, has become a tourist attraction. Local government tour guides are now escorting buses of people through the area, explaining what has become of the disaster zone. Back in 2011, three of the Fukushima Nuclear Plant's six reactors blew up following a tsunami, releasing radioactive gases that meant the whole area had to be evacuated. Fukushima Prefecture has been abandoned since the nuclear blow-up back in 2011 . Locals hope opening the area up as a tourist attraction can stimulate a mass rebuild . However, with contamination levels said to be 'low', people are being permitted on whistle-stop tours to view the desolate and abandoned place. Although there were no fatalities from radiation exposure, 300,000 residents were moved from a 20-mile radius of the nuclear plant. In total there were nearly 16,000 deaths reported from the natural disaster and subsequent devastation. Three of the six reactors blew up when a tsunami measuring 9 on the Richter scale hit the region. Clean-up expected to take decades, and cost more than £18 billion. An investigation panel deduced the disaster had major elements of being 'man-made,' and there was a ''culture of complacency about nuclear safety and poor crisis management.' When asked what people say when they see the area for the first time, tour organiser Yusuke Kato told CNN: 'At first, they say unbelievable.' With soil and water contaminated, nobody can live there yet, and it is unknown when the clean-up mission will be completed. Former residents like Kenichi Bamba are optimistic that Fukushima Prefecture can be rebuilt, but the pain of what happened is still raw. 'Actually I've come here several times but still… I cannot say anything. Just sad. Just sad.' The nuclear plant is still being taken apart, and it is estimated it will take decades to make the area safe, as well as cost billions of pounds. Surveys show only a fifth of former residents want to return to living in the area. However, tour guides hope by educating tourists and sharing their experiences of what Fukushima once was, people can be inspired and help rebuild the prefecture. Kato added: 'We want to encourage local people for the revitilisation of Fukushima.' Contamination levels are low, which means people can, for a limited time, view the destruction site . A tsunami led to a terrible chain of events that still sees Fukushima uninhabitable to this day . The plant has six reactors, three of which were offline when disaster struck on March 11, 2011. A magnitude-9.0 earthquake triggered a huge tsunami which swept into the plant and knocked out its backup power and cooling systems, leading to meltdowns at the three active reactors. Decommissioning and dismantling all six reactors is a delicate, time-consuming process that includes removing the melted fuel from a highly radioactive environment, as well as all the extra fuel rods, which sit in cooling pools at the top of the reactor buildings. Workers, who wear protective suits when dismantling the plant, must determine the exact condition of the melted fuel debris and develop remote-controlled and radiation-resistant robotics to deal with it. The process is expected to take at least 40 years.","Fukushima Prefecture decimated by nuclear disaster back in 2011 .

"The buildings of a resort designed to the boost morale of hardworking Nazis are to go on sale at cut price. The construction, known as Prora, on  Rügen, Germany's largest island, was part of a programme introduced by Hitler, called Kraft durch Freude - meaning 'strength through joy'. As part of the programme, the Nazi leader organized activities such as skiing and cruises - and intended to build a collection of seaside resorts on Rügen. A promotional poster hangs on the buildings of the former seaside resort in Prora on the island of Rügen . Iinitial construction started in 1936, but had to be halted at the onslaught of World War II. Over the next three years, a total of 10,000 rooms were built. The resort was designed to include eight identical buildings, offering entertainment, catered meals and organised fun based around Nazi propaganda and won an award in 1937 for its Bauhaus design. Once war broke out in 1939, the Nazis used the buildings to house workers and provide shelter to refugees, and post-war, they were used to house Soviet and East German military. But over time they fell into disrepair and were only saved from demolition thanks to being given a landmark status. The sombre grey block was seen as an example of Third Reich architecture, along with the Nazi party rally grounds in Nuremberg and Berlin's Olympic Stadium. A sign points to the showroom at the construction. Eight bed houses with a total of 10,000 rooms were built from 1935 to 1939 . After the  property was sold to private investors, the first apartments, condos and apartments were built . The property was sold to private investors and is finally set to realise its purpose as a mega resort, renting and selling holidays homes and condos. Estate agent, IRIS GERD, who are redeveloping Prora's building Block I, is offering some 'New Prora' units at prices between 200,000 and 250,000 euros - around £160k and £200k. Investors believe that despite its history, with the property market on a steep incline in Germany, the holiday homes will sell. One estate agent, Kathrin Lange, told German press, the buildings are for 'risk-tolerant investors'.","Resort designed to boost Nazi morale to offer holiday rentals and condos .

"My initial impression of Sri Lanka? Hot. I first visited in 1982 – when England played their first test match against Sri Lanka in Colombo. Then we went and played in Kandy, in the central province, and it has become one of my favourite places in the whole country. It’s home to the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), and is the most important spot for Sri Lanka’s Buddhist community. The whole town is steeped in history. It’s always been one of the country’s major trading places, and there are beautiful temples and tea plantations. It must be part of your itinerary. A family favourite: Ian Botham has spent time with his grandchildren in Sri Lanka - and has long found Kandy (right), where the Temple of the Tooth Relic is an important Buddhist landmark - to be one of its greatest cities . I only really started to fall in love with the country on coming back to commentate. As a player we were never in one place long enough. I visited the south at the start of 2004, just after the tsunami. It was horrendous, with bodies still being pulled from the rubble. Since then, Laureus Sport for Good Foundation (I’m an ambassador for the organisation) has worked with the Sri Lanka-based Foundation of Goodness and built the Southern Project in Seenigama, an area which was devastated by the huge wave. There’s a brand new school, a cricket oval and an Olympic-sized pool. The pool was paid for by rock singer Bryan Adams, who offered to help fund the sports complex after reading about the destruction wreaked by the tsunami, and locals have named it the Bryan Adams Pool in his honour. It’s hard to believe that when I first visited, the railway line - and a train - were 400 yards away in a coconut tree. It was this project which inspired me to undertake last year’s sponsored walk. I managed 160 miles, from the north to the south of the island, in eight days. The aim was to raise money and mirror what’s been done in the south - because the north was devastated by the civil war and has suffered terribly. The north has so much to offer - it’s Sri Lanka’s next booming tourism centre. The main draw are the beaches – they’re sensational. There are new hotels and railways being built and the airport at Jaffna, the capital city of the northern province, is being renovated. It should establish itself within five years. Anuradhapura - the capital of the north central province - and Mihintale, which is the birthplace of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, have beautiful stupas and temples which put Angkor Wat to shame - well, almost. They are within what’s known as Sri Lanka’s cultural triangle. Splendid: The south coast of Sri Lanka has glorious beaches - and has recovered from the tsunami of 2004 . This area’s most spectacular landmark is the Sigiriya rock fortress - an enormous, 200-metre-high lump of stone. In 480 AD, a Sri Lankan king built his castle atop the rock. It’s a UNESCO World Heritage site and Sri Lankans call it the eighth wonder of the world. I climbed it on my first cricket tour and was amazed. So much that, while taking a photo, I accidentally knocked over the bottle of water I’d diligently carried to the top. I remember watching in horror as it rolled over the edge and tumbled out of sight. I’ve visited Sri Lanka with my family several times. Some of the most memorable trips have been with my wife and the grandchildren. It’s incredibly child-friendly - as child-friendly as destinations like Spain or the Caribbean. We wanted to show the grandchildren that life isn’t easy, that terrible things happen but you have to pick yourself up, dust yourself off and carry on. The Sri Lankans are the best example of this - they’re always smiling and there’s no bitterness about the unfair hand they’ve been dealt, with the civil war and tsunami. They are the reason my wife Kath and I keep returning. We’ve spent a lot of time in the capital, Colombo, which is a fantastic, progressive city, with great hotels and restaurants. We like Lagoon, the restaurant at the Cinnamon Grand hotel, where you choose your seafood from a huge display and the chefs cook it however you want. The grandchildren loved it - they would compete to find the biggest fish. Other great restaurants in the capital are the Ministry of Crab, which is owned by Sri Lankan cricketers Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene, and the Park Street Mews restaurant, which blends Sri Lankan and European cuisine. I’ve probably spent most time in the south, in coastal towns like Galle and Weligama. In Weligama, we rented a villa and just chill out - I love watching the stilt fishermen balancing on their poles. Inviting: Kandy, at the very heart of this tropical island, is Sri Lanka at its most intriguing . I’ve spent hours walking around Galle fort, which is a walled city. The locals have incredible stories to tell about the day the tsunami hit - how they could see the wave coming and ran inside the fort, emerging hours later to find the rest of the city in ruins. The fort was built by the Portuguese in the 14th century and it split the wave and saved thousands of lives. Nobody inside died - you can walk around inside and see these old shops and restaurants which weren’t even affected. The grandchildren also adored Weligama, where they fished, rode in tuk-tuks, played on the beaches and spotted turtles. One day was spent just fishing on the beach. One of my grandchildren, James, is extremely competitive - he simply has to beat his younger sister at everything. James had spent all day waiting for a bite. He put down the rod while he nipped to the loo and his sister Imani-Jayne picked up the rod and caught a fish within seconds. James was livid. My advice for anyone considering a visit to Sri Lanka? Do it. It is all there to be explored. Tourism on the south coast is well-established. The east and west coasts are becoming more established, and the north will soon be the next big tourism destination. What’s more, you don’t have to walk everywhere - like I did.

"Scotland's mountain resorts have more snow than parts of the Alps and Sochi, but skiers are being advised not to take on the slopes because of the risk of avalanches. The Ski Club of Great Britain has reported depths of 285cm at Glencoe Mountain, 250cm at Cairngorm Mountain and 200cm at Nevis Range. This comes after they reported a depth of only 128cm at Whistler in Canada, the host of the 2010 Winter Olympics, a few days ago. Avalanche risk: Staff at Glencoe Mountain Resort worked in sub-zero temperatures to clear the 14ft snow drifts . Depth: The huge amounts o snow virtually engulfed lifts on the slopes. Mountain Rescue have said there is an extremely high risk of avalanches . Massive snow drifts in the Scottish mountains have also caused more avalanches already than the the entirety of last winter. The SportScotland Avalanche Information Service said the risk in Lochaber was 'high' while the other four mountain areas the threat was 'considerable.' A spokesman from Lochaber SAIS said: 'Further deposits of fresh unstable windslab will continue to build on the existing deep accumulations lying in sheltered areas, mainly on North through East to South-East aspects above 850 metres where avalanches will occur. 'Unstable windslab will also be present on other aspects. Cornices will be unstable and prone to collapse. The avalanche hazard will be High.' The huge snowfalls have led to safety warnings being imposed by mountain rescue. Covered: The slopes in Scotland had more snow than some European and North American ski resorts, and boasted bigger depths than the runs in Sochi . Taking advantage: Some skiers and snowboarders ignored the avalanche warnings at Glenshee ski centre . Scots keen to take advantage of the conditions queue up for the lifts in Glenshee . There have been 159 avalanches in the Scottish mountains so far this winter - 80 in the last month alone - and 30 more than last season, with many more weeks of the season left. The number of fatalities caused by avalanches during the 2012-13 season was the highest in years.In all, eight people were killed in avalanches on Scottish mountains last winter. Nineteen of the 129 avalanches recorded last winter were triggered by human activity. Heavy snowfalls, freezing temperatures and powerful winds have also created spectacular, and some potentially dangerous, conditions on Scottish hills and mountains. Cornices, edges of snow overhanging high crags, are a common feature - and risk - of most winters. However, this season's frequent strong winds coupled with big dumps of snow have seen some larger than usual cornices in ranges such as the Northern Cairngorms. A path dug by one of the workers shows how the ski lift system was buried under the blanket of snow .","The Ski Club of Great Britain said there's depths of 285cm at Glencoe .

Among the weapons listed in the report were the advanced Patriot missile system, the Navy's Aegis ballistic missile defense systems, the F/A-18 fighter jet, the V-22 Osprey, the Black Hawk helicopter and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The report did not specify the extent or time of the cyber-thefts or indicate if they involved computer networks of the U.S. government, contractors or subcontractors. But the espionage would give China knowledge that could be exploited in a conflict, such as knocking out communications and corrupting data, the Post said. It also could speed Beijing's development of Chinese defense technology. Chinese hackers stole plans for confidential United States weapons systems including the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter pictured here . In a report to Congress earlier this month, the Pentagon said China was using espionage to modernize its military and that its hacking was a serious concern. It said the U.S. government had been the target of hacking that appeared to be 'attributable directly to the Chinese government and military'. China has dismissed as groundless . both the Pentagon report and a February report by the U.S. computer . security company Mandiant, which said a secretive Chinese military unit . was probably behind a series of hacking attacks targeting the United . States that had stolen data from 100 companies. Meanwhile, news reports in Australia . claim hackers linked to China stole the floorplans of the $630 million . headquarters for the Australia Security Intelligence Organisation, the . country's domestic spy agency. 'Compromised': A V-22 Osprey pictured here is among the aircrafts for which plans were stolen . The attack through the computers of a construction contractor exposed not only building layouts, but also the location of communication and computer networks. Australia security analyst Des Ball told the ABC in the report that such information made the yet to be completed spy headquarters vulnerable to future cyber attacks. 'You can start constructing your own wiring diagrams, where the linkages are through telephone connections, through wi-fi connections, which rooms are likely to be the ones that are used for sensitive conversations, how to surreptitiously put devices into the walls of those rooms,' said Ball. The building is designed to be part of a global electronic intelligence gathering network which includes the United States and the UK, but its construction has been plagued by delays and cost blowouts, with some builders blaming late design changes on cyber attacks. The ABC report said the Chinese . hacking was part of a growing wave of cyber attacks against business and . military targets in the close U.S. ally. It . said the hackers also stole confidential information from the . Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which houses the overseas spy . agency the Australian Secret Intelligence Service and had targeted local . companies, including steel-manufacturer Bluescope Steel, and military . and civilian communications manufacturer Codan Ltd. Chinese hackers allegedly associated with the country's government stole United States missile plans for weapons such as Patriot missile batteries (pictured here) The influential Greens party said the hacking was a 'security blunder of epic proportions' and called for an inquiry, but the government refused to confirm the breach. Prime Minister Julia Gillard said the reports were 'inaccurate', but declined to say how. Australian officials, like those in the United States and other Western nations, have made cyber attacks a security priority following a growing number of attacks of the resource rich country, mostly blamed on China. Despite being one of Beijing's major trade partners, the country is seen by China as the southern fulcrum of the U.S. military pivot to the Asia-Pacific and in 2011 agreed to host thousands of U.S. Marines in near-permanent rotation. Australia is a major buyer for U.S. weapons systems and is one of the largest overseas customers for the . Lockheed Martin manufactured F-35, as well as for Boeing's F/A-18 Super . Hornet and associated weapons systems. Chinese . telecommunications giant Huawei was last year barred from bidding for . construction contracts on a new Australian high-speed broadband network . amid fears of cyber espionage. Hacked: The New York Times office in Manhattan. The newspaper has reported that its computer system was breached by Chinese hackers . The Reserve Bank of Australia said in March that it had been targeted by cyber attacks, but no data had been lost or systems compromised amid reports the hackers had tried to access intelligence on Group of 20 wealthy nations negotiations. China has dismissed the allegations by Australian media that Chinese hackers have stolen the blueprints for the new Australian spy headquarters. Foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei said: 'China pays high attention to cybersecurity issues, and is firmly apposed to all forms of hacker attacks. Groundless accusations will not help solve this issue.' The risk of cyber hacking came to the forefront of the news agenda after Chinese hackers were accused of being responsible for hacking The Washington Post and The New York Times earlier this year. And . just last month, hacking attacks on the servers of South Korean . broadcasters and banks originated from an IP address based in China. But . China says it is impossible to tell the true origin of cyber-attacks, . and accuses hostile forces of blaming it out of prejudice or a desire to . put Beijing on the defensive.

"France is the most popular ski destination for Brits this winter accounting for a staggering 87 per cent of all enquiries. Austria and Switzerland remain popular, although demand for both is down on last year while Andorra has seen a significant hike in popularity with enquiries up 32 per cent on last season. Morzine is the number one choice for Brits and demand for this resort is up 16 per cent on last year, in research by Owners Direct. Morzine in France will be the most popular ski resort for Brits when booking a winter trip . Val Thorens, Meribel and La Plagne have also experienced a big leap in demand versus last season, whereas Chamonix has seen demand fall by 23 per cent and it has dropped from position four to position nine in the 'top 10'.

Top 10 most popular ski resorts, based on number of enquiries received between January and October 2014 for travel between December 2014 and March 2015, compared with the same period in the previous year . Figures from the holiday home specialist and currency provider, Caxton FX, have revealed that demand for ski holidays is climbing high, reporting that the volume of currency purchased for ski-related trips is up 59 per cent on last year. 'British skiers are opting for the more affordable eurozone resorts, over the US and Switzerland, with the number of US dollars purchased for ski this year down on 2013,' said James Hickman, managing director of Caxton FX. Figures for US Dollars are reportedly down 73 per cent on last year and the number of Swiss Francs bought this year is down 58 per cent since 2012. 'In contrast, the volume of Euros purchased for ski-related trips is up 64 per cent, year on year. Brits really are making the most of being closer to home where the pound has significantly strengthened against the Euro, adds Mr Hickman.' Chamonix has fallen from position four to nine and a 23 per cent drop in bookings for 2015 . Owners Direct is putting the heightened demand for snowy escapes down to the balmy temperatures that the UK has enjoyed this year, particularly during the hazy autumn, which has made holidaymakers crave the crisp chill of the slopes even more than usual. Its figures have also revealed that December is the most popular month for travellers to take a ski holiday, accounting for almost half of the total enquiries for the 2014/15 season, followed by February4, with many opting to take their ski break during the school holidays. 'Holiday homes are particularly appealing for families, whose travel dates are often restricted to the Christmas and February half-term school holidays, because they offer a more affordable way to enjoy a ski holiday than a hotel or catered chalet and allow the whole family to stay together,' added Ms Chang. Owners Direct has more than 3,400 ski properties to rent this season, spanning France, Austria, Switzerland, Bulgaria, Andorra, Italy and Finland.","Staggering 87% will book a ski trip to France this winter .

"While 70 million deaf people use sign language as their mother tongue, not everyone has knowledge of the language so communicating can still be challenging. Now a team of entrepreneurs who are all deaf have come up with a tablet case called Uni that can translate sign language into text that is shown on a tablet, to bridge the gap between deaf people and those who can hear. They describe it as a ‘revolutionary two-way communication tool for the deaf and hearing.’ Scroll down for video .

"The FA has given Wigan chairman Dave Whelan an extra week to respond to his misconduct charge. The 78-year-old last month allegedly made remarks about Chinese and Jewish people in response to criticism of the club's decision to appoint Malky Mackay as the Latics' new manager. Whelan publicly apologised for the comments attributed to him in the Guardian and also suggested he may have been misquoted, yet was still charged by football's governing body. Dave Whelan, seen crying as Wigan fans sang his name before they faced Middlesbrough last Saturday, has been charged by the Football Association for alleged racist remarks made to the press . Whelan pictured in 2013 with the FA Cup after Wigan stunned Manchester City at Wembley to win the trophy . The Wigan owner had until 6pm on Friday to respond to the charge, but the FA has now granted him a week's extension.

'The Wigan Athletic chairman now has until 6pm on Friday 12 December 2014 to respond to the charge.' The Guardian reported that Whelan said 'Jewish people do chase money more than everybody else' and, when asked about Mackay's past indiscretions, replied by saying it was 'nothing' to call a Chinese person a 'chink'. Whelan publicly apologised for the comments attributed to him in the Guardian . The Wigan Athletic chairman (right) now has until 6pm on Friday, December 12 to respond .

"Two women have been charged with animal cruelty, one month after a raid on a suburban Buffalo, New York, kennel. Authorities found dozens of animals at the Dodge Boarding Kennel living in deplorable conditions - and nearly as many dead ones stored in freezers at the Getzville facility. Maria Faricellie, 53, and Sheila Meli, 49, were each charged with five counts of animal cruelty. Faricellie owns the kennel and Meli ran the facility. Scroll down for video . Authorities found dozens of animals at the Dodge Boarding Kennel living in deplorable conditions - and nearly as many dead ones stored in freezers at the Getzville facility . Gruesome: 72 dead animals were found in freezers - some of which were raccoons, rabbits, sugar gliders, guinea pigs and turtles - the SPCA said.  A rescued cat is seen being led away during the raid . The five counts come from the number of animal species discovered at the time of the November 7 kennel raid: cats, dogs, reptiles, birds and small exotics. The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) said it removed 77 live animals and amphibians from the facility. The SPCA said  it also discovered 72 dead animals in freezers, some of which were raccoons, rabbits, sugar gliders, guinea pigs and turtles. WIVB reported last month that the animals were in bags with labels on them. Officials said many of the cats and dogs were malnourished and had matted hair. A turtle showed 'shell rot', and there was a 'severely underweight chinchilla,' the SPCA said. The animal's overgrown teeth may have hindered its ability to eat. The SPCA said the raid took place after officials earlier went to the property on October 27, October 28 and November 4 and observed poor conditions, including the smell of urine.

"Omar al-Shishani, one of hundreds of Chechens who have been among the toughest jihadi fighters in Syria, has emerged as the face of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, appearing frequently in its online videos . A young, red bearded Chechen who has rapidly become one of the most prominent commanders of Isis may have risen to become the extremist group's overall military chief, it has been claimed. Omar al-Shishani, one of hundreds of Chechens who have been among the toughest jihadi fighters in Syria, has emerged as the face of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, appearing frequently in its online videos. His appearances in the videos are in contrast to the group's Iraqi leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who remains deep in hiding and has hardly ever been photographed. Al-Shishani has been the group's military . commander in Syria, leading it on an offensive to take over a broad . stretch of territory leading to the Iraq border. But he may have risen to become the . group's overall military chief, a post that has been vacant after the . Iraqi militant who once held it - known as Abu Abdul-Rahman al-Bilawi . al-Anbari - was killed in the Iraqi city of Mosul in early June. In a video released by the group over the weekend, al-Shishani is shown standing next to the group's spokesman among a group of fighters as they declare the elimination of the border between Iraq and Syria. The video was released just hours before the extremist group announced the creation of a caliphate - or Islamic state - in the areas it controls. 'Our aim is clear and everyone knows why we are fighting. Our path is toward the caliphate,' the 28-year-old al-Shishani declares. 'We will bring back the caliphate, and if God does not make it our fate to restore the caliphate, then we ask him to grant us martyrdom.' The video is consistent with other Associated Press reporting on al-Shishani. The video identified al-Shishani as 'the military commander' without specifying its Syria branch, suggesting he had been elevated to overall commander. The group however has not formally announced such a promotion. In a video released by the group over the weekend, al-Shishani is shown standing next to the group's spokesman among a group of fighters as they declare the elimination of the border between Iraq and Syria . Al-Shishani, whose real name is Tarkhan Batirashvili, is an ethnic Chechen from the Caucasus nation of Georgia . Charles Lister, visiting fellow with the Brookings Doha Centre, told Associated Press that as the militant group's operations in . Iraq and Syria grow 'more and more inter-dependent by the day, it is . more than possible that someone like (al-Shishani) could assume overall . military leadership.' Two days after the group unilaterally declared the establishment of a caliphate, the group's leader, al-Baghdadi, appeared on a 19-minute audiotape calling on Muslims to come to the territory his group has seized to help build an Islamic state. In the audio, posted yesterday on militant websites which have been used by the group before, the leader makes a special call to those with practical skills - such as scholars, judges, doctors, engineers and people with military and administrative expertise - to come 'answer the dire need of the Muslims for them'. He also calls on jihadi fighters to increase fighting in the holy month of Ramadan, which began on Sunday. He said: 'In this virtuous month or in any other month, there is no deed better than jihad in the path of Allah, so take advantage of this opportunity and walk the path of you righteous predecessors. 'So to arms, to arms, soldiers of the Islamic, fight, fight.' The extremist group began as al-Qaida's branch in Iraq, and many of its top leaders are Iraqi. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, head of the Islamic State or Iraq and the Levant, yesterday appeared on a 19-minute audiotape calling on Muslims to come to the territory his group has seized to help build an Islamic state . It drew hundreds of foreign fighters to its operations in Syria however after it intervened in Syria's civil war last year. The two branches are now swapping fighters, equipment and weapons to an even greater extent than before, becoming a more integrated organization. Its declaration of the caliphate - aspiring to be a state for all Muslims - could mean an even greater internationalization of its ranks. Alexei Malashenko, an expert with the Carnegie Endowment's Moscow office, said ethnicity is not a major factor in jihadi movements, only dedication to jihad. Al-Shishani 'is a fanatic of Islam with war experience, and he obviously has had a strong track record (among fellow fighters),' he said. Announcement: Isis militants celebrate the establishment of a caliphate, or Islamic state, in the vast stretches of the Middle East that have fallen under its control . Militant Islamist fighters take part in a military parade along the streets of Syria's northern Raqqa province to celebrate their declaration of an Islamic 'caliphate' after the group captured territory in neighbouring Iraq . Syria's civil war, in its fourth year, has attracted militants from around the world. Some estimates run as high as 10,000 foreign fighters in the country. But the Chechens - hardened from years of wars with Russia in the Caucasus region - are considered some of the best fighters. Alexander Bortnikov, the head of Russia's Federal Security Service, the main KGB successor agency known under its Russian acronym FSB, said last October that about 500 militants from Russia and hundreds more from other ex-Soviet nations are fighting in Syria. Al-Shishani, whose real name is Tarkhan Batirashvili, is an ethnic Chechen from the Caucasus nation of Georgia, specifically from the Pankisi Valley, a centre of Georgia's Chechen community and once a stronghold for militants. He carried out military service in the Georgian army but was discharged after an unspecified illness, said one of his former neighbours, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. A gun-brandishing Islamist loyal to Isis celebrates the formation of the caliphate by waving a jihadist flag in the Syrian city of Raqqa on Sunday . At one point, he was arrested by Georgian police for illegal possession of arms, the neighbour told Associated Press. As soon as he was released in 2010, Batirashvili left for Turkey. Georgian police refused to comment. He later surfaced in Syria in 2013 with his nom de guerre, which means 'Omar the Chechen' in Arabic, leading an al-Qaida-inspired group called 'The Army of Emigrants and Partisans,' which included a large number of fighters from the former Soviet Union. A meeting was soon organized with al-Baghdadi in which al-Shishani pledged loyalty to him, according to Lebanon's al-Akhbar newspaper, which follows jihadi groups. As the militant group's operations in . Iraq and Syria grow 'more and more inter-dependent by the day, it is . more than possible that someone like (al-Shishani) could assume overall . military leadership' - Charles Lister, visiting fellow with the Brookings Doha Centre . In August 2013 his fighters proved pivotal in taking the Syrian military's Managh air base in the north of the country. Rebels had been trying for months to take the base, but it fell soon after al-Shishani joined the battle, said an activist from the region, Abu al-Hassan Maraee. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant entered the Syria conflict in 2013, and initially it was welcomed by other rebels. But rebel groups - including other Islamic militant factions - turned against it, alienated by its brutal methods and kidnappings and killings of rivals, and accusing it of trying to take over the opposition movement for its own ambitions of creating a transnational Islamic enclave. Rebel factions have been fighting against the group since last year in battles that have left thousands dead. Al-Qaida's central command ejected the extremist group from the network. For the past two months, al-Shishani has led an offensive in Syria's eastern Deir el-Zour province against rival rebels, seeking to solidify his hold on a stretch of territory connected to neighboring Iraq. In May, some Arab media organizations reported that al-Shishani was killed in the fighting. An activist in Iraq in contact with members of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant said al-Shishani suffered wounds in his right arm and was taken into Iraq where he underwent treatment before returning to Syria. He spoke on condition of anonymity for security concerns. Caliphate: A map purportedly showing the areas Isis plans to have under its control within five years has been widely shared online. As well as the Middle East, North Africa and large areas of Asia, it also reveals Isis' ambition to extend into Europe. Spain, which was Muslim-ruled until the late 15th Century, would form part of the caliphate, as would the Balkan states and eastern Europe, up to and including Austria . Since then, al-Shishani has appeared multiple times in photos and videos put out by the group. The photos and videos are consistent with the AP's reporting from activists on the ground. In a recent photograph, the young, round-faced al-Shishani, wearing a black cap and beige gown, is seen with a big smile as he examines a Humvee said to have been captured in Iraq and brought into Syria. Hussein Nasser, spokesman for the Islamic Front coalition group of rebels, said Chechens are among the most feared fighters in Syria. 'A Chechen comes and has no idea about anything (in the country) and does whatever his leader tells him,' Nasser said. 'Even if his emir tells him to kill a child, he would do it.'","Omar al-Shishani has emerged as face of Isis after appearing in online videos .

"At first glance, it looks uncannily like a human brain. However, in fact this could be proof of the volcanoes that once flowed across the Marian surface. The huge circular area is nearly 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) wide, and is described as a 'circular island' by Nasa. Scroll down for video . The huge circular area spotted by Nasa is nearly 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) wide, and is in the Athabasca region of the red planet . The Athabasca Valles is an outflow channel on Mars, cut into its surface by catastrophic flooding. The very high spatial resolution images from the HiRISE camera on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter have revealed that all the flood features are draped by lava flows. This flow, near Athabasca Valles, could be the youngest lava flow on Mars. 'It looks like a circular island surrounded by a 'sea' of smooth-looking lava flows,' Nasa said. The Athabasca region where the unique shape was spotted contains some of the youngest lava flows on Mars. 'Therefore, it is highly possible that volcanism played a role in creating this feature,' Nasa's experts claim. 'Perhaps lava has intruded underneath this mound and pushed it up from beneath. 'It looks as if material is missing from the mound, so it is also possible that there was a significant amount of ice in the mound that was driven out by the heat of the lava. There are an array of features like this in the region that continue to puzzle scientists. 'We hope that close inspection of this HiRISE image, and others around it, will provide some clues regarding its formation,' they say.

HiRISE is one of six instruments on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The 65 kg (143 lb), $40 million instrument was built under the direction of the University of Arizona's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory by Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. It consists of a 0.5 m (19.7 in) aperture reflecting telescope, the largest so far of any deep space mission, which allows it to take pictures of Mars with resolutions of 0.3 m/pixel (about 1 foot), resolving objects below a meter across. Research published in January 2010, described the discovery of a vast single lava flow, the size of the state of Oregon, that 'was put in place turbulently over the span of several weeks at most.' The Athabasca region where the unique shape was spotted contains some of the youngest lava flows on Mars . This flow, near Athabasca Valles, is the youngest lava flow on Mars. It is thought to be of Late Amazonian Age. The floor of Athabasca Valles is peppered with thousands of small cones and rings formed as steam exploded through the lava flow. Because the flood-carved surface is now covered by lava, it is no longer easy to determine the age of the water floods that passed through Athabasca Valles. It is plausible that the flood was triggered by rising magma. Around 80% of the craters in Athabasca Valles are secondary craters from the impact that created Zunil crater.","Circular feature is nearly 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) wide on the Athabasca region of the red planet .
Experts say it is most likely to be a circular island surrounded by a 'sea' of smooth-looking lava flows .

"More embarrassing details about Sony are coming to light a week after a group with ties to North Korea hacked the production company's internal servers and released hundreds of documents ranging from never-released movies to employee evaluations. Hidden among the documents never meant to be seen by the public include the budget for upcoming film The Interview, starring Seth Rogen and James Franco as a TV producer and talk show host recruited by the CIA to assassinate North Korean President Kim Jong-un. The leaked records show Rogen, who also directed and wrote the script, was paid $8.4million for the film, compared to co-star James Franco who made $6.5million.  The budget also revealed a pretty important plot point: that Britney Spears' ex-husband Kevin Federline makes a cameo, for which he was paid $5,000. Scroll down for video . Paydays: Seth Rogen took home $8.4million working on The Interview, compared to the $6.5million his co-star James Franco made (left), according to information revealed in the recent cyber attack on Sony . Responsible? Sources close to the internal investigation of the hack at Sony say they believe a North Korean group is behind the attack. Officials in North Korea previously threatened action . Compared to A-list actors like Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert Downey Jr and Jennifer Lawrence, who can take home more than $20million per film, the salaries revealed in the hack show the Rogen and Franco took home relatively average to low pay. Overall the film cost $44million for Sony to make. Meanwhile, Michael Lynton, the CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment and Amy Pascal, the co-chairman of the company were both revealed to be making a $3million annual salary. Among the more entertaining details revealed in the budget were how much the production company paid for small items like props. Millionaires: Sony Pictures Entertainment Co-Chairman Amy Pascal (left) and Sony Pictures CEO Michael Lynton (right) both make $3million a year, according to the leaked documents . One part of the script calls for a 'table of weed, coke, pills and panties' which was budgeted at $250. Thanks to some thrifty production assistants, the cost was brought down to $241. The hackers also uploaded five yet-to-be-released films to file-sharing websites, including the Brad Pitt film Fury, still in theaters, and Annie, the much-anticipated remake set for a December 19 release. The company has been trying to take the videos off the internet with cease-and-desist orders. Pay information for more than 31,000 employees at Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Ltd, a financial firm hired by Sony, were taken in the hack as well. The pay information from 2005 revealed that there are far more men than women with high-paying salaries. The list was leaked to a reporter at news and pop culture site Fusion. Kevin Roose, reporting for Fusion, who was sent a link to the data by an anonymous source, said: 'When I sorted the list by 'annual rate,' I noticed something notable: a stark homogeneity among the people earning the most. 'Based on the spreadsheet ... the employees of Sony Pictures with the highest annual rates appear to be nearly entirely white men.' Buzzfeed reviewed almost 40GB of leaked internal data and reported it included 'employee criminal background checks, salary negotiations, and doctors' letters explaining the medical rationale for leaves of absence.' It reported the files also included a script for an unreleased pilot written by Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan as well as 'email exchanges with employees regarding specific medical treatments they are undergoing, while one disciplinary letter details a manager's romantic relationship and business travel history with a subordinate.' The leaked information even includes an email about the breastfeeding diet of a senior executive. One aspect of the leak, which probably has the Sony IT team reeling, is the several spreadsheet and text documents where employees stored their passwords...under the name 'password'. And then there's the hilarious slideshow written by Sony CFO David Hendler, negatively reviewing the company's own films. In one slide, he draws attention to the movies the company put out in 2005, the worst year in the company's history. Those films include Zorro, Bewitched and Zathura. Hendler follows that up with a slide about the movies distributed in 2010 like Burlesque, How Do You Know and Just Go With It, commenting: 'Not as bad as 2005, but still not something to write home about'. Those on Sony's marketing teams devised equally entertaining slides, revealed in the breach. A few of the slides take different movies, and explain the concept, and strengths and weaknesses to highlight. For movies with a patriotic element, like White House Down and Captain Phillips, executives warn to 'avoid American-centrism' and focus instead on special effects and star actors. Presentation: In this leaked slideshow, Sony CFO David Hendler calls out the movies that made for the company's worst financial year on record . Critic: He follows the 2005 slide up with the movies distributed in 2010, commenting: 'Not as bad as 2005, but still not something to write home about' Company secrets: Another leaked slideshow shows how the company tries to downplay American themes in films with a patriotic theme . The hack is thought to be carried out by those allied with the North Korean regime, unhappy with the country's portrayal in the film. In June, a North Korean official appeared on the state-run news station to say the country would pursue 'a strong and merciless countermeasure' if Sony released the film. Despite the threat, Sony has continued to roll out promotion for the movie ahead of it's December 25 release date. Exactly one month before it was set to be released, Sony confirmed that the company had been hacked, and that the mysterious group behind the cyber attack released hundreds of company documents online. The day before, an alleged warning posted to Reddit read: 'This is just the beginning'. Sony has yet to officially name North Korea as the source of the cyber attack, but sources close to the internal investigation spoke out on Wednesday to say they believe a group known as DarkSeoul is to blame. Cars enter Sony Pictures Entertainment headquarters in Culver City, California. The company is still conducting an internal investigation on the hack . The group associated with North Korea was thought to be behind the large-scale March 2013 attack on South Korean banks and broadcasters. Other evidence from the hack points to the regime, including Korean-language coding, in similarities to other attacks by DarkSeoul. The results of the internal investigation into the attack, currently being carried out by FireEye's Mandiant forensics unit, are expected to be announced later this week. Earlier this week, a North Korean spokesperson refused to deny claims that it was behind the move and would only say 'wait and see' when asked if Pyongyang was involved. Staff at Sony are growing increasingly disgruntled about the never-ending slew of Adam Sandler movies the company is producing . Staff at Sony are growing increasingly disgruntled about the never-ending slew of Adam Sandler movies the company is producing, according to information released following last week’s cyber attack. An un-encrypted text file titled ‘Sony_2012_Comments’ has been released which features a long list of negative employee feedback – and Sandler’s name is a reoccurring theme. The comedian’s company, Happy Madison Productions, has been responsible for 25 films released by Sony over the past 15 years including Click, I Now Pronounce You Chuck And Larry, You Don’t Mess With The Zohan, Grown Ups and 50 First Dates. These movies turn a profit but are shown little love from the critics and from Sony staff it would appear. Here are some of the comments featured in the leaked document: . Other criticism from staff was equally as cutting even if the target wasn't quite so specific: . Sandler movies such as I Now Pronounce You Chuck And Larry regularly turn a profit for Sony but rarely win over the critics or staff a leaked memo has revealed . 'The hostile forces are relating everything to the DPRK (North Korea). I kindly advise you to just wait and see,' a spokesman for North Korea's U.N. mission. North Korea routinely refers to the United States and South Korea as hostile forces. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation is also investigating the incident. North Korea complained to the United Nations in June about The Interview, accusing the United States of sponsoring terrorism and committing an act of war by allowing production of the movie. The Pyongyang government denounced the film as 'undisguised sponsoring of terrorism, as well as an act of war' in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. 'I personally don't care if (the movie's) disrespectful to Kim because he's evil. But that's not the intent,' tweeted Rogen on Sunday. 'North Korea has produced tons of propaganda films that portray America's destruction.' But cybersecurity expert Hemanshu Nigam has told the Hollywood Reporter that he finds it hard to believe that North Korea is the perpetrator and instead thinks it is more probable that it was the actions of an employee or ex-employee with administrative access privileges. For the studio - which has laid off hundreds of employees over the past year in an effort to contain costs - the possibility of a disgruntled employee wreaking havoc is very real. 'If terabytes of data left the Sony networks, their network detection systems would have noticed easily,' said Nigam. 'It would also take months for a hacker to figure out the topography of the Sony networks to know where critical assets are stored and to have access to the decryption keys needed to open up the screeners that have been leaked.' Scary: Sony workers saw a message appear on computer screens saying 'Hacked by #GOP' - understood to be the initials of a group called Guardians of Peace which has been linked to North Korea . In addition, he said, 'It is possible that North Korean-sponsored hackers were working with someone on the inside. But it is more likely a ruse to shift blame, knowing the distaste the North Korean regime has for Sony Pictures.' Sony Pictures' computer system went down last Monday after the cyber attack. Before . screens went dark, they displayed a red skull and the phrase . 'Hacked By #GOP,' which reportedly stands for Guardians of . Peace. The hackers also warned they . would release 'secrets' stolen from Sony. The data released so far from the apparently leaked documents has already been damaging - it revealed all the top executives at Sony Pictures Entertainment are white and male, raising questions about control of Hollywood's film output.","Sony was the target of a large-scale communications breach last week, and it's believed a group tied to North Korea is responsible .

"David Cameron told his wife she did not need to worry about him going for dinner with Silvio Berlusconi – because he would get an aide to pull him out of the Jacuzzi before the ‘whores’ turned up. Mr Cameron made the quip before heading to Rome for a state dinner with his Italian counterpart, it was revealed today. Graffiti artist Ben Eine was in Downing Street when the PM cracked the joke after being invited for tea and biscuits. Italy's former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and David Cameron met for dinner in 2010 . Mr Cameron joked to his wife that she did not need to worry about him meeting the billionaire former Italian PM . Earlier this year, Mr Berlusconi was unexpectedly cleared of paying for sex with a minor at a series of sordid 'bunga bunga' sex parties. The court said the billionaire media tycoon had paid for sex with a 17-year-old prostitute known as 'Ruby the Heartstealer'. But they said there was no proof he knew her age. Mr Berlusconi, now aged 78, quit as Italy's prime minister in 2011 during a serious escalation of the euro zone crisis but remains politically active and still leads his centre-right Forza Italia party. He is currently banned from holding public office after being convicted of tax fraud, and has been doing community service at a care home as part of his sentence. Mr Eine’s painting Twenty First Century City was presented to Barack Obama in 2010 on Mr Cameron’s first trip to Washington in 2010. Shortly after ward the artist was invited to Number 10 – just before Mr Cameron was due in Rome for his first meeting with the then Italian leader. Mr Cameron jokingly reassured his wife that he would not be sharing jacuzzis, Mr Eine told a told a conference in London. The artist, a self-confessed former graffiti vandal, revealed Mr Cameron’s unguarded remarks during a filmed interview to mark the start of three-day conference on graffiti at London’s South Bank centre. Mr Eine said the PM had to leave early to travel to Rome. He said: ‘We were sitting there chatting away and his PA or assistant came in and said: “David, we’ve got to go”. ‘And he jumped up and said “Samantha I’ve got to go off to Italy – dinner with Berlusconi. Don’t worry I’ll get so-and-so to pull me out of the jacuzzi before the whores turn up”. ‘And then he walked out the door. And I was like, that’s great, prime ministers aren’t meant to say that in front of bods like me, just in case I do this and repeat the story in front of a video camera. ‘I started off tagging stuff – I’m not meant to be having tea and biscuits with the prime minister.’ Street artist Ben Eines photographed in front of his work on Middlesex Street, in east London was invited for tea and biscuits with the Camerons . Mr Eine's painting was one of the official gifts given to Barack Obama from David Cameron on his first trip to Washington as Prime Minister in 2010 . Mr Eine praised the Prime Minister but said he would never vote for him, the Guardian reported. He said: ‘I have never voted in my life and I would never vote Tory. ‘[But] I really enjoyed talking to him. He was interesting, he was funny. He’s obviously a really smart and on the ball man.’ Mr Cameron’s first meeting with Berlusconi came after a 38-year-old prostitute, Maria Teresa De Nicolo, described how she and a host of other women enjoyed a meal with Italy’s prime minister before she and a couple of the others joined him in bed. A No 10 spokesman said Downing Street never comments on private conversations.","PM made quip before trip to Rome for dinner with his Italian counterpart .

"The mother of an Oakland teen who was declared brain dead after having tonsil surgery in December - and then became the focus of a struggle between her family and the hospital over whether to keep her on life support - is speaking out for the first time in over a month. In the letter, sent via-Facebook to KTVU Channel 2 news anchor Frank Somerville, 13-year-old Jahi McMath's mother, Nailah Winkfield, thanked those who have supported her during her struggle to keep her daughter alive. Additionally, she says that her daughter is alive and not suffering - now that she's been moved from the Children's Hospital Oakland to a long-term care facility. SCROLL DOWN FOR THE FULL TEXT OF WINKFIELD'S LETTER . Wedding: This photograph shows Jahi McMath (right) at the wedding of her step-father Marvin Winkfield (2nd right) to her mother Naliah (not pictured) - also in this photograph are Mariana Winkfield (left) and her grandmother Sandra Chatman (2nd left) 'I have been surrounded by the love, . support and prayers of so many kind people,' Winkfield says in the letter. 'Despite what people say . about my daughter being dead and how I must be ignorant not to get that, . I can tell you that she is much better physically since she has left . Children's Hospital and I see changes that give me hope.' McMath was declared brain dead following a tonsil surgery intended to help the girl's sleep apnea on December 9. Following the surgery, the girl suffered tremendous blood loss and went into cardiac arrest. The poor circulation as a result of the severe blood loss caused injuries to her brain that doctors considered to be fatal. Brief relief: Nailah Winkfield has an emotional moment Monday after learning her daughter Jahi McMath will be kept on life support until January 7 . Wrenching moment: Nailah Winkfield (right) has a . moment of relief after Monday evening's news that her daughter Jahi . McMath (right) may remain on life support until January 7 after a judge . granted a temporary halt to plans to remove the 13-year-old from life . support . It has been over a month since I have spoken about my life with Jahi to anyone outside a very small circle of family and friends. So many people have asked how we are doing and if Jahi is alive. This has and continues to be an unbelievably difficult time for me as a mother and for us as a family. I have withdrawn for reasons of safety and privacy and to focus on my daughter and my role as her mother. However, I have not been alone. I have been surrounded by the love, support and prayers of so many kind people. Despite what people say about my daughter being dead and how I mustbe ignorant not to get that, I can tell you that she is much better physically since she has left Children's Hospital and I see changes that give me hope. As I prayed today, I felt called to express to people that I am truly grateful for the amount of love and support my daughter Jahi McMath and I have received from people all over the world. We feel your prayer and support. Because of your unselfish generosity I was able to do what I was afraid I would never be able to do, move my daughter from Children's Hospital Oakland before they removed her from her ventilator and stopped her heart. This was itself a miracle. Please know that all of thesupport we received has been used towards helping Jahi. If I had it my way, I would say thank you to each and every person in their native language so they could understand how much I appreciate them for all their support and, most importantly, prayers. It is my belief that faith in God, your prayers, and the incredible kindness of good hearted medical professionals, are the main reasons my daughter is alive today. I know people are concerned and I want to make sure you know that Jahi is not suffering, she is surrounded by love. I will never let her suffer. On the long hard days when I'm feeling down, I think about all the people who are praying for me and Jahi and I feel so much better. I want you to know that I'm praying for you as well. Thank you to all of the people who view my daughter as the sweet, innocent, 13-year-old girl that she is and not a dead body or a corpse, I deeply appreciate that. Thank you to everyone who hasn't forgot how my daughter got into this situation in the first place. No one should have to go through this. I would like to thank all of the people who have reached out to me and shared their stories of their family members. Some have been heartbreaking. Some have given me hope. All have helped me feel that I am not the only person who has had this struggle. Some of you have shared how you fought for your loved ones and they got better, some of you have shared your regret with not fighting more and some shared with me the incredibly difficult decisions you made to let go. I have prayed for you as you have for me. Sadly, I can say I know how you feel. I also want to thank those who felt the need to go public with their opinions about me and my daughter, positive and even negative. It is because of you that my daughter's experience is so relevant and that people all over the world know who Jahi Mcmath is. What you may not know is that her name, Jahi, means one who is known by many. Hopefully my daughter can change some of the ways brain death is viewed in today's society. Honestly, I think she already has. Finally, thank you for all the love, support and prayers you give Jahi every day. I am certain that she knows you are praying for her. I feel the support from your prayer all the time. I don't think I or Jahi would be here today without you. May God bless all who have shown love and compassion as well as those who have expressed their contempt. All are deserving of God's grace and love. For those who believe, please, keep praying for Jahi. God can overcome all things and I believe that His will has yet to be fully revealed. I love Jahi and where there is love, there is hope.

"Barcelona forward Lionel Messi's yellow card for time-wasting after he was apparently hit on the head by an object thrown from the crowd in Sunday's La Liga game at Valencia has been rescinded by the Spanish soccer federation (RFEF). Barca's initial appeal was rejected by the RFEF's competition committee and the club lodged a second challenge with a higher appeals committee which ruled in their favour on Thursday. The RFEF said on its website the committee had been unable to detect 'deliberate time-wasting' on Messi's part but only 'a normal reaction from someone who had suffered an aggression by a spectator'.

Lionel Messi goes down clutching his head in stoppage time after being hit on the head with a bottle . Messi is clearly in pain after being struck on the head by the object in the closing stages of the contest .

"Wayne Rooney is no stranger to the karaoke machine, having been filmed warbling his way through Ed Sheeran's track Lego House in a Manchester pub last month. And now it seems that the England captain has been at it again, this time while celebrating with wife Coleen and his fellow Manchester United players at the team Christmas party. Rooney, who is currently having scans on a potential knee injury, posted this image on his Instagram page with the caption: 'My turn to do a song at the Manchester United Christmas party!' Scroll down for video . Wayne Rooney posted this image on his Instagram page along with the caption 'My turn to do a song at the Manchester United Christmas party!' In another image, which appears to be from the same event, the England striker can be seen watching someone else perform alongside wife Coleen (left) and teammates Ashley Young and Darren Fletcher (right) In the picture the forward, who is a fan of Stereophonics and Queen, can be seen with a look of concentration on his face while clicking his fingers along to the music. He is standing on stage at The Place Aparthotel, a converted former warehouse in Manchester, surrounded by the venue's house band. In a second shot, which appears to be from the same event, Rooney is standing in the crowd apparently watching someone else perform alongside his wife, her friends and teammates Ashley Young and Darren Fletcher. Rooney has also been pictured singing in the past, such as in this karaoke bar in Barbados while on holiday with Coleen and his children. He sang seven tracks, including Queen We Are The Champions . At the start of November Rooney was videoed singing along to Lego House along with musician Ed Sheeran in The Sir Ralph Abercromby pub in central Manchester. The millionaire footballer was filmed sitting on a stool with a pint of lager on the table next to him, and at times closed his eyes and clasped his hands together as he sang one of his favourite songs. The crowd joined in although at times those watching could be heard giggling as Rooney struggled to hit some of the notes. Long before his rise to international fame as England's captain and star striker, Wayne Rooney seems to have harboured an ambition to be a musician. During his days playing at Everton he was rumoured to be making a rap track with Mark Morrison, who sang 'Return of the Mack' which was UK number 1 in 1996. Rooney also claims to know all the words to every song in Oliver, and has the title of a Stereophonic album - Just Enough Education to Perform - tattooed on his arm. In 2007, he serenaded then-girlfriend Coleen McLoughlin with Lionel Richie's All Night Long after a Valentines Day meal in Manchester. Wayne, 29, later documented their late night drinks by sharing a fun post-show snap with his 10.1 million Twitter followers. The Manchester United forward is known for his love of music and has the title of the Stereophonics' album Just Enough Education to Perform tattooed on his arm. And in 2011 he took to the stage while on holiday in Barbados with his family to sing a seven-song set on a karaoke machine in a bar. He belted out Queen hit We Are The Champions and Yesterday by The Beatles after asking people for requests. He later tweeted: 'Having a great night in Barbados! In lexys piano bar with ColeenRoo and friends. Been on the mic for about 7 songs and felt like a rock star'. Rooney has long harboured musical ambitions, and during his early days of playing at Everton he was rumoured to be making a rap record with Mark Morrison - who's song 'Return of the Mack' was a UK number one single in 1996. Rooney also once revealed via his webpage that he is a fan of 50 Cent, Jay Z and the Arctic Monkeys - and claims to know every song from the musical Oliver. His musical charms also extended to his love life. In 2007 he serenaded then-girlfriend Coleen McLoughlin with Lionel Richie's All Night Long in a Manchester restaurant after a Valentine's Day meal.

"Accused: Alicia Gould, 28,  has been charged with attempted murder . A 28-year-old woman has been charged with attempted murder after police say she threw a plugged-in radio alarm clock into a motel bathtub while her boyfriend was in it. Police in the Rochester suburb of Webster tell local media that Alicia Gould and her boyfriend were in a room at motel early Friday when they got into an argument. It is alleged that while the man was taking a bath, Gould threw the radio alarm clock into the water in an attempt to electrocute him. Police say the room's ground fault interrupter went off, stopping any electrical current from making its way through the water. Police arrived at the Super 8 Motel at 4:32 a.m. on November 28. Webster Police Chief Gerald Pickering said: 'Officers arrived at the scene and through their investigation, found a male and a female that were in a domestic disturbance. 'It appeared that the female had attempted to murder her male counterpart. He said under New York State Law Gould was arrested immediately. 'It sounded like there was some admissions, some confessions made to the investigators and the 911 dispatchers prior to the response,' Pickering said. 'Attempted murder': Police say Gould tossed a plugged-in radio alarm clock into a motel (pictured) bathtub while her boyfriend was in it . 'I'm sure that there are circumstances that may come out regarding the allegation, and perhaps in defense of the victim.'

"Honored: Jahi McMath, a 13-year-old California girl who was declared brain-dead after suffering complications from sleep apnea surgery, will receive an honorary diploma during her schools eighth grade graduation . The family of a 13-year-old California girl who was declared brain-dead after suffering complications from sleep apnea surgery says she will receive an honorary diploma during her school's eighth grade graduation. Omari Sealey, the uncle of Jahi McMath, said Wednesday the girl's school, E.C. Reems Academy of Technology and Arts in Oakland, will give the diploma to a family member. The school's graduation ceremony is Friday. Jahi was in eighth grade and scheduled to . graduate when she underwent tonsil surgery at UCSF Benioff Children's . Hospital Oakland in December. Her heart stopped and she went into cardiac arrest causing brain damage. She was later . declared brain-dead. The hospital said was so . severe that she was effectively dead with no chance of survival if a . respirator was turned off. Her family went to court to prevent the . hospital from taking her off the machine. Jahi was eventually released . to them and moved to another facility. Sealey said his niece is doing well. Three doctors and the court agreed she was brain dead and the hospital applied to turn off her life support machine. Hope: Jahi's family are certain that she will one day recover despite the hospital's insistence there is no chance of that happening . But her family, led by  Jahi’s uncle Omari Sealey, refused to accept the prognosis and argued there was still a chance she could recover. They said that she responded to her mother’s voice and asked that she be removed to a hospital that cared for her. Earlier this year, Oakland's Children's Hospital insisted the girl could not be be rehabilitated. 'This is a deceased young woman,' Children's Hospital Oakland spokesman Sam Singer said. 'No amount of food, medicine, medical machinery, time or hope is going to bring back her back. 'So it's really wrong and unethical for Mr. Dolan (the family lawyer) to mislead the family and the public that there's any amount of hope or any food that could possibly bring back this deceased young woman. Devastated: Jahi's parents fought to keep their 13-year-old daughter alive after she was declared brain dead following complications in routine tonsil surgery last December . Devotion: Jahi's parents haven't left her bedside since the tragedy during a routine tonsil operation although she has now been moved hospitals . Jahi's family, led by her mother . Nailah and uncle Omari Sealey, have refused to accept the prognosis and . argued there was still a chance she could recover. Jahi's family has raised more than $61,000 on GoFundMe.com to move her. In a recent update, a her mother provided details on Jahi's condition. 'Jahi . is still sleep but physically stable! No pic lines, no catheters, no . I.V, she maintains all her vitals on her own, no medicines needed. I am . giving her lots of vitamins and fish oil thru her feeding tube. She . moves around so much that we have to put pillows around her bed. She . responds to pain, cold and touch. She can turn her head from left to . right and her ventilator is set to room air so she is not getting any . extra oxygen like she was before. Her . skin is flawless and she gets a mani and pedi every week done by me . (mom) She gets physical therapy three times a week and never has a stiff . joint!

"Hallowe'en may have passed for another year, but  deer with vampire-like fangs are still haunting the hills of Afghanistan. It is the first time that rare fanged Kashmir musk deer has been spotted in over 60 years. Despite their ghoulish appearance, the endangered male creatures use their fangs during mating season to seduce females and fend off love rivals, instead of sucking blood. Fangs for the memories: Researchers have spotted Kashmir musk deer (stock image) in the hills of Afghanistan for the first time in over 60 years. The endangered male creatures use their fangs during mating season to seduce females and fend off love rivals, instead of sucking blood . One of seven similar species found in Asia, Kashmir musk deer live on the rugged forested slopes of northeast Afghanistan, according to the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) which came across a small population when conducting a recent survey. The last scientific sighting in Nuristan province, Afghanistan, was believed to have been made by a Danish survey team traversing the region in 1948. The species is endangered due to habitat loss and poaching, according to the study published in the journal Oryx. The creature produces a musk that is used in perfumes, incense and medicine. Its scent glands are coveted by wildlife traffickers and are considered more valuable by weight than gold, fetching as much as $45,000/kilo (£28,121) on the black market. By way of comparison, the price of gold per kilo at the time of writing, is $37,624/kilo (£23,511). The last scientific sighting of the deer (stock image pictured) in Nuristan province, Afghanistan, was believed to have been made by a Danish survey team traversing the region in 1948 . One of seven similar species found in Asia, Kashmir musk deer live on the rugged forested slopes of northeast Afghanistan (marked in red). The survey team recorded five sightings of the rare deer, including a solitary male in the same area on three occasions and one female with a juvenile . The animal’s ‘fangs’ (pictured) are described  as tusks, because they are used during the rutting season, when males clash with each other . The animal’s ‘fangs’ are described by zoologists as tusks, because they are used during the rutting season, when males clash with each other to secure a mate. The survey team recorded five sightings of the rare deer, including a solitary male in the same area on three occasions, one female with a juvenile, and one solitary female, which may have been the same individual without her young. All sightings were in steep rocky outcrops interspersed with alpine meadows and scattered, dense high bushes of juniper and rhododendron. According to the team, the Kashmir musk deer were discrete, cryptic and difficult to spot and could not be photographed. Despite their obscurity, experts say the species and its habitat must be protected in order for it to continue to survive in Afghanistan. ‘Musk deer are one of Afghanistan's living treasures,’ said co-author Peter Zahler, WCS Deputy Director of Asia Programs. ‘This rare species, along with better known wildlife such as snow leopards, are the natural heritage of this struggling nation. We hope that conditions will stabilise soon to allow WCS and local partners to better evaluate conservation needs of this species.’ In the meantime, the society has trained local people in Nuristan to continue its research and protection of the species until security conditions improve. The Kashmir musk deer (Moschus cupreus) is an endangered species native to Afghanistan, India and Pakistan. Adults typically stand two feet tall and only the males have tusks, which they use for rutting. The deer hasn't been seen in Afghanistan since 1948. The species produces a musk that is used in perfumes, incense and medicine. Because of this its scent glands are incredibly valuable. They are coveted by wildlife traffickers and are considered more valuable by weight than gold, fetching as much as $45,000/kilo (£28,121) on the black market.","Kashmir musk deer has been spotted for the first time in over 60 years .

"On Thursday Washington, D.C., began its three-day final farewell to the late Marion Barry, the former mayor who remained a hero to many in the city despite a crack cocaine conviction. Barry, known as the District of Columbia's 'mayor for life' after four terms in office, died on November 23 at 78 due to heart problems. He was a city councilman when he died, representing impoverished Ward 8. Barry's coffin, draped in West African kente cloth and piled high with red roses, lay in repose at city hall after police pallbearers carried it past mourners, media and political leaders. Respect; A casket containing the remains of former District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry sits in the front lobby of the John A. Wilson Building, the District's city hall, where Barry spent 16 years as mayor and another 16 years on the D.C. Council . Civil rights leader the Rev. Jesse Jackson Jr. accompanied Barry's family into the black-draped building. Many of the mourners said Barry, the son of a Mississippi sharecropper, had transformed the U.S. capital by giving jobs and hope to black residents. 'He's like a messiah for the district. He paved the way for many, many, many of us, African Americans as well as people in general,' said Diane Lyons, 54, a healthcare worker. Bernard Barker, 53, a laborer who had arrived at 6:30 a.m. to be first in line, prayed at Barry's coffin. 'I just said, 'God bless you, Mr. Marion Barry, God bless your family.'

"Poverty affects the intelligence of children as young as two, a study has found - and its impact increases as the child ages. Deprived young children were found to have IQ scores six points lower, on average, than children from wealthier families. And the gap got wider throughout childhood, with the early difference tripling by the time the children reached adolescence. Poverty affects the intelligence of children as young as two, a study has found - and its impact increases as the child ages. Deprived young children were found to have IQ scores six points lower, on average, than children from wealthier families. A stock image of children on a condemned estate in Glasgow are show . Scientists from Goldsmiths, University of London compared data on almost 15,000 children and their parents as part of the Twins Early Development Study (Teds). The study is an on-going investigation socio-economic and genetic links to intelligence. Children were assessed nine times between the ages of two and 16, using a mixture of parent-administered, web and telephone-based tests. Technology may be getting smarter, but humans are getting dumber, scientists have warned. Evidence suggests that the IQs of people in the UK, Denmark and Australia have declined in the last decade. Opinion is divided as to whether the trend is long-term, but some researchers believe that humans have already reached intellectual peak. An IQ test used to determine whether Danish men are fit to serve in the military has revealed scores have fallen by 1.5 points since 1998. And standard tests issued in the UK and Australia echo the results, according to journalist Bob Holmes, writing in New Scientist. The results, published in the journal Intelligence, revealed that children from wealthier backgrounds with more opportunities scored higher in IQ tests at the age of two, and experienced greater IQ gains over time. Dr Sophie von Stumm, from Goldsmiths, University of London, who led the study, said: 'We’ve known for some time that children from low socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds perform on average worse on intelligence tests than children from higher SES backgrounds, but the developmental relationship between intelligence and SES had not been previously shown. 'Our research establishes that relationship, highlighting the link between SES and IQ. 'We hope that our findings will drive future research into the specific mechanisms and factors that underpin the link between SES and IQ and thus, contribute to widening the IQ gap.' Last year, a study by the University of Exeter revealed that children from poor backgrounds and one-parent families are more likely to suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which could affect their ability to excel at school. Researchers found a link between social and economic status and childhood ADHD in Britain by analysing data from the Millennium Cohort Study - a database of more than 19,500 British children born between 2000 and 2002. While young children were found to have IQ scores on average six points lower than their wealthier peers, the intelligence gap was found to triple by the time they reached adolescence, which means their background arguably puts them at a disadvantage in exams such as GCSES. A stock image is shown . The study, published in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, showed that there was a greater prevalence of ADHD among children from families living below the poverty line. The researchers found the average family income for a household with a child affected by ADHD was £324 ($509) per week, compared to £391 ($614) for those with unaffected children. They also revealed that the chance of parents in social housing having a child with ADHD was roughly three times greater than for those who owned their own homes. Mothers with no qualifications were more than twice as likely to have a child with ADHD as those with degrees, and lone parents were more likely to have a child with ADHD than households with two live-in parents.","Scientists compared data on almost 15,000 children and their parents .

"An Iraqi soldier has revealed his incredible survival story after being lined up for execution by an ISIS firing squad - only for the gun-wielding jihadi to miss him by a matter of millimeters. Ali Hussein Kadhim, a Shiite Iraqi soldier, was safely back home with his wife and young children in southern Iraq this week after being one of hundreds abducted by the extremist Sunni militants in Tikrit in June. While his Sunni Iraqi colleagues were spared death,  Mr Kadhim - a Shiite Iraqi soldier - was ordered to be executed. Scroll down for video . Safe return: Ali Hussein Kadhim with his son and daughter at his family's date orchard in Diwaniya, south Iraq this week . Ali Hussein Kadhim, a Shiite Iraqi soldier, pictured on Wednesday, was one of hundreds abducted by the extremist group in Tikrit, Iraq in June . Playing dead: Mr Kadhim, 23, has identified himself (circled in the picture from June) in this footage released by ISIS of their 'victims' after abducting and murdering hundreds of Shiite Iraqi soldiers. Incredibly, Mr Kadhim survived . After shooting three Shiite soldiers in the back of the head, the assassin turned his gun on 23-year-old Mr Kadhim - and missed. Instinctively, the soldier fell forwards into an open grave dug for the victims of the murderous rampage. It was a decision that would save his life. Speaking to the New York Times on Wednesday, Mr Kadhim, who is married with a daughter and baby son, described the sensation of the bullet breezing past his temple. Mr Kadhim lay still among the bodies for hours as he waited for the ISIS extremists to leave. He then fled the bloody scene under cover of darkness and hid out by the Tigris River, a few hundred yards away. He spent three days on the run, eating plants to survive. 'I saw my daughter in my mind saying ""Father, father"",' he told the newspaper from his home in southern Iraq. 'I just pretended to be shot'. After waiting hours for the ISIS fighters to leave, Mr Kadhim (pictured this week) spent three days on the run after escaping execution . Horrific: The militant group has posted a number of slick images, like this photograph on June 14, of them leading Iraqis to their deaths . Rampage: Islamic State fighters have killed hundreds of innocent civilians as they rampage across Iraq and Syria (picture published on June 14) After ISIS released sickening images of their victims lying face-down in the dirt with their hands bound behind their backs, Mr Kadhim managed to identify himself in the line-up. ISIS released the slickly-produced, disturbing footage of the siege on the Islamic religious holiday of Eid earlier this year. The video showed prisoners being rounded up and summarily executed, suicide bombers boasting before blowing up buildings and Iraqis being gunned down in drive-by shootings. In one of the most shocking segments, terrified prisoners are piled into the back of trucks, where they hold each other and huddle in fear before being driven off to their deaths. The 36-minute film then cuts to dozens of prisoners lying face down on the ground, hands bound behind their backs, waiting to be executed. 'I wanted to live': Mr Kadhim, who is now reunited with his wife and young children, said he kept thinking of his family as he lay among other Shiite Iraqis waiting to be executed . It is in that final shot that Mr Kadhim saw himself, trying to act lifeless with the blood of another soldier splattered across his face. He is one of the only known survivors of the murderous rampage at the hands of Islamic State militants as they claimed Tikrit two months ago. The group now  controls an estimated four million people. The siege in June was a key turning point in the group's invasion into Iraq from Syria. Mr Kadhim's chilling first-hand account of ISIS's well-documented brutality came as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry issued a dramatic call to arms against the extremists today, urging world leaders to join a 'core coalition' to end their murderous rampage through Iraq, but ruled out putting 'boots on the ground'. And in what could prove not just a major turning point in the war against ISIS but also an unprecedented sea-change in America's relations with Iran, Ayatollah Khamenei today answered Kerry's call from Tehran, ordering his army to fight shoulder-to-shoulder with U.S., Kurdish and Iraqi forces against the extremist horde.","Ali Hussein Kadhim, 23, was captured by ISIS in June in Tikrit, Iraq .

"Bill Cosby has hit back at a woman who claims he got her drunk and sexually assaulted her when she was 15 at the Playboy Mansion. The under-fire comic, now 77, is accused of attacking 19 women, and has so far remained silent amid the myriad of claims. However, today, he has chosen to file court papers against Judy Huth - who is suing him for alleged sexual assault in 1974 - an incident which may well be investigated by Los Angeles cops. Cosby calls her claims 'absolutely false' and in papers seen by MailOnline, the star claims Miss Hath's lawyer tried to extort him for $100,000 - and then raised the price to $250,000 as new women came forward to make similar claims. Lawsuit: Bill Cosby is accusing Judy Huth, who says he attacked her when she was 15, of extortion. She has launched a lawsuit against him for sexual assault . Demands: Attorney Gloria Allred is flanked by Bill Cosby accusers at her office on Wednesday, from left, Chelan Lasha, Beth Ferrier and Helen Hayes . Weeping: Chelan Lasha, now a grandmother, breaks down on Wednesday afternoon as she claims that Cosby drugged and assaulted her when she was 17 . In the court papers, Cosby says Miss Huth's lawyer approached his attorney Marty Singer last month and made 'ominous references to criminal penalties.' The lawyer, Cosby claims, demanded cash in return for silence - upping the demands as more women came forward. Cosby alleges that Miss Huth tried to sell the story to the media 10 years ago, but no-one would publish her claims. The court papers state:  'Approximately 10 years ago, plaintiff Judith Huff unsuccessfully tried to get money from a tabloid by selling the same story about Bill Cosby that is the subject of this lawsuit. 'Knowing that since she disclosed her allegations to a media outlet 10 years ago, she cannot claim to have a repressed memory.' The argument of a repressed memory would allow Miss Huth to file a civil lawsuit within three years of the time she remembered. However, if she recalled the incident a decade ago, her lawsuit is moot, Cosby's papers state. Miss Huth filed her own suit on Tuesday, alleging she has suffered 'psychological injuries and illnesses' that she only connected to the assault within the last three years. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for sexual battery and emotional distress. She claims she first met Cosby as a teenager with her 16-year-old friend as they wandered on to the set of his movie. He invited them to his L.A. Country tennis club the following Saturday, where they then followed him to a house where he 'served them alcohol beverages and played games of billiards' with Miss Huth, according to the lawsuit. Miss Huth was required to drink a beer every time Cosby won a game, the lawsuit said. Later, the girls followed Cosby to the Playboy Mansion, where the comedian told Huth and her friend to say they were 19 if anyone asked their ages, according to the papers. At one point, Miss Huth  emerged from a bathroom to find Cosby sitting on a bed. The lawsuit states he asked her to sit down next to him and attempted to 'put his hand down her pants'. He then took her hand in his and performed a sexual act on himself 'without her consent', the lawsuit said. 'This traumatic incident, at such a tender age, has caused psychological damage and mental anguish ... that has caused her significant problems through her life,' the lawsuit said. However, Cosby claims that Miss Huth lied about playing a 'drinking game' with him where the pair drank three beers, as his lawyer says it well known that Cosby is a 'lifelong non-drinker'. Cosby's papers state: 'The drinking age in California at the time was 21.' The papers state that Miss Huth's lawyer did not even know if she was seeing a therapist, accusing her and her lawyer of 'engaging in a shakedown' Cosby is now demanding that the lawsuit is dismissed and has requested 'monetary sanctions of not less than $33,295.' Attorney Gloria Allred yesterday challenged Cosby to pay $100 million in damages to the women who claim he sexually assaulted them. The lawyer introduced three alleged victims - two who have never spoken before - and as they broke down in tears, she told Cosby he could waive the statute of limitations so all the women accusing him of assault could have their day in court. If not, she said, he could stump up $100 million - and the money would be handed out to the women by a committee of retired judges. Speaking at her California law offices, Miss Allred said she had been forced to tell many women who had contacted her to report abuse at the hands of the comic legend that they were too late to file a lawsuit due to the statute of limitations. However, she said: 'Today, I am here to propose two new solutions to this public dilemma and a away to determine if Bill Cosby is a saint of a sexual predator.' She said that if Cosby is 'confident' he has done nothing wrong, he could waive the statute of limitations, adding: 'Then his alleged victims would have an opportunity to have their allegations dealt with on their merits. The woman who started it all: Andrea Constand, a former basketball player, sued Cosby in 2005 and settled later on. Beth Ferrier was Jane Doe No 5 in Andrea's civil court case . Emotional: Former supermodel Janice Dickinson says Cosby drugged and raped her in 1982 . Alleged victims: Tamara Green (left) and Barbara Bowman (right) join the ranks of woman who claim Cosby assaulted them . 'Bill Cosby would have an opportunity to address there allegations in a court of law and the victims and Mr Cosby would have an opportunity to have a judge and jury decide who should be believed.' This would be similar, Miss Allred said, to the Catholic Church cases in California, which involved allegations of sexual abuse by priests.  A law allowed victims to sue within a one year period. Alternatively, Miss Allred said, if Cosby did not want to waive the statute of limitations, he could pour $100 million into a fund, adding that anyone who claims to be a victim could put their case in front of a panel of retired judges, who would act as arbitrators, who would then decided if their case had merit - and how much damages they would be awarded. Cosby has an estimated fortune of $400 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. He has made his fortune through numerous endorsements including Jell-O, Coca-Cola and Ford - and dominating TV in the 1980s with The Cosby Show. Cosby’s syndication deal in 1988 also earned him a fortune. Rights to air The Cosby Show for three years were sold to Fox for $550 million. He currently lives with his wife of 51 years, Camille, in a compound in Shelburne Falls, Massachusetts, that includes two large farmhouses. They couple moved in in 1971 and also bought several acres around the town for conservation purposes. However, Miss Allred said: 'It's time for justice and accountability and we challenge him to end this nightmare, both for him and the alleged victims by accepting either of the options that I proposed and we look forward to his response.' Chelan Lasha, from California - now believed to be a 46-year-old Grandmother - told how Cosby attacked her when she was just 17 in 1986 when she was an aspiring model. Weeping, she said her stepmother had sent pictures of her to the star and he called her at home in Las Vegas, inviting her to the Hilton Las Vegas, where he was performing and she had a job. She then went up to Elvis Presley suite to meet him and after telling him she had a cold, he gave her a blue pill, which he said was an antihistimine, with a double shot of Amaretto. She said: 'He was rubbing my neck and saying that he might have to have someone come in and give me stress therapy.' She claimed he told her to change into a Hilton bathrobe and wet her hair to see the modelling scout. Someone did briefly come up to the room, pertaining to be from the Ford Modelling Agency -telling her to she needed to lose 10 pounds - and taking some pictures. Then, Chelan said, Cosby walked her to the bedroom and gave her another shot of Amaretto, which he claimed would help her cold. No comment: Bill Cosby yesterday thanked Whoopi Goldberg and singer Jill Scott for their support on Twitter - but has made no public statement . 'I laid down,' she said: 'He laid down next to me on the bed and began pinching my left nipple and humping my leg while he was grunting. 'I could not open my eyes. I couldn't move or say anything. I felt something warm on my legs. Then I blacked out.' 'Thirteen to sixteen hours later I woke up by hearing Mr Cosby clapping his hands and saying 'Daddy says wake up'. He gave me $1500. He said the money was to buy something nice for me and my grandmother and he also invited me to go to the Temptations show with my grandmother. 'My grandmother went but I did not go because I was too sick. Then he invited us to his show. My grandmother really want to go. I did not, but I went with her and heckled him. As a result, I was fired my from job.' Chelan was joined by two other women, Helen Hayes, who claims Cosby fondled her breast after stalking her and her friends 'like a predator' after they met in the summer of 1973. Beth Ferrier, meanwhile, who has already come forward, alleges that she had an affair with Cosby, which ended in him drugging and raping her - and leaving her to come to in her car in an alleyway. She was Jane Doe 5 in the civil suit brought against Cosby by Andrea Costand, the first woman to allege he had attacked her, in 2005. Former basketball player Andrea ended up settling out of court.

"Dawn Steckmann for more than $400,000, after she was fired for taking too many bathroom breaks while pregnant . A woman in Oregon is suing her former high-tech employer for more than $400,000, contending she was fired while pregnant with her second child after being told that she took too many restroom breaks. The suit filed in Circuit Court says Dawn Steckmann and other employees had never been told they needed to clock out before using the restroom at Maxim Integrated Products. The lawsuit alleges pregnancy and gender discrimination. It says that when Steckmann was pregnant with her first child in 2011, she asked a supervisor whether she should go off the clock because she was urinating more frequently and was told that wasn't necessary. During her second pregnancy in 2013, restroom visits were more frequent because of a bladder condition caused by her first pregnancy, and 'she would not even have had time to clock out to use the restroom without an accident,' the suit says. In June 2013, Steckmann was called to a meeting with her supervisor and a human resources manager who asked why she was not clocking out for restroom breaks. Her supervisor claimed he had told Steckmann she needed to clock out, reports The Oregonian. The human resources manager told Steckmann that for all he knew, she could be watching movies in the bathroom, according to the lawsuit.

"Three grey men in grey T-shirts delivered a grey document on Thursday aimed at redefining the England football team as something a little less bulldog and a little more greyhound. Billed as 'England DNA: Evolving. Developing. Winning', it is the product of 12 months of hiring and firing and restructuring behind the scenes by Dan Ashworth, the FA's director of elite development and will involve giving the players memory-chip wristbands which they can access back at their clubs so they can remember the work they have done with their country. Ashworth has kept his profile low since replacing Sir Trevor Brooking in this role, busily putting things in place and this was his coming out party, formalising the power-shift behind the scenes. Dan Ashworth (right), the FA's director of elite development, pictured with England Under 21 manager Gareth Southgate revealed the 'England DNA' blueprint on Thursday . He presented the document with U21 manager Gareth Southgate and head of player and coach development Matt Crocker, recruited from Southampton, where the prolific Academy is under the authority of Les Reed, former technical director of the FA, who once worked with Howard Wilkinson to produce a document very like this one. Ashworth has busily created a new blueprint aimed at redefining the England national team . The irony must have been lost somewhere between Wembley and St George's Park, where Ashworth will extend his DNA vision to 1,500 coaches from the FA's Licensed Coaches' Club who will gather, over the weekend. It is simply a collection of commonsense ideas committed to print after thorough research, including studies into how other nations do things - six in Europe and three in South America. It may help coaches at all levels to have a point of reference about what the international teams are striving for, and it may help players of different ages to have a memory stick on a wristband which reminds them of what playing for England is about, should they chose to plug it into their laptop or tablet. But, in truth, this is another largely underwhelming document trying to be all things to as many people as possible, without causing offence. Ashworth's team want England want to break from the traditional blood and sweat, but not forget about it. They want to work with the clubs, but want more players to be released by clubs to boost experience on an international stage. If they want the 'golden thread' to run through the youth ranks to the senior team, the release of players by the clubs is the key. We will see how Southgate gets on when he selects a squad for the U21 Euros next year. It is hoped the ideas may help coaches at all levels have a point of reference about what the international team is striving for . To increase the number of times a player samples international football, Ashworth has introduced U15, U18 and U20 age groups. At some expense, the U20s have a full programme of fixtures, but will not play a competitively until 2017 at the earliest, since they have not qualified for next year's World Cup in New Zealand. They want players to be comfortable with the ball - and without it. They want them to be tactically aware and flexible and technically adept. They want them to 'intelligently dominate possession'. They want pride and passion and they want high standards of behaviour. Who doesn't? The FA will provide a clear coaching plan – focusing on eight positions on the field and phases of play - and the best care and support. They took a teacher with the squad to the U17 Euros in Malta, this year to help four players taking GCSEs. Chelsea's Dominic Solanke even stayed in Malta to sit an exam on the day his team-mates travelled home. Chelsea's Dominic Solanke stayed in Malta to sit an exam during a trip with the England Under 17 squad . The principles are admirable. Most of it has been heard before in different guises. England boasted they were the best prepared team at the World Cup in Brazil. They were also among the first to leave for home. Ultimately, what England need to win a World Cup is more and better players. Ashworth admits 90 per cent of player development in England is done by the clubs, which leaves him addressing the final 10 per cent, which adapts them for international football. The Premier League is two years into their Elite Player Performance Plan, their own pathway to more and better home-grown footballers. They all claim to consult closely, but do they, really? Clouding the issue further is the commission launched by FA chairman Greg Dyke with a view to creating an England team capable of winning the World Cup in 2022, by recommending feeder clubs. And a Code of Conduct, introduced by Dyke's predecessor David Bernstein, to improve behaviour. Blueprints we have aplenty. And now we have another.

"In the first case of its kind, a New York appeals court has rejected an animal rights advocate's bid to extend 'legal personhood' to chimpanzees, saying the primates are incapable of bearing the responsibilities that come with having legal rights. The unanimous ruling meant that Tommy, a 26-year-old chimpanzee is not entitled to the rights of a human and does not have to be freed by its owner . A five-judge panel of the Albany court on Thursday said attorney Steven Wise had shown that Tommy,  who lives alone in a shed in upstate New York, was an autonomous creature, but that it was not possible for him to understand the social contract that binds humans together. Scroll down for video . Captive: Animal rights activist and lawyer, Steven Wise, argued that Tommy (pictured) is being held against his will and deserves to be granted human rights and freed . Freedom: Attorney Steven Wise of the Nonhuman Rights Project, left, argues on behalf of Tommy, a chimpanzee, before the New York Supreme Court Appellate Division on Wednesday, in Albany. 'So far as legal theory is concerned, a person is any being whom the law regards as capable of rights and duties,' Presiding Justice Karen Peters wrote. 'Needless to say, unlike human beings, chimpanzees cannot bear any legal duties, submit to societal responsibilities or be held legally accountable for their actions,' That, they ruled, makes it 'inappropriate' to grant the rights of a human to the animal. Wise, representing The Nonhuman Rights Project, which he helped found in 2007, was seeking a ruling that Tommy had been unlawfully imprisoned by his owner, Patrick Lavery. Wise argued that the chimp should be released to a sanctuary in Florida. According to Wise and other experts, it is the first case anywhere in the world in which an appeals court has been asked to extend human rights to animals. There was no initial response to an email sent to Wise with a question about the possibility of a further appeal to the state's top court. Tommy's owner, Patrick Lavery, said Thursday he was pleased and expected the ruling. 'I just couldn't picture any court granting habeas corpus for an animal,' he said. 'If it works for one animal, it works for all animals. It would open a can of worms.' Content: Patrick Lavery, owner, interacts with Tommy a chimpanzee at his home in Gloversville, New York . Decision: Presiding Justice Karen Peters of the New York Supreme Court Appellate Division Third Department poses a question to Attorney Steven Wise of the Nonhuman Rights Project during arguments at the court . Attorney Steven Wise of the Nonhuman Rights Project talks to reporters after arguing on behalf of Tommy, a chimpanzee, at the New York Supreme Court Appellate Division. The court ruled against Tommy. Tommy is a former entertainment chimp who was placed with Lavery about 10 years ago. Lavery said Tommy is cared for under strict state and federal license rules and inspections. The court noted there have been no claims that Tommy has been mistreated or any of those rules have been violated. Lavery said Tommy lives in a seven-room enclosure in Gloversville with lots of toys and other 'enrichment.' Wise was not immediately available to comment. He has said that if he lost Tommy's case, he would ask for it to be heard by the Court of Appeals, New York's top state court. Lavery said in an interview that he agreed with the judges. Tommy, he said, received state-of-the-art care and was on a waiting list to be taken in by a sanctuary. 'It will be my decision where he goes, and not someone else's,' he said. Peters wrote for the court that while chimps could not be granted legal rights, Wise could lobby the state legislature to create new protections for chimps and other intelligent animals. The decision, which upheld a 2013 ruling by a state judge, came after Wise on Tuesday urged a separate court in Rochester to order the release of a deaf chimp named Kiko from a cement cage at his owner's home in Niagara Falls. Wise has also filed a third case on behalf of two chimps that live at a state university on Long Island.","A New York appeals court ruled Tommy, a 26-year-old chimpanzee is not entitled to human rights .

"Spiders can be scary enough when they’re visible, but a new species spotted in Mexico is able to hide itself by creating its own camouflage. The guerilla spider has been named Paratropis tuxtlesis and is capable of perfectly covering its body with dust and soil collected from wherever it happens to be hiding. The thin coating means the spider blends in with its surroundings, keeping it safe from predators, as well as making it easier to pounce on unsuspecting prey. The Paratropis tuxtlesis spider (pictured)  is capable of perfectly covering its body with dust and soil collected from wherever it happens to be hiding. The thin coating means the spider blends in with its surroundings kepping it safe from predators, as well as making it easier to pounce on unsuspecting prey . Researchers from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) hailed the discovery of the spider that's capable of vanishing from view as 'a sensation'. They said the arachnid was a member of the Paratropididae family, of which nine species are now known to exist in South America and Central America. The camouflaging spider was discovered in the natural protected area of Los Tuxtlas, in the south-eastern Mexican state of Veracruz. The camouflaging spider was discovered in the natural protected area of Los Tuxtlas, in the south-eastern Mexican state of Veracruz (pictured). It is distinguished from other species because it has rough skin, like scales, that is used by to attract floor particles, which in turn give it perfect camouflage . Researchers said the spider is a member of the Paratropididae family, of which nine species are now known to exist in South America and Central America. The baldlegged spiders (pictured) are closely related to tarantulas . Spiders are growing far larger in the cities than in rural environments, researchers have said. They found that rather than thriving in areas with lots of vegetation, golden orb weaver spiders living in urban areas of Sydney, Australia, were larger and had more babies. They added that an abundance of food and city lights could be to blame. 'City-dwelling orb-weaving spiders grow larger and could produce more offspring than their country cousins our research shows,' said Elizabeth Lowe of the University of Sydney, who led the research. This study showed invertebrates are sensitive to urbanisation, but that not all species are negatively affected by living in cities. ‘It is distinguished from other species because it has rough skin, like scales, that are used by the animal to attract floor particles which in turn give it perfect camouflage,’ said the university. ‘In order to make sure its vision is not obstructed by its camouflage of dirt, the spider has eyes that are raised up higher than usual so that it can see over the covering.’ The university said they first identified immature spiders of the new type in 2010, and then found adults, which are typically around four inches long, a year later. But, the discovery has only just been published in medical journal ZooKeys. Professor Oscar Federico Francke, who led the university's research team, said the name Paratropis tuxtlensis came from the geographical location where the spiders were discovered. ‘If you do not look carefully, you can lift a stone up and look and not see that the spider is there,’ continued Professor Francke. ‘In fact you can often only see them when they move which may well be why they escaped notice so long.’","Guerrilla spider was spotted by National Autonomous University of Mexico .

"Duets featuring Michael Jackson and Freddie Mercury are finally set to be officially released, three decades after they were recorded. Mercury’s former bandmates, Brian May and Roger Taylor, are working on tracks featuring the two dead superstars and have promised ‘something for folks to hear’ in two months. Guitarist May described working on the sessions this month as: ‘Exciting, challenging, emotionally taxing. But cool.’ Showmen: Duets featuring Michael Jackson and Freddie Mercury are finally set to be officially released, three decades after they were recorded. The pair are pictured in 1980 . The prospect of pop’s two greatest showmen combining in a musical reprise is a mouth-watering prospect for fans around the world. Yet ironically the pair fell out after a collaboration in the early 1980s. In what is thought to have been their only session together, they recorded three songs during six hours spent at Jackson’s home studio in Encino, California. In 2011, May confirmed the Jackson estate had given permission for him to revamp the trio of recordings with Taylor and the pair have brought in US-based music producer William Orbit, who has worked with Madonna and Blur.

The tracks are likely to include new guitar solos from May along with Queen-style vocal harmonies. Writing on his blog in reply to a fan, May, 66, said: ‘There are a few items in progress. We will have something for folks to hear in a couple of months’ time, hopefully.’ Jackson died in 2009, aged 50, after suffering cardiac arrest linked to his drug dependency. Mercury died from an Aids-related illness, aged 45, in 1991. A Jackson family source said he believed the post-Encino row stemmed from the pair’s inability to arrange a second recording session.","Mercury’s former bandmates Brian May .

"A teenager who was accidentally switched at birth has revealed how the hospital mix-up ripped her family apart. Manon Serrano, 18, was swapped with another baby five days after being born at the Cannes-la-Bocca clinic in France on July 4, 1994. Ms Serrano and her family eventually discovered the maternity ward mistake after undergoing DNA tests eight years ago - but not before it tore her family apart. New mother: Sophie Serrano, pictured shortly after giving birth at the age of 18, discovered her daughter had been accidentally switched at birth ten years after the event . For the first time, Ms Serrano has revealed how the man she believed to be her father was convinced that she wasn't his. This was because Ms Serrano, whose real parents are from Réunion Island, in the Indian Ocean, was dark-skinned while Mr Serrano and his wife were both fair skinned. A paternity test in 2002 proved his suspicions and he left his wife believing she must have conceived the child with another man. Another test two years later revealed that Mrs Serrano was not her mother. Ms Serrano says the mistake has had a huge impact on her life and left her struggling to find her own identity. She added: 'At a period of your life when you're anyway asking questions, me, I had lost my identity.' Family torn apart: Sophie Serrano's husband left her when paternity tests proved he was not the father of their daughter Manon. Two years later, further tests showed she was not the biological mother either . Maternity ward: While the Cannes-la-Bocca Clinic, in Cannes, France, admits the error occurred, it claims the mothers should have realised their babies had been switched . The rest of her family have also struggled to come to terms with the mistake. Her 'mother' Mrs Serrano, from Thorenc, near Grasse, in southern France, told Le Parisien: 'The sky fell on my head. I had the impression that I had lost the daughter I had brought up, but I was also seized by a terrible anguish.' Mrs Serrano, who has two other children, told the newspaper she suffered from nervous depression in the aftermath of the discovery and lost her business. Trial: Mrs Serrano suffered from nervous depression after she discovered the daughter she raised from birth was not biologically hers . 'I lost everything. We had to leave our home, I have got big debts. All my children had to consult psychologists,' she admitted'. The accidental switch happened when Ms Serrano was placed in a cot with another baby for treatment for jaundice. Ms Serrano was then given back to Sophie Serrano, whose own daughter was handed to another woman. Mrs Serrano told nurses that the child did not look like her own baby, but nurses insisted that there had been no mistake. After the DNA tests eight years ago revealed that Ms Serrano was infact not her daughter, police managed to track down the other family involved in the mix-up and the two families met. Mrs Serrano said: 'There was a mixture of trouble, joy and sadness. 'I fell into the arms of my biological daughter. Instinctively I loved her. But in the long term, I was able to find a place for myself.' Despite the discovery, both girls decided to stay with the families who brought them up. Ms Serrano said: 'When my mother told me of the switch, my first thought was am I going to have to leave my family? I would have felt empty without them.' Mrs Serrano is suing the clinic, which has since become a retirement home. Maître Claude Chas, a lawyer for the clinic, admitted that an error had occurred but said the mothers should have noticed that their babies had been switched.
