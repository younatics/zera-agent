"A North Carolina man who used to work for Al Sharpton has claimed that his former boss met an undercover agent posing as a drug dealer three times. Robert Curington revealed the background to how he says Sharpton fell for the FBI trap in 1983, and claims the preacher was motivated by greed. The 72-year-old, who was convicted of drug charges in the 1970s, made his claims to the New York Post after it was revealed this week that Sharpton had been an FBI informant. Denial: Al Sharpton says allegations that he met an undercover agent to discuss a drug deal three times are unfounded . Curington was working for Sharpton's National Youth Movement in the 1980s at the time of the FBI sting, which was caught on camera. Sharpton claimed this week he only showed an an interest in the proposed drug deal because he feared for his life. He said that he had been threatened by mobsters who felt that he was competing for their handle on the music industry. Curington wasn't at the meetings with the undercover agent posing as a drug dealer wanting to traffick coke, but he claims that Sharpton met the man three times. He told the Post that the first meeting with the agent, using the undercover name of Victor Quintana, was at the New York boxing office of Don King in 1983. The agent had set up a meeting with King to discuss a boxing match in the Bahamas, but Curington says King was suspicious and instead arranged for him to meet Sharpton. 'King was sly - he knew something was . off about this. So he kept him downstairs and let his . new best friend Al Sharpton talk to him,' Curington claimed. On tape: Footage shows Al Sharpton in a cowboy hat unknowingly meeting an undercover FBI agent in 1983 . Claims: New reports suggest these taped undercover videos were used to get Sharpton to agree to work as a paid informant . He added that Sharpton 'would spend cash taking him to dinner and . chauffeur him around in a limo, feeling him out'. While the pair were out to dinner the agent allegedly suddenly said: 'I know where 10 kilos of cocaine are and we can make some big money on this.' Curington claimed that Sharpton was accompanied by an adviser who intervened, saying: 'Hold it. This meeting is over. You come in here talking about boxing and now you're gonna talk about cocaine? Let's go.' Curington wasn't at the restaurant with the men but he claims Sharpton was reluctant to leave. A second meeting was set up, this time at a hotel, and again when cocaine was mentioned Sharpton's advisers called off the meeting and left. But Curington claims Sharpton set up a third unaccompanied meeting, images of which were leaked from FBI surveillance tapes in 2002 which showed him wearing a cowboy hat. High profile: The Rev Al Sharpton, center, leads a march to the New York Mayor's residence in 1988 . Curington alleged that Sharpton was told he would get $3,500 per kilo and, when he 'moved on it, they spring the trap on him right away'. 'Al told me himself. He bit and took the bait,' Curington told the Post. 'Sharpton said they could do whatever . they wanted with him after that. Because they had him. 'Either he worked for them or they put that news out there that he was . into coke.' He added: 'I said, ""Why are you talking to these types of people?"" He was just greedy. It was all for money.' On Friday Sharpton denied that he had attended three meetings with the agent, when cocaine was discussed. 'Bob Curington is blatantly wrong,' he said. Sharpton also denied claims by his former employee that he took cocaine.","Robert Curington alleges his former boss had three meetings with agent .

"The mummified body of Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun burst into flames inside his sarcophagus after a botched attempt to embalm him, according to scientists in a new documentary. After his death in 1323 BC, Tutankhamun was rapidly embalmed and buried, but fire investigators believe a chemical reaction caused by embalming oils used on his mummy sparked the blaze. A fragment of flesh from the boy pharaoh, whose tomb was discovered in 1922 by Howard Carter and the Earl of Carnarvon, was tested by researchers who confirmed his body was burnt while sealed in his coffin. Fire: Tutankhamun burst into flame inside his sarcophagus because of a chemical reaction from the chemicals he was embalmed with . Researchers confirmed his body was burnt while sealed in his coffin after testing a fragment of his flesh . Tut has long fired the public imagination. He became pharaoh at the age of 10 in 1333 BC and ruled for just nine years until his death. He was the last of the royal line from the eighteenth dynasty of the New Kingdom, one of the most powerful royal houses of ancient Egypt. The discovery of his nearly intact tomb, complete with a gold coffin and gold funeral mask, was a worldwide sensation and sparked public interest in ancient Egypt. Engulfed: This picture shows the boy king's charred feet . Echoes of history: A mummy tissue sample of Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun . Stunning treasure was found in his tomb, including an 24.2lb solid gold death mask encrusted with lapis lazuli and semi-precious stones. Egyptologist Dr Chris Naunton examined Carter's original notes and also carried out a virtual autopsy of the body using X-ray and CT scanning technology and now believes Tutankhamun was killed in a chariot crash in battle. Dr Naunton said: 'Although the death mask and other treasures are very familiar, a staggering amount of the evidence has been overlooked. It's amazing how many questions have not even really been asked let alone answered.' Tut was the last of the royal line from the eighteenth dynasty of the New Kingdom, one of the most powerful royal houses of ancient Egypt . The true face of power: This reconstructed image of King Tutankhamun was created by Egyptian historians and the National Geographic Society. Pictured right is Howard Carter, who discovered the Pharaoh's tomb in 1922 . Fascination: Tut has long fired the public imagination. He became pharaoh at the age of 10 in 1333 BC and ruled for just nine years until his death . He added: 'Despite all the attention Tut's mummy . has received over the years the full extent of its strange condition . has largely been overlooked. 'The . charring and possibility that a botched mummification led to the body . spontaneously combusting shortly after burial was entirely unexpected, . something of a revelation in fact. 'I think what the project shows is that . when it comes to ancient material there is always more to learn, and . there probably will be in the future, but with this study we have taken a . big step forward in terms of understanding what happened at the end of . Tut's life.' Tutankhamun: The Mystery Of The Burnt Mummy will be screened on Channel 4 on November 10. Not only did his skeleton have broken ribs but it was lacking a sternum, breastbone, and heart . Dr Naunton used the latest technology to reconstruct the death of the pharaoh and now believes a high-speed chariot crash was the cause of his death. He said: ‘We believe there is now a very distinct possibility that he was struck by a chariot wheel in the torso at high speed – enough to do him very serious damage. In fact, that’s what killed him. ‘His body would have been a real mess – he would not have been left a little bloodied – and that would have given the embalmers a real problem. They were used to dealing with dead bodies, not mangled ones.’ In 1968, a photographer from Liverpool University took 50 X-rays of the mummy. It was found that a chunk of Tutankhamun’s skull had floated loose, leading to four decades of murder theories. But now it is believed that the head injury was caused after his death and that the clues to his demise lie in his chest. Not only did his skeleton have broken ribs on its left-hand side but it was lacking a sternum, or breastbone, and heart. A fragment of the pharaoh’s flesh was also examined. After discovering that Tutankhamun had not been murdered, Dr Naunton asked forensic experts to carry out further research – and it was revealed that King Tut’s injuries were consistent with being run over by a heavy, narrow wheel of the type used on chariots.","The Egyptian boy pharaoh 'burst into flame after chemical reaction'

"Dr Craig Spencer lied to police about travelling around New York for six days before he was quarantined with Ebola, it has been claimed . The doctor currently being treated for Ebola in New York lied to police about travelling around the city for six days before he was quarantined, it has been revealed. Dr Craig Spencer initially told officers that he had isolated himself in his Harlem apartment after returning from Guinea where he had been treating people for the illness. It was only when cops checked his MetroCard and bank statement that they realised he had been roaming the city for nearly a week, visiting a sandwich shop, taking an Uber cab, and going bowling. It was only when officers rang Dr Spencer and confronted him with the evidence that he confessed, according to the New York Post. Dr Spencer is a Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontiers) volunteer who went to Guinea to help fight Ebola on September 16. He spent a month working in treatment centres in close contact with sufferers, before flying to Brussels on October 14. After a three-day layover, he landed at JFK Airport on October 17. He was screened for Ebola on arrival, but reported no symptoms and tests did not detect a trace of the deadly virus. On October 21 he first reported feeling fatigued, but as he had no fever, vomiting, or diarrhea, he carried on with life as normal. Over the next two days he rode the A and L train, visited The Meatball Shop restaurant, went running, played a game of bowling at The Gutter alley, and rode around in an Uber cab. It was only on October 23 that he began to feel feverish, at which point he called Medecins Sans Frontiers who informed the New York Health Department. He was immediately quarantined. Scroll down for video . Dr Spencer is a Doctors Without Borders volunteer and travelled to Guinea in September in order to help treat those suffering from Ebola . He returned to New York on October 17 and reported feeling fatigued, but it was not until October 23 when he began feeling feverish that he was put in isolation at Bellevue Hospital (pictured) Yesterday Bellevue Hospital, where he is being treated, reported that he is in a 'serious but stable' condition after being given blood from Ebola survivor Nancy Writebol. New York health and hospitals corporation president Dr. Ram Raju said: 'This morning I talked to our patient and his doctors and nurses at Bellevue Hospital Center. 'The patient looks better than he looked yesterday, but he remains in serious but stable condition with the expected symptoms of the virus. 'He tolerated the plasma treatment well and had a good night sleep.' On Friday night, the 33-year-old received a blood donation from aid worker Nancy Writebol, who survived the virus, after tests found they shared the same blood type. It is a move that medics believe could save his life after Ebola survivors Nina Pham, Amber Jay Vinson, Ashoka Mukpo and Dr Nick Sacra were all cured following blood transfusions. During the six days in which Dr Spencer roamed around the city, he rode the subway, used an Uber taxi, and visited this restaurant - but initially lied and told police he had stayed at home, it has been reported . The day before Dr Spencer was isolated with Ebola, he visited The Gutter bowling alley (pictured) Writebol contracted Ebola while working with Christian aid group SIM in Liberia with her husband, who is also a missionary. They were working with their close friend Dr Kent Brantley, who also contracted the disease and was later cured. Symptoms of Ebola include a fever, a headache, diarrhea, vomiting, muscle and joint aches and in some cases bleeding. These appear two to 21 days after exposure to the disease, the CDC said. Even if a person is infected, the virus can only be passed on once symptoms appear. It is transmitted through direct contact with the infected person's bodily fluids. Dr Spencer initially told authorities he had isolated himself in this apartment on 546 West 147th Street in Manhattan, which he shares with fiancee Morgan Dixon . After Dr Spencer was quarantined, Hazmat teams visited his apartment with barrels in order to take away potentially infected items .

October 22: At around 1:00 PM, Dr Spencer went running along Riverside Drive and Westside Highway. Around 2:00 PM, he went to pick up Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) farm share at 143rd St and Amsterdam Avenue (Corbin Hill Farm) and picked up a box which he took to his apartment. At around 5:30 PM, Dr Spencer left for The Gutter bowling alley in Williamsburg, Brooklyn with two friends. For his arrival at Gutter, he took the A train at 145th Street and transferred at 14th Street and took the L train to Bedford Avenue. Around 8:30 PM, Dr Spencer left The Gutter.

It is often claimed that women are better at multi-tasking and the effort by the woman in this video to carry her dog with one hand while climbing up a ladder are truly remarkable. The brave and determined woman grits her teeth and climbs up from the steep Thames Embankment on a ladder near Kew after rescuing her stranded dog who had slipped down a huge distance. The resolute woman can first be seen trying to beckon her dog towards her but he appears to be slightly disorientated having wandered down to the narrow walkway at the bottom. The woman then picks her dog up and begins to climb the long steep ladder while two of her friends wait at the top of the ladder on the towpath and try to encourage her. The hazardous climb is not without risk and the woman slows down on a number of occasions as she tries to hold her dog tightly while navigating the awkward steps. After two minutes of hard work the woman nears the top of the ladder and one of her friend's in a navy jacket willingly descends four or five steps to take her dog from her.

"A stressful job and lifestyle could damage a person's short-term memory in old age, scientists have warned. A study at the University of Iowa has found a potential link between a hormone and short-term memory loss in older people. It revealed that having high levels in cortisol - a natural hormone in the body, which increases when a person is stressed - can lead to memory lapses as a person ages. High levels of the stress hormone cortisol can increase the risk of short-term memory loss in old age, researchers have warned . Short-term increases in cortisol levels are vital for survival. The hormone allows a person to cope, helping the body to respond to life's challenges by making it more alert and allowing a person to think on their feet. But abnormally high or prolonged spikes in cortisol, which can happen when a person is dealing with long-term stressful situations, can lead to digestion problems, anxiety, weight gain and high blood pressure, studies have shown. Jason Radley, an assistant psychology professor at the University of Iowa, said: 'Stress hormones are one mechanism that we believe leads to weathering of the brain. 'Like a rock on the shoreline, after years and years it will eventually break down and disappear.' Scientists linked the raised levels of cortisol to the gradual loss of synapses in the prefrontal cortex, the region of the brain that houses short-term memory. Synapses are the connections that help the brain process, store and recall information. As a person ages, repeated and long-term exposure to cortisol, can cause synapses to shrink and disappear. While previous research has shown . cortisol produces similar affects in other regions of the ageing brain, . this is the first study to examine its impact on the prefrontal cortex, . the university said. Researchers discovered prolonged exposure to high levels of the hormone affected the prefrontal cortex of the brain, which is responsible for short-term memory . Although . the results are preliminary findings, scientists said they could . provide the basis for research into how short-memory decline in ageing . adults could be slowed or prevented. The study, published in the Journal of Neuroscience,  could also raise the possibility of finding treatments that reduce cortisol levels in susceptible individuals. It could mean treating people who have naturally high levels of cortisol, including those who are depressed, or those who experience repeated, long-term stress due to traumatic life events, such as the death of a loved one. The study found short-term memory lapses linked to high levels of cortisol begin to affect a person around the age of 65. But researchers warned that it is important to remember that stress hormones are only one of a host of factors which affect mental decline and memory loss as a person ages.","Study at the University of Iowa found link between high levels of stress hormone cortisol and lapses in short-term memory in old age .

"Millionaire fashion designer Dame Vivienne Westwood has suggested families who can’t afford to buy organic food should simply ‘eat less’. She was delivering a petition to Downing Street outlining concerns about genetically modified crops. But when she was challenged by a BBC Radio 5Live reporter who said ‘not everybody can afford to eat organic food’, the 73-year-old replied they should stop eating so much. However, she softened her tone when it was suggested that eating less isn’t an option for the poorest. Scroll down for video . Millionaire fashion designer Dame Vivienne Westwood (pictured at theNetflix documentary screening of 'Virunga') has suggested families who can’t afford to buy organic food should simply ‘eat less’ She replied: ‘They don’t have any choice – this is the point. You’ve got all these processed foods, which is the main reason people are getting fat. ‘I eat vegetables and fruit. I don’t eat meat. I believe meat is bad for me so I don’t eat it. It’s also bad for the animals. ‘If there was a movement to produce more organic food and less of the horrible food, then organic food would obviously be a good value price.’ The comments were immediately criticised online. One Twitter user said she ‘totally fails to understand people in the UK are struggling to pay their bills’. Another said: ‘Lower orders & peasants have a duty to starve, says “anti-capitalist” champagne socialist.’ Dame Vivienne said: ‘I’m deeply upset if anyone would think I don’t care about starving people or don’t understand the terrible situation some people are in, quite the opposite, I have spent years campaigning for social and human rights issues. 'My comments were related to eating less meat. People are eating far too much factory farmed meat and junk food which is bad for you and not providing the nutrients you need. You can source good food and organic farmed meat for less.’ It is not the first time the designer, who is thought to have a fortune of at least £10million, has sparked outrage with similar controversial views. Shortly before the Scottish independence referendum in September, Dame Westwood she said she ‘hates England’. Miss Westwood lives in a smart townhouse in Clapham, south London . Last month she said that ‘clothes should cost more’, adding: ‘Food should cost more too. Something is wrong when you can buy a cooked chicken for £2.’ Despite making her fortune from selling clothes, she added: ‘Fashion is a terrible thing, it’s all about tempting to buy. But they should buy less.’ Shortly before the Scottish independence referendum in September, Dame Westwood she said she ‘hates England’, adding: ‘I like Scotland because somehow I think they are better than we are. They are more democratic.’ In March, she was criticised by campaigners after she said that eating vegetarian food can cure disabled people. And two years ago, she said the people of Britain ‘have never looked to ugly’, adding: Everybody looks like clones and the only people you notice are my age. ‘I don’t notice anybody unless they look great, and every now and again they do, and they are usually 70. ‘We are so conformist, nobody is thinking. We are all sucking up stuff, we have been trained to be consumers and we are all consuming far too much.’ Miss Westwood lives in a smart townhouse in Clapham, south London with her husband Andreas Kronthaler, who is 25 years her junior. She recently revealed they share their bathwater, saying: ‘Normally at home I’m not used to the habit of a shower.

"If glowing patient testi-monials are . anything to go by, the Veinwave ‘zapper’ can work near-miracles. Manufacturers promise the device, which emits microwaves, can instantly . erase unsightly thread veins on the face and body. Yet . the stock treatment given in skin clinics for these troublesome . blemishes is laser therapy. This  is potentially uncomfortable, with . weeks of bruising and scabbing commonly seen afterwards, and  it often . doesn’t completely solve  the problem. Veinwave, on the other hand, causes little more than a slight redness which fades after a few hours. Vanishing act: A patient's nose before treatment, left, where microwaves are targeted at the red veins in short bursts, and after treatment, right . Thanks . largely to word-of-mouth, Dr Newmans Clinics, which offer the . treatment, has seen more than 2,000 patients, a third of whom had other . types of thread vein removal without success. It begs the question: If . Veinwave works, why isn’t it offered by all doctors? Like . so many medical discoveries, Veinwave was a happy side effect of a . different investigation. In 1998, consultant vascular surgeon Dr Brian . Newman was pursuing a treatment for cellulite – testing the premise that . stimulating the skin with microwaves might reduce the dimpling effect. It didn’t, but he noticed that small thread veins were vanishing from . patients’ legs. Today, the treatment is offered at Dr Newmans Clinic in Central  London and three other branches nationwide. Yet . aside from gaining a patent for his technology, Dr Newman has carried . out no trials or published any research. As a result, few medics seem to . have even heard of it, let alone recommend it. Thread . veins – also known as spider veins (the medical term is telangiectasia) – are simply veins which are visible below the skin. There is a genetic . link, so you  may have a predisposition to them, and incidence . increases with age, smoking and sun exposure. ‘People . get incredibly distressed about these blemishes on their faces,’ says . Dr Peter Finigan, Medical Director of Dr Newmans Clinic. ‘Men in . particular feel that they look like alcoholics as they tend to develop . chunky veins on their noses. But often they don’t drink.’ No laughing matter: Comedian W.C. Fields was famous for his red nose . So . just what is this treatment? ‘Microwaves are simply high frequency . radiowaves. These are emitted from the fine needle that constitutes the . tip of the device,’ explains Dr Finigan. ‘The short, sharp bursts of heat – pulsing every 0.2 of a second –  are directed at the wall of the offending vein.’ While the skin surface isn’t heated, these short bursts cause the protein within the wall to coagulate. ‘It’s like heating up egg white,’ says Dr Finigan. ‘The protein becomes sticky and seals off the vein. As it is the blood giving the thread vein its red colour, once it cannot flow through there, the redness vanishes.’ The needle is used to track the vein across the face every one or two millimetres. The feeling is that of a tiny pinprick and no anaesthetic is needed. Over the next few days the body reabsorbs the redundant vein wall. And although there are no formal clinical trials, Jean Marc Chardonneau, a French aesthetic doctor in Nantes, conducted a successful 2004 study into the effects of thermocoagulation using a similar machine on telangiectasia on the leg with 50 patients. ‘We see hundreds of patients a year. I’d say that all of them are very happy with their results,’ says Dr Finigan. ‘About 40 per cent come back for further treatment at some stage. We aren’t re-treating the same veins, but new ones which have accumulated over the years.’ In one per cent of patients, redness may take a few days to dissipate. But the videos on the clinic’s website are extraordinary – as the minute tip of the instrument touches the veins they simply vanish. So what of the other options for thread veins? Most doctors recommend Intense Pulsed Light (IPL), a device that emits light waves to destroy red veins. Treatment costs from £500, and results could be described as modest. A large scale study into IPL for facial telangiectasia concluded that patients had a 30 per cent reduction in the veins’ appearance. And IPL is limited in that it can only be used on fair skin. Another option is pulsed dye laser. Jo Martin, of Nottingham’s Mapperley Park Clinic, says: ‘With the modern pulsed dye laser, people tend not to have any bruising, although older models cause dark bruises, which can be unsightly and take over a week to settle.’ Finally, sclerotherapy is the injection of a substance into thread veins, which causes damage to cell walls and causes the vessel to shrink over a few weeks. It is generally more appropriate for leg veins. ‘We find microsclerotherapy much more effective for treating legs but less so on the face,’ says vascular surgeon Dr John Scurr. Professor Nick Lowe at London’s Cranley Clinic, who was given a demonstration of Veinwave, adds: ‘I would treat the whole face with IPL or pulsed dye laser and consider Veinwave for remaining veins.’ The problem is, say experts, without proper research the overall effectiveness of the microwave zapper is unknown. And so, those who have it are essentially guinea pigs. ‘We’re aware of Veinwave, but I don’t recommend it,’ says Dr Scurr. ‘They have to come up with real hard proof.’ Veinwave from £395, drnewmansclinic.co.uk .

"It's the superhuman suit that will turn special operations commandos into real-life Iron Men. The U.S. military is developing a new uniform for troops that will be bullet-proof, enhance the wearer's strength, heal wounds by temporarily stopping bleeding and display the soldier's vital signs. A prototype of the Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit, or TALOS - named after the mythological Greek automaton made of bronze that Zeus assigned to protect his lover Europa - is expected to hit the market next year. Scroll down for video . Iron man: Army researchers are developing an advanced military uniform - the Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit - to deliver 'superhuman strength with greater ballistic protection' to soldiers . The Army said the revolutionary armor will deliver 'superhuman strength with greater ballistic protection' by providing a . powered exoskeleton to haul heavier equipment, built-in computers and the ability to apply wound-sealing foam. The capabilities would make the already elite Special . Operation Forces nearly invincible in the field. '[The] requirement is a comprehensive family of systems in a combat armor suit where we bring together an exoskeleton with innovative armor, displays for power monitoring, health monitoring, and integrating a weapon into that — a whole bunch of stuff that RDECOM is playing heavily in,' Lt. Col. Karl Borjes, a U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM) science adviser, said in a statement. MIT engineers are working on a liquid body armor that 'transforms from liquid to solid in milliseconds when a magnetic field or electrical current is applied'. Super human: The Army-commissioned 'TALOS' will  protect commandos from gunfire, enhance their strength and give them night vision . The U.S. Special Operations Command is teaming up with industry, universities and laboratories to see if such a suit can be created for the real world of combat. 'I’m very committed to this,' U.S. Special Operations Command chief Adm. William McRaven to a group of industry representatives at a TALOS presentation in July, according to wired.com. 'I’d like that last operator that we lost to be the last operator we lose in this fight or the fight of the future, and I think we can get there.' The high number of extremely technical and integrated challenges means the Army will draw on a broad range of collaborators from backgrounds that may have never worked together. 'USSOCOM is interested in receiving white papers from a wide variety of sources, not just traditional military industry but also from academia, entrepreneurs, and laboratories capable of providing the design, construction, and testing of TALOS related technologies,' said Jim Geurts, USOCOM acquisition executive, in a statement. 'The intent is to accelerate the delivery of innovative TALOS capabilities to the SOF operator.' Brought to life: The technology seen in the 'Iron Man' movies will be reflected in the new attire of the United States military . However, not everyone is enamored with the idea of super-advanced body suits for soldiers. 'My sense is it is an up-armored Pinocchio,' Scott Neil, a retired special forces master sergeant and Silver Star recipient, told the Tampa Tribune. 'Now the commander can shove a monkey in a suit and ask us to survive a machine gun, IED [improvised explosive device] and poor intelligence all on the same objective. 'And when you die in it, as it melds to your body, you can bury them in it.' Others have criticized the absence of a power source in the sci-fi suit. 'The acronym TALOS was chosen deliberately,' MIT professor Gareth McKinley told NPR. 'It's the name of the bronze armored giant from 'Jason and the Argonauts.' Like all good superheroes, Talos has one weakness. For the Army's TALOS, the weak spot is either the need to carry around a heavy pump for a hydraulic system, or lots of heavy batteries. We don't have Iron Man's power source yet.' The Army hopes to have a prototype ready next year, with various components of the suit currently in development, according to NBC News. However an advanced model won't be developed until at least 2016.","US Army has commissioned Iron Man-style 'Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit' for commandos .

"Time travel and teleportation are staples in many sci-fi films, such as Star Trek. But some physicists say they will likely become possible before the end of this century. While time travel may be the most ambitious feat of engineering, they say that it might be possible by 2100, while space tourism and invisibility cloaks will probably become available within just 15 years. Scroll down for video . It's about time: British physicists claim that time travel - as seen in the Back to the Future film (a still of the time-travelling DeLorean is pictured) - might be possible by 2100, while space tourism and invisibility cloaks will probably become available within just 15 years . Physicists from Imperial College London and the University of Glasgow predicted when ‘sci-fi technologies’ as seen in Star Trek, Star Wars, Back to the Future and Harry Potter will probably become scientific fact during the lifetimes of current school children. In research among a panel of top UK scientists and a study of 11-16 year olds commissioned by The Big Bang Fair, scientists said that teleportation could become a daily activity by 2080. The children polled thought time travel, which is seen in Back to the Future, might be possible 63 years from now, but scientists were not quite so optimistic. Colin Stuart, author of The Big Questions in Science, estimates humans will be able to jump ahead to see our future by 2100 – just 85 years away. To boldly go: Teleportation, as seen in Star Trek (pictured) could become a regular occurrence by 2080, according to Dr Mary Jacquiline Romero of University of Glasgow. 'The good thing about teleportation is that there is no fundamental law telling us that it cannot be done,' she said . Physicists have come up with predictions of when technology seen in films such as Back to the Future, Star Trek, Harry Potter and Star Wars will become a reality. Time travel: By 2100 . Teleportation: By 2080 . Invisibility cloaks: By 2030 . Personal space travel: By 2015 . ‘Time travel to the future has already been achieved, but only in tiny amounts,’ he said. ‘The record is 0.02 seconds set by cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev. While that doesn't sound too impressive, it does show that time travel to the future is possible and that the amount of time travel couldn't be far greater. ‘If you travelled through space on a big loop at 10 per cent the speed of light for what seemed to you like six months, approximately six months and one day would have passed on Earth. ‘You'd have time travelled a day into the future. Travel at the same speed for 10 years and you'll time travel nearly three weeks into the future. ‘I would say we are looking at 2100 as a very optimistic timescale for travelling weeks into the future.’ Teleportation however, which is a key feature in Star Trek, could become a regular occurrence by 2080, according to Dr Mary Jacquiline Romero from the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Glasgow. The end is in sight: We may get our hands on Harry Potter-style invisibility cloaks and be able to go on holiday in space in just 15 years’ time. Scientists have developed many different invisibility technologies, but have yet to fashion a fabric cloak. This device aligns four lenses in a certain manner to make an object 'invisible' A vision of the future: Chris Phillips of Imperial College London said: ‘With developments such as 3D printing allowing us to create previously impossible materials, it’s entirely feasible that we could see a Harry Potter-like invisibility cloak within the next 10 to 20 years’ A still from the film featuring the extraordinary cloak is pictured . Colin Stuart, author of The Big Questions in Science, estimates humans will be able to jump ahead to see our future by 2100 – 85 years away. ‘Time travel to the future has already been achieved, but only in tiny amounts,’ he said. ‘The record is 0.02 seconds set by cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev.

Travel at the same speed for 10 years and you'll time travel nearly three weeks into the future. ‘I would say we are looking at 2100 as a very optimistic timescale for travelling weeks into the future.’ The polled children were just two years out, predicting this will happen in 63 years. ‘Teleporting a person, atom by atom, will be very difficult…but perhaps developments in chemistry or molecular biology will allow us to do it more quickly,’ she explained. ‘The good thing about teleportation is that there is no fundamental law telling us that it cannot be done and with technical advances I would estimate teleportation that we see in the films will be with us by 2080.’ She said that physicists have achieved reliable teleportation, but it has only been done with electrons so far. ‘To put this into perspective when thinking about human teleportation, an atom can have many electrons and a person is made of billions of atoms,’ she said. However, we may get our hands on Harry Potter-style invisibility cloaks and be able to go on holiday in space in just 15 years’ time. Chris Phillips, Professor of Experimental Solid State Physics at Imperial College London said: ‘One way to create an “invisibility cloak” is to use adaptive camouflage, which involves taking a film of the background of an object or person and projecting it onto the front to give the illusion of vanishing. ‘We’re actually not that far away from this becoming a reality – rudimentary technology versions of this have already been created – but the main problem is that the fibre-like structures in the adaptive camouflage need to be so tightly woven that it’s incredibly labour intensive. Up up and away: The panel of school children predicted that it will take another 30 years’ time before they will be able to holiday in space. However, commercial space flights are expected to blast off in 2015 with Virgin Galactic offering suborbital flights (illustrated) ‘With developments such as 3D printing allowing us to create previously impossible materials, it’s entirely feasible that we could see a Harry Potter-like invisibility cloak within the next 10 to 20 years.’ The panel of school children surveyed dramatically underestimated when they might be able to be tourists in space, believing that it will take another 30 years’ time before this becomes a feature of their lives. However, commercial space flights are expected to blast off in 2015 with Virgin Galactic offering suborbital flights. SpaceShipTwo is projected to fly to a height of 68miles (110km), going beyond the defined boundary of space 62miles (100 km) and lengthening the experience of weightlessness for its passengers. Paul Jackson, CEO of Engineering UK, said: ‘The amazing and seemingly impossible things they see in films and television is acting as a stimulant for young people to think about what they could be capable of doing in the future. ‘Almost a fifth of young people surveyed said they dream of becoming a lightsaber developer and 22 per cent want to be a teleporting instructor. ‘More than a quarter even said they would consider a career as a time travel engineer, so we will need to think carefully about how we could provide useful careers advice for that 27 per cent.’ The Big Bang Fair is the UK’s largest celebration of science and engineering for young people, and aim is to inspire the of scientists.

"A great deal of Americans were justifiably upset when Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney lost the election. But rather than using social media to express their frustration and disappointment in an elegant way, many Twitter users instead used the platform to post shockingly racist tweets, calling President Obama a ‘n*****’ and a ‘monkey.’ A map collected by Floating Sheep, a collective of geography academics, shows the shocking demographic of racist 'hate tweets,' many of them collected from states that were won by Romney. Vitriol: Floating Sheep mapped out racist tweets about Obama across the country, starting on November 1; Arkansas and Mississippi had the highest concentration of such tweets . Look back in anger: Another Twitter user tweeted his thoughts . Profanity: Another Twitter user wrote that Americans were a bunch of 'G** d*** n***** lovers' Popular vote: Many of the racist tweets came from heavily Republican areas that were won by Romney . The majority of the tweets, as Jezebel noted, were often from young white residents in southern states. MailOnline has chosen not to name these social media users. One male user wrote on Election Day following Romney’s loss: ‘Ok we pick a worthless n***** over a full blooded American what the h*** has our world come its (sic) called the white house for a reason.’ Another wrote: ‘F*** you, Obama. Your (sic) a stupid n***** and you don’t do anything good for our country.’ Using geodata called DOLLY (Data On Local Life and You), Floating Sheep mapped out tweets beginning November 1. They then calculated the percentage of each state’s so-called hate tweets in relation to the gross number of tweets coming out of that state. Their results showed that states like Arkansas and Mississippi were relatively inundated with racist tweets. However, they measured only the quantity of tweets, noting that a lone Twitter user could be sending out dozens of vitriolic tweets all on their own, thus adding to the location-inspired measure, or LQ. The map also reveals other southern states like Tennessee, Georgia, and the Carolinas had their fair share of people tweeting bigoted things. Floating Sheep noted that both the East and West coast had a lower number of such tweets. Vigil: A crowd participates in a candlelit vigil titled 'We Are One Mississippi' at Ole Miss Wednesday night in response to the Election Day protests . Causality: The vigil was in response to protests that happened on campus after President Obama was re-elected as president . The site noted, too, that the phenomenon wasn’t only in the south – a series of racist tweets trickled up the Eastern Seaboard, and could also be found in Utah and Missouri. While it was not openly addressed by the candidates on the campaign trail, political pundits have insisted that demographics and race played a huge role in helping Obama keep the White House. On Election Day,  a riot broke out at The University of Mississippi - known as Ole Miss - as more than 400 students yelled out racial slurs and burned Obama-Biden campaign posters after the Democratic incumbent was crowned the victor. Emotions ran high among the angered college conservatives in Oxford, Mississippi, with university police being called in shortly after midnight to diffuse the crowd. Riots: Ole Miss students took to the streets, burning Obama campaign posters after his reelection was announced . Outrage: Students chronicled the demonstrations against Obama's win on social media . The incident began as a small gathering of frustrated voters, meeting to share their misery at Obama getting another four years in office, shortly after midnight. But word soon spread over social media and the crowd began to swell to hundreds of students, yelling out racial slurs, chanting anti-Obama rhetoric and some reportedly throwing rocks at cars. Police were called and told the crowd to go home but their presence only attracted more attention and the mass began to multiply. Two students were arrested in the fracas, . one for public intoxication and one for failure to comply with police . orders, the university confirmed. Disorder: Two students were arrested in the campus riot at the University of Mississippi in Oxford, Miss. on Tuesday night. An Ole Miss police officer escorts one student away from the protest . 'Disperse or go to jail,' University Police Department officers told the crowd, according to the student newspaper, The Daily Mississippian. But Ole Miss student Nicholas Carr tweeted that the whole thing was being overblown, saying that more people were taking pictures of the so-called riot than actually joining in on the chanting. 'I was there the whole time. No rocks were thrown. There was 1 sign lit on fire. For about 45 seconds,' Carr wrote. 'Mostly, . it was 100s of college kids who heard the word riot and ran to take . pictures and see what it was about. Again, no rocks or missiles thrown.' But the school's administration . confronted students on Wednesday and blasted Tuesday's behavior as 'a . very immature and uncivil approach to expressing their . views about the election,' University of Mississippi Chancellor Dan . Jones said in statement . 'The gathering seems to have been fueled by social media, and the conversation should have stayed there.'

"Arrest: Stephen Gough has been arrested walking naked through Hebden Bridge in West Yorkshire. He had only been released from prison three weeks ago . A man known as the 'Naked Rambler' has been arrested again - this time in the lesbian capital of Britain. Stephen Gough, 53, was detained as he strolled naked through Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, after a complaint from a member of the public. His arrest comes three weeks after he was released from Saughton Prison in Edinburgh, where he had served a six-month sentence for repeatedly breaching the peace. Gough, a former marine from Eastleigh in Hampshire, vowed to continue walking naked in his 'fight for freedom.' He crossed over into England and had . completed around 220 miles before his arrest on suspicion of breaching . the peace at around midday on Wednesday. Hebden Bridge earned the title of the . ‘lesbian capital of Britain’ for having the highest number of . homosexual women per head in the UK. Speaking as he set off from prison on . October 5, Gough said: 'I have no route or location in mind but my . plans are to head south basically. 'I have no idea if I’ll be arrested . again. I’ll just have to wait and see what happens. I’ll be fine in the . woods but when I get to a town there could be trouble. 'When I’m not walking and it’s cold I do wear my clothes to keep warm. 'But I’m going to sort out my clothes . from the carrier bags and put them in my rucksack and get on my way . naked. Hopefully the weather will stay warm.' Gough has spent most of the last six years in prison after being repeatedly jailed for breach of the peace. He was last jailed for five months after being seen unclothed near a children’s play park in Dunfermline, Fife, on July 20. But after being released he insisted . that it was his right to walk naked and said the threat of prison would . not deter him from being naked in public places. Hebden Bridge: The West Yorkshire town has a higher number of lesbian women per head than anywhere else in Britain . Dressed: Gough has vowed to keep walking in the nude in his 'fight for freedom' He said: 'I’ve been in prison so many times during my life - over 20 times I think for various things. 'They treated me just the same as always this time round, like any other prison. I was in solitary confinement again. 'But I do this because I want to. I . don’t know why the police and authorities have such a problem with it. I’m not hurting anybody. 'I want my freedom. But that’s the . way it works for people who fight for their freedom, they get locked up . for it. But I will continue to fight for freedom. 'There are a lot of totalitarian countries out there that people criticise but in some ways we aren’t much different.' Gough was held for a breach of the police and this morning released. But this morning he was arrested in Halifax having enjoyed just 25 minutes of freedom. He will return to Halifax Police Station on November 2. The town received the title after being found to have more lesbian people per head than anywhere else in the UK - including better known centres such as Brighton and Manchester. It boasts many businesses run . by, and aimed specifically at, the lesbian community - from dog walkers, decorators . and fashion to wine bars and hotels. The former mill town had been in steep decline until the 1970s when cheap housing attracted many people in search of alternative lifestyles - including artists and musicians. Many of those attracted to its growing 'bohemian' reputation included members of the gay and lesbian community who began to settle in the area. Sally Hines, director of the centre for interdisciplinary gender studies at the University of Leeds told the BBC that a 'progressive local government policy' towards supporting and financing LGBT [Lesbian Gay Bisexual and Transexual]-friendly initiatives,' were also an attraction to those who chose to live there. Once the town had an established gay and lesbian community - more people from those communities were attracted to living there. Similar patterns have been noted in other areas with strong gay and lesbian communities, including Brighton and Manchester.","Stephen Gough was caught strolling naked through Hebden Bridge .

Pryor, who is in a tight reelection battle, has publicly maintained an anti-gay-marriage stance in the red state in order to stay electable. 'I support traditional marriage, and I've been pretty clear on that for a long time,' Sen. Mark Pryor said in a May 31 news broadcast on KHBS-TV40 in the city of Fort Smith. But one of the state's prominent gay rights leaders told an undercover investigator with Project Veritas Action, a conservative group known for its 'gotcha' videos, that Pryor has assured gay marriage advocates he's on their side. 'If you tell anyone I told you that, I'm gonna find you, and I'll kill you,' the activist, Bailey Rae Bibb, says in the video after confiding in the hidden camera-wearing covert operative. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Bailey Bibb, who chairs the largest Young Democrats gay caucus group in Arkansas, said on a hidden camera that Sen. Mark Pryor has assured her he supports marriage equality for gays and lesbians . Bibb made it clear that she was telling the investigator, posing as the partner of a wealthy potential donor, something that wasn't common knowledge . NOT SO FAST: Pryor told an Arkansas TV news audience in May that ' I support traditional marriage, and I've been pretty clear on that for a long time' Bibb leads the Stonewall Caucus of the Young Democrats of Arkansas. She spoke to a man posing as a gay man who said his wealthy partner was considering making a large donation to support Pryor's reelection effort. 'I'm having some misgivings about it, given his marriage stance,' he tells her. Bibb replies while Pryor is 'not going to openly come out and say, ""Oh yeah, I support it"",'he changes his position 'if you ask him personally, just people-to-people.' Asked if she has personally had that conversation with the senator, Bibb explains, 'Oh, yeah,' adding that Pryor had told her 'I'm not against' gay marriage equality and that he is 'not going to outlaw it.' 'He said to a small group, like, ""Hey, you know, I’m not going to try to outlaw it, you know. I don’t think you should be discriminated against"",' Bibb says on camera. 'No, he’s not a bad person.' Bibb did not respond to phone, Facebook, SMS text and messages seeking comment. The Pryor campaign did not immediately respond to a request for clarification about the senator's position on gay marriage. Pryor's main opponent, Republican Rep. Tom Cotton, has not wavered from his anti-gay-marriage position. 'I believe that marriage is between one man and one woman,' he told KHBS in May. Cotton holds a 4.4 percentage-point lead in an average of recent polls, according to Real Clear Politics. Pryor's seat could be one of six the Republican Party needs to flip in order to cement control over both houses of Congress. Pryor is one of only a few Democratic senators – Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu and West Viginia Sen. Joe Manchin are the others – who publicly oppose a wave of state laws validating the right of gays and lesbians to legally marry. In red states, openly embracing a politically progressive position like marriage rights for gays and lesbians can spell doom for a Democratic candidate if Republicans make it the centerpiece of attack ads. Democratic Arkansas Governor Mike Beebe has also said publicly that he opposes gay marriage. Pryor spokesman Michael Teague told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette last year that the senator had a 'moral belief that marriage is between a man and a woman,' and believed that homosexuality is a choice and not an inborn trait of biology. Those positions are now ripe for speculation in the light of Wednesday's video exposé. Bibb, the Democratic activist, confirmed in a follow-up phone call what Pryor had said privately . Pryor (right) and his main opponent, Republican Rep. Tom Cotton (left) debated Monday night, but the gay marriage issue wasn't raised . Project Veritas Action founder James O'Keefe told MailOnline that in Arkansas, 'key workers, donors, supporters and elected officials have an expectation that their Democratic Senate candidates are lying in order to gain votes and it doesn't bother them one bit.' 'We are talking about a casual disregard for the truth from the grassroots all the way to the top.' His video includes a second admission from Paragould, Arkansas Mayor Mike Gaskill, that 'the sad thing about politics' in his home state is that 'people can't stand up and say what they really, really want to do and believe in.' O'Keefe is known for his take-no-prisoners sneak attacks and over-the-top video dramatizations. In one video this year, he staged a U.S. border infiltration by a man dressed in an Osama bin Laden costume, rolling video as the man waded across the Rio Grande from Mexico. In another he demonstrated how an Ebola-infected jihadi from the ISIS terror army could motorboat across Lake Erie from Canada without a challenge, and stroll into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. But it's his political hit pieces that generate the most media attention. In 2013 his operatives filmed wireless phone company employees passing out 'Obama phones,' free mobile phones paid for with U.S. tax dollars, to people who said they would sell them for drugs, shoes, handbags and spending cash. Last week O'Keefe released a surreptitiously made video showing supporters and staffers of Kentucky Democratic Senate hopeful Alison Lundergan Grimes saying that she was playing a 'lying game' by publicly supporting her state's coal industry. 'You know she has to say that,' one campaign staffer says on tape, 'because in Kentucky if you don’t support the coal industry you are dead.' Bailey Rae Bibb, chair of the Young Democrats of Arkansas Stonewall Caucus, is chummy with Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe – another red-state Democrat who says publicly that he opposes marriage rights for gays . PRIDE: The Stonewall Caucus is a politically active gay and lesbian group within Young Democrats for Arkansas, and its energetic liberal campaigners have the ear of progressive pols throughout the state . Gay rights has had a pendulum-like trajectory in Arkansas, one that provides hints to Sen. Pryor's leanings. Sodomy was illegal in Arkansas between its 1836 founding and the passage of a 1976 law decriminalizing it. One year later Pryor's father, then-Governor David Pryor, signed a second bill once again making the practice illegal, following a widely publicized case of two men engaging in oral sex in a Pulaski County, Arkansas 'drunk tank' holding cell. That law stood until 2002 when the Arkansas Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional. It was Sen. Pryor, then the state's attorney general, who made the decision to let the ruling stand and not appeal it to the U.S. Supreme Court. But he later conceded that in 2004 he voted against a statewide ballot initiative banning gay marriage. That measure passed, but was overturned in May 2014 by a state circuit judge. 'My position on that specifically is well-documented,' he said in video footage released days later by the conservative America Rising PAC, an opposition research group. 'That was a ballot initiative here in Arkansas ... I voted for the amendment to ban gay marriage in Arkansas.' As a senator, his recent record on gay rights has been a continuing study in U-turns. In 2010 Pryor stunned Arkansans with a flip-flop on the repeal of the Pentagon's 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy, a Bill Clinton-era directive that banned gay men and lesbians from serving openly in the military. 'On many previous occasions, I have said that I would oppose repeal,' he conceded, announcing his change of heart. Pryor is the latest in a long string of left-leaning US political candidates stung by hard-charging conservative video provocateur James O'Keefe . Mike Gaskill, Democratic mayor of the northeast Arkansas town of Paragould, told O'Keefe's undercover cameraman that politicians often can't be candid about their beliefs when votes are on the line . But a 2012 Senate bill proposing to ban discrimination against gays in federal workplaces has yet to receive his endorsement, despite co-sponsorships from all 52 of his fellow Senate Democrats, plus two Republicans and both independents. During the 2009-2010 congressional session, according to Project Vote Smart, Pryor enjoyed an 80 per cent positive rating from the Human Rights Campaign, America's most vocal gay rights policy group. Two years later his rating fell to 70 per cent. This year, as his electoral deadline approached, that rating stands at 60 per cent. If Bailey Bibb, the Young Democrats of Arkansas activist, is right, Pryor may soon swing back toward full agreement. 'If Baily Bibb is telling the truth, then Mark Pryor is lying,' O'Keefe says in his video. But for now, with Election Day less than three weeks away, the endangered Arkansas senator is sticking to his guns.","James O'Keefe, a conservative filmmaker known for guerrilla documentaries targeting liberals, sent a hidden camera into a recent Democratic fundraising event in Arkansas .

"A Sydney woman is facing criminal charges for selling faulty electrical cables which sparked a multimillion dollar national recall. Lu Luo imported the wires from China, according to News Corp, before selling them through 18 national suppliers and popular hardware stores including Masters Home Improvement, John Danks and Sons and Mitre 10. Her faulty product has led to the launch of a national task-force made up of consumer agencies, building regulators and electrical safety regulators who are working to locate and replace the cables in an estimated 40,000 homes and business across Australia before they cause a fire or severe electrocution. Lu Luo is facing criminal charges for supplying faulty electrical cables to national hardware suppliers . The cables have been recalled by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, a process that is expected to cost over $80 million, and Ms Luo's company, Infinity Cable Co, has gone into liquidation . Luo's company, Infinity Cable Co, has gone into liquidation and a recall was issued on August 27 for cables labelled 'INFINITY' and 'OLSENT' if they were sourced from the company. 'NSW Fair Trading can confirm it has commenced proceedings against Ms Lu Lou also known as Vid Luo in the summary criminal jurisdiction of the NSW Supreme Court for selling electrical articles in breach of the Electricity (Consumer Safety) Act 2004 (NSW). A preliminary hearing date has been set down for 20 November 2014,' a NSW Fair Trading spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. A spokesperson for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) told Daily Mail Australia that the estimated cost of the recall is $80 million. News Corp has also revealed that Woolworths sold up to 40 per cent of the recalled wires through their hardware chains Thrifty-Link Hardware and Home Timber and Hardware. The insulation coating on the cables was found to be of poor quality, meaning they could break prematurely and cause a fire or electrocution . The cables failed to meet electrical safety standards when the insulation coating was found to be of poor quality, meaning they could become brittle and break prematurely. 'Testing has found that the cables will degrade prematurely and if the cables are disturbed, the insulation could break and expose live conductors, resulting in possible electric shock or fires,' ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said. The ACCC warns that although there is no immediate danger, the risk is heightened if the cables are 'exposed to prolonged high temperatures'. 'Once the insulation is brittle, physical contact with the cables could dislodge the insulation and lead to electric shock or possibly fires.' About 40,000 homes and business across Australia are believed to have the cables installed . Although no reports of failure have been recorded as of yet, the ACCC warns the cables are likely to become brittle from 2016 onwards, with the installations posing a higher risk. The first cable samples from Infinity Cable Co 'were supported by accredited testing certification', according to the ACCC, however subsequent tests deemed them unsafe and led to an initial recall in October 2013 which was then reissued in 2014 with an emphasis on safety concerns. Anyone worried about their cables has been warned not to attempt to inspect or remove the cables themselves, but to contact an electrician or their builder.

"A woman was smuggled from Slovakia into Britain and sold as a sex slave as part of a ‘Dickensian’ sham marriage racket to keep immigrants in the UK, it was revealed today. The 20-year-old victim was drugged and kidnapped before being taken to England to forcibly wed a shop assistant due to be deported back to Pakistan, Preston Crown Court in Lancashire was told. She was plied with vodka and beer before the illegal ‘Nikah’ marriage ceremony at a mosque, and then repeatedly raped by her new ‘husband’ whilst being detained in a flat above his family's shop. In the shop: CCTV footage showing Azam Khan (centre right), Abdul Shinwary (bottom right), Nusrat Khan (bottom left) and the victim (centre left). Sentencing took place at Preston Crown Court today . Talks: CCTV from the shop showing Shinwary (left, in black head covering) and Khan (right, wearing headscarf) She was rescued from a house in October 2012 following a series of raids on homes in Burnley, Lancashire, and Bradford, West Yorkshire, following a tip-off she was being held against her will. Police believe several locals turned a blind eye to her ordeal, and fear she is among several women abducted from Eastern Europe then sold for £6,000 to immigrant men looking to stay in Britain. Phillip Boyd, prosecuting, told the court that the woman had no understanding of what was going on during the ceremony at the Burnley mosque because she spoke no English. He said: ‘What links all these people together is a series of events which sounds more like something from a 19th century novel by Dickens than anything happening in Europe in the 21st century. ‘The victim was handled round the continent and this country like a commodity. All the more cruel and inexcusable (as) being so unable to cope on her own, she was so ill-fitted to do anything about it.' Those involved were convicted of a series of people trafficking and sex offences. Imrich Bodor, 45, and Abdul Shinwary, 38, from Bradford, were found guilty of people trafficking for exploitation.

Azam Khan entered . into the scam after he approached a Manchester-based immigration . advisory firm, because he had run into problems with the UK Border Agency, . the court was told. During a meeting he was advised to 'marry a European girl' to secure a visa to remain in the country. Later . he was introduced to go-between Shinwary, through a cousin, who claimed . he had ‘married’ a European woman in similar circumstances. Khan was told he . would be charged £4,000 for a bride.

Kristina Makunova (centre), 37, was involved in the trafficking and got 51 weeks. Petra Dzudzova (right), also involved, will be sentenced tomorrow . The victim, who comes from a Romany gypsy community in eastern Slovakia, had been visiting a travelling fair in the town of Zempliw when she was targeted by Bodor in mid-August last year. After chatting her up, Bodor plied with alcohol laced with sleeping tablets - then after she passed out, bundled her onto a coach bound for England. The next thing she recalled was waking up in London before being taken to a house in Bradford. She begged to be taken home but she was ordered to marry a 'Mr Khan' and pressure was put on her to be intimate with him. Giving evidence on a video recording, . the victim said of Bodor: ‘I was afraid that he would beat me up. I had . seen it in his eyes. He had a very angry look. ‘I was thinking how should I get away from here, but I was afraid to leave because I did not know the way I needed to go.’ The . woman was kept at the property for two weeks where she was slapped and . kicked to the head and back. Later she was sold to Azam and forced to go . through the illegal ceremony with him which was conducted by an imam . unaware of the scam. Dingy: She was repeatedly raped by her new ‘husband’ whilst being detained in a flat above his family's shop . The woman was later held prisoner by . Azam Khan at a flat above his aunt and uncle's corner shop where he . raped her three times and assaulted her twice. She was found at the home . of Nusrat Khan during a raid in October last year. She . returned home to Slovakia in January this year with the assistance of . the Slovakian authorities and Caritas, the Slovakian catholic charity. But she was brought back to Britain by . police to give evidence against her abusers. Police retrieved a . marriage certificate from a ‘cell’ in an upstairs room where she . apparently slept. After the case, the victim said: ‘I am very happy that these bad people are going to prison. This is what I always wanted after what they did to me. Thank you to the person who rang the police. ‘I was so scared for my life. Many . times I wanted to run away from them but because of what the bad people . told me, I didn't know where to run, where to go, or who I could trust. ‘All . I wanted to do was go home to my family in Slovakia. If the police . hadn't come to get me, I don't think I would be here today. Investigation: The shop in Burnley, Lancashire. Police believe several locals turned a blind eye to her ordeal . ‘Thank . you to the police and all the other good people who looked after me and . got me back to my family. Thank you for believing me.’ Judge . Jonathan Gibson said: ‘Over the past two months or so and during the . course of this trial the jury and I have heard through the evidence and . have observed at close quarters the sordid world of people trafficking . and in particular have observed the trauma, pain and distress suffered . by the victim. ‘At the time . of the events she was 20 and from a rural part of Slovakia. She was . plainly vulnerable to manipulation by those of greater intellect, . sophistication and power. She suffered a dreadful ordeal being kidnapped in Slovakia by two men. They were known to Bodor and were part of a gang. ‘She . was kept against her will suffering a mixture of deception to come to . the UK, initially believing she was coming to the Czech Republic to find . work. ‘She was kept in various houses in this country and was sold twice as a prospective bride for Pakistani men. ‘She . was effectively forced to go through a sham marriage and she was . repeatedly raped.

However, others within the community at Bradford and Burnley have turned a blind eye. ‘Throughout her ordeal all she wanted to do was go home.

"Spy sources in Moscow today made the astonishing claim that a US undercover operation may have sabotaged a new Russian Superjet plane that crashed in Indonesia two weeks ago. The aircraft was on a demonstration flight aimed at securing lucrative orders when it slammed into a mountain killing all 45 passengers and crew. 'We are investigating the theory that it was industrial sabotage,' a GRU military intelligence source said. Crash site: Wreckage of the Russian Sukhoi Superjet 100 aircraft shown strewn across Mount Salak, West Java province . Disaster: The logo of Sukhoi Co. is clearly visible (bottom, centre) among the wreckage of the Superjet . The extraordinary Cold War-style claim echoes high-level allegations in Moscow that the US used powerful lasers to zap a Russian Mars probe seven months ago. Other satellite launches - there have been half a dozen failures in the last 18 months - might be the work of US sabotage, raising the spectre of a sustained campaign against its technology by American secret services, it has been argued. A headline to a story in Russia's biggest newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda today read: 'Are the Americans implicated in the Superjet crash?' 'We know that they have special technology - that we also have - to jam signals from the ground or cause parameter readings to malfunction,' said the unnamed intelligence official, highlighting a US military presence at Jakarta Airport from where the plane took off on May 9. The Sukhoi Superjet 100 is the first entirely new passenger plane unveiled by Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Mystery: The jet, pictured here in Jakarta, went missing while on a demonstration flight . Sabotage claim: Sukhoi's chief civil test pilot Alexander Yablontsev (pictured) flew the Superjet that mysteriously crashed . It is designed to grab market share from Western manufacturers. Russian officials insist investigators have established 'that there were no technical problems until the crash'. After the Mars probe failed, Russians space chief Vladimir Popovkin warned: 'We don't want to accuse anybody, but there are very powerful devices that can influence spacecraft now. 'The possibility they were used cannot be ruled out.' He stressed: 'The frequent failure of our space launches, which occur at a time when they are flying over the part of Earth not visible from Russia, where we do not see the spacecraft and do not receive telemetric information, are not clear to us.' A senior navy commander also blamed the US Navy for the August 2000 Kursk nuclear submarine sinking that killed 118 seamen, since several US ships were in the vicinity of the Barents Sea exercises.

"The new waxwork figure of Jane Austen, which has gone on display at the Jane Austen Centre in Bath . Her face may not be as familiar as her books, but that could soon change. This waxwork shows what Jane Austen may have looked like –according to a former FBI forensic artist who helped make it. The Pride and Prejudice author never sat for an official portrait – she was sketched only once, by her sister Cassandra in 1810 – so the Jane Austen Centre in Bath, asked painter and researcher Melissa Dring to create the first realistic likeness. She spent 18 months trawling diaries, letters and other documents for information, before royal sculptor Mark Richards used her findings to build the 5ft 6in waxwork. Miss Dring, who trained in composite art with the FBI, used diaries, letters and written accounts for any snippet of information about her physical appearance. Royal sculptor Mark Richards then brought her research to life and created the 5ft 6ins waxwork which was unveiled yesterday. Miss Dring said: ‘In the drawing Cassandra made, it really doesn't reflect the fun, witty, amusing person that all written accounts of her seem to portray - this really lovely girl. ‘From all the accounts I looked through, I tried to reflect someone who would sit there plotting her next book.’ She added: ‘It was so interesting to find out whatever I could from reading different bits and whatever I could about her.’ Austen lived between 1775 and 1817, moving to Bath in 1800 and on to Chawton in 1809 before her death. Painter and researcher Melissa Dring created the first realistic likeness, left, as Austen never sat for an official picture. The portrait, right, was based on a sketch by the author's sister Cassandra . The artist said that Austen's family all seemed to share the same long nose, brown eyes and curly brown hair . The only authenticated sketch of her was produced in 1810 by her sister Cassandra, drawn in pencil and watercolours and depicting her sitting in a chair. Since then portraits have been produced but these are only interpretations of Cassandra's original image - including the images of Austen on the £10 note. Miss Dring, who trained as a portrait painter at the Royal Academy of Arts and has worked as Police Forensic artist with the FBI in America, also took into account family traits. ‘She came from a large Austen family and they all seemed to share the long nose, the bright sparkly brown eyes and curly brown hair,’ she said. ‘And these characteristics come through the generations.’","Waxwork shows what Pride and Prejudice author may have looked like .

"Pope Francis praised exorcists for 'helping those who suffer because of the work of the devil' Pope Francis has given a special blessing to a convention of exorcists, praising them for 'helping those who suffer because of the work of the devil'. The International Association of Exorcists brought some 300 members to Rome to discuss the impact of the occult and Satanism, which many of them fear is on the increase. The Pope, who often speaks about the fight against Satan in his sermons, said by treating people who are possessed, exorcists demonstrate that 'the Church welcomes those suffering from the Devil's works'. Speaking to Vatican Radio, Dr Valter Cascioli, a psychiatrist and spokesman for the International Association of Exorcists, warned of 'an extraordinary increase in demonic activity'. He said that  this makes it even more worrying that 'the number of people who are turning to these practices, which are damaging psychologically, spiritually and morally, is constantly growing'. The Association, which brings together Catholic priests and psychiatrists, was founded in 1990  and given formal recognition by the Vatican in June. Dr Cascioli said that too many people today undervalue the temptation to engage in 'ordinary demonic activity', which leaves them unprepared to fight off greater attacks by the devil. In societies marked by 'rushing, superficiality, exaggerated individualism and secularization,' he added, 'the battle against evil and the devil increasingly is becoming an emergency'. At the convention, Father Aldo Buonaiuto blamed the phenomenon of Halloween for a spike in demonic possessions in October. The organisation's emergency number receives hundreds of calls over this period, around 40 a day, especially from parents who fear that their child has been initiated into the occult, he said. He added: 'Many say Halloween is a simple carnival, but in fact there is nothing innocent or fun about it - it is the antechamber to something much more dangerous. 'There are always more evil rituals, animal sacrifices, desecrations of cemeteries and thefts of sacred bones at the time of the 31 October. Exorcism saw a revival of interest following the 1973 film The Exorcist and other popular references . Participating in Halloween is 'like an initiation into the occult', he said. 'For the sects it is the best time of year to recruit new members. From here the door to the devil can be opened. For this reason its necessary for us to speak out and not play down the danger.' To replace the 'dangerous' festival the Catholic Church in Italy have now launched the initiative 'Holyween', he said. 'While most people are seeped in zombies and horror we put on our door or windows a light or an image evocative of the saints. 'And then there will be masses, prayer vigils and worship to celebrate the saints and victory of good over evil.' The Pope was speaking at a convention of 300 priests and psychiatrists who were in Rome to discuss the impact of the occult and Satanism, which many of them fear is on the increase . At the conference, Pope Francis warned the exorcists that they must treat those possessed with 'kindness'. He wrote in a message: 'Those who perform this particular ministry, in conjunction with the bishops' must work 'with love and kindness from the church towards those who suffer because of the evil one.' Last year, Pope Francis appeared to cast out a demon from a wheelchair-bound man who said he was possessed by the devil. The Vatican insisted the pope 'didn't intend to perform any exorcism,' and it released a statement that said 'he simply intended to pray for someone who was suffering who was presented to him'. The man later said that Francis had failed to banish the demons from his body. However, after Francis placed his hands on him, he was able to walk again, he claimed. Last year, Pope Francis appeared to cast out a demon from a wheelchair-bound man who said he was possessed by the devil. The Vatican insisted the pope 'didn't intend to perform any exorcism' The exorcists' association was introduced in Italy by veteran exorcist Father Gabriele Amorth, to share experience as increased interest in occult practices has boosted demand for exorcisms. Fatherr Francesco Bamonte, an exorcist from the Diocese of Rome told official Vatican newspaper L’Osservatore Romano that the Holy See’s approval of the group 'is cause for joy... for the church as a whole.'

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott has copped a ribbing from Today Show presenter Karl Stefanovic after he looked a little a dusty the morning after his important night with Japanese PM Shinzo Abe.The Channel Nine breakfast show host observed that Mr Abbott might have had a few too many Sakes with Mr Abe after signing agreements to boost trade and defence ties between Australia and Japan. Mr Abbott celebrated the deal with his 'good friend' Mr Abe at a formal dinner at Parliament House in Canberra on Tuesday night and appeared on the Today Show in a live link from Canberra at 7.16am on Wednesday. 'You look a little bit worse for wear if you don't mind me saying so PM. You didn't get on the Sakes with the Japanese PM ?,' Stefanovic asked. Scroll down for video . Dusty? Prime Minister Tony Abbott was grilled about his appearance on the Today Show by Karl Stefanovic on Wednesday morning after the PM's big night with the Japanese PM . Mr Abbott laughed and admitted he had indeed had a very lively night. 'Look the truth is it was a very convivial dinner last night, very convivial. I accept that,' he confessed. Pushed on just how many alcoholic drinks he'd had, the PM wouldn't say. Instead, he explained: 'It was also as you'd expect, a very responsible dinner too.' Earlier on Tuesday Mr Abbott tweeted: 'Great to welcome my good friend @AbeShinzo - Aust & Japan have forged a firm friendship & a practical partnership.' During the dinner the PM said Japanese firms invest in Australia because of a decades-long relationship built on trust. Boozing: Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe and Prime Minister of Australia Tony Abbott were pictured making a toast during an official dinner at Parliament House in Canberra on Tuesday . 'I shouldn't drink too much wine': Mr Abe complimented the Australian wine at the dinner held in his honour . Cheers: The signing of the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement comes close to the anniversary of Australia's 1957 commerce agreement with Japan . 'Based on investment figures, after the US and UK, no one trusts Australia more than Japan,' Mr Abbott explained. 'And that trust is amply reciprocated.' The signing of the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement comes close to the anniversary of Australia's 1957 commerce agreement with Japan. The pact was the springboard for the strong trade ties that now exist, and without it, Australia would not have the strong iron ore and gas industries it currently boasts, Mr Abbott said. 'It was a very responsible dinner': Tony Abbott and Mr Abe signed agreements to boost trade and defence ties between Australia and Japan . Worried: Stefanovic appeared concerned Abbott's possible hangover on Wednesday morning . Mr Abe continued the charm offensive after a much-lauded speech to parliament earlier in the day, complimenting the Australian wine at the dinner held in his honour. 'I told myself I shouldn't drink too much wine. But I couldn't beat out with the greatest wine from Australia,' he told the gathering, adding the trade pact would now allow his country access to cheaper Australian wine and beef. Mr Abe also touched on political issues, arguing the two countries should work together towards regional peace efforts. $3000 off a new Toyota: Car buyers are the big winners in Australia's free trade deal with Japan .

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten praised Japan's post-World War II recovery to become an economic powerhouse. Australia had much to learn from Japan's experience going from an industrial to a more developed economy, he said. Mr Abbott will accompany Mr Abe on a tour of the Pilbara region on Wednesday, with a visit to mining giant Rio Tinto's West Angelas mine. Mr Abe and wife Akie arrived in Canberra on Monday night for the first bilateral visit by a Japanese leader in 12 years. The main benefit for Australian consumers of the new economic partnership agreement will be the reduced cost of Japanese cars, international trade expert Alan Oxley told MailOnline. 'The government has indicated there's a tariff of 5 to 8 per cent that will come off automobiles,' Mr Oxley, principal of ITS Global, said. Australian Automobile Association chief Andrew McKellar said Japan was the largest source of imported vehicles in Australia and made up about 30 per cent of the market. 'We would estimate [the trade deal] would reduce the amount of tax payable on a new car by about $1000 to $2000,' Mr McKellar added. 'For a larger vehicle like a [Toyota] Land Cruiser the saving is probably closer to $3000.' Toyota is the top selling Japanese brand in Australia but Mazda, Nissan, Honda and Subaru also have significant sales in Australia, he said. Mr Oxley said Japanese electronics and whitegoods are also set to become cheaper, but the tariffs on these goods are much lower than the tariff on cars so the difference will not be as substantial.","Australian Prime Minister dined with the Japanese Prime Minster on Tuesday night .

"If you want to ensure you dream of something really delicious while you sleep, head to Japan and pick yourself one of the new range of 'bread beds' taking the country by storm. The latest offering from the nation with the predilection for wacky home furnishings is a quirky collection of bedding inspired by baked goods. So you can lay your weary head on a square toast pillow, tuck yourself into a croissant sleeping bag,  snuggle up inside a doughnut and even wrap yourself in an omelette. Sleeping bags shaped as croissants and slice-shaped bread cushions feature in the bread bed range . The good-enough-to-eat range of soft furnishings is being sold by Felissimo, and each piece is priced at ¥16,800 (£110). Brian Ashcraft of Kotaku translated some of the names of the items in the range from Japanese to English. The sleeping bag that looks like a creme horn or croissant roughly means 'flop down in a chocolate nap'. The original Japanese name merges the words Korone (コロネ), this dessert's name in Japanese, . and the word Gorone (ごろ寝), which means 'napping', reported Kotaku. This sleeping bag that looks like a creme horn or croissant roughly means 'flop down in a chocolate nap' The soft croissant sleeping bag rolls out flat - and inside it's all 'chocolatey' The toast set's name is translated to 'thick slices of Japanese cushion bread'.

A thick, round, 'glazed' sleeping bag is sliced in the middle to resemble a doughnut, and allows the owner to tuck in as its 'cream'. The name is, roughly, 'cream pocket bread'. A circular beige sleeping bag which comes with a green blanket is dubbed the 'goodnight dessert omelette'. It rolls around you and fastens, or rolls out flat and circular. The blanket resembles the 'green tea cream' accompaniment. Twitter user @chiemitter uploaded a . photo of the cushions last Sunday. The tweet has since been retweeted . more than 10,000 times.

"Eating raw fish is a foodie trend that has been exported from the East and adopted across much of the world with open arms. But eating live octopus might be taking things a little too far. Not for these brave visitors to a food festival in Seoul, South Korea, however. Sticky businesses: A South Korean couple show how it's done as they eat a live octopus during a festival to promote a local food in Seoul, South Korea . Making most people squirm at the thought, these willing participants pulled wriggling octopus out from a bucket and then tried to force the sticky creatures into their mouths. Tentacles sucking onto fingers, lips and cheeks, it proved to be quite tricky to get any of the eight legs into their mouths. But eventually, hungry - we assume starved - visitors to this local food festival started taking chunks out of the poor creatures' many legs. Chewing the sticky writhing limbs, they proved it was possible to eat octopus if there was ever the need. Hungry? Any hint of hunger may turn to nausea at the thought of satisfying a grumbling stomach with this sticky squirming meal . Get in there: Trying to get the wriggling octopus into the mouth in the first place often proved to be difficult, but some clearly found it easier than others... Whether or not this fad will catch on, remains to be seen. It certainly wouldn't make a great first date dinner. But in Seoul, people seemed happy to give it a go. The country's Donghae city holds a Squid Festival, every September, attracting up to 70,000 visitors. People can catch them with their bare hands, and take part in a ceremony that celebrates the local food staple. Suckers: The octopus put up a good fight sucking onto anything, everything, and each other . Legless: But the hungry visitors proved too great a match for the octopus; this poor one looked like it had already lost some of it's legs  before this man chomped on one of the few remaining . Competitions include a 'squid treatment contest', and a 'raw slicing contest'. The festival also coincided with South Korea's Supreme Court ruling today that a man be acquitted for the murder of his girlfriend, after he argued that she choked on live octopus. The court upheld the acquittal of the 32-year-old man who had been sentenced to life imprisonment. The long-running case, fuelled by accusations of police incompetence, had received enormous media and public attention in South Korea. Live octopus await their fate in a tank at the food festival . 'Indirect, circumstantial evidence is insufficient to support the charge that the accused killed the woman by suffocating her,' the court said in a statement, upholding an April ruling by an appeals court. The man, identified only as Kim, checked into a motel in Incheon City near Seoul with his girlfriend in April 2010 after buying two live octopuses from a local restaurant, the court heard.","Visitors to food festival in Seoul, South Korea show how to eat live octopus .

"David Cameron has warned that Europe must get tougher with Vladimir Putin – or risk repeating the mistakes it made with Hitler. He compared the response to Russian aggression with the disastrous appeasement of the Nazi dictator at the Munich conference in 1938. Demanding a firmer line against Moscow’s stance in Ukraine, the Prime Minister voiced fears that Russia intends to conquer the rest of the country. David Cameron has warned that Europe must get tougher with Vladimir Putin or risk repeating the mistakes it made with Hitler . Mr Cameron made the private remarks to other EU leaders at a summit in Brussels on Saturday, according to Italian newspaper La Repubblica. He was quoted as saying: ‘We run the  risk of repeating the mistakes made in Munich in 1938. We cannot know what will happen next. This time we cannot meet Putin’s demands. ‘He has already taken Crimea and we cannot allow him to take the whole  country.’ His reported comments come after Mr Putin threatened he could ‘take Kiev in a fortnight’ during a phone  call with EU Commission president Manuel Barroso. Demanding a firmer line against Moscow's stance in Ukraine, the Prime Minister voiced fears that Russia intends to conquer the rest of the country . German Chancellor Angela Merkel reportedly told the Brussels summit that the Russian leader was ‘moving towards military escalation’ and there are ‘no limits to the unpredictability of Putin’. Mr Cameron has denounced the presence of up to 15,000 Russian troops on Ukrainian soil as ‘unjustified and unacceptable’. On Monday he told MPs that Moscow, which has already seized Crimea, was  trying to force its neighbour to ‘abandon  its democratic choices at the barrel of  a gun’. He will chair a Nato conference  in Wales later this week in which a new  force of 10,000 troops are expected to  be announced. Last night it was reported that Britain is to order 600 Army infantry vehicles as  part of its commitment to raise defence spending. Defence minister Julian Brazier said a  platoon may also be sent in a fortnight to join Rapid Trident, the joint US–Ukraine exercise. In a speech today, Defence  Secretary Michael Fallon will warn that Nato’s ‘credibility’ depends on European leaders boosting military spending. Only four members of the alliance – the US, UK, Estonia and Greece – meet a pledge to spend at least 2 per cent of their GDP on defence. Mr Fallon will tell the Royal United Services Institute think-tank: ‘Nato was formed on the basis that Europe would pay her way. Like any insurance policy, defence only pays out when you pay in. ‘US taxpayers won’t go on picking up the cheque if we choose to prioritise social  welfare spending when the threats are on our doorstep.’ Russia has boosted defence spending by 50 per cent and has pledged to spend another £420billion over the next six years.   The Munich summit is now seen as the high point of the British and French appeasement of Adolf Hitler. Afterwards, prime minister Neville  Chamberlain declared he had agreed ‘peace for our time’. However, appeasement allowed Germany to annexe parts of Czechoslovakia and is seen as encouraging further Nazi aggression and the outbreak of the Second World War.","Compared the response to Russian .

"A new witness to the shooting of Michael Brown has come forward saying the unarmed black teenager had his hands up and was running away from Officer Darren Wilson as he was gunned down in Missouri. The man, who asked to not be identified, is a construction worker who witnessed the Aug. 9 shooting near an apartment complex in Ferguson. He spoke to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch anonymously — and his account is the first time someone who neither knew Brown nor had ties to Ferguson corroborates accounts that the teenager had his hands up. In the interview, the witness said Brown, 18, moved toward Officer Wilson in his final moments but it was unclear if Brown was moving in a 'stumble to . the ground' or 'OK, I'm going to get you, you're already shooting me.' 'I don't know if he was going after him or if he was falling down to die,' the man told the Post-Dispatch. 'It wasn't a bull rush.' Scroll down for video . Michael Brown (left) was shot dead by police officer Darren Wilson (right) in a confrontation on Aug. 9 . Hands up: The new witness' account corroborates the story told by Dorian Johnson (pictured), who was with Brown the day of the shooting and said the teenager had his hands up when he was gunned down . The body of Michael Brown lies on the ground in the aftermath of his shooting death . Supporters of the police officer have said Brown charged at Wilson, prompting the officer to shoot him. The construction worker, who's already shared his story with the FBI, said he was about 50 feet from where the shooting happened. The man said he'd seen Brown walking down the street less than an hour before the incident. The teenager struck up a random conversation with the witness' co-worker, who did not speak to the newspaper but shared his story with the FBI. It was about a half hour later that the witness heard a gunshot — and turned to see Brown running away from Wilson's squad car. The officer was 10 to 15 feet behind and chased Brown down the street, the man said. About 90 feet away from the car, Wilson fired another shot while Brown had his back to him, the witness told the Post-Dispatch. Brown stumbled, apparently wounded. Brown's death sparked a national debate about police militarization after the police response to the protests over the teenager's death. Here, a SWAT team approaches a protester in Ferguson . The heavily-militarized Ferguson and St. Louis County police response to protests in the streets shocked the nation and served to further inflame racial tensions . Attorney General Eric Holder has launched a wide-ranging civil rights investigation into police practices in the St. Louis area . He turned around with his hands up, repeating 'OK' over and over. Wilson was about 10 feet from Brown when the teenager began to move. 'He's kind of walking back toward the cop,' the witness told the Post-Dispatch, noting Brown still had his hands up. The cop began to move away from the teenager and opened fire. Brown's hands began to go down after the third shot. Wilson continued to fire as he backed away. The new witness' account is similar to that of Dorian Johnson, who was with Brown minutes before the shooting. Shortly after, Johnson told local TV stations that Brown had been surrendering when Wilson opened fire without cause or warning, sparking angry protests over the teenager's death. Several other witnesses — Tiffany Mitchell, Piaget Crenshaw and James McKnight — have also said they saw Brown's hands up. None of them described Brown rushing toward the officer. New images of Wilson surfaced this week. He is pictured here with an unidentified woman . New pictures that surfaced this week show Wilson and ex-wife Ashley Nicole at their wedding in Old Monroe, Missouri, in October 2011.

"As Wayne Rooney prepares to pull on an England shirt for the 100th time, Sportsmail writers provide their memories of the striker from his time representing the Three Lions... JEFF POWELL . The first day of March, 2006, was unusually wintry, even for Liverpool. England were playing Uruguay in a friendly at Anfield. There was a dusting of snow during the match, followed by a heavy fall as it ended in a 2-1 victory for England. The snow was several inches deep as I trudged through the Shankly Gates, head down against the storm. Suddenly, splat. A snowball hit me in the chest. I looked up to see young Wayne Rooney, laughing. Then he said: 'Hello, Mr Powell. Come on. Help me deal with these lads.' He was engaged in a snowball fight. A friendly one, even though this was Anfield, the kids were Liverpool fans and he was a former Everton player who had become a superstar with Manchester United. Wayne Rooney pictured during the line up ahead of England's game against Uruguay in 2006 at Anfield . England won 2-1 and Rooney had a laugh with fans and Sportsmail's Jeff Powell afterwards in Liverpool . I joined in, shoulder to shoulder with Wayne, until both of us and the group of boys were smothered in snow. There was more laughter as the lads shouted their thanks and scurried off through the dim yellow light cast by the old lamp posts. As I picked up my briefcase, Rooney asked: ‘Where you heading?’ ‘Driving back to London.’ ‘Where you parked?’ ‘Up there in a side street.’ ‘I’ll walk with you. Can’t be too safe this time of night.’ And so he did, as we chuckled about the snowballs. It hadn’t been his best of nights in an England shirt. He had been substituted in the 64th minute, before Peter Crouch and Joe Cole scored the goals which won the game. Still he took time out to delight that group of fans and josh with me. Still he was one of the lads. Still is at heart. As he says, if he hadn’t made it as a footballer he would be out there with them on cold nights. Behind the goal rather than shooting into it. Those who would knock England’s best player might think on that as he collects his 100th cap at Wembley this Saturday. Raise a glass, even. Cheers Wayne. Thanks for the memory. Rooney tries to tackle Mario Regueiro at Anfield as England went on to beat Uruguay 2-1 in Merseyside . ROB DRAPER . It is sad I’ve never felt more excited about Rooney than watching him on his first competitive start for England against Turkey at the Stadium of Light in 2003. He was mesmerising. The World Cup semi-finalists couldn’t get near him. And he was 17. You left feeling as though the last piece of the jigsaw had been completed in the puzzle of the golden generation. Rooney pictured during the 2003 match at the Stadium of Light between England and Turkey . MATT BARLOW . Opportunities to understand Rooney have been rare, and interviews brief, usually lit up by a flash of meaning in his blue-eyed stare rather than his words. After a brilliant qualifying campaign for the World Cup in 2010 he went to South Africa with Fabio Capello comparing him to Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo and yet his public communications of note amounted to an abusive rant at a TV camera after the bore draw with Algeria. He has begun to reveal a little more since he became captain, but the fondest memories have been his flashes of brilliance on the pitch, in particular the goal against Poland last year. He was wearing a protective headguard after clashing with Phil Jones in training — it had come off and he headed the ball in anyway. Rooney, pictured wearing his headguard for England, during a game he scored against Poland in 2013 . MATT LAWTON . On the pitch? At Euro 2004, he was dazzling. Off it?

Coleen has proved one of the better WAGs after helping those in the gym in Baden-Baden in 2006 . CHARLES SALE . The build-up to the 2006 World Cup was dominated by a stand-off between Rooney and England following a metatarsal injury.

"The names of 648 co-workers who died in the 9/11 terror attacks were arranged on their Ground Zero memorial according to who knew whom best, it was revealed yesterday. For the last 12 years, passers by may have assumed that the names on the Cantor Fitzgerald section of the bronze panels that wrap halfway around the north pool of the 9/11 Memorial were sorted randomly, rather than by age or initial. But it has now been revealed that they were in fact arranged based on 'meaningful adjecencies', allowing the names of best friends and co-working relatives to sit side by side. ‘They weren’t people who just worked . together and went home. They made up the fabric of their lives,’ Danielle Gardner - whose brother Douglas did not survive the attacks - . told the New York Post. Such a tragedy: Cantor Fitzgerald head Howard Lutnick walks among the names of those lost from his firm on Sept 11, 2001 . Investment . bank Cantor Fitzgerald lost almost three quarters of its workforce when . American Airlines Flight 11 slammed into the north tower a few stories . below is offices on floors 101 and 105. More . than any . other financial firm, the bank was seen as a family-run operation that . fostered close friendships and saw brothers, aunts, uncles and even . parents working shoulder to shoulder. The change was made after a campaign by survivors and relatives that fought for 'meaningful adjacencies’ rather than those organised according to age or initial. Each . name was inputted into a specifically-designed computer programme that . grouped colleagues together according to who knew who best. Co-workers, close relatives, best friends and even a beloved baby sitter are clustered on the memorial, according to the New York Post. Ms Gardner has also completed ‘Out of the Clear Blue Sky,’ a documentary about the unprecedented losses suffered by the company. Douglas Gardner: Mr Gardner was a former Cantor Fitzgerald employee attending a meeting at Windows on the World, a restaurant on the North Tower's top floor . Mr Gardner, 39, worked on the firm for several years with childhood friend Douglas Gurian. An executive director by the time he left, Mr Gardner and Mr Gurian, 38, had known each other since before the first grade. They spent summers together on Fire Island, married about the same time - Mr Gurian proposed at Mr Gardner's summer home - and even had children at about the same time, said the Post. Tragically, Mr Gardner was attending a meeting at Windows on the World, a restaurant on the top floor of the North Tower, when the building was struck. He and Gurian, a broker, did not make it out alive. Their names are close, with only trader Calvin Gooding between them, according to the Post. Mr Gooding, 38, met Mr Gardner in college. The night before all three men met their tragic fate, Danielle Gardner called Mr Gooding to ask if he would sing and speak at her brother's 40th birthday party, set to happen Oct 5, 2001, she told the Post. 'I’ll definitely want to perform and give a speech,' she told the Post. Stephen Colaio is on the lThe Colaio brothers: Stephen Colaio (left) and Mark Colaio (right) were two of the thousands who died on 9/11eft and Mark Colaio is on the right  the Plaza, NY. Mark Colaio, 34, and a senior managing director, talked bond broker brother Stephen, 32, into joining the tightly-knit firm. The elder brother often had a gorup of 25 employees over for parties at his Manhattan apartment and out to his Montauk beach house, his sister Jean told the Post. 'They spent a lot of time outside work and shared a lot of special times,' said Jean Colaio, adding that 'they really looked out for each other — while working, as friends, and, I’m sure, on that day.' Joining the Colaio brothers nearby is Thomas Pedicini, 30. As Mark Colaio's brother-in-law, he was recruited into the firm's equity department, the Post noted. Best friends: Left to right - Elizabeth Jordan, Stephen Hoffman, Robert Jordan, Lois Schiavetta . Stephen Hoffman, 36, and Robert Jordan, 34, went to college together and ended up at the firm as bond traders, Mr Hoffman's brother Greg told the Post. They surfed and played golf together - they both even married school teachers, Greg Hoffman noted. With so much in common, the two families were very close, even joining Hoffman's family for trips to the Jersey Shore. 'That’s the way those guys lived,' Greg Hoffman told the Post, adding that 'in the end, that’s the way they died, together.' They even hired their babysitter: Amy O'Doherty was brought into the Cantor Fitzgerald fold as an intern after babysitting for Daniel Shea and Joseph Shea (far right), she soon earned a full time role at the firm . Daniel Shea, 37, and brother Joseph Shea, 47, were both managing directors by the time they found themselves with a familiar intern - former babysitter Amy Doherty. Having known her since she was 13, it was only natural to offer her a tryout after watching how easily she multi-tasked juggling the kids and all their various activities. 'She handled it so effortlessly, and the kids were crazy about her,' Nancy Shea, Joseph’s widow, told the Post. 'She was indispensable to our family.' Hired shortly after graduation in 2000, Ms O'Doherty was with the firm just over a year when the terror attacks occurred, Ms Shea noted. The Lang Family: Rosanne Lang, 50, was an equities trader at Cantor, nephew Brendan was a project manager with another firm in the South Tower, when the planes hit he called his parents to say he was going to find her - neither survived . Rosanne Lang, 50, and an equities trader with the firm, was searched for by nephew Brendan Lang, 30, after the first plane hit, according to a relative who spoke to the Post. Brendan called his parents telling them he was going to find his aunt, he had a plan he said. Mr Lang was a project manager working in the South Tower - across from his aunt's North Tower office. Neither made it out alive, but Cantor placed their names next to each other despite Brendan Lang having never worked for the firm. 'Scoop' Esposito: Bill 'Scoop' Esposito survived the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993, but died on 9/11 . Bill 'Scoop' Esposito, 52, and a partner at the firm, had survived the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993. He and bond broker Peter Milano, 43, led a pregnant women to safety during that attack, a relative told the Post. It took them more than two hours to make it to the ground floor via the stairwell, but they did it, and Mr Esposito once again came to the rescue. 'When they got to the bottom floor, glass was falling. He pushed Peter out of the way and saved his life,' Mr Esposito's daughter Susan told the Post. Mr Esposito also bought senior vice president Thomas Strada's wife a baby gift the day before the attacks, she had given birth only days earlier, she noted.

"Slated to die: Scott Panetti, who gunned down his wife's parents as she and their child watched in 1992, will be executed by lethal injection December 3 despite years of claims he's mentally unfit . A Texas death row convict who wore a cowboy outfit as he represented himself at his 1995 trial, where he tried to subpoena Jesus and JFK, has been given a date to die. Scott Panetti, who gunned down his wife's parents as she and their child watched in 1992, will be executed by lethal injection December 3. The 56-year-old's case has appeared before the U.S. Supreme Court at least three times over the years as his supporters maneuvered to prove he's mentally unfit to be put to death. The most recent was early this month when the justices refused to review his latest appeal. State attorneys have argued he exaggerates some of his symptoms to avoid execution. Panetti was convicted of fatally shooting his in-laws, Joe and Amanda Alvarado, at their Fredericksburg home. His wife was living with her parents and a week earlier had obtained a court order to keep Panetti away. His wife and 3-year-old daughter, were sprayed with blood when Panetti shot his in-laws. They were held hostage until he surrendered after a lengthy standoff with police. He blamed it all on 'Sarge,' one of his multiple personalities. His trial judge assigned Panetti a standby attorney after he chose to be his own lawyer at his 1995 trial, where he wore a purple cowboy outfit, flipped a coin to select a juror and wanted to subpoena Jesus Christ and John F. Kennedy as witnesses. He insisted only an insane person could prove insanity. 'Scott Panetti is not competent for execution and therefore his execution would serve no retributive purpose,' his appeals attorney, Greg Wiercioch, said Thursday. 'It is unfortunate that an execution date has been set. Delusional? Attorneys contend Panetti is so delusional that he can't understand why he was convicted and condemned. Here, he's pictured with his mother and father . Always has a bible: Panetti already had a history of mental problems before the shooting, recording 14 hospital stays over 11 years. He's seen here with his brother . 'He has a fixed delusion that Satan, working through the state of Texas, is seeking to execute him for preaching the Gospel. His execution would be a miserable spectacle.' A day before he was to die in 2007, the Supreme Court stopped Panetti's scheduled execution for further review by lower courts. I just wanted to see my wife,' Panetti, in a taped statement played at his capital murder trial, explained why he went to the home armed with a rifle, a sawed-off shotgun and three knives and dressed in camouflage clothing. 'I put on my combat stuff so if I was cornered, I wanted to have my equipment. It was like I wasn't even in control, like someone else was pushing me.' His wife and 3-year-old daughter, sprayed with blood when Panetti shot his in-laws, were held hostage until he surrendered after a lengthy standoff with police. He blamed it all on 'Sarge,' one of his multiple personalities. Previous stay: Now aged 56, a day before he was to die in 2007, the Supreme Court stopped Panetti's scheduled execution for further review by lower courts . Horrific crime: Panetti, at right on a horse with his wife and child, murdered his in-laws as his wife and daughter were splattered with their blood in 1992 . During jury selection at his trial, he flipped a coin to decide whether a juror should be put on his panel, fired his lawyers and insisted on defending himself. He submitted an initial witness list that sought 200 subpoenas, including Jesus Christ and John F. Kennedy. He showed up for court dressed in cowboy clothing that mimicked Western B-movie star Tom Mix, complete with a big cowboy hat dangling on a string across his back. He took the stand in the identity of 'Sarge,' speaking in staccato non-sentences: 'Boom, boom, blood, blood.' Jurors rejected his defense of not guilty by reason of insanity, convicted him and sentenced him to death. Panetti had moved to Texas with his parents in the 1970s. He worked as a ranchhand — his occupation on prison documents is listed as blacksmith — and already had a history of mental problems before the shooting, recording 14 hospital stays over 11 years. He told lawyers his scheduled punishment was part of a satanic conspiracy to prevent him from preaching the gospel. At a federal evidentiary hearing, defense medical experts said while he understood he was to be executed, he did not connect the murders as the reason for the punishment. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals refused to stop the execution, but the Supreme Court subsequently agreed to consider his case. Panetti had moved to Texas with his parents in the 1970s.

"With or without Diego Costa, one question is being asked ahead of the weekend’s standout clash: can Manchester United’s defence handle Chelsea’s attack? The theory is United’s inexperienced rearguard will find it difficult to shackle the league leaders’ vibrant forwards. No Costa for Chelsea? No problem. Not when Jose Mourinho can unleash, among others, Eden Hazard, Oscar, Willian and Cesc Fabregas. Yet here’s another way of looking at things: do United’s forwards have enough to menace Chelsea’s back four? The manner in which Louis van Gaal’s team have defended so far may be a cause for concern but is what is happening at the other end of the pitch a potentially bigger worry? Man United's Robin van Persie trains during Friday's session alongside Wayne Rooney and Radamel Falcao . Chelsea's Diego Costa celebrates scoring their second goal against Arsenal at Stamford Bridge on October 4 . Tackling the title favourites is Van Gaal’s biggest test since he became manager and all over the pitch there will be key battles, not least whether his attackers can come up with the wit and skill to outfox John Terry and Gary Cahill, the best central defensive pairing in the Premier League. If you were naming a dream team, many of you — for good reason — would have your three forwards as Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao. They have been magnificent players, their quality undisputed around the world. Those three should guarantee bundles of goals. But here’s the thing. Van Persie recently turned 31, Rooney was 29 on Friday — the same age Falcao will be when he celebrates his next birthday. The concern for clubs when strikers get into that age range is whether they will maintain their standards and consistency, never mind get better. Improvement is not something Van Gaal has to worry about with his defence. Luke Shaw is 19, Phil Jones only 22; Marcos Rojo is a 24-year-old who has played in a World Cup final, while Tyler Blackett is 20. United may need another centre back but that quartet’s best years are ahead of them. Can you say the same about the strikers? Let’s start with Van Persie, the man whose goals were the catalyst for United’s last title in 2013. When I have watched him over the last 12-18 months, he has looked a different player to the one who spearheaded Sir Alex Ferguson’s attack when he arrived from Arsenal. If you were going to back a coach to get Van Persie thriving, you would pick Van Gaal, his compatriot, but he has looked off the pace. You could argue he is feeling the effects of the World Cup but even in Brazil he didn’t look right. Is he just out of form or has he reached that stage when the dip starts? Last season he had to contend with the old criticisms that he was injury-prone and we didn’t see evidence of the great partnership with Rooney that we all expected. An interesting statistic is the fact they have only created a total of eight goals for each other since they became a pair in 2012. Don’t get me wrong, he has been a brilliant striker. But now he is 31, you have to wonder whether we have seen his best. That is a question I also asked about Rooney earlier in the season. In terms of the number of games he has played in his career, he is the equivalent of a 32-year-old. As for Falcao, the issue with him is intriguing. He was the best out-and-out striker in the world not so long ago and we have seen flashes of quality since he arrived at Old Trafford, but he is coming to the most demanding league in the world on the back of a cruciate- ligament injury. That doesn’t necessarily mean there is a problem. Ruud van Nistelrooy arrived in Manchester on the back of a similar injury and became one of the best strikers the Premier League has seen. He had time on his side to recover, though, as he was 23 when suffering it. United have agreed a £43.5million fee with Monaco to make Falcao’s loan move permanent and the option is there to send him back if things don’t work out. If they do, though, it is still a huge outlay on a player for whom they could never recoup that amount.

Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal looks on as his team prepare for Sunday's match against Chelsea . United duo Tyler Blackett (left) and Luke Shaw look focused as they take part in Van Gaal's training session . There will come a point in the next couple of years when United have to replace Van Persie, Rooney and Falcao but, to do that, they are going to have to spend in excess of £80m to bring in two strikers. It makes you wonder, then, why Van Gaal was so quick to off-load Danny Welbeck to Arsenal. Van Gaal was brutal when saying the England striker was ‘below United’s standards’, but doesn’t the manager have a reputation for improving young players? Welbeck might not have the pedigree of the others but he has got pace and youth — qualities United could do with — and his total of six goals for Arsenal already is as many as Falcao (one), Van Persie (two) and Rooney (three) have scored between them so far. Like United’s defenders, Welbeck’s best years are in front of him and that decision to sell him may one day be a cause for regret. If the present is about how Van Gaal organises his defence, the future is going to be about how he replaces his attack. It won’t come cheap.

Another week passes and again Mario Balotelli is in the news, this time for his decision to swap shirts with Pepe. The incident has been blown out of proportion. Had Balotelli actively looked to take Pepe’s shirt, my blood would have been boiling. The reason there has been such anger is that a player swapping shirts at half-time suggests their mind is not on the job. But look at the clips again. Balotelli has his head bowed and Pepe asks for his shirt, not vice-versa. It makes the situation completely different. This wasn’t like Arsenal’s Andre Santos getting Robin van Persie’s jersey or the incident with Mamadou Sakho, another Liverpool player, and Samuel Eto’o. Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli (second left) is approached by Pepe (second right) as he leaves the pitch . Balotelli and Pepe swap shirts as they head towards the tunnel at half-time of the Champions League clash . Pepe puts his arm round Balotelli's shoulder before the Liverpool striker is replaced on Wednesday . Balotelli was not souvenir-hunting and you can see from his reaction that he has little interest in taking Pepe’s shirt. On this occasion, he genuinely looked to be minding his own business and had not walked off the pitch pestering Pepe. All he has been guilty of on this occasion is naivety. If he had walked another three or four steps down the tunnel, we would never have known. If he had thought properly, he could have done what Steven Gerrard did with Alvaro Arbeloa and taken Pepe’s shirt after the game. Looking at the bigger picture, though, his form and body language have been as underwhelming as it was when he played for Manchester City. So why did Liverpool buy him? I am not alone in thinking he will not be at Anfield next season and that raises another question: how do they sell him?

Balotelli (right) is put under pressure by team-mate Jordan Williams as Liverpool prepare for the weekend . This week I'm looking forward to... ... Luis Suarez's Barcelona debut. It is great to see my old team-mate back in action and Luis Enrique, Barcelona’s coach, has stated that Suarez will feature at some point in el clasico. This is the biggest game in football, contested by the two most glamorous clubs on the globe and has always featured the best players in the world. I’ve been to a couple of games and the atmosphere is extraordinary. Luis certainly deserves his place on this stage. I can’t help but wonder, though, where he is going to fit into Barcelona’s team. Luis Enrique has been coy, not giving any clue about whether Luis will start at the Bernabeu this evening, but he has no need to rush him into the action. Luis Suarez looks in good spirits as he chats with Gerard Pique (centre) and Lionel Messi (right) on Friday . Suarez (front) is watched by Barcelona coach Luis Enrique (right) during training ahead of El Clasico . Barcelona are top of the table and Lionel Messi and Neymar are both in top form, so it is not as if they are crying out for a massive lift. Neither of those players are going to make way for him, so the most obvious place for him is the one Pedro occupies. The problem with that, however, is the fact it is on the right. I said when Luis left Liverpool that I could not see him playing in the role he did at Anfield and I stand by that. It will be fascinating to see how he makes the adjustment.

"Considering the weight of opposition building up against them over the Ched Evans controversy, taking on the 11 men of Walsall must have felt like an altogether more even contest for Sheffield United. As the issue escalated dramatically on Wednesday, those taking a stand against the decision to allow the convicted rapist to train with his old club included the Deputy Prime Minister, a local MP, a Sky Sports News presenter, a 1960s pop star and two club sponsors, not to mention 157,000 people who have signed a petition. Against this rather toxic backdrop, Nigel Clough and his team had to play a Johnstone’s Paint Trophy Northern Area quarter-final against Walsall at the Banks’s Stadium. They lost it 1-0. Ched Evans will start training with his former club, despite opposition from some Sheffield United fans . Evans is to marry his fiancee Natasha Massey after proposing shortly after he was released from prison . Sheffield United manager Nigel Clough has said Evans' future is 'nowhere near being decided' 'I think the owners need to think really long and hard about the fact that when you take a footballer on, you are not taking just a footballer these days, you are also taking on a role model,' Clegg told LBC Radio. 'You are taking on a role model, particularly for a lot of young boys who look up to their heroes on a football pitch in a team like that, and he has committed a very serious crime. 'It is for the football club to decide, but I really do think that footballers these days, they are major public figures who have a public responsibility to set an example for other people. 'I'm sure that will weigh heavily in the decisions made by the owners of Sheffield United.' Clough maintains that a permanent return for Evans is ‘nowhere near being decided’, but there will surely come a point when the club have to assess if it is really worth the trouble. After the match, the manager was asked if there is a danger of the club’s reputation being damaged. ‘You’ll have to speak to the owners about that,’ said Clough. ‘It’s their sphere of influence rather than us trying to win football matches. Nothing’s changed.’ For a few hours at least, football was back on the agenda with 500 Blades fans making the trip to the Midlands. There was no repeat of the pro-Evans chants that have been heard since his release from prison last month. After another day of moral debate, it was back to business. The Sheffield United players are expected in for a warm-down on Thursday. Although Evans has not trained with the first-team squad yet, it is understood that he has already done some light exercise at his old club as he tries to regain fitness after serving half of his five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old woman in a Rhyl hotel room. One dressing-room source said that the players are open-minded about the possibility of Evans rejoining the club who paid him £20,000-a-week before his incarceration in April 2012. That is not a mood shared by an increasingly vocal opposition to the idea of such a move. Charlie Webster has decided to resign from her role as patron of Sheffield United after Evans' return . While the Professional Footballers’ Association, who first approached Sheffield United about allowing Evans to train with them, and the club itself have acknowledged the 25-year-old’s right to rehabilitation after serving his punishment, those set against it are concerned by the former Wales striker’s apparent lack of remorse. Evans has apologised to his girlfriend Natasha Massey for being unfaithful but has always maintained that he is innocent of rape. His application to appeal is expected to be heard by the Criminal Case Review Commission in the next three months. Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister and Sheffield Hallam MP, urged the League One club to ‘think long and hard’ about taking him back. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg does not believe Evans should be given the chance to return to the club . Paul Blomfield, the Labour MP for Sheffield Central and a club shareholder, went a step further by writing an open letter to Sheffield United’s co-chairmen Kevin McCabe and Jim Phipps. He wrote: ‘The way this issue has been handled by the club is dragging our name through the mud and dividing fans. I really hope that you will reflect further and change your mind.’ That followed Sky Sports News presenter Charlie Webster becoming the first of three club patrons to resign over the issue. Webster, who has previously revealed that she was sexually abused as a teenager, said: ‘I don't believe it is morally right for a convicted rapist, who has still shown no remorse, to go and train with the club because it is trivialising rape. ‘I feel really uneasy that a convicted rapist will be possibly be cheered on by the next generation, by young men that at that moment in time, are still making decisions on how to treat women and what sexual consent is.’ Another Sheffield United patron, 60s singer Dave Berry, stood down because he ‘needed to take a moral stand’, and school food health expert Lindsay Graham followed suit citing personal reasons. Meanwhile two of the club’s main sponsors, John Holland Sales Ltd and DBL Logistics, also warned that they would re-evaluate their deals if Evans is re-signed. As he builds towards a possible comeback, the storm gathering around him is showing no signs of going away. VIDEO Ched Evans training with Sheffield United .

"There's a new must-have shoe on the red carpet these days, and it has nothing to do with red soles. The Lana heels, from small London label Bionda Castana, haves been seen on everyone from Zoe Saldana and Anna Paquin to Emma Roberts and Eva Mendes in recent months. The list doesn't end there. Kate Bosworth wore them to the launch of her Style Thief app, Olivia Palermo for her Brides magazine cover shoot, and Cheryl Cole for her birthday in June. Scroll down for video .

Lizzy Caplan, Gemma Arterton and Zoey Deutch have also been pictured out and about in their Lanas. Indeed, for the coolest Hollywood starlets, it has become almost de rigueur to be seen sporting a pair. With its pointed toe and ankle tie, the £485 ($800) pump is certainly versatile, and the fact that it comes in multiple colourways has made it a popular choice with celebrity stylists. The label was founded by friends Natalia Barbieri and Jennifer Portman who bonded over their shared Italian heritage. The name Bionda Castana means Blonde (Jennifer) Brunette (Natalia) in Italian. Their shoes are designed in London and made by hand in Italy .

Natalia tells MailOnline that the Lana pumps were designed with Lana del Rey in mind, calling the singer 'the epitome of cool'. She believes the style has been as successful as it is because it is classic without being too understated. 'Lana is our take on the classic single sole pump,' she said. 'This particular shape and style is very on trend. It is not 'plain' yet works in the same capacity as a 'plain' pump would with added cool.' And, she promises, the Lana heels are comfortable too. 'The fabrication of the style is popular because it is breathable,' she explained.

Making a point: Actress Anna Paquin pictured in her red Lanas while speaking with co-star and husband Stephen Moyer at the Apple store in SoHo, New York in July . 'Epitome of cool': The Lana shoe was inspired by singer Lana Del Rey . 'When wearing heels, our feet naturally swell, but the soft mesh at the front of the toes keeps our feet comfortable and this style doesn't rub in the same way a leather-lined pump would in warm weather and after long wear.' The graphic triangle motif, Natalia adds, is inspired by modern architecture, 'but [we] take it to a feminine level as opposed to taking it the other way which would be heavy, chunky, eccentric.' The Bionda Castana celebrity love doesn't end at Lana. Countless other Hollywood feet have been seen in other designs. Rachel Bilson, for example, has worn her Rosario shoes on the red carpet. Jennifer Lopez, Amanda Seyfried, Kerry Washington and Sophia Bush have all been seen in the Daphne Bis style and Alexa Chung can't stop wearing her Nicole heels. Lea Michele wears the Rosario, Elisabeth Moss has stepped out in the Renee and Rosario Dawson wore the Elisabetta earlier this year. Bionda Castana isn't the only emerging new footwear label to have generated industry attention of late. Over the past couple of seasons, three others have been making waves among fashion editors. Here are the names you need to know: . Dazzling: Mo Helmi's Lupe boot, £445, Mohelmi.com . Mo Helmi . The London-based designer is a new name on the footwear scene, but he looks set to become a familiar one. Helmi's shoes are made in the same Italian factory as Dolce & Gabbana, Bottega Veneta and Jimmy Choo and is run by three generations of the same family. And it seems his visits cause quite a spectacle - he told MailOnline: 'I make the fitting models run across the factory floor to check if they are comfortable but still hold on firm to the feet. I always say to them, ""Pretend you are running late for a show, or after a taxi!"" A favorite from his newest collection is the dazzling navy suede and navy/purple glitter Lupe boot, pictured right.

"The internet is facing its biggest ever threat, thanks in part of Facebook and Apple, the co-founder of Google has claimed. Sergey Brin said government attempts to control web access and the rise of the increasingly 'restrictive' Facebook and Apple platforms threaten freedom of information online. Mr Brin also said attempts by the entertainment industry to crack down on piracy have led to the U.S. using the same technology and approach it has criticised China and Iran for using. Google co-founder Sergey Brin, pictured left with co-founder Larry Page, said governments, Apple and Facebook are all threatening Internet freedom . Mr Brin told The Guardian: 'There are . very powerful forces that have lined up against the open Internet on all . sides and around the world. 'I am more worried than I have been in the past. It's scary.' Mr Brin said the rise of 'walled . garden' like Facebook and Apple, which tightly control what software can . be released on their platforms, were restricting innovation online. Both platforms have risen to become . consumer giants with their own proprietary platforms which control . access to their users and data. The 38-year-old told The Guardian that . he and Google co-founder Larry Page could not have created their search . engine if the internet was dominated by Facebook. With data stored on Facebook apps not . searchable and only accessible to closed, restricted networks of users, . the increasingly closed nature of the web risked stifline innovation, he . said. 'There's a lot to be lost,' he said. 'For example all the information in apps — that data is not ""crawlable"" by web crawlers. You can't search it.' Mr Brin's criticism of Apple and Facebook was part of an alarming portrait he painted of the current internet landscape. He also said the original open ethos . championed by internet pioneers was under threat from plans by . governments to monitor web use and attempts by entertainment companies . to push through new laws allowing them to demand the closure of pirate . websites. Restrictive: Facebook and Apple both tightly control software on their platforms and access to their users . China has recently introduced 'real . identity' rules in a bid to rein in microbloggers who have become . increasingly critical of the regime, while Russian bloggers who helped . foment protests against Vladimir Putin are facing increased pressure . from the Kremlin. Iran is reportedly planning to . introduce a sealed 'national internet' from this summer, while the UK . government has announced plans to monitor citizens' use of email and . social networks. Mr Brin said five years ago he did not . believe China or any country could effectively restrict the Internet . for long but he had been proven wrong. 'I thought there was no way to put the . genie back in the bottle, but now it seems in certain areas the genie . has been put back in the bottle,' Mr Brin said. He cited China, Saudi Arabia and Iran as the greatest threats. In the U.S., the entertainment . industry, he said, is failing to understand that users will continue to . download pirated content as long as it is easier to acquire and use than . legitimately obtained material. 'I haven't tried it for many years but . when you go on a pirate website, you choose what you like, it downloads . to the device of your choice and it will just work - and then when you . have to jump through all these hoops (to buy legitimate content), the . walls created are disincentives for people to buy.' Some will take Mr Brin's comments on . Google rival Facebook, which has seen huge growth and now has more than . 800 million members globally, with a grain of salt. The social network . has announced plans for a $100 billion IPO. But his comments on increased . interference by governments were echoed by Ricken Patel, co-founder of . Avaaz, the 14-million strong activist network which has help train and . equip activists in Syria. Mr Patel said: 'Governments are . realising the power of this medium to organise people and they are . trying to clamp down across the world, not just in places like China and . North Korea; we're seeing bills in the United States, in Italy, all . across the world.' Mr Brin also conceded that Google has . itself lost the trust of many because its servers sit on American soil, . and users' data are in reach of U.S. authorities.

The FaceRig software, which has yet to be released, allows users to adopt the appearance of any character, such as this red panda, which immediately mimics their expressions in online chats . The software tracks a person’s expressions and head movements. It extracts tracked data to apply the animation on a 3D model that a user has selected in realtime. The software uses a normal webcam and can work alongside video chat services such as Skype as well as in web cast games. Users can alter the sound of their voice and even use a karaoke mode. People can change the way their avatar is lit as well as any props they might carry. They can choose characters including a Japanese school girl, a horned demon and a red panda. This technology will allow users to ‘become digital actors on a virtual movie set’. Developed by five ex-game developers in Bucharest, Romania, the programme will be able to be used with Skype or any other webcam service when it is released. It will go on sale by August for as little as $5 (£3) for early adopters, although the price will rise as the programme becomes more sophisticated. Developers Holotech Studios claim they have created the world's first mass-marketed expression capture software. The early version of the service could be . used in web chats and webcast games and will allow users to change their . voice, choose environments and ‘dramatic lighting’ as well as create . their own props and characters to share with friends. Users will be able to choose from avatars such as  a Japanese Manga character (left) to a horned demon (right) as well as create their own to share with friends. The Avatars can carry props to add interest to web chats . The software, which is still in development stage, uses state-of-the-art realtime image tracking technology created by Swedish firm Visage Technologies and combines it with a realtime animations framework developed by their own company, Holotech Studios, along with other partners in the gaming industry. Realtime tracking collects and analyses data about a person’s facial expressions and head movements to apply the information onto a 3D model or avatar, such as a red panda. The software also encodes the video and audio output from a webcam to intercept and swap the images captured by the real webcam and the avatar. Here Facerig's soldier avatar allows webcam users to transform themselves into military men.

Clever software captures facial expressions using an ordinary webcam and reproduces them instantly on the face of a chosen character or avatar, which allows users to 'become digital actors on a virtual movie set' The team of scientists said: ‘A lot of research has been put into FaceRig by top level academics and professionals to create the current results.’ The current version of the software slated to be released this summer is intended for home use, but the company is also working on a version that could be used by businesses as well as a mobile version for iPhones and Android handsets. All users will need to do to use the package is download the software and sit in front of their webcam, according to the company. Depending on the success of their Indiegogo campaign, the team plans on supporting more sensors so that avatars can track torso and waist movements as well as gestures made by arms, hands and fingers. They said a future version of the software could even track brainwaves to pick up on the subject’s excitement so the avatar can show accurate pupil dilation or blushing.

There's even a karaoke feature (pictured) The crowd funding campaign has already exceeded its $120,000 target by pulling in $211,615 of investment. ‘Ultimately we want to enable anyone to become any digital character they wish, head to toe, with Hollywood/Pixar quality, during any real-time online interactions, video and audio,’ the developers said. ‘But this is super-long term. Right now we're starting with emotions [and] expressions on FaceRig,’ they added.

"For Holly Greenhow, seven, everything from speaking to sitting up is a challenge - all because she was born with athetoid cerebral palsy. But brave Holly, from Cambridgeshire, has refused to let her disability hold her back and has landed a starring role in Boden's new childrenswear campaign. Holly, whose condition was caused by a prolonged loss of oxygen at birth, was chosen after attending a casting earlier this year, where she shone in front of the camera. Brave: Holly Greenhow won't let being born disabled hold her back and appears in a new Mini Boden campaign . Proud: Holly's mother Fiona, 42, is thrilled that her daughter has been able to experience modelling for Boden . She spent a day in London modelling clothes from the Boden children’s range and now features in the Meet and Greet mini campaign on their website. In the Q&A accompanying the campaign, Holly charmingly reveals that the funniest person she knows is her mother and that she would choose to play all day if she ruled the world. 'Holly has a beautiful smile and modelling is not all about being perfect, so we thought why shouldn’t she be considered,' said her mother Fiona, 42. 'There are lots of things she can’t do and will never be able to do because of her disabilities, so it was really nice for her to have this experience. 'I hope it will help the image of disabled children and also open people’s eyes to the fact there are lots of children out there who aren’t perfect.' Holly, who has a 10-year-old brother named Oliver, was born with athetoid cerebral palsy, which affects her movement, balance and speech. She uses a wheelchair to get around and has only recently started to communicate using a special computer system operated by her eyes -  similar to that used by physicist Professor Steven Hawking who suffers from Motor Neurone Disease. Challenge: Because of her condition, Holly is unable to walk and can only talk using an eye-operated computer . Adorable: Boden say they are thrilled that Holly made the cut during an open casting held last May . But the seven-year-old has always enjoyed choosing her own clothes, so her mother thought she might like to try modelling. 'My mum suggested it as Holly loves pretty clothes and particularly likes wearing those designed by Boden,' explained Fiona, a trade manager for Tesco. 'Holly has so many things against her and as her mother I just wanted her to be able to do something that any child could or would love to do, given the chance. 'She went for a casting in April and did the shoot in the summer holidays with lots of other children at a studio in London. 'Holly really enjoyed it and loved being the centre of attention and we’re really pleased with the finished results.' Fiona, whose husband Paul, 45, is head . of sales for a food manufacturer, hopes that Holly may now have the . chance to do some more modelling work, following in the footsteps of . other disabled child models such as Seb White who appeared in Marks . & Spencer's 2012 Christmas campaign. Pioneer: Seb White (right), who has Down's Syndrome, appeared in last year's M&S Christmas campaign . Zena Botha, the studio shoot and model manager for Boden, said the company 'was delighted that Holly made the cut.' She added: 'We are always happy to invite our Mini Boden fans along to model castings and we were delighted that Holly made the cut. 'Holly was charming and we’re very pleased with the shoot, which is live now on boden.co.uk.' Matt Jackson, head of campaigns at the disability charity Scope said: 'There has certainly been a lack of diversity in kids modelling campaigns to date, which means that disabled children are often not represented. 'The fact that Holly has cerebral palsy and will feature in Boden’s advertising will certainly help to challenge some of the misunderstandings and prejudice that can make life difficult for so many disabled children.'","Holly Greenhow, seven, was born with athenoid cerebral palsy .

"Gisele Bundchen has topped Forbes' list of highest-paid models for the eighth year running. The Brazilian beauty, 34, has earned $47million over the past year - $16million more than her New England Patriots quarterback husband, Tom Brady. The mother-of-two's impressive pre-tax earnings were credited to high-profile modelling campaigns for H&M, Chanel, and Carolina Herrera, as well as her work as the U.S. face of Pantene and the face of Oral-B in Brazil. The face of fortune: Gisele Bundchen has topped Forbes' list of highest-paid models for the eighth year running - out-earning her NFL quarterback husband Tom Brady by $16million . Gisele's commercial savvy has also seen her profit from her partnerships with Brazilian shoemaker Grendene and a lingerie collection with Brazilian intimates firm, Hope. Forbes estimates that contrary to Linda Evangelista's famous statement that she wouldn't get out of bed for less than $10,000 a day, Gisele does not get out of bed for less than $128,000 a day. Legs for days: Gisele's latest ad for Stuart Weitzman shows off the body that made her $47million in one year .

Forbes calculated each model's earnings from June 2013 to June 2014 taking into account income from cosmetics, endorsements, advertising and fragrance deals . And Gisele far out-earns her fellow models. She made over five times more than Doutzen Kroes, 29, and Adriana Lima, 33, who came in joint second place on the list with past year earnings of $8million each. This year saw Sports Illustrated cover girl Kate Upton, 22, make her first appearance on the list, with earnings of $7million in the past year. She matched those of British beauty Kate Moss, 40, Australian supermodel Miranda Kerr, 31 and dimpled Chinese catwalk regular Liu Wen, 26. Victoria's Secret Angels dominated the rest of the list: Alessandra Ambrosio ($5m), Karlie Kloss ($4m), Candice Swanepoel ($3m) and Erin Heatherton ($3m). This month's Vanity Fair cover girl and mother-of-four Natalia Vodianova managed to make $4million last year - despite being pregnant for much of it. And Cara Delevingne, whose face seems to have been everywhere this past year, ranked among the high-earners with $3.5million. What's their Secret?

"When laughter is forced, it activates a part of the brain linked with deciphering emotions. Genuine laughter lights up parts linked with happiness . Next time your boss tells a bad joke and you feel compelled to laugh, beware - they can tell you're faking it. Researchers from London have discovered our brains carry out different process when we hear genuine laughter compared to fake chuckles. When laughter is forced, for example, it activates a part of the brain linked with deciphering emotions. This means we know it's not a genuine laugh, and we automatically try to work out why they're faking it, what the laugh means and what the they're thinking. While genuine laughter lights up areas of the brain linked with happiness and positive emotions. To test the theory, psychologist Dr Carolyn McGettigan from the Royal Holloway University of London measured brain responses of volunteers as they listened to genuine laughter on YouTube clips. Each participant was asked to pick clips they found funny. This ranged from comedy shows, such as Flight Of The Conchords, and even the Eurovision Song Contest. The results were then compared to how their brains responded to fake laughter. The findings revealed participants, none of which were told the study was about laughter perception, could unconsciously tell when the chuckles were insincere. Dr McGettigan said: 'It's fascinating to consider the way our brain is able to detect genuine happiness in other people. 'Our brains are very sensitive to the social and emotional significance of laughter. 'During our study, when participants heard a laugh that was posed, they activated regions of the brain associated with mentalising in an attempt to understand the other person's emotional and mental state.' To test the theory, researchers measured brain responses of volunteers as they listened to genuine laughter on YouTube clips. Each participant was asked to pick clips they found funny. This ranged from comedy shows, such as Flight Of The Conchords, pictured, and even the Eurovision Song Contest . Researchers from Indiana State University found that with laughter can boost the immune system by up to 40 per cent. The study tested 33 healthy women. Half of the women watched a comedy video together while the others watched a dull video on tourism. When . the films were over, scientists took samples of the women's immune . cells, known as natural killer cells, and mixed them with cancer cells . to see how effectively they attacked the disease. They . found that the women who had found the comedy funny enough to laugh out . loud had significantly healthier immune systems afterwards than those . who had watched the tourism film. The study goes a long way to explain why people can easily spot when someone is forcing laughter. Dr McGettigan added: 'Some of the participants engaged parts of the brain that also control movements and detect sensation. 'These individuals were more accurate at telling which of the laughs were posed, and which were real, when we tested them after their scan. 'This suggests that as listeners, 'trying out' how a laugh would feel if we produced it ourselves might be a useful mechanism for understanding its meaning.' The study was commissioned for the second annual International Day of Happiness on Wednesday. Dr McGettigan's findings confirm previous research from scientists at the University of . Tuebingen in Germany who investigated the 'laughter perception network' of the brain. Lead researcher Dr Dirk Wildgruber found that parts of our brains sensitive to processing high-level, social information reacted most to 'joyous' and 'taunting' laughter. Wildgruber's study said this is proof the brain is able to recognise the difference between types of laughter, and whether we're being laughed at, or laughed with. Yet, . regions of our brain that are more sensitive to picking up and . registering more complex sounds reacted most to 'tickling' laughter.","Study found our brains respond differently to genuine and fake laughter .

"If you thought the running shoes with toes were strange, wait until you see what the man behind the wacky design has come up with now: the hoof. Instead of each toe nestling in its own cosy compartment like the fingers of a glove, the new range of running shoes from TopPo Athletic goes minimal, creating only one separate space for the big toe and relegating the remaining four digits to a shared compartment. The design is based on the Japanese tabi, a soft shoe that is more like a sturdy sock. The new split-toe shoes are being launched this week at a trade fair in Salt Lake City, Utah, and will go on sale later this year . A more robust version, the tabi shoe, is . made of heavy material, often with rubber soles that give the wearer a . tactile contact with the ground. The separated toe means the wearer can make more agile use of their feet. The shoes are often used by workmen including rickshaw-pullers and construction workers. The concept isn't new: Nike released a split-toe running shoe back in the 1990s, the Air Rift. And even before that, back in 1951, Japanese runner Shigeki Tanaka won the Boston marathon wearing a pair of canvas split-toe tabi socks. However, Tony Post, an athlete himself and the former head of Vibram, the company that gave the world the Vibram running shoes, has now set up Topa Athletic to market the split-toe running shoe to the masses. The unloved finger running shoes from Vibram were among the 'terrible things that should end in 2013', according to a gossip website . The new shoe is a fusion of human biomechanics and modern technology: the laces on the lightweight RT model will be made of thin steel fibres with a nylon coating, and will close by turning a dial on the outer side of the shoe. The design is an important anchor point for the foot, Post told Runner's World Newswire. 'In a shoe with a roomy forefoot, you lack security, especially going downhill,' he said. Barefoot running came to the world's attention when Olympic runners Zola Budd and Abebe Bikila took part in races barefoot. The human foot is of course designed to be walked - and run - on. It is very efficient at absorbing the shock of landing and turning the energy of the fall into forward motion. The foot of a runner who usually wears shoes lands with an initial heel strike, while the foot of a barefoot runner lands with a more springy step on the middle, or on the ball of the foot. Running in shoes also appears to increase the risk of ankle sprains and other chronic injuries. The running shoe itself has also been implicated in causing injuries. One 1991 study found that wearers of expensive running shoes with special features such as added cushioning or pronation correction, could actually be worse for you than cheaper shoes. But of course running shoes protect the feet from injury and the weather. The split between the big toe and the other digits mean that the toes can spread naturally while preventing the foot from sliding around inside the shoe. Post promises that this is 'not another toe shoe'. The aim, he told Wired, is to 'try to work with what nature gave you'.The shoes will 'amplify your natural movements'. Post is no stranger to controversy. His Vibram FiveFingers shoes - the ones that separate the toes into cosy compartments of their own - sparked scepticism when they debuted. And just this week, they were included in a list of 'terrible things that must end in 2013'. 'These are revolting,' said gossip website Gawker. The Vibram shoes were designed to replicate the benefits of running barefoot. One of the first athletes to stun his opponents by running barefoot was Abebe Bikila of Ethiopia, who won the Rome Olympics marathon in 1960. Ray Puckett, one of the other competitors, remembers looking at his bare feet and thinking: 'Oh well, that's one we can beat.' The new split-toe shoes will be launched at a trade show in Salt Lake City, Utah, this week, and are then expected to go on sale later this year.","Split-toe shoes are based on an ancient Japanese design .

"As the Mini Style Hacker, Ryker Wixom's impressive Blue Steel has already won his Instagram account over 200,000 followers. But it seems the four-year-old, from Los Angeles, California, has plenty of opinions about the clothes he models, too. In a new shoot for zulily, he poses in mom Collette's favorite fall must-haves. But while her praise is largely for items that marry versatility and durability with style, Ryker has different reasons for liking his clothes. Scroll down for video . Ryker's choice: 'Wait, are these two jackets or one? It has a hood… I think it’s gonna rain! I love the hood. I can’t wait for it to rain!' Faux leather patches on a pair of jogger pants, for instance, are great only because they 'have leg shields so I can joust on a horse.' A classic button-down is hailed a 'Daddy shirt' and T-shirts only pass muster if they are funny (in this instance, pineapples and pandas wearing hipster glasses fit the bill). As far as Collette is concerned, denim, graphic T-shirts and button-down shirts form the basis of her boys' closets (she is also mother to two-year-old Grey) 'Every boy should own a button down,' she says. 'They are so versatile and comfortable. My boys wear them constantly!' Jogger sweats with faux leather patches: 'These pants have leg shields so I can joust on a horse' Button-down shirt: 'This shirt looks like a Daddy shirt. I am going to go to work with him when I wear it' Denim, she adds, is 'always on trend for kids - and T-shirts don't have to be boring. 'If my boys wear a graphic tee it has to be a great one!' she says. 'There are so many amazing designs out there that don’t just involve the usual kid characters.' The Mini Style Hacker Instagram shot to fame when Collette began posting photos of Ryker  copying the outfits and poses of celebrities and models. The mother-of-two, who works full-time in publishing and runs the blog and social media feeds in her free time, admits she never anticipated this level of success when she started sharing photos of her son online. Check blazer and pineapple tee: 'My friends at school like this jacket [Ryker wore it last week]. I wanna eat that pineapple but he has glasses on so I can’t' Velvet blazer: 'This jacket is cozy. It feels like Softy Pizza [Ryker’s favorite stuffed white tiger]' Polka dot blazer and panda tee: 'I like to wear shirts with funny stuff! The panda has a funny face and glasses. He also has a bumblebee on his tail, that’s why the jacket has polka dots' She writes on the Mini Style Hacker blog: 'We use our imaginations a ton and have a great time while doing so. If you see him with his hands in his pockets, he is holstering his imaginary laser guns. 'If you see him leaning against a wall, he is trying to push it over with his body weight.' Of course, it is a priority for Collette that the Mini Style Hacker project remains fun for Ryker. 'I don't want it to be something he doesn't like doing,' she said. 'He is a four-year old. He's not a model kid who will do whatever I say.' Family affair: Ryker's mother Collette Wixom is the real talent behind Mini Style Hacker.

"Australia has been dubbed the dirtiest country in the developed world and the Saudi Arabia of the South Pacific. The claims were made in reference to the federal government's decision to repeal a carbon tax on the nation's worst greenhouse gas polluters in a US-based technology magazine, Future Tense.

Scroll down for video . An article for US-based technology magazine, Future Tense, lists reasons why Australia became the worst polluter in the world, including a now-repealed decision to dump dredge on the Great Barrier Reef . 'Australians like to think of themselves as green. Their island country boasts some 3 million square miles of breathtaking landscape. They've had environmental regulations on the books since colonial times,' the article read. 'In 2007 they elected a party and a prime minister running on a 'pro-climate' platform, with promises to sign the Kyoto Protocol and pass sweeping environmental reforms. 'And yet, seven years later, Australia has thrown its environmentalism out the window - and into the landfill.' Brisbane is set to host the G-20 economic summit in November and the article claims Australian leaders plan to use their powers as host of the event to keep climate change off the agenda. Future Tense says Australia has thrown its environmentalism out the window and into the landfill, partly due to Prime Minister Tony Abbott and his government dismantling key environmental policies . 'Did we mention that Australians' per-capita carbon emissions are the highest of any major developed country in the world? Welcome to the Saudi Arabia of the South Pacific,' the article reads. The authors also draw on the now-repealed-decision to dump coal mine dredge near the heritage-listed Great Barrier Reef and the government's plan to open up the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area to commercial logging.

"As she weighs another bid for the White House, Hillary Rodham Clinton said Thursday she has a 'grandmother glow' that's fueling her campaign for female empowerment and gender equality around the world. Speaking to a national convention of female real estate professionals, the former secretary of state and potential 2016 Democratic presidential contender called on business and political leaders to close the gap in wages and leadership positions between men and women. Clinton, who joked that she felt that glow after the recent birth of her first grandchild, Charlotte, said she wanted all women to grow up in a world of 'full participation and shared prosperity.' Scroll down for video . Gushing about Charlotte: On Wednesday, Hillary spoke highly at a businesswomen's event of the effect her new granddaughter has had on her. Here, Clinton speaks before receiving a Lifetime Service Award on Wednesday from a national nonprofit organization that cares for families of America's fallen soldiers. 'I think my granddaughter has just as much God-given potential as a boy who was born in that hospital on the same day,' she said. In a speech that drew heavily on her own professional and personal experiences — including several references to her bruising presidential campaign in 2008 — Clinton said women face double standards in business and politics and that governments should work to enact policies that break down barriers to equal opportunity. Her remarks were met with standing ovations. 'These ceilings I'm describing don't just keep down women, they hold back entire economies and countries,' she said, 'because no country can truly thrive by denying the contributions of half of its people.' Clinton has repeatedly hit those themes as she travels the campaign trail to help Democrats in the midterm elections. On Thursday, she said the U.S. should eliminate what she called the 'motherhood penalty' by requiring paid leave for new mothers. The measure, she said, would pave the way for more women to participate in the workforce. Female empowerment: Speaking to a national convention of female real estate professionals, new grandmother and potential 2016 Democratic presidential contender called on business and political leaders to close the gap in wages and leadership positions between men and women . 'Laws matter,' Clinton said. 'I believe 100 percent in women being able to make responsible choices, but it's hardly a choice if you're working at a low-wage job, you get no leave and you can't even afford to bond with your baby because you have to get back to work.' Clinton was also in South Florida to promote her book about her tenure as the nation's top diplomat and to help Democrat Charlie Crist raise money for his gubernatorial campaign. Crist, a former Republican governor, is locked in a tight race with GOP Gov. Rick Scott, who has outspent the Democratic nominee by a 2-1 margin in television advertising. Clinton has said she expects to make a decision on a White House bid by the beginning of next year. The appearances help increase her exposure to voters in the nation's largest swing-voting state and allow her to reconnect with some of the same big-money donors who supported her and her husband's past political campaigns.

"Online retail giant Boohoo.com opens its first standalone store tomorrow, allowing fans of its fast fashion wares to shop them in real life for the first time. But instead of a location in its native UK, the Boohoo.com shop has popped up for the next two weeks in New York City - part of a major bid to capture the U.S. market. The two-level store, which is positioned among the designer boutiques of West Broadway, opened with a star-studded launch party last night, with guests including Jamie Chung, Femme and a live performance from Tanlines. British invasion: A Boohoo.com shop has popped up for the next two weeks in New York City - part of a major bid to capture the U.S. market . When shoppers are welcomed for the first time tomorrow however, they will find it stocked with highlights from the fall/winter collection. And with trend-led pieces costing from just $20, it looks set to become a fierce competitor in the U.S. to Forever 21 and H&M. In fact, a member of the PR team told MailOnline, no item ever costs more than $100. It is a formula that clearly works. The eight-year-old company reported revenues of £67million for the six month period to August 31. But future standalone stores are not part of the company's gameplan, says co-founder and CEO Carol Kane. Famous friends: The store launch party last night boasted guests including actress Jamie Chung . 'If I talk about our product strategy, it's of newness,' she told WWD.

"Couple married in October last year after much controversy . Duchess is worth over £3bn . 25 year age gap between duchess and third husband Diez . All of her six children campaigned against the marriage . She entered Vanity Fair's Best Dressed list in 2009 at the age of 83 . It is less than 12 months since the flamboyant Duchess of Alba married her toyboy in a fairytale ceremony - and it is clear that the two are determined to enjoy their first year of marriage. The 86-year-old Spanish Royal and her husband, 61-year-old Alfonso Diez, were today spotted enjoying a sunshine break on the island of Formentera. The two, accompanied by a friend, took a cooling dip in the sea and enjoyed strolls along the beach. With the typically extrovert duchess clad in a bright floral bikini and her friend in a cut-away cerise swimsuit, the threesome was sure to attract plenty of attention. The 86-year-old Duchess of Alba, Cayetana Fitz James, enjoys a dip in the ocean while on holiday in Formentera with her husband Alfonso Diez, 61, and a friend . Helping hand: The duchess held on to her two companions for support as they paddled in the sea . The duchess and Diez married after much controversy in a ceremony last October; the bride, an eccentric billionaire . with more titles than Queen Elizabeth II; her groom a civil servant young enough to be her son. Diez is the duchess's third husband and 25 years her junior. It emerged ahead of the wedding that . the twice-widowed duchess had divided her £3billion fortune between her six children to convince them that . her suitor was besotted with her rather than her money. Once they had realised the romance between their mother and Diez was becoming serious her children had mounted a campaign to block any possible marriage. They suggested publicly that she was emotionally unstable and even attempted to enlist the King of Spain in their efforts. The duchess's answer was to gift her five sons and daughter with their inheritance in advance. Diez also relinquished rights to his wife-to-be's fortune in an effort to appease her heirs and convince them that he was not a gold-digger. She did not give up her fortune . to marry, rather designated who it will go to once she dies and until . then remains in control of the House of Alba in its entirety. But her actions were enough to persuade most of Diez's detractors - and at least the four children that attended the wedding - that their love was real. The billionaire Spanish duchess married her toyboy in a ceremony last year . The duchess had to fight for her relationship to be accepted by her children, who thought Diez was a gold-digger . The colourful Royal wed her toyboy in a 15th century palace in Seville last . October. The eccentric Cayetana . Fitz-James Stuart wore a delicate pale pink gown designed by Victorio y . Lucchino for her third marriage, which took place in front of 38 guests. Well-wishers donned fancy dress and wigs in an attempt to copy her quirky style as they celebrated in the city’s streets. The duchess is a distant . relative of Winston Churchill and Princess Diana and is among Spain's most famous people. Known now for her frizzy white hair, . squeaky voice and wildly colourful clothes she entered Vanity Fair's International Best-Dressed list in 2009 at the age of 83. A bit of controversy is nothing new in the life of this multi-titled octogenarian. Last year, she was at the centre of a . sex scandal when Spanish magazine Interviu published a 30-year-old . picture on its front cover of the duchess sunbathing topless in Ibiza. And in July 2011 the duchess won damages of over . £250,000 from a TV station that claimed she cheated on her first husband . with a flamenco dancer. She doesn't really need the money though. Her fortune is estimated at around . £3billion but with a large chunk of her wealth tied up in property and . art the figure could be up to £2billion higher. Upon her death each of the duchess's . children is now guaranteed to receive significant properties: her . eldest, the future Duke of Alba, Carlos will become director of the Alba . foundation and control both the Palacio de Liria and the Palacio de . Monterrey, while the youngest and only daughter, Eugenia, gets a palace . in Ibiza and a vast estate in Andalusia. She and Diez, a social security . administration employee, are old acquaintances through her second . husband, who was a former priest, and Diez’s brother. They bumped into each other about three years ago outside a cinema in Madrid and eventually started dating.

"French fashion chain La Redoute has been left red-faced after it forgot to airbrush a naked bather from a promotional photograph for its children's clothes. The image, which appeared for several hours on its website today, showed a group of four children running on the sand. But, in the background, a naked man can clearly be seen wading behind them up the sea-shore. Scroll down for video... Embarrassing: The naked bather appears in the background of a La Redoute publicity shot which appeared on its website . Web users spotted the 'faux pas', which has since been taken down, and immediately took to Twitter to poke fun at the clothing company. One tweeter labelled it a 'SCANDALE' while another highlighted the 'EPIC FAIL de la Redoute!'. La Redoute immediately apologised for the mistake, but its website has now come under intense scrutiny from users who also discovered a spelling mistake on one of its T-shirts. Instead of having 'Enjoy Holidays' written on the garment, it actually says 'Enjoy Holydays'. Faux pas: One of La Redoute's T-shirts has Enjoy Holydays rather than Enjoy Holidays printed on it . The bather's identity has not yet been revealed, but he has already sprung to fame across the web with a series of mocking images being produced. Some keen photoshoppers have cut and paste famous people into the original image, which has seen President Nicolas Sarkozy and his wife Carla Bruni, and even late North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, taking his place. Others have placed a cut-out of the naked man in other situations, including a music festival and in someone's house.","Photograph appeared on La Redoute's website for several hours .

"A sensitive and peace-loving 16-year-old boy from an affluent Georgia suburb was fatally gunned down by a police sniper in his own house after he threatened to kill himself following a bad day at school. Young Andrew Messina cracked after receiving a bad grade and upon returning home he grabbed his parents .357 Magnum and told his mother he wanted to end his life. Panicked, she called the police to come and talk him down, but instead, an army of deputies, an armoured tank and a sniper arrived at their Towne Lake home who eventually shot the boy dead after he smashed a door window with the handgun. Scroll Down for Video . Lisa Messina (left) has spoken of her devastation at the death of her boy Andrew (right) who was shot dead by police after pulling a gun on himself at his Atlanta home . Andrew Messina was shot dead by a police sniper after the suicidal teen smashed his gun through a glass pane in his front door during a police stand off . Speaking out for the first time since the tragic May 1st accident at their Towne Lake home, Andrew's parents Nick and Lisa said they still struggled to believe the chain of events that led to their boy's death and the way that police have closed ranks since the fatal shooting. 'He just got sad and kind of down on himself and talked about running away. And that discussion turned to ending his life. And I wasn't home,' Nick Messina said to CBS Atlanta. 'It just happened so fast, and then he went upstairs. He has the gun in his hand, and he had bullets in the other hand,' Lisa Messina continued.Making a panicked 911 call, Lisa Messina was more concerned for her son's safety than her own. 'I need you to get away from him if you think he is going to shoot you,' said the 911 operator during tense call. 'I think he is going to shoot himself,' replied Lisa Messina. Concerned as to what the exact police response would be to her armed son, Lisa Messina wanted to know how many cars are coming. 'Just one, right?' said the worried mother. 'I'm not sure,' replied the operator . However, when asked by the operator if her son was 'out of his mind,' Messina’s mother said  'yeah.' The sensitive teenager had received a bad grade at school and the situation began to escalate when he grabbed a .357 magnum that was in his house . Lisa Messina and her husband Nick (right) have signaled their intention to sue Cherokee County Sheriff's department for mishandling their son's situation . Within minutes, the scene outside the Messina's picturesque home resembled a Hollywood movie, as a slew of officers arrived along with an armoured tank and a deadly police sniper. 'They brought an army to take out a 16-year-old boy. To kill a 16-year-old boy,' Nick Messina said. While Andrew was inside the house alone, he hooked up a video camera to record himself as he drunk a bottle of Martini and telephoned his distraught father outside. The harrowing footage of the boys last moments were made available to CBS Atlanta. 'You can't find anything worth living for with me?' said Nick Messina to his son. 'I don't know,' replied Andrew. 'Really?' said his father. 'I do know personally I really don't want to live. So you should just let this happen if you really love me,' said his son. The Towne Lake home where Andrew Messina, an Etowah High School sophomore, was shot once in the abdomen after a tense police stand-off . Andrew Messina can be seen hunched over brandishing a gun at his home in Towne Lake, Cherokee County. Police negotiators are situated just to the right of the door in the centre of the image . Police at the scene cut off that phone call and placed negotiators to the side of the front door within earshot of Andrew. 'They are still standing there,' an agitated Andrew can be observed to say on the video as he staggers around his house wielding the handgun and drinking directly from the bottle. 'Go away or do something, the tension is killing me.' As the home was surrounded by deputies in combat gear, Andrew can be seen to become ever more frightened in the video recording. 'We thought that they would (be) experts in being able to diffuse the situation. And that was not what happened. Instead of the fire being put out, they brought gasoline,' Nick Messina said. On the negotiation call, Andrew Messina said he wasn't involved in a riot, rather he was angry. 'Is that a riot shield? Yeah, that's a riot shield,' he said. 'This isn't a riot, this is one person who is pissed off.' Tragically for his parents, Andrew can be heard to ask to speak to his father several times. 'Hey, where's my dad? Isn't he supposed to be here?' he said. Police sniper Jason Yarbrough (left) was cleared of any criminal wrongdoing after an internal investigation of Cherokee County Sheriff's department which is headed by Roger Garrison . The Messina family lawyer Chuck Pekor is preparing to bring a lawsuit against the Cherokee County Sheriff's department . Just 15 minutes before their son was fatally shot, Andrew Messina's parents watched sniper, Jason Yarbrough walk by them with his rifle over his shoulder. 'I couldn't believe the gun he had,' Lisa Messina said. 'I said, 'Whoa, where is he going with that gun?' 'A minute later we heard this horrendous cannon shot and he was dead,' Nick Messina said. Cherokee County Sheriff Roger Garrison said that the 16-year-old boy had made an aggressive gesture by smashing through a glass window pane in the front door near to the negotiating teams. 'We would still be sitting there today if it weren't for that very, very aggressive act that he made of ramming the gun and a pistol straight through a glass door at our officers,' said Cherokee County Sheriff Roger Garrison, the day after the shooting. 'Had that officer not taken the action, there is a good chance one of those negotiators that was there who also has a family, also would not be going home today.' The popular teenager's death was was transported to WellStar Kennestone Hospital in Marietta after he was shot where he was later pronounced dead . However, the Messina's attorney Chuck Pekor believes that the police had no justification to shoot the suicidal teen. 'There is nobody in there with him. There is nobody at risk except himself. You just give it time, just wait,' Pekor said about the standoff which had lasted a little more than an hour. 'Not a single officer out there, not a one, ever saw the gun come through the hole where the break was.' Furthermore, Pekor finds irregularities with the account that he was directly threatening the negotiating team. This is because he was shot sideways through his abdomen, with the bullet entering his right side and exiting the left. This meant that the right handed boy would have been facing the opposite direction to the police team when he was shot. Furthermore, Yarbrough had only been on the scene for less than 20 minutes and has admitted he didn't even know if there was a hostage with the boy. An internal investigation by the Cherokee County Sheriff's Office and the district attorney both found there was no criminal wrongdoing by Yarbrough. However, the Messina's are in the process of filing a lawsuit againt the Cherokee County Sheriff's Office.","Andrew Messina became extremely emotional at his home in Towne Lake, Georgia after receiving a bad grade from school .

"A Tory MP and his estranged wife are involved in an extraordinary secret war on Wikipedia over who was to blame for the break-up of their marriage. Sondra Pritchard, wife of Mark Pritchard, used the website to accuse her husband of ‘abandoning her by text message after 16 years of marriage’ even though he claimed to be a ‘devout Christian’. Shortly afterwards the damaging entry was deleted and the Pritchards’ tit-for-tat Wiki war continued as the account of their split was changed on the MP’s profile, reflecting conflicting versions of events. Conflicting claims: Conservative MP Mark Pritchard shown here during a parliamentary debate, admits to sending the text but claims he had already told his wife face-to-face that he wanted a divorce . The Mail on Sunday has established most of the alterations were made from computers traced to the Houses of Parliament where both work – Mrs Pritchard as her husband’s Commons office manager. Even more remarkably, some of the anonymous Wiki entries appear to involve a code which echo opera buff Mr Pritchard’s role as treasurer of the Parliamentary opera group. One of the entries favourable to him was made by a user known as Figaro2000, after Mozart’s The Marriage of Figaro. Others which sided with Mrs Pritchard were made by La Verdad – Spanish for the truth. Former marketing director Mr Pritchard, 46, MP for The Wrekin in Shropshire, and his 47-year-old American-born wife have lived apart since April. In a statement yesterday, he confirmed he had texted her to say he wanted a divorce but claimed he had already informed her ‘in person’. He said: ‘I informed my ex-wife, in person, that I was going to file for divorce the day I left home. Over subsequent days, I confirmed that decision through another conversation, a legal letter, and by text. 'Since then, friends claim she may have abused the Wiki site to try to cause me embarrassment and make inaccurate claims. I did not edit any item on my Wiki page.’ The ‘text’ claim was added to Mr Pritchard’s profile on August 1: ‘The couple separated in April 2013, following Mr Pritchard, a devout Christian, abandoning Sondra and the marriage on 29th April by text.’ Mr Pritchard’s fightback started on August 6, when allegations against him were deleted by Figaro2000. The next day, an account of their divorce changed back in favour of Mrs Pritchard. It said: ‘Contrary to inaccurate press reports, [she] filed the divorce petition citing “Unreasonable Behavior”.[sic]’ A battle raged over this and the ‘text’ entry again on August 8. Eventually a user, Taggy456, had the last word by deleting reference to Mr Pritchard’s ‘unreasonable behaviour’. At present, there appears to be a truce, with no reference at all to Mrs Pritchard on the MP’s profile. Mr Pritchard declined to comment on whether he was Figaro2000. Sondra Pritchard could not be reached for comment last night.","Snubbed wife Sondra used Wikipedia entry to claim MP Mark Pritchard ended their 16 marriage by text message .

"Sarah Jessica Parker's second SJP shoe collection is here - and Carrie Bradshaw would be proud. The latest styles pay tribute to the actress's friends, as well as her New York City home. One statement boot, the 'Pat', is named after Sex And The City's legendary costume designer, Patricia Field, while the 'Serge' boot is named after her hair stylist Serge Normant. The line, available at Nordstrom, runs the gamut from Nineties classics (which, incidentally, are making a comeback) to rather more daring lace-up shoe-boots.

There are bags too - the name of the 'New Yorker' hobo speaks to aspiring Miss Bradshaws, while the 'Greenwich' tote is a more contemporary style that could well be named after the upscale Connecticut enclave, Greenwich Village or the street and avenue of the same name. The price point remains high for a celebrity line - $220 to $695 - but then it was developed with the help of Manolo Blahnik CEO, George Malkemus.

"The stones at Stonehenge could have been ‘played’ like a giant xylophone, a study has claimed. Researchers spent months tapping pieces of stone onto 1,000 types of rock and recording the sound they made. Most produced a muted ‘thud’, but bluestones from the Preseli hills in south Wales – where the monoliths are thought to have originated – ‘sing’ when struck. Singing stones: Bluestones from the Preseli hills in south Wales, from where Stonehenge's monoliths are thought to have originated, have an 'exceptional sonic nature', say researchers from the Royal College of Art . Their ‘exceptional sonic nature’ may explain why neolithic man carted the stones 200 miles to Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire more than 4,000 years ago to build Stonehenge. It may also shed light on their circle formation, with sound resonating among the stones when they were ‘played’. The startling conclusion was the result of a study by experts at the Royal College of Art rather than by archaeologists. They were even granted access to Stonehenge itself to play the structures like a giant xylophone, where they confirmed the rocks made a range of metallic sounds like bells, gongs and tin drums. Paul Devereux, who led the study with Jon Wozencroftfrom, said: 'There had to be something special about these rocks. 'Why the hell would you take them from Wales all the way to Salisbury otherwise? 'The one thing that hasn’t been considered until now is that sound may have been an important factor. 'We found it was a noteworthy soundscape, with a significant percentage of the actual rocks making metallic sounds like bells, gongs, tin drums, etc, when tapped with small, handheld ""hammerstones"". 'We have had percussionists up here who have been able to actually get proper tunes out of the rocks. This is real rock music.' Spiritual site: People watch the midsummer sun as it rises over Stonehenge on the Summer Solstice . The research team tested rocks from 1,000 different locations from around the UK to test their sonic abilities. They found that bluestones from the Preseli hills in Pembrokeshire, sounded like no other. English Heritage allowed the team to . acoustically test the bluestones at Stonehenge, effectively playing them . like a huge instrument. Pugh imagines a musical stonehenge . To the researchers’ surprise, several were found to make distinctive, if muted sounds, with several of the rocks showing evidence of having already been struck. The stones make different pitched noises in different places and different stones make different noises - ranging from a metallic to a wooden sound. The investigators believe that this could have been the prime reason behind the otherwise inexplicable transport of these stones nearly 200 miles from Preseli to Salisbury Plain. There were plentiful local rocks from which Stonehenge could have been built, yet the bluestones were considered special. Large chunks of rock missing from the stones would also suggest that they have been hit throughout their lifetime. A spokesman for the project said it was merely a pilot study - the phenomenon of the ‘sound of stone’ was being investigated for virtually the first time with the project. He said: 'The project is a pilot study of raw visual and acoustic elements mainly on and around the Carn Menyn ridge, Mynydd Preseli, south-west Wales, the source area of some of the Stonehenge bluestones, an area still relatively untouched by modern development. 'Sites in the surrounding Pembrokeshire countryside were also briefly visited. 'The project asked: ""What might Stone Age eyes and ears have perceived in this landscape, and what aspects made it become important to the builders of Stonehenge?""' Jon Wozencroft, who led the research, added: 'It was a really magical discovery and refreshing to come across a phenomenon you can’t explain.'","Royal College of Art researchers say that Preseli hills bluestones sound like no others tested from across the country .

"Suki Waterhouse has sparked rumours that she is to become a Victoria's Secret model after posting a photo of herself wearing giant feather wings on Instagram. The 22-year-old girlfriend of Bradley Cooper looked every inch the Angel in an elaborate peacock-inspired ensemble comprising a showstopping headdress and an embellished lattice-style bodice. While Victoria's Secret refused to confirm or deny the news, the photo lends heavy evidence to the rumour that Suki will be walking in the December 2nd show. Scroll down for video . Future Angel?

"A beach in San Francisco contains five times the safe levels of radiation fueling concerns that Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant’s crisis is impacting areas across the country. It comes just days after radiation readings were found to be double the normal amount in Missouri's recent snowfall. According to YouTube user, DutchSinse, who posted a video of him taking the Geiger readings in St Louis, the findings mean that ‘small particles of radioactive material are indeed coming down in the precipitation. Past tests show around 30CPM in the same spot on a nice day with no precipitation’. Scroll down for video...

In this picture the radiation device is in the foreground with the beach in the background . Higher near the water: Once the man approaches the water itself, the radiation spikes to at least 500 per cent safe levels . He said snowstorms in 2012 also showed alert level radiation readings. The San Francisco findings prompted federal officials to launch an investigation, according to Infowars.com. Health officials in San Mateo County confirmed the spike – which was reaching over 150 micro-REM per hour - but said they were ‘befuddled’ about what had caused it. A video shows a man measuring radiation readings at different spots on the beach south of Pillar Point Harbor. Background radiation in the areas immediately surrounding the beach are normal, but once the man approaches the water itself, the radiation spikes to at least 500 per cent safe levels and the Geiger counter’s alarm goes off. The man behind the video claims that on his previous visit to the same beach, radiation readings were 13 times the safe level. Double: Radiation counts per minute (CPM) taken in the snow this week in St Louis, Missouri, show levels double the normal numbers . Snowfall: The heavy snowfall in St Louis, Missouri, carried with it 'small particles of radioactive material' which made the numbers jump to double . Officials have dismissed the possibility that it could be linked to Fukushima radiation reaching the west coast, despite forecasts by experts last summer that radioactive particles from Fukushima would reach U.S. coastal waters in 2014. Last week RT reported that new plumes of radioactive steam were emerging from the crippled reactor number 3 at the plant, but TEPCO representatives refused to explain the cause. The Department of Health and Human Services has ordered 14 million doses of potassium iodide, the compound that protects the body from radioactive poisoning in the aftermath of severe nuclear accidents, but a DHHS official denied that the purchase was connected to the Fukushima crisis.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and state Department of Public Health are investigating the cause of the radiation on the San Francisco beach. More information is expected to be released this week. TEPCO and the Japanese government have repeatedly been caught lying in their efforts to downplay the scale of the Fukushima disaster. In September, a BBC report said that radiation readings around the power plant were 18 times higher than previously reported by TEPCO. And after a tank leaked 300 tonnes of toxic water in August, groundwater radiation readings at the plant soared to 400,000 becquerels per litre, the highest reading since the nuclear accident occurred in March 2011.","A San Francisco beach has five times the safe level fueling concerns over Fukushima's impact .

"Riots broke out in an Indian town after the discovery of the body of a seven-year-old girl who had been sexually assaulted and had her throat cut. Isha Chhagan Jain had been visiting the Kumar Resort in Lonavla, Maharashtra, for the wedding of a cousin. At around 9.30pm on Sunday her family realized she was missing and went to the police after they were unable to find her. Isha Chhagan Jain's body was found on the terrace of the popular Kumar Resort in Lonavla, Maharashtra . The owner of the resort Manohar Budhani admitted only two CCTV cameras were working when Isha died . It was not until Tuesday morning that her body was discovered rolled up in a carpet behind a solar panel on the resort terrace by a scrap vendor who went there to collect waste. Her throat had been cut with a sharp knife, she had been raped and there were cuts all over her body and her clothes were torn. Isha's father Chhagan Jain has been quoted as saying she was partially vision impaired and insisted on coming to the wedding even though he was concerned that she could not see properly. I S Patil, head of Lonavla city police, told the Times of India: 'The girl was present in the crowded hall when the suspect must have lured her to accompany him to the terrace and then killed her.' Isha's earrings were intact so robbery is not thought to be a likely motive. The idyllic hill town was rocked by riots, with protesters demanding the immediate arrest of a suspect . Lonavla is around 50 miles from Mumbai, the capital of Maharashtra. Protesters staged a rasta roko, in which a mass of people block traffic, on the Mumbai-Pune highway following Isha's murder . Protesters calling for the immediate arrest of a suspect threw rocks at the resort and were charged by baton-wielding police during ugly scenes in the hill station town. A group staged a rasta roko, in which a mass of people block traffic, on the Mumbai-Pune highway. Hotels, restaurants, shops and other business were closed for a day in protest. Isha's family looked for her throughout Sunday night and into Monday morning, but were reportedly not allowed to search the terrace. Family friend Manoj Jain said: 'We asked the resort officials to analyse CCTV footage, but we were told that most of the cameras installed in the resort were not functioning.' But Kumar Resort director Manohar Budhani claimed the terrace was searched on Monday night . Budhani only two CCTV cameras are working but said 65 new ones would be installed soon. Isha's body was taken to hospital for a postmortem.","Isha Chhagan Jain had been visiting the Kumar Resort in Lonavla, Maharashtra, for the wedding of a cousin when she was murdered .

"The shooting of President John F Kennedy, born on this day in 1917, remains one of the world’s most infamous assassinations, and its implications are still arguably being felt today. Aside from the conspiracy theories shrouding the event, the impact of his death on 22 November 1963 has been pored over and studied for decades. But what if he had never been shot by Lee Harvey Oswald? That was a question tackled by award-winning US television journalist Jeff Greenfield for All About History magazine issue 13, who considered how life in the following decades might have been different had Kennedy lived. What if JFK had never been killed? US television journalist Jeff Greenfield ponders the question for All About History magazine and discusses some of the implications if he had continued living into old age. Pictured is an artist's illustration of what Kennedy might have looked like in 1977 at the age of 60 . Greenfield postulates that the US might have been embroiled in fewer international conflicts had Kennedy remained president. But closer to home, a suspected affair with Marilyn Monroe would have shocked the public in the same way Clinton’s affair with Monica Lewinsky did. And civil rights also might have made less progress if he had continued as head of state. On the subject of the Cold War, Greenfield suggests that the terrifying events of the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 might have improved relations between the US and Russia. 'What if JFK had lived?' and much more is available to read in issue 13 of All About History, on sale today . ‘A lot of people look at the way Kennedy ran for president, very hawkish, very militant and in his inaugural speech he said he would pay any price, bear any burden,’ says Greenfield to All About History. ‘But they failed to recognise how much the Cuban missile crisis had affected him. ‘It’s pretty clear that he and Khrushchev [Former General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union] had come close to presiding over a nuclear holocaust, it dramatically changed the way he looked at the world. ‘That’s when he began looking for common ground with the Soviet Union: a test-ban treaty, possibly other steps to turn down the temperature of the Cold War.’ And in terms of the Vietnam War as well, events may have transpired in a more peaceful manner. ‘The evidence is, during the fall of 1963, Kennedy had realised that Vietnam was a losing proposition,’ continues Greenfield. ‘He had carelessly authorised - or didn’t stop - a coup that had put new people in charge of South Vietnam. ‘He saw this as a situation that violated a fundamental belief of his about committing large numbers of Americans to a land war in Asia. ‘He had always said to people that he wanted to disengage but he couldn’t do it until he was re-elected in 1964 - the politics wouldn’t let him. ‘He would have been accused of being soft on communism. ‘My best guess is that he would have played for time in 1964, tried to keep the status quo and tried to keep any incidents from arising. And ultimately, says Greenfield, ‘I think we would have been spared [an all-out] war in Vietnam.’ And, he continues, 'if we had been, the cultural clash in the US would have been very different in the late 1960s.’ While the so-called ‘Swinging Sixties’ would have still occurred, Greenfield suggests there wouldn’t have been groups vehemently protesting against the US military. The Vietnam War raged for many years and sparked huge protests across America. Greenfield suggests, though, that if Kennedy had remained president the war might not have happened as it did. Pictured is the 3rd Marine Division of the US Army in 1968 . One of the potential scandals that threatened to undermine JFK’s continued presidency was his rumoured affair with Marilyn Monroe. It’s believed they had an ongoing relationship, with Monroe even thinking at one stage JFK would divorce his wife Jackie and she would move into the White House as the First Lady. And Greenfield says that if this had become common knowledge to the public, it could have been akin to the scandal that engulfed President Clinton when his affair with Monica Lewinsky was revealed in 1998 - even though Monroe died in 1962. ‘I asked some people whether Kennedy could have survived this scandal ' they said “of course not”,’ says Greenfield. ‘The cultural climate of the US in [the early-1960s] compared to the 1990s was just radically different. ‘In 1964 we had a presidential candidate ' Nelson Rockefeller ' who lost a key presidential primary just as his wife gave birth to a baby and it reminded people that he had left his older wife for a younger woman. ‘We had never had a divorced president in 1964 and there was no idea of “oh well, it’s private, everybody plays around a bit"".' Greenfield adds it ‘would have been far more shocking’ than the Clinton scandal if Kennedy’s administration failed to prevent the story from becoming public, which would have been 'hard'. Kennedy was assassinated during a motorcade in Dealey Plaza, Dallas, Texas on Friday 22 November 1963 (pictured). Greenfield suggests that had he not been killed, he would have lived into moderate old age before succoming to one of the illnesses that ailed him in earlier life . Looking further into his life, Greenfield considers how his health might have curtailed his later years. ‘He suffered from all kinds of ailments,’ he explains. ‘He had Addison’s disease, he had horrible intestinal problems, he apparently had an untreated veneral disease and the combination of drugs he was taking for Addison’s with his injury from the war made his back [ache], just agony. ‘By the time he would have served a second term and in his early 50s, no one knows how his health would have been.’ And a final point Greenfield makes is on the subject of civil rights: would it have been such a big deal for Kennedy as it was for Lyndon Johnson? The Civil Rights Act of 1964 famously outlawed discrimination based on race, colour, religion or sex. But with Kennedy still president, it’s likely any such legislation wouldn’t have materialised until later. ‘Kennedy wasn’t as passionate about civil rights,’ says Greenfield. ‘He was also much more a foreign-policy president. ‘If Kennedy could have avoided the war in Vietnam at the cost of going easy on civil rights, he would have done it. ‘We would have gotten there eventually, but more slowly than it would have happened under Johnson.’ REAL TIMELINE .

"Most us have been left wondering, at some point, where the letters and packages that never reached the mailboix actually ended up. And for hundreds of unlucky people in western Kentucky, the answer was the basement of a vacant home that belonged to their mailman's dead mother. William 'Brent' Morse  has been convicted for destroying, hiding and delaying the delivery of U.S. mail, after some 44,900 pieces were found stashed in the basement and a rented storage unit. Federal sentencing guidelines called for the Dawson Springs man to get a two-year prison sentence, however the judge gave him six months in jail followed by six months home detention. Worst mailman ever?  Former United States Postal Service Employee William Morse, 34, from Dawson Springs, Kentucky was sentenced on April 17 to six months in prison followed by six months of home incarceration for destroying, hiding and delaying the delivery of at least 44,900 pieces of mail . The massive stash of mail was split between a storage unit (pictured) and the home of Morse's dead mother . Police caught Morse after the owner of the storage facility saw the door to his unit was ajar. When the man saw the Postal Service crates he called the police . The basement of the home that once belong to Morse's late mother was literally full on undelivered mail . The U.S. Postal Service say that all of the mail that was recovered has since been delivered to its rightful recipients . 'He wanted to speed up his route,' said Capt. Craig Patterson, the police officer who arrested Morse last year, according to USA Today. 'I think he was lazy.' Morse had been a letter carrier for five years. He has also been ordered to pay $14,808 in restitution that will be split between residents, a bank and two other businesses who were affected by his laziness. Morse's crime was uncovered when the owner of the storage facility found the door to his unit ajar. When the man saw U.S. Postal Service crates inside he called police. While other postal employees have been caught in the past dumping their deliveries, Morse's case seems to be significantly bigger. The New York Post reported in March that a Long Island letter carrier had been charged with throwing about 1,000 pieces of mail into trash bins. In Australia, The Age in Victoria reported last year that a carrier for Australia Post was charged after about 10,000 undelivered pieces of mail were found in his bedroom. Morse also was convicted of theft in state court for cashing about $31,000 in Social Security checks made out to his deceased mother . Morse's lawyer, federal public defender Patrick Bouldin, said that his client was going through a divorce, was responsible for picking up his children during the day, and would 'store' his mail if he hadn't finished delivering it. 'It's not that he was stealing anything from it,' said Bouldin. Morse was responsible for the delivery of 1.2 million pieces of mail during his tenure. Incredibly, the court heard how only a few of the 250 recipients on his route were financially affected. It was this number that helped with his reduced sentence. Morse also was convicted of theft in state court for cashing about $31,000 in Social Security checks made out to his deceased mother, Patterson said, and placed in diversion for five years, according to the Hopkins County commonwealth's attorney's office. U.S. Attorney David Hale said Morse dumped mail for two years, ending in March 2013, and destroyed at least 1,000 more pieces. All the mail that was recovered from Morse has delivered to its rightful recipients.","William Morse, 34, of Dawson Springs, Kentucky, had been dumping his deliveries for two years .

"A federal jury on Wednesday awarded $14.1 million to five Indian guest workers who claimed they were defrauded and made to live in squalid conditions after being lured to work for an Alabama-based marine and fabrication company following Hurricane Katrina. The jury issued its verdict against Mobile, Alabama-based Signal International LLC and its associates in a civil trial overseen by U.S. District Judge Susie Morgan. More than 200 other workers' claims are pending against the company, lawyers said. The plaintiffs sought compensatory and punitive damages. Indian H2B guest workers protest conditions at Signal International shipyard in 2008: A federal jury on Wednesday awarded $14.1 million to five workers who claimed they were defrauded and made to live in squalid conditions . The suit was filed in 2008, charging that Signal used the federal government's H-2B guest-worker program to recruit Indians to work as welders and pipefitters at its facilities in Pascagoula, Mississippi, and Orange, Texas. The suit alleged Signal falsely promised to help the workers apply for and receive green cards. But the plaintiffs claimed they were the victims of a labor-trafficking scheme by Signal, an immigration lawyer and an Indian labor recruiter. Signal faces paying $12 million of the damages, plaintiffs lawyers said. 'In short, these workers were sold a bill of goods,' said Alan Howard, a lawyer for Southern Poverty Law Center, an Alabama civil rights group that represented the Indian workers. 'They were victimized and exploited and really taken advantage of.' The plaintiffs claim they were charged $10,000 per person by recruiters who gave them false promises that they would be able to get green cards and obtain permanent residency in the United States. The suit accused Signal of housing the workers in squalid conditions and forcing them to pay $1,050 each a month to stay in dirty trailers . Based on those promises, the suit claims Indian workers went into debt to get the jobs for Signal and in some cases sold homes and gave up jobs in India before leaving for the Gulf Coast. Once they arrived, the guest workers claimed they were told they were going to get 10-month work permits. The suit also accused Signal of housing the workers in squalid conditions and forcing them to pay $1,050 each a month to stay in overcrowded and dirty trailers. Signal said in a statement that it 'strongly disagrees' with Wednesday's verdict and is considering an appeal. Howard said the cases of about 230 other workers are pending against Signal. An attempt to certify the Indian workers under a class-action suit was rejected by a federal judge. Signal hired about 500 workers to work at its facilities after Katrina. The company said it was facing a shortage of skilled workers following the 2005 hurricane and that it paid the Indian workers $18 an hour, the same as American workers would have received for the same jobs. Hurricane Katrina: Signal said it was facing a shortage of skilled workers following the 2005 hurricane and that it paid the Indian workers $18 an hour, the same as American workers would have received for the same jobs . Plaintiffs' lawyers contended that American workers, due to the shortage of skilled laborers, commanded much higher wages and that Signal profited greatly from the use of the Indian workers. The suits are being brought under the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act, a federal law passed in 2003 to protect people from traffickers. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is also suing Signal. That trial is slated to start on June 1 in New Orleans. Howard said it was far from clear when the Indian workers might see any compensation. He said Signal has suggested it might file for bankruptcy. A spokeswoman for the company said she could not comment on that issue but would pass it to others for their consideration.","Signal International used the federal government's H-2B guest-worker program to recruit Indians to work as welders and pipefitters .

"June ‘Mama June’ Shannon has revealed for the first time the real father of daughter Pumpkin amid accusations she was fathered by Mark McDaniel, the man who was convicted of molesting Pumpkin's sister, Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell. In a sit down multi-part interview with Entertainment Tonight, which will start Thursday night, the 35-year-old TLC reality star and mother of Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson said Pumpkin's biological father is Michael Anthony Ford, another convicted sex offender who is prison for the sexual exploitation of minors until 2026. Ford is also the father of Mama June's second eldest daughter, Jessica, 18. June claimed to have only seen McDaniel twice since he was released from prison in October after serving 10 years for aggravated child molestation of an eight-year-old in 2004, who Anna says is actually her. Scroll down for video . Revelations: June ‘Mama June’ Shannon sits down for an interview with Entertainment Tonight's Brooke Anderson following claims she has rekindled a relationship with Mark McDaniel, the man who molested eldest daughter Anna and is thought to be the father of middle daughter Lauryn, AKA Pumpkin . Truth: Mama June claims Michael Anthony Ford (left), a convicted sex offender, is the biological father of both middle daughters Jessica and Lauryn, AKA Pumpkin, and not Mark McDaniel (right), who molested her eldest daughter Anna . Family torn apart: Mama June (front left) pictured here with (clockwise from left) eldest daughter Anna 'Chickadee', 20, ex-husband Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson, and daughters Lauryn 'Pumpkin', 14, Jessica 'Chubbs', 18, and Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' June said one meeting she had with McDaniel was coincidental, and the other was to give closure to Pumpkin, who had been raised believing McDaniel was her father. 'Since two months to almost six years, (Pumpkin) knew nobody but (McDaniel),' June explained. 'She was starting to resent Anna and she was starting to ask me questions. 'I can't answer those questions for Pumpkin.' June said she lied to her family about who Pumpkin's father really was because Ford had never been around for Jessica. She said 12 other people were in the room when she took Pumpkin to see McDaniel. June, who will also be interviewed by Dr Phil, has spoken out after claims by daughter Anna that Pumpkin - real name Lauryn Thompson - believed McDaniel was her father. June has maintained her four daughters are from four different men. The claim means Ford father two of the girls, middle daughters Jessica and Lauryn 'Pumpkin'. Eldest Anna's father is David Dunn, who was sentenced for stealing a handgun in 1995 and again in 1998 for stealing cigarettes. The father of the youngest, Alana 'Honey Boo Boo', is Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson, who split from wife Mama June earlier this year. Speaking out: Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell spoke to Dr Drew recently about how her sister Pumpkin was raised to believe Mark McDaniel - who Anna says molested her as a child - is her father . Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell caused headlines last week in another interview by revealing what June has now confirmed- that Pumpkin was raised to believe McDaniel was her father. 'You know, out of all the kids we have, Mama does not know who Pumpkin's dad is. And Pumpkin thinks it's Mark which kind of hurts my feelings, because Mama is making her believe that someone who did that to me is her father,' Anna told Dr Drew on HLN recently. 'Now Pumpkin hates me for it... I don't really care. Me and Pumpkin have never been that close... Now with her cussing me out, [saying ] ""screw you"" ""F you""... I'm just done with it.' She added that McDaniel, 53, may have originally come back into Mama June's life earlier this year because he wanted to 'surprise' Pumpkin after he got out of prison. He served 10 years after pleading guilty to child molestation following Anna's claims that he had sexually assaulted her - sometimes while Pumpkin, then three, was in bed beside her. After Anna told her teacher and police about the assaults, her mother refused to believe her, she said. Support: Lauryn 'Pumpkin' Thompson (left) has stood up for her mother amid claims she is dating Mark McDaniel (right) again. Pumpkin was raised to think McDaniel was her father . Denial: Honey Boo Boo and her mother Mama June are seen outside their home last month . 'Mama didn't believe me for a while,' she told HLN. 'She would say, '""Why would you do that to me?"" And I would say, ""Mama, he did it, I can't take the past back"". 'He's apologized for what he's done but she won't... I'm hurt now and I was hurt then.' But Anna added that she is still in touch with her mother and that they are 'working on things'. Pumpkin, now 14, has repeatedly defended her mother in interviews and on social media, while Mama June herself has insisted that she hasn't seen McDaniel in 10 years. But photographs appeared to tell a different story. She has been pictured house hunting with McDaniel, while another image shows them together with Honey Boo Boo. In that image, McDaniel has his hand on the nine-year-old girl's shoulder. Together: Images, such as this one, have emerged showing Mama June with McDaniel. In this photograph, they are pictured with Mama June's daughter, nine-year-old Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson . The children's uncle, Uncle Poodle, has also claimed in an interview that he witnessed the young girl sharing a bed with McDaniel and Mama June during a trip to North Carolina in September. 'I'm disgusted with June for not protecting Alana from Mark,' Uncle Poodle - real name Lee Thompson - told the National Enquirer. 'This guy can't be trusted. He needs to be locked up and have the key thrown away.' Since the reports emerged, the family's show, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, has been canceled. Mama June's three youngest girls still live at home in MacIntyre, Georgia, while Anna - who has a two-year-old daughter, Kaitlyn - has since moved to Alabama after marrying Michael Cardwell.","June 'Mama June' Shannon says Pumpkin's father is Mark Anthony Ford, also the father of second-eldest Jessica .

"An overflow crowd spilled into the parking lot of a New York church at the funeral Mass for a Long Island high school football player who died during a game last week. A funeral procession, led by police on motorcycles and accompanied by a pipe band, brought the casket of 16-year-old Tom Cutinella to the St John the Baptist Roman Catholic Church in Wading River on Tuesday. Cutinella, a junior on the Shoreham-Wading River varsity football team, died after collapsing during a game last Wednesday. Scroll down for video . The funeral procession led by police on motorcycles, brought the casket of 16-year-old Tom Cutinella to  St John the Baptist Roman Catholic Church in Wading River on Tuesday. His football jersey arranged from flowers was on top of one car . Tragic: Tom Cutinella (pictured left and right), 16, was playing as a linebacker for Shoreham-Wading River High School against John Glenn High School when he was fatally injured during a helmet-on-helmet tackle . Hundreds watched in silence as the funeral procession made its way to the church with the teen's football jersey No. 54 in flowers on top of one car. School was canceled for the day, CBS reported, as hundreds of school friends turned out to say goodbye to their classmate. His coffin was carried into the chapel by mourners as his devastated parents and three younger siblings followed behind. Tom had been raced to Huntington Hospital on Long Island last week, where he underwent emergency surgery for a brain injury. But despite medics' best efforts, he later died. Authorities have not revealed a cause of death. He was the third teenage footballer to die in five days following the deaths of cornerback Demario Harris Jr. and linebacker Isaiah Langston. Friends and teachers have called Cutinella an inspiration to his fellow classmates. Many members of opposing teams attended a wake for Cutinella on Sunday and Monday. His father Frank Cutinella revealed last week his son's heartbreaking final words to him as he ran toward the school bus. He explained how the teenager had forgotten his No. 54 football jersey, so he had had to hurry out of their Long Island home to give it to him. 'I threw the jersey at him and he caught it and said, ""I love you Dad"". He always said ""I love you"" to his family before going to school each morning,' the father of four told Newsday. A pipe band played a solemn funeral march as hundreds lined the street to watch the procession . The teenager's coffin was carried into the church and was followed by his devastated parents and three younger siblings . Hundreds of fellow students attended the funeral after school was canceled for the day of mourning . 'But his mom was still in the house. Then he gets halfway to the bus, turns around and says, ""Tell Mom I love her."" That was the last message he gave us.' He added that his son, who was running for junior class president alongside his football teammate Jason Curran, was an honors student who 'loved to give'. 'He always said, ""Dad, you know I'm a giver"",' he said. 'And he's still giving. I'm at the hospital right now and they are harvesting every possible organ of his that they can.' Mr Cutinella collided helmet-to-helmet with a Glenn player while blocking during the third quarter of the game. Shoreham's head coach Matt Millheiser described the smash as 'a big hit.' The player, the eldest of four siblings, then stood up and tried to walk off the field after the incident, but collapsed several feet from the sideline. He was attended to by emergency medical technicians and rushed to hospital by ambulance, while both teams agreed to suspend the game.

"An iron deficiency during pregnancy increases the risk of giving birth to a child with autism - with the risk increasing for older mothers. Those who have children with autism are significantly less likely to report taking iron supplements before and during their pregnancies than the mothers of children who are developing normally, U.S. researchers found. The risk of the child being born with autism - found to be associated with an iron deficiency - was five times greater when the mother was also 35 or older at the time of the child's birth. It also increases if a mother suffers from a condition such as obesity, hypertension or diabetes. There is an association between low intake of iron during pregnancy and the risk of having a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)- with the risk increasing fivefold for mothers aged 35 or older or who suffered from obesity, hypertension or diabetes, U.S. researchers found. Iron deficiency, or anaemia as it is known, is a condition where a lack of iron in the body leads to a reduction in the number of red blood cells. Iron is used to produce red blood cells, which help store and carry oxygen in the blood. If you have fewer red blood cells than is normal, your organs and tissues will not get as much oxygen as they usually would. Researchers said that iron is crucial in the development of a foetus' brain, meaning a deficiency in this vitamin could lead to autism. The study, from researchers at the University of California, was the first to examine the relationship between maternal iron intake and having a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Previous research from the same University reported that taking supplementary folic acid was associated with a reduced risk for ASD. Rebecca Schmidt, assistant professor in the Department of Public Health Sciences, said: 'The association between lower maternal iron intake and increased ASD risk was strongest during breastfeeding, after adjustment for folic acid intake. She added: 'Further, the risk associated with low maternal iron intake was much greater when the mother was also older and had metabolic conditions during her pregnancy.' Women with 14.8mg a day for women . If you are pregnant and you are short of iron, you’ll probably get very tired and may suffer from anaemia. If the iron level in your blood becomes low, your GP or midwife will advise you to take iron supplements. Good sources of iron include: . · dark-green leafy vegetables, such as watercress and curly kale . · iron-fortified cereals or bread . · brown rice . · pulses and beans . · nuts and seeds . · meat, fish and tofu . · eggs . · dried fruit, such as dried apricots, prunes and raisins . Although liver is a good source of iron, do not eat it if you are pregnant. This is because it is also rich in vitamin A, which can damage your unborn baby in large amounts. Source: NHS Choices . The study looked at pairs of mothers and children who were enrolled in the Northern California-based Childhood Autism Risks from Genetics and the Environment (CHARGE) Study between 2002 and 2009. This included mothers of children with autism and 346 mothers of children or of typical development, who weren't considered to have ASD. The researchers examined maternal iron intake, including vitamins, other nutritional supplements, and breakfast cereals during the three months prior to the birth through the end of the women's pregnancies and breastfeeding. Professor Schmidt said: 'Iron deficiency, and its resultant anaemia, is the most common nutrient deficiency, especially during pregnancy, affecting 40 to 50 per cent of women and their infants. 'Iron is crucial to early brain development, contributing to neurotransmitter production, myelination and immune function. 'All three of these pathways have been associated with autism. 'Iron deficiency is pretty common, and even more common among women with metabolic conditions. 'However we want to be cautious and wait until this study has been replicated. 'In the meantime the takeaway message for women is do what your doctor recommends. 'Take vitamins throughout pregnancy, and take the recommended daily dosage. If there are side effects, talk to your doctor about how to address them.' For fertile women the most common causes of iron deficiency anaemia are heavy periods and the pregnancy itself, as their body needs extra iron for their baby. Dark-green leafy vegetables, such as spinach, watercress and curly kale are good sources of iron .","Mothers of children with autism were more likely to report low iron intake .

The sweet images show lovers cuddling close to each other as they sleep . He wanted to see the 'nocturnal lovers dance' and glimpse the unconscious interactions that happen in relationships. The intimate shots see couples arms flung over each other and hands clasping, while the long-exposure gives the photos a blurred and fluid look. The couples, who can volunteer to be a part of the project through Paul’s website, sleep for one night in Paul's studio apartment in a bed with black sheets and duvet. Each picture of lovers is a single long-time exposure lit only by candlelight taken over six hours. So far around 80 couples, and even some families, have taken part. Paul sets up each exposure to run between midnight and 6am. As well as couples some families have taken part in the project, such as these parents with their young baby . Some couples are entwined for most of the time while others interact far less . Every couple who volunteers sleeps for one night in a bed in Paul's studio apartment . Paul sets up each exposure to run between midnight and 6am . ‘At no point in the exposure am I in the room myself,’ Paul explains, ‘I just light the candles and set up the stage.’ One participant said of the experience: ‘I never sleep in black bed sheet and never without a top. ‘I’m not often photographed and if I am, then only with me controlling the situation. We are doing this for the art. ‘The loss of control and bareness is threatening, and feeling egotist in your sleep is threatening. ‘The camera is huge and I’m having HAL 9000 from 2001 Space Odyssey associations.'

"In my online Q&A this morning there was a lot of focus on poor performances in the Champions League but also on the current state of defending in the Premier League. One question in particular got me thinking: . Arsenal were awful in defence again against Anderlecht. But are there any good centre backs any more? I bet you can’t name 10 really good ones in the Premier League! Emma P in Watford . You’re right, Emma. I can’t! At the moment I can only really think of five defenders in the Premier League who are in good form, and even they are often dependent on their team-mates in front of them. Per Mertesacker and Arsenal endured a miserable collapse against Anderlecht in the Champions League . JOHN TERRY & GARY CAHILL . Terry is still such a reliable force for Chelsea and enjoying life again under Jose Mourinho. He has been important in the development of Cahill who I now feel is the most important player in the Chelsea back four. He has an excellent combination of mobility and physicality but he reads the game so well. They make a formidable pair and are a large part of Chelsea’s success this season. But even they can be troubled if they don’t get the proper amount of midfield protection. Crystal Palace were able to isolate them and when they did, Fraizer Campbell went past Cahill – the most consistent defender in the league – as if he wasn’t even there. That shows the importance of defending as a team. John Terry and Gary Cahill are the defensive rock holding up Jose Mourinho's Premier League leaders . JOSE FONTE & TOBY ALDERWEIRELD . Maya Yoshida started as Fonte’s primary partner but now Alderweireld, on loan from Atletico Madrid, has taken his place. Between them they have conceded just five goals in the league. Only Bayern Munich (three) and Barcelona and Juventus (both four) have conceded fewer this season. Not bad for a side who were supposed to be relegated! Under Ronald Koeman they are well drilled, they deal with crosses well and they are competent in possession. As individuals they may not stand out but with either Victor Wanyama or Morgan Schneiderlin dropping in to cover, they work well within an effective system. Southampton defender Toby Alderweireld (left) has impressed since joining the club on loan in the summer . Jose Fonte (left) has formed a formidable partnership with Alderweireld at the heart of the Saints back line . WINSTON REID . West Ham are in form and Winston Reid has been solid in their defence. James Collins and James Tomkins have been good but Reid is the most impressive member of their back line. Even then he has mostly just been getting the basics right rather than doing anything spectacular as an individual. West Ham are flying as a team, which always helps any defence, but Reid has been compact and consistent. Winston Reid is solid and not spectacular but is enjoying a fine season for West Ham . It is a defender’s responsibility to help shape and set up the team in front of him. You have to help build that barricade. If a midfielder is charging forward, you need to have words and make sure he does his job, otherwise you can be left exposed. You have to be prepared to open your mouth and ask for some help. I fell out with Lee Dixon on a few occasions at Arsenal when we disagreed about our positioning. But it was always over in a flash and we respected each other for being brave enough to speak up. I’d like to see defenders demand more from those around them. Marcos Rojo (bottom) suffered a painful end to the Manchester derby and has not shored up United's defence . Younes Kaboul (centre) is Tottenham's captain and centre back but is not shutting out the opposition . Even Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany is not playing at his best this season . If you are under pressure, you need to make sure gaps in front of you are filled and the game settles otherwise you’re in danger of letting the momentum change. That’s what happened against Anderlecht – Arsenal gave away the impetus and they were punished. Every team these days is stocked with players capable of embarrassing you, not just the top sides. It’s up to you as a defender to want to keep them out more than they want to score. Good defending is all linked to your mentality and your desire. A lot of players spend time doing weights to build up their strength, but that inner strength doesn’t come from the gym. You need an attitude of: I want to win. I want to clear every ball and win every battle. If you want it badly enough all over the pitch then you create that physical energy, which makes you look more powerful than you are. If you’ve got that hunger and drive then it becomes infectious. You just need to let your team-mates know you expect them to back you up.","Arsenal suffered embarrassing defensive collapse against Anderlecht .

"Stewart Downing was playing left back for Liverpool when he got a call from the chief executive Ian Ayre in August last year. ‘West Ham have made an offer, we’ve agreed a fee and it’s up to you,’ is football code for one thing: pack your bags. It is fair to say, after listening to Downing at England’s training centre this week, he has never really understood the reasons why Brendan Rodgers played him in defence during his first season at Anfield. Stewart Downing has been called up to the England squad by Roy Hodgson after more than two years out . Downing has always been a forward and has been in fine form for West Ham after a move from Liverpool . Downing, 30, has always been a forward and he has been in sparkling form in a number of advanced roles for Sam Allardyce’s upwardly mobile West Ham team this season. Here he is, then, back in the England squad more than two years after his last appearance for the national team, against Norway. It feels good to be back. ‘I’m honest enough to think my England career had gone,’ he admitted. ‘I hadn’t been picked for two-and-a-half years and I thought Roy would go with the younger players. But you’ve just got to keep playing well and hopefully knock on the door. I am over the moon to be here.’ Downing’s flexibility appeals to Hodgson and is something that was picked up on by England scouts when he drifted in from the right and scored a beauty with his left foot against Crystal Palace in August. Roy Hodgson gives his instructions to his stars including Wayne Rooney, Jack Wilshere and Downing . Downing is back in the England squad more than two years after his last appearance for the national team . Hodgson monitored his form and popped his head around the dressing-room door at Upton Park a few times to speak to Allardyce about some of his English players. Downing, Mark Noble, Carl Jenkinson and Andy Carroll, who returned as a substitute against Aston Villa last weekend, are all eligible to play for England. ‘He has been coming the last couple of weeks and has been in the changing room to see Sam and I’ve spoken to him a couple of times,’ added Downing. ‘I knew he was there to watch certain players in our team because the manager told me. ‘My form for West Ham has helped and the way the team has been playing has helped me get noticed by Roy. He spoke to our manager about it and the certain positions that I’ve been playing. ‘When I signed for West Ham, Sam told me that if he got the chance, he’d want me to play in the middle at times. He said I’d start as a wide man to provide for Andy Carroll but Andy got injured. Hodgson monitored Downing's form and popped his head around the dressing-room door at Upton Park . Downing, Mark Noble, Carl Jenkinson and Andy Carroll are all eligible to play for England at West Ham . ‘This season with the lads like (Diafra) Sakho and (Enner) Valencia and the pace on the counter-attack, he wanted to make it more so we could break on teams. ‘I’ve played in the three in the middle and off the front man. I’m really enjoying it.’ The variety has whetted Downing’s appetite, drawing more out of him than at any other time of a career that had taken him to Middlesbrough, Sunderland, Aston Villa, and Liverpool. He enjoys the demands of the No 10 role, the deep-lying creator for Sakho and Valencia. ‘Wingers tend to move inside as they get older — Ryan Giggs did it,’ he added. ‘The manager has seen something in my game which made him think I could play there. He wants me to get on the ball more and counter-attack.’ Downing started out on the left all those years ago when he was part of the Middlesbrough squad that won the League Cup in 2004. A decade later he has been rebuilt at West Ham, rekindling his enthusiasm for football and reminding Hodgson that he has game- changing qualities when he is in possession. Playing left back at Liverpool feels a long time ago. Downing never really understood why Brendan Rodgers played him in defence during his first year at Anfield . ‘It is not my natural position but I knew from then it was the time for me to move,’ he added. ‘I was getting signals other players were coming in. ‘I had discussions with the manager and wasn’t promised I would be in the team most weeks. I knew he was buying a lot of players, probably a lot in my position. ‘I was getting used at left back when I was a winger. ‘I think you know when the writing is on the wall for you under a manager or at a club. West Ham came at a good time for me to work for a manager who wanted me to play every week. ‘Liverpool is a great club and not many people walk out of there easily.’ He has recovered at West Ham and is now preparing for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia at Wembley on Saturday. Only a few weeks ago, new England captain Wayne Rooney was sent off at Old Trafford for a reckless challenge on Downing in a Barclays Premier League fixture. ‘I haven’t mentioned it yet, but it was just a mistimed tackle,’ added Downing. ‘He got his punishment for it.’ And after more than two years out of the England team, Downing has more than served his time, too.

"Eric Dier has asked Gareth Southgate not to pick him for England Under 21s this month because of concerns about his game. The Tottenham defender, who has been part of the squad who qualified for next summer’s European Championship, contacted the Under 21 coach before he named his 23-man party for friendlies against Portugal at Burnley and France away on Monday. Dier, 20, has been playing at right back but sees his future for club and country as a central defender and Southgate said he explained the benefits of staying with Tottenham rather than joining up with England. Gareth Southgate has revealed Eric Dier (pictured) did not want to be included in his Under 21 squad . English defender Dier joined Tottenham from Portuguese outfit Sporting Lisbon in the summer . ENGLAND (4-2-3-1): Butland; Jenkinson, Keane, Gibson, Robinson; Hughes, Carroll; Redmond, Forster-Caskey, Kane; Ings. TV: Live on BT Sport, kick-off 7.45pm. Southgate has given it his full blessing and applauded Dier for having the honesty to confront the issue. This, Southgate pointed out, is not a case of a young footballer having no ambition to represent his country. ‘This is an interesting one,’ he said. ‘We had quite a mature conversation about it. He feels there are parts of his game he wants to work at. Long term we both agree he is unlikely to be a full back. So we agreed, for this one, he stayed with Tottenham. ‘It was quite refreshing. It did take me by surprise a little bit. He would have been in the squad and we thought he did well in Croatia (in the play-offs). But I get what he is saying. England Under 21 boss Southgate revealed Dier wanted to work on his game away from the England squad . 'He recognises there are others, like Liam Moore and Ben Gibson, who are playing regularly in that position. ’This game against Portugal will be a dress-rehearsal for Euro 2015, as the two nations have been drawn in Group B, along with Italy and Sweden. England’s preparations for next summer include fixtures next March against Germany and the Czech Republic. ‘We had those games in mind six months ago,’ said Southgate. ‘The idea of going to the Czech Republic is seeing what it will be like to have a base camp and playing good opposition. The Czechs and Germany are two of the teams in the other group so it will be a good test.’","Tottenham defender Eric Dier has concerns about his performances .

"Phil Neville insists under-fire Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers is the right man to take the club forward despite their poor start to the season. The Merseysiders have failed to reach the dizzy heights of last season's impressive second placed finish, as they currently lie 18 points off the leaders Chelsea in 12th position. However, Neville is not overly surprised by the slump in Liverpool's form, believing too much was expected of their squad at the beginning of the season. Phil Neville didn't hold back when discussing Liverpool's current woes on Match of the Day . Brendan Rodgers has a heap of problems with Liverpool only winning twice in the league since August . Speaking on Match of the Day he said: 'There were unrealistic targets set for Liverpool this season, especially with Luis Suarez leaving the club. 'Without him (Suarez) last season they would have finished seventh at the end of the day. 'And now without him they are around about where they have been for the four seasons prior to last when they were second. 'Liverpool have consistently finished in the Europa League positions and when I look at their squad now that's where I think they'll finish. 'I still think he (Rodgers) is the right man for the job though and should be given more time, but understandably at the moment he is under pressure.' Mario Balotelli has still failed to find the net for Liverpool in the Premier League since joining from AC Milan . Despite stating that Rodgers needs more time to turn Liverpool's fortunes around, he does think the former Swansea manager must stop making excuses for his side's poor form. Some of the reasons the Northern Irishman has cited for their demise include the lack of experience in the Reds squad, as well as their on-going involvement in Europe, but Neville has rejected such claims. He added: 'I don't understand the excuses made about Liverpool's season being disrupted by playing in Europe. It's actually a lot easier competing in the Champions League than the Europa League. 'This is especially the case in terms of preparation and recovery, as you can be travelling a lot further away while playing in the Europa League as opposed to the Champions League. The Reds boss hinted at issues within the dressing room after another defeat in the league . 'For me there's more than enough experience in that side too. I keep hearing that this Liverpool side is a young one but the average age of the team against Crystal Palace was 26, and for a Premier League side that isn't young at all. 'A lot of these players have played in Europe as well, so should have the experience required to get themselves a win in these kind of games (against Crystal Palace).' Neville has also not been impressed with the impact Rodgers' summer signings have made at the club, with £16million man Mario Balotelli in particular being singled out for notable criticism. 'As a manager you live and die by your signings and at the moment I don't think his (Rodgers) signings have been good enough.' Fellow pundit Kevin Kilbane reinforced this view, stating that only Daniel Sturridge and maybe Philippe Coutinho, could be classed as successful signings out of all of the players Rodgers has brought to the club, with £213million spent in the process, since taking over in 2012.","Liverpool lost 3-1 at Crystal Palace on Sunday afternoon .

"There were 2,253 at the Racecourse Ground last weekend as Wrexham beat Woking to make it to round two of the FA Cup. As is often the case, the Welsh club’s most famous FA Cup face was one of them. ‘Yes, I still go there when I can,’ former Wrexham forward Mickey Thomas told Sportsmail. ‘And when I do people still ask me about the goal. ‘Of all the things that happened to me in my life and my career, that is the one that people want to talk about the most. I must get asked about it by somebody every day of my life.’ Mickey Thomas (far left) scored one of the most iconic FA Cup goals as Wrexham beat Arsenal 2-1 in 1992 . Nobody over a certain age will need reminding what ‘the goal’ is. Thomas’s left-foot free-kick against Arsenal on January 4, 1992 helped Wrexham to a famous third round win over the First Division team and was recently voted one of the BBC’s top 50 FA Cup goals. Having played in a final for Manchester United in 1979 and reached the last eight during his first spell at Wrexham the previous year, Thomas still treasures his hammer blow from the Racecourse as his favourite memory which is perhaps why he - among others - was disappointed to learn that third round weekend will have a different look about it this season. Because of the full programme of Barclays Premier League fixtures on New Year’s Day - a Thursday - talks are under way about shifting the weekend’s FA Cup games across the Sunday, Monday and perhaps even Tuesday. For the traditionalists it is yet another dispiriting development. Thomas (right) celebrates Wrexham's FA Cup third round win vs Arsenal with fellow goalscorer Steve Watkin . Hereford 2-1 Newcastle (1972) After drawing 2-2 with their top flight opponents at St James’ Park, non-league Hereford produced a massive upset when they knocked out Newcastle in extra time thanks to Ricky George’s winner. Sutton 2-1 Coventry  (1989) Coventry, then a top flight side, had won the FA Cup just 18 months prior to this match, but goals from Tony Rains and Matthew Hanlan ensured the Sky Blues were humbled by non-league Sutton at Gander Green Lane. Wrexham 2-1 Arsenal (1992) Reigning First Division champions Arsenal were fully in control of their match against Fourth Division Wrexham until a two-minute spell late on, in which goals from Mickey Thomas and Steve Watkin sent the Racecourse Ground faithful into raptures. Burnley 1-0 Liverpool (2005) Rafa Benitez paid the price for fielding a weakened XI against Championship side Burnley, as Djimi Traore’s famous spinning, backheel goal sent the Anfield side crashing out of the competition. Manchester United 0- 1 Leeds (2010) Jermaine Beckford’s chipped finish decided the latest installment of this classic rivalry with two divisions separating the sides. United’s poor performance didn’t prevent Sir Alex Ferguson complaining after referee Phil Dowd played only five minutes of injury time. ‘Sometimes I wonder if the English football authorities realise what a special thing they have in the FA Cup,’ added Thomas, 60. ‘Everywhere I go around the country or around the world people talk about the FA Cup. It’s so special to so many people. ‘Yet here we seem determined to do our best to sideline it and undermine it to the point that it looks to everybody else as if we just don’t care about it. ‘It’s just strange because most football fans I know still love the competition. ‘I certainly do. I was a fan of football before I was a player and I am a fan now. When I was growing up my dream was to play in big FA Cup ties. I was lucky enough to be able to do it and I will never forget it. I think we need to cherish the FA Cup, not mess about with it. ‘The third round is supposed to be one of the really big days on the calendar as it is when all the big boys from the top division turn up. It’s a day when all the players and fans of the smaller clubs have something to dream about. It won’t be the same though if all the games are being played at different times. I am just very disappointed.’ Over the years the FA Cup has been squeezed from several different angles. Repeat replays - such a memory of many childhoods - were lost to the expansion of the Champions League, regional semi-finals lost to the need to pay for the new Wembley, and the final’s 3pm kick-off time lost to the demands of the TV companies. Scorer of the winning goal for Wimbledon against Liverpool in the 1988 final was Lawrie Sanchez - and he believes this season’s problem could have been avoided. Lawrie Sanchez (second right) scored the winning goal in the 1988 FA Cup as Wimbledon beat Liverpool 1-0 . Sanchez, who also led Wycombe to the semi-final in 2001, said: ‘If they’d looked ahead they could have seen this coming. ‘The situation should have been seen in good time, with New Year’s Day on a Thursday. No-one will want to lose those fixtures because it’s one of the biggest days of the year for attendances. ‘But the third round could have been a weekend later, on the 10th. As it is the majority of the Premier League will see this as a chance to rest players in the FA Cup and have the excuse that they have had a tough period over Christmas and New Year. ‘I’m sure it will pan out that way. I’ll be interested to see how many Premier League players start the game on New Year’s Day and then the FA Cup game. ‘I would say no more than 15 to 20 per cent.’ Sanchez (centre) also guided Wycombe Wanderers to the FA Cup semi-finals in 2001 . With an increasing number of foreign managers and players in the English game, it is no longer safe to presume those involved will understand the unique place the FA Cup has always had in English consciousness. Too many Premier League managers now seem to approach the competition as one that gets in the way, while Newcastle actually announced last summer that progress in cup competitions was of no particular interest to them as it was perceived to have no long-term value. Perhaps then it is time, as Sanchez suggests here, to add new incentives. ‘There’s still a passion for the FA Cup,’ he added. ‘You can see it this year with attendances up, and the draws back on Mondays, where people want them to be. The BBC are helping to push it back into the conscience of the people. Newcastle boss Alan Pardew admitted last year that they don't have particular interest in cup competitions . ‘It’s the oldest competition in the world. By comparison, the Premier League is a new competition. ‘I’m not trying to say anything against the Premier League, but the FA Cup is a massive deal. It is the crown jewel and we need to keep its integrity intact. ‘A Champions League place for the winners would concentrate the minds of the Premier League clubs a little bit more and take away the sanctimonious idea that finishing fourth is a big achievement for the season. ‘Whether UEFA would allow it, I don’t know, but they’ve given a Champions League place to the winners of the Europa League so why not?’ 1991 - To avoid fixture pile-ups, FA Cup ties were limited to one replay followed by extra time and penalties. The longest ever tie was the fourth qualifying round clash between Oxford City and Alvechurch in 1971. It stretched to six matches, Alvechurch winning the fifth replay 1-0. 1991 also saw the first Wembley semi-final, Tottenham beating Arsenal 3-1. 2000 - Starting with Chelsea’s 1-0 win over Aston Villa, drawn FA Cup finals would no longer be replayed and instead settled by extra time and then penalties. 2011 - Wembley hosted the Champions League final and UEFA’s rule that no fixture could be played on the surface in the two weeks before the match meant the FA Cup final was brought forward. That meant Manchester City’s 1-0 win over Stoke clashed with the penultimate round of Premier League games. 2012 - Again, the final was played on the same day as Premier League fixtures, this time to provide a four-week break before the start of Euro 2012. To avoid clashing kick-off times, the Wembley showpiece was moved to 5.15pm, where it has remained since. 2014-15 - Those third-round ties featuring top-flight clubs will be moved from Saturday, January 3, to Sunday or Monday to allow for a full Premier League programme two days earlier on New Year’s Day.","This season's FA Cup third round ties  set to be moved from traditional slot .

"Sergio Aguero looks unstoppable at the moment but is he the best in Premier League history? Stats say he has a better goal ratio than anyone but he’s not making the top of my list of Premier League strikers. He’s not far off though... VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . 11 RUUD VAN NISTLEROOY . His intelligence was what set him apart. I had some quite famous battles with him! His runs were very clever, often standing in an offside position to get ahead of you, then the play would switch sides and you’d have to catch up with him before the cross came in to him. He was an absolute nuisance. Ruud van Nistelrooy was a nuisance at Manchester United and boasted a formidable goalscoring record . 10 MICHAEL OWEN . The double in the 2001 FA Cup final against us really hurt. He was like Roy of the Rovers, someone out of a comic who burst on to the scene and blew Argentina away. If you gave him any space behind you, he was gone and he’d score. He would have breezed past Bobby Charlton’s England record if not for injuries. He was never the same again after hamstring trouble relatively early in his career. Michael Owen finds the net against Wimbledon during a league game back in December 1999 at Anfield . 9 IAN WRIGHT . Everyone talked about the famous Arsenal back four but Wright scored the goals that won the games. He was a showman and didn’t really enjoy tap-ins. He liked to vary his finishes, you couldn’t guess where he was going to put it. I played against him too and he was determined and strong. An explosive character. Ian Wright scores for Arsenal against Liverpool during a 4-0 thumping at Highbury in April 1992 . 8 ROBBIE FOWLER . He reminds me regularly of scoring the fastest Premier League hat-trick — against me! I think he is the most natural finisher I’ve seen. Scoring seemed so effortless, he’d just guide the ball into the corner - he didn’t need to leather the ball. Injuries stopped him from maintaining the same absurd levels he set early in his career. Robbie Fowler scores against Newcastle United during Liverpool's 4-3 win back in the 1996-97 season . 7 WAYNE ROONEY . He could yet move up this list depending on the next few years. His breakthrough was phenomenal. I like his determination and the fact he can score any type of goal. He could play in almost any position but I still like him sitting deeper. His record and trophy cabinet say it all. Wayne Rooney scored this wonder goal against Manchester City at Old Trafford in February 2011 . Rooney's breakthrough when at Everton and then at Manchester United was phenomenal . 6 DENNIS BERGKAMP . The maestro. People didn’t realise how fast he was because he often played so deep. You couldn’t catch him. He had such vision, balance, intelligence and skill. His right foot was like a hook. Henry learned so much from him. He was a perfectionist too, always looking for the perfect pass. Everything he hit was so clean. The Dutchman brought a poise to the Gunners which typified the style in which Wenger wanted to play . Dennis Bergkamp - scorer of this memorable effort against Leicester in 1997 - is No 6 on Keown's list . Keown takes on England rugby star Kyle Eastmond in his predictions challenge - could you do any better? 5 DIDIER DROGBA . I’d have loved to have played against him. As a lone striker, he was as good as there has been. He could occupy both centre-halves with his movement. At a peak, he played on the shoulder and was so powerful. He was so much better than the rest that he still has a role now under Jose Mourinho. He bullied defenders. Didier Drogba (pictured playing against Manchester United) is now back at Jose Mourinho's Chelsea . 4 ALAN SHEARER . My Match of the Day colleague didn’t score too many goals against me! But he was prolific - lethal in front of goal. He hit the ball harder than anyone else and had supreme confidence in his striking ability. He wasn’t big but had an excellent spring and used his body well to score so many headers. You had to be so tight to him or he’d bury the ball. Former Newcastle striker Alan Shearer has scored more goals than anybody else in the Premier League . Shearer netted for Newcastle, Blackburn Rovers and Southampton - always celebrating the same way . 3 SERGIO AGUERO . If he doesn’t get away from someone first time, he’ll just stop and then try again with a little swivel and drop of the shoulder. Then it’s in the back of the net. Everything’s very controlled and he’s one of the few who doesn’t seem to have a nasty side. And when Manchester City most needed him - on the final day a few seasons ago - he rose to the occasion. Sergio Aguero is the man in form at the moment but only makes it to No 3 in Martin Keown's top 11 . 2 LUIS SUAREZ . He was like a little rat, who wriggled free of people to score goals. His opportunism and ability to score glorious goals in a good but not brilliant Liverpool team was exceptional. He played on the edge and took things far too far sometimes. But he also gave us some incredible moments. Despite his faults, Luis Suarez gave the top flight some incredible moments during his time at Liverpool . Suarez celebrates after scoring away at Crystal Palace towards the back end of last season . 1 THIERRY HENRY . The package of pace, power, skill, intelligence and trophies makes him my No 1. He was a dramatic, driving force when he was in the zone. He was unstoppable once he realised he could win games single-handedly. When he scored his first goal - at Southampton - I said to him that I would be able to tell my grandchildren that I had played with him. And I rarely congratulated people! He looked at me astonished. Thierry Henry's pace, power, skill and the trophies make him the No 1 Premier League striker of all-time . Henry celebrates his first Arsenal goal away at Southampton in September 1999 with Marc Overmars . Special mentions need to go to a few others, who narrowly miss out. Les Ferdinand was my toughest opponent, Nicolas Anelka could have been the new Henry, Andy Cole is often underestimated, Robin van Persie has been blighted by injury and Teddy Sheringham’s longevity was incredible.","Sportsmail columnist Martin Keown rates Sergio Aguero against the greatest Premier League strikers of all time .

However, after he failed to hit the target in the next two games, against Costa Rica and Uruguay, midfielder Daniele De Rossi said: 'We need real men, not Panini stickers or characters. These are of no use to the national team.' Goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon added: 'On the pitch, you see who people really are or are not.' However, Chiellini said on Wednesday that it was all water under the bridge. 'There is nothing to mend,' he said. 'The coach has made his choice and there is nothing to add. 'Things went badly in Brazil but we have put a lid on that. Balotelli tussles with Empoli defender Daniele Rugani (right) at Coverciano in Florence .

'I understand that it is important for the media to know how many times Mario goes to the bathroom, how often he sneezes and how many times he has called his mother. 'But Balotelli is as good as De Rossi, Buffon and the newcomers. What is important is that on Sunday we will be at one,' added Chiellini, before asking that reporters change the subject. Italy said that midfielder Marco Verratti had been ruled out of Sunday's Euro 2016 qualifier at home to Croatia because of a thigh muscle problem. 'Marco Verratti will return to France to continue the necessary treatment to recover from an insertional tendinopathy of his left adductor that prevented him from training on Monday,' said the Italian federation in a statement.

"Murder-suicide dad Josh Powell had a secret fetish, according to documents released today under state public record laws. Powell, who blew up himself and his two sons Charlie and Braden after being accused of murdering his wife, told Washington social workers he liked to take pictures of strangers' legs in public places. The files say Powell seemed to understand the laws around taking voyeur pictures and said he didn't take pictures of people's faces. Fetish: Josh Powell told social workers he liked taking photos of stranger's legs. Up until his death he maintained that he had nothing to do with wife Susan's disappearance . His admission came one day after his father, Stephen Powell, was arrested on voyeurism and child pornography charges. Police believed the elder Powell may know what happened regarding Susan’s disappearance and searched his home looking for evidence in Susan's disappearance. They found child pornography and other troubling videos in Steve Powell's bedroom. Prosecutors said that for at least a decade, he had been secretly filming women, including Susan, and that he shot footage of two young female neighbours as they took baths and sat on the toilet. He remains jailed on $200,000 bail. Arrested: Steven Powell was arrested on voyeurism charges, the day before Josh Powell's revelation about enjoying taking photos of stranger's legs . Vanished: Susan Powell disappeared in 2009. Husband Josh Powell was a suspect . Josh Powell was a suspect in the disappearance of Susan Powell from their West Valley City, Utah, home in 2009 but he maintained that he did not know what had happened to her. He claimed he took his young sons, then four and two, camping on the freezing winter night around 12.30am, and said he believed his wife ran off with another man. Weeks later, he moved the boys to the home of his fathe  in Puyallup, Washington. After Steven Powell's arrest, the boys were removed from the house and turned over to Susan Powell's parents. Explosion: Josh Powell blew up his house, killing himself and his two sons . Authorities searched the desert for twelve days in the area where Josh Powell said he went camping that night. At one point, they said they found a . 'shallow grave' after cadaver dogs alerted them to the spot. But they . found no human remains. In February Powell killed himself and his two sons, Charles and Braden, in a house fire. A social worker had taken them to his rental home on February 5 for what was supposed to be a court-sanctioned supervised visit. Devastated: Chuck and Judy Cox spoke out after their two grandsons, Charlie and Braden, were killed . Powell let the boys inside, locked the social worker out, hit them with a hatchet and set fire to gasoline, authorities said. In the wake of the gas explosion, . Susan’s parents - Chuck and Judy Cox - spoke out about the revelations . that their grandchildren had made in the months leading up to the . explosion. 'Over the Christmas holidays, Chuck (Cox) sent me an email saying something like ""Real important- one of the boys says if we go to the mine we will find mommy,""' Ann Bremner, one of the Cox's lawyers who was focusing on the disappearance of Susan, told MailOnline exclusively. Ms Bremner said that Mr Cox immediately told police about the boy's admission, but nothing was done.","Was a suspect in disappearance of wife Susan .

"Roberto Mancini believes Mario Balotelli's stint at Liverpool is 'his last chance' to prove himself at a big club - and the striker knows it. The Italian striker has struggled to make an impact at Anfield since his £16million move from AC Milan in the summer, scoring just one goal in a red shirt so far. Mancini, who worked with the volatile striker at Inter Milan and Manchester City, is hoping Balotelli can start taking his chances in the Premier League. Mario Balotelli shows off his personalised snood with his number and the face of 'Super Mario' Balotelli scores his only goal in a Liverpool shirt so far - against Ludogorets in the Champions League . Mancini said: 'Mario is a good guy, but he is aware that Liverpool is probably his final opportunity to prove what he can do on the pitch. It's his last chance. The fiery pair were famously pictured grappling during a training ground bust-up in 2013, but Mancini revealed that he is still in contact with Balotelli, who knows he 'must score more goals' at Liverpool. 'I often talk to him via text message, but only he can help himself now. 'He told me that he wants to and must score more goals for Liverpool.' Balotelli was more serene on the training ground with Liverpool reserves on Thursday and showed off his new, personalised snood.

"A Target employee committed suicide just days after he was accused of stealing at the store. Graham Gentles, a 22-year-old from Pasadena, California who suffers from Asperger's Syndrome, was 'paraded, around the store in handcuffs as a punishment for stealing, even though police and store management never found anything and he was never charged. Three days after the incident, on July 18 of last year, he jumped to his death from the roof of the Courtyard Marriott in Monrovia. Scroll down for video . Graham Gentles (above) jumped off a building just days after he was accused of stealing at the Target where he is employed . Gentiles, who has recently enlisted, suffered from Asperger's Syndrome . Gentiles was put in handcuffs and forced to do the 'walk of shame' at Target after it was believed he had stolen . Now, Graham's mother, Virginia, is taking legal action against the company, not just for the death of her son, but to make sure this 'walk of shame' practice is ended in all of their stores. 'He said, ""Mom, I've never stolen,""' Virginia  recalled of that day in an interview with ABC 7. 'He said, ""They did the walk of shame, I had to do the walk of shame. But they only do that when people steal and I've never stolen a thing.""' She also told NBC 4; 'The only thing he said to me at that moment was, ""Mom this is the worst day of my life.""' Her attorney, Patrick McNicholas, added; 'This was part of his extended family. He had indicated that he felt safe there. This is where his friends were, so he felt as though he lost all of that in one moment.' Target has refused to comment due to the pending litigation. Mother Virginia (above with Graham) believes this was all the result of an argument that occurred between her son, who had recently enlisted, and a coworker at a bar during non-work hours . His mother Virginia claims the suicide was a result of the 'severe distress' he felt after being paraded around the store for stealing . He jumped to his death from the roof of the Courtyard Marriott in Monrovia (above) Virginia believes this was all the result of an argument that occurred between her son, who had recently enlisted, and a coworker at a bar during non-work hours. She believes the individual who fought with Graham had reported that he had stolen, which is why when he went to leave that day he was met by police and management. According to the suit, 'police forcefully grabbed him, emptied his pockets and pulled his hat off.' Then, 'he was handcuffed and led to an office,' at the direction of a store manager. 'Gentles was shocked, confused and mortified at being handcuffed and walked through the Target store in front of co-workers and store customers. Mr. Gentles had no idea why he was being arrested,' says the complaint. According to the suit, this resulted in 'severe emotional distress,' something that was made even worse by his Asperger's condition claims his mother, and ultimately his suicide. 'One of the primary purposes of this lawsuit is that Target stops the policy immediately [and] recognizes the harm that it could do,' said McNicholas. 'I don't want any other mother to have to go through what I've gone through,' said Virginia. 'This is my only child.'

"A women’s university rowing club has been banned from Facebook after their nude charity calendar was branded as pornography. Students from the University of Warwick Rowing Society dressed down for the shoot, which sold 1,500 copies, and raised thousands of pounds for Macmillan Cancer Support. The 17 members of the group posed naked next to the River Avon and their boat house in Barford, Warwickshire, before posting the pictures on both Facebook and Twitter. Scroll down for video . One of the pictures taken as part of the women's University of Warwick Rowing Society's charity calendar . Facebook has completely removed the page after stating that the page's content breached its 'terms of use' The group’s aim was to drum up more support from fans around the world and top their £3,400 total raised for the charity. But the girls have been left devastated after Facebook removed their page ‘Warwick Rowing’s Women’s Naked Calendar’ for its ‘explicitly sexual content’. The rowers were told they were breaching the social media sites’ ‘nudity and pornography’ policy. Organiser Sophie Bell, 20, has blasted Facebook’s decision for harming their chances of raising more money for charity with their 2015 calendar, due to be released later this year. The history and politics student, who has just finished her second year, said: ‘Facebook can unpublish pages after it gives you a warning to make amendments. ‘That happened to us a couple of times over the last year where they would ask us to remove certain pictures randomly because they breached their nudity and porn regulations.

Miss Bell believes Facebook's decision is 'borderline sexism' as the male group is allowed to keep its page . The group has already shot its 2015 calendar, which is due to be released in October this year . The rowers have sent countless emails to Facebook in a bid to try and get their page back up and running . ‘We always made the amendments and took the pictures down - even though they were no racier than the others - but a few days ago they emailed and said the page was being completely removed. ‘They say it is because of nudity but we are not violating any of their terms and all the pictures we post are not indecent images or inappropriate. ‘It is awful for us because we had over 2,000 likes which provides us with a large platform for reaching out to our target market. ‘We are students so we don’t have a marketing budget so we do use social media as the main way of marketing it. ‘To have this page unfairly taken away is . going to affect our sales for the 2015 calendar and decrease the amount . we can make for charity. ‘There are loads of similar nude charity . calendars who have Facebook pages plastered across the site - why aren’t . they being asked to takes theirs down too.’ Hettie Reed, 22, who also organised the calendar, said the photos are 'tasteful' and not 'pornographic' In an email sent to the rowers, Facebook told them their site had been removed for ‘violating’ its terms of use. It said: ‘Continued misuse of Facebook’s features could result in the permanent loss of your account.’ The group has sent countless emails to . the US site in order to try and explain their situation but have yet to . receive a response. But Sophie, who is originally from Upminster, Essex, added: ‘It is a charity calendar - how can it be porn? ‘The Facebook account for the male . rower’s charity calendar hasn’t been deleted and their page is the same . as ours. It is borderline sexism. The 17 members of the group posed naked next to the River Avon and their boat house in Warwickshire .

We’ve tried to get in contact with Facebook and sent emails . but have got no response.’ Hettie Reed, 22, who has just graduated from Warwick and also organised the calendar, said: ‘The photos we posted are all tasteful and couldn’t be considered obscene or pornographic. The social media site is known for removing posts that users find unacceptable, here are just a few: . The 'Warwick Rowing's Men's Naked Calendar' Facebook page has been allowed to stay despite the removal of the women's page . ‘They cited that it is due to the nudity and explicit images - we couldn’t believe it. ‘All of the girls are strategically covered up and our calendar has been praised for its artistic and tasteful nature. ‘The photos are no different from the holiday snaps of men and women that appear on everyone’s Facebook feeds. ‘It is definitely going to hamper the success of the girls’ future charity efforts which is disappointing.’ The sites community standards section also states: ‘We impose limitations on the display of nudity. ‘We . aspire to respect people’s right to share content of personal . importance, whether those are photos of a sculpture like Michelangelo’s . David or family photos of a child breastfeeding.’ The . rowers raised £600 for Macmillan Cancer Support with their first . calendar in 2013 which caused controversy when it was branded as ‘tacky’ for portraying women as ‘sex objects’.

"Two young women who had been best friends since the age of four tragically lost their lives together this week when they were killed in a horror car crash. Jani von Wielligh, from Adelaide in South Australia, and Natasha Strydom, from Waiuku in Auckland, were road-tripping across New Zealand when an oncoming car drifted across the centre line and into their vehicle. The women, both 20, were driving along the State Highway 25 near Thames in Waitakaruru and Kopu, about 100 kilometres south-east of Auckland. Fanie Strydom, Natasha's father told the NZ Herald the women had stopped into the Strydom family home in Waiuku on Tuesday before the crash. Scroll down for video . Jani von Wielligh, from Adelaide in South Australia, (left) and Natasha Strydom, from Waiuku in Auckland, (right) were killed in a horror car crash on Tuesday . It is thought another car crossed the centre line on the highway and smashed into their vehicle . Jani and Natasha had been friends since they attended kindergarten in South Africa together as children, and stayed in touch when their families emigrated to Adelaide and Waiuku respectively. 'They kept in touch all the way through and visited back and forward,' Mr Strydom told the NZ Herald. 'They were both the most amazing and loving girls. They were such an example of a good, perfect friendship.' The best friends were headed to Palmerston North to visit Natasha's university and check out where she was living. The best friends had been road-tripping across New Zealand and had stopped in at Natasha's family home just hours before the accident . The women, both 20, were driving along the State Highway 25 near Thames in Waitakaruru and Kopu, about 100 kilometres south-east of Auckland . Jani's father Erich von Wielligh also spoke of the strong relationship the two women shared. 'They were friends from kindergarten and we moved to Australia, and the Strydom family moved to New Zealand, but we kept contact and the girls were always visiting each other on holidays.' On Wednesday Natasha's mother shared a touching tribute to her young daughter alongside a family picture which shows the whole family beaming. 'Thank you God for the best twenty years of my life!, Charmaine Strydom wrote. Tributes also flowed from friends and family of the girls, with one woman writing on Mrs Strydom's page: '...my heart is broken for you and the parents of this other precious girl - these two precious jewels are now in another heaven.' Tributes have poured in for the young women, who had been the best of friends since they were four . The driver of the other car was taken to hospital where she remains in a critical but stable condition . 'Two beautiful young girls - gone to heaven. We are grieving with you and remembering all the wonderful years you've had together,' another friend posted. The driver of the other car involved in the fatal accident was taken to hospital in a critical condition, but has since stabilised. Waikato District Road Policing Manager Inspector Dana McDonald said the Serious Crash Unit was still investigating the crash to find out the exact nature of it. 'Initial indications are the west-bound Volkswagen car appears to have crossed the centre line and collided with the Mazda in the east-bound lane,' she said, according to Stuff.co.nz. Speed and alcohol have been ruled out as factors in the crash, Ms McDonald also revealed.","Jani von Wielligh, from Adelaide in South Australia, and Natasha Strydom, from Waiuku in Auckland, were killed in a horror car crash on Tuesday .

"NASA is planning for a robotic spaceship to lasso a small asteroid and park it near the moon for astronauts to explore, a top senator revealed Friday. The robotic ship would capture the 500-ton 25-foot asteroid in 2019. Then using an Orion space capsule, now being developed, a crew of about four astronauts would nuzzle up next to the rock in 2021 for spacewalking exploration, according to a government document obtained by The Associated Press. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., said the plan would speed up by four years the existing mission to land astronauts on an asteroid by bringing the space rock closer to Earth. Exploration: Using an Orion space capsule, pictured, a crew of about four astronauts would nuzzle up next to the rock in 2021 for spacewalking exploration . Nelson, who is chairman of the Senate science and space subcommittee, said on Friday that President Barack Obama is putting $100 million in planning money for the accelerated asteroid mission in the 2014 budget that comes out next week. The Democratic Senator is also a former astronaut, he spent six days orbiting the earth in 1986 aboard the shuttle Columbia. The money would be used to find the right small asteroid. 'It really is a clever concept,' Nelson said in a press conference in Orlando. 'Go find your ideal candidate for an asteroid. Go get it robotically and bring it back. 'While there are thousands of . asteroids that size out there, finding the right one that comes by Earth . at just the right time to be captured will not be easy, said Donald . Yeomans, who heads NASA's Near Earth Object program that monitors . close-by asteroids. He said once a suitable rock is found . it would be captured with the space equivalent of 'a baggie with a . drawstring. You bag it. You attach the solar propulsion module to . de-spin it and bring it back to where you want it.' How to catch an asteroid: This graphic shows how . the projected asteroid-catching spacecraft might look. The 18-ton probe . would catch a 500-ton space rock in a giant, draw-string bag . Yeomans said a 25-foot asteroid is no threat to Earth because it would burn up should it inadvertently enter Earth's atmosphere. The mission as Nelson described is perfectly safe, he said. Nelson said this would help NASA develop the capability to nudge away a dangerous asteroid if one headed to Earth in the future. It also would be training for a future mission to send astronauts to Mars in the 2030s, he said. The government document said the mission, with no price tag at the moment, would inspire because it 'will send humans farther than they have ever been before.' The mission was first suggested last year by space experts at the California Institute of Technology. Projected to cost $2.65billion in . total and last ten years, the project has found favor with the Obama administration, which has already announced a goal of sending . astronauts to a near-Earth asteroid by 2025. Researchers from CalTech's Keck Institute for Space Studies (KISS) detailed the plan in a paper published last spring. 'The idea of exploiting the natural resources of asteroids dates back over a hundred years, but only now has the technology become available to make this idea a reality,' the report says. The KISS feasibility study suggests that bringing a 500-ton asteroid closer to Earth would give astronaut crews a 'unique, meaningful and affordable' destination for the next decade. Schematic: Researchers from CalTech's Keck . Institute for Space Studies (KISS) detailed the plan in a paper . published last spring, but Nasa is now reportedly seeking funding to . execute it . It adds: 'Placing an NEA [Near Earth . Asteroid] in lunar orbit would provide a new capability for human . exploration not seen since Apollo. Such an achievement has the potential . to inspire a nation. 'It would be mankind’s first attempt at modifying the heavens to enable the permanent settlement of humans in space.' The report outlines an entirely robotic mission to locate and capture a Near Earth Asteroid (NEA), with a diameter of about seven meters and a mass of around 500,000kg. It is hoped such a modestly sized space rock may contain up to 100 tons of water, 100 tons of carbon rich compounds, 90 tons of metals and 200 tons of silicates. An 18-ton probe would be launched on an Atlas V rocket and use the Moon's gravity to slingshot itself towards its target in interplanetary space. Once there, the spacecraft would deploy a massive inflatable bag to envelop the asteroid - maneuvering to stabilize against any tumble or rotation - then 'multiple ""draw strings"" would cinch-close the opening of the bag and also cinch-tight against the bulk material,' the report says. The proposed timeline for capturing the . asteroid: Projected to cost $2.65 billion in total and last ten years, . the project is said to have found favor with the Obama administration . It adds: 'Due to the residual velocity between the asteroid and the spacecraft, there would be some “impact” as the asteroid is captured. 'Although, since the asteroid would be much more massive than the spacecraft, it is perhaps better to think of this as the asteroid capturing the spacecraft. An ion thruster is a form of electric propulsion used for spacecraft that creates thrust by accelerating ions. Ion thrusters use beams of ions . (electrically charged atoms or molecules) to create thrust in accordance . with momentum conservation. They create very small levels of . thrust compared to conventional chemical rockets but achieve very high . specific impulse, or propellant mass efficiencies, by accelerating their . exhausts to very high speed. However, ion thrusters carry a . fundamental price: the power imparted to the exhaust increases with the . square of its velocity while the thrust increases only linearly. Normal chemical rockets, on the . other hand, can provide very high thrust but are limited in total . impulse by the small amount of energy that can be stored chemically in . the propellants. Due to their relatively high power . needs and the requirement of an environment void of other ionized . particles ion thrust propulsion is currently only practical in space. 'Nevertheless, once the spacecraft and . asteroid are tightly secured together, the spacecraft could then . de-tumble the combination.' Moving such a huge object using conventional rockets would need an enormous amount of fuel to be carried along with the probe. So rather than using chemical rockets it would be equipped with a solar powered electric propulsion system. Such . 'ion thrusters', as they are known, work by using electricity generated . by solar panels to accelerate charged particles away from the space . craft, ars technica explains. Using these, the spacecraft could begin its long track back to the Moon, estimated to take between two and six years. The . announcement of the $100 million in funding for the project comes three . months after Major-General James Bolden made a cryptic suggestion to a . National Research Council committee on human space flight. 'When . the President announced that an asteroid would be the next destination . for NASA's human spaceflight program, he did not say NASA had to fly all . the way to an asteroid,' he said. 'What matters is the ability to put humans on an asteroid.'","Would help NASA develop the capability to nudge away a dangerous asteroid if one headed to Earth .

"It is the perfect invention for anyone who needs a gentle reminder to get off the sofa. Google has invented a talking shoe that can sense activity – and inactivity – and tells the wearer when they need to get moving. Fitted with a host of gadgets that measure movement, direction and balance, the built-in microprocessor connects to an audio speaker in the tongue of the Adidas trainer. Scroll down for video . Stop motion: The sneakers are designed to detect when its wearer is moving or not moving, and may let you know that it doesn't like being inactive . Commentary: The shoe may be programmed to offer encouragement or trash talk . The gadgets are programmed to . translate the pressure sensor and accelerometer readings into simple . audio instructions for the wearer. But not content simply to give someone . feedback, the inventors at Google have given the shoes their own . personality – that of a sarcastic, impatient personal trainer who cheers . and sneers in equal measure. When the wearer, for example, is . stationary for too long, the trainers will say, ‘This is super boring’, . or ‘Let’s do this’. When someone ups their activity, the shoes will pipe . up with, ‘That’s more like it’, and ‘I love the feel of the wind in my . laces’. And increasing to a sprint will prompt the speakers to call out: . ‘Call 911, you are on fire’, or the ultimate in praise: ‘You have made . me a very proud shoe.’ Where am I? The shoe utilizes Bluetooth technology to connect itself to the internet, and can provide location and directions using Google's mapping app . Cheerleaders: The shoes can also utilize social networking sites, allowing a wearer's friends to comment and 'like' the performance . He got game: The footwear could do all the trash talking for you during a high-intensity game on the court .

"Whether hunching shoulders come from years of sitting at a desk or - let's face it - laziness, few of us are strangers to bad posture. Now a Parisian fashion firm hopes to turn that all around by bringing out a techy T-shirt which promises to help us stand tall again. Clever elastic film bands sewn into the upper section of the top apply gentle pressure to 'remind' wearers that they need to stand with their shoulders back. Scroll down for video . UpCouture's techy t-shirt promises to help us stand up straight again with the use of clever elastic film pieces sewn into the tops . Interestingly, the special film pieces are not tailored to follow the natural curves of the shoulders, and it took an 30 prototypes to reach the ideal Up T-Shirt pattern. Paris-based firm UpCouture have created the Up T-shirt, which 'encourages the holding of the shoulders in a beautiful position, which results in a higher and more appealing profile'. But beautiful posture won't come cheap. While it comes in different styles and designs for both men and women, one very basic Up T-Shirt comes in at £105 ($172). The tops are designed to not only make wearers look more presentable but spare them from back problems through use of the innovative and patented set of elastic bands. They are integrated into the t-shirt in a way that 'allows it to be comfortable and flexible'. Apparently the T-shirt is ‘most efficient when it is fitted' - so if you're undecided, go for a smaller size. This picture and diagram shows the inner workings and technology within the top . The top comes in at £105 for a basic style . Four years ago in January 2010 designers saw a gap in the market for a fashion-forward, comfortable posture-perfecting T-shirt. One of their first challenges was to create the correct balance of elastic forces. They looked to the anatomy for guidance and embarked on months of research and development. Designers finally decided upon an extra-thin film . with the perfect stress/strain ratio and 100 per cent recovery . power. The material is both sown and bonded to the garment. After designing a top featuring the ideal mix of forces for maximum efficiency and comfort, UpCouture patented their design and set up shop. They now deliver to most of Europe, North America and rest of world. Fancier necklines and coloured, printed designs will set buyers back slightly more .

"Oiled up and dancing naked on stage in front of hordes of screaming women, it is clear that male stripper troupe Dreamboys have no shortage of female attention. But with randy women throwing themselves at the boys at every turn, what is it like for the long-suffering girls who actually date these honed, human Ken dolls? According to one such woman, who lives with Dreamboy fiancé Tom 'Tommy Love', 25, in Essex, it's an exercise in self-esteem. Rowan and Tommy hold up Tommy's fiancée . You can't be an insecure and jealous person, because the job would drive you nuts,' she says. 'It's funny, a lot of the girlfriends or girls the boys start seeing are girls who they meet at the show. But the minute they're with them they want them to quit the job. 'A lot of the boys have had girlfriends in the past, but it takes a certain girl to understand and look at the bigger picture. I'd say think about it first before you get with a Dreamboy.' 'You have to be down to earth too,' she says. 'The boys aren't interested in anything fake. 'If you have a chance to speak to one of them, just be yourself and down to earth and they'll like that better than anything. The attractive blonde, 27, who wishes not to be named for professional reasons, has been with her stripper lover for more than two years and couldn't be happier - even if he spends his weekends gyrating in front of screaming fans and often comes home to saucy messages. 'We met in November 2012 at an exhibition in London where Tommy and the boys were showcasing their tour and I was doing promotional work. Tommy's fiancée says the perks of the job involve that he's always in incredible shape . 'I was working with my sister and we didn't have the time to watch the show - they were dancing every hour on the dot. But on the last day we were walking down one of the stairs and bumped into them. 'Tommy started speaking to me straight away and invited us to watch the very last show. 'I thought it was good even though as it was during the daytime it was pretty PG. Tommy looked the best to me.' 'He invited me out for dinner and I wasn't going to go at first. They're stereotyped as arrogant and full of themselves. You'd expect that.' Tommy, however, was more nervous than his future fiancée realised, thinking she was way out of his league. 'To be honest, when I first saw her I . thought she was too good for me. I was with [fellow Dreamboy] Rowan and . when we were doing the promo stuff. I said ""Look how gorgeous she is"",' he says. Luckily, the two did end up going on the date, and Tommy turned out to be 'very different' to how she'd expected. The PG performance was impressive - but it gets much raunchier for the real show . Since hooking up with a Dreamboy, Tommy's fiancée has taken her girlfriends to the shows. 'I'd be worried if people didn't think my boyfriend was fit,' she says. 'I'm not insecure at all and I'm not a jealous person, but obviously he gets a lot of female attention and people sometimes try to contact him after the shows on Facebook. 'The boys are all so used to it they handle it really well. There's a strict line between entertaining and crossing the line, and the ones with girlfriends are pretty good at realising that. 'Tommy responds to general fan mail - I don't think it's nice for guys to ignore friendly fan mail - but some girls send awful messages that cross the line; private messages trying to take things further. She says it's clear from Facebook that he is in a relationship, and it's inappropriate when girls try to 'offer photos in exchange for photos back'. 'It's too flirty and it's not nice to see - but I'm not worried,' she says. Tommy says despite stage personas behind the scenes they're all different in different ways . Apart from other women fancying her man, Tommy being in the Dreamboys does provide its perks. 'It keeps him in shape,' she says. 'Being part of the Dreamboys means he's always working out, and he does get a good salary.' However, the promotional model says she works for herself and says she doesn't rely on his money. The couple got engaged a year after meeting in November 2013 when Tommy took his girlfriend to Paris for her birthday weekend. Breakfast: At 7am I have 3 boiled eggs and a small portion of smoked salmon with a green . tea. Mid-morning: After I've trained at 10am I'll make a protein shake and eata . hand full of mixed nuts. Lunch: At 1pm I'll have wholemeal rice with vegetables . and tuna. Dinner: Around 5ish I will have sweet potatoes with vegetables and chicken, or . steak. Supper: Just before bed at 10ish I will have either a shake or two . spoonfuls of peanut butter. Snacks: If I have been good all day I may chuck in a cheeky chocolate bar somewhere. 'He proposed to me by the Notre Dame and then took me to dinner at the Eiffel Tower. He's really romantic. 'We haven't set a date. We're having a big engagement party to celebrate first.' Tommy, meanwhile, reveals there are two kinds of guys in the business - those who pull a lot of girls and the homebodies. 'I know I get a lot of attention but, for me, I see it as a job and good money. It keeps me fit as I've got to maintain my shape,' says Tommy. 'Once I finish a show I come home as soon as possible to our little pet dog.' 'You can think you're something special and pull a lot of girls or you can see it as a income and then go home to your loved ones. Tommy, originally from Norwich, used . to work as a builder and joined The Dreamboys after he was . approached in the gym when he was training. He went along to rehearsals, immediately got picked up and started a three-month show with the guys in Germany. He . has been with The Dreamboys for three years and keeps his physique . with a tough schedule of training five times a week and a strict diet . six days a week. Dave says keeping in shape is really important . What is it like to be single and part of the Dreamboys? It's . great, we have loads of fun on stage and . it's really convenient for my lifestyle. We also get paid well to work, . if you can call it that. I'm doing something I enjoy and getting female . attention for a couple of hours a week isn't bad either! Being . a single Dreamboy is also great. During the week I don't have time for girls as I . am so busy with my businesses (The Body MASS, a non-profit organisation specialising in University fitness, and the Mr University competition for the most in-shape students in the UK). They can often involve a lot of . travelling and also training. At the weekend, it's great to get some . female attention - it keeps me sane. Are you looking for love? I'm . not actively looking for a girlfriend at the moment, I just don't have . time as I'm focusing on my businesses. Saying that if the right girl . came along I wouldn't say no! I'm . really into fitness and healthy lifestyle so she would have to be too - . sometimes girls don't understand the diet I have to stick to. I like . girls who have a similar mindset, are really driven, and know what they . want in life. I find girls who have lots to say for themselves really . attractive too.

"She has slept with 10,091 men, binged on cocaine and blew tens of thousands of dollars on a new car and clothes. Now Gwyneth Montenegro has lifted the lid on the world of escorts - revealing her seedy lifestyle despite being raised by devout Christians. At the height of her career, Ms Montenegro was paid $500 to $1000 an hour as a elite escort. Scroll down for video . Gwyneth Montenegro has slept with more than 10,000 men and has written a book about her time as an escort . Ms Montenegro worked all over Australia, flying to exotic destinations as part of her life as an escort . Her life had become a whirlwind of drug- and alcohol-induced sexual encounters and orgies. Ms Montenegro worked all over Australia and was flown to exotic destinations to do her job. But despite the good times she had as an escort, the 36-year-old said if she could have her time over again, she would not have gone down that path. In her recently released book - appropriately titled 10,000 Men and Counting - Ms Montenegro writes very frankly about how she was gang-raped at 18, started dancing on table tops at 19 and how she became a 'high-end' escort by 21. But the now-business entrepreneur didn't start her life out as a wild child. The Melbourne woman was born into a family with deep Christian values and wanted to 'save herself' until the right man came along. She started in the sex industry when she was 21 years old after she was a table top dancer for three years . But after she was gang-raped during a night-out at a club, coupled with her low self-esteem and her lust for money, she started off table top dancing before heading into sex work. 'I saw an ad for table top dancing back when I was about 19,' Ms Montenegro said. 'I was very naïve - it’s like I fell off the bus. 'I got pretty drunk and I made $1000 cash on the first night. 'I thought that was amazing and I thought ""I must be quite decent at it"".' To cover up she was an escort, the now 36-year-old told her parents she was modelling . Later in her career Ms Montenegro 'worked up the ladder' expanding her services to all over Australia . The positive attention she was getting from clients was a far cry from her days of being bullied in high school. 'It actually gave me the confidence I never had,' she said. 'For the first time, I connected with people, with the other girls, and it made me flourish. 'It was like a family. That’s the good side of it.' But after three years, Ms Montenegro took the leap into the world of escorting - working mostly in Melbourne. Later in her career, as she 'worked up the ladder', she expanded her services to all over Australia and other parts of the world where escorting was legal. Gwyneth Montenegro - a pseudonym she created to pen her book - said she went by many names while she worked in the industry. The thousands and thousands Ms Montenegro earned as an escort was spent on a new car and luxury clothing . But the face on her book was her real face. 'All the photos of me is like me ""coming out"",' she said. 'I didn't want to go by my real name because obviously I wanted to protect my elderly mother, who is 77, from it all. 'I've gone by a few working names. One of them I went under was Angelina. I had to have a sexier escort name and who better than Angelina Jolie? ' Ms Montenegro said her main clients were white-collar workers peppered with well-known faces - including lawyers, politicians and musicians. To ease her guilt and numb her to the idea of being an escort, Ms Montenegro blew the 'thousands and thousands' she earned on a new car and clothes. She lives in Melbourne and was raised by devout Christian parents. Ms Montenegro is now a business entrepreneur . 'When I moved up in the escort world, I was meeting more influential and richer clients and I had my first experience with cocaine in my early 20s and it was real A-grade stuff – he was a multi-millionaire. I thought: ""Wow, this is really cool"",' she said. 'I ended up actually taking cocaine for six to eight months and I was also on speed. 'It was a lifestyle of cocaine, speed and French champagne.' It was this kind of destructive lifestyle that motivated Ms Montenegro to pen her book. 'People have certain perceptions of escorts - you don't know who could get into it - and I wanted to de-stigmatise it,' she said. 'For those who want to go in to it, I want to get them to really think about it because once you get into it, it really lives with you. 'And I also just wanted to give those people in the [sex] industry a voice because I'm a human being, they're human beings. 'The main thing for me is that if I can change one person from making that decision [to enter the industry] then I would have done something good, something meaningful and that would mean a lot to me.' But there was no one to help Ms Montenegro when her life was skidding out of control and she wanted to get out of industry. 'The money was why I stayed for so long. I was earning thousands upon thousands a week,' she said. 'Money was like a drug - it let me fly around the world.' One of the few perks of her job was being flown around the world and let her escape the reality she was living in. 'One of the most memorable moments I have was getting flown out to Bora Bora,' Ms Montenegro said. 'It was a companionship - it was more a boyfriend experience booking. What made it so memorable was it was beautiful there and I felt like a princess. 'It was really funny because it didn't feel like work as it were. 'It was just an escape for me - I was treated like a human being - so it was pure escapism for me.' Gwyneth Montenegro has finally achieved her dream of becoming a fully licensed commercial pilot at 29 years old . Unfortunately for Ms Montenegro her new-found career was cut short because of kidney failure, preventing her from renewing her pilot's license . Ms Montenegro would disguise the money she made through promotional modelling jobs . During her days as an escort Gwyneth Montenegro chose Angelina as her pseudonym inspired by the actress Angelina Jolie . Though Ms Montenegro said she had no 'horror stories' to tell about her time as an escort, she desperately tried to turn her back on the industry. After she was almost killed in a car crash at the age of 24 while driving her Volkswagen Golf, Ms Montenegro made the brave decision to get out. 'I walked away with severe whiplash and shock and bruises, but I was lucky I walked away virtually unscathed,' she said. 'Thank God for German engineering. It was really my wake-up call.' At the time of the crash, Ms Montenegro's parents thought she was earning her wage as a model but the trauma of her accident sparked a hospital-bed confession about what she was really doing with her life. 'Money was like a drug - it let me fly around the world:' Ms Montenegro said the temptation of making good money while escorting was one she could not refuse . Ms Montenegro writes very frankly in her newly released book about how she was gang-raped at 18, started dancing on table tops at 19 and how she became a 'high-end' escort by 21. 'I was very close to my parents, particularly my dad,' she said. 'I did a little bit of promotional modelling, and how I was able to hide my money and I was able to disguise my money outwardly - new clothes and a new car and everything - was by explaining it through the modelling work I did. 'I was able to hide it pretty well but it was killing me on the inside to keep it such a secret too.' Luckily for Ms Montenegro, even though they didn't like it, her parents were understanding and supportive when they discovered the truth. After the accident, things started to look up when she finally achieved her dream of becoming a fully licensed commercial pilot at 29 years old. But her new life as a charter pilot and doing scenic tours was cut short when she diagnosed with kidney failure, which prevented her from getting medical approval to keep her licence. Again Ms Montenegro fell back into the industry, but finally at 33 she retired and cut off all ties with it when she met her business partner, known only as Roger. She started a course in neuro-linguistic programming and together with Roger they started building a business. 'It’s like mind science – like (famous US life coach) Tony Robbins does – it’s like a new age psychology, and it really helped me deal with a lot of my issues,' she said.","Former elite escort Gwyneth Montenegro has slept with exactly 10,091 men .

"David Cameron's family could have money tied up in offshore tax havens after it was revealed his father made a fortune through a network of offshore investment funds. Ian Cameron, whose wealth was once estimated at £10m, ran several, perfectly legal, offshore accounts in tax havens such as Panama City and Geneva. The Guardian newspaper reports that Ian Cameron, who died in 2010, left a fortune of £2.74m, from which the Prime Minister personally received a sum of £300,000. Funds: The Prime Minister's father Ian Cameron, who died in 2010, ran a network of offshore . accounts designed to avoid paying tax in the United Kingdom . However the will, which is a public document, only lists assets held in England or Wales. Offshore investments would only have been listed in submissions made to HMRC for inheritance tax purposes and it remains unclear exactly what those assets are and which family member owns them. The Prime Minister has been a harsh critic of companies that avoid paying their 'fair share' of tax and recently announced plans to introduce laws to clamp down on the practice. Earlier this year he suggested he would be willing to disclose information about his own financial affairs. In his budget speech last month Chancellor George Osborne described ‘tax evasion and, indeed, aggressive tax avoidance as morally repugnant’. Hypocrite? The Prime Minister, pictured before a meeting with a visiting . Chinese official  this week, has been a . harsh critic of companies and individuals who avoid paying tax . Ian Cameron, who had worked as a city stockbroker, first began setting up investment funds in 1979 shortly after Margaret Thatcher abolished capital controls making it legal to take any sum of money out of the country without it being taxed. He became chairman of Close International Asset management based in Jersey, senior director of Blairmore Holdings Inc registered in Panama and a shareholder in Blairmore Asset Management based in Geneva. Blairmore Holdings, named after the Camerons' ancestral home in Aberdeenshire, was established in 1982 when the Prime Minister was a 16-year-old pupil at Eton. In its investment prospectus for 2006 it states it is seeking 'sophisticated' investors worth at least $100,000 who wished to to legally avoid paying British tax. Haven: Blairmore Asset Management, named after the Cameron's ancestral home, is based in Geneva (pictured) It reads: 'The directors intend that . the affairs on the fund should be managed and conducted so that it does . not become resident in the United Kingdom for UK taxation purposes. 'The fund will not be subject to United Kingdom corporation tax or income tax on its profits.' As a founder member of the fund, which . generated a 116 per cent return from 2002-2007, Ian Cameron was paid a . guaranteed $20,000 a year - the highest paid director. In his budget speech Chancellor George Osborne described tax avoidance as 'morally repugnant' Ian Cameron died in 2010 aged 77. He was survived by his wife Mary Fleur Cameron. In 2006 his eldest son Alexander Cameron QC became the sole owner of the family home in Berkshire estimated to be worth more than £2.5million. Another home in Kensington, London, worth around £1million was passed to his two daughters in equal share. In a speech to business leaders in Maidenhead in January this year The Prime Minister said: 'With the large companies, that have the fancy corporate lawyers and the rest of it, I think we need a tougher approach. 'One of the things that we are going to be looking at this year is whether there should be a general anti-avoidance power that HMRC can use, particularly with very wealthy individuals and with the bigger companies, to make sure they pay their fair share.' Downing Street refused to comment on the story  saying it concerned private matters for the Cameron family. The spokesman said: 'The government's tax reforms are about making sure that some of the richest people in the country pay a decent share of income tax.'",Prime Minister's father Ian Cameron ran funds in Panama and Geneva .

The design comes with a USB charger cable for a laptop or smartphone app allowing women to perform personal check-ups. The Gaga can also be controlled by another person using its wireless app. With a recent survey revealing women are more likely to research embarrasing health symptoms online, rather than book an appointment with a GP, the importance of self-inspection cannot be underestimated.

"Sony came under harsh criticism today after it emerged that a couple managed to broadcast a 20-minute live sex session via a 'chatroom function' on the new PlayStation 4. The man and woman, believed to be Russian, were seen having sex on the PS4's Playroom feature - which allows gamers to use a built-in webcam to communicate with each other. It is meant to encourage users to share their gaming sessions with people all over the world and the Playroom broadcasts can been seen by people of any age using the console's service. Different state of play: A couple, thought to be Russian, filmed themselves having sex, and broadcast it live to thousands on PlayStation 4's chatroom feature Playroom . This week, Playroom for PS4, which does not have a filter for unsuitable content, was used by one couple to broadcast a seedy 20-minute sex session. The pair, believed to be somewhere in Russia, performed a multitude of sex acts which were viewed by more than 1,000 people - some of whom commented on the on-going action. Since its launch last November, more than 4.2 million PlayStation 4 consoles have been sold worldwide. One of the people who saw the footage was Tristan Holtby-Smith, 34, a Gregg's manager of Poole, Dorset. He turned on his PlayStation at about 8am on Monday morning - and the video appeared on the Playroom's 'most popular' section. Popular console: Since its launch last November (pictured), more than 4.2 million PlayStation 4 consoles have been sold worldwide . Mr Holtby-Smith said: ‘I often go to the Playroom on my PlayStation when I don't have much else to do, because you quite often find funny people or gaming sessions there. ‘But when I turned on the system, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. It was so shocking. The Playroom is really a children's game. ‘Some guy and his girlfriend, I think they were Russian because the zoom button was in Russian, were naked and going at it like rabbits. ‘There were more than 1,000 people watching them have sex, and I would bet that some of those viewers were under 18. ‘Once you've signed up for Playroom, you don't need to verify your age, so anybody could have been watching it. ‘It went on for so long as well, at least 20 minutes. It just goes to show that nobody at Sony is paying attention to what is being broadcast.’ The Playroom is a game that comes with every PlayStation 4 console, which allows users to broadcast themselves to other PlayStation users over the internet. Players can leave comments or send messages to each other, which are shared along with the video stream by a third-party company. Unexpected content: Gamers were shocked to discover that the chatroom function was used to broadcast a live sex session (stock image) While the service does require a one-off payment, once that has been set up, there is no filter in place to restrict explicit content. The couple, who went by the online handle g12051992, received more than 150 comments from the thousand people watching their 20-minute lovemaking session. Tristan said: ‘There were definitely children watching that. People of all ages play consoles, and since there was no age filter, there was no way that that could be avoided. ‘It was one of the most watched streams at that time of day. The comments were almost as disgusting as the sex. ‘The couple were loving it - they kept looking at their TV screen and smiling. At one point she adjusted the camera so people could get a better look.’ ‘Porn causes harm to all of us, including those who have never seen any, on many levels.’ Claire Perry, Tory MP for Devizes, who has campaigned for censoring explicit content online, slammed the broadcast. She said: ‘Dear God, this is terrible - and yet another example of why we can't be too vigilant.’ Heike Diaferia, Executive Director of Stop Porn Culture, agreed, criticizing Sony for making such explicit content available, even if the broadcast is moderated by a third party. She said: ‘Since the beginning of the internet, severely damaging hardcore pornography has always been accessible to children of all ages. ‘Certainly, the disturbing live streaming in The Playroom, which is supposed to be a safe game for kids, adds a new layer to what's already available. Sony Computer Entertainment Europe spokesperson David Wilson said: ‘The PlayStation4 system is designed to help gamers share their game play through popular social channels. It is unfortunate that some individuals may abuse this feature and share inappropriate content. He added that within the PlayStation 4 system is a way of setting up parental controls that bans certain people using the console from accessing any user-generated content, such as online messages or video streams.

"Upset: Stewart Rahr took issue with how he was treated at Nobu57 in Manhattan . One of the world's richest men has been banned from top New York restaurant Nobu after the staff said that he allegedly threatened to kill the manager when he didn't get his favorite table. Stewart Rahr, a pharmaceutical billionaire who boasts of his celebrity friends and his lavish lifestyle, reportedly sent a email of complaint to Nobu owner Drew Nieporent. Rahr admits having a disagreement with a female manager but he denies threatening to kill her after she ignored his phone call, according to The New York Post. The paper reports that after the face-to-face confrontation with the manager, he sent a caps-locked tirade to Nieporent, he cc'ed a group of his famous friends including Mark Wahlberg, Leonardo DiCaprio, Alicia Keys, Andre Agassi and Joaquin Phoenix. Three additional recipients have some political pull, including police commissioner Ray Kelly, Rahr's 'buddy' Donald Trump, and actor Robert DeNiro who co-owns the restaurant chain with Nieporent. The dispute stems from an incident where the 66-year-old allegedly got into a verbal altercation with the restaurant's manager Sharon Hofstetter when Rahr tried to get his favorite table on the night of his wife's surprise birthday party. He reportedly walked up to an occupied table and asked the group who was dining there to move so that he could have 'his' table. A bartender told the paper that the group refused and he offered to pay their bill if they would agree. Powerful pals: Rahr prides himself on his celebrity connections, seen here with Prince Harry at a polo match . Close: Rahr (right) sent an email complaint to the owner of Nobu and cc'ed a number of celebrities including Mark Wahlberg (second right). Though in this picture, Cindy Crawford, her husband Rande Gerber, and Jeremy Piven didn't get the email . Rahr, who calls himself 'Stewie Rah Rah- the No. 1 King of Fun', then left an irate message for Hofstetter, who was not at the restaurant at the time of the interaction. She did not call him back immediately so he went to the restaurant on 57th Street to have it out with her in person. 'He called me the c-word and said he would kill me,' Hofstetter told The Post. Rahr tells a different version of the story. He told The Post that Hofstetter was supposed to meet him at his office to plan the party in question, so he went to the restaurant to give her a piece of his mind. 'I told her ""I can't stand you. You're despicable."" Did I curse at her or threaten to kill her? No true- please. I would never say that,' Rahr told the paper. Leading ladies: Rahr has been pictured with Victoria Beckham (left) and model Petra Nemcova (right) Feeling like his message may not be clear, Rahr decided to send the email to Nieporent and copy his A-list pals. 'I GUESS THAT U R MUCH TOO BUSY TO . CALL BACK AN UPSET CUSTOMER. I HAD TOLD U THAT I HAD A MAJOR PROBLEM . & A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE EXPERIENCE CONCERNING A SURPRISE PARTY FOR A . VERY VERY CLOSE FRIEND THIS PAST WEDS,' he wrote in the email. Rahr, . who owned drug manufacturer Kinray until he sold it for $1.3billion in . 2010, went on to talk about his wealth in the email, using it as an . unexpected way to rub his business savvy in Nieporent's face. 'I . HAD ONLY 3 employees & revenues of only $40,000... WHEN I RECENTLY . SOLD MY company last year I EMPLOYED almost 2,000 employees n REVENUES . of $5,000,000,000 (thats what 5 BILLION (W AN 'B' AS IN BOY NOT AN 'M' AS IN MAN...' he wrote in the angry- and typo-laden- email. Similar skin colors: Rahr, seen here with close friend Donald Trump, also sent the real estate mogul the email complaining about the service he received at Nobu . Banned: Now Rahr is no longer welcome at any of Nobu's 25 locations around the world . Now, Rahr is no longer welcome at any of the 25 international Nobu locations. Given his propensity to go heavy on the self tanner (having had a skin cancer scare several years ago) and trademark uniform of purple t-shirts and yellow Ray Ban sunglasses, it would be easy to spot him if he tried to sneak in. This is far from the first time that Rahr has used his connections to make a point, as he was described in a New York Observer profile of showing off his hundreds of posed photos with various celebrities. And he has no problem expressing his distaste for others: he openly bad-mouthed Tiger Woods, calling him 'the most selfish guy I know out of the 500 celebrities on this wall', and had a PR back-and-forth over a slight to comedian George Lopez.","Stewart Rahr was upset because another group was seated at 'his' table .

"A Swiss teenager suffered second and third degree burns when her smartphone apparently exploded in her pocket. Fanny Schlatter, 18, was injured when the Samsung Galaxy S3 allegedly blew up in her trouser pocket. She claims to have been left with no feeling in her right thigh and said she will be launching a criminal complaint against Samsung. Fanny Schlatter, 18, pictured, from Switzerland suffered second and third degree burns when her Samsung Galaxy S3, shown here, exploded in her pocket . In July 2013, a Swiss teenager suffered burns when her smartphone apparently exploded in her pocket . French language paper Le Matin reported that Ms Schlatter was working as an painting apprentice when she heard a large bang. She told the paper: ‘All of a sudden I heard the sound of an explosion – like a firecracker. 'Then I noticed a strange chemical smell and my work trousers began to catch fire.’ By the time Ms Schlatter’s boss, Stephane Kubler, had come to her assistance, the flames had reached her shoulders. According to reports in the French-language Le Matin newspaper, 18-year-old Ms Schlatter was working as an apprentice painter when her smartphone exploded in the pocket of her work trousers, pictured . The exploding Samsung handset caused a fire in Ms Schlatter's trousers, pictured, and the flames then spread to her shoulders . She was rushed into the nearest bathroom where colleagues doused the flames before driving her to hospital. Ms Schlatter explained: ‘Luckily my hair was tied up and my sweater didn’t have time to catch fire.’ However, she added that her burns were severe enough to make her smell like a ‘burnt pig’. The burns have left Ms Schlatter with no feeling in her right thigh and the teenager has been signed off work until 15 August. She now plans to file a legal complaint against the Korean phone maker. In a statement, a Samsung spokesperson told the MailOnline: 'Once we have gotten hold of the product in question, we will conduct a thorough examination to determine the exact cause of this incident. 'We would like to assure our . customers that we have always employed strict quality control and safety . standards to ensure a safe and pleasant user experience.' This is not the first time a Samsung Galaxy S3 battery has supposedly exploded. In May this year, Reddit user Vizionx1208 posted pictures of his destroyed Samsung Galaxy S3 smartphone, claiming he was 'awoken by a . loud noise and a weird squeaking sound.' He states the phone was on the verge of setting alight and his bedroom had filled with smoke and had a 'pungent smell.' Ms Schlatter claims she has been left with no feeling in her right thigh following the fire and is launching a criminal complaint against Korean phone maker Samsung . He was able to put out the smouldering phone by chucking a glass of water over it but the phone had already burnt his mattress cover and left a small burn on his finger. Last year, an Irish Samsung S3 owner claimed his handset burst into flames as he was driving his car. However, . it was later discovered, following tests by the Fire . Investigations UK (FIUK) team, that the phone had been previously placed . in the microwave to remove water damage and this may have been the . cause of the fire. It isn't just the S3 model that has this supposed fault either. In . South Korea in 2011, the battery from a Samsung Galaxy Note allegedly . exploded in a man's pocket as he walked along the street. The explosion caused second degree burns and a one-inch wound to his thigh. Miss Schlatter's thigh suffered second and third degree burns when the phone exploded in her pocket. She said the burns were severe enough to make her smell like a 'burnt pig' It was the second time that year a battery from the Galaxy Note was said to have exploded in South Korea. Elsewhere, a phone battery spontaneously caught fire in a man's back pocket at the Defcon hacking conference in the U.S in 2010, and in 2009, a man was killed when his exploding phone severed his neck artery. Last month, a fire in a Peterborough house was thought to have been caused by an exploding phone battery after a handset was left on charge overnight. The fire crews did not release what make or model the battery came from but said damage was caused to the bedroom, where the phone was on charge, including the bed, furniture and serious smoke damage to the walls.","Fanny Schlatter's Samsung S3 is thought to have set fire in her pocket .

"Oscar Pistorius yesterday appeared . before a packed court and categorically denied murdering his model . girlfriend, insisting he had been deeply in love with her. The 26-year-old Blade Runner said he . mistook Reeva Steenkamp for an intruder and shot her through the locked . door of a toilet in his mansion home. He said he thought she was in his bed . when he opened fire. ‘I kicked the door open, I tried to help her but . she died in my arms,’ he said in his first account of what happened on . the night 29-year-old law graduate Miss Steenkamp died. Scroll down for video . Account: Pistorius claimed he mistook his girlfriend for a burglar and is back in court today to argue for bail . Compeling: In a statement read out to Pretoria magistrates court, the Paralympic athlete said he had been on the balcony of his house when he heard noises from the bathroom . Decision: The judge said he will consider downgrading the charge but the news brought Pistorius to tears . Pistorius sobbed uncontrollably as . Barry Roux, one of South Africa’s leading defence lawyers, read the . athlete’s statement to Pretoria magistrate Desmond Nair, asking that he . be allowed bail. The hushed court also heard a . statement from a close friend of Miss Steenkamp who said the model and . law graduate had told her ‘she would marry Oscar Pistorius if he asked . her. She said he was intense but she loved him’. He treated her ‘like . gold’. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel painted a very . different version of the events in the early hours of Valentine’s Day. He said Pistorius had shot his cowering girlfriend in cold blood. ‘She . couldn’t go anywhere,’ Mr Nel said. ‘It must have been horrific.’ Listening:  His brother and sister were in court today. The sportsman was accused of grabbing his gun and strapping on his prosthetic legs before walking seven metres and shooting dead the model . Stress: Oscar Pistorius's father Henke Pistorius is comforted by a unidentified family member while another reacts to the statement read out during the hearing . Reflection: His father looks down after his son's bail hearing was adjourned at the Magistrate Court in Pretoria to allow the prosecution time to study affidavits submitted by the defence . Version: A graphic illustrating a suggested representation of the events that lead to Reeva Steenkamp's death on the morning of February 14 . Scene of horror: This is the toilet cubicle where Reeva Steenkamp was found 'slumped over but alive' after being shot three times through the locked door . Hearing: Olympian Oscar Pistorius, pictured with his head under a blanket, leaves the Brooklyn Police Station in Pretoria, en route to magistrates court . Legal: Oscar Pistorius's defence team,  Advocate Barry Roux arriving. Mr Roux said the shooting was accidental: 'We submit it is not even murder. There is no concession this is a murder' Difficult hearing: Oscar Pistorius's brother Carl Pistorius and sister Aimee arriving at the Pretoria Magistrate Court this morning before listening to the grim details . Answers: Miss Steenkamp's funeral was held today. Her family have demanded to know why their 'beautiful angel' was blasted to death with his 9mm gun and have begged the sprinter to 'tell the truth' about the shooting . Grief: Miss Steenkamp's dad Barry (second left) arrives at the crematorium building in Port Elizabeth . Grief: Adam Steenkamp, centre left, the brother of Reeva Steenkamp walks in the procession . Support: June Steenkamp (centre)  is comforted by another mourner at the service less than a week after her daughter was shot dead . Respect: Springboks rugby player Francois Hougaard arrives . Mission: Her brother, Adam Steenkamp, said after the service: 'We're going to keep all the positive things that we remember and know about my sister and we will try and continue with the things that she tried to make better' Statement: Pistorius said that he was 'deeply in love' with his girlfriend and that she had bought him a Valentine's Day present . As Pistorius's relatives supported him in court, the distraught family of Miss Steenkamp attended her funeral in Port Elizabeth. Her brother Adam said that her death had 'left space missing inside all of the people that she knew.' But there was also anger. Gavin Venter, an ex-jockey who worked for . Reeva's father, called for the harshest of sentences for Pistorius. In court the prosecutor told the bail hearing the couple . had had a shouting match and Miss Steenkamp fled to the bathroom and . locked herself in. She was an ‘unarmed, innocent woman’. But Mr Roux . insisted there was no evidence to substantiate a murder charge. ‘There . is no concession this is a murder,’ he said. It was theme underlined by Pistorius . in his affidavit. He said: ‘I fail to understand how I could be charged . with murder, let alone premeditated murder because… I had no intention . to kill my girlfriend.’ He said on the evening of February 13 they had decided to stay in and had gone to bed. ‘I’m acutely aware of people gaining . entries to homes to commit crime, I’ve received death threats. I sleep . with my 9mm under my bed.’ He said he heard a noise in the bathroom . after getting up to close a sliding door. ‘I was scared and didn’t . switch on the light. Protesting: 'Rot in jail, was the message from women's groups outside the hearing . Tensions running high: Women protest outside the Pretoria Magistrates court, during the bail application hearing . Pistorius has applied to the central firearms registry as collector to these firearms. Six applications are pending, but any charge of violent crime will make it unlikely that firearm licenses will be granted. ‘I got my gun and moved towards the . bathroom. I screamed at the intruder because I did not have my legs on I . felt vulnerable. I fired shots through the bathroom door and told Reeva . to call police. ‘I walked back to the bed and realised . Reeva was not in bed. It then it dawned on me it could be her in there. It filled me with horror and fear.’ He put on his prosthetic legs, . tried to kick down the door, then bashed it in with a cricket bat to . find Miss Steenkamp dying. ‘She died in my arms,’ he said. ‘I am absolutely mortified at the death of my beloved Reeva.’ As Mr Roux read the statement, . Pistorius wept and Mr Nair halted proceedings for several minutes. ‘You . need to concentrate on what’s going on,’ he told Pistorius. Statements from four friends were also . read to the court which painted a picture of a ‘humble’ man who was . considering building a future with Miss Steenkamp. Mr Nair ruled that Pistorius should be . charged with premeditated murder, a ‘category six’ offence that will . make it very difficult for him to be granted bail. Last night lawyers for Pistorius took . the unusual step of releasing his full statement. Describing the moment . he thought an intruder had broken in, the statement said: ‘I felt a . sense of terror rushing over me. There are no bars across the bathroom . window and I knew contractors had left ladders outside.’ The statement . told how the toilet was in cubicle within the bathroom. ‘On my way to . the bathroom I screamed words to the effect for him/them to get out of . my house and for Reeva to phone the police. It was pitch dark. ‘I noticed that the bathroom window was open. I realised that the intruder was in the toilet. ‘I thought he or they must have . entered through the unprotected window.’ He said he then opened fire . believing his girlfriend was still in bed. The hearing was adjourned. The BBC has apologised after the 9am bulletin on Radio 6 Music, featuring a report on Pistorius, was followed by a song about a man shooting his girlfriend – the Jimi Hendrix Experience version of Hey Joe. The track includes the lines: ‘Hey Joe, where you going with that gun in your hand? I’m going out to shoot my old lady, you know I caught her messing around with another man.’","Pistorius at court again this morning to beg for bail .

"A mob marched nuns through the battle-torn streets of Cairo ‘like prisoners of war’ in the latest outrage against Egypt’s Christian minority. Sister Manal, principal of a Franciscan school in suburban Cairo, watched for six hours as a mob looted the building, knocked the cross off the gate and replaced it with a black banner resembling the flag of Al Qaeda. The classrooms were then burned to the ground and the women taken away, attracting a crowd of abusive onlookers. An Egyptian army officer raises his gun at the crowd outside a mosque in Cairo. Elsewhere nuns were paraded like 'prisoners of war' after Franciscan School attacked by Islamists . Almost 900 have died during four days of extreme violence between police and activists supporting ousted President Morsi . Police told Sister Manal that the nuns had been targeted by hardline Islamists, convinced that they had given Muslim children an inappropriate education. ‘We are nuns. We rely on God and the angels to protect us,’ she said. ‘At the end, they paraded us like prisoners of war and hurled abuse at us as they led us from one alley to another without telling us where they were taking us.’ Siblings Wardah and Bedour, two Christian women employed by the school, also found themselves having to fight their way through the mob while being groped, hit and insulted by the extremists. So far two Christians have been killed since the military-backed government moved against protesters calling for former president Mohamed Morsi’s reinstatement. And dozens of churches, homes and businesses owned by Christians have been attacked and razed to the ground. Armoured vehicles are pictured stationed in front of the Egyptian Museum in Tahrir Square . ‘I am terrified and unable to focus,’ said Boulos Fahmy, the pastor of a Catholic church a short distance away . from Manal’s school. ‘I am expecting an attack on my church any time . now.’ And Bishop Ibram, head of the local Coptic Orthodox church, said he had instructed Christians and clerics not to resist the mobs of Islamists to try and avoid any loss of life. ‘The looters were so diligent that they came back to one of the five churches they had already ransacked to see if they could get more,’ he said. ‘They were loading our chairs and our benches on trucks and when they had no space for more, they just destroyed them.’ Christians have long suffered from discrimination and violence in Egypt, where they make up 10 per cent of the population of 90million. Women supporting President Morsi take to the streets during continued protests in Cairo . The number of anti-Christian attacks increased after the Arab Spring uprising that drove Hosni Mubarak from power in 2011 and saw the rise of extremists. But Christians have faced increasing violence ever since Morsi was ousted on July 3, sparking a wave of Islamist anger led by his Muslim Brotherhood party. Clashes on Saturday between police and supporters of the country’s ousted president killed 79 people, according to Egypt’s interim government. This brings the death toll after four days of extreme violence in the country to 888 people. Gunmen fired on trucks carrying more than 600 prisoners rounded up in earlier street violence between Egyptian security forces and Muslim Brotherhood supporters.","Franciscan School looted and classrooms burned to the ground .

"A patient left worried for his own nutrition has revealed the pitiful meals he was given while being cared for at a new hospital. Steven Williams spent eight days at Southmead Hospital in Bristol after having an operation on his feet. Every day, the 29-year-old was given tiny portions of food at the £430million facility, including a roast dinner with just one floret of broccoli. Steven Williams was given this tiny roast dinner with just one floret of broccoli, two potatoes, two pieces of cauliflower and fatty beef at Southmead Hospital . The 29-year-old was dismayed with the small portions he was given. This half-plate of chilli con carne was one of the meals he received . When the photographer asked for a different topping on a baked potato, he was given this small cheese sandwich instead . The photographer has shared pictures of the dishes he was served up by hospital staff every day to expose the hospital which belongs to North Bristol NHS Trust - one of the first in the country to win a catering award. 'It was shocking. It was just diabolical. 'In a way, it shouldn't have been sent from the kitchen. It wasn't great service. My family were bringing me food from home in a Tupperware. 'The food was horrible. It was not great at all. To be quite honest, I think a dog wouldn’t eat what they were serving.' Among the meals he was given was a pathetic roast dinner with just one head of broccoli, two small pieces of cauliflower, two potatoes and fatty beef. On another day he was given a half-plate portion of chilli con carne with rice. 'There was no balance in the food, especially in the calorie intake. There was no way we were getting what we needed. 'There was even a member of staff who said they were concerned. 'The portions were so tiny. I have a two year old girl and she would eat more than that. 'The worst meal I got was the Sunday roast. The meat was fatty and chewy and it tasted like tinned potatoes. 'I ordered some cheese and biscuits one night. There were just two crackers and a travel pack of cheese. 'I just had these two crackers with a tiny bit of cheese between them. Mr Williams said not even his two-year-old daughter would be satisfied with the food he was given following an operation on his feet . The hospital (pictured) belongs to North Bristol NHS Trust which has been given a silver award in food catering . 'One meal tasted like they have tipped a whole tin of seasoning on.' Southmead Hospital opened in May this year as part of the Private Finance Initiative. After almost 10 years of construction, the hospital was forced to cancel 180 operations before opening its doors due to a problem with its air conditioning. It is part of North Bristol NHS Trust which has a silver Food for Life catering award from the Soil Association. But Mr Williams claims the portion size was not the only thing wrong with the food. The new £430 million hospital Southmead Hospital opened in May this year as part of the Private Finance Initiative . 'One night there was jacket potato with pasta. I asked for beans or cheese instead but that’s all they had.' 'They don’t cater for everyone. That’s how I ended up with a cheese sandwich one night. If you don’t like the second choice you are left with a sandwich. 'I have to go back to have plaster removed. 'Hopefully I won’t have to stay though and if so I’ll take my own food.' Simon Wood, Director of Facilities at North Bristol NHS Trust said: 'I would like to offer sincere apologies to Mr Williams. 'We take great pride in our patient meals which contain high-quality ingredients, are nutritionally balanced and cooked in-house. 'The photographs he took do not show the meals we would aspire to provide, particularly the portion size which is short of what it should be and is certainly not typical of what we serve. 'We have spoken to the staff who serve meals on the ward Mr Williams was treated to ensure they are fully aware of how they should serve the food and to re-iterate how much should be on the patients’ plates. 'We did try to address Mr Williams’ concerns directly with him but unfortunately he was discharged before our catering manager could talk to him. 'If anyone . has any concerns about their food whilst with us, we would ask that they . talk to one of the ward staff so their concerns can be addressed . immediately.' Forty . per cent of adult hospital patients and 15 per cent of children are . malnourished on admission, half of these severely so, according to the . malnutrition charity BAPEN. The . majority who depend on hospital food for all their nutrition continue . to lose weight while in hospital, reflecting the inadequacy of current . feeding policies. Between . 30 and 50 per cent of hospital food is wasted - and average food . intakes are less than 75 per cent of that recommended, particularly . among the elderly. Guidance . from the British Dietetic Association (BDA) stipulates that adults of a . healthy weight (classed as nutritionally well) should consume between . 1,810 and 2,550 calories a day while in hospital. Those classed as 'nutritionally vulnerable' should be given between 2,250 - 2,625. Hospitals should be following the following strict guidelines when it comes to food, according to the British Dietetic Association . Protein . is vital to recovery and building up muscle strength.

"Shock jock Howard Stern is causing a stir again - this time after ridiculing star of the moment Lena Dunham's looks and saying sex scenes in the series Girls are like rape. Cashing in on the publicity of the show's new series, Stern decided to make Dunham the target of his ire on his radio show this week. He said the writer and star of the series was 'a little fat girl' who looks 'kinda like Jonah Hill' before he promptly dismissed the acclaim awarded to the hit show. Scroll down for video . Outspoken: Shock jock Howard Stern, left, used his radio show to air his views on the hit-show Girls and to ridicule the looks of the main star Lena Dunham, right. Fans have hit back at the 59-year-old, calling him a 'bully' 'It's a little fat girl who kinda looks like Jonah Hill and she keeps taking her clothes off and it kind of feels like rape. She seems -- it's like -- I don't want to see that,' Stern said. The 59-year-old also criticized the show . for focusing too much on the exploits of Dunham's character Hannah . Horvath. He says he was introduced to the show by his wife Beth Ostrosky . but has obviously watched enough to become acquainted with the format. 'I learned that this little fat chick . writes the show and directs the show and that makes sense to me because . she's such a camera hog that the other characters barely are on.' 'My opinion, if I was a producer on . that, I'd say, 'Honey, you're a little too close to the project. You . need to allow the other characters to breathe a little and let us get . invested in them,' he continued. 'Good for her. It's hard for little fat chicks to get anything going.' Non-plussed: Girls star Lena Dunham was unmoved by Howard Stern's comments ridiculing her looks and criticizing the hit show . Unfortunately for Stern,  26-year-old Dunham is also the show's producer but she said she had no hard feelings against the America's Got Talent judge. 'I did find out that Howard Stern really hates [Girls]. I'm a Howard Stern fan, and really think he has earned the right to free speech and he should just go for it,"" she told David Letterman on the Late Show Thursday. 'But he did say something that is so funny that I wanna get it on my gravestone: 'Congrats to her . (Dunham). It's so hard for little fat chicks to get anything going these . days',' she said 'I want my gravestone to say, 'she was a little fat chick and she got it going'. Letterman then joked: 'I think that's the essence of life's struggle, . isn't it? Before you go to bed tonight, before your head hits the . pillow, please consider little fat chicks and how hard it is to get . things going.' Hit: The award-winning series Girls returns to HBO tonight. Howard Stern has criticized it but his comments were laughed off by director and star Lena Dunham . Runaway success: Girls was a major hit in its first series. Fans turned on radio-host Howard Stern who criticized it this week while others joined in ridiculing the popular program . Although she clearly doesn't need any back-up, fans of the show have since turned on Stern branding him a bully. Several also pointed out he isn't male model material himself. One woman wrote on Twitter: 'Howard Stern talking about not liking 'little fat chicks' on t.v. is bizarre, since he has a face only radio could love.' Celebrity trainer, Tracy Anderson told USWeekly: 'He’s, like, literally desensitized himself so much over the years. That guy . doesn’t know what’s sexy.

"You can almost hear the collective gasp of horror in clubhouses across the land. Carly Booth has staked her claim as the new face – and more to the point new body – of women’s golf by stripping off for a daring photoshoot. The 21-year-old posed nude for a sports magazine before taking part in the Ricoh Women’s British Open in St Andrews, Scotland this weekend. Carly Booth posed nude for a sports magazine before taking part in the Ricoh Women's British Open in St Andrews, Scotland . And if the former private schoolgirl’s naked ambition wasn’t enough to shock some of the more genteel members of the golf community, her tattoos might be. She has five in total, one of which – on her hip – is a quote adapted from Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar. Miss Booth has said she wanted to make golf more appealing for girls . The professional golfer, who attended the independent Glenalmond College in Perthshire, said she took some persuading to do the shoot, for ESPN Magazine’s ‘The Body Issue’. ‘It took me a while to decide that it was something I wanted to do,’ she said. ‘The more I looked into it and saw the type of athletes that had done it before, then I realised it was a great honour to be asked.’ Her father Wally, 73, was relaxed about the pictures – but not about the tattoos. Mr Booth, a former silver medallist in wrestling at the Commonwealth Games, said: ‘I looked at the picture – it isn’t sexy or anything – and just saw the tattoo because I didn’t know she had one. ‘When I was younger people with tattoos were getting them taken off, so I’ve always been against them.’ Miss Booth said she wanted to make golf more appealing for girls. ‘I paint my nails, I wear big earrings,’ she explained. ‘I wear a lot of colour, but I wear pink the most. ‘I think it’s only going to be a positive outcome if we all try to make ladies’ golf a bit more glamorous. Male golf has been more dominant. We want young girls to see us and think, “Oh, I love her – I love what she’s wearing”. We want them to pick up the sport and we want to be good role models.’ Miss Booth in action at the Ricoh Women's British Open at St Andrews .","Carly Booth posed nude for magazine before Ricoh Women's British Open .

"Fifty per cent of women admit to using them - and a little known fact is that they were the fifth domestic appliance to be made electric, following the sewing machine, fan, kettle, and toaster. But nonetheless, the vibrator is still a taboo topic. Worse still, travelling with one - particularly in these days of hand luggage only - has the potential to turn into a humiliating nightmare (just ask Tulisa Contostavlos, who was stopped at airport security because 'something' in her bag was vibrating.) But one company think they have the answer. Lovehoney have unveiled the Tingletip - a discreet £9.99 gizmo that fits directly on to your electric toothbrush. Discreet? A sexy toy company have unveiled the £9.99 Tingletip, which fits onto your electric toothbrush and acts as a vibrator . Designed to be fitted on top of your electric toothbrush, the device, which says it is designed to work with 'all Braun Oral-B electric toothbrushes' uses the vibrations of the brush to turn the covered tip into a clitoral stimulator. Describing the intriguing device on their website, manufacturers Lovehoney call it 'a breakthrough in electric toothbrush technology'. Nothing to see here! The vibrator is perfect for sneaking through airport security . 'Unlike . anything else on the market, the Tingletip fits directly on to your . electric toothbrush (not over the top), producing orgasmic vibrations . from start to finish,' they say. Speaking about the device, sexpert Tracey Cox said: 'They're . actually quite good and more powerful than they look. 'Plus ideal for women who . feel embarrassed about travelling with a traditional vibrator in case their . bags get searched.

"David Cameron says parents will have more control . Children will be protected by a block on online pornography which parents will have to choose to have lifted, David Cameron vows today. After weeks of confusion over the Government’s plans to protect youngsters, the Prime Minister makes clear that under the proposals, web filters will be ‘default on’ for houses with children. In an article for the Daily Mail, the Prime Minister says it is ‘utterly appalling’ that so many children have been exposed to the ‘darkest corners’ of the internet, adding: ‘A silent attack on innocence is under way in our country today and I am determined that we fight it with all we’ve got.’ He announces that Conservative MP Claire Perry, who has led the campaign for a broader, automatic block on adult material for all internet users, is to be appointed as his adviser on reversing the commercialisation and sexualisation of childhood. She will be in charge of implementing the new web filter system, which will also require internet providers to check the age of the person setting controls. Mr Cameron’s intervention follows a concerted campaign for an automatic block by this newspaper and will be welcomed by campaigners on child internet safety, although concerns remain about how the Government plans to address children accessing porn via their own smartphones, and phones and tablets such as iPads using public wi-fi. Ministers were criticised last week when they appeared to have rejected calls for an automatic block on adult material for all households. Critics said ministers had put the . profits of internet giants ahead of the safety of children by vetoing an . ‘opt-in’ system, under which adults could only see adult images if they . specifically asked to do so. There will be internet options to block particular kinds of content, individual sites or restrict access at specific times of the day (posed by model) Mr Cameron, however, insists it is clear that a ‘more sophisticated system’ will be more effective – arguing that straightforward ‘on/off’ filters are so wide-ranging that parents often switch them off in frustration when they block innocent sites. The Prime Minister says the Mothers’ Union, which has advised the Government on how to shield children from adult and violent internet content, is backing alternative proposals to allow parents to tailor exactly what they can and cannot see. MP Claire Perry led the campaign for a broader, automatic block . Ministers are understood to have imposed a timetable on internet providers, who will be required to raise their game and produce detailed plans by February on ensuring that all parents are giving the option of imposing filters. Mr Cameron says that when people switch on a new computer, they will be asked if there are children in the house – and if they answer yes, they will be automatically prompted to tailor internet filters. They will include options to block particular kinds of content, individual sites or restrict access at specific times of the day. If parents click through the options to set up a new system quickly, filters against pornography and self-harm sites will be automatically left on. ‘So this is a kind of “default on” for houses with children; it’s just that it adds much more control for parents about exactly what is restricted,’ the Prime Minister writes. Mrs Perry, MP for Devizes and a Parliamentary aide at the Ministry of Defence, said she welcomed the Prime Minister’s plans. ‘Clearly, like many others I thought an opt-in was the simplest and best way to do it,’ she said. ‘But you have to listen when you do consultations. It is clear people think that more needs to be done, but there isn’t a majority in favour of an automatic block. If you have proper age verification systems, then I think this new system will put us a long way ahead of the rest of the world. ‘As near as damn it, we have got what we want and most campaigners are quite happy. The industry has, with a few notable exceptions, been quite slow but there is now good momentum. It will be my job to make sure it all gets implemented.’ Mrs Perry said effective checks on the age of a person setting up filters – probably using credit card details and the electoral roll – would be vital to ensure children could not get round the new system. Access to adult content via smartphones remained a concern, but she said all parents signing a mobile contract should be offered the chance to set up a filter. Jon Brown of the NSPCC said the charity still believed an ‘opt in’ system was the best way to protect children, but called the Prime  Minister’s proposals ‘a big step in the right direction’. A survey by the charity Childline of 851 youngsters – most aged between 11 and 15 – revealed that two in five young people have seen or read something online that upset them. Some 56 per cent of youngsters said they believed all illegal or inappropriate material should be filtered out as standard. Recently there has been a lot of debate about how we protect our children from damaging influences online: pornography, suicide websites, violent videos and so on. Let me be clear right from the start: I am a father of three young children and I take this issue extremely seriously. To me, the fact that so many children have visited the darkest corners of the internet is not just a matter of concern – it is utterly appalling. A silent attack on innocence is underway in our country today and I am determined that we fight it with all we’ve got. Some might ask why, then, this Government has not taken the route of ‘default on’ filters for new computers, so that each one that is bought comes with blanket filters for all unsuitable content.There’s a simple reason why  we haven’t done this: all the  evidence suggests such a crude system wouldn’t work very well  in practice. With the system, when people switch on their new computer, a question will pop up asking if there are children in the house. If there are, then parents will be automatically prompted to tailor their internet filters (posed by model) Take the experience of one parent I met. She has a tablet computer which her young daughter sometimes plays games on. It’s got straightforward ‘on/off’ filters, so she turned the filter ‘on’ to protect her daughter. However, the filters were so wide-ranging that she then found she couldn’t access things like TV stations on demand; they were blocked too. The result? She just switched the filter off again, as it was becoming annoying. The point is we need a more sophisticated system than  this – one that allows parents to tailor exactly what their children can see. This is what child safety experts recommend. It’s what Reg Bailey, the head of the Mothers’ Union, recommends. So that’s exactly what we’re bringing in. With our system, when people switch on their new computer, a question will pop up asking if there are children in the house. If there are, then parents will be automatically prompted to tailor their internet filters. Want to restrict access to Facebook after 8pm? Decide to allow younger children to view fewer sites than their older siblings? Or want to stop access to certain sites altogether? Now you will be shown how to do it. To make this doubly safe, if parents just repeatedly click ‘OK’ to get through the filter set-up quickly, then filters against the most obvious threats – like pornography and self-harm sites – will be left on. So this is a kind of ‘default on’ for houses with children; it’s just that it adds much more control for parents about exactly what is restricted. We’ve also said that providers need to work to verify the age of the person setting the controls – meaning that children can’t set up the filters themselves. Let me reiterate the key points: with our new system, every parent will be prompted to protect their child online. If they don’t make choices, protection will be automatically on. No other Government has taken such radical steps before. And once all this is in place, Britain will have the most robust internet child protection measures of any country in the world – bar none. To get all this underway, I have appointed Claire Perry MP to be my adviser on preventing the sexualisation and commercialisation of childhood. Claire is a passionate campaigner for internet safety and mother of three. Her job will be to see this through, to get internet companies on board, to do what it takes to protect children and young people online. All this comes back to something really important. It’s not just about the internet, or modern technology – it’s about childhood. These should be distinct  and precious years, full of security and love, untainted by  the worries and complexities  of adulthood. From one parent to another,  I pledge to do whatever I can to preserve that innocence and  protect our children. Nothing matters more.","Prime Minister says it is 'utterly appalling that children are exposed to the 'darkest corners' of the internet .

"Fifty Shades of Grey has got nothing on the sexual awakening of one British mother who has self-published her own 'erotic true-life memoir' on Amazon. Emma Styles, a married mother-of-two from Kew, London, has written First Tango In Paris, in which she relates how she went from being a bored housewife to having outrageous sexual encounters with a string of lovers including  a team of firefighters and a distinguished French diplomat. Emma explains how her 'sexual journey' began when she was 29-years-old and she and her husband, Paul, took an eye-opening trip to Paris. Erotic journey: Emma Styles went from being a bored housewife to having a 'decadent' sex life with multiple lovers . She writes: 'Until that night I was living a relatively normal existence as a married woman with two young children in a small commuter town in Surrey. I was a 29-year-old stay at home mum, whose husband Paul worked long and intense hours in the music Industry, which meant he wasn’t around as much as other fathers and do his share of child care, however, the financial rewards were worth it.' The couple started out attending sex shows and venues famed for swinging but were initially 'both reticent, and unsure as how each other would react if either had any intimate contact with anyone else.' But she recalls how an encounter with a French couple, Olivier and Claudia, at a club that 'appealled to the higher echelons of the Parisian swinging culture' caused them to relax their 'rules of engagement'. Experimental: Emma said her encounters with other men enhanced her sex life with her husband (posed by models) Emma relates how she had an intimate sexual encounter with Olivier in an alcove of the club after they left their respective partners to buy drinks. She said of the liaison: 'I was in complete ecstasy, not having had this level of close up personal attention from another man in seven years of marriage.' 'I was in complete ecstasy, not having . had this level of close up personal attention from another man in seven . years of marriage' When they returned to their partners and Claudia asked 'if she could take Paul and . show him around her ""favourite areas"" of the club' she said 'who was I to argue!' While some people may be horrified at the thought of their husband or wife with another person, Emma said it enhanced their marriage. She said: 'Our personal sex life had become very intense, and experimental, with . Paul, who during our lovemaking was very much into having me tell him in . detail about my liaison with Olivier, and what else I wished I'd done . with him, and would do if the opportunity arose in the future. This very . much excited him.' Liberated: The mother went on to have numerous sexual encounters juggling family life with exploring her fantasies (posed by models) Real erotica: Emma said her book is all true . From then on, the couple become much more adventurous with Emma learning how to 'juggle her family life in West London with her decadent sexual life in France and beyond.' She said: 'All the liaisons took place with my husband, or flying solo, as a . fully liberated woman (with his full approval), who knows what she wants . and lets nothing stop her from turning her fantasies into reality… . however unattainable they may seem.' Emma told MailOnline her book differs from the many other erotic novels currently storming the bestseller lists because it's all true - and she isn't hiding behind a pseudonym. She said: 'Where my book is different is that it is a true-life memoir of my sexual journey emanating from a weekend break to Paris back in 1991 and my subsequent story. 'The book is not a novella written by a faceless person usually using a ridiculous pen name such as Portia, Skye etc with equally unbelievable central characters with names such as Ayden, Gideon and Steele. I have never met people with such names in the real world.' She added: 'I don't in any way class my book as pornography but pure and simple factual erotica written for today's modern woman by a woman who is real and has lived it. 'I hope it inspires women from wherever and whatever age you are, to . embrace your sexuality, and explore fully the deep dark erotic side that . we all have (some hidden deeper than others).'","Emma Styles has written First Tango In Paris .

"A 39-year-old security guard born without a penis is set to become one of the first men in the world to be given an entirely new manhood - made from his arm. Andrew Wardle, from Stalybridge, Greater Manchester, was born with an ectopic bladder, meaning it formed on the outside of his body. He had testicles but not a penis and, while he had a successful operation as a child to move his bladder to where it should be, his lack of manhood remained. But all that is set to change after surgeons at University College London agreed to a complicated three-part operation, involving the transfer of skin from his forearm. New man: Andrew Wardle from Stalybridge, Manchester, was born without a penis but, at aged 39, looks set to be given a new manhood by surgeons who will operate using skin and nerves from his forearm . Surgeons will use a large flap of skin with its blood vessels and nerves and fold it into a tube before grafting it into the pubic area. After healing, Mr Wardle will be fitted with a pump-operated implant to make passing urine - and sex - possible. Speaking to The Sun, Mr Wardle said: 'I never thought this day would come and I still can’t believe it is possible for me to actually have a fully functioning penis. If it’s a success, I can finally start living like a normal man. 'Things like having sex and starting a family, something which so many people take for granted, could actually become a possibility.' Despite his lack of penis, Mr Wardle has still been a hit with the ladies, claiming to have slept with more than 100. 'Some were one-night stands, some long-term relationships. I’ve told 20 . per cent of them the truth,' he said. 'The . fact I didn’t just want to get my leg over made me more attractive to . women. I had charm and patter because it wasn’t all about sex.' Despite this, though, Mr Wardle's birth defect has caused him no end of problems. His mother, who was just 17, gave him up for adoption and then, growing up, he had countless kidney problems and infections and underwent 15 operations to build a tube from his bladder so he could pass water normally. Because he was in and out of hospital, he was bullied at school — although, as he has done all his life, he managed to keep his big secret from his friends and classmates. It was when he became interested in girls as a teenager that problems keeping his secret began. The only physical sensation he felt with women were butterflies in his stomach but his first girlfriend at 17 was understanding when he explained the situation to her and they dated for four years before eventually splitting because she 'wanted to experience things I was unable to do'. Groundbreaking: The surgery, which is being carried out at University College London, will involve three operations taking a total of 12 hours. Born Again: Mr Wardle says the operation will be like starting his life again and hopes it will allow him to have children . It wasn't long before Mr Wardle turned to drugs like ecstasy and LSD as a coping mechanism. He said: 'By taking drugs I gave myself the perfect cover. I’d bed girls but said things could only go so far because the drugs meant I couldn’t rise to the occasion.' But Mr Wardle, whose work as a bartender, chef and security guard meant he moved around Spain and Eastern Europe, faced some negative reactions when he revealed he could not have sex, with one girl punching him in the face and another cheating on him. Two years ago, he hit rock bottom and tried to kill himself with an overdose of pills. But after confessing he was at his lowest ebb to sister Michelle Bailey, he sought help. He went to his childhood doctor and was told there had been advances in surgery and that hope could be in sight. After consulting a specialist at UCL, Mr Wardle was stunned and delighted when surgeons agreed to operate. He plans to write a book about his ordeal and train as a counsellor.","Andrew Wardle, 39, from Stalybridge, Greater Manchester, to have groundbreaking operation .

"Malia Obama has headed back into the classroom during her summer vacation as she and her mother spent Thursday afternoon visiting an all-girls middle school during their first day in Senegal. The First Family landed safely in Dakar on Wednesday evening and met with the Senegalese president and his wife on Thursday morning in the first leg of a highly-anticipated tour of Africa. The First Lady and her eldest daughter were greeted by an expectant crowd of young girls and they happily sat on stage alongside Senegalese First Lady Marieme Faye Sall as the students showed off their dancing skills during a brief performance.

First Ladies time together: After the initial meeting, Mrs Obama visited an all-girls school with the Senegalese First Lady Marieme Faye Sall . Back to school: Michelle was accompanied by Malia Obama when she spoke with the school principal Rouguy Ly Sall on Thursday . Social butterfly: In her first-ever Instagram, Mrs Obama posted a picture alongside some of the students saying that she was 'so inspired and so impressed by these extraordinary young women' The first family's visit to the middle school was not the only key connection it has to America as it was named in honor of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. Sasha is on the Africa trip but she did not go on the visit to the school. Instead, Malia had her cousin Leslie Robinson by her side. This isn't the first time that Leslie has been a welcome addition for Malia, as the two cousins were seated very close to one another at President Obama's second inauguration and were seen joking before the swearing in ceremony. Mrs Obama found the trip to the all-girls school as the perfect opportunity to launch her official Instagram account, and she has already posted three times since her visit. The first was a posed picture of she . and Malia and Leslie alongside the school principal and some of the . uniformed students. She indicated that she posted the photo herself by . signing off with her initials after writing that she was 'so inspired . and so impressed by these extraordinary young women'.

First Lady with a quote from her remarks at the school. 'You . all are role models for my daughters, which is why I brought them here . today - so that they could be inspired by you just like I am,' she told . the crowd. The students were given translated copies of Mrs Obama's remarks so that they could read along with her as she gave the speech from a podium. 'I know that some of you may be the first in your families to attend a school like Martin Luther King, so there might be people at home who don't quite understand what you're going through as you work to succeed here,' she said, explaining that she understood the sacrifices people make to put their children through school. She used the ailing health of South African leader Nelson Mandela as a way to drive her point home with the school children. 'If President Mandela could endure being confined to a tiny cell, being forced to perform back-breaking labor, being separated from the people he loved most in the world, then surely, all of us, we can keep showing up and doing our best- showing up for school each day, studying as hard as you possibly can,' Mrs Obama said. 'Surely, you can seize the kind of opportunities Mandela fought for for all of us; surely, you can honor his legacy by leaving a proud legacy of your own.'

"A man having sex with a goat, a lady groping her own breast and a naked woman sitting astride a Roman god. While it may sound like obscure pornography, it is actually art. A new exhibition in Italy featuring naked artists posing . as cavorting nymphs and satyrs leaves little to the imagination. Austrian artist Veronika Bayer standing next to a picture of her colleague Daniel Feyer superimposed on an erotic fresco at the Casoria Contemporary Art Museum (CAM) near Naples . The exhibition entitled ErotiCAM_Secret Room II, which is on display in the Contemporary Art Museum (CAM) in the town of Casoria near Naples, is based on images adapted from some of the . erotic frescoes (mural paintings) from Roman times. The audience are invited to leave comments on the works by either writing or drawing directly onto the pictures. 'There is nothing here that you would not see on Facebook or daytime television,' said Antonio Manfredi, the director of CAM, who also models for the exhibition. 'Even today when we talk about erotic works, it is difficult to show them. But as a politically incorrect museum, we thought that it was really interesting.' The exhibition was conceived by TEAM[:]niel, an Austrian artist collective comprising Claudia Feyer, Daniel Feyer and Veronika Bayer, who came up with idea of inserting photos of models onto photographs of the erotic frescoes from Pompeii and Herculaneum.

Model Caterina Flor Gumpel poses by a picture of herself superimposed on an erotic fresco. The audience are invited to leave comments on the works by either writing or drawing directly onto the pictures . The exhibition had initially been backed by the Italian Culture Ministry which gave the artists permission to photograph the ancient drawings. However it later withdrew its approval when it realised what their ultimate aims were. Artist Veronika Bayer from Austria, who features in a sexually graphic image, said: 'Since I regard myself to be a . strong woman, I said this is my picture, I want to make this, and I’m . proud of myself. 'It’s very aesthetic. It’s not cheap pornography, although . you see everything. But yes, it’s a kind of a statement for me.' Antonio Manfredi, director of CAM Museum, poses for photographers in front of a slideshow of the exhibition's pieces . Mimmo Femiano, an . Italian visitor to the museum, added: 'Pornography is abnormal, while eroticism, on the contrary, is art.' The museum said in a statement that the idea behind the exhibit was to 'transfer these works into the present.' This . isn't the first time that the CAM in Casoria has attracted controversy. In April last year it burned work from its collection in . protest against the government. The museum receives no public funds and survives on donations and ticket sales.

"When the treasures of Pompeii were unearthed in the 18th century, you might imagine that archaeologists would have been keen to show off their finds, which revolutionised modern understanding of the Roman world. But one part of the collection was hidden away for nearly 200 years - the erotic art which was a central part of everyday life as it adorned the houses of local citizens. And even now, the sexually explicit material with embarrassed its discoverers is kept in a so-called 'secret cabinet' separate from the rest of the material discovered in Pompeii and neighbouring Herculaneum. Warning: explicit content . Explicit: This statue of Pan having sex with a goat is one of the obscene statues in the 'Gabinetto Segreto' Graphic: Paintings from Pompeii like this caused huge embarrassment when they were discovered by archaeologists in the 18th and 19th centuries . The material exhibited in the Gabinetto Segreto in Naples is an extraordinary witness to the role that erotica played in the life of the Romans, as preserved by the eruption of Mt Vesuvius in 79 AD. Frescoes considered to be great works of art frequently contain depictions of naked men and women, while nude statues are also commonplace. Even more shocking from the modern point of view are phallic symbols which could be seen all around the cities, including penis-shaped oil lamps and wind chimes thought to bring good luck. Perhaps the best-known item in the Gabinetto Segreto is a statue of the god Pan having sex with a goat, which was featured in an exhibition on Pompeii in the British Museum earlier this year. Secret: The explicit artefacts were locked in a separate museum which was closed to women and the young . Commonplace: Nude statues and paintings were considered normal in ancient Rome, but later generations were scandalised by them . Pompeii was first excavated in the 1748, but it was not until the following century that the findings were catalogued and taken to museums. The extraordinary trove of erotica was a great embarrassment to scholars of the Victorian era, when public depictions of sex were entirely taboo. King Francis I visited the collection in 1819 - and he was so scandalised that he ordered the sexually explicit items to be locked away in a separate museum which could be accessed only by scholars. The material was described in a French catalogue which circulated around Europe, despite the best efforts of the authorities to suppress it, and attracted the attention of young aristocrats embarking on the 'Grand Tour'. Beautiful: But extraordinary works of art were condemned as obscene by 19th-century scholars . However, the offending objects were . bricked off from women and young people, while explicit frescoes could . only be glimpsed through metal shutters. It . was not until 2000 that the Gabinetto Segreto was fully opened to the . public - it now forms part of the Naples National Archaeological Museum. Naples . is not the only museum to have hosted a 'secret' collection of obscene . antiquities - the British Museum once held all sexually explicit items . in a 'Secretum' closed to the general public. Good luck: These clay objects were considered to bring fortune to their owners .","Erotic paintings and sculptures were part of everyday life in Pompeii .

"Bill Clinton and Mayor Michael Bloomberg have led the tributes for Ed Koch at his funeral today, remembering him as the quintessential New Yorker who breathed new life into the city he loved. Hundreds of mourners filled Manhattan's grand Temple Emanu-El to pay respects to the former New York mayor, who died of congestive heart failure on Friday at age 88. At the close of the service, Koch's casket was carried from the synagogue to a standing ovation from relatives, friends and politicians from across the political spectrum as 'New York, New York' played. President Clinton had cut short a trip to Japan to speak at the funeral. In a touching tribute, he described as Koch a great friend who had offered invaluable support to him and his wife, Hillary.

Clinton recounted Koch writing to him last year to inquire about Hillary's health, never saying that he too was ill. 'We're all doing fine but we all miss you,' Clinton said. 'And we miss you so much because we all know we're doing a lot better because you lived and served.' Mayor Bloomberg called Koch, who served from 1978 until 1989, 'our city's quintessential mayor'.

The city we know today would not have existed without him.' He concluded: 'Ed you did great, you really did great.' His nephews opened the service, by explaining: 'To you he was the mayor, the friend, . the movie reviewer, the voice of reason. To our children he was the . doting uncle Eddie. 'He encouraged us to be all we could be. He encouraged us to follow our dreams - after all it worked out pretty well for him. 'The city of New York was blessed to . have him as its mayor and because of you, he truly felt New York was the . best place in the world.' Mourners also heard about Koch's other . fierce loyalty - towards Israel. The Israeli consul general lauded Koch . for the support he had given the Jewish community. Among the mourners was City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, who said Koch frequently gave her advice, but 'at the end of . every conversation he would say, ""Just do what you want, and if people . don't like it, just bleep 'em"".' Former mayor Rudy Giuliani said Koch would be remembered for what he achieved in office and his boundless optimism. 'It's a sad day,' Mr. Giuliani told the . New York Times. 'Not too many people, if anyone, contributed more to New . York City than Ed Koch. It’s a life full of contributions and . achievement. He was so optimistic. We should feel guilty feeling too . sad.

Above all, he loved his country, the United States of America, in whose armed forces he served in World War II.' 'I don't want to leave Manhattan, . even when I'm gone,' Koch told The Associated Press in 2008 after . purchasing the burial plot in Trinity Church Cemetery. 'This is my home.

"A female anthropologist who spent six years working as a stripper while researching a book about strip clubs says she came to the conclusion that the establishments can actually help save marriages. Katherine Frank, who is based in Washington DC, interviewed 30 of her regular customers at the several strip clubs in which she workd to write G-Strings and Sympathy: Strip Club Regulars and Male Desire, a book about the relationship between strippers and their customers, which was adapted from her Ph.D. dissertation. She also debunked the myth that stripping leaves dancers and customers with unrealistic body image ideals, saying that the clubs proved to her that men have a far wider range of tastes when it comes to female bodies - far wider than women believe. Nonetheless, the academic says she still wouldn't want her husband visiting strip clubs regularly - because it's too expensive a hobby. Anthropologist Katherine Frank spent six years working as a stripper while researching a book about strip clubs, and says she came to the conclusion that the establishments can actually help save marriages . Speaking to Virginia Vitzthum on Salon, Frank explains how one of the chapters in her book - The Crowded Bedroom: Marriage, Monogamy, and Fantasy - she contradicts the popular belief that a man's ability to be intimate with his wife is eroded by such clubs, attesting that clubs in which she worked actually held together the marriages of many of the regulars she interviewed. Explaining that most of her interviewees were married, Frank said: 'For the men who . said that they were in love with their wives and wanted to stay married, . what happened in the clubs was transgressive and real enough to be . exciting, but was still a fantasy. 'In the chapter “The Crowded Bedroom,” I really wanted to question the whole idea of true intimacy. What does . that even mean?' That said, when asked whether or not she would mind her husband visiting the clubs regularly, Franks said she would - but mostly because of the money. She said: 'Honestly, . I wouldn’t like it! For me, a lot of it is about the money - I don’t . have the disposable income to spend on that kind of entertainment, and . if he did have that kind of extra money, I’d want it to be fair. 'Maybe if I could spend dollar for dollar somewhere else, but unfortunately, . there aren't yet places where women can go pay hot young men to stroke . their egos. That may come in the future.' Frank says she had 'really positive experiences' dancing, and learned that men have a 'much more varied perception of what sort of bodies are beautiful or sexy than a lost of women' Frank, who says she is a feminist, also became sympathetic toward her regulars at the clubs. She said: 'Talking to the guys in the strip clubs, I realized that they were damaged by the sexist culture, too. 'They felt repellent, that their wives and girlfriends could never accept their desires and that they could never ask advice about sex because they were supposed to somehow know everything. 'These guys were struggling with how to deal with what they saw as women’s conflicting demands for both traditional masculine traits and more emotional presence. 'They were also confused by women’s desire to be called beautiful but not be objectified.' Franks said: 'I had really positive experiences dancing. I learned that men have a much more varied perception of what sort of bodies are beautiful or sexy than a lot of women think they do' Frank also said stripping gave her more self-confidence and positively affected her attitude towards body image - mainly because she discovered that men have a much wider set of values for what constitutes a beautiful or sexy female body than women themselves do. She said: 'I had really positive experiences dancing. I learned that men have a much more varied perception of what sort of bodies are beautiful or sexy than a lot of women think they do. 'The upper-tier clubs had less variety than the lower-tier clubs. But even in the upscale clubs, you’ll see more variety of shapes and sizes than you’d see in a Cosmo or a Maxim. 'I had stereotyped men as wanting something narrow, when in fact they have a wide variety of tastes.'","Katherine Frank is based in Washington DC .

"‘Hi-ho, hi-ho, it’s off to work we go…Arrrrghhhh!’ That’s definitely not in the script of Disney classic Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs but it’s something that visitors to Disney World in Orlando are going to be hearing a lot of. For, after a lengthy hiatus, Magic Kingdom finally has a new roller coaster, the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, and MailOnline was one of the first to try it out. A runaway train ride, the steep drops and sharp bends are as terrifying as the Wicked Queen but considerably more fun, while inside, the walls are studded with more than a million ‘diamonds’ as well as a tableaux featuring Sleepy, Doc, Grumpy, Bashful, Sneezy, Happy and Dopey. Totally terrifying: Disney's Seven Dwarves Mine Train was so much fun, Travelmail had four goes . While the Mine Train is the big new attraction, Disney has been busy behind the scenes at its Florida resort and as a result, there’s plenty to be found in Florida that you won’t unearth in LA or Paris, including an extended Hollywood Studios theme park. Home to the Tower of Terror and the Aerosmith Rock n’ Roller Coaster, it might, on the face of it, be for children but that doesn’t mean the grown-ups can’t get involved. 100ft drops (the Tower of Terror), being shot forward at 90mph to the sound of Dude Looks Like A Lady (Rock n’ Rollercoaster) or shooting chipmunks in a mobile shooting gallery (Toy Story), there’s plenty to enjoy. Indeed, I loved the Rock n’Roller Coaster so much, I went on twice. But the resort isn’t all terrifying twists and hairpin bends. For those in search of something gentler, Magic Kingdom’s stable of child-friendly rides - the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train notwithstanding - makes it perfect for tiny tots. Hairpin bends: A ride on the Mine Train includes plenty of sharp bends and a seriously steep drop . Magical: Inside, the 'mine' has been kitted out with 'diamonds' and enthralling animated dwarves . Still around: The parade might have changed a little but classic characters such as Mickey and Donald remain . Enchanting: Fantasy Land, which includes the Cinderella Castle, boasts several new rides . Along with the pretty Main Street and the iconic Cinderella Castle, the newly revamped Fantasy Land is a small girl’s dream come true. Once you’ve finished getting your kicks on the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train (I managed a record four goes on this one), there’s a series of gentle new rides to enjoy, among them Under the Sea: The Journey of the Little Mermaid, which conveys you through Ariel’s watery kingdom in pink plastic clamshells with a glimpse of Ursula the only scary part. Then there’s the Winnie the Pooh ride which, if nothing else, should get younger readers clamouring for a copy of the AA Milne classic, and a traditional carousel complete with beautifully decorated prancing horses. Away from Fantasy Land, the Pirates of the Caribbean experience has also had a revamp (more Johnny Depp, much more!), while back on Main Street, Disney has launched a new parade to coincide with the unveiling of the new look Fantasy Land. Called the Festival of Fantasy Parade, it includes all of the old favourites – Mickey, Minnie, Goofy and Donald among them – as well as some eye-openingly clever new additions. I loved the 53ft long fire-breathing steampunk dragon that glared balefully at the children in the crowd as it sailed past, as well as Princess Merida of Brave fame’s vast set of mobile bagpipes. But while the new parade, Fantasy Land and the Seven Dwarves Mine Train have been gobbling up most of the headlines, I found myself enjoying some of the quieter spots such as the beautiful Boardwalk area and Animal Kingdom far more. The latter is the largest and least well-known of the four theme parks that make up Disney World, which, incidentally, covers an area larger than Greater Manchester. Here you’ll find the Kilimanjaro Safari, an experience that’s billed as seeing the animals as they really live but in reality is just as Disneyfied as everything else, and a petting area where you can get your hands on everything from ponies to chickens. Top attraction: Animal Kingdom's Expedition Everest rollercoaster is one of the best in the entire resort . Disneyfied: The Mount Kilimanjaro 'safari' experience is fun but can't hold a candle to the real deal . Much more exciting are the Kali River Rapids, a souped-up log flume that sends you spinning beneath waterfalls and zig-zagging through a series of rapids, and my favourite, Expedition Everest. With several seriously steep drops and a gorgeous view of the park from the top, as well as a stomach-churning section where you shoot backwards, Expedition Everest is as good as anything offered by Magic Kingdom. Indeed, so brilliant is Expedition Everest, I managed a record five goes. Fun though Expedition Everest is, it’s the Mine Train that’s likely to end up with the longest queues – much to the irritation of those who can’t bear waiting in line. Lucky then, that Disney has also launched a convenient new gadget called MyMagic Plus, a new wristband system that lets you book fast passes in advance and go shopping without having to carry a credit card around. Usefully for those of a more forgetful bent, it also contains your park tickets. I used mine for multiple goes on just about everything and spent approximately five minutes queuing at the Haunted Hotel – the attraction that, for some reason, had the biggest lines on the day I went. With no lines to worry about, it left me with much more time for whizzing about on the Mine Train and Big Thunder Mountain - an old favourite that I couldn’t resist revisiting for a second (and third) goes.

"It may have started as a humble circuit of rubber strips, but that wouldn't stop Scalextric becoming a thing of dreams. For generations, millions of children have routinely spread themselves onto the floor for hours on end to get the best track-side view of their miniature plastic cars in action. Now, 56 years later, the inventor's family has unveiled the first ever set - completely untouched. Historic: Diane Francis, widow of Scalextric inventor Freddie Francis, has unveiled the vintage set 56 years later . Nostalgia: Mr Francis modelled a blue Maserati and a green Ferrari to launch the set at Harrogate Toy Fair in 1957 . Freddie Francis launched the car racing kit at Harrogate Toy Fair in 1957. It was an instant hit with dealers, and a year later he sold the brand to Lines Bros. for mass production. But besotted by the toy, he put the first set ever made aside to one day pass on to his children or grandchildren. The previously unopened set has been preserved in a wooden box at the Francis family home. But when Mr Francis lay on his death bed in 1998, suffering from cancer, he told his wife Diane his dying wish was to hand the priceless plaything to their daughters, Caroline and Julia. The plastic and rubber circuit, with this rudimentary controller, was cutting-edge technology . The original manual is completely untouched. But Mr Francis vowed to give it to his children after he died . The kit comes complete with skid patch oil to maintain the track and car oil to apply to the miniatures . Finally, after fifteen years, and now with two grandchildren, Mrs Francis decided this Christmas was the time to unearth the vintage box from storage to give to Callum, four, and Luke, two. Mrs Francis, 68, from Birdham in West Sussex, said: 'My husband launched Scalextric in 1957 and kept one of the original boxes. 'It is one of the very first sets ever made and it has been kept in a wooden box which my husband built to safeguard it. 'After . we had our two daughters Catherine and Julia, Freddie came up with the . idea of giving them an original box set when they were older. Freddie Francis (front) is pictured cutting the grass at Minimodels Ltd where the first model was produced . The kits were an instant hit. Here, Formula One driver Stirling Moss is seen playing with his very own set . 'Freddie . sadly passed away from cancer in 1998 and it was his dying wish that . our daughters got this set - it was uppermost in his mind. 'I felt now was the right time to give my daughters the set. 'Julia and Catherine grew up playing with various Scalextric sets which they used to set up under the snooker table. 'Freddie wanted them to have it as something to remember him by. 'Opening the wooden box which contained the Scalextric set brought a lump to my throat. Family: Mr Francis, pictured with wife Diane (top left), and daughters Caroline and Julia, always had kits for the family over the years. He vowed to give them the precious original when he died aged 78 in 1998 . Love: Mr Francis attached a picture of him and his wife to his greatest invention . 'Scalextric is at the heart of our family and our daughters are very proud of their father. 'Now . they have children of their own who never got to meet their grandfather . but thanks to this Scalextric set his memory will live on.' Scalextric was born out of Freddie's company Minimodels which made tin plate toys and models. Among the firm's most popular products were its clockwork racing cars called Scalex - and when Freddie added an electric motor they became Scalex-electric or Scalextric. Grandsons Callum, four, and Luke, two, unwrapped the gift, now worth more than £1,500, this year . The toy fuelled fanatic interest in real-life cars as the manuals included information about the Grand Prix . Original sets came with pieces of interconnecting track made from rubber and two metal model racing cars. The cars chosen for the first sets were a Ferrari 375 and a Maserati 250F - driven by big name Grand Prix rivals like Stirling Moss, Juan Fangio and Alberto Ascari. The tracks and cars were built to a scale of 1:30 - and the cars were capable of a scale speed of 130mph. The speed of the cars was determined by handheld controllers and to make racing more fun the sets came with 'skid patch fluid' to create on-track hazards. A 1957 set cost five pounds, 17 shillings and six pence - the equivalent of 120 pounds in today's money. So sought after are original sets that the Francis family's unopened Scalextric track could now be worth upwards of £1,500.","Callum, 4, and Luke, 2, unwrap slot circuit kept in storage since 1957 .

"You may like to think that your partner imagines getting intimate with you and only you, but it would appear there are other things on his mind when it comes to sex. And they include threesomes, having sex with your friends, sleeping with their colleagues and being more adventurous in bed, according to a new survey by Cosmopolitan magazine. Some 50 per cent of engaged men secretly . wish they could have sex with a female friend, while 18 per cent of married . men would like to sleep with a colleague. The Cosmopolitan sex survey lifts the lid on what men are really thinking about when they're in bed . Just under a third (32 per cent) of men in a . relationship want to sleep with their a friend' girlfriend, and 32 per cent . of single men want to have sex with an ex. While most men surveyed have slept with just . one to three women, an energetic three per cent claim their 'number' is over 100 - but only half have had a one night stand. When asked if they . could change one thing about their sexual past, 36 per cent wish they'd slept . with more women and 32 per cent wish they'd been more adventurous. And when quizzed about infidelity, 42 per cent said they had cheated - and of those, 82 per cent said they felt guilty afterwards, and cited boredom as . their reason for being unfaithful. British men seem to like variety, too: 37 per cent boast having filmed themselves having sex, 72 per cent have had text sex, 28 per cent have tried S&M, and 23 per cent would be keen to try bondage. But a threesome is still the number one fantasy - over half the 732 men polled would be interested in introducing a third party to the bedroom. But a threesome is still the number one fantasy - over half the 732 men polled would be interested in introducing a third party to the bedroom . The survey also unearthed further secrets about men's sexual habits. Some 37 per cent of men who watch porn - 11 per cent of whom watch it every single day - feel the need to hide it from their partner. Some 26 per cent of men in a relationship have . enjoyed a private dance in a strip club, and 15 per cent have hooked up sexually . with someone they’ve met on Facebook. When it comes to their ideal woman, men say confidence is key, with 76 per cent saying they want a partner who knows what she's doing.

Louise Court, Editor of Cosmopolitan, said: 'British men are pretty hypocritical when it comes to sex. 'As a lot of the men we surveyed said they'd be put off if a girl had slept with between six and 20 men - while they wanted to sleep with loads of women. It takes two to tango. 'They love to see themselves as these Casanova figures having this fantasy world of sex. It's often not very realistic. 'It's very easy for men to reveal their innermost thoughts from the comfort of their armchairs, living in a lad culture with no consequences. 'But they need to separate fantasy from reality - a lot of women would like to have sex with David Beckham and have a wardrobe full of Louboutins but it doesn't mean it's going to happen.'

"Lord Lucan was smuggled out of Britain to a remote Greek monastery by a former MI5 agent financed by his wealthy friends, a new book has sensationally claimed. The nation's most wanted criminal was rescued by an exclusive group of Britain's richest socialites who enlisted a right-wing private army of former Government agents. In the week following the brutal murder of nanny Sandra Rivett in 1974, Lucan was moved around the country from a hotel to a pub and on to a ramshackle safe house. Lord Lucan escaped to a remote Greek monastery thanks to a shadowy cabal of ex-spies after his children's nanny was killed, claims a new book. Lady Lucan (right) is believed to have been the murder suspect's intended target . Solitude: The Monastery of Kapsa in Crete, where the aristocrat is said to have hidden out . The fugitive - hunted by the nation's police - shaved off his moustache, applied some fake tan and bleached his hair before boarding a flight from Heathrow with a fake passport provided by the former spy. The duo hid out in remote safe houses and fishing boats in Greece, before Lucan made it to the virtually inaccessible Cliffside monastery in Crete. After hiding out there for weeks, he disappeared on a boat to the shores of Africa under the guise of a monk, never to be seen again. The astonishing theory has been put forward by author Richard Wilmott who claims to have solved the 40-year mystery of what happened to the missing peer. Victim: Sandra Rivett, who was bludgeoned to death in the home of Lord Lucan's wife . He said his findings are the result of more than 20 years' research - during which his car containing some of his work was unaccountably torched. He claims his discoveries have been confirmed by a member of the Lucan family and says he only feels safe to reveal them now that key players in the plot have died. Mr Wilmott said: 'Everyone thought it was his wealthy chums that spirited him away but it is just not possible to simply disappear without a trace. 'Normal people, even those over-burdened with wealth, lack the ability to pull off such a trick. It takes the hands of professionals to disappear completely for 40 years. And that's what he had.' The writer says his story comes from a former MI5 agent known as James Gurney who claims he was the man responsible for escorting Lucan out of Britain. He said Gurney showed him his diaries to back up his extraordinary tale. Lucan was part of the Clermont Set, an exclusive group of Britain's richest gamblers and socialites who met at the Clermont Club in London's Mayfair. According to Gurney, they were the ones who enlisted a right-wing 'private army' known as the Troops of Midian to make Lucan disappear. They were a clandestine freelance outfit of former Government agents who carried out black ops work for MI5 and MI6 and even the CIA. Ms Rivett, 29, was bludgeoned to death in the basement kitchen of a four-storey house in Lower Belgrave Street, central London, in what police believed was a case of mistaken identity. Lord Lucan had lost a bitter custody battle with his wife Veronica. He had taken to spying on his estranged wife and his children, and lived just 100 yards away. Mr Wilmott says in the week following the murder Lucan was taken to the Wellington Hotel in Tunbridge Wells and then on to the Crown Inn, Groombridge, where he was handed over to Gurney. Detailed in diary entries from the time, he took him to a ramshackle safe house - once used by the intelligence agencies - in the tiny Wiltshire village of Fonthill Gifford. 'He was then spirited out of the country and this guy Gurney was with him all the way,' said Mr Wilmott. Hieaway: Mr Wilmott says in the week following the murder Lucan was taken to the Wellington Hotel in Tunbridge Wells . The Crown Inn in Groombridge, a village that straddles the border of Kent and East Sussex. Lucan was allegedly handed over to Gurney there . 'He was being paid by the Clermont Set to work for the Troops of Midian who were dangerous characters. 'They were in the business of taking people out if things go wrong. You didn't want to upset people like that. 'It was being bank-rolled by Lucan's chums, the Troops of Midian who were professionals involved purely on a cash basis, purely for the money.' Lucan shaved off his moustache, applied fake tan, bleached his hair and left the Wiltshire cottage carrying a fake passport in the name of Richard Bishop. Lucan reportedly Lucan shaved off his moustache, applied fake tan and bleached his hair to escape notice . He then simply strolled through Heathrow Airport with Gurney and boarded a plane to Athens. Gurney's diary said: 'It might have seemed lunacy that I was about to set out in broad daylight with the most wanted man in Britain beside me, but the police were looking for a lone man, with dark hair and a sandy speckled moustache. 'We were two fair, clean shaven men, travelling together.' Wilmott added: 'Lucan looked a lot older than the photographs put out, which were taken ten years before. 'He had become depressed and was no longer quite the dashing guy of all the photographs. He had lost his hair a little and was slightly podgier too, due to the drink. 'He had a fake passport - the Troops of Midian got him that - it was an easier thing to do.' Less than a fortnight after the murder and attempted murder of his wife Lucan, public enemy number one, was on a plane to Athens. In Greece Gurney said he met agents who helped him hide the fugitive in various safe houses and fishing boats before he ended at the remote Moni Kapsa monastery in Crete. Carved into the hill at the end of the Pervolakia Gorge and overlooking the Libyan Sea, it was virtually inaccessible - and a perfect hiding place. Wilmott, who visited the spot several times during his research, said: 'Lucan was left down there for the best part of a month. 'The monastery was a bit of a foreign legion. If life got too much for you, you could just go there and become a working monk. Lucan would fit in. You could quite easily disappear. 'As long as you pitched in with what needed doing, chores, picking beans, you were very welcome. 'I went to interview people at the local taverna and they remember this tall, thin man coming down and playing backgammon with the locals. 'They said he would walk the mountains and they called him ""the man that walked with the goats"".' A month after his arrival, Gurney met the tanned and much-fitter Lucan - the last time he ever saw him in the town of Irapetra. Lucan was part of the Clermont Set, an exclusive group of Britain's richest gamblers and socialites who met at the Clermont Club in London's Mayfair . He barely recognised the Lord and said in his diary that he looked ten years younger. He wrote: 'Lucan looked fit and healthy and was smiling as he greeted me with a strong handshake. 'Gone was the irritable and irritating snob with the military bearing and sulky behaviour. 'He could have been ten years younger and without a worry in the world.' Gurney waved goodbye to the earl an hour later and watched him leave on a small fishing boat probably destined to meet a bigger boat on the way to South Africa. Admitting he has no evidence to back it up, Wilmott reckons Lucan went to Botswana - playing the role of a monk from Moni Kapsa when necessary. He added: 'In Greece at the time, if you were connected to the monastery or religion, you were given pretty much free rein - you didn't even need a passport to travel.' Richard discovered that the monastery received an anonymous donation of several thousands of pounds in 1975 - shortly after Lucan's stay. It paid for much-needed repair work and a resident stipendiary priest. There are numerous theories about the fate of Lord Lucan. One is that he killed himself after being consumed with guilt . Richard put his theories to a member of Lucan's family - via a friend at the BBC - who let slip over a drink that his research was 'spot on'. The relative told his friend - who was interviewing him on a separate topic - that Lucan had died in 2004. 'After another couple of drinks the family member changed it to 2008, but on both times he said he died ""in sanctuary"", in a monastery or somewhere like that. 'The family member said that what information he had from us at the time was pretty much close to the truth.' Richard said he knew he was really onto something when his car was mysteriously firebombed in 1995 outside his home in Bourton, Dorset. All his notebooks and diaries that had been inside it were taken but Richard had kept copies. He added: 'I knew then I was really on to something and getting too close for certain people.' He was introduced to Gurney after a chance meeting in 1992 with an unnamed ex-lieutenant colonel and MI5 man who had started recording Gurney's story. The lieutenant colonel passed on Gurney's research - and his details - when he was recalled to the intelligence services. And although he met Gurney on a number of occasions - and corresponded via addresses in America and South Africa - Richard believes that was an alias and his real identity and whereabouts remain unknown. The Troops of Midian is available to buy via Amazon for £14.99 with £1 from every book going to Help For Heroes.","Aristocrat was moved between safehouses by ex-MI5 man, it is claimed .

"Pregnant women are often told they are at their most beautiful when they are expecting. And, of course, their bump is protecting very precious cargo. And now they can preserve the image of their bump for posterity as a pair of British bodycasters launch a company offering sculptures of baby bumps for women to keep forever. Sculptor couple CJ Munn and Andre Masters, both 40 from Maidstone in Kent, use special effects make-up to help make the bumps, and their intricate designs range from blue and white florals painted like china, to stone sculptures studded with mirrors or a more traditional bronze. The couple worked in television and film before they started creating the baby-bump casts as a hobby for friends. Scroll down for video . Two British bodycasters have discovered a way to record and decorate pregnancy bumps from traditional blue and white China to bronze statues . Sculptor couple CJ Munn and Andre Masters worked in television and film before they started creating the baby-bump casts as a hobby for friends and now make a whole range of designs . Speaking about the casts, which can be rendered in traditional plaster, more elaborate stone and even bronze, Andre said: 'We believe our belly casts are some of the most beautiful in existence in the world. 'Coming from such diverse creative backgrounds we work in so many different materials and we love being challenged to try new things. 'So what you'll see in our pictures is that every single belly cast we make is unique and utterly special to the owner of that piece. 'We love really personal requests where people will have us engrave or paint a piece with personal symbols or patterns - perhaps inspired by something to do with their home or family heritage. Before and after: The two bodycasters used to work in TV and used special effects make-up to create the casts . They did the very first bump cast for one of their friends and then everyone wanted one, so the business snowballed from there . The casting session takes up to 60 minutes but it's only after 14 weeks for a stonecast piece to be fabricated and five months for bronze works to be completed . 'We'll go to the ends of the earth to search out new techniques or materials to work with to satisfy our clients. 'We love what we do and we think that level of care shows in our work.' The casting session takes between 30 to 60 minutes to complete. However, it takes 14 weeks for a stonecast piece to be fabricated and five months for bronze works to be completed. Andre's partner, CJ explained how the pair turned these belly-casts into a business. Bodycaster couple, Andre Masters, left, and CJ Munn, right, turned their hobby into a business . 'Bellycasts are a bit like Marmite and people either love them or hate them,' she said. 'We did the very first bump cast together and then all my pregnant friends wanted one, and all their pregnant friends wanted one, and it snowballed from there.' This progressed into learning how to do all the different body parts. 'I love hearing everyone's stories, and then welcoming the clients back later to collect their bumps and sometimes cast the new babies. 'Clients often come back and back . with new siblings and other family members, so it's really wonderful . seeing families grow and change over the years. 'We love to make the casts as personal and individual as possible. Some people even have us engrave poems or song lyrics into them. 'Nothing is too wacky or wild a request, and the only limits are budget and imagination.' Clients often return to the couple's studio with new siblings and other family members to get theirs done . Speaking about the casts, which are made from traditional plaster casts to more elaborate stone and even bronze, Andre said: 'We believe our belly casts are some of the most beautiful in existence in the world'","Bodycasters CJ Munn and Andre Masters, 40, from Kent, make the designs .

"It was a brave move by an ailing high street fashion retailer to restore its fortunes and entice more customers. But French Connection's new advertising campaign showing naked models has spectacularly backfired, with shoppers branding the raunchy images 'offensive' and 'unnecessary.' Prudish passers-by got more than they bargained for as they walked past the windows of the chain's stores when they copped an eyeful of top-naked models. The posters of topless models with strategically placed ink drawings to cover their nudity below the waist have adorned the windows of the brands stores nationwide. In Manchester the racy photographs drew gasps from innocent bystanders and some shocked shoppers called for more 'window-dressing'. The black and white images show models completely naked from the waist up with ink sketches of clothes covering their bottom half. They are part of the retailer's From Sketch To Store campaign and have attracted controversy, with five complaints being issued to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) since the campaign was launched. It is understood that complainants to the advertising industry watchdog referred not only to the 'offensive' nature of the nudity, but also to the fact that the models appeared to some viewers to be 'unhealthily thin'. A display at Manchester's flagship French Connection store in St Ann's Square includes an electronic billboard, which revolves to . display two images of models naked from the waist up. Three separate . images rotate and are on display for a matter of seconds each. The . first image captures a model, posing naked from the waist up, next to . the advertising campaign's slogan - From Sketch To Store. The second image shows two models, with one topless and the other fully clothed. The third image is of two fully clothed models. Model pose: The posters are accompanied by fully-clothed mannequins at Manchester's flagship store in St Ann's Square . Pat Hobson, 54, from Bury, Greater Manchester, spotted the display. She said: 'I was shocked to see it and at first and I thought the woman had a T-shirt on until I looked closer. 'I think it is unnecessary on a busy street where there are lots of children.' Another concerned shopper from Rusholme penned an official complaint to her local councillor, Rabnawaz Akbar. It read: 'I would like to complain about the shop window display in the French Connection shop in town. It is offensive, it appears to be a topless woman.' But Manchester City Council bosses said it was not their job to police a store's advertising campaign and it was 'all a matter of individual taste.' Councillor Pat Karney said: 'It's not a priority for the council to police shop fronts in Manchester. These are all matters of public taste and reaction. 'French Connection is a very reputable company but has a reputation for edgy marketing. ' The councillor admitted that this was the first time he had seen 'this kind of adult presentation in a shop window', but added: 'These matters always divide public opinion and if people have an issue with the advert, they should complain directly to the store.' During the campaign launch, French Connection bosses claimed the pictures for the Autumn/Winter 2013 campaign, taken by renowned fashion photographer John Rankin Waddell, had been praised in some spheres. Complaints: People were not only shocked by the topless models but also by the fact that they seemed 'unnaturally thin' The photographer, known professionally as Rankin, has shot celebrities including Daniel Craig and Kevin Spacey and worked on many major advertising campaigners including a recent project to promote Oral-B toothpaste with This Morning presenter Holly Willoughby. Rankin said: 'I've always admired the brand for striving to push boundaries, and for their fearless approach to captivating campaign concepts.' A spokesman for French Connection said it was not the store's policy to comment on complaints about advertising campaigns. However, during the campaign launch bosses said: 'At French Connection, we don't follow trends, we make them. 'The campaign - our first shoot in black and white - maintains French Connection's irreverent sense of humour, which our customers have come to love and adore.' Promotional material stated that the campaign was shot over two days with two female models and one male model 'having fun' in Rankin's London studio as he photographed them naked. Reputation: French Connection bosses said the company was proud of its edgy image . Illustrator Jo Bird then used inks to draw clothing design sketches over the large scale prints. French Connection marketing director Jennifer Roebuck claimed that the campaign 'brings out the fearless nature of the brand and our design credibility but with a twist'. She added: 'When you look back at the iconic FCUK campaigns you can also see the fearless attitude and that is part of the brand and our design philosophy.' In March this year it was revealed that the fashion retailer had slumped into the red after a dire year during which its young customers had flocked to more relevant designs elsewhere. The firm, which has taken the £1.3million hit by shutting stores in a bid to cut costs, posted four profit warnings during the 18 months leading up to March. It said total sales were down 8 per cent to £197.3million for the year ended January 31 - down 7.4 per cent on an underlying basis. It also posted a £7.2million loss before tax, a fall from the £4.6million profit seen the previous year.","Revolving billboards in St Ann's Square show topless men and women .

"More airplane passengers than ever are trying to get through airport security while carrying firearms. Luckily, the Transportation Security Administration has recently started an Instagram feed to document such illicit carry-ons. The TSA set a record in May for the most guns seized in one week - 65 in all, 45 of them loaded and 15 with bullets in the chamber and ready to be fired. In June, the agency began adding photos to an Instagram photo feed and, surprise, they are mostly of firearms. What gun? In a year when more passengers than ever are being caught carrying guns onto planes, the TSA has started posting such confiscated items on an Instagram feed . In the first six months of this year, TSA screeners found 894 guns on passengers or in their carry-on bags, a 30 percent increase over the same period last year. Several times every day, at airports across the country, passengers are trying to walk through security with loaded guns in their carry-on bags, purses or pockets, even in a boot. And, more than a decade after 9/11 raised consciousness about airline security, it's happening a lot more often. Last year TSA found 1,549 firearms on passengers attempting to go through screening, up 17 percent from the year before. Oh, that gun: A record 65 guns were confiscated by TSA officials from passengers attempting to board planes. The most common excuse was 'I forgot it was there' In response to a request from The Associated Press, the agency provided figures on the number of firearm incidents in 2011 and 2012 for all U.S. airports, as well as the number of passengers screened at each airport. The AP analyzed the data, as well as weekly blog reports from the agency on intercepted guns from this year and last year. TSA didn't keep statistics on guns intercepted before 2011, but officials have noticed an upward trend in recent years, said spokesman David Castelveter. Some of the details make officials shake their heads. But in the Instagram account, the . agency has found away to show the public the extent of the problem while . educating them as to what they can, and cannot, bring aboard an . aircraft. It was only . opened in June, but TSA photos on the social image sharing site already . includes several shots of pistols, a grenade, a stun gun disguised as a . cigarette box, among other dangerous weapons. That's not my grenade: The Instagram feed, opened in June, shows other prohibited weapons, too, like these menacing blades and concussion grenade . Told you it wasn't a gun: This urban camouflage contraction may look like a gun, but its actually an ingeniously disguised switchblade . ‘We don't analyze the behavioral traits of people who carry weapons. We're looking for terrorists,’ Castelveter said. ‘But sometimes you have to scratch your head and say, `Why?'‘ . One screaming example of ‘Why!?’ might . be found in a Sacramento, California passenger who, last year, was . sauntering through security when TSA officers noticed he was wearing a . shoulder holster, and in it was a loaded 9 mm pistol. The same passenger . was found to have three more loaded pistols, 192 rounds of ammunition, . two magazines and three knives. You're in taser country: This is a stun gun disguised as a pack of Marlboro cigarettes posted to the TSA Instagram feed. Notice the extra 'L' Screeners elsewhere found a .45-caliber pistol and magazine hidden inside a cassette deck. Another .45-caliber pistol loaded with seven rounds, including a round in the chamber, was hidden under the lining of a carry-on bag in Charlotte, N.C. A passenger in Allentown, Pa., was carrying a pistol designed to look like a writing pen. At first the passenger said it was just a pen, but later acknowledged it was a gun, according to TSA. A passenger in March at Bradley Hartford International Airport in Connecticut had a loaded .38-caliber pistol containing eight rounds strapped to his lower left leg. At Salt Lake City International Airport, a gun was found inside a passenger's boot strapped to a prosthetic leg. TSA doesn't believe these gun-toting passengers are terrorists, but the agency can't explain why so many passengers try to board planes with guns, either, Castelveter said. The most common excuse offered by passengers is ‘I forgot it was there.’ Many passengers found to have guns by screeners are arrested, but not all. It depends on the gun laws where the airport is located. If the state or jurisdiction where the airport is located has tolerant gun laws, TSA screeners will frequently hand the gun back to the passenger and recommend locking it in a car or finding some other safe place for it. The government doesn't track what happens to the people who are arrested. Is it plausible that some people are so . used to carrying guns that they simply forget that they have them, even . when they're at an airport about to walk through a scanner? Or do some . people try to bring their guns with them when they fly because they . think they won't get caught? Lone Star state of mind: Five of the 12 airports with the most gun confiscations last year were in the state of Texas . Dropping trou': This blade was disguised as a belt buckle according to the official TSA Tumblr account . Jimmy Taylor, a sociology professor at Ohio University-Zanesville and the author of several books on the nation's gun culture, said some gun owners are so used to carrying concealed weapons that it's no different to them than carrying keys or a wallet. The most common reason people say they carry guns is for protection, so it also makes sense that most of the guns intercepted by TSA are loaded, Taylor said. Many gun owners keep their weapons loaded so they're ready if needed, he said. Even so, Taylor said he finds it hard to believe airline passengers forget they're carrying guns. ‘My wife and I check on things like eye drops and Chapstick to see if we're allowed to take them on a plane, so it's a little difficult to imagine that you aren't checking the policies about your loaded firearm before you get to the airport,’ he said. Occasionally passengers stopped by . TSA are people who are used to carrying guns because they work in law . enforcement, security or the military, but that doesn't appear to be the . case most of the time. Robert . Spitzer, an expert on gun policy and gun rights, theorizes that for . some, the ‘I forgot’ answer is an excuse, ‘just like somebody who walks . out of a store with an unpaid-for item in their pocket. The first thing . that person will say is, `I forgot.' Do people forget sometimes? Sure . they do. But are there also people who try to shoplift to get away with . something? Sure there are, and I think that's no less true with guns.’ Eighty-five percent of the guns intercepted last year were loaded. The most common type of gun was a .38-caliber pistol. Airports . in the South and the West, where the American gun culture is strongest, . had the greatest number of guns intercepted, according to TSA data. Sneaky: Items like this credit card knife are common finds in airport security lines . Of the 12 airports with the most guns last year, five are in Texas: Dallas-Fort Worth International, 80 guns; George Bush Intercontinental in Houston, 52; Dallas Love Field, 37; William P. Hobby in Houston, 35, and Austin-Bergstrom International, 33. Hartsfield-Jackson in Atlanta had the most for any airport, at 96. Others include Phoenix Sky Harbor, 54; Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International in Florida, 42; Denver International, 39; Seattle-Tacoma International, 37; Orlando International Airport in Florida, 36, and Tampa International in Florida, 33. By contrast, at John F. Kennedy . International Airport in New York, where TSA screened nearly 27 million . passengers last year, there was a single passenger found to have a gun. ‘There . are some Americans who believe that there are no limits, that they not . only have a constitutional but a God-given right to have a gun and `By . gosh, if I want to bring a gun on a plane I'm going to do it,'‘ said . Spitzer, a professor at the State University of New York-Cortland. Too common: TSA officials say people try to get through security with guns, like the one in this handout, everyday and its occurring more and more often. In the first 6 months of 2013, 894 guns were confiscated . TSA's count of guns intercepted doesn't include all the other kinds of prohibited ‘guns’ that TSA screeners find. Last December, screeners stopped a passenger in Boston with seven stun guns in his bag. He said they were Christmas presents. The same week, screeners spotted 26 stun guns in the carry-on bag of a passenger at JFK. TSA has found several stun guns disguised as smartphones, and one that looked like a package of cigarettes. Passengers are allowed to take guns with them when they fly, but only as checked baggage. They are required to fill out a form declaring the weapons and to carry them in a hard-sided bag with a lock. Festive: Fireworks, a no-no on passenger planes, are also commonly found. Why one passenger also happened to have brass knuckles (bottom right) remains a mystery . Most of those who are stopped with guns are reluctant to talk about it afterward. One who didn't mind was Raymond Whitehead, 53, of Santa Fe, N.M., who was arrested at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey in May after screeners spotted 10 hollow-point bullets in his carry-on bag. Whitehead, who is completely blind, also had a .38 caliber Charter Arms revolver in his checked bag that he had failed to declare. He said in an interview with the AP that he was unaware of the specifics of the rules for checking guns, or that hollow-point bullets are illegal in New Jersey. Whitehead acknowledged that it seems ‘counterintuitive’ for a blind man to have a gun but said he keeps a loaded gun handy for protection from intruders. In such a situation, he said, he would call out a warning that he had a gun and spray bullets in the direction of the noise if the intruder didn't leave. ‘I have five shots, and if I fan it out I'm going to hit you,’ said Whitehead, a National Rifle Association member who owns five guns.","A record 65 guns were seized from airport passengers in one week last May .

"Former presidential hopeful Mitt Romney is to break his silence in his first interview since his failed election bid.

"A ban on nudists getting undressed on one of Britain's most famous beaches has been lifted by the Queen's estate. Officials told naturists they must cover up on the sands at Holkham, north Norfolk, after complaints that it had become 'a haven for swingers and perverts'. The beauty spot featured in Shakespeare in Love and was the setting for the final scene of the Oscar winning film where Gwyneth Paltrow walks along the beach after surviving a shipwreck.Scroll down for video .

'We are confident that by following best practice any remaining problems can be resolved. We hope that it is all behind us now.' He . added: 'A lot of naturists were extremely angry and upset when the ban . was put in place but there is no reason why it should happen again. 'That part of the beach has been used by naturists for as long as anyone can remember and we are working very hard to ensure it stays that way.' The ban on nudism in the dunes, which are owned and managed by Holkham Estate, and on all land above mean high water, will still be enforced. The beach and dunes form part of the Holkham National Nature Reserve which is also managed by the Holkham Estate. The . ban came after a Facebook campaign was launched in the summer of 2010 . to crackdown on sex pests roaming the sands. Locals have complained . about people having sex in public and propositioning beach-goers. One campaigner wrote in August 2010: 'My last three visits to the beach have seen me propositioned twice. 'I've . witnessed gay sex in the sand dunes and men walking around ""playing"". I've reported this to the wardens and local PCSO but nothing has been . done. 'The beach used to be a lovely place to go but now it's just a haven for swingers and perverts who won't take no for an answer.' Partial lifting: The ban on nudism in the dunes, which are owned and managed by Holkham Estate, and on all land above mean high water, will still be enforced . David Horton-Fawkes, estates director at the Holkham Estate, said: 'We are aware that the Crown Estate has reversed its decision about nudism on the beach following the threat of judicial review by a small group of naturists. 'Until now the ban on nudism had stopped the illegal activity that has plagued the beach. 'We can only hope that this decision does not re-open the door to those who have ruined this part of the Nature Reserve for the vast majority of beach users.' He added: 'The ban on nudism on Estate land remains in place because we believe it is important to safeguard our staff and visitors. 'Our team will continue to work closely with the Crown Estate, the police and Natural England to uphold the interests of the majority of people who visit the beach.' The Queen's Household Cavalry take their horses to swim in the sea at Holkham every summer. A Facebook group was set up three years ago trying to ban naturists from Holkham Beach . A boat on Holkham beach . Holkham beach, which is part of Holkham National Nature Reserve, attracts about 500,000 visitors a year. It was the setting of the final scene in the Oscar-winning film Shakespeare In Love. The film ends with Gwyneth Paltrow walking along the sand. Natural England has described it as one of the most important and heavily  visited sites in the UK. The beach is backed by a pine forest and is renowned for being one of the best stretches of unspoiled coastline in the UK. It regularly makes the list of the most recommended naturist beaches. The stretch of sand has also played host to a Royal holiday. In 1957, the Queen, Prince Philip and a young Princess Anne and Prince Charles spent time on the beach. The conservation area is also a favourite among twitchers as a variety of birds graze along the salt marshes. The beach, which features about three miles of unspoiled sand, is largely man-made. It was reclaimed from the sea in the 19th Century by the 2nd Earl of Leicester, who planted pine trees to stabilise the sand.","Crown estate which owns the beach at Holkham imposed ban this summer .

"Twin sisters believed to be Amsterdam's oldest prostitutes have retired after more than 50 years each in the sex trade. Louise and Martine Fokkens, 70, have finally decided they are too old for the business after claiming to have slept with 355,000 men between them in a combined 100-year career. Louise, a mother of four, has said her arthritis now makes some sexual positions 'too painful'. Scroll down for video . Ladies in red: The twins, who usually dress in matching clothing, became prostitutes at the age of 20 . Game changer: After 50 years selling sex, Louise and Martine Fokkens are giving up prostitution . And mother-of-three Martine admits she is finding it hard to attract new punters - except one elderly man who still comes for his weekly sado-maschism session. She said: 'I couldn't give him up. He's been coming to me for so long it's like going to church on a Sunday.' The pair were the subject of a documentary film last year called Meet the Fokkens, and have now written a book about their combined 100-years of sexual exploits called The Ladies of Amsterdam. Both women - who usually dress in identical red clothes - became prostitutes before the age of 20 to survive financially after escaping violent relationships. They now look back on the 'golden . years' of the profession before the Netherlands legalised prostitution . and the sex trade was invaded by 'eastern European mafia'. Louise said: 'It is very different now. We used to sit in the windows with clothes on. Today they are totally naked. 'There are few Dutch women and no sense of community these days.' Martine added: 'The legalisation of brothels in 2000 has not improved prostitutes' lives. Double act: Louise said she was forced to retire after arthritis made some sexual positions 'too painful' Laid bare: The twins are hoping to survive from the book and films rights to the documentary about their lives called Meet the Fokkens . 'There is no point working just for tax. That is why the girls are working from the internet and from home - you are less likely to be spotted by the taxman. 'It is better for the pimps and the foreigners, but not for the Dutch girls.' Martine and Louise said they now hoped to be able to live off their earnings from the book and film rights. Not what it used to be: Louise and Martine say there is no longer 'a sense of community' among Amsterdam's prostitutes .

"Oscar Pistorius is selling up property and shares in his race horses in a bid to pay his spiralling legal costs. A close friend of the athlete said he is selling off 'all his property and everything' as he tries to raise money to fight the charges of murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, 29. He has already racked up a £200,000 legal bill and his selling shares in one of his race horses, Tiger Canyon, and trying to sell other property. Oscar Pistorius is fighting charges that he murdered girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine's Day . Friends of the athlete, pictured in court, say he is selling shares in a race horse to pay for spiralling legal costs . His friend Mike Azzi, who Pistorius . calls Uncle Mike, was quoted in the Sunday People as saying: 'We spoke . about one or two of the horses. He's asked me to try to get people to . buy them for him because he has no form of income any longer. 'He's selling off all his property and everything because of the legal costs.' A new BBC documentary Oscar Pistorius: What Really Happened has also made a number of other claims. One of the revelations made in the programme is that when the 26-year-old athlete was arrested he told police: 'I'll survive. I always win', reports the Sunday People. He was replying to a senior officer who told him: 'You could go to jail for a very long time, Oscar.' Pistorius was released on strict bail conditions two weeks ago. He was ordered to pay a bond of £73,000 and forbidden from returning to his house, the scene of the crime. The Olympic and Paralympic star's lucrative sponsorship deals were suspended after his arrest . His legal costs are mounting and once the trial begins they will soar further. Pistorius' lucrative sponsorship deals with the likes of Nike and Oakley have been suspended, ending one of his income streams. There are also concerns the Olympic and Paralympic star may be suicidal. Mr Azzi, a race horse trainer, said Pistorius is a 'broken man' who is on the verge of killing himself. The family friend said Pistorius is praying for Steenkamp and her family and asks his friends to do so as well. Police have confirmed that a witness who lives 150 metres from Pistorius' home in the Silver Woods estate in Pretoria has come forward. They claim to have heard screams and shots on the night Steenkamp died. Police said the door to the bathroom, pictured, that Steenkamp was shot through opened inwards meaning she may have used her body to stop it being opened . Oscar Pistorius at his home in Pretoria with his dogs Enzo and Silo. Investigators have confirmed two dogs were at the house when Reeva Steenkamp died . Pistorius says he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder when he shot her through a locked bathroom door. Police have now revealed that the door opens inwards and are investigating the possibility she was using her body to stop the athlete from coming in when she died. They are also working their way through the 'massive' number of texts on Steenkamp's mobile phone and are continuing to examine the 9mm pistol used and Pistorius' phone. Investigators have also confirmed that two dogs were at the property at the time.

"It was certainly a wild way to raise money - animal lovers flashed for cash. Hundreds of fundraisers earned their stripes by running naked around a zoo to raise money for a rare subspecies of tiger. The sponsored streak saw 300 brave runners get back to nature by stripping off to make their way through ZSL London Zoo in the after-hours event, watched by their supporters and some rather confused animals. Out in the open! Sponsored runners take part in a naked charity streak to raise money for endangered Sumatran tigers . A rare pair: The event happened at ZSL London Zoo to raise money for conservation work . Streak for Tigers, named after the collective noun for the animal, raised some £60,000 . Wearing nothing more than shoes, tiger masks and tiger ears, they ran a 300m course through the centre of the attraction, with some exhibitionists choosing to complete several laps of the circuit. Body paint and tiger stripe leg warmers were the streakers' only attempts at modesty. Streak for Tigers, named after the collective noun for the animal, raised some £60,000 which will be ploughed into conservation work to protect the Sumatran tigers, of which only 300 remain in the wild. Brave participant Nic Coles, 34, from Biggin Hill, Kent, said it was 'a great event'. With only 300 Sumatran Tigers left in the wild, the event was to raise funds and also highlight the work that needs to be done in order to save the tiger . Wearing nothing more than trainers, tiger masks and tiger ears, they ran a 300m course through the attraction . Body paint and tiger stripe leg warmers were the streakers' only attempts at modesty . 'I was a bit nervous at first, but after seeing so many people turning out for it, it made it feel a lot easier.' he said. 'If it helps the tigers, I'd do it all over again.' Only 300 known Sumatran Tigers remain in the wild. Jae Jae is London Zoo's male Sumatran tiger . Fellow streaker Son Osman, 31, from Bromley, south east London, said he had 'jumped at the chance' to take part in the run. Explaining why, he said: 'It was the chance to get naked in a zoo, for the tigers. It was very liberating, and quite a unique experience.' James Wren, development director at ZSL, said: 'Everyone got so excited about the event, they really got behind it. 'There was an amazing buzz in the crowd, both from the spectators and the participants who were running around naked. 'We only asked them to do one lap, but many carried on doing several laps around the zoo because they felt so liberated and free. 'The feedback has been overwhelming, from those involved in naturism to those who are just passionate about tigers. 'They were apprehensive and nervous, but when they were doing it, they just enjoyed it so much, they were delighted.'","Sponsored streak saw 300 brave runners bolt around ZSL London Zoo .

"Passion: Mother-of-three Claire Smith has re-discovered the joy of sex . Four times a week. If I told you I’m a 43-year-old mother of three children under ten and that’s how many times I make love to my husband (and no, I don’t mean begrudgingly), would you believe me? Heck, as little as six months ago I’d have rolled my eyes in disbelief, too. Well, it’s true: I have stumbled upon a little-known fact. And like any good evangelist, I’m keen to spread the word. Speak to any mother of young children and she’ll undoubtedly tell you that intimacy with her husband is not on her list of priorities. Not for nothing does one of my friends call it the ‘last job of the day’. I used to be like this. I could eke out our sexual droughts for months, but my hubby Ken, 45, would eventually get snappy and I’d have to give in. But the truth I’ve discovered is that having children eventually makes your sex life even better. I’d go so far as to say that with a bit of work it can trigger a second honeymoon. It’s like having sex at your parents’ house; the furtiveness makes it all the more thrilling, and those thrills bring you closer together. In many ways, our sex life is better now than when we first met. We know each other better, we’re more experienced and our love life has been transformed. I met Ken at a wedding when I was 29 and he was 31. As clichéd as it might sound, it was love at first sight. The trouble was he lived in Cambridge and I worked at a music management company in London, so we could see each other only at weekends. The passion was palpable every time we were reunited. It wasn’t long before we moved in together in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, and by the time we married in September 2002, we’d spoken about having children, which was a good thing because I conceived on our wedding night. But I didn’t find pregnancy easy. My skin erupted and I piled on three stone. For the first time in my life, I’d look in the mirror and recoil. And it’s true what they say about the link between a woman’s self-confidence and her libido. But Ken was as frisky as ever. He’d be all hands when I was vacuuming. Instead of feeling flattered, I’d swat him away. Of course, things only worsened after our son Charlie was born. I had an emergency Caesarean. Not only did I feel violated by the experience, it left me with angry scars across my tummy. Then came the soul-drenching exhaustion of motherhood. Ken worked long hours at an environment consultancy, so that meant the vast majority of parenting and chores were left to me. I went from being a bouncy, flirty thing to an anxious, snappy creature who lived in a far from fetching T-shirt and tracksuit. However, Ken started getting amorous less than three months after the birth. When met by my distinctly cold shoulder, he’d say: ‘Have you gone off me?’ I finally acquiesced after four months, with great reluctance. I just felt so unattractive and tired. Sex four times a week: Claire and her beloved husband . From then on, I’d try to leave it as long as possible, but I’d always give in eventually — usually in the missionary position and mainly because I didn’t want his needs being met elsewhere. After having children, a woman’s needs become things such as her husband unloading the dishwasher or holding the baby. But a man’s remain of the carnal variety. Despite all of the above, I soon decided I wanted another baby. Our daughter Lyra was born in March 2005. Sex was the first thing to go again. And again, it only reappeared on my agenda when I decided on a third child. Ken was pleased we were active in the bedroom once more, but after our son Miller was born in November 2008 I really struggled with sex and my self-image. After a year of juggling three young children on my own, I found myself sobbing my heart out to my GP, who prescribed me anti-depressants. At last, Ken could see my froideur wasn’t down to him. On one occasion, he even confessed he’d feared I was having an affair. Baby boom . Every day 120 million acts of sexual intercourse take place around the world — resulting in 910,000 conceptions . Now that he understood and supported me I could piece myself back together. Within a year I was off the medication. By that time, I’d built up a group of mummy friends and our main topic of conversation was how a house full of children left us doing all we could to avoid sex. But I knew my lovely husband deserved more. I wanted to satisfy him, but my confidence had been so shaken. Could anything bring the fizz back? After months of internal debate I took action. Oddly enough, the trigger was a petty, domestic row. I stormed off with the joint credit card, determined to cheer myself up with some retail therapy. It was then that a lingerie store caught my eye — and I realised I’d been wearing the same greying maternity bras for four years. What had I become? Flirtation had always been a part of my character. Now, a row was as near as we had got to passion in months. I found myself in the changing room trying on an exorbitantly expensive hot pink bra and knickers. I thought: ‘I look all right!’ My breasts had changed and my hips were wider, but I’d lost my pregnancy weight. I bought the undies and walked out of the shop with a spring in my step. I was about to re-ignite a long-dormant spark. Imitating art: Claire and her husband once tried to copy a Desperate Housewives plot by having sex every day for a week . The next week, when I confessed to my girlfriends that I’d decided to make the earth move again, they advised me to try waxing. The next day I had a Brazilian and it made me feel brilliant. And so, that night, while Ken was putting the children to bed, I changed into my new undies and slipped into bed. Instigating sex for the first time in years was such a turn-on. When he saw me in bed, Ken’s mouth dropped open. It was the best sex we’d had in years. It felt like those early days when all that mattered was us. My libido had been kick-started. Seeing how happy it had made us, I came up with a plan inspired by Desperate Housewives. I decided we should try to have sex every day for a week. And while we managed only three nights — exhaustion, TV and a tummy bug got in the way — we had fun trying. I realised what I’d been missing: how making love unites a couple. The next morning we were far more demonstrative in our affections. Sex is like going to the gym: you might not fancy it to start with, but once you make the effort, you get addicted. It became a naughty secret between us — we’d send each other sexy texts during the day and gaze at each other over dinner. I suddenly remembered what I’d found so attractive about my husband. It felt so daring: adults frolicking in the same house as the children! Before we had children, the fact sex was on tap made us complacent. Today, Ken is beaming and I’ve adopted a bit of a wiggle. The effect on my confidence is such that I even bought a racy basque the other day — something I would never have dreamed of in my 20s. To all those who read this thinking ‘if only!’, I’d stress that if I can do it — after three children and ten years of non-existent libido — anyone can. And believe me, you’ll want to shout about it, too.","Claire Smith, 43, rediscovered joy of sex after ten years of non-existent libido .

"The seedy world of online stripping has been unveiled in a tell-all expose penned by one such former 'cam-girl' who used to strip and masturbate for male viewers - whose credit cards were then charged by the minute. The former Skype sex worker blogged her account of internet stripping on Refinery29 under the name Abigail Fox, explaining how she entered the industry after seeing an advert for the job on Craigslist while living in Los Angeles in 2009. The classified spoke of how girls made 'up to $500 a day' (£311) entertaining men from the safety of a local studio using just a laptop with a built-in camera, and promised 'no hands-on'. It sounded easy, she thought. Writing on Refinery29, Abigail Fox says her first client was a man named John who just wanted to talk for three hours, leaving her $270 richer . Abigail says: 'My first client was a guy named John who just wanted to talk. For three hours. When we finished, I was $270 (£168) richer, and he felt like he knew me. 'Those clients seemed like such a cliché: The lonely guys who were looking for a pretend girlfriend for a couple of hours.' Usually, all she saw of the man were typed words on a screen. But sometimes continues a client had a camera and asked if she'd like to see them: 'In cam-world, I was always very enthusiastic. 'I just loved taking off my clothes and sucking on my fingers. I loved talking to them about their fantasies, and I loved seeing them masturbate through grainy cameras trained on laps sitting in swivel computer chairs. 'It was the most customer service-oriented job I'd ever had: I had to be engaged, teasing, and friendly, while still managing to take down the guys who were just there to waste my time or get a freebie.' 'It was the most customer service-oriented job I'd ever had: I had to be engaged, teasing, and friendly, while still managing to take down the guys who were just there to waste my time or get a freebie' Eventually Abigail began working from home which meant she didn't need to give the agency a cut and could do whichever hours she liked from the comfort of her own home. Explaining how she learned tricks to net herself more cash, she says: 'With one eye on the timer, I stretched and bent my way through private sessions, trying to prolong everything. 'I got adept at taking my clothes off very slowly, and letting the camera travel over the planes of my body as if I was simply teasing the client, instead of watching the money rack up. 'I suggested treats: ""Oh, I have another toy you'd love. Let me get it!"" If I could get them to pay for staring at an empty screen in anticipation, I would.' 'I suggested treats: ""Oh, I have another toy you'd love. Let me get it!"" If I could get them to pay for staring at an empty screen in anticipation, I would' But eventually, she says, she became jaded, exhausted by the myriad fake personalities she had created to speak to clients. And her boyfriend grew tired of her subconsciously slipping into stripper mode whenever they had sex. So she quit, abandoning her online profile and quietly slipping away from that world and back into her own one. 'Today, I barely think about it,' she says. 'Except when, occasionally, I find myself accidentally looking back over my shoulder at a current lover as I undress, bending seductively forward - just like I used to.

"Samoa's players have threatened to boycott their side’s clash with England at Twickenham in next week after accusing their cash-strapped union of ‘incompetence’ and financial mismanagement. It emerged on Wednesday that senior Samoan players wrote to the International Rugby Board last week threatening to take strike action in protest at their union’s failure to pay for flights and transport as well as a lack of financial transparency. ‘As players, we're unhappy with the incompetence of the Samoan Rugby Union in its current shape and under its current leadership,’ said the unnamed source in a letter addressed to the IRB and leaked to the Rugby Paper. Samoa's players have threatened to boycott their side’s clash with England at Twickenham in next week . ‘We would like to notify you that we have called for the resignation of a number of senior officials within the Samoan Rugby Union and will be boycotting our game against England on the 22nd of November should our feelings not be addressed. ‘As a unified players group, it is felt that these issues are affecting our success on the field and we can no longer play under such poor leadership. ‘This has been coming for years. We're so poorly managed and poorly governed at the top and the players have had enough. There's heavy stuff going on. 'There's no communication between the SRU and the players, no transparency over funding and rugby in Samoa is dying out. The players are unified that the England game will not happen and that it's the only way to make the big-wigs take notice.’ Samoa's players accused their cash-strapped union of ‘incompetence’ and financial mismanagement . The IRB on Wednesday night confirmed the letter was genuine but insisted strike action, which would cost the RFU several million pounds, will be averted following talks between Samoa’s players – who earn a tiny fraction in comparison to England’s players – and union representatives. ‘On October 27, the IRB was made aware of concerns raised by the Samoa senior men's national squad regarding the administration of the Samoa Rugby Union,’ an IRB statement read. ‘This included an indication that the players would withdraw from the match against England on November 22 if their concerns were not heard. ‘Subsequently, the IRB engaged in dialogue with the Samoa Rugby Union and the International Rugby Players' Association to facilitate urgent and collaborative resolution. Unknown source: ‘As players, we're unhappy with the incompetence of the Samoan Rugby Union' ‘With all parties, including the players, committed to ongoing dialogue, just under two weeks ago the players withdrew their proposed action to withdraw from the England match and the IRB fully expects the Union to undertake its obligation to honour its November Test programme commitment in full.’ The IRB announced a five-player shortlist for their world player of the year award which Ireland's Jonny Sexton the only British or Irish player to be named.

"The dead body of a Chinese street racer who killed himself in a horrific accident has been left in the road as a warning to other drivers. The driver, 28-year-old Tao Lung, was speeding along in a £79,000 Jaguar F-Type when he crashed while trying to overtake another car. The two cars were speeding at over 150mph . on the residential street when another car pulled out of a house, . causing one of the two racers to crash after it failed to brake in time. Pedestrians gather around the body of 28-year-old Tao Lung, killed in China during a street race. Police deliberately left the body uncovered as an example to other driers . Lung, who was driving in Kunming city, . Yunnan province, China, struck the kerb and hit a tree that tore off the roof and a wheel, throwing him from the vehicle . He was then run over by the second car which killed him instantly. Residents said they were fed up with people racing on the street, and warned police it was only a matter of time before there was an accident. The driver hit a car coming out of a driveway before slamming into a tree, throwing him from the vehicle . The body was left uncovered for an hour while police investigated the crash and cleared the wreckage of the sports car away . One said: 'Because the people here who drive fast are rich the police don't want to tackle them.' When police arrived they did not cover up the body, but left it exposed in full view of the crowd. A resident said: 'I think they wanted to get the message across that driving like this has a cost, sometimes its more than someone might want to pay. I think that was why they left the body lying there for so long.' The corpse was left lying in the middle of the road for at least an hour in full view of pedestrians and other motorists, including children. Police concluded their investigation, cleared away the wrecked vehicle, and only then was Lung's body loaded into a funeral van. The Jaguar sports car he was driving has a supercharged engine and can accelerate from 0-60mph in just 4.2 seconds, with a top speed of 186 miles per hour. The cars were said to be travelling at 150mph at the time, close to the Jaguar's top speed of 186mph . Residents in the neighbourhood have complained about street racing before and say that nothing has been done about it because the perpetrators are wealthy . China is responsible for at least 220,000 road deaths every year, more than any other country in the world, and contributing almost a quarter of people killed on the world's roads. The country has roughly a third of the vehicles of the US, but has 20,000 more fatalities each year. While street racing may be more famous in America and Tokyo, the Beijing Evening News reports that it is a growing trend in China, especially among young men. Videos from across the country are regularly posted on YouTube and feature heavily modified cars going bumper-to-bumper, often in heavy traffic. The races reportedly take place for respect and prestige, rather than money, with some clubs requiring members to be under a certain age and have cars worth a certain value.","Tao Lung, 28, was killed instantly after crashing in Kunming City, China .

"Amorous fish could be responsible for a mysterious humming noise keeping people awake at night. Residents in a part of Southampton, Hamsphire, have been struggling to get to sleep because of the puzzling noise, which starts at 10pm and drones on all night. Some people have even moved away from the affected area around Hythe and are sleeping on friends’ sofas to escape the nightmare. Midshipman fish are believed to be responsible for a humming noise keeping residents in a part of Southampton awake at night . The sound heard on Southampton Water (pictured) is said to be similar to the so-called West Seattle Hum which plagued parts of the US city this time last year . Now scientists are studying whether the noise could be being caused by fish having sex in an estuary nearby. Midshipman male fish let out a distinctive drone to let females know they are searching for a mate. The noise can go on for hours and often increases in volume as competing males attempt to out-hum each other. Incredibly, scientists say the sound can be amplified by bouncing off buildings and ships. The noise is famous in Seattle in Washington, USA, as midshipman fish are believed to live in the nearby Duwamish waterway. Observers say the sound heard on Southampton Water is similar to the so-called West Seattle Hum, which plagued parts of the US city this time last year. Midshipman male fish let out a distinctive drone to let females know they are searching for a mate . The National Oceanography Centre in Southampton was unable to shed any light on the mystery. However, the Scottish Association for Marine Science claimed fish could be responsible for the bizarre buzzing sound. Dr Ben Wilson said: 'It’s not beyond the realms of possibility. The midshipman fish is famed for the distinctive humming noise made by the males when they are looking for a mate. They are normally nocturnal animals and can be found buried in mud or sand during the day. They make a range of noises, including a series of short grunts, known as a 'grunt train', along with a low growl, that can be used when a male is guarding his nest. The long hums the fish are well-known for however can last up to an hour and are produced by two muscles contracting on the swim bladder. While they have been known to prevent some living close to water from getting to sleep, research into their 'singing' could prove to be beneficial to humans. The fish is able to avoid deafening itself with its own noise by turning down its sensitivity to noise, a mechanism which could also be used by humans. Research into the fish's vocal and auditory mechanism could also help increase understanding of human speech and auditory pathways. 'There are certainly ""sonic fish"" in the north Atlantic and the approaches to the English Channel.' The mystery hum is making life a misery for people living on both sides of Southampton Water. The din has so far sparked dozens of complaints from residents suffering sleepless nights, who have come up with a number of other theories themselves. They have blamed everything from heavy industry to tugboats and tanker ships operating out of Southampton Docks. Resident Linda Zammit of Woolston, Southampton, said: 'I thought I was going mad at first. I hear it every night unless it’s windy or raining. 'It doesn’t keep me awake but it stops me getting back to sleep if I do happen to wake up.' Maria Dennett, of Sholing, Southampton, said: 'We regularly experience a humming noise at night. 'A few times we put it down to a neighbour’s washing machine or dishwasher but it’s happening so frequently that we know it’s not the case. 'It’s a really low pitched sound that literally pulsates through the house.' New Forest District Council has now received more than 30 complaints about the irritating hum. A spokesman said noise monitoring equipment had been installed in several properties in a bid to track down the origin of the sound.","Residents in Hythe, Southampton, are being kept awake by the noise .

"Wayne Rooney will win his 100th England cap on Saturday when he leads the side out against Sloveia at Wembley. Here, we look back at Matt Lawton's match report from the night he made his bow for his country. Wayne Rooney (left) battles for the ball against Australia's Craig Moore during the defeat . Sven Goran Eriksson gave Rooney his first cap for England as a 17-year-old . ENGLAND (4-4-2): James (Robinson 45min); Neville (Mills 45), Ferdinand (Brown 45), Campbell (King 45), A Cole (Konchesky 45); Beckham (Hargreaves 45), Lampard (Murphy 45), Scholes (Jenas 45), Dyer (Vassell 45); Beattie (Jeffers 45), Owen (Rooney 45). Subs not used: Wright, J Cole, Upson, Parker, Davis. Scorer: Jeffers 69. AUSTRALIA (4-4-2): Schwarzer; Neill, Moore, Popovic (Vidmar 72), Lazaridis; Emerton, Okon (Muscat 87), Skoko (Bresciano 45), Chipperfield (Grella 76); Viduka (Sterjovski 85), Kewell (Aloisi 56). Subs not used: Kalac, Tiatto. Scorers: Popovic 15, Kewell 41, Emerton 85. Booked: Lazaridis. Referee: Manuel Enrique Mejuto Gonzalez (Spain). Attendance: 34,590. Full marks for the Socceroos, plus marks for the Socceroonies and a large black mark for Sven Goran Eriksson and the players who purport to be the current England side. If the appearance of Wayne Rooney and his young chums offered a glimmer hope for the future, the slow, agonising surrender of those who went before them caused only anxiety at Upton Park last night. So disappointing were Eriksson's troubled side in the first half of this ludicrous friendly that his confirmation that all 11 members of the 'A' team would be replaced by Wayne and the Wannabes resembled something akin to a tactical masterstroke. England's first XI were awful, losing to a far more industrious and infinitely more inventive Australia in a fashion alarmingly reminiscent of that shambles against Macedonia in Southampton last October. For Eriksson it was a catastrophe, and not just because a first defeat to our friends from Down Under now sits on his c.v. as England coach. Appeasing the clubs by limiting his players to no more than 45 minutes was always going to be a risky business. Last night, it was made to look utterly foolish. This was England's one and only chance to prepare for next month's European Championship doubleheader against Liechtenstein and Turkey. In the end, they did not even have the opportunity to restore some much-needed confidence after the break. Eriksson made a total of 11 changes at half-time, including the then-Everton star Rooney . Harry Kewell rounds goalkeeper David James to score Australia's second of the night . Eriksson might have apologised on the eve of this encounter for the fact that England caps are cheap these days but there can be no excuse for giving away defeats in as reckless a manner as this. Australia, who had not played together for 15 months, took little more than 15 minutes to inflict the first blow, Tony Popovic opening the scoring with a far-post header, before Harry Kewell added to England's humiliation three minutes before the halftime whistle. What a pity the Leeds United forward enjoys so little exposure in the international arena. How Rooney must have felt was anybody's guess. Not only was he denied the chance to join the big boys for what should have been a joyous occasion for England's youngest international, but he and his inexperienced colleagues were being asked to rescue a most embarrassing situation for the seniors. They did better than many perhaps imagined, taking the lead in the latter of what were two games of one half with a fine goal from Francis Jeffers before losing the chance to gloat when Brett Emerton added Australia's third in the 83rd minute. Even so, they still did a good deal better than David Beckham and Co. Francis Jeffers is congratulated by Rooney and Danny Mills having halved the deficit at 201 . Rooney showed that, even at 17 and 111 days, he is certainly man enough for the job. His talent is raw, his ability still a touch unrefined, but he made an immediate impression that gave the 'B' team real impetus. Controlling the ball on his chest quite beautifully, he then exchanged passes with the impressive Jermaine Jenas and unleashed a long-range pass that fell at the feet of Darius Vassell. At that stage it was England's best move of the match and almost ended in a goal but for Vassell's failure to hit the target. Jeffers, another product of the Everton youth team until moving to Arsenal, took his goal wondercumbing-fully, meeting a 70th-minute cross from Jenas with a perfect header. Another bright spot was Owen Hargreaves demonstrating the same World Cup form that should see him restored to the first team for next month's matches. The kids did well, particularly when one considers they were faced with an Australia team that made just one change at halftime and were already two up. Sucto Emerton's goal when the Feyenoord striker ran on to a John Aloisi pass before diverting the ball through the legs of Paul Robinson was no disgrace. David Beckham lies dejected on the floor during the defeat at Upton Park in February 2003 . Had an understandably disillusioned crowd known just how depressing the first half would be, they would have urged the FA to kick off as planned at eight o'clock. As it was, travel chaos and a halfempty stadium persuaded the organisers to put the start back by 15 minutes, which succeeded only in delaying the embarrassment. Before the start, David James must have relished the chance to appear at Upton Park without the burden of standing behind the worst defence in the Premiership. By the time Australia had scored, though, he must have felt he was back playing for West Ham. Those with the most to prove all tried to make an early impression. Kieron Dyer looked busy down the left, Frank Lampard passed smoothly from the centre and a cross that was intended for Michael Owen turned into an attempt on goal for James Beattie. Rooney came on as a second-half substitute for striker Michael Owen . VIDEO Carrick hails 'special' skipper Rooney . That, however, was about as good as it got for England's 'A' team and it was not long before Frank Farina's spirited side had taken control. Popovic has already made Michael Owen's life a misery twice this season as a centre half for Crystal Palace and he added England to his illustrious list of scalps when he escaped the attentions of Gary Neville to head the ball home at the far post. A terrific save from James then denied Mark Viduka a second for Australia but there was little he could do when Rio Ferdinand allowed Kewell to muscle him off the ball, drag the ball wide of the England goalkeeper and shoot into an empty net. With the second half came an improvement from England's lions cubs, a performance of some promise for which they did not deserve the boos they received at the final whistle. After the Ashes and the Davis Cup, such displeasure should have been reserved for those responsible.

"Maxine Peake has questioned people’s motivation for starting a family, saying: ‘Having children is very selfish.’ The actress – who recently revealed her heartache at spending years trying to conceive – said there was a ‘vanity’ in wanting to continue the family bloodline. Miss Peake, known for her starring role in BBC legal drama Silk, explored ‘every avenue’ – including IVF – before finally accepting defeat. She also suffered the agony of two miscarriages. Scroll down for video . Reflection: Silk star Maxine Peake said there was a ‘vanity’ in wanting to continue the family bloodline . Strong woman: The actress is known for her role as no-nonsense barrister Martha Costello in the BBC's Silk . Her hardships have led the 40-year-old to reflect on why people have children in the first place. She told The Times how an actor friend had announced to her that he was too selfish to have children. It prompted her to reply: ‘No, you’re wrong. Having children is very selfish. There is a vanity and selfishness in some respects in believing you must continue your genes and bloodline.’ Miss Peake said that watching her long-term boyfriend, television art director Pawlo Wintoniuk, 43, care for both his parents before they died had also made her wonder whether it would be less selfish not to have children. She added: ‘It made me think I wouldn’t want to have my kids looking after me like that.’ Speaking of her struggle to conceive, she said: ‘Paw loves kids and we’ve had a go. ‘But it hasn’t worked. That is the case for many people. It is maddening, really, that women have these biological clocks, that just when they are getting used to one stage, they must go on to the next. 'I am so much more creative and brave than when I was a teenager. In my forties I have this fearlessness to keep exploring. I don’t mind rolling around on the floor any more, looking a fool.’ Miss Peake said that since she went public about her infertility, several female friends had thanked her for speaking out, saying the problem was often viewed as something shameful.

Her parents divorced and her mother moved in with a new boyfriend, leaving Miss Peake to live with her self-educated, passionately socialist step-grandfather for six years. He worked at Leyland Motors and, despite his intelligence, had no ambition to ‘better’ himself. However, he did influence Miss Peake’s political beliefs. At the age of 18, she joined the Communist party. Although no longer active she has left-leaning views and has just finished a radio drama about women involved in the miners’ strike. She and Mr Wintoniuk are now exploring adoption. ‘It might involve rethinking things, because I’m away so much,’ she said. ‘But being so close to my step-grandad, I know that relationships with people unrelated by blood can be very strong.’ Miss Peake is currently starring in costume drama The Village, in which she plays a farmer’s wife who loses her son in the First World War.","Actress told The Times there was element of 'vanity' to continuing bloodline .

"The partial remains of Tennessee nursing student Holly Bobo have been found in Tennessee more than three years after her disappearance from the driveway of her rural home, officials said on Monday. The remains, which included a skull, were found in a Decatur County wood, not far from her home in the town of Parsons, about 110 miles east of Memphis, Tennessee Bureau of Investigation Director Mark Gwyn told a news conference. Bobo was 20 when she disappeared in April, 2011. Her brother told police that he saw a man dressed in camouflage leading her away into the woods. Investigators and volunteers scoured the woods and fields of the town of about 2,400 for clues, but her remains were not found.

Since Bobo disappeared, the small town of Parsons and surrounding areas in West Tennessee tried to support the family, putting up pink ribbons on lamp posts, mailboxes and storefronts. Bobo was wearing a pink shirt and carrying a pink purse before she disappeared. Two men found a skull Sunday not far from property owned by the family of Zachary Adams, who has been charged with Bobo's kidnapping and murder. He has pleaded not guilty.

"Outrage sparked by photos showing Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, who gave birth seven months ago, with double chin . Fans say actress, 38, should lose weight fast 'like Victoria Beckham did' She is a former Miss World, a successful Bollywood star and married to the son of one of India's best-loved stars. She found international fame in the Hollywood film Bride and Prejudice, and Julia Roberts billed her as the world's most beautiful woman. Thanks to the notoriety such fame and fortune has brought her, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan has become one of the most admired and revered women in India, and indeed the world. But such fame has come at a cost for the 38-year-old star. Since the birth of her daughter in November last year, Aishwarya Rai has been open about the fact that she is in no hurry to lose the few extra pounds she gained during her pregnancy. Scroll down for video . Letting her fans down? Former Miss World and Bollywood star Aishwarya Rai Bachchan has been lambasted by followers who suggest she should have lost her baby weight following the birth of her daughter . The model and actress, who won the Miss World title in 1994, defended her choice, saying she wanted simply to 'enjoy motherhood.' But with the star, who married Abhishek Bachchan, the son of India's most loved film star Amitabh Bachnan in 2007, tipped for her 10th appearance at Cannes next week, furious speculation is mounting as to how she will look. Commentators have been unkind, lambasting the star for letting her fans down. Many have gone a step further, suggesting the star has a 'duty' to her fans to regain her pre-pregnancy figure. One website posted a video of the star looking less than her usual svelte self, flicking between photographs of her pre-birth, and photos now. Svelte: Aishwarya Rai at the Oscars last February when she was in the very early stages of her pregnancy, and at last year's Cannes Festival in May, six months before she gave birth to her daughter . Called 'Aishwarya Rai's shocking weight gain', the clip, which came accompanied by elephant sound effects,  has been seen more than 500,000 times. Dozens more videos in a similar vein have been posted, each with viewing figures in the tens or hundreds of thousands. Comments left after the video prove that many of those watching have little sympathy for Aishwarya. 'She is a Bollywood actress and it is her duty to look good and fit,' one said. Another added: 'She needs to learn from people like Victoria Beckham who are back to size zero weeks after their delivery.' It has opened up a debate in the country, and beyond, about the attitudes held towards women in the public eye. Some unkind fans have compared Aishwarya to Victoria Beckham, saying she should lose weight as quickly as Ms Beckham did after her four pregnancies . 'Aishwarya is like a goddess,' said showbusiness columnist Shobhaa Dé in the New York Daily News by way of explanation. 'She is held up as the ideal of beauty and so there is an expectation on her to look perfect at all times.' 'The most beautiful woman in the world': Aishwarya Rai won Miss World in 1994 . 'The role models being held up are Angelina Jolie and Victoria Beckham, but our body frames are different – we have wider hips and curves – so this whole business of looking desperately skinny two weeks after giving birth is a western import.' Cinema professor Shohini Ghosh added that women in India were up against an almost impossible task. 'There is a glorification of motherhood in India and Indian cinema,' he told the paper. 'But people are confused because they don't know whether to glorify Aishwarya in her new motherhood or lament that she is not looking like a runway model.' It's safe to say that far too many fall into the latter category, judging by the cruel comments flooding internet sites. Some, however, have come out in defence of the star, saying that she, like any new mother, should be focusing on her infant, not her diet. 'She is a real women looking after a baby. We should be concern for her health and happiness especially if she is nursing the baby. Not the Western belief of expecting people in the spot light to lose all weight in month. If she﻿ dieted what will happen to the baby's diet,' one said. 'That's because Aish is not one of those selfish ones who puts the focus on their bodies instead of their babies, which makes them moody and ineffective as parents,' another said. 'Kudos to you Aish for keeping it real and letting your baby have all the bonding and attention she needs with you. Enjoy your life.'

"A blogger for a school in Utah has lost his job after he wrote a post explaining what a homophone is and his boss accused him of promoting a gay agenda. Until his recent dismissal, Tim Torkildson worked as a social media strategist for the Nomen Global Language Center in Provo, a private language school which aims to help students with their English. One of Torkildon’s tasks was writing about the English language and his last post had focused on explaining what homophones are. Scroll down for video .

Homophones are words that sound the same but have different meanings and often different spellings such as be and bee, through and threw, which and witch. When Torkildson’s boss, and the school’s owner, Clarke Woodger read the article he called him into his office and told him he was fired. ‘Now our school is going to be associated with homosexuality,’ Woodger complained, according to Torkildson, who posted their exchange on his blog. He also claims that Woodger told him that the only job he would ever succeed in would be 'something clerical', where he would be 'closely supervised and have immediate goals at all times.' Torkildson . said that while he understood that the word’s 'homo' prefix might cause . controversy, but he said that the explanation he had given had been . 'straightforward' and something that those in the early stages of . learning English needed to know. Video courtesy of The Daily English Show . Torkildson included this helpful diagram on his blog to help explain what homophones are . The homophones explanation has since been removed from the language school’s website. A cached version, however, was entitled Help With Homophones #1 and began: 'In English a homophone is a word that has several different meanings and spellings, but always sounds the same. 'The best way to learn these tricky words is to memorize them little by little.  Today we will begin with homophones that start with the letter A: Ad is an advertisement. Add is a mathematical function. 'Ail is to be sick.  Ale is an alcoholic beverage. Aye means yes.  Eye is what you see with.' Torkildson told MailOnline he began working for the language school in April and was there part-time for 30 hours a week. His blog was written on July 2 and he left the firm nine days later.

"Chelsea announced a record annual profit of around £18.4million on Thursday — paving the way for Jose Mourinho to further strengthen his squad in January. The current Premier League leaders also reported a record turnover of £319.8m for the year up to June 30, and will comfortably pass UEFA’s Financial Fair Play (FFP) test thanks to the funds brought in by the sale of Juan Mata and David Luiz, plus their share of the new £1bn television deal. This is the second time in three years that Chelsea have posted a profit and is further proof of the club's emergence as British football’s leading club on and off the pitch, confounding the belief that years of wild spending under Roman Abramovich would backfire. Chelsea are set to announce a report profit of £20m for the year ending on June 30 . 2004 - Loss £74.7m . 2005 - Loss £131.6m . 2006 - Loss £77.1m . 2007 - Loss £65.6m . 2008 - Loss £69.2m . 2009 - Loss £45.8m . 2010 - Loss £69.2m . 2011 - Loss £70.7m . 2012 - Profit £1.4m . 2013 - Loss £49.4m . 2014 - Profit 18.4m . Although they turned a £67m loss into a £1.4m profit in 2012, this is the first real sign that Chelsea are making progress without having to rely on the wealth of their billionaire Russian owner, and the cash bounty could enable Mourinho to bring in new recruits when the transfer window re-opens in order to cement what is already looking like becoming a successful title challenge. Chairman Bruce Buck said: ‘The club is naturally pleased to record a significant profit for 2013/14. By reaching the Champions League semi-final and maintaining a challenge in the Premier League until the final week of the season we demonstrated that, while improving our financial figures, we remained competitive in football’s toughest club competitions. ‘We financed player purchases from sales as the squad for this current season was shaped, and our philosophy since Mr Abramovich acquired the club in 2003 has been to build upon success on the pitch. 'That is evident in the partnerships we signed and in our fanbase growth which contributed to the new record turnover figure and the profit made. We have done all of this at the same time as creating one of the world’s leading football community programmes through the Chelsea Foundation. Juan Mata was sold to Manchester United in January in a £38million deal . David Luiz left Chelsea for Paris Saint-Germain this summer in a £50million move . ‘Going forward, we have ambitious plans to build a pioneering global commercial programme, partnering with innovative and market-leading organisations from around the world. In the era of FFP, we must progress commercially to continue the circle of success to invest in the team and get results.’ Meanwhile, the club are unlikely to move to a new stadium for at least seven years. After failing with a £300m bid for the site of the Battersea power station, they are now looking at the possibility of expanding Stamford Bridge, despite the fact it could prove far more costly. Even if they agree on a new site, estimates suggest it would be five years before work began and a further two years to complete.","Chelsea announce record profits during Roman Abramovich era .

"She may not have been as famous as Barbara Cartland. But on the longevity front, Mills & Boon writer Ida Pollock has earned her place in history. The world’s oldest author, she has died aged 105 – just weeks before the publication of her 125th novel. Ida Pollock, 105, has been hailed as the world's oldest romantic novelist . Mrs Pollock sold millions of books over . the course of more than nine decades. At one point she produced 40 books . in five years – and once claimed she could finish a novel in six weeks. Born . in Lewisham, south London, she finished her first book at the age of . 14. In the 1930s she decided to become a full-time author, penning a . string of hits using the name Joan Allen. By 1956 she had published eight romances under five pen names – each around 70,000 words long. Mrs . Pollock went on to use ten pseudonyms and saw 70 of her books published . by Mills & Boon under the names Pamela Kent, Rose Burghley, Susan . Barrie and Mary Whistler. Many of her dashing male heroes were modelled . on her late husband Colonel Hugh Pollock, a decorated veteran who was . previously married to Enid Blyton. Earlier this year Ida said: 'A romance is never just a romance, there's adventure, mystery and movement. Prolific: Ida passion-fuelled tales have made hearts flutter for nine decades . Passion: Ida sold over a million books in her prolific career - over half through Mills & Boon - with titles such as White Heat and Interlude for Love . Ida has millions of fans but has largely avoided the limelight by writing under ten different pseudonyms . She has written 70 books for Mills & Boon under the names Susan Parrie, Pamela Kent. Rose Burghley and Mary Whistler . 'You . need a grand, dramatic setting - the Swiss Alps were always an personal . favourite of mine - and a chance meeting, on a train, a cruise, or . perhaps the hero and heroine find themselves shipwrecked on a desert . island. 'The men are normally rich, well-to-do . - but never vulgar with their money. Young men lack the maturity to . take control so an older man is essential to provide the reassurance the . heroine's needs. 'There's always a fair amount of turbulence before he sweeps in to save the day. A happy ending is an absolute must.' With her advancing years, Ida stopped using a typewriter, and instead dictated her racy tales to daughter Rosemary at their remote country home in . Lanreath near Looe, Cornwall. Rosemary, 70, said . her mother was a ‘national treasure’. She added: ‘Again and again, . readers would write to say she’d cheered them up. Her books were more . than happy endings, they were full of life, energy and optimism.’ Ida Pollock now dictates her novels to her daughter Rosemary, who is pictured here reading with her in 1967 . Many of the dashing male characters are said to . be based on Ida's late husband, Hugh Pollock (left) who was also married . to Enid Blyton. Ida wrote 70 novels for Mills & Boon, and is . pictured here with Alan Boon (right) Ida only released a handful of . books under her own name and until this year published under name of the last of her . alter-egos, Marguerite Bell. A Distant Drum, her most recent . novel, in which a young Fanny Templeton falls for the Marquis of Ordley . after clashing at the battle of Waterloo, came out in 2005. Ida's . memoirs, Starlight, were published in 2009 and her most recent works are two more Regency . romances, including her latest, The Runaway, which will be published in 2014. The Runaway is the story of a young woman who inherits a vast fortune and is forced to flee to escape several suitors. Ida, who was also a celebrated artist and . illustrator, said earlier this year that it would take her about six . weeks to write a novel. The mother-of one, who is also a celebrated . artist and illustrator, released up to eight novels in one year at her . busiest time. Ida, pictured a home in Cornwall (left) and stepping out . in the 1980s (right), said earlier this year that it takes her around six weeks to write a . novel . Ida has sold millions of books over nine decades of writing . Ida said in an interview in April this year: 'I think I was born to write. My mother would put a typewriter on the dining room table and say ""there you go"". 'My . first story was published in the Christian Herald and they would pay me . five guineas. I wrote my first novel when I was just 14. 'I . was into mysteries and thrillers at the time but I eventually I drifted . into romance because my mother would always ask me to write ""something . pretty"". 'I've never got bored of it because its something I absolutely love. My books are full of hope and romance rather than sex. 'They are a form of escapism - you can escape the parts of the world that you don't like.' Ida Pollock's writing desk in the early 1990s . Unmarried daughter Rosemary, an editor and writer, has followed in her mother's footsteps and written a number of romantic novels herself. She . said: 'Pen names are very common in romance writing. Mum's publishers . always insisted on them because readers associated different styles with . different names. 'I don't . think she's ever quite got the recognition she deserves. I've always . loved her books and I would read them over and over, especially in my . teens. 'I think her passion for writing is what has kept her going so long. She's remarkable - a national treasure'. Ida's funeral will take place in the coming days in Lanreath, where Ida lived and where she will also be buried. Dame Barbara Cartland, who died aged 98 in 2000, is said to have written over 700 books. Nightingale in the Sycamore (1957)'He moved to meet her as she moved to meet him and caught her in his arms, kissing her wildly, like a man who was starving. Her hair, eyes, cheeks, lips - he smothered them with so many kisses that before long he paused to draw breath himself. She was completely breathless, but clung to him as if never willingly would she let him go again, and for the first time for weeks she knew what it was to feel glad that she had been born. . . .'Bay of Moonlight (1968)'Their first kiss was unlike anything Sarah had ever expected of a kiss. It left her feeling as if a thunderbolt had come hurtling out of the sky and passed so close that it scorched her. And when his violent mood changed to one of gentleness, a tenderness that melted her bones, she knew that this was the moment for which she had been destined ... It was the very purpose of her life ...'A Distant Drum (2005)'She had been in bed no more than five minutes when she heard the door handle begin to turn. The movement was gentle at first. ""Open this door, or I'll break it down,"" the Marquis ordered. When there was no immediate response his fist began pounding against the woodwork, and Fanny jumped out of bed. ""I don't,"" his lordship told her, ""wish to rouse the whole house, but if it becomes necessary I shall not hesitate to do so.

The label has called on the leggy blonde model to celebrate its 75th anniversary by showcasing the SS14 capsule collection. The one that got away? Florence Brudenell-Bruce, Prince Harry's ex, is the new face of Rigby & Peller's swimwear range . Shot on location in the Bahamas by photographer Eddie Wrey, the collection is inspired by the vibrancy of Brazil, paying homage to the bright allure of the country's tropical flora and fauna, according to the brand.

She also completed a History of Art degree at Bristol University. Naturally slim, she never diets and adores baking. Florence follows her French mother’s advice on healthy eating: have a good breakfast, lunch and dinner with little snacking in between, and the metabolism will regulate itself, she says. The day before a fashion shoot she avoids large meals; on the shoot she sips ginger tea from a flask, then in the evening enjoys a Thai soup: ‘If food is spicy, it feels good for you,' she says.

"Missing the old days when everyone said ‘please’ and ‘thank you’? Wondering what happened to the glorious springs of times gone by? If so, you are far from alone. Millions of Britons are just as rueful as you about the decline in manners and the miserable weather, according to a survey. Nearly two in three of us think people have poorer manners or are not as polite as they used to be, while more than a third believe the worst thing about modern life is the bad weather. It never use to be this bad: Second on the list of things which people think are worse is the weather . To add to the glumness there are not . even any decent pubs left to drown your sorrows in, as nearly one in . three think they have got worse. The research was conducted by . internet search engine Ask Jeeves, which asked 1,000 men and women aged . from 16 to 60-plus which aspects of modern life they think have gone . downhill the most. Manners topped the list, followed by the weather. Pubs and schools were in equal third. Coverage of flooding and freezing . temperatures prompted 37 per cent to think the weather has gradually . deteriorated over the years. Television programmes and public transport came equal fifth. One in five said doctors were better . in the old days, while policemen and politicians both only narrowly . avoided places in the top ten. Gone are the days of personal banking, with more than a quarter of those quizzed, 28 per cent, saying banks are worse. More . than one in four people even said children were not as good as they . used to be, while others said doctors (20 per cent), policemen (19 per . cent) and politicians (17 per cent) used to be better. Despite coming more than 50 years . after Fings Ain’t Wot They Used T’Be was a hit for Max Bygraves, the . survey suggests that, in one way at least, little has changed in the . public consciousness since then. Just as the song tells how ‘we used to . have stars, singers who sung’, one in four said music today is not as . good as it used to be. Not as helpful: Gone are the days of personal banking with 28 per cent believing high street banks are worse . List of people's top moans . 1. Manners/politeness - 63% . 2.  Weather - 37% . 3.

One in four believe modern-day music is not as good while 17 per cent said Hollywood films were worse. Seventeen per cent said football was not as entertaining and bizarrely, 11 per cent said sex used to be better than it is now. But it's not all bad. When . it came to things that are considered better than they use to be, . people said restaurant meals and cars had improved considerably. The expansion of air travel . prompted one in 10 people to say holidays are better, while a . similar 10 per cent said fashion had improved over the decades. A spokesman for Ask Jeeves, which polled 1,000 people, said: 'Our research shows that a number of aspects of modern day life are believed to be worse than they once were. 'It is not clear whether people look . at things through 'rose-tinted spectacles' or just have a romantic . notion of things being better in the past. 'Many . people have never had it so good when it comes to things like public . transport, choice of TV channels and entertainment venues, so it is . interesting that these are often branded worse now than in the past.'

"Sex surfing: The world's most popular internet porn searches have been revealed . A country by country list of top search terms used at pornography websites has revealed vastly different preferences among individual nations when it comes to surfing the net behind closed doors. From the man caves of Malaysia to the laptops of Libya the unusual and often disturbing tastes of porn fans around the world have been laid well and truly bare. While in North America the preferred search term is 'MILF', (an acronym of which the first word is 'mother'), in Europe there is appears to be a strong national bias. Britain, Norway, Sweden, France, . Italy, Greece, Poland, Germany and the Netherlands are porno patriots . preferring to search for women or men from their own countries. But . then you get to Finland where there seems to be is a preference for . senior citizens with 'mature' and 'granny' the top two search terms . respectively, while in Hungary the term 'woodman' rates highly. Things . start to get peculiar when you hit the Ukraine where 'raincoat (gay)' is the top search, before becoming hugely disturbing in Romania where . 'mom and son' is the most popular term. But it is in Asia and the Middle East that things really start to get weird. In Syria, where you might imagine people . have little time for porn considering recent events, the preferred . search is 'Aunt' while in Iran the peculiar term 'hotel businessman . (gay)' is riding high at no.6. In North America, where internet porn is . a billion dollar business and the majority of adult sites are based, . tastes appear to vary wildly from state to state.

"New U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry today refused to back Britain's stance in the battle with Argentina over the future of the Falklands, after starting his first overseas trip in London. Mr Kerry pointedly refused to support next month's referendum among Falklanders on whether they want to remain British. The issue is thought to have been raised by Foreign Secretary William Hague after Mr Kerry held talks in Downing Street with David Cameron. Scroll down for video . U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry appeared alongside British Foreign Secretary William Hague at a press conference today, where he insisted America's position on the Falkands was unchanged . At a press conference in the Foreign . Office, standing alongside Mr Hague, Mr Kerry insisted the U.S. position . on the Falklands had not changed. 'We continue to urge a peaceful . resolution of this critical issue. Let me be very clear about our . position with respect to the Falklands, which I believe is clear. 'First of all, I’m not going to comment, nor is the President, on a referendum that has yet to take place, hasn’t taken place. 'Our position on the Falklands has . not changed. The United States recognises de facto UK administration of . the islands but takes no position on the question of parties’ sovereignty claims thereto. 'We support co-operation between UK and Argentina on practical matters.' Diplomats in London believe it is a major coup that John Kerry chose Britain for his first overseas trip as US Secretary of State to hold talks with PM David Cameron . The two men discusses Syria, the Middle East Peace process and US-EU trade, but did not raise the prospect of Britain leaving the European Union . Mr Cameron became the first world . leader to meet with Mr Kerry since his appointment, at the start of an . 11-day tour of Europe and the Middle East. At . a meeting in Downing Street the two men discussed a new transatlantic . trade deal between the U.S. and the EU, before touching on Syria, the Arab . Spring and the Middle East Peace Process. Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has stepped up her country's claim to he Falkland Islands . Mr Kerry’s decision to use his first foreign trip since replacing Hillary Clinton to visit London is being seen as significant. Mrs Clinton travelled first to Asia after taking office. Mr Kerry said: 'This is no accident that this is the first stop of my trip as Secretary of State.' Officials said the decision to start the trip in Europe starting ‘underscores the degree to which we have common interests and values with our key European partners, the degree to which we work so closely together in meeting the enormous challenges that we both face around the world’. But it comes after transatlantic relations were strained when President Barack Obama and other senior American figures warned against Britain leaving the European Union. Downing Street said that Mr Kerry did . not raise the issue of Britain's possible exit from the European Union . as a result of the referendum promised by Mr Cameron during the next . Parliament. But ahead of the . talks, a senior state department official said: ‘The President himself . addressed it in saying that we support a strong UK voice in a strong . European Union. ‘And if asked, the Secretary will repeat that position. It’s our interest, and we’ve made that clear.’ William Hague (pictured left) described the relationship between the UK and the US as an 'indispensable alliance' and said today¿s talks were 'detailed and very thorough' Mr Kerry waved to the media as he passed between meetings on the first day of an 11-day tour of Europe and the Middle East . In the run-up to Mr Cameron's announcement of his referendum plan last month, the White House had signalled its preference from Britain to remain part of a strong EU. As the United States' global representative, John Kerry is expected to have a firm grasp on geography. But during his first major speech as the new US secretary of state, it seems he invented a whole new country. Speaking . at the University of Virginia, Mr Kerry praised State employees who . work in dangerous parts of the world and 'support democratic . institutions in Kyrzakhstan'. Except the country does not exist. Mr Kerry was actually referring to Kyrgyzstan, which he appeared to merge with its wealthier neighbour, Kazakhstan. But the spokesman said that the European focus of today's discussions was the free trade agreement and the potential for using the UK-chaired meeting of the G8 group of rich states in Northern Ireland in June to take the process forward. Mr Cameron and Mr Kerry ‘reiterated their shared determination to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran’, said the spokesman. Both men were hoping for progress on . the issue at the meeting of the P5+1 group - made up of the US, UK, . Russia, China, France and Germany - with representatives of the Tehran . regime in Almaty, Kazakhstan, this week. Mr . Cameron and Mr Kerry agreed on ‘the importance of restarting a viable . peace process’ in the Middle East, said the spokesman. And he said they . discussed ‘the challenges posed by fragile states around the world and . how the US and UK will continue to work together on these issues’. They . also discussed the situations in Egypt and Libya following the fall of . long-standing regimes as a result of the Arab Spring. But . the issue of the Falklands was not raised, said Mr Cameron's official . spokesman. It is understood that the UK's row with Argentina over the . future of the islands is likely to be discussed when Mr Kerry meets . Foreign Secretary William Hague later today. A . US official said: ‘If we’re asked about the Falklands, we would . underscore we’ve said before, which is that we recognize the de facto . British administration of the islands and we don’t take a position on . sovereignty.’ After leaving Downing Street, Mr Kerry walked to the Foreign Office where he met with William Hague . Mr Kerry, who . took office as Secretary of State at the start of this month following . the resignation of Hillary Clinton, is also due to visit Berlin, Paris, . Rome, Ankara, Cairo, Riyadh, Abu Dhabi and Doha during the current tour. John Kerry, 69, was born in Denver, Colorado, in 1943 and was educated at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. He fought in the Vietnam War as a gunboat officer with the U.S. Navy and earned several military honours. Mr Kerry then worked for a district attorney in Massachusetts before served as the lieutenant governor of the same state in 1982. He won a Massachusetts Senate seat in 1984 and ran as the Democratic nomination for president against George Bush in 2004. Mr Kerry became Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman in 2009 and was last year nominated by President Barack Obama to succeed Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State. Mr Hague described the relationship between the UK and the US as an 'indispensable alliance' and said today’s talks were 'detailed and very thorough'. 'Top of our agenda was the Middle East, including the importance we both attach to ending the Israeli/Palestinian conflict,' said Mr Hague. 'I welcome the focus that he has brought to bear on this issue since his appointment. There is no more urgent foreign policy priority in 2013 than restarting negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. 'The region and the world can’t afford the current dangerous impasse in the peace process. If we don’t make progress very soon, then the two-state solution could become impossible to achieve. 'There is a burning need for the international community to revive the peace process in efforts led by the United States and supported by European, Arab and other nations. My promise to Secretary Kerry today was that the United Kingdom will make every effort to mobilise the European Union and Arab states behind decisive moves for peace.'","US Secretary of State chooses Britain as first stop on 11-day tour .

"Authorities in Zurich will today open 'sex boxes' in a bid to improve the safety of prostitutes and regulate the sex industry . The nine boxes in a former industrial estate have been built at a cost of £1.5 million. They will be in use daily, from early evening until 5am. 'Sex box': Drivers can view women in one zone before entering one of 15 secluded shelters . Discreet: The drive-in sex booths are an effort to improve prostitutes' working conditions and take power away from pimps . Customers will cruise past a line of 40 prostitutes before selecting one and negotiating a fee. They will then drive into one of the wooden sheds, which display safe sex posters. The boxes are equipped with panic alarms which can be activated if the clients or prostitutes feel in any danger. Michael Herzig, director of social services for sex workers in the city, said: 'Prostitution is a business basically. 'We . cannot prohibit it, so we want to control it in favour of the sex . workers and the population because if we do not control it, organised . crime is taking over, and the pimps are taking over.' Workplace: The boxes in Zurich will allow prostitutes to conduct their business in more privacy . Rules of engagement: Clients are shown clearly what acceptable behaviour is, including a ban on photography and more than one customer at a time . Orderly: Located along a clearly marked path, the drive-in structures are for car customers only . The sex workers have to register with a health insurer and buy a 'work ticket' for £3.50 . each night that they work. So far 283 permits have been issued. Prostitution in Zurich is now confined to the booths and two other zones. The scheme is supported by residents, who were sick of the effects of street prostitution along the bank of the Limmat river in the city centre. Similar initiatives are already in use in German cities including Essen and Cologne.","Drive-in sex chalets in Zurich are aimed to improve security for prostitutes .

"First ladies typically avoid getting into public scraps, but Michelle Obama has jumped into perhaps her biggest battle yet. She's fighting a House Republican effort to soften a central part of her prized anti-childhood obesity campaign and she says she's ready 'to fight until the bitter end.' Mrs. Obama even mocked the GOP effort in an opinion column and argued her case before her Twitter followers. Determined: First Lady Michelle Obama, seen here with students at Ron Rosner YMCA in Virginia, is fighting GOP efforts to downscale elements of her hard-won anti-obesity campaign . 'Remember a few years ago when Congress declared that the sauce on a slice of pizza should count as a vegetable in school lunches?' she wrote in The New York Times. 'You don't have to be a nutritionist to know that this doesn't make much sense. Yet we're seeing the same thing happening again with these new efforts to lower nutrition standards in our schools.'Mrs. Obama lobbied largely behind the scenes four years ago for the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, which requires more fruit, vegetables and whole grains in school meals, along with less sodium, sugar and fat. It was a major achievement, the first update to school lunch rules in decades designed to make school meals more nutritious.The School Nutrition Association, an industry-backed group that represents school cafeteria workers and originally supported the standards, has now turned against them. The association says it fully supports getting kids to eat healthier but says many districts are losing money because students aren't buying the healthier lunches.More than 1 million fewer students eat lunch at school each day since the first round of standards went into effect in 2012, following decades of steadily increasing participation, said Diane Pratt-Heavner, a spokeswoman for the association. A second round of rules, including standards for school breakfasts, took effect July 1.'How can we call these standards a success when they are driving students away from the program?' she said. Pizza sauce is not a vegetable: First lady Michelle Obama, tending the White House garden with the help of school children in 2013, says she won't allow nutrition standards in schools to be lowered . Her group wants more flexibility for districts that are losing money. A House bill to fund the Agriculture Department next year would give districts a chance to apply to skip the requirements for one year. Rep. Robert Aderholt of Alabama, the Republican author of that measure, said the lunch rules go too far and came too fast for school districts to handle. 'As well-intended as the people in Washington believe themselves to be, the reality is that from a practical standpoint these regulations are just plain not working out in some individual school districts,' he said after a House panel approved the bill. A vote by the full House is expected after its July Fourth break. The first lady and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, whose department runs the school meals program, oppose changing the law. Critics of the association say the about-face is motivated not only by overburdened school officials but also by the food industry. Food companies are some of the association's highest-paying members and supply schools with most of their food. The industry largely has kept silent through the debate but will spend millions of dollars to reformulate many products to meet the new standards. 'The last thing that we can afford to do right now is play politics with our kids' health, especially when we're finally starting to see some progress on this issue,' Mrs. Obama said at the White House, where she met with a group of school nutrition experts, all of whom were friendly toward the standards. Hot potato: Mrs Obama says children's health should not become a political issue . The association requested a meeting with Mrs. Obama and Vilsack. Instead it was invited to sit down next week with Vilsack and Sam Kass, a White House chef who is executive director of the first lady's anti-obesity initiative, along with representatives from a dozen other organizations that favor the standards. The first lady's publicly aggressive approach against Congress and the school nutrition association stands in stark contrast to the quiet lobbying she did early on, and to her handling of earlier controversies. Her approach has been to bite her tongue and not comment in the heat of the moment. 'She very, very strongly believes in the anti-obesity initiative, and I think she sees the attempt by Congress to roll back the 2010 legislation as just being anathema after trying very hard to change the culture of what we see going into these institutional lunches,' said Myra Gutin, who studies first ladies at Rider University. Mrs. Obama says the requirements are based on sound science and that 90 per cent of schools are meeting them. The association says districts are unprepared to meet the newest standards. 'I'm going to fight until the bitter end to make sure that every kid in this country continues to have the best nutrition that they can have in our schools,' the first lady said at a White House event where she showcased elementary school students preparing and then eating a salad lunch using vegetables they had planted in her garden on the South Lawn. The White House has threatened to veto the House bill. The Senate version does not include the one-year waiver.","Michelle Obama is determined to fight efforts by the GOP to soften her anti-obesity campaign .

"Oscar Taveras, a baseball player for the St. Louis Cardinals, had been drunk behind the wheel during a car crash in the Dominican Republic that killed him and his girlfriend, authorities say. His blood alcohol level was five times the legal limit, Dominican Republic attorney general's office spokeswoman Tessie Sanchez revealed to the Associated Press on Tuesday. She also described him as 'legally intoxicated when he crashed' to the wire service. In a Tuesday statement, General Manager John Mozeliak and the St. Louis Cardinals said 'We have seen the media reports regarding Oscar Taveras that have come out this afternoon, but have yet to receive any official notification from the Dominican. Until we have the opportunity to review the official report, we cannot confirm details. Scroll down for video . Accident: An official has said the blood alcohol level of St. Louis Cardinals player Oscar Taveras, pictured, was reportedly five times the legal limit . Victim: Also killed in the October 26 car crash in the Dominican Republic was Taveras' girlfriend, 18-year-old Edilia Arvelo . Remembered: Mourners are seen carrying the casket of Oscar Taveras last month in the Dominican Republic . Accident: Taveras died on October 26, less than a year after he made his Major League debut with the St. Louis Cardinals . Funeral: Mourners are seen placing their  hands on Taveras' casket in Puerto Plata. Taveras' blood alcohol level was reportedly five times over the legal limit at the time of the crash . Procession: In this Oct. 28, 2014, file photo, people march as a hearse carries the coffin containing Taveras' body his funeral procession in Sosua, Dominican Republic . 'While we are still working to obtain the facts, it won't change the fact that this is a terrible tragedy. We have an obligation to use this as an opportunity to educate our players that they must take responsibility for themselves both on and off the field.' Taveras died in a car crash less than a year after making his Major League Baseball debut. The 22-year-old slugger's death was confirmed by his agent and newspapers in his native Dominican Republic, after he was involved in a traffic accident there on October 26. 'He wasn't carrying documents at the time of the accident, but his body was identified by family members,' Col. Diego Pesqueira of the Metropolitan Transportation Agency said of Taveras. Taveras was driving a 2014 Chevrolet Camaro at the time of the accident on a highway between the beaches of Sosua and Cabarete in Puerto Plata, about 215 miles north of the capital of Santo Domingo. Edilia Arvelo, Taveras' 18-year-old girlfriend, also died in the crash. A funeral for Taveras was held October 27 in Puerto Plata, while a funeral for Arvelo was held in her hometown of Moca that same day. Couple: Taveras was with Edilia Arvelo while driving on a highway between the beaches of Sosua and Cabarete in Puerto Plata . Promising: Taveras, seen October 12,  was regarded as one of baseball's top prospects and homered in his major league debut May 31 . Crash: Taveras and his girlfriend were in this 2014 Chevrolet Camaro . Hope: The Cardinals had just finalized plans for Taveras to spend most of November at the team's spring training facility in Jupiter, Florida, and then head to the Dominican Winter League . Taveras was a teenager when he signed with St. Louis as an international free agent in 2008. He was regarded as one of baseball's top prospects and homered in his major league debut May 31. He also had a big solo drive in the seventh inning of Game 2 in the NL Championship Series against San Francisco. The Cardinals had just finalized plans for Taveras to spend most of November at the team's spring training facility in Jupiter, Florida, and then head to the Dominican Winter League. Taveras lost the regular right fielder job to fellow rookie Randal Grichuk, but that did not diminish the organization's long-term view that Taveras could be a star. Taveras hit .239 with three homers and 22 RBIs in 80 games in his only season in the majors. Athlete: Taveras hit .239 with three homers and 22 RBIs in 80 games in his only season in the majors . Taveras was a teenager when he signed with St. Louis as an international free agent in 2008 . 'All of us throughout Major League Baseball are in mourning this evening,' baseball Commissioner Bud Selig said in a release the day of the car crash. 'Oscar, a young member of the baseball family, was full of promise and at the dawn of a wonderful career in our game, evident in his game-tying home run against the Giants exactly two weeks ago.' 'He was someone that became an identity of our organization to some degree,' Mozeliak said in a conference call the day after Taveras' death. 'When you think about how much has been written about him and how much has been talked about him, he never truly got a chance to show it at the major league level.' Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said the day after Taveras' death 'In my opinion, the word ""love"" is the most misused, and misunderstood word in the English language. It is not popular for men to use this word, and even less popular for athletes. But, there is not a more accurate word for how a group of men share a deep and genuine concern for each other. We loved Oscar, and he loved us. That is what a team does, that is what a family does. You will be missed, Oscar.' Matheny was a catcher for the Cardinals when pitcher Darryl Kile died of a heart problem in June 2002. St. Louis also lost Josh Hancock in a fatal car crash in April 2007. Each of those deaths occurred during the season, but the accident for Taveras happened with his teammates at home after losing to San Francisco in the NL Championship Series. Many of them took to Twitter to express their condolences. 'Absolute tragedy,' teammate Matt Carpenter tweeted after hearing the news. 'My prayers go out to Oscar [Taveras'] family.' 'We mourn the passing of Cardinals outfielder Oscar Taveras,' the MLB tweeted. 'Last 30 minutes I've been sick to my stomach. Keep thinking about Oscar's big smile in the dugout whenever we made a big play/got a big hit,' All-Star reliever Pat Neshek posted the day of the car crash.","The 22-year-old died October 26 in a car crash in his native Dominican Republic .

"A group of military wives trekked up a mountain and bravely bared all in temperatures of minus 4C to create a nude calendar in honour of their husbands. The Garrison Girls, who are wives of men from the three Armed services, stripped off in the Scottish mountains for the artistic shots. The women, who have never modelled before, can be seen stretched out naked on rocks by a river, walking across a narrow wooden bridge and perched in the window of a ruined castle. The October 2014 picture was taken near Moray in Aberdeenshire . The February picture was taken near Braemar in the Scottish Highlands during Arctic conditions . The June picture features two Garrison Girls, who are wives of men from the three Armed services . January 2015, like many of the pictures, includes military kit to remind people of the link to the armed forces . Helmets, berets and military kit bags are subtly placed in each of the stunning shots to remind people of the link to the armed forces. 'It was around minus 4C up the mountain and when we took our clothes off it felt like being in a freezer,' said Emma Matthias, 29, who helped co-ordinate the shoot and whose husband is a Royal Engineer based at Kinloss Barracks in Moray, Aberdeenshire. 'We were all very car sick as we drove round the winding roads to the mountain, so we turned up looking rather green. 'We then had to trek for about half an hour before posing for the pictures and we were so cold our skin started turning blue. The women, who have never modelled before, were photographed in countryside beauty spots. Pictured is March 2014, taken near Braemar . The girls' faces are obscured to show they represent all military wives. Pictured here, November 2014 . The calendars cost £10 and can be bought from www.garrisongirls.com. Pictured here, April 2014 . 'At the top of the mountain we were quite exposed and it was rather embarrassing as people could see us, but we took our dressing gowns with us to cover up between shots.' A dozen girls took part in the photo shoot, which took place in Braemar in the Scottish Highlands last autumn and a beach in Moray in Aberdeenshire during the summer. Their husbands are from army regiments, including Black Watch, the Royal Corps of Signals and the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, as well as the Royal Navy and RAF and hold all ranks from officers to privates. Scottish photographer Jim Furness, based in Dundee, carefully selected the locations for the pictures. He said: 'I set out to portray the beauty of women within nature, especially the wild landscape of Scotland and work to create images where the figure and the landscape complement each other and are empowering and liberating, rather than exploitative . 'An ex-serviceman myself, I came across plenty of pin-up style nude photography during my time in the forces in the 70s and 80s and had the idea at that time about creating beautiful, empowering nude images of women, but it wasn't until a few years ago that I actually picked up a camera and did something about it. Money raised will go to the Garrison Girls charity to help combat Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Pictured is May 2014 .

Miss December features a woman with her back to the camera in a ruined doorway, revealing her butterfly tattoo . 'Over the years I have worked with many women who have never modelled before, or had the experience of being nude outdoors in the countryside. 'Most find it to be an affirming and exhilarating experience and often find that their self-esteem and confidence in general is improved, especially when they view the resulting photos and see how wonderful they look.' Calendar organiser Sarah Bennett Thurston, 36, whose husband Paul is in the army, said she decided to make the calendar because she wanted to do something positive. 'It is very hard being a military wife and I wanted to do something to empower the girls,' she said. 'A lot of the girls have had three or four children and they were absolutely terrified taking part, but they did it because they wanted to help. 'The pictures show them as they really are with cellulite and stretch marks, but they all look amazing and I think many of them were quite surprised and pleased with the results.' Sarah, from Bournemouth, who has three children, said they had deliberately left out the girls' faces to show they represent all military wives. 'It is not about the individual girls, but who they represent,' she added. The 2014 calendars cost £10 and can be bought from www.garrisongirls.com .

Does Michelle Obama need to lose weight? Does Michelle Obama need to lose weight? Now share your opinion . His four female co-hosts were all stunned by his outburst. ‘You did not just say that,' said Harris Faulkner. 'Oh, my goodness. Are we on a seven-second delay?' But Dr. Ablow was on a role. 'I want nutrition,' he continued, 'but let's be honest, there's no french fries happening? It's all kale and carrots? I don't buy it. Just saying.' At one point co-anchor Kennedy interjected to say that she like Mrs. Obama's figure. 'I like her booty,' she said. Disappointed that no one else would agree with him, Ablow could be heard to say 'Join me in my criticism.' Co-host Sandra Smith refused to get drawn in. 'Fitness of the First Lady aside, her presentation aside, I have no comments on that,' she said. The first lady is 5 foot 11 and is estimated to weight 170 pounds, which means her BMI is 23.7 and is therefore within the normal weight category. Ablow's four female co-hosts were all stunned by his outburst. ''You did not just say that,' said Harris Faulkner. 'Oh, my goodness. Are we on a seven-second delay?' Who needs to lose weight more - Michelle Obama or Fox News doctor? Who needs to lose weight more - Michelle Obama or Fox News doctor? Now share your opinion . Ablow then attempted to backtrack by adding that perhaps the President would be a better source of nutrition advice because he is skinny. His outburst drew the ire of fellow Fox News presenter and meteorologist Janice Dean, reports Mediaite. ‘Dear @KeithAblow please keep your comments about women ‘dropping a few’ to yourself. Sincerely, all women.' she tweeted, before later deleting. Fox regular Ablow is no stranger to controversy. In April 2011, Ablow wrote a health column for FoxNews.com criticizing designer Jenna Lyons for publishing an advertisement in the J. Crew catalog in which she was depicted painting her young son's toenails hot pink.

Ablow wrote that gender distinctions are 'part of the magnificent synergy that creates and sustains the human race.' Then during the 2012 Republican primary, he wrote a column arguing that Newt Gingrich's three marriages actually made him more qualified to be president. 'When three women want to sign on for life with a man who is now running for president, I worry more about whether we’ll be clamoring for a third Gingrich term, not whether we’ll want to let him go after one,' he wrote.

"Britain's technology industry is growing faster than Silicon Valley with London becoming a 'digital powerhouse' of the sector, which will pump £12billion into the economy over the next decade. Two separate studies have shown the importance of the capital in the digital world as London prepares to welcome more than 30,000 investors and developers to the first ever London Technology Week, which takes place at various venues across the city. Digital big hitters such as Microsoft, Google and Samsung are set to attend the event alongside homegrown successes such as Mind Candy and SpareRoom. Scroll down for video . The Old Street roundabout in London, nicknamed the Silicon roundabout in the centre of the area dubbed Tech City . To coincide with the launch of the week, research by Oxford Economics has predicted that London's tech sector will deliver 46,000 jobs and a £12billion boost to the economy by 2024. Meanwhile, a separate study by South Mountain Economics has found that the technology industry in London, the south-east and east of England is growing at a faster rate than Silicon Valley. Their analysis also showed that London is a world leader in financial technology, employing more workers in the sector than New York City and San Francisco. Twitter . Netflix . Microsoft . Yahoo .

Firms that started out there before being bought up by larger companies include social media management tool TweetDeck and music recommendation system Last.fm. Current successful businesses located in Tech City include Mind Candy, the firm behind the Moshi Monsters craze and Hassle.com, which allows customers to book local cleaners for their home or business. In comparison, Silicon Valley in the Santa Clara Valley close to San Francisco Bay is home to some of the biggest technology firms in the world, including Apple, Google and Facebook. The term Silicon Valley was first coined in 1971 and became widely used in the 1980s, with Silicon referring to the material used to make semi-conductors in computers. Research has found that half of the most inventive towns in America are in Silicon Valley in terms of utility patents filed.

'You've seen a number of retailers pull forward their events … and you're seeing a lot of activity, which tells me [this holiday event] is going to be very competitive,' Mac Naughton said . ABC News reports that another reason retailers are expanding Black Friday sale events is because customers are using smartphones and other devices to compare prices before they go to check out the deals in stores.

"A Draft from the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA) may require porn actors to use condoms on shoots--not too surprising for an industry laden with STIs. A bill called AB640, which requires condoms on porn shoots by law, is currently stalled in the Senate. However, the new 21-page draft may also require actors to have sex during porn while wearing safety goggles. The OSHA claims goggles will avoid semen from entering the eyes, a body part susceptible to diseases such as HIV and Chlamydia. Safety goggles may be required on porn sets to prevent actors from getting STIs . Salon reports that according to OSHA's deputy chief of health Deborah Gold, barrier methods such as condoms and eye protection are already technically required on porn shoots. Few porn companies adhere to those standards. If the new guidelines are deemed mandatory, there may be a trial period in which actors can ditch the 'barrier method' during oral sex. The safety rules would be reconsidered again in 2018 and either kept or discontinued. Slate reports that Wicked Pictures is the only mainstream porn production company that requires condom use during anal and vaginal intercourse. Deborah Gold of OSHA claims that condoms are technically already mandatory on porn sets but that almost no one adheres to the rules . Porn insiders are not thrilled with the new safety laws and some think the draft regulations are trying to rid the porn industry all together. Peter Ackworth, CEO of the fetish site Kink.com told Salon that the draft regulations 'basically criminalize the production of porn.' He even told Salon that he's thinking of selling Kink's San Francisco porn palace named the Armory. He said he'd 'have to invest in a warehouse in Nevada or Europe,' to produce his porns. Unfortunately, porns that use protective barrier methods during sex don't sell as well as porns that don't. One porn actress Lily Lebeau told Slate, I wouldn't mind using condoms more. It's just not what people want to see.' The porn industry started using condoms more after a 2004 HIV outbreak, but after porn sales went down, condoms came off, reported ABC. The Huffington post reports that The Free Speech Coalition, a trade group representing the adult film industry, is opposed to laws requiring condom use because it may stop required STI testing for actors. Actors currently test every 28 days or more. While the draft guidelines don't require regular testing, they do require that employers provide hepatitis B, hepatitis A, and HPV vaccinations to actors. The guidelines also require that studios, 'provide for post exposure prophylaxis' and that they provide counseling. Some porn actors are forced to pay for their own testing so the new law may alleviate some financial strain and force companies to take responsibility for their talent's health. The draft also says that porn shoots will have to instill new post shoot clean-up . requirements such as disposable materials and plastic coverings. On the one hand, the new law promotes health and safety to workers put in health-threatening conditions. On the other hand, the porn industry in California may die out all together.","A bill requiring condoms during porn shoots is currently being stalled in the Senate .

"Against all the odds, Esme is now eight . months old - although she is still battling lung and feeding . complications because of her early birth . A baby has astounded doctors by surviving despite being born four months premature and weighing just 1lb 6oz. Esme Poulsom was given just a one per cent chance of survival when mother Kirsty Barrett's waters broke after just 19 weeks. But Ms Barrett, 24, and partner Gareth Poulsom refused to give up hope and Esme was born so small she could fit into her mother's hand. Baby Esme (pictured with sister Ava, 2, father Gareth Poulsom, 27, and mother Kirsty Barrett, 24) has defied doctors to survive despite being born four months prematurely . Esme was so fragile and Ms Barrett was so ill after the birth that she was not allowed to see her new baby for two agonising days. Doctors warned the couple that the first weeks of Esme's life were 'touch and go' and she may not survive. But against the odds, Esme is now eight months old - although she is still battling lung and feeding complications because of her early birth. Ms Barrett and Mr Poulsom, who also have a two year-old daughter Ava, are also preparing a formal complaint against health chiefs over the handling of her Esme's care. Esme was given just a one per cent chance of life when Kirsty Barrett's waters broke after just 19 weeks. But Kirsty, 24, and partner Gareth Poulsom refused to give up hope . Four days after Ms Barrett's waters broke doctors at Nevill Hall Hospital in Abergavenny, Gwent told her she would either miscarry or give birth within 48 hours. Neither happened and her labour calmed but doctors warned there was no chance of the baby surviving without waters . They claim medics at one hospital 'gave up' on Esme even before she was born and have since failed to properly address her ongoing problems. Esme's remarkable story began last November when Ms Barrett went into labour just 19 weeks into her pregnancy. Four days later her waters broke and Ms Barrett said doctors at Nevill Hall Hospital in Abergavenny, Gwent told her she would either miscarry or give birth within 48 hours. Neither happened and her labour . calmed but doctors warned there was no chance of the baby surviving . without waters and said the pregnancy would stop developing normally. They recommended an abortion but Ms Barrett and Mr Poulson refused and decided to let nature take its course. They recommended an abortion but Kirsty and Gareth refused and decided to let nature take its course . Two week after her waters broke - and still having contractions - Ms Barrett was discharged. She said: 'I was told at Nevill Hall that if I got to 23 weeks I could have steroids to stop the contractions but when I reached 23 weeks I was told I couldn't have them' Two weeks after Ms Barrett's waters broke - and still having periodic contractions - she was discharged and put herself on bed rest at home in Pontypool, Gwent. She said: 'I was told at Nevill Hall that if I got to 23 weeks I could have steroids to stop the contractions and help viability at around 24 weeks. 'But when I reached 23 weeks I was told they wouldn't give me steroids because they felt I would miscarry. 'It felt like they had given up.' Ms Barrett knew of someone at the Royal Gwent Hospital in nearby Newport who had been given steroids in a similar situation. Mr Poulson contacted them and a doctor agreed to take over his partner's care if she could get transferred. Ms Barrett knew of someone at the Royal Gwent Hospital in nearby Newport who had been given steroids in a similar situation. Gareth contacted them and a doctor agreed to take over her care if she could get transferred. Within 20 minutes of the transfer Kirsty was given a steroid injection . Ms Barrett claims that Nevill Hall initially refused to the transfer, saying Ms Barrett was in active labour but they relented after agreeing that the baby's head was not engaged. Within 20 minutes of getting there Ms Barrett was given a steroid injection. She added: 'Looking back, I can't believe two hospitals in the same area could have such a different approach.' A . week later the mother developed blood poisoning and had to have a . Caesarian section and Esme was born on December 18 - four months ahead . of her due date of April 7. Ms Barrett recalled: 'They didn't think Esme would survive because she'd had no waters for five weeks. Ms Barrett (pictured with Esme) added: 'Looking back, I can't believe two hospitals in the same area could have such a different approach. A week later she developed blood poisoning and had to have a caesarian section and Esme was born on December 18 - four months ahead of her due date of April 7 . 'There was a one per cent chance. They thought they would give her to us and she would pass away. But she . was born crying. They couldn't believe it. 'She was so tiny and for the first couple of days Gareth brought me pictures because I couldn't see her. 'It . was touch and go and we were warned that sometimes there are two weeks . or so when things seem to go well, but then they can go downhill. But . she didn't.' Instead Esme kept improving, and after eight weeks was transferred back to Nevill Hall and put in the special care baby unit. Ms Barrett said 'They thought she would pass away. For the first couple of days Gareth (pictured) brought me pictures because I couldn't see her'. It was touch and go and we were warned that sometimes there are two weeks or so when things seem to go well, but then they can go downhill. But she didn't.' But it was then that the first problems emerged with her lungs which medics allegedly down-played.Esme began bottle feeding but her mother feared she was taking milk into her lungs. Despite her concerns the hospital discharged her after 100 days - with her baby still choking and coughing while feeding. Ms . Barrett said: 'She was getting worse. One day, going to Nevill Hall, . she stopped breathing in the car. I had to resuscitate her. 'They told us it was bronchiolitis, . that she'd caught a bug. She seemed to pick up on antibiotics. I said I . was concerned again about aspiration, they said again it was a bug.' Esme stopped breathing a second time and Gareth had to resuscitate her. Kirsty again repeated her concerns about her taking milk into her lungs, but says she was again told the baby had an infection. Instead Esme kept improving, and after eight weeks was transferred back to Nevill Hall and put in the special care baby unit . But Esme's condition worsened and she was transferred to specialists at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff. Kirsty said: 'One of her lungs had collapsed. She was very poorly, and they prepared us for the worst.' But once more Esme defied the odds and was returned home via Nevill Hall. 'A couple of weeks later we had a phone call from UHW asking how she was,' said Ms Barrett. 'We went down there and they were quite shocked at the state of her lung. It was still partly collapsed. Fighter: Esme (pictured with her mother, father and big sister) is now doing well although she is still battling lung and feeding complications because of her early birth . 'They asked if I had any concerns and I said I thought she was aspirating - taking milk into her lungs. They tested her and stopped the bottle feeding straightaway.' Esme was admitted and attempts were made to reinflate her lung. They were only partially successful and problems remain with her swallowing mechanism, and she may eventually require a feeding tube to be fitted into her stomach. Ms Barrett said: 'We don't know if her lung will fully reflate. If my concerns had been listened to at the beginning, this could have been avoided.' Ms Barrett and Mr Poulson are now preparing a complaint to the Aneurin Bevan Health Board over the handling of Esme's case. MailOnline has approached the Health Board for comment.","Esme Poulsom was given just a one per cent chance of survival when her mother Kirsty Barrett's waters broke after just 19 weeks .

"Under fire: UKIP member Godfrey Bloom was recorded suggesting countries receiving foreign aid sue it to buy 'sunglasses' and 'apartments in Paris' UKIP politician Godfrey Bloom . attempted to put a lid on the row triggered by his attack on foreign . aid, issuing a half-hearted apology for complaining about money being . sent to ‘bongo bongo land’. The outspoken MEP suggested foreigners used aid to ‘buy Ray-Ban sunglasses’ and ‘apartments in Paris’. In a speech to activists in Birmingham . last month he also complained about Pakistan buying ‘a new squadron of . F18s’ with British money. As a political storm grew over the remarks, he initially remained defiant. He insisted he was standing up for . 'ordinary people' and claimed only people in the ‘Westminster bubble’ would think referring to bongo bongo land it was racist. But UKIP leader Nigel Farage ordered him to issue an apology. In a carefully-worded statement Mr . Bloom said: ‘At a public speech in the West Midlands in early July, I . used a term which I subsequently gather under certain circumstances . could be interpreted as pejorative to individuals and possibly cause . offence.’ He went on: ‘Although quite clearly no . such personal usage was intended, I understand from UKIP party chairman . Steve Crowther and leader Nigel Farage that I must not use the . terminology in the future, nor will I and sincerely regret any genuine . offence which might have been caused or embarrassment to my colleagues.’ In the recording leaked to The . Guardian Mr Bloom was heard saying: ‘How we can possibly be giving a . billion pounds a month when we’re in this sort of debt to bongo bongo . land is completely beyond me. ‘To buy Ray-Ban sunglasses, apartments . in Paris, Ferraris and all the rest of it that goes with most of the . foreign aid. F18s for Pakistan. 'We need a new squadron of F18s. Who’s got the squadrons? Pakistan, where we send the money.’ The phrase 'bongo bongo land' was controversially used by former Tory minister Alan Clark to refer to Africa in the 1980s. Writing on Twitter, Mr Farage said: 'Godfrey 100% right over foreign aid budget but pleased he's apologised over the wrong language he used.' During a series of interviews . defending his remarks today, Mr Bloom said people in Yorkshire would not . think the term 'bongo bongo land' was racist because there is no such . country. Asked why he used the term when the . majority of people would think of it as racist, he told Sky News: 'No, . they wouldn't. They might in your Westminster bubble, your little world . of Westminster, but out here in Hull and Yorkshire, where we tell it . like it is, they don't feel it's racist at all. Godfrey Bloom's use of the phrase 'bongo bongo' is not the first time his outspoken style has landed him in trouble, nor is it the most controversial. A former economist, he was elected as an MEP in 2004 and has been making headlines ever since with his views on women, climate change and Germans. Soon after the Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire MEP was appointed to the European Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality he declared that 'no self-respecting small businessman with a brain in the right place would ever employ a lady of child-bearing age'. He added that he wanted to deal with women's issues because: 'I just don't think they clean behind the fridge enough.' On climate change he once remarked: 'As far as I am concerned man-made global warming is nothing more than a hypothesis that hasn't got any basis in fact.' The bowler-hat wearing 63-year-old also admitted visiting brothels and argued that instead of being exploited most prostitutes 'do it because they want to'. In 2010 he was ejected from a Brussels debate after using the Nazi slogan 'Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer' to insult German social democrat Martin Shulz. 'How can you get yourself into such a . state about something which doesn't even exist? There is no such country . so how can anyone be offended?' Asked what he would do if he was reprimanded, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I'd say ""Righto, sorry, sorry everybody"". 'If I've offended anybody in bongo . bongo land I shall write to the ambassador at the Court of St James's . and apologise to him personally.' The UKIP leadership believes Mr Bloom . was right to speak out about the amount of money Britain spends overseas . – equivalent to 0.7 per cent of GDP – but feared the row risked . tarnishing the party’s image. UKIP chairman Steve Crowther said: 'We . are asking Godfrey not to use this phrase again as it might be . considered disparaging by members from other countries. 'However, foreign aid is an extremely important debate that needs wider discussion.' Mr Bloom's remarks emerged in the week . his party is due to publish its list of approved candidates for next . year’s European elections – at which the party hopes to get the biggest . share of the vote. Two months ago UKIP leader Nigel . Farage ensured an Italian MEP was expelled from UKIP’s European alliance . for saying a black minister in Italy was part of a ‘government of bongo . bongo’ who would want to impose ‘tribal traditions’, and would be . better suited as a housekeeper. Mr Bloom denied the phrase carried any . suggestion of racism and stood by his comments, saying: ‘What’s wrong . with that? I’m not a wishy-washy Tory. ‘I don’t do political correctness... The fact that the Guardian is reporting this will probably double my . vote in the north of England.’ Today he went further, accusing David . Cameron of 'treason' for giving taxpayers' money to charities working . overseas while inflicting cuts at home. He said: 'What I am suggesting is when . a country has £1 trillion of debt and we're cutting our hospitals, our . police force and we are destroying our defence services, that the money . should stay at home and people who want to give money to worthwhile . charities. 'What I would argue is that is for the . individual citizens not for the likes of David Cameron to pick our . pockets and send money to charities of his choice. 'If I want to send money to charity, I will do it of my own accord, thank you. 'If you're fed up with £1 billion a . month going abroad with no audit trail when we're cutting our police and . hospitals, vote for me. If you don't believe that's (aid) treason - . treason, I use the word advisedly - that's how I feel. That's it.' Discipline: UKIP leader Nigel Farage ordered Mr Bloom to apologise and banned him from using the phrase 'bongo bongo land' again . In another part of the recording . filmed at a meeting in Wordsley, near Stourbridge, West Midlands, Mr . Bloom says in reference to a ruling from the European Court of Human . Rights: ‘You can torture people to death but you jolly well can’t give . them a full life sentence because that’s against their human rights. We . can’t hang them because we’re now a member of the European Union and . it’s embedded in the treaty of Rome. ‘It’s a personal thing but I’d hang the b****** myself.’ Mr Bloom’s remarks caused outrage among many MPs and campaigners. Rushanara Ali, a Labour development . spokesman, said: ‘If Nigel Farage is serious about getting rid of racism . and intolerance in his party, he should take action against politicians . who think it’s acceptable to speak of people in developing countries in . that way.’ Controversy: Former Tory minister Alan Clark used the term 'bongo bongo' in 1985 . John Mann, Labour MP for Bassetlaw, said UKIP should ‘throw him out and stop him standing as an MEP’. A spokesman for the anti-racism Hope . Not Hate campaign said Mr Bloom’s remarks were reminiscent of the ‘Tory . party of 1985’, when Alan Clark, former MP for Kensington and Chelsea, . provoked outrage by referring to Africa as ‘bongo bongo land’ in an . official meeting. Laura Pidcock, from campaign group . Show Racism the Red Card, said: 'What I can tell you is that in the . classrooms that I visit as an anti-racism education worker, these crude . stereotypes that see Britain as a civilised place and overseas as tribal . is an extremely homogenising sentiment and I think it's incredibly . damaging. 'Actually he needs to understand that . it is highly offensive and what he meant by it isn't important - it's . the outcome that's important,' she told the BBC. Mr Bloom has previously caused controversy over comments he made about women. The Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire . MEP was criticised for asking why businesses would ever hire ‘a lady of . child-bearing age’ and once joked that he wanted to get involved in . women’s rights issues because ‘I just don’t think they clean behind the . fridge enough’. In April a leaked email from Mr Bloom . suggested he was concerned about excessive 'political correctness' among . new recruits to UKIP. He also complained that forging UKIP's . policy platform was like 'herding cats' and suggested the party could . buy its policies 'off the shelf' from think-tanks. Earlier this week Tory strategist Lynton Crosby was accused of planning a campaign to expose UKIP members as ‘extremists’. It was suggested he wanted to launch a . ‘below-the-radar’ operation to undermine UKIP politicians by catching . them making embarrassing comments. This was denied by the Tories.","Godfrey Bloom rebuked by party for comments at meeting with supporters .

"A student has made the unconventional decision to fund her entire law degree by stripping - and has even persuaded her fans to stump up for all of her textbooks. Vanessa Knowles, 25, has been posing semi-nude for 'lads’ mags', webcams and websites since the age of 18. Two years ago, she decided to enroll on a law course and continue stripping part-time to fund her education. Vanessa spends almost as many hours per week chatting to her fans online (right) in her underwear as she does studying for her law degree (left), managing to fund her university course in full . The future lawyer pockets up to £50,000 a year, with her fans splashing out £2,000 for legal textbooks . She is now set to graduate with a first-class degree from a London university. While other students are taking out loans or forced to survive on Pot Noodles, Vanessa studies from her central London apartment, orders shopping from Ocado and has paid her £14,000 course fees in full. Her luxury lifestyle is all thanks to her legion of admirers. When the 34DD model isn’t studying in the library, she spends her time chatting with her 22,000 fans over a webcam. Online admirers dish out hundreds of pounds to chat with Vanessa, who poses topless in revealing lingerie. And although the legal world might frown upon her sideline, it has enabled her to pocket up to £50,000 a year, with her fans even splashing out £2000 for legal textbooks. She says: 'Doing a law degree is the biggest challenge I could have taken on, and I’ve wanted to become a lawyer since I was a little girl. 'I know the legal industry is conservative - but doing my adult work shouldn’t stop me from being a great lawyer.

'If I mention something I need for my degree on Twitter then ten minutes later someone has brought it for me. 'They’ve got me so much stationery that I’ve kitted out a home office, and I’m always dressed in designer labels for my work placements.' The topless model moved to London in 2012, and soon made a name for herself around campus, juggling 16 hours of weekly lectures and classes with her webcam work. Vanessa, who is currently single, devotes up to 12 hours a week to her fans. She says: 'I’ve become an internet personality and fans can get pushy trying to meet up with me. 'They have a perception of me as this sexy fantasy and think they can demand my time - they even get upset if I don’t reply to their messages straight away. Vanessa wants to do a legal practice course after graduating, before starting a full-time career in intellectual property law . 'During the first weeks of university some girls on my course Googled me and after they discovered my pictures, they tried to discredit my reputation. 'They looked at my accounts and were laughing at me - but I don’t care, I’m going to graduate with a first and make the most of university, no matter what they say. 'Some of my lecturers know what I do and make cheeky jokes. 'One lecturer asked if I was topless model, and another wanted to know where the girl with the ‘big boobs’ was when I missed class one day.' Vanessa first turned to stripping after a friend from popular lap-dancing chain Spearmint Rhino set her up with photo-shoots for men's magazines. Vanessa says she sees no reason why her work in the adult industry should hinder her becoming a lawyer . The model, then 18, posed for Loaded and, despite gaining 11 GCSEs and a dance diploma at college, decided she was having too much fun modelling to go to university straight after school. She says: 'I understand that people might think it’s degrading selling my body for money, but when I was dancing I felt totally in control. Vanessa began stripping after a friend from popular lap-dancing chain Spearmint Rhino organised for her to model for Loaded magazine . 'I was making four-figure sums every night lap-dancing in my home-town of Leeds, and I didn’t think about going to university. 'My . boyfriend at the time did get jealous, and sometimes I felt guilty - . but I’ve always drawn the line at doing anything hardcore. 'My dad passed away before I started dancing, and I don’t think he would have been too pleased - but my mum, Ann-Marie, has never worried about me - she knows I respect myself.' Soon she was splashing out on designer labels, convertible cars and she was jetting off to spend her summers in Ibiza and the US. At one time, Vanessa worked for nine months straight - before spending her earnings on a three-month holiday to the Greek Islands. She says: 'I loved dancing but there were days when it got so boring. 'I saw the same guys, day-in, day-out, and I’d had enough holidays to last me a lifetime. 'My three older sisters have all gone to university and I wanted people to be impressed by more than just my breasts. 'My lap-dancing and webcam work were already teaching me transferable legal skills. 'I was already playing hard ball and negotiating fees with customers, and some guys were saying they felt intimidated by intelligence.

She says: 'I’ve had some great placements with top law firms, but once I mistakenly emailed an important firm from one of my topless accounts. 'Luckily they didn’t notice, but I was so embarrassed, and it’s always in the back of my mind that doing this might affect my legal career.

"Tracey Cox says her work running a sex question-and-answer forum for men revealed their never ending obsession with size . The results of an Australian study on male body image this week showed men are more concerned about how they measure up against their friends than they are what their partner thinks of their penis size. The online study of 738 men found size mattered more in the gym changing room than it did in bed. The obvious conclusions to draw from this are that women are kinder than men about ‘delicate’ issues and the much touted ‘size doesn’t matter to women’ really is true. This month anyway. In April, another study (this time based on the views of 105 Australian women) told us women rate tall men with long penises as the most attractive when asked to view computer generated images of male bodies with varying heights, body shapes and penis lengths. Which surely means penis size is important to us. Quite frankly, I don’t find the results of either survey believable or helpful. In my 20-odd years of interviewing men about sexual attitudes and experiences and analysing research on the same, I’ve found penis size and performance remains top of the list of What Men Worry About. I absolutely buy that men worry what friends will think if put in a situation where comparisons are made. But I also think most men worry what their partners think as well. I’d like to think the research is true and men really have finally got that penis size isn’t important in bed. But I doubt it. Up until last year, I hosted an online clinic for men where they got to ask me anonymous questions about anything at all - sex, relationship, life, love - that bothered them. On Monday nights, I’d dutifully log on for five hours and for the two year period the clinic ran, answered the same three questions over and over: . Am I big enough? Why can’t I last longer? Why isn’t my erection instant, rock hard and bullet proof? 'Women care more about the man attached to the penis than the penis itself' says Tracey . In each instance, I’d patiently seek to reassure with the facts: . Only 30 percent of women can orgasm purely through penile penetration, so the size of your penis is not as important as tongue or finger skills. Most of the nerves of the vagina are concentrated in the first inch or so and it balloons when aroused, so if you want to be paranoid about anything, it’s width not length that’s more important. The size of a man’s penis flaccid, is not a reliable indicator of penis size. The guy who’s a ‘shower’ often won’t show much of an increase in size when erect while ‘growers’ increase dramatically. I found it bewildering and upsetting that most of the men refused to be reassured and stubbornly clung to the myth that unless their penis was large and hard whenever they wanted it to be, their partner would be so disappointed, she’d either seek sex elsewhere or leave him. The size of a man's penis flaccid, is not a reliable indicator of penis size . 'She won’t, you know,' I’d type sadly, knowing it wouldn’t be believed. 'Women care more about the man attached to the penis than the penis itself.' Which brings me to the second survey result: that women find tall men with long penises the most attractive. These women looked at 53 computer-generated, robot-like pictures which rotated so they were visible at different angles. Height, (flaccid) penis size and body shapes all varied. Tall men with broad shoulders and larger penises won - but this isn’t ‘proof’ that women are as hung up on penis size as men are. In the real world, we have sex with humans not robots and sexual attractiveness is based on much more than just looks - yet that’s all these women were asked to rate ‘attractiveness’ on. It’s the guy with a sense of humour, who’s kind and loves us and treats us well that’s going to get and keep the girl. Not the tall bloke with the big one. A big penis doesn’t ever top the ‘Things I want from my partner’ list and not all research is interpreted accurately.

"A film due to be screened at the 9/11 Memorial Museum has been blasted by a prominent Muslim cleric who claims it will 'greatly offend' Islam. Sheik Mostafa Elazabawy, the imam of Masjid Manhattan, said the seven-minute documentary, which is designed to explain to visitors the historical roots of the terrorist attacks, may confuse viewers about the difference between Al Qaeda and Muslims. The film, The Rise of Al Qaeda, refers to the terrorists as Islamists who viewed their mission as a jihad. Sheikh Mostafa Elazabawy, second from left, the imam of Masjid Manhattan, at his mosque in New York this week. He said a film due to be screened at the 9/11 Memorial Museum will 'greatly offend' Islam . Narrated by NBC news anchor Brian Williams, the film was shown to an interfaith advisory panel, which included Elazabawy. The panel asked for changes, but the museum declined and Elazabawy immediately resigned in March. He has written a letter to the museum's director: . 'The screening of this film in its present state would greatly offend our local Muslim believers as well as any foreign Muslim visitor to the museum.' The film was narrated by NBC news anchor Brian . Williams left. It will be shown, right, at the memorial museum, which . will be beneath the World Trade Center plaza, is set to open on May 21 .

'Unsophisticated . visitors who do not understand the difference between Al Qaeda and . Muslims may come away with a prejudiced view of Islam, leading to . antagonism and even confrontation toward Muslim believers near the site' Elazabawy wrote in his letter obtained by The New York Times. In . some scenes of the film the translations are voiced over by someone . with a foreign accent - a decision the interfaith group bill as . sensationalist. Reverend Ruth Yoder Wenger, of New York Disaster Interfaith Services told CNN: . 'We're concerned that the way this story is told equates Muslims in . general with al Qaeda, and that people coming away from viewing the . video will make that same association in their minds.' Sheik Mostafa Elazabawy is the imam of Masjid Manhattan and said 'the screening of this film in its present state would greatly offend our local Muslim believers as well as any foreign Muslim visitor to the museum' But museum . officials are standing by the film which focuses on a 15-year span . between Al Qaeda’s founding during the Soviet-Afghan War and the 9/11 . attacks. 'We . have a very heavy responsibility to be true to the facts, to be . objective, and in no way smear an entire religion when we are talking . about a terrorist group,' Joseph Daniels, president of the nonprofit . foundation that is overseeing the museum, told The New York Times. Michael .

"A woman who fell behind on  her yard work was sent to jail for not complying with city regulations regarding the maintenance of her overgrown lawn. Karen Holloway, from East Tennessee, was cited by Lenoir City officials in June for not keeping proper maintenance of her yard. She told WVLT-TV that while her yard was in dire need of attention and did look overgrown she did not think that it was a criminal offence. Shock: Karen Holloway said her busy schedule was the reason that her yard had become overgrown . Back yard: Holloway admits that her yard, seen here, was in dire need of attention and did look shabby . Citation: In July, she received a citation from the city stating that she had broken the law under Section 302.1 of the City of Lenoir City Property Code which requires all exterior property to be maintained . The mother-of-two said her busy schedule and other personal family issues were the reasons that her yard became overgrown. She said: 'With my husband going to school and working full time, me with my job, with one vehicle, we were trying our best. ‘[The bushes and trees] were overgrown. But that’s certainly not a criminal offense.’ In July, she received a citation from the city stating that she had broken the law under Section 302.1 of the City of Lenoir City Property Code which requires all exterior property to be maintained. It went on to suggest that she had not complied with the city's request for her to cut her grass under Section 302.4, which requires all grass to be cut to less than 12 inches. It meant Holloway faced jail, and on Tuesday, she turned herself in and made an appeal to city officials. Jail: On Tuesday, Holloway  turned herself in and made an appeal to city officials but it did not work . Grass: The city requests, under Section 302.4, that grass be cut to less than 12 inches . More time? Judge Vann has set up a follow-up hearing for Holloway in November to check on her  lawn . Judge Terry Vann initially handed her a five-day jail sentence, before amending it on Tuesday to just six hours. She said that she had offered to do five days of community service instead, but Vann refused her offer and said she should serve time behind bars. The judge admitted that she is not a criminal and it was not a criminal case - making Holloway believe that she was being used as an example. She said she felt 'bullied,’ and claims that she was not read her rights or told she could have a lawyer present. She said: ‘It’s not right, why would you put me in jail with child molesters and people who have done real crimes because I haven’t maintained my yard up to the city’s standards?’ ‘This opens a floodgate to everybody in Lenoir City being put in jail for silly things.’ Holloway said she has received several citations from the city  in the past while her husband was serving overseas in the military. But none of them turned out like this. Judge Vann has set up a follow-up hearing for Holloway scheduled for November to check on her progress and suggested that additional jail time may be added if the city is not satisfied with her lawn.","Karen Holloway, from East Tennessee, was cited by Lenoir City officials .

"Prince Philip put in a youthful appearance at the Royal Windosr Horse Show today despite his advancing age . He may be about to celebrate his 93rd birthday but Prince Philip clearly isn’t a man to slow down. The Iron Duke was out carriage driving yesterday in Windsor Great Park - with the energy of someone half his age. Like his wife, the Queen, who still rides regularly at the age of 88, Philip has refused to give up the sport he loves. He has always been a keen sportsman, taking up carriage driving in 1971 when he officially retired from playing polo - believing it was the perfect sport for someone in ‘middle age’. By 1973 he was suitably proficient to take up the sport competitively, representing Britain at several European and World Championships. He continued to compete in four-in-hand carriage driving with his team of Fell ponies into his early 80s and still enjoys the sport recreationally. In his book ‘Thirty Years On and Off The Box Seat’ the Duke described the appeal of the sport, saying: ‘I am getting old, my reactions are getting slower, and my memory is unreliable, but I have never lost the sheer pleasure of driving a team through the British countryside. ‘I have been fortunate to have had a longer innings than most, and I have no intention of giving up while I have a team of willing ponies and dedicated staff and while I can still cope with the challenges which carriage driving presents me with.’ Riding high: The Prince was seen driving around Windsor Great Park last week . Unstoppable: Royal aides have admitted it is difficult to persuade the prince to slow down . He took up carriage driving in 1971 after retiring from polo and competed in it from 1973 onwards . In 2010 he escaped major injury following a carriage driving accident - while a female groom less than half his age had to be taken to hospital. The prince was out driving in the grounds at Windsor Castle when the ponies pulling his carriage were startled and bolted. As a result the carriage hit a tree stump, jolting the occupants and leaving the Queen’s husband with ‘a minor injury’ to his ankle. Sources said he refused to see a doctor or go to hospital and by the afternoon of the same day was ‘out and about’ in the gardens again. Meanwhile the young female groom, who has not been named, was taken to hospital for an x-ray on an injury to her elbow. In 2010 the prince was nearly injured after the horses hitched to a carriage his was driving spooked and bolted . The accident ended with a female groom being taken to hospital, but Philip escaped with a 'minor ankle injury' and according to sources was back out in the gardens by the afternoon . In recent years, the prince has suffered several bouts of ill-health, however, the most serious of which was over Christmas 2011 when he was rushed into hospital for emergency heart surgery after suffering a blocked artery, which involved him having a stent fitted . He was also forced to pull out of several key engagements to celebrate the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee in 2012 having developed a severe bladder infection after being forced to stand for hours in driving wind and rain during a celebratory river pageant. He also spent his birthday - June 10 - last year in hospital after undergoing an ‘exploratory’ operation for unexplained abdominal pain. The results of the tests have never been released. Yet aides have admitted it is difficult to persuade Philip to slow down, with one saying: ‘No one would ever dare tell him to take it easy - you might as well take your life in your hands.’ ‘The Duke cannot bear anyone making a fuss. ‘ . Aides said Philip had been out and about in the days before the horse show speaking with stall owners . As well as taking a carriage for a spin, the prince was on hand to dish out awards, such as in the Driving for the Disabled class (pictured) Philip is already the longest-serving consort in British history and the oldest serving partner of a reigning monarch. In an interview to mark his 90th birthday with the BBC, the outspoken Duke said he favoured discrimination against older people as ‘you go downhill’ later in life. He also admitted he was reducing his own workload before he reaches his ‘sell-by date’. ‘There is an ageism in this country, as everywhere, and quite rightly so, because I think you go downhill - physically, mentally and everything,’ he said. ‘I reckon I’ve done my bit, I want to enjoy myself for a bit now. With less responsibility, less rushing about, less preparation, less trying to think of something to say.’ One royal aide said yesterday that Philip had been out and about at Windsor in recent days, helping the Queen to prepare for the annual Royal Windsor Horse Show. ‘The Duke is not competing but he is, as always, continuing to take great interest in the RWHS. He has been out and a about checking on the arrangements and meeting stallholders,’ they said.","Prince Philip, 92, attended the Royal Windsor Horse Show today .

On Thursday before he had official confirmation, Patrick McStay told the LA Times: 'I got a cold chill and I knew it was them.'

When they vanished along with their parents, Gianni was four (left) and Joseph Jr was three . Earlier this year, claims in an explosive, self-published book by an amateur sleuth revealed that Mrs McStay sent abusive emails to her husband in which she vowed: 'I will turn on you'. In ‘No Goodbyes: The Mysterious Disappearance of the McStay Family’, former radio show host Rick Baker argues that Joseph and Summer’s marriage was ‘doomed from the start’ and that she may have murdered her husband. Baker made the shocking allegations after conducting dozens of interviews over three years with friends and members of the McStay family. Baker became ‘obsessed’ with the case and has turned up hundreds of text messages and emails he claims have led him to believe that the seemingly-loving wife was living a double life. He told MailOnline in January that the emails depict Summer as ‘sick monster’ who plotted against her husband’s son from a previous marriage because she ‘hated him’. Reached by phone at the time the book was published, Joseph's brother Mike McStay told MailOnline: ‘The family have no comment’. But he has in the past spoken to CNN and condemned Baker's book. Of Baker himself, he said: 'I don't know how he sleeps at night. I suspect he's looking for money. He's a good manipulator and knows how to twist things. He's just trying to sell books.' Mike and Joseph's mother Blake added: 'It was very hard to read all this, very heartbreaking, the accusations. The bottom line for me is this book will bring focus to finding the family.'

"At least six senior staff at a scandal-hit animal charity signed gagging orders and received pay-offs totalling some £180,000 while their controversial former boss was in charge. Kim Hamilton quit as chief executive of Blue Cross last month after allegations she was involved in a love triangle revolving around a female assistant who later committed suicide. In an anonymous email sent to the charity’s board, employees expressed ‘deep concern’ over the situation that led to Miss Hamilton’s resignation from her £120,000-a-year post. Kim Hamilton quit as chief executive of Blue Cross last month after allegations she was involved in a love triangle with female assistant Mel Brown . Now whistleblowers have revealed that at least six former senior staff – including three directors – have left the charity after signing what are known as compromise agreements. These agreements have been criticised because they prevent them from discussing the reasons for their departure, and they lose the money they received if they do speak out. Last night critics said it was unacceptable for charities to use so-called gagging orders and called on the Blue Cross to spend its money caring for animals. Tory MP Charlie Elphicke said: ‘The behaviour of the Blue Cross has let down animals and the members of the public who have entrusted them with their hard-earned money. ‘The use of gagging clauses where public money is concerned is wholly unacceptable and wrong.’ Fellow Tory Priti Patel said: ‘Charities should behave in an open and transparent way. The prospect that they are silencing staff will concern their members and those who donate.’ Both MPs are members of the Public Administration Select Committee looking into charity pay. The Charity Commission said the use of compromise agreements was a matter for charities but ex-employees should not be prevented from raising concerns in the public interest. In 2012 Miss Hamilton, a 53-year-old former City trader, started a relationship with Melanie Brown, 27, an administrative assistant at the charity’s HQ in Burford, Oxfordshire. Mel Brown, 27, was found hanged at her flat in Cirencester last August . Six months later, bisexual Miss Brown ended the relationship and started seeing the charity’s head of fundraising, Mike Crossley, 52. He was later sacked from his £80,000-a-year job and was paid £60,000 to sign a gagging clause to stop him discussing the reasons. A source said at the time: ‘Kim told Mike he was in a relationship with a vulnerable person at work, and that it was inappropriate so he had to go. ‘His departure was a direct result of his relationship with Mel. It was an entirely personal thing. But how could it be inappropriate if Kim had also had a relationship with Mel?’ Last August Miss Brown was found hanged at her flat in Cirencester, Gloucestershire. An inquest will be held this year. There is no suggestion that her relationship with Miss Hamilton was in any way linked to her suicide. The situation prompted Blue Cross employees and volunteers to write to the board of directors to warn that the charity had ‘lost its way’. In their email they said they were writing anonymously because otherwise they feared dismissal due to the ‘culture of mistrust, blame and fear’ at the charity. They wrote: ‘We feel compelled to write to you out of deep concern for the charity, given the damage that has been done since Kim Hamilton took over as CEO in 2008. It feels as if Kim Hamilton brought the morally corrupt ethics of the banking sector with her when she joined Blue Cross. ‘What is most concerning to us is that the charity has lost its way – rather than putting animal welfare first, resources are wasted on ever increasing salaries and head office refurbishments.’ Blue Cross has an income of £31million a year and runs four animal hospitals and 12 rehoming centres managed by 650 employees. Zair Berry, chairman of Blue Cross, said that any decision to ask staff to leave under a confidential compromise agreement ‘is not taken lightly and only considered when it is in the best interests of Blue Cross. ‘As a charity, we do everything we can to ensure that Blue Cross funds are focused on helping pets.’","Kim Hamilton quit as chief executive of Blue Cross last month .

"More than 85 per cent of the 50,000 Australians surveyed in a recent poll, believe that marijuana should be legalised across the country. Conducted by SBS's Insight team, the poll reflects the current ongoing public debate which has seen federal politicians consider a medical trial. As public opinion tips in favour of legalising the drug, a variety of voices have come forward to have their say on the positives of cannabis use, from mothers and former policemen to psychologists. A national poll of over 50,000 people conducted by SBS has found that over 85 per cent of Australians believe  marijuana should be legalised . Cannabis researcher, Dr. Matthew Large from the University of New South Wales School of Psychiatry, told Daily Mail Australia that despite research showing the ill effects of the drug, he supports the movement to legalise it. 'My view is, with respect to medical cannabis, that there are no strong arguments against it,' Dr Large said. 'We have other drugs that are illegal that can be prescribed including opiate drugs, the illegal version of which is heroin and legal version morphine. There are also stimulant drugs that we use in the treatment of ADHD and sleep disorders that are illegal and so I can't see that there's a particular issue with cannabis. 'There are several not particularly common conditions for which cannabis is a good second line treatment for when the first line doesn't work: muscular spasticity in multiple sclerosis, neuropathic pain disorders and conditions in relation to people who have terminal conditions or difficulty eating.' However, the Sydney psychiatrist noted that 'there is no doubt that cannabis is a dangerous drug'. Cannabis researcher and psychologist Matthew Large supports the legalisation of medical marijuana as well as for recreational purposes as long as there is strong government regulation in place . Dr Large also acknowledged the health risks the drug presents for people with a predisposition for mental illness as well as teenagers, but said he believes government regulation will lead to a better educated public who are well informed enough to make decisions . Dr Large said that studies have shown that cannabis smokers who develop schizophrenia, do so about three years earlier than people with schizophrenia who don't use the drug. It also leads to a 'severer and more irreversible' form of the illness. Furthermore, he revealed that the drug is particularly harmful for people under the age of 16 who have a higher chance of educational failure and, in the long term, are more likely to suffer cognitive impairment and have a significant loss of IQ by the age of 50 if they use cannabis. 'What I would personally support would be if marijuana was legalised and carefully regulated in much the same way as tobacco, but not in the same way as alcohol,' Dr Large said. 'We have a drug that is illegal but widely used and about which the general populace has little information about and no way of making informed decisions about. Former police officer Damon Adams has been using cannabis for pain relief after a knee operation which left him with no cartilage at the joint. He was originally prescribed opiates but swapped to marijuana due to the severe side affects . 'In Australia at the moment, 14-year-olds are more likely to smoke cannabis than tobacco and that's because we have been putting out all these health warnings and information campaigns.' Former South Australian police officer, Damon Adams, has been using cannabis as a form of pain relief following a knee operation which left him with no cartilage at the joint. Mr Adams was first prescribed with opiates after the surgery, but the former Australian Navy member told Daily Mail Australia that 'opiates and my body weren't a good combination'. He soon found himself taking a number of anti-histamines to counter the side effects of the opiates, which included night sweats and constant itching. The final results of the national poll conducted by SBS Insight, which prompted voters with an interactive billboard in Sydney and Melbourne's CBD, will be revealed on Tuesday night at 8:30pm . 'It was instant relief,' Mr Adams said of the first time he resorted to cannabis instead of opiates. 'The pain was always there but cannabis gave me the ability to be able to move on and keep doing things. I had better sleep and wasn't sweating anymore – I was just healthier.' Like Dr Large, Mr Adams would like to see marijuana legalised for recreational use, as long as the government puts forward effective regulation. The final results of the national poll conducted by SBS Insight, which prompted voters through an interactive billboard placed in Sydney and Melbourne's CBD, will be revealed on Tuesday night at 8:30pm when Insight explores the use of medical marijuana. The billboard featured synthetic marijuana plants that 'grew' or 'died' depending on the results, according to SBS.

"New details have emerged about the final hours of President Kennedy’s life, including that he had sex with wife Jackie on Air Force One the day before his assassination 50 years ago. The information was divulged to historian William Manchester by Jackie Kennedy when he interviewed her in 1964. In his 1967 book, The Death Of A President, Manchester discretely referred to the intimacy as a ‘last hour of serenity,’ but he had always vowed not to divulge any further details while he was alive. New details have emerged about the final hours of President Kennedy¿s life, including that he had sex with wife Jackie on Air Force One the day before his assassination 50 years ago . The information has been made public now – the 50th anniversary of Kennedy’s assassination – by writer Philip Nobile who told the New York Post that Manchester had told him in the mid-1970s when he was researching an as-yet-unpublished book about JFK’s reputation as a Casanova. The two writers had met to discuss Kennedy in the mid-1970s when they both shared the same literary agent. Manchester told Nobile that Jackie had revealed to him that she and her husband had made love for the last time on Air Force One during the short flight from San Antonio to Houston on the afternoon of November 21, 1963, the day before her husband's assassination. Manchester admitted that in order to include the sensitive material in his own book, he had used euphemisms and avoided being explicit about what he knew. Touch down: The President and Jackie arrive at Dallas Airport on Air Force One after the short flight from San Antonio . In his 1967 book, Manchester wrote: ‘Their life together now had nearly a full day to run. Yet this was to be their last hour of serenity. The tyranny of events and exhaustion would begin to close in when they finished the two-hundred-mile lap to Houston. ‘Actually, they hadn’t even an hour. In this plane the hop took only forty-five minutes. Privacy was that limited, confined to a tiny blue cabin racing 30,000 feet above the tessellated green and brown plains of central Texas . . . Their time was up. The President emerged in a fresh shirt.’ Manchester asked Nobile not to attribute the intimate information to him, at least not while he was alive. The historian died in 2004. In spite of Manchester’s attempts to appease Jackie, she still strongly objected to several passages in The Death Of A President, calling them ‘tasteless and distorted.’ She sued him for breach of contract in 1966 and she and Bobby Kennedy gained final text approval of his book as part of the settlement. Manchester also agreed to lock up all research materials due to Jackie’s objections and return 10 hours of taped interviews to be sealed at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum. According to the legal settlement, the judgment remains 'in full force and effect until the expiration of 100 years' and so the public won’t see them until 2067. Jackie Kennedy strongly objected to several passages in William Manchester's The Death Of A President, calling them 'tasteless and distorted.'

"The woman behind Siri, Apple's friendly voice-activated virtual 'assistant,' has finally been revealed. Susan Bennett, a voice-over actor from suburban Atlanta, Georgia, laid down hours of nonsensical recordings for an unknown client eight years ago; little did she know, she would soon be speaking to more than 100million people once Siri was introduced with the iPhone 4S on October 4, 2011.

'There are some people that just can . read hour upon hour upon hour, and it's not a problem. For me, I get . extremely bored ... So I just take breaks. That's one of the reasons why . Siri might sometimes sound like she has a bit of an attitude,' Mrs Bennett told CNN. 'Those sounds might have been recorded the last 15 . minutes of those four hours.' While Apple won't confirm that Mrs Bennett is Siri, professionals who know her voice, including those who represents her legally, say she is Siri.

'I really had to weigh the importance of . it for me personally. I wasn't sure that I wanted that notoriety, and I . also wasn't sure where I stood legally,' she admitted. 'And so, consequently, I was . very conservative about it for a long time. And then this . Verge video came out ... And it seemed like everyone was clamoring to . find out who the real voice behind Siri is, and so I thought, well, you . know, what the heck? This is the time.' Siri, Apple's friendly voice-activated virtual 'assistant,' was introduced with the iPhone 4S on October 4, 2011 . Mrs Bennett fell into voice work by . accident in the Seventies. Today, she speaks in commercials and on . countless phone systems. She also spells out directions from GPS . devices, and greets travelers in Delta airport terminals. But in 2005, when ScanSoft, a . software company looking for a voice for a new project, asked Mrs . Bennett to sign a contract offering her voice for recordings that would . be used in a database to construct speech, she had no idea how her voice . would eventually be used. When Apple released its iPhone 4S, the first to feature Siri, Mrs Bennett was alerted to her familiar voice by friends and family. 'A colleague e-mailed me [about Siri] and said, ""Hey, we've been playing around with this new Apple phone. Isn't this you?""' So Mrs Bennett pulled up Apple's website and listened to video clips announcing Siri. 'It's obviously me. It's my voice,' she said. When her son, Cameron Bennett, a . photographer in Los Angeles, saw an iPhone 4S commercial on television, he said he was flummoxed seeing director Martin Scorsese talking to his mother. Then when Cameron . bought the phone himself, she began guiding him on its GPS . feature. 'Her voice has been everywhere . throughout my life. I'd call my bank while I was in college in Colorado, . and it was my mom telling me I had $4,' he said. So why won't Apple confirm Mrs Bennett as Siri's voice? Marcus Graham, CEO of GM Voices, which represents Mrs Bennett, says that 'companies are competing to create the best-sounding and functioning systems. When her son, Cameron Bennett, a photographer in Los Angeles, saw an iPhone 4S commercial on television, he said he was flummoxed seeing director Martin Scorsese talking to his mother. 'Their concern is driving revenues. Talking about the voice talent, from their perspective, is likely seen as a distraction.' Mrs Bennett's attorney, Steve Sidman, said that since he began representing her last year, he has 'engaged in substantial negotiations -- multiple, months-long negotiations -- with parties along the economic food chain, so to speak, that involved her rendering services as the voice of Siri.' And then there's Graham, of GM Voices, a man who has built a career around providing voice over talent for interactive voice technologies. Ed Primeau, a member of the American Board of Recorded Evidence from Michigan who has analyzed 'hundreds, if not thousands' of recordings in court hearings, said he spent four hours studying Siri and Mrs Bennett's voice. 'They are identical -- a 100per cent match, he said after creating back-to-back comparison files. And after asking a second opinion, for the 'importance of accuracy,' he said: 'Rest assured: It's 100% Susan.'","Susan Bennett, a voice-over actor from Atlanta, Georgia, recorded hundreds of phrases and sentences during July 2005 .

"The bank which bills itself as the 'world's local bank' has been accused of discrimination after shutting down accounts which belong to Syrian refugees and students living in the UK. HSBC reportedly sent letters to some Syrian clients giving them two months' notice to find a new bank due to 'assessments of the risk'. The move comes just weeks after HSBC warned it would close down the accounts of a number of UK-based Muslim organisations, including the mosque in Finsbury Park, London, where hate preacher Abu Hamza was based. HSBC has been accused of discrimination after closing down the bank accounts of Syrian refugees and students living in the UK . One charity has accused the bank of 'singling out' Syrian customers and treating them as 'second-class citizens'. But the bank told MailOnline that any move to close down certain accounts was not based on race or religion. It said all decisions were subject to 'thorough review' and were not made without good reason. Mohammad Isreb, who has banked with HSBC since 2006, is one customer who said his bank account was closed down. He has a Tier 1 UK visa - the category for highly skilled workers - and said he has not received or sent any money to Syria. He told The Independent: 'After I was sent a letter, I told HSBC that being a Syrian national is not a valid reason to cancel my account. I’ve not breached any laws. 'This is adding tremendous pressure on Syrians who are already in a difficult situation. This is stabbing Syrians in the back. The sanctions are against the Government, not the people of Syria.' Meanwhile, Majid Maghout, a 26-year old Syrian on a student visa, said his bank account was also closed down. He told the paper it was a case of 'discrimination'. The US, the EU, Turkey and the Arab League have imposed sanctions on Syria, which has seen many refugees leave the country since the start of the uprising in March 2011 . Human Rights group Refugee and Asylum Seeker Participatory Action Research (RAPAR) and the Syrian Rethink Rebuild Society have launched a joint campaign over the issue, saying Syrian nationals have been 'unfairly targeted' due to their nationality. They say they have 'uncovered a pattern of abuse on behalf of HSBC' in which the bank has turned down customers, closed accounts, or refused mortgages for customers because they are Syrian. The Finsbury Park Mosque, which was previously run by hate preacher Abu Hamza, was also sent a letter from HSBC saying its account would be closed . The charity said: 'HSBC has been singling out its Syrian customers in the UK, treating them as second-class customers and abusing its power over them as their financial providers.' The US, the EU, Turkey and the Arab League have imposed international financial sanctions on Syria. Since the uprising in the country in March 2011, many Syrians have been living in the UK on a temporary basis for study or work. Many had to apply for asylum and received . refugee status to avoid returning to the war-torn country. A spokesman for HSBC said: 'HSBC is committed to adopting and enforcing the most effective standards to combat financial crime across its operations globally. 'This includes ensuring we have appropriate policies for how we do business and with whom. This applies to customers with links to a country that is subject to international financial sanctions. 'In certain cases, an assessment of the risks involved may require ending a customer relationship. 'We do not discuss individual customers, nor do we confirm whether an individual or business is, or has been a customer, but decisions to end a customer relationship are not taken lightly, and are absolutely not based on the race or religion of a customer.' Last month, HSBC told the Finsbury Park Mosque and other Muslim organisations that their accounts would be closed in September. Khalid Oumar, trustee of Finsbury . Park mosque in north London, accused the bank of an 'Islamophobic . campaign' against Muslim organisations. The Ummah Welfare Trust, based in Bolton, and the Cordoba Foundation thinktank also received near-identical letters saying their services fell 'outside of our risk appetite'. A spokesman said race and religion were not factors which were taken into consideration when deciding to close a bank account.","Bank has given some Syrian clients two months' notice to find a new bank .

"The Red Sox paid an emotional tribute to the people of Boston this afternoon in a moving pregame ceremony at Fenway Park, the first time since last Monday's deadly terrorist attacks that killed three and left more than 180 wounded. Designated hitter David Ortiz exclaimed 'this is our f***ing city' to rapturous cheers, and some tears, after a moving video, encapsulating the horror and heroism of the past few days, played on the big screen. Proud Bostonians could be seen watching the game, many of them clutching American flags.

He continued: 'We want to thank you, Mayor Menino, Governor Patrick, the whole police department for the great job they did this past week. This is our f***ing city, and nobody is going to dictate our freedom. Stay strong.' The Boston team, rather than wearing their traditional 'Red Sox' embroidered across the chest, wore crisp white uniforms that simply read 'Boston,' with a 'B Strong' logo. The team said their uniforms would be autographed and auctioned to raise money for the charity established to help the victims, called One Fund Boston. During the video, the crowd applauded when images of the brave Carlos Arredondo appeared on the screens and it increased when pictures and quotations from President Obama, Governor Patrick and Mayor Menino were shown.

"A married couple who identify as polyamorists have opened up about their unconventional relationship, revealing how an active sex life boosts their mood and keeps them fit. Kamala Devi and Michael McClure, aged 38 and 49 respectively, swore off monogamy from day one. They have up to a dozen different lovers each - some to themselves and some who they share. Six months ago they welcomed 27-year-old bisexual Rachel Rickards into their home in San Diego, California, and now the three of them enjoy each other's company - and bodies. Scroll down for video . Polyamorous: Kamala Devi (right) and Michael McClure (center), have been married for 12 years but they both swore off monogamy - six months ago they welcomed 27-year-old Rachel Rickards (left) into their home . 'One of my favoroite things since we . all lived together is actually the fact that we do more exercise. It's . so improved my live,' Ms Devi told ABC News, while Mr McClure . interjected: 'And your butt.' They . say that Ms Rickards also provides a helping hand when it comes to . raising their six-year-old son, Devin. He was educated about his unusual . family set-up from a young age. Addressing concerns about how he might be effected by the situation Mr McClure said: 'He understands the word ""polyamory."" 'He understands what that means. He doesn't really know what sex is yet.' Extended family: Ms Devi and Mr McClure have a six-year-old son together called Devin . Unconventional arrangement: The couple share each other's company - and bodies with their live-in girlfriend Ms Rickards . 'He has so much love and he has so . many aunties and uncles,' Ms Devi also said in a previous interview, likening her lovers to family . members. Indeed, Devin appears to enjoy having 'two mothers' around the house. In one frame during the ABC News interview the youngster says: 'I'm so grateful for this loving family that lives here.' 'When he goes to school and in ten years brings dates home, this is probably going to be a little complicated for him' For those who maybe confused as to . what polyamory is, Dr Karen Stewart, a sex therapist in Los Angeles, . said: 'Polyamory is not about being swingers. It's not about the one-off . weekend with the couple we met at the bar. 'It's about forming long and lasting and loving relationships.' However, she admitted that Ms Devi and . Mr McClure's son might find their polyamorous relationship hard to . understand later in life, especially when he realizes that friends' situations are different. 'When he goes to school and in ten . years brings dates home, this is probably going to be a little . complicated for him,' she said. Video: Kamala Devi . Spreading the word: Ms Devi works full-time as a sex and relationship coach and has published books . Tangled web: While she is married to Mr McClure she also has a girlfriend of two years named Roxanne (left) Former lovers: Tahl Gruer and Jennifer Gold (center couple) who have been married for nine years and practicing polyamory for three, cohabited with Ms Devi and Mr McClure for two years . 'I'm not sure if the parents are thinking down the road about that.' But Ms Devi believes by the time Devin is a teenager polyamory will be 'a new paradigm'. 'It is quite normal already. It's just not out of the closet,' Mr McClure added. 'Polygamy is actually quite normal already. It's just not out of the closet yet' It was originally his decision to have Ms Rickards move in, after he met the pretty brunette on holiday. Ms . Devi, a full-time sex and relationship coach, approved the arrangement . because she saw her husband so 'happy' – not because she was worried . about losing him to a younger model. In . fact, she . had been dating another woman named Roxanne for two years anyway and . only saw it fair that Mr McClure pursued someone of interest too. Ms . Rickards, who also divides her time between two boyfriends and a . girlfriend, isn't the first person to have lived with Ms Devi and Mr . McClure. Two moms are better than one: Ms Devi says 'it takes a village to raise a child and it feels really good to have that kind of support' Tahl Gruer and Jennifer Gold, who have been married for nine years and practicing polyamory for three, cohabited with the couple for two years. During their time together the foursome enjoyed exploring meditation, yoga and Tantric sex. In one YouTube video, the four are seen cosied up on a sofa giving tips on how to have 'sizzling sex'. 'Polyamory is not about the one-off weekend with the couple we met at the bar. It's about forming lasting relationships' And . photos of them on Facebook show them partner swapping, with Mr Gruer . planting a kiss on Ms Devi's cheek in one shot and touching Mr McClure's . clothed thigh in another. Ms Devi and Mr McClure say the three rules they live by are, 'safe sex', 'no drama' and 'honesty'. 'That first rule is really about making sure that we've created the space to have the conversation,' Ms Devi explained. This kind of 'polyamorous' relationship is becoming increasingly common, experts say. Future ambition: The couple's (pictured center) aim is to continue growing their polyamorous community and 'potentially even get a hotel' ""The divorce rate in the United States is . over 50per cent. People are not staying nearly as faithful they . used to,' said Dr. Stewart. 'The . world has become a much smaller place. We can seek out connections, . there's dating sites on every street corner. You can go anywhere to meet . someone now.' Ms Devi and Mr McClure, who have been married for 12 years, say their aim is to continue growing their polyamorous community and 'potentially even get a hotel' where they can stay with all of their lovers combined.","Kamala Devi and Michael McClure, aged 38 and 49 respectively, have been married for 12 years but swore off monogamy from the start .

"Celebrity: John Wayne Bobbitt became a household name in 1993 when his wife Lorena cut off his penis. His celebrity status has resulted in him sleeping with around 70 women since . John Wayne Bobbitt suffered what was, to most men, the worst possible attack - having his penis sliced clean off. His prospects of surviving, let alone experiencing the joys of a fully-functioning manhood, looked incredibly bleak as he lost consciousness and began to lose vast quantities of blood. But shocking doctors and all who have followed the now infamous case, Mr Bobbitt, 46, went on to make a full recovery, has since slept with around 70 women - even worked as a porn star - and is now a devout Christian and hoping to marry for the third time. While he would not wish his horrific ordeal  - which still gives him nightmares 20 years after it happened - upon anybody, Mr Bobbitt cannot deny it has transformed his life. Speaking to The Sun, he said: 'The doctors told me I would never be able to have sex again because my injuries were so bad. But I've proved them wrong time and time again. I believe I've slept with 70 women since the incident.' He added: 'Being the most famous man to have his penis chopped off does have its advantages. It definitely has not hurt my love life - in fact it improved it.' It all began two decades ago, on June 23, 1993 -  a terrifying moment that will remain sealed in Mr Bobbitt's memories forever. He had been out drinking with friends in Virginia and came home to his then-wife Lorena. They started to row. A court later heard that she claimed he tried to rape her, but Mr Bobbitt was acquitted of this. After he fell asleep, Lorena went out to the kitchen and chose her weapon - an eight-inch knife. She then returned to the bedroom and sliced off his penis. In a rage, she jumped in the car and drove off, throwing the severed end out of the window. To this day, Mr Bobbitt still remembers the shuddering pain; he still dreams of the moment the cold knife carved through his penis until the last two-and-a-half inches were completely severed. Reunited: Mr Bobbitt was reunited with his former wife Lorena on U.S. tabloid show Insider in 2009. On the show he said he was hurt by the fact she never apologised . The former US Marine recalls seeing . torrents of blood gush from his groin before losing consciousness. He . next woke momentarily in hospital, about to enter surgery. Fortunately, . realising her error, Lorena had called the emergency services and a . painstaking search had found his penis in a field. Doctors . worked for 10 hours re-joining his detached penis, carefully stitching . together multiple nerve endings to give him the best possible chance of . regaining some feeling. After . the operation, they told him he would never be able to have sex again. He had a catheter for two months and it took two years for his penis to . fully heal, but incredibly, it was only three weeks after the op that he . began to feel a tingling sensation in his re-attached penis. He was so excited by it, he called his mother. It would be just three months after the surgery that Mr Bobbitt first had sex again, after meeting a girl in a bar. Frightened he wouldn't be able to perform, Mr Bobbitt was relieved to discover he was still capable of having sex; it 'wasn't 100 per cent, but we did OK,' he said. It didn't take long before Mr Bobbitt was making the most of his miracle penis, and became a global celebrity as a result. He appeared in various news media and radio shows, talking about his experience. Three years ago Mr Bobbitt appeared on The View to talk about his life 17 years on. He told the all-female panel that it was still hard to trust women . One radio show even offered to pay for him to undergo penis enlargement surgery, which Mr Bobbitt says he jumped at. The . second three-hour op added an extra two inches to the length and made . it thicker. Bursting with confidence, Mr Bobbitt went on to form a band . called The Severed Parts, moved to Las Vegas and starred in a number of . adult sex films, including one called Frankenpenis. His . celebrity lifestyle caught up with him however and he spiralled onto a . dark path. In 1994 Mr Bobbitt was jailed for 15 days for assaulting his . then-fiance Kristina Elliott. They never married. Trial: Mr Bobbitt's former wife Lorena, pictured during the 1993 trial. Years later Mr Bobbitt said she had clearly done it because she was 'heartbroken' He went on to marry two other women - a businesswoman in 2001 to whom he was wed for just 23 days; and a woman in 2002 who he was also accused of assaulting. This marriage ended after two years. Today, Mr Bobbitt insists his wayward life is all behind him; he has returned to his home town of Niagara Falls in New York; is a regular church-goer; makes a living as a carpenter and limo-driver and has finally found love. Marie Basile, 43, is a childhood friend; the two are planning to get hitched soon. He is also in the process of researching and writing a book on men who have suffered the same kind of attack. He says since 1836 until his case in 1993, he has found 19 documented cases of similar penis-severing attacks. Since his case, however, there have been 121 others - many of which have been copycat cases. But perhaps not all have had such fortunate outcomes. Mr Bobbitt told The Sun: 'Obviously I would have preferred not to go through all that pain and suffering. But being famous for my penis has given me opportunities I could not have ever imagined.'","John Wayne Bobbitt, 46, thought he would never be able to have sex again .

It connects wirelessly via Bluetooth with a user's phone allowing them to lock, unlock, weigh, locate and track the suitcase . Bluesmart is available for £120 ($195) now for early backers on Indiegogo and the team expects to begin shipping in August next year. It is 21.5” x 14” x 9 inches (54.6 x 35.6 x 22.9cm) in size - approved by all airlines to carry on - and weighs 8.5lbs (3.8kg) Digital Lock: Users can lock and unlock the suitcase from the phone app. The proximity sensors automatically lock the bag when it is separated from the user. Digital Scale: Users are able to see the exact weight of the suitcases on the app and whether it’s approved by the airline to carry on. Distance Alerts: Users are notified on their smartphones via SMS when they are leaving their suitcases behind, avoiding losses or thefts. Location Tracking: With GPS technology Bluesmart tracks the location of the suitcase and helps you find it when lost or re-routed. Trip Stats and Data: Users are able to see trends in their travel habits (miles travelled, airports visited, time per state/country) and sync with other services for smart notifications and reminders. Battery charger: Users can recharge their electronic devices up to six times while on the go. A built-in battery charger can also be used to fully charge devices six times over. Entering your flight details in the app will provide you with numerous updates on your flight such as its current status. The app will also check the weather at your destination and tell you the sorts of things you'll need to pack. Lifting up the handle, meanwhile, will activate the scales that are built into the suitcase –- with the weight displayed on the app. A lock and unlock feature is also built into the suitcase; proximity sensors detect if you have walked away and automatically lock it when you’re not nearby. Another bugbear of travellers is the moment a bag gets re-routed, leaving the person stranded in a new destination with none of their belongings. The location software in the suitcase, though, shows you where the bag is at any given moment so it can be found when lost or re-routed. Users can also see their travel habits including miles travelled, airports visited and time spent in each country with the app. 'We came up with the idea for Bluesmart after suffering a couple of bad experiences with our luggage, when airlines forced us to check bags only to have them mishandled or lost,' said Tomi Pierucci, co-founder of Bluesmart. 'We realised that with all the amazing technology available today, we could do better. 'Suitcases haven’t seen much innovation in decades, so we decided to design a suitcase for this century.' Proximity sensors lock the suitcase when they detect you have walked away, or it can also be locked manually through the app (shown). GPS tells you where your bag is if it gets re-routed to another flight, and a built-in battery can charge your smartphone six times over . Lifting the handle activates interior scales that weigh the suitcase (shown). It will also give you tips on what clothes to take to your destination. The team are currently seeking £31,000 ($50,000) on Indiegogo for Bluesmart, and they expect to start shipping in August 2015 .","New York team has designed a smart suitcase with built-in technology .

"Former British Airways pilot Bartle Frere, who is accused of having sex with underage boys in India in between long-haul flights . A British Airways pilot accused of sex offences against underage boys has denied he is a paedophile, a court heard. Bartle Frere, 50, is said to have used his former job with British Airways to meet  boys in India and lavish them with money and gifts. The bachelor, of Abingdon, Oxfordshire, is also accused of a string of sex charges against two boys in the UK, who it is alleged he abused after paying them to do odd jobs around his house. Giving evidence for the first time in his trial at Bournemouth Crown Court, Frere described himself as 'asexual' - saying he had no interest in sex at all with either men or women. 'I've never really had any preferences one way or the other,' Frere told jurors. 'I've always had a low sex drive. It's never something I have required or desired in my life. 'I don't find myself being sexually attracted to anyone or anything.' David Fisher QC, defending Frere, asked the defendant whether he was interested sexually in young boys. Frere replied: 'No, no doubt at all. Sexual attraction would give arousal and I have never had any arousal through contact with boys.' Mr Fisher also asked Frere about his 'interest in young boys'. 'I find their company stimulating. I enjoy the banter you can have with them,' Frere told the jury. 'You can get laughs quite easily with youngsters and with adults you have to work much harder to get laughs. The energy they produce is stimulating. 'I also find young boys aesthetically pleasing to look at but I don't find them sexually attractive in any way. 'Some people find Ming vases pleasing to look at. I find young women pleasing to look at but in a different sense.' Frere added: 'I don't automatically avert my gaze if a youngster walks in the room - it's difficult to pin it down.' But Frere told the court he felt 'guilty' for not providing his parents with grandchildren and having to come home after work to an empty house. 'In some ways I regret not having a family,' he said. The court heard that Frere worked for British Airways for 25 years - rising to the rank of captain - until leaving in February this year. Frere was arrested in November last year after police raided his former home in Dorset, finding pornographic videos and indecent pictures on his computer, and children's clothing in a bedroom drawer . He had gained his private pilot's licence as a teenager and later qualified as a commercial pilot when he joined British Airways in 1989. Frere was arrested in November last year after police raided his former home in Dorset, finding pornographic videos and indecent pictures on his computer, and children's clothing in a bedroom drawer. Further computer investigations uncovered Frere's regular social network contact with teenage boys in India. Five counts of arranging or facilitating sex with children between 2007 and 2013 . Five counts of indecent assault on a boy under 16 between 2001 and 2003 . One count of indecency and two more serious offences with a boy under 16 in Dorset between 2001 and 2003 . Six counts of possessing indecent photographs of children . Four counts of making indecent photographs of children . Two other offences involving a different complainant between 2012 and 2013 . The defendant told the court that he found India a fascinating place and would regularly take monthly British Airways flights to Chennai, spending rest days visiting the nearby fishing village of Nochi Kuppam. He explained that he became friends with village families because of his 'passion' for photography - taking pictures of both children and adults. 'I took an interest in the children and they took an interest in me,' he said. Frere said that he bought them clothes and gifts, including iPhones and sports equipment - sometimes spending up to £200 on them during a trip. 'They were asking for money, which I didn't like giving,' he said. 'For the cost of me eating in the crew hotel I found I could feed about a dozen children in a local restaurant. 'If I was there for several days I might spend a couple of hundred pounds, maybe less. I am in a position of being very well paid and don't have to support a family - it's money I can afford.' The jury was also shown a film Frere had made during one of his trips to Nochi Kuppam of a boat trip he took with local boys and adults. The video, which had the Bollywood soundtrack 'Crazy Kiya Re' accompanying it, showed boys jumping from the boat into the sea and playing with a body board Frere had brought from the UK for them. Frere denies a total of 25 sex charges. The defendant told the court that he found India a fascinating place and would regularly take monthly British Airways flights to Chennai. Pictured, the city's Kapaleeswarer Siva Temple . Frere denies all 25 charges against him as his trial at Bournemouth Crown Court, pictured, continues . He is accused of five offences of arranging or facilitating the commission of a child sex offence, which relates to his alleged conduct with boys in India. Against the first alleged victim in the UK, he is charged with five counts of indecent assault; one count of indecency with a child and two charges of serious sexual assault. Frere faces accusations against a second UK victim. He is charged with one count of sexual activity with a child and one charge of attempting to record a person doing a private act. The defendant also faces six charges of possessing indecent photographs of a child and four charges of making indecent photographs of a child. The trial continues.

"Joan Rivers's personal doctor is 'devastated' and 'unable to sleep' over reports she was involved in the throat surgery that led to the death of the star, it was today claimed. Dr Gwen Korovin - who was not authorized to be in the operating room at the time - also plans to cooperate with investigators in a bid to clear her name, according to a close source. The 56-year-old ENT has remained silent following claims she took a selfie with the comedienne before the fatal procedure at Yorkville Endoscopy clinic in Manhattan on August 28. But today, a source close to her revealed she is determined to prove she has nothing to hide. Scroll down for video . Doctor: Dr Gwen Korovin (pictured leaving her office in New York City this week) is 'devastated' and 'unable to sleep' over reports she was involved in the throat surgery that led to the death of the star, it was today claimed . 'This has been devastating for Dr Korovin,' the source told Radar. 'Her patients are extended family, not just the celebrities. She has been unable to sleep and has been hounded by the media. 'She will absolutely cooperate with investigators from the New York Health Department and Medical Examiner's Office.' Rivers, who rose to fame as a guest on The Tonight Show, died aged 81 after she stopped breathing and went into cardiac arrest during the routine surgery. She was rushed to nearby Mout Sinai hospital, where she was put on life support, but never regained consciousness. She passed away on September 4. Earlier this week, Dr Korovin, known as 'throat specialist to the stars', released a statement saying she has 'no comment' to make about the tragic incident. However, sources close to the medic have accused CNN - who originally published the story of her alleged involvement - of 'making up lies'. Tragic: Rivers, a former guest on The Tonight Show, died aged 81 after she stopped breathing and went into cardiac arrest during the surgery. She was rushed to a nearby hospital, but never regained consciousness . Investigation: Rivers's surgery, which was with gastroenterologist Dr Lawrence Cohen (right), intended to help diagnose her hoarse voice and sore throat. Left, Dr Korovin has been reported to be the star's personal doctor . According to TMZ, Dr Korovin has also denied performing a biopsy on Joan. However it is unknown whether she performed any other procedure while reportedly in the room. In the statement, attorneys from Abrams and Fensterman acting on behalf of Dr Korovin said she is 'respected and admired' in the medical community, but will not be discussing the incident. It read: 'Gwen S. Korovin M.D. is a highly experienced, board certified otolaryngologist. She maintains priveleges at one of the city's most prestigious hospitals. She is respected and admired by her peers in the medical community and she is revered by her patients. 'As a matter of personal and professional policy, Dr Korovin does not publicly discus her patients or their care and treatment. Further, Dr Korovin is prohibited by state and federal confidentiality laws from discussing her care and treatment of any particular patient. 'For these reasons, neither Dr Korovin nor her attorneys will have any public comment on recent press reports regarding her practice. We ask that the press pleases respect Dr Korovin's personal and professional policy of not discussing her patients as well as the privacy of her patients.' Dr Korovin, who counts Hugh Jackman, Julie Andrews, Lady Gaga, and Ariana Grande  among her celebrity patients, is an esteemed ear, nose and throat specialist based in Manhattan. She has even been involved in a documentary with singer Celine Dion. Rivers's surgery, which was with gastroenterologist Dr Lawrence Cohen, intended to help diagnose her hoarse voice and sore throat, and involved the insertion of a camera down her throat. Dr Korovin is pictured with comedienne Joy Behar at the Celebrity Dinner Talkfest held at the New York Friars Club in June 2011 . During the operation, an ear, nose and throat specialist - who was not certified by the clinic, as required by law - performed a biopsy on the star's vocal cords. The medic was described by the source as Joan's personal ENT specialist, who is reported to be Dr Korovin. According to CNN, Dr Korovin also allegedly snapped a selfie with Rivers while the star was under anesthesia.","Dr Gwen Korovin allegedly in room when Joan Rivers stopped breathing .

"A woman is demanding compensation from a private plastic surgery clinic after a breast enlargement operation left her chest horribly disfigured. Katarina Chladova was looking to make her breasts just slightly larger when she visited the clinic two years ago, and paid £3,300 for the implant procedure. But when the bandages were removed her breasts were left in such a terrible state that she returned to the clinic repeatedly for corrective follow-up operations, but each time the result was worse. Katarina Chladova, pictured left before operation, spent £3,300 on the procedure which left her breasts, right, horribly disfigured . Miss Chladova, from Dubnica in Slovakia, said: 'I wanted them to be a little bit larger and after reading the . literature from the surgeon in Nitra decided to spend £3,300 on the . operation two years ago. 'But afterwards when all the bandages were taken off I was shocked by . the results and was asked to pay to go back for corrective surgery, but . every time he operated they looked worse.' The young woman said that she was now so embarrassed by the way she looked that she couldn't wear anything other than frumpy clothing to cover up her figure - and was too embarrassed to even go on the beach in a swimming costume. When asked for comment by local media, the surgeon - who has not been named because of privacy laws - said he didn't see why he needed to pay compensation, but admitted: 'Her breasts do not look the best, I wouldn't be exactly thrilled if they were my wife's.' Katarina was left with uneven, misshapen breasts and nipples as well as huge scars, and is now too embarrassed to wear tight clothes or a swimming costume . Katarina is now hoping the courts will settle the matter, saying: 'I will fight for as long as it takes to expose this man as incompetent.' In the UK, the average cost of breast implant surgery is between £4,000 and £5,000, but patients must take into account that most implants need to be replaced every 10 to 15 years at further cost. An increasing number of women are opting for 'medical tourism', travelling abroad to undergo cosmetic procedures which are usually considerably cheaper. Anthony Armstrong, a consultant plastic surgeon and chair of BAPRAS’s clinical effectiveness committee, explains on the NHS website: . Taking your surgical needs abroad is not without risks . 'If you're considering cosmetic surgery abroad, do your research first. Cosmetic surgery abroad often costs less than in the UK, but make sure you weigh any potential savings against potential risks. Both BAAPS (The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons) and BAPRAS (The British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons) have voiced concerns about patients having problems after cosmetic surgery procedures abroad. No surgery is risk free, and complications can arise after surgery in the UK or abroad. If complications arise after an operation carried out in the UK, it's the surgeon’s responsibility to provide follow-up treatment. It's part of their duty of care to their patient. When patients seek cosmetic treatment abroad, aftercare is not always straightforward. Some of the overseas clinics don’t have someone in the UK that you can turn to if problems arise.' How to be most prepared: . Beware of surgery and holiday packages which can often minimise the contact you have with the surgeon who will be carrying out your procedure . Establish what would happen if you were to have any problems with the treatment. What insurance arrangements does the clinic or doctor have, and will these cover you? What will your own travel insurance cover? Ordinary travel or holiday insurance will not cover you if something goes wrong during or after planned treatment abroad.

"Alvin Stardust, pictured with the guitar, which is father bought for just £1 and two shillings . A guitar used by pop star Alvin Stardust to collect the autographs of some of music’s biggest names is now worth more than £1 million. Stardust, 71, was 12 when he was given the instrument in 1955 by his father, who had bought it for £1 and two shillings. The youngster took it to a Buddy Holly and the Crickets concert in Doncaster where the band signed it – and the starstruck teen dubbed the guitar ‘Peggy Sue’ after Holly’s song. Those first autographs started a tradition and the guitar has since been signed by, among others, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and Sir Cliff Richard and has been valued at £1.25 million. Stardust, who enjoyed a No 1 hit in 1974 with Jealous Mind, has no plans to sell but when a friend said he could get a decent price for it, he had it valued. He said: ‘When my dad gave me that guitar, little did we know, after all these years, what a story it would be able to tell.’ The singer collected many of the signatures when he was a teenager performing as Shane Fenton and the Fentones in the early 1960s. He said: ‘I hung around stage doors schmoozing until they let me in. Since I always took Peggy Sue, they often assumed I was part of the act and just ushered me through.’ Explaining how he got the autographs of The Beatles at the Albert Hall in 1963, he said: ‘I knew a security chap called Len. He whisked my guitar away and a few minutes later came back with all the boys’ autographs on it. ‘They didn’t know it was mine, but later that night John and Paul, who I knew a bit, came up to me and said, “You’re from London – where can we meet some birds?” ’ Rick Zsigmond, owner of Vintage Guitar Emporium in West London, which valued the instrument, said: ‘The fact it tells the story of rock from its very infancy and in such a wonderful way is what makes it so valuable.’ Signatures from Sir Cliff Richard, The Beatles, Buddy Holly and The Rolling Stones can be seen on the reverse .","Stardust was 12 when he was given guitar by father who bought it for £1 .

"The search for the missing Malaysian Airline's black box involves a staggering array of sophisticated ships, aircraft and equipment, with eight countries contributing 17 vessels and 19 aircraft – including British nuclear submarine HMS Tireless. And today, it looked like the scale of the operation had paid off, with reports that the flight recorder had been located deep in the Indian Ocean. Perth radio station 6PR tweeted the discovery, citing aviation expert Geoffrey Thomas, who revealed the flight recorder had finally been found more than a month after the Boeing 777 went missing. The black box is likely to be around 15,000 feet down and a staggering array of ships and planes are hunting it . Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who is in . China, said searchers are 'very confident' the signals detected were from the . black box from MH370, which mysteriously vanished as it flew from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing with 239 . people on board on March 8. 'We . have very much narrowed down the search area [to the southern Indian Ocean]...and we are very confident . the signals are from the black box from MH370,' said Mr Abbott. 'We have a series of detections, some lasting for quite a long period of time. 'We're now getting to the stage from . where the black box is starting to fade. We're hoping to get as much . information as we can before the signal finally expires. 'I . really don't want to give any more information than that at this . stage...as a sign of respect to the Chinese people and their families.'. Speaking from Shanghai, China, Mr Abbott added that today's discovery was a huge step in solving the mystery - and even claimed that officials believe they can now pinpoint the position of the missing black box flight recorder to ‘within some kilometres’. 'This is probably the most difficult search in human history,' he said. 'Among tragedy, however, there is hope. We are confident we know the position of the black box to the nearest kilometre. Vigilant: Captain Flt Lt Tim McAlevey of the Royal New Zealand Air Force flying a P-3 Orion during the MH370 search . Hi-tech: Crew members of a Royal New Zealand Air Force P-3 Orion operate radar and sensor systems during the search .

A Royal Australian Air Force AP-3C Orion conducts a low level fly-by before dropping supplies to Australian Navy ship HMAS Toowoomba as they continue to search for MH370 on Friday . 'But . confidence in the position is not the same as recovering the wreckage . from more than 4.5km beneath the sea and finally determining all that . happened on that flight.' The . fact that Mr Abbott has reportedly used the word 'confident' suggests . that searchers are finally convinced that weeks of scouring the Indian . Ocean might now have resulted in the discovery of the missing Boeing . 777. The Prime Minister, who also met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing today, said he will first need to brief the Chinese because most of the 239 passengers were from that country. Relatives have complained in the past of not being kept informed of progress in the search. 'This will be a very long, slow and painstaking process,' Mr Abbott told President Xi. Mr Abbott's announcement came after a fifth ping . was detected around 1,500 miles north west of Perth, in western Australia. The signal was captured on Thursday by a Royal . Australian Air Force Orion P-3 aircraft, which had been dropping sonar buoys into the water at the time. The Australian Defense vessel Ocean Shield tows a pinger locator in the first search for the missing flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder . The towed pinger locator on the deck of the Australian Defense Vessel Ocean Shield . The search area in the Indian Ocean, West of Australia, where pinger contacts have been recorded in the search for flight MH370 . The buoys each have a hydrophone . listening device that dangles about 300 metres (1,000 feet) below the . surface and their data are sent via radio back to a plane, Royal . Australian Navy Commodore Peter Leavy said. However, Angus Houston, who is . coordinating the search for the plane,later said in a statement that an . initial assessment had determined the signal was not related to an . aircraft black box. Even if . it is discovered, the plane's black box, or flight . data and cockpit voice recorders, may hold the answers to why the Boeing . 777 lost communications and veered so far off course when it vanished . while flying to Beijing. Search crews are racing against time because the . batteries powering the devices' locator beacons last only about a month - . and more than a month has passed since the plane disappeared. Finding . the black boxes after the batteries fail will be extremely difficult . because the water in the area is 4,500 meters (15,000 feet) deep. The . Australian ship Ocean Shield is towing a U.S. Navy device that detects . black box signals, and two sounds it heard last Saturday were determined to . be consistent with the signals emitted from aircraft flight recorders. Two more sounds were detected in the same general area on Tuesday - just days before the fifth ping was detected yesterday. The planned search area in the Indian Ocean, west of Australia, for the wreckage of flight MH370 on Friday April 11 . Friday's search area in relation to previously searched sectors .

It's thought that the black box lies 15,000 feet down in the Indian Ocean . The Ocean Shield was still towing its pinger . locator to try to find additional signals today, and the Orions were . continuing their hunt, Mr Houston said. The underwater search zone is . currently a 1,300-square-kilometre(500-square-mile) patch of the ocean . floor, about the size of the city of Los Angeles. 'It is vital to . glean as much information as possible while the batteries on the . underwater locator beacons may still be active,' Mr Houston said in a . statement. The searchers are trying to pinpoint the exact location . of the source of the signals so they can send down a robotic submersible . to look for wreckage. Mr Houston said today that a decision to send the . sub could be 'some days away' The Bluefin 21 submersible takes six . times longer to cover the same area as the pinger locator being towed by . the Ocean Shield and would take six weeks to two months to canvass the . current underwater search zone. Complicating matters is the depth of . the seabed in the search area. The signals are emanating from 4,500 . metres(15,000 feet) below the surface, which is the deepest the Bluefin . can dive. The search coordination center said it was considering . options in case a deeper-diving sub is needed. Meanwhile, the centre . said the surface area to be searched for floating debris had been . narrowed to 46,713 square kilometres(18,036 square miles) of ocean . extending from 2,300 kilometres (1,400 miles) northwest of Perth. Investigators believe the plane went down in the southern . Indian Ocean based on a flight path calculated from its contacts with a . satellite and analysis of its speed and fuel capacity. Separately, a . Malaysian government official said yesterday that investigators have . concluded the pilot spoke the last words to air traffic control, 'Good . night, Malaysian three-seven-zero,' and that his voice had no signs of . duress. A re-examination of the last communication from the cockpit was . initiated after authorities last week reversed their initial statement . that the co-pilot was speaking different words. The senior government official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak to the media. Meanwhile, . Malaysia's government has now begun to investigate civil aviation and . military authorities to determine why opportunities to identify and . track Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 were missed in the chaotic hours . after it vanished, two officials said. The . preliminary internal enquiries come as tensions mount between civilian . and military authorities over who bears most responsibility for the . initial confusion and any mistakes that led to a week-long search in the . wrong ocean. 'What happened at that time is being . investigated and I can't say any more than that because it involves the . military and the government,' a senior government official told Reuters. In . an interview with Reuters last weekend, Malaysia Airlines Chief . Executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said internal enquiries were under way, . although he declined to give details. A government spokesman did not respond to Reuters questions over whether an investigation had been launched. The senior government source said it was aimed at getting a detailed picture of the initial response. It was unclear which government department was in charge or whether a formal probe had been opened. Malaysia's opposition coalition has demanded a parliamentary inquiry into what happened on the ground in those first few hours. Government officials have said any formal inquiry should not begin until the flight's black box recorders are found.","Reports have emerged that missing Malaysian Airline's black box has been located deep in the Indian Ocean .

The research questioned 545 fishermen's wives in Kenya, of which just 34 admitted they had affairs. Is size still king? A study of fishermen found those with larger penises were more likely to be cheated on . The male fishermen who had been cheated on were better-endowed than those whose wives did not have affairs, the researchers said. The better-endowed husbands had fully erect penises of around six inches, while whose whose wives were faithful had erect penises of around five inches. The report's authors wrote: 'Surprisingly, spouse longer fully erect penis was associated with increased likelihood of the women having extra-marital partnerships. 'From these results, every one inch longer penis increased the likelihood of women being involved in extra-marital partnership by almost one-and-half times. 'Similarly, our qualitative data also support this finding. Women associated large penises with pain and discomfort during sex which precludes the enjoyment and sexual satisfaction that women are supposed to feel.' Researchers followed up the figures by conducting interviews with the women. Happy couple: There was an upside, however, as just 34 women out of the 545 said they had cheated . One said: 'It hurts so much that I will have to look for another man.' The joint study was published in the journal PLOS ONE by scientists from the Center for Microbiology Research in Kisumu, Kenya; Kenyatta University in the capital Nairobi; the University of California and University of Alabama. The aim was to discover more about the way partners have affairs to reduce the spread of HIV. The study also found younger women were more likely to cheat on their partners. Participants were asked to take the measurements themselves using a 15-inch ruler. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the researchers had to take an average between the lengths the fishermen claimed they had obtained and those submitted by their wives. There were 'discrepancies' between the two, the authors wrote.","Study examined 545 women in Kenya, of whom just 34 cheated on husbands .

"An animal abuser has been shopped to the police by his own family after they captured video of him abusing the family cat. James Fiengo, 43, of Port St. Lucie, Florida was arrested on Tuesday for abusing the family cat Joey and is also accused of Daisy, a female German shepherd dog. Port St. Lucie Animal Control learned of the abuse from Fiengo's wife, who showed animal control the video taken by their 12-year-old daughter. Scroll down for video . Animal abuser James Fiengo has been arrested after his family gave authorities video evidence of him repeatedly abusing the family's cat Joey including smacking him like he was a rag doll . The abuser: Fiengo has been arrested on two counts of felony animal cruelty . The stomach-churning video footage shows Fiengo treating the cat like a rag doll, while he makes faces to the camera as if he is enjoying what he is doing. In the footage Fiengo squeezes Joey’s head while the cat can be heard crying out in pain. He also holds the clearly distressed animal upside down and bats its head as if it was a ball. Not shown on the video are other claims of abuse made by Fiengo's wife. She claims Fiengo regularly picked Joey up by the tail and swung him back and forth, squeezed the cat's tail in an attempt to 'crack it like a stick,' threw the cat across the house and punched him in the stomach. A vet has examined Joey and found cartilage damage to his right ear, while an x-ray of his tail found it showed chronic trauma . Fiengo's wife says the cat 'doesn't chew right' and has a deformed ear now, reports CBS News. She also told police Fiengo abuses the dog Daisy by sitting on her and biting her muzzle until she yelped. She said the family has had two cats prior to Joey that she had to get rid of 'for their own protection' because Fiengo 'cracked' the tail on the first one and threw the second one against a wall, knocking it unconscious. Video footage shows Fiengo, right, squeezing Joey's head while the cat can be heard crying out in pain . Fiengo's wife said she has obtained a restraining order against her husband for threats he has made to his daughter for recording the videos. A veterinarian examined the cat and found cartilage damage to the cat's right ear. The vet also x-rayed the cat's tail and found it showed chronic trauma. He has been arrested on two counts of felony animal cruelty.","James Fiengo's daughter recorded video footage of him abusing the family's cat Joey .

"U.S. goalie Tim Howard was randomly drug-tested immediately after Tuesday's match against Belgium during which he set a World Cup record by making an amazing 16 saves. Howard wasn't able to join his teammates in the locker room immediately after the 2-1 defeat because FIFA selected him to take the test. ‘I got dragged into drug testing, again, randomly,’ Howard told ESPN Radio when asked about the somber mood after the match. ‘So I didn't hear all of [the reactions].’ Scroll down for video .

"A decomposed body found in a West London park on Saturday is that of Arnis Zalkalns - the prime suspect in the Alice Gross murder investigation, Scotland Yard said today. A post-mortem examination of the body found in Boston Manor Park has been held and it has been formally identified as 41-year-old Zalkalns of Ealing, west London. The grim discovery in a part of the park used for shelter by Eastern Europeans for years ended the Europe-wide manhunt for the convicted murderer, who is the only suspect in the death of 14-year-old Alice. Scotland Yard said the cause of death is consistent with hanging and there is no evidence of any third party involvement. Scroll down for video .

Isolated: This blue screen guarding the spot where Zalkalns' body was found in a deeply wooded area . The badly decomposed body of Arnis Zalkalns, 41, was found hanged in a dense copse of trees that he is believed to have once called home. Above, his corpse is removed in a body bag on Sunday . The grim discovery ended the Europe-wide manhunt for the convicted murderer, who is the only suspect in the death of 14-year-old Alice (left) A Scotland Yard spokesman said today that the search for the missing teenager has been one of the most 'complex in recent times'. Adding that it was carried out over 25 square kilometres of canals rivers and land. He said: 'These searches expanded south and west from Trumpers Way for a further eight square kilometres, including Boston Manor Park and Osterley Park. 'These initial visual searches of open land highlighted inaccessible areas that required further search with specialist equipment, trained officers, police divers or search dogs. 'A number of the areas identified for further search were within Boston Manor Park. 'The densely overgrown area where Arnis Zalkalns was discovered was one of these areas. This area had not been searched by police previously. He added: 'The recovery required a substantial removal of forestry to enable access for forensic teams. The body was eventually removed shortly after 10am on Sunday.' On Saturday the suspect's body was cut down as dozens of specialist officers scoured the park for clues . Police said the corpse was 'badly decomposed', raising the prospect that it has been there since he went missing a week after Alice vanished. Above, an ambulance arrives to remove the body . Meanwhile detectives are keen to speak to a mystery teenager who was spotted with Zalkalns just hours after the schoolgirl went missing on August 28. The boy, believed to be about 14 or 15, was said to have been with the prime suspect in an off licence in Ealing, west London, the day she disappeared. Shopkeeper Fereydoon Alavi, who is in his 50s, said the unknown teenager went into the Corner Shop and tried to buy alcohol before being accompanied by Zalkalns. He said: 'He was here with a teenage boy - I think it was August 28, in the afternoon/evening time. 'The boy tried to buy cider but he didn't have ID so I didn't serve him.  He then went outside and asked the man to come in for him. 'He seemed out of it, he was very jumpy, like he was on drugs.  He was unshaven, scruffy, and smelt - it was just suspicious. Detectives want to speak to a mystery teenage boy who was spotted with Zalkalns at the Corner Shop in Ealing, west London (pictured), just hours after 14-year-old schoolgirl Alice went missing on August 28 . 'The boy came in first. He asked to buy cider but I refused him when he had no ID. 'Then the other man came in, he bought the cider. He seemed out of it. He was unshaven, scruffy and smelly. The whole thing was suspicious.' Mr Alavi, who also said the man appeared suspiciously 'hyper', said the boy had the 'beginnings of a beard', was of Asian appearance and 'looked like he had been sleeping outside'. The shopkeeper said he was visited by police in mid-September, and confirmed to them that he had seen Zalkalns, before giving them his CCTV of the man's visit to his shop in The Avenue, Ealing. The corpse was found in parkland which is a popular haunt for Eastern European immigrant rough sleepers. Above, forensics officers arrive at a tent erected at the scene in Boston Manor Park where the body was found . It comes as police continue to face a barrage of searching questions over their handling of the ill-fated inquiry in which the victim's body was only found after weeks of searching. As residents expressed disbelief that the huge police operation failed to find the missing Latvian more quickly: . On Saturday the suspect's body was cut down as dozens of specialist officers scoured the park for clues. The investigation is far from over despite the death of the only suspect. Detectives face months of painstaking forensic work to piece together Arnis Zalkalns' final days. The investigation will run parallel to the one examining the body of Alice Gross and the materials used to hide her corpse. Police will compile their evidence and pass it to the Crown Prosecution Service. Senior lawyers will consider the case, and are then likely to announce whether it would have been strong enough to mount a prosecution. In the short term, tests will ascertain how Alice died. But it could be many months before a full public inquest can draw a line under the crime. Police said the corpse was 'badly decomposed', raising the prospect that it has been there since he went missing a week after Alice vanished. There was a 'substantial' amount of forestry which had to be removed to allow forensic teams to get to the scene, a spokesman for Scotland Yard said. It was found in parkland which is a popular haunt for Eastern European immigrant rough sleepers. Zalkalns' family said he used his military training to live rough for weeks when he moved to London in 2007. Those who knew the Latvian think he may have stayed in the park, and it remained one of his favourite places. His former landlord Radoslav Andric, 64, said: 'He was a loner, he used to ride his bike around the park a lot. This park was like his escape from society. I believe that the last time I saw him he was on his way to the park.' The park runs alongside the Grand Union Canal, a mile from where Alice was last captured on CCTV. Locals described an isolated part where immigrants erect shelters as a 'no go' area. Linda Massey, from Friends of Boston Manor Park, said police searched the area a week ago. She added: 'We have rough sleepers in the park but the police did check all the tents. They're mainly Eastern Europeans.' Police cordoned off the area on Saturday following the discovery of the body of a man in Boston Manor Park . On September 28 uniformed officers were seen searching the same area. It is not known how long the body has been in the woods though it was said to be 'badly decomposed' Residents said the isolated 'no go' area of west London's Boston Manor Park has been used for shelter by Eastern Europeans for many years. Above, police search the site in Boston Manor Park . Local cafe owner Alex Khan said: 'He wasn't right, he was a very big weirdo. He would sometimes come in, order a coffee and say he liked to see the pretty little girls. 'It would always be between the hours that schools kicked out then he'd walk up to the park where they would all hang out.' It is thought that no suicide note was found, but detectives have CCTV of Zalkalns withdrawing money the day before he vanished. He sent some of it to his former mother-in-law in Latvia. On the weekend, Zalkalns' girlfriend, Katerina Laiblova, 39, complained that police took nine days to investigate after she reported him missing. And last night, Zalkalns' sister said police had not yet contacted her family to say they had found his body. MP Mr Pound, who has been supporting Alice's family at their Hanwell home, said: 'Police now have some serious questions to answer. However my first thoughts are with Alice Gross's family.' Those who knew the Latvian think he may have stayed in the park, and it remained one of his favourite places .

"The renowned US economist who predicted the US housing market crash and the subsequent global financial crisis has set his sights on the Australian economy, and the outlook is a little bleak. Nouriel 'Dr Doom' Roubini has predicted factors such as the tight federal budget and the slowing of growth in China could see the value of the Australia dollar drop by up to 20 percent. A new study released by Roubini Global Economics, founded by Dr Roubini, also revealed that Australia's growth could drop below 2 percent next year, Business Day reported. Dr Roubini also described the housing market boom as 'increasingly out of line' with economic fundamentals such as the unemployment rate and demand for goods and services. Huge hit: 'Dr Doom' says the Aussie dollar is likely in for a significant drop-off . Economic forecaster correctly predicted the U.S. housing crisis and GFC . The prestigious global forecaster earned his 'Dr Doom' title through consistently making grim predictions for the economic market. The report suggests the government's decision to tighten the federal budget as poorly timed, and said this may impact on the country's GDP. Despite the government and other forecasters maintaining the Australian economy is in good shape, this is the bleakest economic report ever to be published on the nation. In light of China's credit and property market problems, other economists have warned that despite their positive outlook on the economy at home, this could still pose a threat. 'Although some easing of China's credit crunch will help Australian exports in the short run, we see lower Chinese growth in 2015 as a headwind that will weaken Australia's growth and inflation next year, and weigh on growth-orientated assets such as equities and the Australian dollar,' Roubini's local analyst David Nowakowski wrote in the report. Predictions were also made that interest rates could be slashed by up to 2 percent, which would drive down the Australian dollar. The Australian dollar is likely to weaken to below US75¢ - a fall of around 20 per cent - on a combination of the lower interest rate differential and slumping GDP growth, with commodity price effects outweighing volumes,' Mr Nowakowski said.

"James Bond tried one. So, too, did writers Jack (On The Road) Kerouac and J.D. (Catcher In The Rye) Salinger. The artist who created Shrek swore by his, and spent half an hour inside it at least once a day. They were all devotees of the original love machine, invented in the Fifties by psycho-analyst and therapist Dr Wilhelm Reich as a pathway to a better, if not the best ever, sexual experience. Box of delights: Reich's Orgone . In some ways, you can't help feeling sorry for Austrian-born Reich — a disciple of Sigmund Freud in Vienna — who escaped from Hitler to the U.S. just before World War II. There he was, a prophet for the health- giving power of the guilt-free sexual climax. He coined the phrase 'sexual revolution' and devoted his life as a psycho-analyst to freeing us all from our repressive Victorian selves. Then, on the verge of the Swinging Sixties, with society about to hitch up its skirts and go sex mad, he died, and missed out on the supposed pleasure of his own Utopia. But his invention — later spoofed in a Woody Allen film as an 'Orgasmatron' — lived on, with its promise of delivering what he called 'orgastic potency', despite being little more than a plain wooden cupboard lined with metal. No wheels, no whistles, no ticklers or teasers, no bells. It was just a box. Yet, according to author Christopher Turner in a new biography of Reich, Sean Connery had one at the height of his James Bond fame. But whether sitting in the box delivered what its designer promised is another matter. If Connery was shaken or stirred, he never said. William Steig, author of the original Shrek comic book, revealed his gave him 'an inner vibration, a little bit like an orgasmic feeling' — which is a long way from blowing your socks off. American author Norman Mailer, who desperately searched for what he called the 'apocalyptic' sexual experience, admitted just before he died that he never achieved it with his version. They tried it: Actor Sean Connery, left, and, right, author Norman Mailer . Perhaps they were all just bonkers, you may think. But there was method — of a sort — in Reich's madness. More importantly, his theories had a lasting impact on our society, and not for the better. There is a direct link from his sanctification of free love and instant sex to the excesses of today's permissive society. At the beginning, however, Reich was a star turn in developing the discipline of psycho-analysis in the early years of the 20th century. As a shrink, he believed people needed to be freed from their inhibitions. But then he went out on a limb of his own with a radical theory. The release that came with sexual climax, he declared, was the key to a healthy mind and healthy body — and, indeed, as the scope of his vision expanded, to a healthy world. It would not only cure neurotics of their fears, but war-mongering fascists of their odious beliefs. 'Make love not war' was his belief long before it became a Sixties slogan. But his ambition didn't stop there. Reich was convinced he had discovered the very essence of life, a universal and eternal force that he named 'orgone' — hence the official name of his wooden box: the 'Orgone Energy Accumulator'. Spoof: Woody Allen is hauled from the Orgasmatron in his film The Sleeper . Orgone was not unlike the concept of the 'libido' his old teacher Freud had identified — except Reich insisted his life force had a physical presence, which manifested itself in glowing microscopic particles of matter he called 'bions'. It was the physical harvesting and harnessing of 'orgone' from the atmosphere that was the purpose of his sex machine — which was best used, he said, in direct sunlight, in open country and well away from electricity power lines. The wood in its construction absorbed the free-flying 'orgone' from the skies, while layers of metal kept it insulated inside. By concentrating the life force in this 'accumulator', he claimed, its users were charged up, much like a car battery plugged into the mains, and then experienced the sexual ecstasy that would free their minds and bodies. That the box heated up, he claimed, was proof of its ability to attract natural energy. Sceptics, however, suggested that confining someone inside an insulated container on a hot day was bound to lead to raised temperatures, but not necessarily anything else. Reich was undaunted. The potential of his contraption was, he maintained, limitless. It could heal the sick and even eliminate cancer tumours. It was the panacea the world had been waiting for. 'I am the discoverer of life energy,' he maintained confidently. So convinced was he that he challenged Albert Einstein, the world's greatest theoretical physicist, to experiment with an accumulator and endorse his discovery. The great man examined the evidence and dismissed Reich's theory as scientific nonsense. 'Orgone', he declared, simply did not exist. Thereafter he refused to take Reich's calls or discuss the matter. Slighted, rejected as a quack by the international psycho-analysis community and as a charlatan by the scientific one, Reich became increasingly paranoid. Everyone became a suspected enemy, even his ex-wife and daughter. Having become a virtual recluse at his home in Maine, he got on with building his accumulators — 250 in all — for a small number of thrill-seekers. Most were members of the emerging Beat generation of writers and artists, attracted by his unconventionality and his endorsement of free love. But then he fell foul of the law. The cures he claimed for his accumulator were judged by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to be false and misleading, and a court injunction ordered him to stop selling and distributing them. When he ignored the ban, he was jailed for two years in 1956 and his remaining machines destroyed. Piles of his books were burned by the authorities, an echo of what the Nazis had done to his work. His supporters suspected a conspiracy to silence him because of the subversive nature of his ideas. He died in prison, from a heart attack, in November 1957. His legacy, the love machine, ended up in a Museum of Questionable Medical Devices, alongside a foot-operated breast enlarger and a vacuum-powered hair restorer. But it took on a new life in popular culture. It inspired Jane Fonda's ecstasy as she was tucked up inside a so-called 'Excessive Machine' in the 1964 cult sci-fi parody Barbarella, and put the smile on Woody Allen's face after he stepped out of an 'Orgasmatron' in Sleeper (1973). It was Simon and Garfunkel's 'big, bright green pleasure machine'. Barbarella: Jane Fonda plays the eponymous heroine, trapped in the so-called Excessive Machine . But Reich's cultural impact went far deeper than jokey slots in films and songs. In many ways, it was his endorsement of sexual release that put the swinging into the Sixties. Sex was good, restraint was bad. Our permissive, sex-saturated century has its origins in Reich's so-called science. It was not meant to work out like this, of course. According to his theories, once the shackles were off, the world would be a better place. It hasn't proved true. In an article analysing Reich, Time magazine concluded that America was one giant 'orgone' box. 'From innumerable screens and stages, posters and pages, it flashes larger-than-life-sized images of sex. The message is sex will save you.' Astonishingly, that description was of 1964, an era that now looks positively quaint. In the 47 years since then, all semblance of restraint seems to have been abandoned. Two conflicting interpretations flowed from Reich's love contraption. 'To the bohemians,' says his biographer, Christopher Turner, 'it was a liberation machine, the wardrobe that would lead to Utopia. But to conservatives it was Pandora's box, out of which escaped anarchism and promiscuous sex.' There, if you'll forgive the expression, is the rub. And how has it turned out? In a Radio 3 documentary on Reich earlier this year, Germaine Greer was asked about the influence of his theories on The Female Eunuch, her ground-breaking 1970 book about women's liberation. 'We did think freeing sexuality would allow virtue to flower,' she said. 'We were wrong, I think.' Her words could serve as Reich's requiem, carved on one of his orgasmatrons and, along with the legacy of the Sixties he inspired, laid to rest.",The 'Orgasmatron' - used by Sean Connery and Norman Mailer - promised sexual highs .
"More than three million deaths worldwide in 2012 were due to harmful use of alcohol - and Europe is the region with the highest consumption of alcohol per person. Alcohol consumption can not only lead to dependence, but also increases the risk of developing more than 200 diseases including liver cirrhosis and some cancers, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said. A report launched by the United Nations health agency found harmful use of alcohol - drinking that causes detrimental health and social consequences for the drinker, the people around the drinker and society at large - led to 3.3million deaths around the world in 2012. A map showing the amount of alcohol consumed by each country, with Belarus, Moldova and Lithuania topping the table . The Global status report on alcohol and health in 2014 also found that harmful use of alcohol makes people more susceptible to infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and pneumonia. The report provides country profiles for alcohol consumption in the 194 WHO member states, the impact on public health and policy responses. Globally, Europe is the region with the highest consumption of alcohol per capita, with some of its countries having particularly high consumption rates, according to the WHO. Trend analysis shows that the consumption level is stable over the last five years in the region, as well as in Africa and the Americas, though increases have been reported in the South East Asia and the Western Pacific regions. Dr Oleg Chestnov, WHO assistant director-general for non-communicable diseases and mental health, said there is ‘no room for complacency’. ‘More needs to be done to protect populations from the negative health consequences of alcohol consumption. ‘The report clearly shows that there is no room for complacency when it comes to reducing the harmful use of alcohol,’ he said. In 2012 more than three million deaths worldwide were caused by alcohol . The average amount of pure alcohol consumed per capita in each country between 2008 and 20101. Belarus – 17.5 litres . 2. Republic of Moldova – 16.8 litres . 3. Lithuania – 15.4 litres . 4. Russian Federation – 15.1 litres . 5. Romania – 14.4 litres . 6. Ukraine – 13.9 litres . 7. Andorra – 13.8 litres . 8. Hungary – 13.3 litres . 9. Czech Republic and Slovakia – 13 litres . 10. Portugal – 12.9 litres . On average, every person in the world aged 15 or older drinks 6.2 litres of pure alcohol per year. But as less than half the population - 38.3 per cent - actually drinks alcohol, this means that those who do drink consume on average 17 litres of pure alcohol annually, the WHO said. The report also points out that a higher percentage of deaths among men than among women are from alcohol-related causes - 7.6 per cent of men's deaths and four per cent of women's deaths - though there is evidence that women may be more vulnerable to some alcohol-related health conditions compared to men. The report's authors said there is concern over the steady increase in alcohol use among women. Dr Shekhar Saxena, director for mental health and substance abuse at WHO, said: ‘We found that worldwide about 16 per cent of drinkers engage in heavy episodic drinking - often referred to as “binge-drinking” - which is the most harmful to health. ‘Lower income groups are more affected by the social and health consequences of alcohol. They often lack quality health care and are less protected by functional family or community networks.’","Drinking alcohol increases the risk of developing more than 200 diseases .

The two men can be seen walking along the pavement moments before they split up . Just inches before reaching the car, two shots can be heard as one of the men falls to the ground. Officers . then surround the prone body before four more shots ring out felling . the second man, as another two shots are fired - eight in total. Screams can be heard as the men are filmed lying on the ground as the officers swarm around the pair and detain them. The . footage appears to have been taken from a nearby block of flats . overlooking the scene after Drummer Lee Rigby, 25, was killed by two . assailants. A total of four people including the men shot by police have now been arrested in connection with the brutal attack. The footage shows one of the men making a move towards a police car as it pulls up in the road . Screams can be heard from the crowd who have gathered at the scene following the shots . Firearms tactics expert former Detective Chief Inspector Peter Kirkham told the Daily Mirror: 'I have never seen anything like this before, or even heard of it happening before. 'For two suspects to carry out a brutal attack like this then stand around in plain sight waiting for the police is crazy.' He added the officers 'had no option' but to stop them by opening fire. Scotland . Yard said a man and a woman, both 29, were held today on suspicion of . conspiracy to murder and are being questioned at a police station in . south London. The two . men who were shot, aged 22 and 28, have been arrested on suspicion of . murder and remain in hospital in a stable condition with non . life-threatening injuries. Brutal killing: Drummer Lee Rigby, 25, from the 2nd Battalion, Royal Regiment of Fusiliers who was murdered in Woolwich . Six . residential addresses were being searched today as part of the . investigation, three in south London, one in east London, one in north . London and one in Lincolnshire. In a statement the force said: 'This is a large, complex and fast-moving investigation which continues to develop. 'Many lines of inquiry are being followed by detectives and the investigation is progressing well.' Officers have recovered a number of items from the murder scene and continue to appeal for witnesses to get in touch, and send in footage and photographs of what happened. Drummer Rigby was brutally murdered by two attackers who were British and of Nigerian descent. The pair, who were shot by police, were known to security services, and apparently shouted 'Allah Akhbar' as they struck. Angels of Woolwich: Gemini Donnelly-Martin, 20, and her mother Amanda (right) talk to Adebolajo while Ingrid Loyau-Kennett (left) talks to the Adebowale as Lee Rigby lies dead in the road . It is believed that the serving soldier was run over and then hacked to death, yards from a primary school. Eyewitnesses said that one of the attackers charged towards officers clutching bloodied weapons including a meat cleaver, while the other brandished a gun. Police watchdog the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said it is not pursuing any criminal or misconduct offences in relation to the officers who used their weapons. Grief: A wellwisher outside the army barracks, 200 yards from where Drummer Lee Rigby was killed, by the huge - and growing - pile of flowers . 'Dear soldier': A handwritten note left in honour of Lee Rigby close to the scene of the brutal murder in Woolwich . Anguish: A police officer places another bouquet of flowers outside the Woolwich barracks yesterday . IPCC investigators have viewed CCTV of what happened, and said two officers fired guns and one discharged a Taser. They have given initial accounts of what happened. IPCC commissioner Derrick Campbell said: 'Our investigation is as a result of the tragic events yesterday and I would like to express my sincere sympathies to the family of Lee Rigby at this terrible time. Rant: A man identified as Michael Adebolajo, 28, brandishes a meat cleaver with bloodied hands near the scene of the killing . 'We have viewed CCTV footage of the police shooting. At this stage we are not pursuing any criminal or misconduct offences. 'Officers have provided initial statements and we will be obtaining additional accounts. 'The IPCC is independently verifying information regarding the circumstances of this incident and we can promise the Woolwich community, and wider public, that our investigation will be thorough.' Adebolajo and Adebowale mowed down Lee Rigby in this car before hacking him to death in the street in front of horrified onlookers. The streak of blood in front of the car shows how they dragged his body into the street .

"A hero soldier was shot twelve times as he tried to charge down an army officer who launched a shooting rampage at his base killing thirteen people, a court martial heard today. Another victim of accused shooter Maj. Nidal Hasan was pregnant when she was gunned down by the Muslim psychiatrist who also inured 30 people when he opened fire in a crowded medical building at Fort Hood Texas in 2009. Spc. Frederick Greene was shot 12 times during the attack, Lt. Col. Phillip Berran told the judge after reviewing photos of the soldier’s body before jurors were led into the courtroom at Fort Hood. When asked by a prosecutor if his findings were consistent with Greene 'charging the shooter,' the pathologist responded: 'Yes, it is.' Hero: Spc. Frederick Greene was shot 12 times as he courageously charged Hasan during the 2009 Fort Hood shooting . Evil: Nidal Hasan wants to become a martyr after killing 13 people - including a pregnant woman - during the shooting . Prosecutors chose not to introduce the photos as evidence. Greene, who was married with two children, was known around the base as the 'Silent Soldier' because of his mellow demeanor, according to Fox News. The 29-year-old was active at Baker's Gap Baptist Church in his hometown of Mountain City, Tennessee, while he was growing up, according to Glenn Arney, the church's former superintendent and a former co-worker. Greene's family issued a statement shortly after his death that said, ‘Fred was a loved and loving son, husband and father, and often acted as the protector of his family. ‘Even before joining the Army, he exemplified the Army values of loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity and personal courage. Many of his fellow soldiers told us he was the quiet professional of the unit, never complaining about a job, and often volunteering when needed.’ The Army newspaper Stars and Stripes reported that Greene was struck so many times that it was difficult to determine the path the bullets took, and the pathologist had to use a metal rod to determine the trajectory. Another victim, Pvt. Francheska Velez, was shot once by a bullet that fractured her rib and went through her heart and right lung — a wound that wasn’t survivable, said pathologist Col. AbuBakr Marzouk. When asked if the 21-year-old Chicago woman had any other significant medical conditions, Marzouk replied: 'She was pregnant.' Witnesses testified earlier in the trial that they would hear Velez crying out, 'My baby! My baby!' during the shootings. Berran also described how Pfc. Aaron Nemelka, 19, who was struck three times, was likely shot while lying on the ground. That means at least five victims were killed while lying down, according to testimony from several pathologists this week. Martyr: Hasan's attorneys feel he's trying to sabotage his case so he gets the death penalty and becomes a martyr . Berran told Hasan's court-martial that Nemelka, the youngest of the massacre victims, suffered intensely as his organs filled with blood. It was 'not an immediately fatal wound,' Berran said. Retired Major Clifford Hopewell, who was Chief of Traumatic Brain Injury and worked in a building near to where Hasan opened fire, testified Thursday that he ran out of his office when he heard the thunder of bullets and people screaming. He said he saw bodies strewn outside the building, scooped up a fallen magazine cartridge, and later encountered his psychiatrist colleague, Hasan. 'He was laying prone on the ground and he wasn't moving ... I thought he was dead,' said Clifford, who was the first person to officially identify him to authorities. Hasan — who is acting as his own attorney — raised no objections and didn’t question any of the witnesses Thursday, which has largely been his strategy since the trial began last week. The Army psychiatrist’s lack of defense so far has allowed prosecutors to call more than 70 witnesses, indicating that the trial could wrap up far sooner than the months-long timeline originally announced by the judge. The military defense attorneys who have been ordered to help Hasan during the trial have accused Hasan of trying to convince jurors to convict him and sentence him to death. Hasan has disputed those claims, calling them a twist of the facts. Victim: These are the 13 people killed during the attack. Private Velez was pregnant and was heard screaming 'my baby! My baby!' But he recently authorized the release of a report that shows he told military mental health experts after the attack that he 'would still be a martyr' if he were convicted and executed by the government. The report was released by Hasan’s civil attorney to the New York Times, which posted it online, but prosecutors were ordered by the judge not to read it. The military Judge, Colonel Tara Osborn, ended court earlier than planned Thursday because Hasan told her he had been sitting upright since he woke up at 4am. He has to adjust himself frequently. If convicted, Hasan could face the death penalty. The 13-member jury of officers must unanimously find Hasan guilty of premeditated murder for him to be executed. The U.S. military has not executed a service member since 1961.","Another one of the victims, Private Francheska Velez, was pregnant when she was fatally shot, allegedly by Nidal Hasan .

"They have helped writers dream up imaginary worlds and pops stars pen some of the biggest hits of the 1960s. But until now, scientists were unsure what happens to the brain under the influence of psychedelic drugs, such as magic mushrooms and LSD. New research shows that the brain enters a dream-like state when on a drug trip, and scientists hope it their findings help treat people battling depression. Scientists were unsure what happens to the brain under the influence of psychedelic drugs, such as LSD, which was particularly popular in the 1960s (a Cream album is pictured) but now they have mapped brain activity triggered by psilocybin - the active ingredient in magic mushrooms . The study, . published in the journal Human Brain Mapping mapped the brain activity . of 15 volunteers injected with the psychedelic chemical, psilocybin - . the active ingredient in magic mushrooms. The . findings revealed 'fascinating' similarities with brains scanned while a . person is dreaming, supporting the idea people on psychedelic drugs . enter dream-like states. Psilocybin was found to increase activity in the parts of the more primitive parts of the brain linked to emotional thinking, prompting several regions to become active at once. However volunteers who had taken the drug showed 'uncoordinated' activity in those areas of the brain linked to high-level thinking, including self-consciousness. Psychedelic drugs are unique among other psychoactive chemicals because users often experience ‘expanded consciousness', including enhanced associations, vivid imagination and dream-like states. Scientists looked at the brain activity of the volunteers lying in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner while some were under the influence of psilocybin and and others were injected with a placebo. New research shows that the brain displays a similar pattern of activity when on a drug trip - induced by a chemical in magic mushrooms called psilocybin - as it does while dreaming. A molecular model is pictured . ‘What we have done in this research is . begin to identify the biological basis of the reported mind expansion . associated with psychedelic drugs,’ said Dr Robin Carhart-Harris from . the Department of Medicine, Imperial College London. ‘I was . fascinated to see similarities between the pattern of brain activity in a . psychedelic state and the pattern of brain activity during dream sleep, . especially as both involve the primitive areas of the brain linked to . emotions and memory. Scientists have started to unravel what happens to the brain under the influence of psychedelic drugs such as magic mushrooms (pictured) ‘People . often describe taking psilocybin as producing a dreamlike state and our . findings have, for the first time, provided a physical representation . for the experience in the brain.’ The . researchers examined variation in the amplitude of fluctuations in what . is called the blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal, which tracks . activity levels in the brain. This . revealed that activity in important brain networks linked to high-level . thinking in humans becomes unsynchronised and disorganised under . psilocybin. One particular network that was especially affected plays a central role in the brain, essentially ‘holding it all together’ and is linked to our sense of self. In . comparison, activity in the different areas of a more primitive brain . network became more synchronised under the drug, indicating they were . working in a more co-ordinated, ‘louder’ fashion. The . network involves areas of the hippocampus, associated with memory and . emotion and the anterior cingulate cortex which is related to states of . arousal. Lead . author Dr Enzo Tagliazucchi from Goethe University, Germany said: ‘A . good way to understand how the brain works is to perturb the system in a . marked and novel way. 'Psychedelic drugs do precisely this and . so are powerful tools for exploring what happens in the brain when . consciousness is profoundly altered. 'It is the first time we have used these . methods to look at brain imaging data and it has given some fascinating . insight into how psychedelic drugs expand the mind. Dr Carhart-Harris said: 'We will be looking at the possibility that psilocybin may help alleviate symptoms of depression (illustrated with a stock image) by allowing patients to change their rigidly pessimistic patterns of thinking . Under the influence of psilocybin, activity in the more primitive brain network linked to emotional thinking became more pronounced. Several different areas in this network - such as the hippocampus and anterior cingulate cortex - appear to be active at the same time. This pattern of activity is similar to the pattern observed in people who are dreaming. It also made activity in the brain area linked to high-level thinking, including self-consciousness, more uncoordinated. 'It really provides a window through which to study the doors of perception.’ Dr Carhart-Harris added: ‘Learning about the mechanisms that underlie what happens under the influence of psychedelic drugs can also help to understand their possible uses. ‘We are currently studying the effect of LSD on creative thinking and we will also be looking at the possibility that psilocybin may help alleviate symptoms of depression by allowing patients to change their rigidly pessimistic patterns of thinking. ‘Psychedelics were used for therapeutic purposes in the 1950s and 1960s but now we are finally beginning to understand their action in the brain and how this can inform how to put them to good use.’","Study examined the psychedelic chemical in magic mushrooms, called psilocybin, using data from fMRI brain scans .

"A Brazilian student who sold her virginity for £485,000 is yet again offering it up in another online auction, claiming she the original deal was never consummated. Catarina Migliorini, 21, is selling her 'virginity' to bidders for the minimum of £62,000, but says she hopes for at least £930,000 ($1.5million). Miss Migliorini's original 'virginity auction' was filmed for an Australian documentary, but she claims she was duped by filmmaker Justin Sisely, and that she was never given the money a Japanese man paid for her purity last October. Scroll down for video . Virgin or victim? Brazilian student Catarina Migliorini sold her virginity for $780,000 after she put it up for auction online; but she is now claiming she is a victim who was exploited into selling her body . The original auction made Miss Migliorini a minor celebrity in Brazil and she posed for Playboy in her native country and Argentina. 'After being featured by so many media outlets in so many countries, I decided to actually auction off my virginity,' she explains to The Huffington Post regarding her decision to yet again sell her virginity. Miss Migliorini previously said she wanted to give 90 per cent of the final auction sale price to a non-governmental organization constructing modern houses in her southern home state of Santa Catarina. However, as she claims never to have been given the money - nor lost her virginity - the organisation has yet to receive her help. In October last year, Natsu, 53, a Japanese millioniaire fended . off strong competition from American bidders Jack Miller and Jack . Right, and Indian big-spender Rudra Chatterjee, to secure a date with the physical education student - who . said she would use the cash to build homes for poverty-stricken families. Tricked? The physical education student claims she has not received the money promised to her by filmmaker Justin Sisely, and believes the auction was simply a publicity stunt for Australian documentary, Virgins Wanted . The auction was supposedly part of an . Australian documentary entitled Virgins Wanted, in which Mr Sisley . would explore the lives of Miss Migliorini and Alex Stepanov, a male who . auctioned his virginity for $3,000. But . when Miss Migliorini went to meet her winning bidder, Natsu, in a . Sydney restaurant, she claims that he didn't match the description Mr . Sisely had given her, and insists the pair did not have sex. She also claims Mr Sisely did not cover her traveling expenses, or give her the £485,000paid by Natsu; and she now believes that 'Natsu' doesn't exist, and that the auction was simply a ploy to gain media coverage for the documentary. 'I . agreed to go along with [the auction], because Justin said it would be . the best way to draw attention from the media about the project,' she said. Mr Sisely, who first announced the . documentary in May 2010 and said it would conclude with both of the . virgins having sex, denies her claims. 'We have the footage to prove otherwise,' he explained. In a bid to avoid prostitution laws, Miss Migliorini was to be . 'delivered' to her buyer on board a plane between Australia and the U.S. - being interviewed before and after the sexual act. The intercourse itself would not be filmed, said Mr Sisely, . and Natsu would retain a right to be anonymous, without his picture . appearing in the media. Both . Migliorini's original claims of virginity and this time around have . been treated with suspicion by medical professionals as it there is no . foolproof way of telling if a woman is a virgin. Miss . Migliorini signed up to the project three years ago when she saw an . advert by Thomas Williams Productions looking for a virgin to film.","Catarina Migliorini, 21, is yet again selling her virginity online .

Residents of Trois-Rivieres were woken by the woman's anguished cries as she was repeatedly struck by her car in a bizarre accident. The woman had been making her regular newspaper delivery in Trois-Rivieres earlier this week, when her automatic car slipped into reverse as she got out. As she got out of the car, it lurched backwards and the open car door knocked her under the wheels.

"U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry was looking to strengthen ties with Russia as he tries to put an end to the dictatorial regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, but instead he was met with the coldest of receptions. Russian President Vladimir Putin kept Kerry waiting three hours before their meeting at the Kremlin on Tuesday and continuously fiddled with his pen as the top American diplomat spoke about the ongoing crisis in Syria. Kerry’s visit to Moscow comes as he seeks Russian help in ending Syria's civil, telling President Putin that common interest in a stable Middle East could bridge divisions among the big powers. The brush off: Unlike the pomp and circumstance of most diplomatic visits, Russian President Vladimir Putin kept U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry waiting for three hours before their appointed meeting time . Putin, however, made no mention in his own public remarks of the conflict in Syria, which has generated some of the frostiest exchanges between Washington and Moscow since the Cold War. Yet with the killing now in a third year and no end in sight as U.N. intervention remains stymied by international arguments, Kerry struck a positive tone as he set about trying to narrow differences sufficiently to agree a plan for a settlement that proved out of reach at talks in Geneva almost a year ago. 'The United States believes that we share some very significant common interests with respect to Syria - stability in the region, not having extremists creating problems throughout the region and elsewhere,' Kerry told Putin. 'We have both embraced in the Geneva communiqué a common approach, so it's my hope that today we'll be able to dig in to that a little bit and see if we can find common ground.' Keeping cordial: Putin and Kerry shook hands, but some other actions spoke louder, like his constant fiddling with his pen when Kerry spoke about the cooperation needed to take action against Assad . The United States and Russia endorsed a plan in Geneva last June that called for the creation of a transitional government in Syria, where at least 70,000 people have now been killed since March 2011, but which left open the question of what would happen to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Long-time arms supplier to Assad and suspicious of Western aid for opponents of authoritarian leaders around the world, Moscow says Assad's departure must not be a precondition for a dialogue among Syrians to end the conflict. Russia, backed by China, has refused Western appeals to consider sanctions on Assad, vetoing three U.N. Security Council resolutions condemning his crackdown on opposition groups. The United States are reluctant to give military aid directly to an insurgency that includes militant Islamists but alarmed that violence is continuing and may spread. The superpower is making a new push for a joint international approach to contain the conflict. Deal or no deal: Kerry has been pushing for Russia to help out, saying that it is just one of a handful of upcoming issues that are of mutual interest but he has yet to commit . Poker faces: The U.S. is trying to get Russia to act with them against the dictatorial Assad regime in Syria but the Russian leader has refused to publicly condemn the Syrian leader . Israeli air strikes in Syria have heightened a sense of urgency in a region strained by confrontations between Assad's ally Iran and other Arab powers, as well as the hostility between Israel and its neighbors, notably Iran and Hezbollah. Differences over Syria have deepened strains in ties between the United States and Russia that are also hampered by what Washington views as a crackdown on Russian civil society since Putin began a third term as president a year ago after the biggest protests since he first rose to power in 2000. Making the rounds: Kerry toured Red Square in Moscow during his visit, which is meant to be one to shore up Russian support . Kerry's visit is intended to help improve relations and pave the way Obama to hold talks with Putin in September, when Russia hosts a summit of the Group of 20 nations. Obama and Putin are also to meet at a Group of Eight summit in Britain in June. Kerry is publicly trying to hint how . there are many issues on the table- including ‘North Korea, Iran, Syria’ and economic cooperation- that could be good working ground for . U.S.-Russia relations. Putin, . a former KGB spy who accused Washington of helping foment protests . against him last year, was less effusive than Kerry but said he was glad . to see him in Moscow and expressed hope that relations would improve. Both . sides have said they hope to increase cooperation on counter-terrorism . following the Boston Marathon bombings, which U.S. officials suspect . were carried out by two ethnic Chechens who once lived in Russia.

"The saga of Anthony Weiner's mayoral campaign has come to a close as his wife was able to add in one final insult to her politician husband by refusing to accompany him to the primary polls this morning. Weiner said that his wife, Huma Abedin, had to take a call for work and was unable to accompany him to the polling station. In addition to this being a busy time in her personal life, this is busy for Abedin who has been Hillary Clinton's aide for decades and she spent the night before the election in D.C. attending a fundraiser for her boss. Instead the disgraced former Congressman took his son Jordan inside the voting booth with him on Tuesday as he cast his ballot, which well be the last time his name appears on such a paper. Aside from dealing with the crying toddler and struggling to get him back into his stroller, Weiner had another problem this morning: he almost wasn't able to vote for himself. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Big day: Weiner took his son Jordan into the voting booth with him but his wife Huma was nowhere to be seen . Different takes: Weiner gave a camera-ready grin while Jordan was crying . Daddy duty: The toddler did not seem excited about leaving the polling place either as his father put him in his stroller . When he arrived at his polling place . in New York's Flatiron neighborhood, his signature was not included in . the local polling book which is required for anyone casting a ballot. Poll . operators had to speak to a member of the Board of Elections who said . that his signature is on file and it was an administrative error that it . was left out of his local book. He joked that it was because he is 'not very well known'. The vote came hours after he gave his explosive final interview for his mayoral campaign, facing off with MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell who asked him point blank: 'What is wrong with you?' With the final pre-primary poll reporting that Weiner had seven per cent of Democratic support, O'Donnell said that it appeared that he had a psychological need to be in elective office. Last chance at the spotlight: Pundits believe this may be the last time that Weiner runs for elected office . Problem: Abedin stood by her husband when his latest sexting relationship was revealed in July . The . interview proceeded into a shouting match where O'Donnell said that . even when Weiner was out of office following his 2011 Twitter scandal, . he was doing 'the classic hack thing' by lobbying and plotting a return . to public life. Weiner . denied that, attacking O'Donnell for not allowing him to respond, but he . never gave a counter point to say what he did do during that time . except to say that he earned money to support his family. Previous . reports in The New York Times revealed in April that he and his wife brought in a combined salary of $496,000 in 2012. O'Donnell . did not attack Weiner's sexting habits- which he explained as 'just . standard american photography that is floating around the internet now'- . but took issue with 'your absolute desperate need for elective office . and what seems to be your inability to live outside of it'. Weiner then went on the defensive, . making jabs O'Donnell's show, his network, and the decision to avoid . talking about the issues that he believed appeal to New Yorkers. 'What is wrong with you?' MSNBC host Lawrence O'Donnell attacked Weiner's 'need to be in elective office' Expressive: Last night was not the first time that Weiner has gotten overheated during an interview . Watch full interview here . 'I don't understand the question. what . is wrong with me that I care so much about the issues that I fight for . every day that I have my entire career?' he responded. The shouting match was still ramped up . when the eight-minute video came to an end, so they continued for a . second segment that was available online. That was not his first problematic interview on Monday as he went into the last full day of the campaign with a rough attitude as he was rude and dismissive to Today's Savannah Guthrie when she brought up his wife Huma Abedin's diminished role in the campaign following the revelation of Weiner's sexting relationship with Sydney Leathers. 'I know you have this fascination about making this a soap opera but for citizens of the city of New York, a lot of them wanted this to be about the issues of the campaign,' he said. Weiner is no stranger to hecklers and he has gotten into repeated shouting matches with constituents during the campaign. The most memorable instance came recently when a Jewish Brooklyn resident reportedly chided him for marrying ‘an Arab’ and Weiner proceeded to call him a ‘jackass’. Back in the game: The Democratic race for city comptroller is very close and some polls have Eliot Spitzer (pictured today) leading while others have his opponent Scott Stringer . In the early days of the race to take over the mayor's seat when Michael Bloomberg leaves office this year, Weiner had a brief run in the lead, with some of the eight other Democratic candidates trailing closely behind. Now the race looks very different. Bill de Blasio, who previously served as the city's public advocate, went into Primary Day with 39 per cent of the Democratic vote while his main competition- Bill Thompson and Christine Quinne- both followed with 20 per cent each. If that 39 per cent does not turn into . 40 or more when the polls close at 9pm, there will be a run off among . the top Democrats to see who will face the Republican nominee in . November. The mayor's race . is not the only scandal-tainted race that the City will be putting an . end to on Tuesday as the competition to become the next comptroller . heated up when disgraced former Governor Eliot Spitzer threw his hat in . the ring alongside former Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer. The next first couple? Bill de Blasio, seen here with his wife Chirlane McCray, was leading among Democrats . A head above: De Blasio, seen voting on Tuesday, had 39 per cent of the vote while Bill Thompson and Christine Quinn were tied for second with 20 per cent . Looking for a run off: If no Democrat wins 40 per cent or more, a run-off occurs between the top two candidates, and that is the scenario that could keep Bill Thompson in the race .

"Controversy: Archbishop Jozef Michalik said that sex abuse was the result of people 'looking for love', and appeared to suggest that divorce could be just as harmful to children as paedophilia . The top Catholic bishop in Poland today blamed divorce for encouraging paedophilia by damaging young people. Archbishop Jozef Michalik said that sex abuse was the result of people 'looking for love', and appeared to suggest that divorce could be just as harmful to children as paedophilia. The controversial claims come as Poland's Catholic church faces mounting allegations of priests sexually abusing children. 'Many of these cases of molestation could be avoided given a healthy relationship between parents,' Archbishop Michalik told the PAP news agency. 'We often hear that this inappropriate attitude [i.e. paedophilia], or abuse, manifests itself when a child is looking for love. 'It clings, it searches. It gets lost itself and then draws another person into this.' While condemning paedophile priests 'whom neither the Church nor anyone else can accept,' the cleric also spoke out against divorce as being harmful to children. 'How many wounds are their in children's hearts, in children's lives, when their parents go their separate ways,' he said. 'Today nobody talks about divorce doing great harm to a child. It's obvious that sex abuse does great harm, one can't forget about it, but it's not the only thing.' In an unprecedented move, Polish church leaders apologised earlier this month for the actions of alleged paedophile priests, as prosecutors began probes against two high-profile suspects. Archbishop Jozef Wesolowski, a . 65-year-old Pole who served as a papal envoy in the Dominican Republic . for five years, is being investigated for allegedly having sex with . teenage boys. While condemning paedophile priests 'whom neither the Church nor anyone else can accept,' the cleric also spoke out against divorce as being harmful to children . Authorities in the Caribbean country are also investigating Wojciech Gil, a 36-year-old priest suspected of raping several young boys while serving there. Gil told Polish media last week the allegations were fabricated, claiming that Dominican drug gangs were trying to frame him. Despite the apology, Church leaders in Poland insist they will not be offering victims any material compensation. Unlike in countries such as the U.S. and Ireland, child sex abuse by priests in Poland has been a largely taboo subject and has so far not provoked widespread public outcry.","Archbishop Jozef Michalik says child abusers are 'looking for love'

"A 56-year-old woman and her five-year-old grandson miraculously emerged with minor injuries from a car accident after they were both run over on Tuesday in Anapolis in the state of Goias, Brazil. A split second after the accident happens, the youngster gets up and walks over to his grandmother, who is lying on the floor, as if nothing has happened. Both are already home after the accident after being discharged from hospital suffering from minor injuries. The incident was captured on CCTV cameras, which show the moment Vilma do Nascimento and João Pedro Nascimento were hit when a runaway car collided with a stationery vehicle pushing it into their path. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The car rolls right over the 5-year-old's head . The accident happened as the pair walked up an Anapolis street . The footage shows two people walking side by side in the road, just yards from the pavement. Up ahead, a car approaching the crossroads at speed from a road on the left of the screen crashes into another as it crosses the junction. Despite the efforts of the second car to swerve out of the way, the vehicle coming from the left fails to stop. The impact sends the car careering down the road where it collides with a stationery white car. Seeing the split-second accident unfold just metres in front of them, the grandmother grabs her grandson’s hand and rushes quickly towards the pavement in an attempt to avoid the car, which is hurtling towards them out of control. The white car barrels into Mrs Nascimento and João . The shocking footage shows how in a split second the pair were mown down . Miraculously the boy jumps straight back up and immediately goes to his grandmother's aid . But before they can reach safety the speeding car collides with the parked car shoving it into a reversed curved spin onto the pavement where it slams into the pair. The stationery car has been hit so hard, it races backwards only coming to rest seconds later after it has rolled over the victims twice – the body and head of the child and the legs and back of the women. Even as the accident is happening, the five-year-old manages to raise his head as he looks up to see where his grandmother has fallen – the lower half of his body is already under the car. A fraction of a second later the front wheel of the car rolls over the child’s head continuing over the grandmother’s back as she lays flattened on the floor by the impact. ‘I saw that the car run over him and come towards me. I thought my grandson’s skull had been crushed,’ Mrs Nascimento said in an interview with TV Anhanguera. But within seconds of it happening the youngster stands up making what appears to be an amazing recovery and walks over to his grandmother as if nothing has happened. The child later told reporters that he was more concerned about his grandmother than himself. ‘I thought my grandma had broken her spine and other things,’ he said. A passer-by who rushes to help the victims looks totally bewildered by what has just occured. ‘It was so quick. I tried to run to the sidewalk but unfortunately the stationary car hit us. It was a miracle we survived,’ the grandmother said. ‘I’m sure God’s hand protected us. João doesn’t even look like he’s been hit at all,’ she added showing off the bruises to her grandson’s face. Both are already home from hospital after undergoing a series of examinations. João was discharged on the same evening after the accident with minor abrasions to the right side of his face, chin and ear, and his grandmother was released Wednesday morning suffering from cuts and bruises to her legs and head. ‘The doctors said Joao’s injuries are just superficial. I’m not walking properly just yet but I have no fractures,’ Mrs Nascimento revealed. ‘It’s just amazing. João is already back playing with his friends and everyone is celebrating our survival.’ The drivers involved in the accident have both complained about the lack of signaling at the junction. The motorist who caused the accident denied speeding towards the intersection but admitted a degree of guilt. ‘I wasn’t paying attention as I approached the junction at the time but I don’t believe I was speeding,’ said Henrique Araújo, a sales representative. The other driver, João Birajara Camargo, also a salesman said: ‘I believe it was my right of way but I would have been able to avoid the accident if he hadn’t been speeding. I think he must have been doing at least 40kmph before he hit me.’ Anapolis local authority said it would be installing traffic lights before the end of the week.","Vilma do Nascimento and João Pedro Nascimento were hit by a runaway car .

"Germans are often considered to be more at one with nature than us prudish Brits. And now residents of the country's third-largest city have been given the go ahead to strip off for all over sunbathing sessions in six designated spaces. According to a report in TheAtlanticCities.com the six Urban Naked Zones are located in parkland, offering privacy, but also only minutes away from the busy city centre. All over tan: Munich has introduced six Urban Naked Zones in the city for nude sunbathing . The 'zones' were introduced following the expiry of statewide laws controlling nude sunbathing last year. The city's huge public park The Englischer Garten has been a nudist hang-out since the 1960s, with it's Schonfeldweise ('beautiful meadows') area being earmarked by nudist travel site naturisttravel.net  as one of the must-visit places in the country. They say: 'From the origins of the modern-day naturist movement to naked airlines and naked hotels, a lot has been written about the Germans’ fondness for taking their clothes off in public. For much of the population of Munich, it’s almost part of their DNA. No inhibitions: People Sunbathing at the Englishcer Garten . 'Whenever the sun is out, you’ll find Münchner of all ages, shapes and sizes catching some rays as nature intended. It’s considered as much the perfect lunchtime escape from the stresses of a busy day for office workers as it a place for friends and families to gather at weekends, and the atmosphere is always convivial and laid-back. 'This being Germany, there’s no embarrassment whatsoever about the fact that everybody is naked - the park is named the English Garden because of the original style of the horticulture, not as an ironic way of poking fun at traditional British prudery.' AtlanticCities.com reporter Feargus O'Sullivan said: 'What Germany does have is a strong cultural tradition that seeks to escape artifice and the pressures of city life to return to something supposedly more natural. Seen in this light, stripping off in public is the voluntary removal of a heavy mask, a return to unvarnished honesty rather than some titter-worthy peek-a-boo. Places where this is allowed to happen are spaces of truce, where there is a generally observed agreement that people will spare each other physical scrutiny and appraisal.' Clothing-optional sun-seeking has been a common practice across Germany since the first fully naturist beach was set up in 1920.","First naturist beach in Germany was set up in 1920 .

"When Prince George arrives in Sydney next Wednesday, diehard republicans will no doubt ­protest that he is just ­another over-privileged royal with no more right to reign over them in the future than a kangaroo. But, as I have discovered, the little ­fellow has rather more in common with the ­average Aussie than any of them could suspect. For I can reveal that through a horny-handed, sheep-­stealing ancestor, he is related to hundreds, ­possibly ­thousands, of modern Australians. Thanks to his grandmother, Carole ­Middleton, the eight-month-old Prince can trace his roots to a 19th-century farm labourer from Kent, who was found guilty of stealing three lambs and handed the obligatory sentence — transportation to Australia. Will Kate's blood link to Australial help in the Royal Family¿s continuing ­battle against the republican ­movement there? Surely this new-found blood link will help in the Royal Family’s continuing ­battle against the republican ­movement, which maintains a powerful voice in the country and wants a head of state who is Australian and who lives in the country. It will also, perhaps, strengthen the arguments of those who support the idea of Prince William becoming ­Governor-General of Australia when the incumbent Sir Peter Cosgrove retires in five years. George’s ties to some of those who will flock to see him next week are the result of a human drama which, in microcosm, tells the story of the ­forging of Australia itself. After transportation from Kent, farm labourer Samuel Hickmott started his new life in the young nation, breaking rocks as a member of a chain-gang. It would take ten years to win his freedom. Hickmott had a son, Henry, who ­married Sophia Goldsmith, ­Carole Middleton’s great-great-great aunt. That name has survived the many decades in between to be borne by the Duchess of ­Cambridge’s uncle, Gary ­Goldsmith. (Though he has never been accused of stealing sheep, he attracted a certain infamy when he was exposed as ­having offered cocaine and prostitutes to a reporter at his Ibizan villa, Maison de Bang Bang.) Over subsequent years, the ­Hickmott family’s descendants spread through every state of Australia. It had been in December 1839 that Samuel and his brother, ­Thomas, were arrested on the Brighton ­railway and accused of stealing the three lambs. The brothers were no better and no worse than many ­members of the 19th century underclass, ­suffering a combination of insufficient work, poor health, undernourishment and the withering effects of the Industrial Revolution. Both had been to jail and the workhouse. Sophia Elizabeth Goldsmith Hickmott, is Kate's ancestor. She married Hnery Hickmott, son of Samuel Hickmott . Of course, they were breaking the law, but, for them, it was the only way of feeding their starving families. Samuel had four children by two wives, but both women had died. With farm work hard to find, he had twice placed the children in the Lamberhurst poor house. He and his brother Tom served short jail terms for vagrancy, but, in their defence, the pair were the last to be chosen for any work because they were not able to read or write. When the Hickmott ­brothers were arrested, they were at the end of their tether. They appeared at Maidstone Assizes on January 2, 1840, and an open-and-shut case was put to the  judge. The brothers had stolen the lambs and the remains of the meat had been found in their houses. The ­prosecution, determined to get a conviction, ­produced the lambskins and the ­evidence of two local butchers. ­Thomas, of ‘a notoriously bad ­character’, was sentenced to be ­transported for life. His younger brother Samuel was sentenced to ten years’ transportation. But, ­effectively, that meant a life ­sentence — because convicts were not given a return ticket at the end of their sentence and rarely raised enough money to buy one. So, for the theft of three lambs, the Hickmott brothers were shipped to the other side of the world — Van ­Diemen’s Land, now Tasmania — with no hope of return. The 101-day journey across the high seas on the prison ship Asia was a ­living hell, and the brothers stepped ashore with great relief. But Samuel would spend the next ten years working on a chain-gang, breaking rocks and helping prepare roads on the island, 150 miles from the Australian mainland. There was never any hope of escape. While little is known of Thomas’s fate, the gruelling punishment did not break Samuel — far from it. Just over eight years after his ­conviction, he received a conditional pardon and was subsequently released. In a ­bullish mood, he sailed to South ­Australia, where he met up with one of his four sons, Henry. He  had been just 15 years old when he had last seen his father. He’d pledged to meet up with him again and start a new life in the ­emerging country, and so took his young bride, Sophia ­Goldsmith, whom he’d met in Kent where her family were the Hickmotts’ neighbours. Even in the fetid steerage cabins, the journey aboard the migrant ship Emily, accompanied by its sister-ship named — appropriately, you might say — Kate, was more luxurious by far for the newlyweds than it had been for Hickmott senior. The couple arrived in Botany Bay on September 9, 1850, and prepared themselves for an exhausting trip  across the vast continent to South Australia. The family tree, which Kate can trace back her Australian roots. The Duchess visits Sydney next week . Sophia Goldsmith was tall, dark and willowy. However, the marriage was not to last beyond its fifth year for, after producing three children, the youngest of whom was to rise to become a Member of Parliament, Sophia died. The Hickmotts — Samuel; his son Henry; and Henry’s son, Henry Edward — steeled themselves for rough times ahead. On his release, Samuel worked as a labourer, while his son Henry sweated it out in the local brickworks at Mount Barker, near Adelaide. The men were hard and they were ambitious. When the ­Australian Gold Rush began, all three travelled 300 miles south-west overland from Mount Barker to Clunes, near Melbourne, in the ­Victorian goldfields where father and son set to work all hours as ­miners, labourers and brickmakers. At the age of 72, after years of being toughened on the chain-gang, it is recorded that Samuel was still hard at work, helping build the ­family fortune — but his had been a supremely tough life and he died soon after. His son Henry and grandson Henry Edward moved to Charlton, in ­Victoria, where the rewards of their  hard labour allowed them to buy a farm and set up a brick-making business. Eventually, Henry Edward became a successful building and roads ­contractor — and the Hickmott family was on its way. Forty years after his grandfather had left ­England in chains, Henry Edward was poised to become the MP for Pingelly. His mother, Sophia Goldsmith, had died soon after he was born, but her name lived on in his first child, whom he named Sophia. Kate's links to Australia can be traced through her mother Carole Middleton . A portrait survives of this Sophia which, pleasingly for ­Australians, is ­strikingly similar to her kinswoman, the ­Duchess of Cambridge. So, what of the Goldsmiths who remained in England? The carpenter father of the Sophia who had sailed to Australia hated the shame brought upon the family by his daughter ­marrying the son of a sheep-stealer. Sophia’s brother, John, meanwhile, was little more than a labourer and brickmaker for most of his life. His son, also John, did the same — as did the next generation’s male ­progeny, Stephen. For a century, while the Hickmotts slaved away to improve their fortunes in Australia, the Goldsmiths trod water socially and professionally. Only when Stephen’s son, Ron ­Goldsmith, broke the mould by becoming an engineer and builder did things begin to look up. Ron’s ­marriage to Dorothy ­Harrison, the decidedly upwardly mobile daughter of a miner from Hetton-le-Hole, Tyne & Wear, sparked a further move up the social ladder. It was an upward trajectory that’s ended with the extraordinary achievements of their daughter, ­Carole Middleton, in producing a daughter who has become mother to the future king of Britain and Australia. While the Goldsmiths were ­making their way in the world, Down Under the Hickmott clan had grown fast. Henry Edward Hickmott — ­grandson of the convict Samuel — and his wife Elizabeth had 12 ­children, and it’s the numerous descendants of this couple — and those of his sisters, Eliza and Emma, who make up the nucleus of what may wryly be dubbed ‘the ­Australian Royal Family’. These three siblings — Henry Edward, Eliza and Emma — were Prince George’s first cousins, five times removed. Though with each generation the cousinage becomes watered down, ­descendants of these three Hickmotts have a right to claim kinship with the future king. Today, they range from blue-­collar workers through middle-class ­professionals to such well-known Australian figures as Brendon Grylls, an MP for Western Australia, and IT multi-millionaire Stanley Lewis. So, next week — though he won’t know it — Prince George will be among his people, his relatives. Support for the monarchy Down Under is at a 25-year high, and his presence will surely help the ­royals’ efforts to nurture the link between themselves and those we can now quite rightly call their Australian cousins. Who knows, one day George might get to meet all those rellies round the barbie.","Duchess can trace roots to farm labourer who was sent to Australia .

"Ched Evans was seen smiling in public today as it emerged trolls said they leaked his rape victim's new identity  - two years after she was forced to take a new name and flee her home because of bullies. The former Welsh international, 25, who was released from jail on Friday, was seen driven by his girlfriend Natasha Massey to her parents' home in Cheshire. The woman he attacked, 22, had to start a new life away from her friends and family in north Wales after nine people were convicted of illegally naming her in 2012. Back on the streets: Ched Evans grinned as he headed out shopping with his long-standing girlfriend Natasha Massey . Evans with girlfriend Massey left jail on Friday after serving exactly half his five year prison sentence for rape . Evans was jailed in 2012 for raping a 19-year-old girl in a hotel room. He was convicted on the grounds that she had been too drunk to consent to sex . The young woman was named at least 6,000 times on Twitter alone following the conviction of Wales international Evans and was labelled a ‘slag’, ‘tramp’, ‘bitch’ and ‘whore’. Twitter trolls have continued to pursue her even though Evans was jailed for five years for raping her in a Rhyl hotel room. According to the Daily Star a blogger has now said he has leaked her old name  and now her new name, including who she lives with. North Wales Police are yet to comment. Another Twitter message, referring to her real name said: 'Her first name is: *****  Her second name is: *****  and she's a f****** liar'. The attempts to expose her caused fury online with many calling for them to be prosecuted. Out and about: Ched Evans pictured arriving at partner Natasha Massey's parents' home earlier today . Couple: Evans has failed to apologise to his victim but has praised his girlfriend Natasha Massey, 25, right, for standing by him . The pair spent one of his first days of freedom at the shops before heading back to her parents home . Evans, right, who was freed on Friday after serving half his five-year sentence, is to have a review of his conviction fast-tracked by the Criminal Cases Review Commission . Natasha Massey arrives at her parents home in Alderley Edge, Cheshire today carrying bags of shopping . Victim: Ched Evans' victim's  new identity has apparently been published by trolls. She moved away from her friends and family, because of the abuse she suffered after being raped . Illegal naming carries a maximum fine of £5,000. Mollie Goodfellow  tweeted: 'Ched Evans' appeal gets fast-tracked, and his victim has to change her identity and move from her home? So much for justice.'‏ . @LeanneSpurs wrote: 'Hasn't she suffered enough? SHE'S the victim NOT him!' Police put the ‘relocation package’ together after her lifelong anonymity — protection afforded to anyone who has been subjected to a sexual assault — was breached on the internet. Some of the abuse amounted to ‘psychological GBH’, to use the description of one senior detective, which left the girl ‘traumatised’. Hence the decision to give her a new identity, the first time, it is believed, a rape victim has been given such help in these circumstances. The girl, now 22, had drunk two large glasses of wine along with four double vodkas and a sambuca on the night she was raped. But the jury agreed that she could not have consented to sex with Evans. In further pain for the victim it emerged yesterday that Evans, who was freed on Friday after serving half his five-year sentence, is to have a review of his conviction fast-tracked by the Criminal Cases Review Commission. It normally takes 18 months to examine a miscarriage of justice claim but Evans’ application will be considered ‘within weeks’ after fresh evidence was put forward by his legal team. The Commission said its decision ‘does not in any way represent a judgment as to the merits of the case or its chances of being referred to the Court of Appeal’. The move has caused concern among rape campaigners. Rape Crisis England and Wales said: ‘We’re concerned that survivors’ voices and feelings [should] not be lost or overlooked in the furore surrounding one high-profile rapist’s release.’ Free: Evans is now out of prison having served half his sentence and his girlfriend Natasha Massey, 25 (right), has stood by him . Anger: Twitter uses have reacted to the news that Evans' victim may have been named again by trolls . Everyday Victim Blaming (EVB) said: ‘Rehabilitation requires remorse. Evans has continuously denied that he committed rape.’ Evans was jailed in 2012 for raping a 19-year-old girl in a hotel room. He was convicted on the grounds that she had been too drunk to consent to sex. An appeal against Evans’s conviction was rejected by three judges at the court of appeal in 2012. On Friday Ched Evans was being whisked out of Wymott prison in a blacked-out Mercedes having served half of his sentence for rape. This morning he is believed to be on the verge of signing a £500,000 contract with his old football club, Sheffield United. The deal, worth up to £5,000-a-week, could see him back in training by next week, according to The Sun. However, as a condition of the contract Evans - who still maintains he is innocent - must make a public apology. He has been left with little choice, as the club is the only one to have made him an offer, the paper claims. In an interview in the Sunday Mirror, the former Sheffield United and Wales footballer – who hopes to resume his career – failed to apologise to his victim but praised his girlfriend Natasha Massey, 25, for standing by him. ‘I regret everything that happened and wish I could turn back the clock,’ he said. ‘I am very lucky my girlfriend Tasha has stood by me. She knows I am not capable of rape. ‘I want to play football again, but I am determined to prove my innocence. ‘I really thought it would have been thrown out of court. I was stunned when I was convicted. I had done nothing wrong.’ Some fans at Sheffield United are asking the club to re-sign Evans saying he has served his sentence and should be rehabilitated. But more than 150,000 people have signed an online petition urging the Bramall Lane club not to welcome him back. TV presenter Judy Finnigan sparked controversy last week by claiming his crime was ‘non violent’ and did not cause ‘bodily harm’ during a panel discussion on ITV’s Loose Women. Her comments caused a wave of outrage and abuse on social media and also sparked threats against her daughter, fitness instructor Chloe, wishing rape on her.

"A plastic surgeon has been indicted after he performed liposuction on a heart transplant survivor, authorities said on Thursday. Dr Oleg Davie, from Brooklyn, New York, has been indicted on manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide charges in the death of Isel Pineda. District Attorney Charles J. Hynes said that doctors are discouraged from performing liposuction on patients with heart disease. He alleges Davie 'recklessly' performed the procedure and falsified forms to conceal his knowledge of Pineda's medical history. Disgraced: Oleg Davie, of Brooklyn, New York, has been indicted on criminally negligent homicide charges after a history of misconduct . Tragic: Heart transplant survivor Isla Pineda died following the botched plastic surgery which she should have never been cleared for . Miss Pineda went into cardiac arrest in his office after the May 2012 procedure and died at Coney Island hospital. The name of Davie's attorney was not immediately known. Miss Pineda, a former model, should . never have been on the operating table having had a heart transplant in . in 2004. The major surgery made it unsafe for her to be given . anesthesia. Davie, a disgraced . plastic surgeon who was banned at the time from carrying out anything more invasive that . wart removal or Botox, ignored Pineda's poor health history and . performed lucrative 'SmartLipo' on her. Paperwork found in Pineda's purse by her boyfriend suggested Davie knew about her heart disease and resulting life-saving operation that made her unsuitable for liposuction. On it were details of the diagnosis and the anti-rejection rejection drugs she was taking. Davies appeared to have ignored the health issues when filling out Pineda's patient history form, on which he clearly marked 'no' where it asks whether she had ever been hospitalized. Lucrative: Pineda paid $3,200 for the procedure, described in online ads as being to 'lose the wobble' He wrote that she had a 'mid-chest, old, well-healed' scar, describing it as resulting from 'skin surgery' to remove a 'cyst'. Pineda's scar would have stretched from the neck to her navel. While her family believe she didn't tell them she was having lipo due to embarrassment, she was never shy about discussing her heart transplant. 'Anyone who met Isel knew she was a heart-transplant patient. She wore that label proudly, even posting it on her Facebook page,' said the family’s lawyer, Michael Fruhling. 'That Dr. Davie failed to mention this is beyond comprehension.' Revealing: Pineda's boyfriend found copies of her paperwork in her purse . Pineda paid $3,200 for the procedure, described in online ads as being to 'lose the wobble'. She went into cardiac arrest before leaving Davie's office. Paramedics tried to revive her but she was declared dead at Coney Island Hospital. The Health Department had banned Davie from a series of procedures due to a history of misconduct. Davies has been cited in seven malpractice suits for negligence in which he was fined $100,000 and put on probation for three years. Other patients have complained of burns and disfigurement.","Dr Oleg Davie, from Brooklyn, has been indicted on manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide charges in the death of Isel Pineda .

"Buying Viagra could become much cheaper from midnight tonight, as the UK patent for the drug expires . A cut-price battle for the £1.5billion market in Viagra begins today after the impotence drug’s patent expired at midnight last night. With prices predicted to tumble quickly to as little as a tenth of the current rate, men in need of a boost in the bedroom could be able to obtain the little blue pills for as little as 60p each. Until now, those who do not qualify for an NHS prescription have faced paying up to £6 per tablet. But while expiration of the patent will make the drug more affordable, it will not make it more easily available, because men will still need a prescription –private or NHS – to get it. Around a dozen companies are expected to market generic, or non-branded, versions of the impotence drug from today. And at least ten more have also made tablets and have permission to sell them. Pfizer, which developed Viagra at its plant in Sandwich in Kent, has held the patent since 1990 and sold the drug at a price that allowed it to recoup the money spent on development. Worldwide, sales are worth almost £1.5billion a year. It will be launching a non-branded version today. Among its competitors will be Teva, a manufacturer of generic medicines that is the biggest supplier of drugs to the NHS and whose products range from cold treatments to cancer drugs. A spokesman for the West Yorkshire-based firm said: ‘We fight cat and dog with other companies to be the first on the market when a patent expires.’ Viagra is a blue, diamond-shaped pill and while the copycats will come in different shapes, sizes and colours they will all contain the same active ingredient – a substance called sildenafil. Most will simply be marketed under that name after satisfying drug regulators that they work as well as the real thing. Other versions of the blue pill, which will not be available under the same brand name, are predicted to be marketed from tomorrow for as little as 60p per tablet . Cheaper copycat versions will provide enormous savings to the NHS, which spends more than £40million a year on the medicine. Among patients, the biggest winners . will be those who don’t qualify for pills on the NHS – the 150,000 or so . of the 750,000 Britons who take Viagra each year. They currently pay around £24 for . four tablets obtained with a private prescription. They are being urged . by Paul Fleming, of the British Generic Manufacturers Association, to . ensure that their doctor makes the prescription out for sildenafil. ‘It is those patients who will . directly benefit from the price fall,’ he said. ‘We’d expect the . dramatic fall to feed its way through to the private market.’ The NHS currently prescribes Viagra . only to men with underlying health problems, such as diabetes or . prostate cancer.
