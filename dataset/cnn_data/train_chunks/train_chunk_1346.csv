"A new type of 'legal high' could be developed into a drug that can help to stop people from binge drinking while still giving them a buzz. The inventor, who was also behind the banned substance mephedrone, has filed a patent application for the substance through a dutch charity. The drug, known as MEAI, gives users a feeling of intoxication similar to the party drug ecstasy while limiting the amount of alcohol they drink. Scroll down for video . Chapron drugs could help curb the binge drinking culture by removing the desire to drink during a night out . Now scientists at Imperial College London are hoping to use the compound to develop what they are calling a 'Chaperon' as a way of tackling the binge drinking problem. Around one in ten deaths in working age adults are due to excessive alcohol use and it accounts for 3.3 million deaths a year worldwide. Journalist Michael Slezak is among the few to have tried the potential chaperon drug MEAI. Despite the risks of taking an unlicensed and untested drug, he decided to try 5-methoxy-2-aminoindane after asking scientists to conduct a few toxicity tests. During a night out drinking with friends he took a small dose and then began drinking two hours later, slowly upping his dose of MEAI as he did. After four hours he said he began to feel a relaxed high. More than five hours after the first does, he said he felt 'intense but controlled euphoria'. Writing for New Scientist he said that at that stage 'the idea of drinking alcohol seems repuslive - as does eating bar food'. He said: 'My friends later described my behaviour as rational, if a little tense. 'The drug didn't stop me from sleeping and I had no anxiety or depression in the following days. So it seems like a party drug without some of the side effects. 'My experience is not a scientific study. It took a lot of the drug to make me want to stop drinking and by then I felt both drunk and high.' Professor David Nutt, a psychopharmacologist at Imperial College London and a former Government drugs adviser, now believes Chaperon drugs that reduce the desire to drink may provide a way of tackling the problem. He believes MEAI is a potential 'binge mitigator' that could be taken at the start of a night out to kick in after a couple of hours to remove the users desire to drink anymore while still giving them a pleasurable feeling that makes people want to drink in the first place. The drug's designer, a mathematician known by his pseudonym Dr Z, has agreed to gift the patent to Professor Nutt's charitable research group DrugScience, to help fund research on Chaperons. Professor Nutt told Mail Online: 'The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recently signed off on a drug called Selincro for use by alcoholics as it stops the loss of self control they suffer from. 'That got us thinking about another way to approach the problem which would be to take away people's desire to drink. 'What tends to happen is that people go out for just a couple of pints but after having them something changes in their brain and they then end up drinking far more than they intended, causing them to end up in trouble. 'We are looking for ways to stop this switch from flipping in the first place. We are looking at around 80 substances and MEAI is one of those.' Many of the potential chaperon substances being investigated by Professor Nutt were previously patented as drugs to treat other conditions such as depression but failed to ever make it to market. He said they were now hoping to repurpose these compounds for other uses. Professor David Nutt and his DrugScience charity is looking at 80 substances that could potentially be used as 'Chaparon' drugs that revellers can take during a night out to reduce their risk of binge drinking . MEAI was developed by Dr Z (pictured), the drug designer behind several legal highs including mephedrone . Mephedrone was sold over the internet as plant food before it was banned after being linked to several deaths . So far around 40 people, including its inventor Dr Z, have tried MEAI but no laboratory tests or clinical trials have been carried out. One person said they did not enjoy the experience while others have said it made them feel euphoric. Some have reported losing the desire to drink within around two hours of taking the substance. One journalist for New Scientist who has tried MEAI said it took five hours before drinking alcohol became 'repulsive' Also called 5-methoxy-2-aminoindane, MEAI is a ring shaped compound known as an aminoindane. It is structurally similar to two other 'legal highs' invented by Dr David Nichols from Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indianna - MDAI and MMAI - that mimic the euphoric effects of ecstasy. Binge drinking is a major problem in many cities at weekends but it can also lead to long term illnesses . However, MEAI also looks like another drug, PMA, which is known to be highly toxic. In neurotransmitters, just a small change to the structure and chemical groups on a compound can produce dramatic differences in how they work. Currently drug laws in Europe and North America only ban the use and sale of specific substances. This means new compounds developed by chemists can be sold without fear of prosecution until they are added to the list of controlled substances. In many cases, production of these new drugs is currently outstripping the ability of the authorities to keep up by making them illegal. The growing problem of legal highs came to the public's attention following a series of deaths among users. Taking a chaperon drug similar to MEAI at the start of a night out could stop people from drinking too much . Mephedrone, created by Dr Z and sold over the internet as plant food, caused at least one death and has been implicated in at least 13 others. However, there are some who believe these new substances could provide new forms of treatment if tested properly. Professor Nutt said he hopes to conduct scientific tests on chaperons in animals before attempting clinical trials to see if it could be useful. 'We are hoping to do testing in animal models and build up to clinical trials,' said Professor Nutt. 'However, all of this costs a lot of money and we need to raise funding for it, which is what we are hoping the MEAI patent will help with.' Speaking to New Scientist, he added: 'We have to see this as an opportunity to reduce harms rather than a new drug that has hit the market.' However, Dr Nichols warned that it was difficult to predict how drugs like MEAI would behave in the brain and whether they might also do more harm than good. He told New Scientist: 'There really is no good way to predict biological activity in a completely novel structure.'","The drug, called MEAI, was developed by the inventor of mephedrone .

"The alleged gunman believed to have killed eight people in a string of shootings throughout Edmonton, Canada before turning the gun on himself was described as 'depressed and overly emotional' by concerned family members just before the tragic murder-suicide. Though the assailant has yet to be officially identified, it's believed that the man found dead in a restaurant at the end of the bloody day is 53-year-old Phu Lam. Edmonton Police Chief Ron Knecht spoke out about the tragic incident on Tuesday, saying police were called to a home, which appears to be owned by Lam, Monday evening after his family became concerned about his well being. Scroll down for video . Chilling: Police remove one of the eight victims from a home in Edmonton, Alberta, Tuesday morning . 'According to the family, the male seemed depressed and overly emotional,' Knecht said. 'The family was concerned the male might be suicidal.' Monday, December 29 . 6.52pm: Officers respond to a 'weapons complaint' at a house in southern Edmonton and discover the body of 37-year-old Cyndi Duong. 8.28pm: An emergency call raises concerns for the welfare of a man - suspected to be Phu Lam, 53 - at a house in north Edmonton. He is seen 'depressed and overly emotional' and a family is concerned he may be suicidal. Neither he nor his vehicle is found, but they do not force their way into the house. Tuesday, December 30 . 12.23am: Officers return to the same house after 'further investigation and significant disclosure by a second individual'. This time they do force their way inside and find seven bodies - three women, two men, and a boy and a girl both aged under ten - after apparent 'planned and deliberate' murders. 2.20am: Officers find black SUV that matched description of vehicle connected to first murder outside a Vietnamese restaurant in Fort Saskatchewan, where the suspect has a 'business interest'. 8.45am: Officers establish man found dead in restaurant killed himself and was the man they had been looking for since the previous night. Seeing nothing suspicious, police left the scene. But they were called back just four hours later and inside found the bodies of seven people - including two children. It's currently unknown whether the seven inside were dead when police first arrived. Edmonton Police spokesman Scott Pattison spoke with Daily Mail Online on Wednesday, describing the officers' decision not to enter the home the first time as standard procedure for welfare checks. Pattison says they receive sometimes hundreds of calls a day to check in on people whose family are concerned about them. At the time of the first call, police had not yet connected the discovery of a body in the south of Edmonton to the welfare call at Lam's home in the north of town. By the time they received a second call several hours later, they had more information leading them to suspect something happened inside that they couldn't see through the windows. Pattison added that the bodies may have been dead inside the residence since Sunday, but that investigators are waiting on autopsy results to confirm the cause and time of death. Those results may be in as early as New Year's Day. 'This series of events are not believed to be random acts and there is no risk to the broader public,' Knecht said. 'These events do not appear to be gang related but rather tragic incidents of domestic violence.' Knecht added that authorities are not looking for any other suspects, which suggests that the gunman responsible is likely the man they later found shot to death in a restaurant in the next town. Eight victims: Police in Edmonton, Alberta, investigate a home where seven bodies, two of them children, were found Tuesday morning after reports of a suicidal man . Inside: Detectives scour the inside of a building in nearby Fort Saskatchewan, where officers found the alleged killer dead Tuesday morning . The Toronto Sun reported that Lam is thought to be the man in question, and was known to police before. Police were first called to an address in the south of the town, three hours north of Calgary in the Alberta province, following a weapons complaint Monday night. Inside, they found the body of  37-year-old Cyndi Duong, who had been shot dead after someone broke into her house, according to state broadcaster CBC. So far, Duong is the only victim who has been identified. It was after finding the gruesome scene that they were called to the home owned by Pham to the north of the city, on the request of his concerned family members. While the officers checked on the door, they did not find anything suspicious and left the residence. Murder after murder: The above map shows the sites where dead bodies were found by police in and around Edmonton . Murdered: The victim above is one of seven found in the same home, to which police were called in the evening before the killings happened . But when they were called back to the home after midnight, they found an even more horrifying scene: seven people shot to death including three women, two men  and two children,a little girl and a little boy. Duong shared the home where she was found dead with David Luu, 41, according to property records viewed by the Edmonton Journal. Further records reportedly showed the home where seven more bodies were found is owned by Phu Lam and a 35-year-old woman named as Thuy-Tien Truong. According to the Journal, Truong was sued by the Royal Bank in 2013 and Lam filed a bankruptcy proposal in the same year. Neighbours told the Journal a couple with two children - an eight-year-old named locally as Elvis and a toddler - lived in the house alongside an elderly woman. Police later tracked down the suicidal man to a Chinese and Vietnamese restaurant in Fort Saskatchewan, a town outside Edmonton, to which Lam has been linked. Officers located a black Mercedes SUV Lam is thought to have been driving. 'Senseless mass murder': Edmonton police chief Rod Knecht spoke at a conference about the spree of murders . Explanation: Chief Knecht said the killings seem to be the result of domestic violence . Tragedy: The police chief said it was the city's worst mass killing since another in 1956 . Police found the vehicle at around 2.30am, but waited until morning to raid the restaurant, where the man was found. Witnesses then described officer blowing down the door, and sending police dogs and robot . When they entered around 8.45am on Tuesday, the man was dead - apparently after killing himself. Police say there is no further danger to the public. Chief Knecht said: 'Our homicide investigators have established associations and linkages between these homicides.' Police would not elaborate on the connection between the deaths.","Police found eight bodies, including a girl and a boy, in Edmonton, Canada .

"This video shows the dramatic moment an off-duty police officer slammed a screaming woman into the side of a car. The pair were captured struggling in a parking lot after the woman reportedly rear-ended the officer's car in San Jose, California. The officer was dressed in shorts and sunglasses and is said to have shown no badge, but police later confirmed they employed him - adding the woman in the video bit him. Scroll down for video . Clash: A video has emerged showing the moment an off-duty police officer slammed a screaming woman into the side of a car. Police in San Jose, California, said it happened in September after her car hit the officer's . Grappling: The video shows the officer wrestling with the woman by the side of what appears to be his car . Although San Jose police say the incident happened in September, the video shot by a passer-by emerged on LiveLeak just a few days ago. It shows the confrontation already well under way, with what appears to be the officer's white Honda parked at a jaunty angle in the parking lot as he grapples with her and shouts: 'Call police!' The woman's sister tries to call him off, to which the man filming the video replies: 'He's a cop'. The pair struggle for a moment longer before the off-duty officer, who has not been named, slams the woman forcefully into the side of the car before hauling her up and holding her over the bonnet. The woman's sister comes to her aid despite the officer shouting: 'Back off! Back off!'. Impact: The officer slams the woman into the side of the car, where she lands with an audible thump . Struggle: He then hauls her up onto the bonnet before both turn around to see that they are being filmed . Only when she holds the officer back is her sister able to escape, after which the pair both jump into their vehicle and drive off with tires screeching. The video prompted a furious response on LiveLeak by users who accused the officer of over-reacting and made comparisons to the use of force in Ferguson and New York. One commenter wrote: 'Why would you try to arrest someone while out of uniform if no ones life is in danger? He could have just followed them, got their license plate, got a description of the driver and maybe taken a pictures with his phone. 'Just another example of an a****** cop hyped up off of adrenaline, coffee and steroids, trying to show his bravado!' But the San Jose Police Department hit back when contacted by CBS San Francisco. Intervention: The woman's sister gets involved to try and restrain the officer so she can get away . Fleeing: The pair later escaped with a screech of tires. San Jose police said there were outstanding warrants for both women, one of which bit the officer during the confrontation sparked by a car shunt . Sergeant Heather Randol told the news station the woman in the video had rear-ended the off-duty policeman, so he followed her and tried to detain her until uniformed officers arrived. She claimed the woman bit the officer before fleeing the scene, and an assessment of the officer's use of force was carried out at the scene. 'Both women have outstanding misdemeanor warrants for their arrests,' said Randol, adding they were accused of a hit and run and using force against an officer.","Police in San Jose, California, said the unknown woman bit their officer .

"There can be no doubt that 2014 has been a stellar year for George Clooney, with the sworn bachelor finally tying the knot with international lawyer Amal Alamuddin. And, now, topping off a triumphant 12 months, George's decades of unfaltering style have been acknowledged as he is crowned Male Grooming Icon of 2014. Ever since setting hearts aflutter in ER in the Nineties, George has championed a suave, clean shaven look, setting the standard for silver foxes everywhere, which saw him claim an impressive third of the total votes. George Clooney has been awarded the title of Male Grooming Icon in this triumphant year for the star which saw him finally walk down the aisle with lawyer Amal Alamuddin . George even managed to topple David Beckham from his usual place atop all UK stylish men charts. David, who sits at the number two position, who has long led the way when it comes to grooming, championing the hair quiff, fake tan and eyebrow threading over his career. James Bond himself, Daniel Craig takes third place, championing the traditional British look. The dapper actor most recently showcased his rugged charms at the press launch of the forthcoming Bond epic Spectre. Prince William, so often overlooked in favour of his wife the Duchess of Cambridge - who topped Superdrug's annual Beauty Icons survey from 2011 to 2013 - comes in at number four, while the evergreen Johnny Depp rounds off the top five. The quintessential metrosexual David Beckham may have been knocked off the top spot but he hasn't fallen far, taking second place for his high level of grooming -with or without beard . Other names included in the top ten include noted smoothies Michael Buble and Gary Barlow, at seven and nine respectively, with Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch closing the top ten. Younger stars to make an high appearance on the list include Strictly star Mark Wright at number 15, Robert Pattinson at 19 and Brooklyn Beckham at 22. Romeo Beckham makes an appearance at number 26, showing that at 12 years old it's never too early to start making an effort. David Cooke, head of men's grooming and personal care at Superdrug, which conducted the survey, said: 'Mr Clooney is a perfect example of modern male grooming, polished and sophisticated without compromising his masculinity. Daniel Craig and Prince William take third and fourth place respectively for their traditional looks . 'What's interesting about this list is that it's older male celebs that lead the charge, with the youngest in our top ten being Prince Harry and Olly Murs both aged 30, and George the oldest at 52. In fact the combined age of our top ten in 399 years old, which perhaps substantiates the old adage about men getting better with age.' Dave Cooke added: 'Male grooming has really taken off in the last few years, with UK seeing a predicted increase in sales of men's products of more than £20million in the last two years. 'We're predicting 2015 to be the Year of the Man as more and more male shoppers wake up to the long term benefits of looking after their skin and hair. Who wouldn't want to look like George Clooney at his age?'","George is followed by Beckham and Daniel Craig in list .

"Hosting a soiree this New Year's Eve? Start with Prosecco, move on to gin or vodka, toast 2015 in with Champagne and round the celebrations off with a classic Martini. But avoid beer, red wine and shots if you want to last the night and still be liked by your friends the morning after. Scroll down for video . Happy New Year's! If you're hosting a party, steer clear of beer, red wine and shots and stick to Champagne . Ruairi Giles of The Bonneville French restaurant and cocktail bar in Hackney shares his cocktail recipes . Then kickstart your 2015 with a spicy Bloody Mary (or Virgin Mary if you’re feeling virtuous). ‘If you’re having dinner first, a lovely festive twist on the most classic of aperitifs, is the Negroni Sbagliato,’ Ruairi Giles, owner of The Bonneville French restaurant and cocktail bar in Hackney advises. ‘This version (recipe below) omits the gin, which you might want to save for later in the evening, and replaces it with Prosecco or Champagne. ‘Even if you’re not having dinner, this is a safe drink to kick the night off that won’t get you too inebriated early on in the evening. ‘To continue the evening, I’d stick to long drinks for now. Otherwise come midnight, you’ll be the one sleeping it off in the corner while your friends ring in the New Year.' And while a G&T  may not be the most adventurous of drinks, it will help you keep the pace. A clean, classic and cold drink like a Martini is the perfect way to end a New Year's Eve Party . Problems and solutions: Overindulged in the Clover Club (left)? Make things better with a Bloody Mary (right) ‘Sticking to the clear sprits will save you a world of pain the morning after. G&Ts or V&Ts are a safe bet. 'They may not be exciting but they’ll help you play the long game. Add some angostura bitters to jazz up a G&T.’ More complicated cocktails, he said, are best saved for the later part of the evening. ‘My go to cocktail is always the Clover Club (recipe below), simple, super tasty and very drinkable or for something with a fizz, The Twinkle (recipe below) is a punchy but tasty combination of vodka, elderflower and Prosecco or Champagne.’ At midnight, Mr Giles recommends opting for bubbly made only with Chardonnay grapes. ‘Come the stroke of midnight, Champagne is obligatory,’ he said. ‘What you drink will be based on your budget, but I find a decent blanc de blanc - Champagne made with only Chardonnay grapes - to be preferable on a long evening rather than the very dry brut Champagnes, which tend to dry out your mouth, giving you ""Champagne breath"", which is not a sexy as it sounds, and always lead to a killer hangover.’ And while the natural choice to end the night would be a good Scotch or an old fashioned, he advises steering clear of darker spirits. ‘It’s entirely up to you,’ he said, ‘but remember the darker spirits are the ones that hurt more the day after, and if the night is still young, these will send you off too early.’ ‘Go for a classic Martini (recipe below) if you're looking for something with a bit more kick. Clean, classic and cold.’ The Twinkle is a vodka cocktail topped with bubbly . Negroni Sbagliato . Ingredients: equal parts Campari, sweet vermouth and sparkling wine, ice, orange slice. Method: Mix all the ingredients and pour over ice in a rocks glass. Garnish with the orange slice. Not a fan of Campari? Switch it for Aperol, Campari’s less bitter cousin. Clover Club . Ingredients: 2oz gin, juice of half a lemon, one teaspoon sugar, egg white and quarter ounce raspberry syrup . Method: Pour the ingredients into a cocktail shaker with ice cubes.Shake vigorously (more than normal to properly mix the egg and sugar). Strain into a chilled cocktail glass . The Twinkle . Ingredients: 25ml vodka, 15ml elderflower cordial, Champagne to top. Method: Give the first two ingredients a short shake, then strain in to a chilled coupette or champagne flute.Top with Champagne and garnish with a lemon twist. Classic Martini . Ingredients: 2.5oz gin, 0.5oz dry vermouth, olives or a lemon twist for garnish, Angostura bitters (optional but recommended) Method: Pour the ingredients into a mixing glass filled with ice cubes.Stir for 30 seconds.

Method: Juice the lemon and put all the ingredients in a blender and blend. Add a litre of Worcestershire sauce, cover and leave in the fridge for at least 24hrs. When you want to use the mix, strain all the ingredients through a sieve. This will be enough to make up to 40 Bloody Mary's for you and your mates, and the mix will keep in the fridge for months.

"An elderly stroke patient was left lying in her own urine in a cold ward on Christmas Day, it was claimed today. Elsie Keirl, 84, was admitted to Musgrove Park Hospital - which has since launched an investigation - in Taunton, Somerset, a day after she had a stroke at her home in nearby Brigwater. Her son David Keirl, 58, stayed with her until Christmas morning before returning home for a few hours’ rest - but found on his return that his mother was ‘blue’ because her room was so cold. 'Left lying in her own urine': Elsie Keirl, 84, was admitted to hospital a day after she had a stroke at her home . Mr Keirl also claimed nurses failed to turn the pensioner for ten hours and left her lying in her own urine. The son said he was speaking out ‘because I don’t want this to happen to anyone else’. He said: ‘She spent her last Christmas in a freezing cold room with inadequate bedding, lying in her own urine. There must be thousands of old people without anyone to fight for them.’ Mrs Keirl was initially taken to hospital by ambulance at 9pm on Christmas Eve after falling ill at her home. Mr Keirl followed close behind and stayed with her until 6am on Christmas Day. He returned at 11am, just five hours later, when he found his mother - who also has another son - in a cold side room, with no heating and just one blanket. In hospital: Mrs Keirl (above) is claimed to have turned partially ‘blue’ while the rest of her had gone ‘white’ Despite his repeated requests, Mrs Keirl was not moved from the room and the air conditioning system remained on, further lowering the temperature. He claims that as a result, she had turned partially ‘blue’ and the rest of her had gone ‘white’. Mr Keirl said: ‘She was quite settled in the medical assessment unit and they said there was nothing I could do so I went home to get a few hours’ sleep. ‘I got back at 11.30am and when I walked into the side room of the ward where she was it was absolutely freezing cold, like an ice box. Her lips were blue and her ears were white. ‘There was an air vent I think, blowing out cold air. I asked for it to be turned off and was told it couldn’t be. The radiator was cold and I was told they were on a timer and would come on later. Probe: Musgrove Park Hospital in Taunton, Somerset, has launched an investigation following the incident . ‘There was one blanket on her, but her arms and legs and chest were sticking out and I kept asking for more blankets and kept explaining that at home she likes to be kept warm. ‘She should have been turned every two or three hours but at about 2pm to 3pm I thought, no one is turning her. When I felt in the bed it was really wet.’ After his complaints, Mrs Keirl was moved to a new room, where she is in a ‘fragile’ state. The hospital’s chief executive, Jo Cubbon, has now spoken to Mr Keirl and his family to apologise. Its deputy chief executive, Peter Lewis, added that if the claims were true then the allegations were very serious. A Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust spokesman said that she could not comment while an investigation was under way. This probe is due to be concluded in the next few days.","Elsie Keirl admitted to Musgrove Park Hospital  in Taunton, Somerset .

"A mother-of-two drank herself to death after downing 330 units of alcohol a week, including vodka for breakfast and five bottles of wine a day. Vicky White's family have just experienced the agony of their first Christmas without her, after she died in July. The 38-year-old succumbed to liver failure following a 25-year battle with her addiction. And for her partner Steve Hough, alcohol was a stark reminder of a missing face at the Christmas dinner table this year. Now her children, Jack, 17 and Mia, who celebrated her seventh birthday three days before her Ms White's death, must grow up missing their mother. Scroll down for video . Vicky White died of liver failure in July after battling an alcohol addiction for 25 years. She had appeared on the BBC show Panorama to highlight the dangers of excessive drinking . The mother-of-two, 38, from Liverpool managed to quit alcohol several times, but sadly relapsed . Mr Hough, 43, from Liverpool, said: 'Vicky didn't want to drink and she tried so hard to stop, but it just controlled her. She became a different person. 'She didn't have alcohol secretly stashed around the house - and there was no pattern to her drinking other than she would just hammer it for five or six hours at a time. 'She started drinking again two weeks before she died and she refused to take her medication. I knew from experience that trying to stop her would make her worse. 'Like every family with young children, we always loved Christmas. But this year, our first without her, was hard. 'All Mia wanted for Christmas was to have her mum back again.' He said he called an ambulance four days before his partner's death, when she became disorientated. By the time she was admitted to hospital, she could no longer recognise him, and was vomiting blood. 'I didn't want the children to see her, but Jack insisted on visiting,' he said. Shortly after her son's visit, Ms White slipped into a coma and later died from liver failure. Her children Mia, seven and 17-year-old Jack have just faced their first Christmas without their mother . Her partner, Steve Hough, said he hopes telling Ms White's story will help others receive treatment . Mr Hough said: 'My heart breaks for the kids. It took days for me to find the courage to tell Mia that her mummy is an angel in the sky and she was sobbing. 'I just want Vicky's story to be a lesson for others.' Ms White's partner Steve Hough said there was no pattern to her drinking other than she would just 'hammer it for five or six hours at a time'. 'She didn't have alcohol secretly stashed around the house and I couldn't say she always drank in the morning or evening,' he said. Ms White had been drinking heavily since she was a teenager and by 2011, she came close to death after downing vodka for breakfast followed by five bottles of wine every day – a staggering 330 units a week. 'She was so bloated that people kept asking when the baby was due,' Mr Hough said. 'Her eyes and skin were yellow and I was really worried about her.' Ms White, from Liverpool, began drinking cider at 13 with her friends in the local park and by the time she was 18 she was drinking every day. By her own admission, she came from a stable, loving home and had no problems, yet she found herself addicted to alcohol. At 18, she met a new boyfriend and at 20, gave birth to Jack, and stopped drinking during her pregnancy. But after Jack was born, she started turned again to alcohol. When he was nine months old – on her first night out since the birth – she had a glass of wine with friends. Soon, she found herself drinking each night. She progressed from cider to vodka and regularly drank during the day. Her son often missed school and before his Holy Communion ceremony his mother drank two bottles of cider, to the shock of her family. In August 2003, just before Jack's eighth birthday, Ms White's mother, Debbie, insisted he went to live with her. But the decision triggered another downward spiral in Ms White's life and, despite her determination to win him back, she just drank even more. Having given up alcohol before Mia's birth, Ms White relapsed shortly afterwards, drinking five bottles of wine each day, as well as vodka . In 2004, aged 28, she met her partner, Steve, then 33. Ms White told him about her drinking, but did not reveal how serious her problem was. 'I really had no idea she had a problem. I thought she was a social drinker, like me,' he recalled. The following year, Ms White's drinking escalated and she would down half a bottle of vodka for breakfast. Doctors warned of the damage her drinking was causing her liver and kidneys. The wake-up call worked, and Ms White stopped drinking for a time, and her son Jack returned home. In July 2007, she and Mr Hough had a daughter, Mia, who despite her mother's addiction was born perfectly healthy. But soon after Mia's arrival, Ms White found herself drawn in once again by her addiction, drinking five bottles of wine each day as well as vodka. 'She was so bloated that people kept asking when the baby was due,' Mr Hough said. 'Her eyes and skin were yellow and I was really worried about her.' In Spring 2011, she came close to death after downing vodka for breakfast followed by five bottles of wine every day – a staggering 330 units a week. She was rushed to hospital and diagnosed with liver failure and acute kidney failure. Doctors drained 42 litres of fluid from her organs, leaving her five stone lighter. Mr Hough: 'Vicky so bloated that it took 22 firemen and paramedics to get her down the stairs. 'They had to dismantle the banisters and take the back door off. It was humiliating for her.' Mr Hough said: 'She was our whole world. I know she tried so hard to stop drinking and I can't feel angry or resentful towards her. I just feel a terrible sadness' Alcohol causes and contributes to a wide range of serious health problems, accidents and deaths. The charity Alcohol Concern warns that: . • Alcohol accounts for 80 per cent of deaths from liver disease . • It is the second biggest risk factor for cancer after smoking . It also causes and contributes to numerous health problems including: . • Liver and kidney disease . • Cancers of the mouth and throat, liver, laryngeal, colon and breast cancer . • Pancreatitis . • Heart disease; high blood pressure; stroke . • Depression . • Foetal alcohol syndrome . In most cases, the relationship between alcohol and disease is 'dose-dependent' - that is the more alcohol consumed, the greater the risk of disease. Her plight was featured on Panorama to warn of the dangers of binge drinking. And she was given the stark warning that one more drink could kill her. This time, she finally took notice. After two months in hospital, she came home on a walking frame – but full of determination to change her life. Once again, she quit drinking. But she fell off the wagon again last year, despite doctors' warning that her body could not take much more strain. 'When she wasn't drinking, she became such a good mum,' Mr Hough said: 'She loved walking Mia to school. She wanted so much just to be normal and to care for her family.' Tragically, she was unable to meet the challenge and, after yet another relapse, sparked by a series of minor upsets, she found herself in hospital again in July. Four days later, she slipped into a coma and her liver failed, followed by her other major organs. Her family were by her bedside as her life support was withdrawn. Mr Hough said: 'I feel absolutely lost. I didn't know how to help Vicky when she was alive, and I certainly don't know how to carry on now she has gone. Alcohol increases the risk of a number of fatal diseases, particularly when consumed in high doses, as this table from the charity Alcohol Concern shows . 'She was our whole world. I know she tried so hard to stop drinking and I can't feel angry or resentful towards her. I just feel a terrible sadness. 'Mia cries all the time and asks for her mummy. I worry how she will cope with the news that Vicky drank herself to death, when she is older. 'Jack is withdrawn and angry. He doesn't drink at all. He's seen what damage it can do. 'Our first Christmas without her was very tough. 'I hadn't made any plans because I couldn't face the day without Vicky - and I had fallen out with her family following her death,' he told MailOnline. But to his surprise, on Christmas Eve, Vicky's parents, Chris and Debbie, and sister, Christina, arrived at his home and decorated the house. They also cooked a big Christmas lunch and celebrated together, before visiting Ms White's grave in the evening. Mr Hough said: 'All I tried to do was give the kids the best Christmas I could. 'I know Vicky will be looking down on them, wherever she is - their own guardian angel.'

"The year in which a person is born may predict whether they will become obese, a new study has found. Doctors discovered year of birth affects the activity of a gene that could raise the odds of obesity. People who show a mutation of a gene called FTO – dubbed the 'obesity gene' - are more likely to become overweight if they were born after 1942, scientists found. Various studies have linked versions of the FTO gene to chronic obesit. In May a U.S. study found the gene is thought to trigger hunger pangs and affect a person's ability to resist impulse eating. Doctors discovered year of birth affects the activity of a gene that could raise the odds of obesity. Versions of the FTO gene have been linked to chronic obesity, as it is thought to trigger hunger . Another study found people with this gene may also be more likely to eat high calorie or fatty foods as they age. Now, it seems year of birth could affect the gene, meaning a child born 20 years after their parents, and who looks the same, could have a higher BMI. Changes in culture, such as a greater reliance on technology and the availability of food may be boosting obesity by 'activating' the obesity gene, researchers theorised. Wanting to investigate the impact of genes versus environment on traits such as obesity, researchers looked at the risk of obesity across generations. They sought to find out whether different conditions experienced by different age groups might alter the expression of the variation of the FTO gene linked with obesity. They used data from the Framingham Heart Study, which involved sequencing the DNA of more than 10,000 parents, children and grandchildren. They also used data from participants in the Framingham Offspring Study, which followed children of participants in the original study. This meant the team could determine which families carried the version of the FTO gene which is linked to obesity. The participants ranged in age between 27 to 63 when the data was gathered in 1971. The researchers found no link between the FTO gene and obesity for people born before 1942. However, they found a link between the gene and obesity in those born after 1942, and the link was twice as strong as previously reported. Researchers found no link between the FTO gene and obesity for people born before 1942.However, they found a link between the gene and obesity in those born after 1942, and the link was twice as strong as previously reported . The study was not able to identify differences that combined with the version of the FTO gene to increase the risk of obesity. But the authors suggested that post World War II factors such as an increased reliance on technology rather than manual labour and the availability of high-calorie processed food were contributing factors. Lead author Dr James Niels Rosenquist, a psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, U.S., said: 'We know that environment plays a huge role in the expression of genes, and the fact that our effect can be seen even among siblings born during different years implies that global environmental factors such as trends in food products and workplace activity, not just those found within families, may impact genetic traits.' Genetic studies should be interpreted 'with a grain of salt', he said. New risks may present themselves in future as we see different genes being expressed in response to our changing environment, he added.","Versions of the FTO gene have been linked to obesity as it triggers hunger .

"The tip about the third most powerful House Republican giving a speech at a white supremacist meeting came from the family of a prominent Democrat in his home state - who once ran against him and lost. Rep Steve Scalise’s political career has been thrown into turmoil after Robert Reed, the son of Louisiana liberal Gilda Reed, told a political blogger about Mr Scalise’s appearance at the 2002 event. Miss Reed took on Mr Scalise in the 2008 Congressional race and has been Tweeting numerous articles about the row since it became public earlier this week. In an interview she and her son admitted they had sat on the information for six years and only made it public when Mr Scalise was about to be re-elected as House Majority Whip. Scroll down for video . STAYING: Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise spoke at an international convention of white supremacists in 2002 while serving as a member of his state's legislature, but House Speaker is letting him stay in leadership . Tipster: Failed candidate Gilda Reed's son Robert  spilled the beans about Scalise's speech to a white supremicist group to a liberal political blogger . The disclosure strongly suggests that Miss Reed was waiting for the best moment to try toruin Mr Scalise’s political career, but Mr Reed said that he just wanted ‘justice to be done’. He told Talking Points Memo: ‘I don't like liars. I don't like people who misrepresent themselves or people who pander to neo-Nazi groups. ‘I could have let the nation know (in 2008) and I didn't.' So far Mr Scalise has the support of the GOP establishment after apologizing for appearing at the 2002 convention of the European-American Unity and Rights Organization (EURO). The organization has been described as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Centre and was founded by former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. Miss Reed, a mother-of-seven, is a psychology professor at the University of New Orleans and has been active in politics in Louisiana for decades. Her son was her campaign manager when she took on Mr Scalise when he ran for Congress in 2008 in a special election when Bobby Jindal, the Republican, left his seat and ran for governor, but lost heavily. They told Talking Points Memo that at the time they were approached by a credible source who told them about Mr Scalise’s attendance at the EURO meeting, which took place at a Best Western hotel just outside New Orleans. Mr Reed said he ‘desperately wanted to use it’ but they decided not to - until last week when they told Lamar White, Jr, a liberal political blogger based in New Orleans. MY MAN: House Speaker John Boehner (right) held a press conference in June to announce the election of Scalise (left) as the House Majority Whip – and he is standing by him as the racially-steeped controversy boils . The Reeds also claimed that their source had more information but they have refused to be identified for fear of reprisals. The disclosure that Miss Reed was involved in the story has led to accusations she has engaged in murky party politics. A commenter on a Louisiana political website wrote: ‘One of the talk radio stations was reporting she was reportedly upset with Rep Scalise because she thinks he can save UNO's psychology department from being cut in the next round of Louisiana State budget cuts because UNO is working on eliminating her position. So she purportedly pulled out the hit piece.’ The reaction to the row in Washington has been mixed: House Speaker John Boehner has said Mr Scalise has his ‘full confidence’ and other senior GOP leaders have given him their backing. However prominent conservative commentator Erick Erickson Tweeted: ‘How Do You Show Up at a David Duke Event and Not Know What It Is?’ John Weaver, a GOP consultant who has advised Senator John McCain, told the Washington Post that Mr Scalise ‘cannot serve in leadership in our party as we’re in the process of trying to show the American people we can handle the burden of governing, especially in a country so divided across all demographic lines’. RACIAL ALLIANCE? David Duke (left), then grand wizard of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in Louisiana, participated in a cross-burning in May 1977 near New Orleans; an organization he later ran invited then-state legislator Steve Scalise to speak at a meeting, and Scalise has apoloigized for doing so . Scalise has said that he did not know who EURO was when he gave his speech and that he condemns their views. However this has been undermined by conflicting accounts from Mr Duke and Kenny Knight, Mr Duke’s former campaign adviser. Mr Duke has said that ‘Kenny would keep Scalise up to date on my issues’ and that Mr Scalise ‘recognised how popular I was in his own district’. Mr Knight has said that Mr Scalise ‘knew who I was’ but claimed that the politician’s speech took place before the EURO event and just happened to be in the same venue. Mr Scalise’s denials have been rubbished by the Southern Poverty Law Centre which has called on him to resign. In a post on organization’s website Mark Potok wrote: ‘Scalise’s claim of ignorance is almost impossible to believe. ‘He was a state representative and an aspiring national politician at the time, and EURO already was well known as a hate group led by America’s most famous white supremacist.’ Mr Potok said that the day before Mr Scalise spoke, a minor league baseball team cancelled its stay at the hotel where the event took place after hearing that EURO was meeting there. Roll Call’s Niels Lesnewski also discovered an interview from 1999 in which Mr Scalise said he knew who Mr Duke was and appeared to back some of his policies.","Louisiana Rep.

"This skin-tight bodycon dress was so tight that it saved 21-year-old Zoe Turner's life by stopping her bones piercing her internal organs . A graduate survived a horrific taxi crash with a cement mixer because a skin-tight red dress stopped her bones from piercing her internal organs. University graduate Zoe Turner, 21, from Wakefield, bought the £34.99 bodycon dress from website Missguided and wore it to a Christmas party. But, on her way home, a cement mixer crashed into Miss Turner's taxi, leaving her and three friends with life-threatening injuries. Doctors told Miss Turner that her snug dress had acted like an old-fashioned corset and had stopped her bones popping out and perforating vital organs. The medics said she could have suffered fatal internal injuries if she had not been wearing such a tight garment. Miss Turner said: 'I couldn't believe my dress saved my life. That's the best £35 I've ever spent. 'Although I didn't come off lightly, the end result could have been a lot worse. 'The doctors told me that if I hadn't worn such a tight dress which held in place my bones as the car impacted, I would have most definitely punctured vital organs as my bones went out of place.' Miss Turner, a psychology and criminology graduate from Nottingham Trent University, had put on the figure-hugging dress to attend her mother's work do at Leeds United's Elland Road football ground. Her mother Sharon, 44, works as a customer service worker. But the drama unfolded when Miss Turner got into a taxi with a group of friends for the 35-minute journey home. Just after the taxi had pulled off, a cement truck careered into the driver's side of the vehicle. Miss Turner, who lives at her family home, was in the passenger's seat wearing a seatbelt. But her three friends in the back were not strapped in and were knocked unconscious due to the impact. The driver's head went through the front window. She said: 'I was in unimaginable pain. My body was aching and I just remember thinking - I have to get my belt off. 'The pain and restriction my dress was causing was unbearable and I stumbled out of the car. 'I thought everyone else was dead. I was in so much shock I didn't realise how serious my injuries were.' Firefighters arrived within five minutes and cut open the vehicle to free the passengers. The psychology and criminology graduate, from Wakefield, was hospitalised after a cement mixer crashed into the taxi in which she and three friends were travelling . The crash left Miss Turner, pictured left with her mother Sharon and right while in Leeds General Infirmary, with life-threatening injuries, including a fractured pelvis, fractured vertebra and broke sternum . Miss Turner was rushed to Leeds General Infirmary where she was sent for a C.T. scan and given a brace to hold her pelvis together, along with morphine. She had multiple injuries including a fractured pelvis, fractured vertebra and broke sternum. She said: 'I laid in the hospital bed unable to move my legs. I was so scared, I didn't know if I'd be able to walk again. I just wanted my parents there - the pain was piercing.' The driver of the taxi suffered a broken neck, while her friends survived with broken arms, eye sockets and pelvis. Miss Turner (left), pictured with her mother Sharon, 44 (middle) and her sister Jessica Turner (right) Miss Turner bought the dress from Missguided (pictured) and said it was 'the best £35 she had ever spent' After five days in hospital, Miss Turner was released to go home, just in time for Christmas. She had been due to start a new job at a care home but has had to put it on hold. She added: 'My mum took me home in her car. My wounds were starting to heal and I was able to walk a lot more than I had been able too. 'But getting in the car was the hardest thing. When my mum put on the brakes I literally broke down crying. 'I am lucky to be alive, the thought of not having worn that dress makes me shudder. 'That £35 was honestly the best I've ever spent. I'll never forget that red dress - It's just a shame it didn't survive too!'","Zoe Turner, from Wakefield, wore a dress from Missguided for festive bash .

"International experts have conceded they missed early chances to control the spread of Ebola as they incorrectly believed an initial lull in deaths meant the outbreak was over. The World Health Organisation (WHO) concluded that 'modest further intervention efforts' could have controlled the outbreak in the spring. They conceded that infighting and finger pointing led to delays in the international response, according to a New York Times investigation. Allowing the less experienced African branch of the WHO to co-ordinate efforts on the ground and failing to understand how West African attitudes towards issues such as burial might affect the disease's spread also allowed the outbreak to escalate. Scroll down for video . International experts have conceded they missed early chances to control the spread of the deadly Ebola virus. 'Modest further intervention efforts' could have controlled the outbreak in the spring, World Health Organization (WHO) experts said. Pictured are health workers taking a victim to a clinic in Monrovia, Liberia . Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said African experts wanted to prove they could tackle the disease on their own. 'People shouldn't die because someone's embarrassed that they can't do it themselves,' he said . Experts incorrectly believed the outbreak was 'over' in April as cases of the disease had slowed. In fact, it had gone underground and would go on to kill 7,800 people by December 2014. Pictured are health workers carrying  the body of a suspected Ebola victim for burial at a cemetery in Freetown, Sierra Leone . Dr Pierre Rollin, an Ebola specialist at the  Centers for Disease Control (CDC), U.S., who spent nearly two months in Guinea during the early days of the outbreak, said the lack of new cases prompted aid organisations to withdraw and declare the outbreak over. 'This is close to over,' the New York Times reported he said to himself on the plane ride home in April. 'That's it for this outbreak.' In fact, 20,000 people would go on to contract Ebola and 7,800 have now died. Dr Rollin said health officials underestimated how much West African practices, especially regarding burial practices, would catalyse the spread of the disease. 'It was an unprecedented outbreak,' he said. 'There were a lot of things we didn't know at that time.' The first patient died of Ebola in Guinea on December 28 last year, but the virus was not officially recognised until three months later. The WHO and the Guinean health ministry documented cases of a handful of people dying or being sick with Ebola-like symptoms in Sierra Leone in March, but the information didn't reach the team investigating suspected cases. The most likely cause of the deadly outbreak of Ebola in West Africa was a young boy playing near a colony of virus-infected bats, scientists claim. The two-year-old boy - described as the index case, or patient zero - became infected and was the first to die in his village in Meliandou, Guinea in December last year. It is thought 'patient zero' was was Emile Ouamouno, described as a playful toddler by his father Etienne. Before his death, on December 6, 2013, Emile had been near a tree harbouring the free-tailed bats. Researchers from the Robert Koch-Institute in Berlin concluded the large colony of free-tailed insectivorous bats were the most likely source of the disease. Villagers reported that children often used to play in and around thehollow tree, and may have resulted in a massive exposure to the bats. The toddler came down with a sky-high fever, began vomiting and passing black stools. It took four days for the disease to claim Emile's life, and he passed away on December 6, 2013. His sister Philomene fell ill on Christmas Day last year, and was dead before New Year. Their mother followed, along with their grandmother, Etienne said earlier this year. The disease then spread to other members of the community before spreading to other parts of Guinea. It was not until May that Sierra Leone recorded its first confirmed cases, prompting infighting and finger pointing among the WHO, Guinea and Sierra Leone. Thomas Frieden, director of the CDC, said efforts to help were resisted because African experts wanted to prove they could tackle the disease on their own. Usually in such situations the CDC would be  brought into outbreaks quickly and given a primary role, and Dr Frieden was surprised this hadn't happened. He learned that CDC experts were being held up by bureaucratic demands, and were having their credentials checked by the African WHO officials. 'People shouldn't die because someone's embarrassed that they can't do it themselves,' he said. Aid and experts were sent from the Geneva branch of the WHO, but leadership of the early response was largely delegated to regional WHO representatives on the ground. Worried, Dr Nils Daulaire, who until February sat on the WHO executive board, said the African office was seen as a place where 'politics trumps substance' and where senior officials are 'often not the cream of the crop'. A Guinean WHO official who had never been involved in fighting Ebola was put in charge of co-ordinating the response on the ground, ahead of Dr Pierre Formenty, the WHO's top Ebola authority. Dr Formenty said this was obviously 'only because I was coming from Geneva'. The WHO's budget for epidemic preparedness and response in Africa had also been more than halved over five years from $26 million (£17 million) in 2010-11 to $11 million (£7 million) for 2014-15, meaning its capacity had shrunk. By April, when officials were hailing the end of the outbreak, it had simply gone 'underground', with cases going unreported. Governments attempted to broadcast the message that Ebola was spread through contact with fluids like vomit, faeces and blood, and that bodies were still highly contagious after death. But communities continued to wash bodies after a burial, as this was believed to lead to contentment in the afterlife. Villagers complained their relatives taken by health workers to treatment centres never returned and protests outside one Medecin Sans Frontiers (MSF) clinic forced its closure. It wasn't until August – nine months after the first case recoded in Guinea – that the WHO declared Ebola was a 'public health emergency of international concern' – a rating which mobilised an international response. Writing in the New England Journal of Medicine, Peter Piot, who helped discover Ebola, and Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust concluded the outbreak 'an avoidable crisis'.

"A mother who was accidentally shot dead by her 2-year-old son in a Walmart supermarket had been carrying the gun in a handbag given to her as a Christmas present, it emerged yesterday. Veronica Rutledge had a concealed weapons permit for the gun which the toddler, her only child, fired into her at point blank range after finding it in her handbag. They described the nuclear research scientist, 29, as a ‘beautiful, young, loving mother’ who was ‘taken much too soon’ in the latest gun tragedy in the U.S. where there are more than 32,000 firearm-related deaths a year. Scroll down for video . Tragic accident: A two-year-old boy accidentally killed his a 29-year-old mother Veronica Rutledge (left) at an Idaho Walmart store after reaching into her bag and firing her hidden gun . Ruteledge had a bag similar to the one pictured here, specially designed to conceal a weapon (file image of a bag that is not believed to be the model given to Ruteledge, on the left). It was revealed today that the bag was a gift from her husband Colt (on the right, a picture of her husband from his MySpace profile) Mrs Rutledge was killed at the Walmart in Hayden, Idaho, on Tuesday in front of three of her nieces - all aged under 11 - who had joined her to spend their holiday gift cards. In-store CCTV captured the shocking moment in the electronics aisle as the boy, who was sitting in the trolley seat, reached into his mother’s handbag where he found the gun and pulled the trigger. The mother-of-one from Blackfoot, Idaho was visiting family with her husband Colt, who she married in 2009, and was spending the day with her son and nieces, according to the Spokesman-Review newspaper in Idaho. Unthinkable: People stand inside the Walmart in Hayden, Idaho on Tuesday after the two-year-old boy tragically killed his own mother while they shopped. The Walmart was evacuated and closed after the shooting . Location: The shooting happened in a Walmart store in Hayden, Idaho . Mrs Rutledge was a strong advocate of the Second Amendment which guarantees the right to bear arms. She worked at the Idaho National Laboratory in Idaho Falls and a family member said that she was a ‘chemical engineer, a very bright young lady’. Her husband had given his wife the handbag containing a special zipped compartment for the gun as a Christmas present. The victim’s father-in law Terry Rutledge criticized those who blamed the dead mother as being irresponsible for carrying a loaded weapon. He said: ‘They are painting Veronica as irresponsible, and that is not the case. ‘I brought my son up around guns, and he has extensive experience shooting it. And Veronica had had handgun classes. They’re both licensed to carry, and this wasn’t just some purse she had thrown her gun into. ‘Odd as it may sound, we are gun people.’ He went on to say that the tragic incident will haunt his family for the rest of their lives. 'My son is terrible,' Terry Rutledge told the Washington Post. 'He has a 2-year-old boy right now who doesn’t know where his mom is and he’ll have to explain why his mom isn’t coming home. And then, later on his life, as he questions it more, he’ll again have to explain what happened, so we’ll have to relive this several times over.' Idaho, a rugged and largely rural state, is among the U.S. states with the highest percentage of Americans who own guns. State law allows concealed weapons in most public places and only last week Hayden amended its own rules to make clear a gun owner is justified in firing a weapon in self defense. Lt Stu Miller of the Kootenai County sheriff’s office described the shooting as a ‘tragic accident’. Asked why Mrs Rutledge was carrying a loaded gun he said that it was ‘pretty common around here’ for someone to do so. Shooting: An Idaho state patrol officer arrived at the store in Hayden on Tuesday following the shooting . Lt Miller added that even now her son ‘probably still doesn’t even know what has happened’. Hayden resident Judy Minter said: ‘There’s a lot of people who do carry guns in this area. ‘But for her to have it within reach of her child - that was not very smart.’ Idaho National Laboratory senior chemical engineer Vince Maio worked with Mrs Rutledge on a research paper about using glass ceramic to store nuclear waste, according to the Spokesman-Review. 'Beautiful person': Ms  Rutledge (left) was a nuclear research scientist and a mother-of-one . Tragic: The victim was spending the day with her son and nieces when she was shot dead . ‘She had a lot of maturity for her age,’ he told the newspaper. ‘Her work was impeccable. She found new ways to do things that we did before and she found ways to do them better.’ ‘She was a beautiful person,’ he added. The incident is the latest example of shootings involving children in the U.S. Only last month a girl of four seriously injured a boy of three who lived next door when she shot him in the face. Walmart spokesman Aaron Mullins said that bringing a loaded gun into the store was not a violation of store policy as the company defers to state and local laws.","Veronica Rutledge, 29, was shopping with her only son, 2, and nieces at Walmart on Tuesday when she was killed .

"The last four inmates on death row in Maryland will live out their final days behind bars, the state's governor ruled Wednesday. Outgoing Democratic leader Martin O'Malley says executing the men 'does not serve the public good of the people' and their sentences have been changed to life in prison without parole. Heath William Burch, Vernon Lee Evans, Jr., Anthony Grandison, Sr. and Jody Lee Miles - who have collectively served more than 80 years behind bars - are expected to remain at the North Branch Correctional Institution, a supermax facility located near Cumberland. News of the repeal comes more than one year after O'Malley scrapped the death penalty in Maryland, making it the 18th U.S. state to do so. The last four inmates on death row in Maryland will live out their final days in prison, the state's governor ruled Wednesday (left, Jody Lee Miles and right, Heath William Burch) News of their changed penalties comes more than one year after outgoing Democratic leader Martin O'Malley scrapped the death penalty in Maryland (left, Vernon Lee Evans, Jr. and right, Anthony Grandison, Sr.) The governor's office argued the sanction does not deter crime, cannot be administered without racial bias and costs three times more than maintaining a prisoner for life. Policy makers also highlighted that a mistake cannot be reversed if an innocent person is put to death by lethal injection, electrocution, firing squad, hanging, or gas chamber. O'Malley ruled that capital punishment in Maryland would be replaced with a sentence of life without parole. Since this change came into play, there have been ongoing arguments over what to do with the remaining death row inmates. O'Malley noted in a statement Wednesday that outgoing Democratic attorney general Doug Gansler recently asserted that carrying out prior sentences would be illegal in the absence of an existing statute. 'The question at hand is whether any public good is served by allowing these essentially un-executable sentences to stand,' O'Malley said. The governor's office argued the punishment does not deter crime, cannot be administered without racial bias and costs a considerable amount . 'In my judgment, leaving these death sentences in place does not serve the public good of the people of Maryland - present or future.' The governor said he had met or spoken with many of the relatives of the people killed by the inmates, and he thanked them for talking with him about the cases. But he said that his failing to act at this point in the legal process would 'needlessly and callously subject survivors, and the people of Maryland, to the ordeal of an endless appeals process, with unpredictable twists and turns, and without any hope of finality or closure.' Vernon Lee Evans, Jr. was sentenced to death together with drug kingpin Anthony Grandison Sr. in 1984 for the 1983 murders of David Scott Piechowicz and his sister-in-law, Susan Kennedy. Heath William Burch received the same penalty in 1996 for the double murder of seniors Robert and Cleo Davis. And lastly, Jody Lee Miles was convicted two years later for the robbery and murder of Edward Joseph Atkinson. The four men have submitted various pleas over the years in a bid to get their sentences altered. The latest ruling will no doubt divide opinion, however many have have congratulated O'Malley's 'progressive stance' on the matter.","Heath William Burch, Vernon Lee Evans, Jr., Anthony Grandison, Sr. and Jody Lee Miles have had their sentences changed to life in prison without parole .
Outgoing Democratic leader Martin O'Malley says executing the men 'does not serve the public good of the people'
It is expected that the death row inmates will remain at the North Branch Correctional Institution, a supermax facility located near Cumberland .
News of their changed penalties comes more than one year after O'Malley scrapped the death penalty in Maryland ."
"Scientists are a step closer to developing a pill to cure dementia. A team in Belgium were able to repair diseased brain cells taken from patients with a common form of the condition, for which there is no cure. They identified a gene variant that prevents neurons from forming properly, and managed to correct it through genetic engineering. The researchers found they could also correct alter the gene a compound that inhibited a chemical responsible for the gene mutation. They have hailed the discovery a breakthrough, believing it could pave the way for a new 'dementia pill'. Scientists were able to repair diseased brain cells taken from patients with a common form of dementia, and say drugs could be developed to treat the condition . The study used stem cells from three patients with a type of dementia called 'frontotemporal dementia', which accounts for about half of cases diagnosed in patients before the age of 60. There is currently no cure for this type of the condition, which runs in families. Frontotemporal disorders are the result of damage to neurons in parts of the brain called the frontal and temporal lobes, gradually leading to behavioural symptoms or language and emotional problems. Mutations in a gene called GRN (progranulin) are believed to be behind frontotemporal dementia, but versions of the condition in mice do not mimic all the features of the human type. So the Belgian researchers recreated dementia in a laboratory dish using human iPSCs (induced pluripotent stem cells) to help identify a potential new treatment strategy. Molecular biologist Professor Catherine Verfaillie, of the Catholic University of Leuven, said: 'Use of induced pluripotent stem cell technology makes it possible to model dementias that affect people later in life.' The technique involves taking skin cells from patients and reprogramming them into embryonic like stem cells capable of turning into other specific cell types relevant for studying a particular disease. 1 Regular exercise . Doing exercise three to five times a week for between 30 minutes and an hour is recommended. In the UK, adults are urged to do 150 minutes of activity a week to promote health but barely a third manage it. 2 Give up smoking . Never smoking is recommended, but smokers who give up by the age of 40 can gain ten years of extra life, claim scientists. 3 Reach a healthy body weight . A healthy weight is a ‘healthy’ body mass index (BMI) score. BMI is assessed by comparing height to weight, in a calculation which divides weight in kilos by height in metres squared. A healthy score is between 18.5 and 24.99 - above is overweight and obese. 4 Eat a Mediterranean diet . The Mediterranean diet is high in fish, nuts, whole grains and ‘healthy’ fats such as those in olive oil, while low in red meat and dairy products. Studies suggest three to five or more portions of fruit and vegetables with fat making up less than 30 per cent of calories. 5 Keep alcohol consumption low . Low or moderate alcohol consumption is classified as three or fewer units per day for men, two or fewer for women, with abstinence not treated as a healthy behaviour. A small 125ml glass of wine contains 1.3 units, while a pint of beer contains at least two units. Professor Verfaillie added the research could pave the way for a pill to treat frontotemporal dementia to be developed. She said: 'iPSC models can now be used to better understand dementia, and in particular frontotemporal dementia, and might lead to the development of drugs that can curtail or slow down the degeneration of cortical neurons.' The patients in the study all carried a GRN mutation which prevented their immature iPSCs from turning into mature, specialised cells called cortical neurons, the cell type most affected in frontotemporal dementia. One of the top defective pathways in the iPSCs was a signalling pathway known as Wnt, which plays an important role in the development of neurons. But genetic correction or treatment with a compound restored the ability of the iPSCs to turn into cortical neurons. Taken together, the findings demonstrate the GRN mutation causes the defect in cortical neuron formation by altering the Wnt signalling pathway. Researcher Dr Philip Van Damme, of the Leuven Research Institute for Neuroscience and Disease, added: 'Our findings suggest signalling events required for neurodevelopment may also play major roles in neurodegeneration. 'Targeting such pathways, as for instance the Wnt pathway presented in this study, may result in the creation of novel therapeutic approaches for frontotemporal dementia.' The researchers will now work to better understand what goes wrong in GRN mutated cells, as well as identify precise molecular targets that could then be used for drug screens. The study was published in the journal Stem Cell Reports. It comes after a major research project published this month found simple lifestyle changes could see 80,000 people saved from dementia every year. The study suggests that people make changes earlier in life to cut the risk of developing the brain disease as they grow old. It said three million cases of dementia could be avoided in Britain by 2040 if people started regularly exercising their bodies and minds. Frontotemporal dementia is the result of damage to neurons in parts of the brain called the frontal (pictured in blue) and temporal (pictured in purple) lobes. There is no currently no cure and it runs in families .","Scientists were able to repair bran cells taken from patients with dementia .

"A teenager's weight plummeted to four stone after embarking on the 'Special K' diet resulted in her developing a vicious eating disorder. Rebekah Clegg, now 22, credits her recovery, and survival from anorexia's grasp to the birth of her daughter Lola, earlier this year. At the age of 14 Mrs Clegg, weighing 7st 7lb, decided to embark on the cereal-based diet, while taking up running at the same time. Initially her weight dropped by 4lbs, but after enjoying the compliments from friends, Mrs Clegg 'became obsessed' making drastic cuts to her diet. Within four years her weight had plummeted to just 4st, and she appeared so thin each bone on her ribcage was painfully visible. Scroll down for video . Rebekah Clegg, now 22 and weighing a healthy 8st, right, started the Special K diet when she was just 14 years old. After 'becoming obsessed' and taking the diet to an extreme her weight plummeted to just four stone within four years, left . She was rushed to an eating disorder clinic after consuming just 200 calories a day. Seemingly in the clutches of the eating disorder, it was Mrs Clegg's desire to become a mother that saved her. Warned months of failing to eat properly depriving her body of vital nutrients, could leave her infertile, Mrs Clegg was drawn out of the anorexia black hole consuming her. The mother-of-one, who now weighs a healthy 8st, said she now enjoys a healthy, balanced diet. 'Four years ago, I never dreamed I'd be a mum and that I wouldn't care about what I weighed,' she said. 'My priority now is being a good mother to my little girl, and that means being as healthy as I can.' Mrs Clegg, from Southport, Merseyside, said she decided to try out the Special K diet when she heard about it from her school friends, despite being a slim 14-year-old, weighing 7st 7lb at 5ft 5in. But while friends soon resorted to their old eating habits, Mrs Clegg's obsession grew into the dangerous eating disorder. Within six months she started to make even more drastic cuts to her diet and began to exercise regularly. She said: 'I have never been a chubby child and have always been a normal weight until I was in Year 9. ‘It started off as a silly new diet to try but I became obsessed, I convinced myself that I needed to get thinner. Now 22, the mother-of-one credits the birth of her daughter Lola, this year, with saving her from the vicious eating disorder . Mrs Clegg, who is pictured while she was in hospital in 2012, embarked on the diet when she was 14 years old. Just before Christmas 2009, when Rebekah's mother Sue, 46, forced her to go to their local GP after her periods had stopped and her clothes were hanging off her skeletal frame . Mrs Clegg weighed 7st 7lbs and was 5ft 5in when she began to develop the eating disorder, aged 14 . 'I was just a normal teen thinking I wanted to lose weight and was very naïve about it all really, eventually my eating spiralled out of control. 'Every spare chance I got, I spent looking up new exercises and healthy eating tips. And I even enrolled in running classes at school. 'I didn't consider the damage I was doing to my body and how it could affect me having children in the future. 'I felt light-headed all the time and couldn't concentrate on anything when I started college in 2009, I would feel dizzy just from walking a few steps but would still force myself to do my exercises in the mornings.' It was just before Christmas 2009, when Mrs Clegg's mother Sue, 46, forced her to go to their local GP after her periods had stopped and her clothes were hanging off her skeletal frame. The 17-year-old weighed in at 5st and the doctor urged her to start eating properly. But her weight continued to drop and, a month later, she weighed just 4st 10lb. Her doctor referred her to the Priory clinic in Bury. For a month, she was banned from exercising and nurses would sit her down to eat three meals a day. She said: 'After each meal we were made to sit in the living room for half an hour, so that nurses could monitor that we weren't secretly exercising. Mrs Clegg, from Merseyside, was worried her weight could render her infertile, prompting her to face her anorexia. Her daughter Lola, right, was born on February 21, 2014 . 'Even when I took a shower and went to the bathroom I had to have a nurse with me to supervise. 'I watched horrified as terribly thin girls tried to hide their food in their pockets and ran off to the toilets to make themselves sick, but the staff would always catch them. 'It sometime took the girls over an hour just to eat one meal. 'I knew if I didn't get better, I would die here in the clinic.' She attended group therapy and was discharged in July weighing just over 6st but, within two weeks, she began to get anxious when her mother would force her to eat. Threatened with being readmitted if she didn't eat properly, Mrs Clegg gradually began eating her old favourite foods again. As she started to feel better, she got a job as a credit controller and began to enjoy her freedom. She continued to exercise at the gym but followed a healthy exercise plan this time. Just weeks into her recovery, she met RAF firefighter Daniel Clegg, 22, in the gym. The couple started dating and three years later Daniel proposed. Desperate for a family, Mrs Clegg was worried that many years of starving her body might have left her infertile. When she became pregnant in May 2013, she was overjoyed, and vowed to eat healthily and stop exercising for the sake of her baby. She said: 'I was ecstatic and so was Daniel but suddenly the reality of eating for two hit me. ‘Briefly, I panicked at the thought of getting bigger and having to eat more but I knew for the sake of our little one I would have finally put it all behind me. Just weeks into her recovery, she met RAF firefighter Daniel Clegg, 22, in the gym. The couple started dating and three years later Daniel proposed. They married in August, following the birth of their daughter . Mrs Clegg said: 'It has been five years since anorexia gripped my life and now I am now a healthy 8st 1lb. My focus now is my daughter and all I want is for her to grow up, happy and healthy and with her mum the same' 'I decided to eat whenever I was hungry and found myself putting double portions on my plate to make sure my baby was getting all the right nutrients. 'My weight slowly crept up to 8st for the first time in years I didn't care.' Her daughter Lola was born on February 21, 2014 and the happy couple went on to get married on August 9, 2014. Mrs Clegg added: 'It has been five years since anorexia gripped my life and now I am now a healthy 8st 1lb. ‘My focus now is my daughter and all I want is for her to grow up, happy and healthy and with her mum the same.' A spokeswoman from Kellogs, who manufacture Special K cereal, said they could not comment on individual cases. She added: ‘The Special K two week plan, which no longer exists, was created by nutritionists for over 18 year olds that have a BMI of over 25. ‘The plan was designed to be followed for two weeks only.’","Rebekah Clegg, 22, took up the Special K diet at age 14 despite being slim .

"Two suspects with illustrious names have fallen foul of the law in Philadelphia, according to police. Ulysses Grant, 28, and Theodore Roosevelt Gaines, 49, who share their names with the 18th and  26th presidents of the United States respectively, were busted this month on separate drugs and theft charges. Grant was charged with possession with intent to deliver narcotics following his arrest on December 10. Ulysses Grant, 28, who said he was named after his great-grandfather, President Ulysses Grant (right), was arrested in Philadelphia earlier this month on a drugs charge . The 28-year-old told ABC News he was not guilty but admitted that he was carrying a knife and stun gun. He was not charged for this alleged crime. The suspect, who said he was named because President Grant was his great-grandfather, was planning to fight the drug charges following a court appearance this week. He claimed that Philadelphia cops brought him to a home which had 'crack inside and forced him to sign a paper', ABC reported. In a separate incident on Sunday, Theodore Roosevelt Gaines, 49, was caught stealing from a grocery store, according to Philadelphia Daily News reporter Dana DiFilippo. The suspect, from Roslyn, Pennsylvania, allegedly left the store with goods worth close to $120. Police refused to release a photograph of Gaines. The Philadelphia Police Department said in a statement to Daily Mail Online on Wednesday that they could not verify if the names are the males’ birth names, adding 'these are the names they provided at the time of their arrest(s)'.

"A jewellery designer beloved of the Duchess of Cambridge is to be honoured with an MBE for her services to fashion. Nikki Gewirtz, 44, the founder of Lola Rose, will join an exclusive club of designers recognised for their work, among them Anya Hindmarch, Betty Jackson and Alice Temperley. Speaking to MailOnline, Gewirtz says she was 'absolutely delighted and humbled' to spot her name on the New Year's Honours list, which also included actresses Joan Collins and Sheridan Smith. Delighted: Nikki Gewirtz, the 44-year-old founder of Lola Rose, says she is delighted about the honour . Talent: Ms Gewirtz hopes the award will encourage budding designers to follow their dreams . 'I am absolutely delighted and humbled,' said the delighted designer. 'The fashion industry has been incredibly supportive and to be joining the ranks of such eminent talent is  an honour.' Her jewellery business was set up 14 years ago when Gewirtz, then personal assistant to a radio boss, was given a bracelet and thought: 'I could have made this myself!' One visit to a Covent Garden bead shop later and Lola Rose was born. Originally based in the London-born designer's bedroom, the first piece to make an impact on the fashion world were 2000's 'Tumble' bracelets. The strings of delicate semi-precious beads threaded onto a handwoven silk cord were an instant success, with Harvey Nichols and Fenwick among the big name stores to snap them up. After Halle Berry and Sarah Jessica Parker were seen in them, they became a style sensation with eager fashion fans queuing up to purchase theirs. Next came what would become Lola Rose's signature - the heart pendant, which is still a favourite today. 'I wanted to create jewellery that made women smile and feel happy when they wore it,' adds Gewirtz. 'A Lola Rose design is an affordable treat that will lift your spirits and make you feel very glamorous.' Along with Halle Berry and Sarah Jessica Parker, other big names left 'feeling glamorous' in Gewirtz' designs are Claudia Schiffer and Danni Minogue. The Duchess of Cambridge also remains a fan and has been spotted wearing Lola Rose's £45 crystal heart necklace. Fan: The Duchess of Cambridge is a fan and owns the jewellery label's £45 crystal heart pendant . Early adopter: Supermodel Claudia Schiffer was among the first to start wearing Gewirtz' designs . Celebrity following: Halle Berry and Sarah Jessica Parker both own the Lola Rose 'Tumble' bracelet . Now Gewirtz is hoping her unexpected success will encourage other budding designers to follow in her footsteps. 'I believe that we must celebrate British designers,' she explains. 'We have some of the finest in the world. 'It's the ability to think outside the box and break rules that results in the extraordinary and as a nation, we shine at turning things on their head and coming up with something unique.' With the MBE, Gewirtz becomes part of an elite club of designers to be recognised for their services to fashion. Among the designers to have honours bestowed on them in recent years are Betty Jackson who in 1987 was handed an MBE and in 2007 a CBE. Alice Temperley and Anya Hindmarch have both been handed gongs, as has Vivienne Westwood who turned up to collect her MBE in 1992 wearing no knickers beneath her dress. She repeated the trick for a second time in 2006 when she was invited to Buckingham Palace to collect a Damehood from Prince Charles.

"An Upstate New York couple say that after they complained to authorities multiple times about harassment by their neighbor - but in the end the prosecutor had them arrested, instead of him. Paul Sohacki and Katherine Gannon claim the threatening, abusive behavior they suffered from Gene Ellis at their home in Otsego County, New York, was so bad that they started recording every interaction with him. They both started wearing body cameras and carrying hand-held camcorders everywhere they went. They ringed their property with surveillance cameras, as well, ABC News reports. When they turned all of the videos over to District Attorney John Muehl and pressured them to do something about Mr Ellis - Muehl responded by arresting them for invasion of privacy instead. Scroll down for video . Paul Sohacki and Katherine Gannon claim they were harassed by their neighbor Gene Ellis. But when they turned over video to a prosecutor, he didn't see it that way and arrested them . Not-so-neighborly: Paul Sohacki and Katherine Gannon accuse their neighbor Gene Ellis of constantly harassing them. Videos they took show that often the confrontation was mutual . Muehl told ABC's 20/20 that he took something very different away from the videos than Mr Sohacki and Ms Gannon were expecting. Another neighbor confirmed Mr Ellis' version of events, which helped authorities decide to pursue charges. 'But really, if it hadn't been for this, Mr Sohacki and Ms Gannon bringing me the evidence against themselves, I wouldn’t have known, for sure, who to believe. But when I've got these videos where it’s clear that they are causing the issue,' the prosecutor said. He added: 'I believe they are obsessed with Gene Ellis.' The charges were later dropped before trial. The couple, who moved to their 15-acre property in Otsego County several years ago, claim they were set up by Mr Ellis and his friends. Videos that Mr Sohacki posted on YouTube show numerous confrontations between Mr Ellis and Mr Sohacki and Ms Gannon on their shared property line. In on exchange, Mr Sohacki walks up to  his property line, where Mr Ellis is posting 'No Trespassing' signs. 'Real imaginative Gene, putting up no trespassing signs,' Mr Sohacki jeers. Mr Ellis responded: 'I want you off my land. Stop lying, you and your wife. 'You're always trying to follow me around on my own property. This is my property. I've already been here for 20-something years. You only been here for three and nobody likes you.' The banter continues with Mr Ellis saying: 'Why can't you be a nice neighbor? I feel sorry for you. I really do.' Mr Sohacki responds: 'Lies roll off your tongue like it is incredible, Gene. What a frickin' liar.' Mr Ellis, done hanging the signs, ride off saying: 'I'm praying for you, Paul. I'm really praying for you, buddy.' In another confrontation, Mr Ellis yells that Mr Sohacki is throwing rocks at him - all while Mr Sohacki holds a camera and is clearly not throwing rocks. Paul Sohacki and Katherine Gannon own 12 acres in Upstate New York. Mr Ellis owns 50 - and yet they both found themselves fighting on opposite side of their property line on a regular basis . And in another video, Ms Gannon says she is out planting trees on her property when Mr Ellis rides up on a tractor about 50 yards away. They start shouting at each other. Ms Gannon accuses Mr Ellis of harassing her. He responds by saying: 'Why don't you get a life, Katherine? Why don't you get a job, instead of recording people and invading our privacy?' The dispute began because Mr Ellis' driveway crosses a sliver of Mr Sohacki's property. The incident escalated into a lawsuit and Mr Ellis - who owns 50 acres - agreed to move his driveway off their property. However, both sides say the harassment continued for years. Mr Ellis, who refused to talk to ABC News and could not be reached for comment by Daily Mail Online, recently moved away. Mr Sohacki and Ms Gannon are also preparing to move - though they say it is because Mr Sohacki got a job elsewhere in the country.","Paul Sohacki and Katherine Gannon say they were harassed by neighbor Gene Ellis for years and started recording him .

"Online abusers have set up Facebook hate pages attacking TV news anchor Reham Khan and her family after it was rumoured that she had married Pakistani politician Imran Khan. News of the potential union sparked outrage in Pakistan and trolls have now accused Ms Khan of being a lesbian for stroking a woman's back, and attempted to shame her for going to parties. Users have blasted her for wearing short skirts, slated her for dancing with unknown men in public, and branded her daughter a 'pornstar' while claiming to be in possession of topless pictures. One image even claims to show Ms Khan in a sex shop in the UK wearing a pink nightdress, with a collar around her neck and a whip slung over her shoulder. Scroll down for video . It was reported that cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan (left), was about to marry TV anchor Reham Khan (right), but his sister now says the news was a lie to damage his reputation in home country Pakistan . Backlash: Hate groups have already sprung up on Facebook where users have been sharing photos of her dancing and going out with friends while making abusive comments . Among the images posted by online abusers was this photograph, which they claim shows Ms Khan in a sex shop, wearing a night dress, suspenders, a collar and with a whip over her shoulder . Anger: The suggestion that Imran Khan could be about to marry Reham Khan, a divorced mother-of-three who used to work at the BBC, has caused outrage in conservative Pakistan . Mr Khan has today said rumours of marriage were 'greatly exaggerated', while his sister Aleema said the family challenged him 'a few days ago' over the news and he denied it. Aleema branded the reports lies, saying they had been concocted by Mr Khan's political enemies to damage his reputation. She told MailOnline: ‘This is the only way the opposition know how to attack him. These are the tactics they would stoop to. It’s out of control. I guess that is politics. ‘I spoke to my brother a few days ago and he said it isn’t true. 'We, the family, just asked him outright, have you married her? And he said no. I don’t know if they are in a relationship, here [in Pakistan] you are either getting married or you are not. ‘We’d be extremely happy if he marries a good person and settles down, of course we would. But it is not just his consideration, it’s a consideration for the country, it’s like a national-level decision. Online trolls have attacked Ms Khan for her appearance, dancing with unknown men, and attending parties . 'There are people in Pakistan who love him so much that everyone wants to participate in his private life, they feel he is their leader and should be part of his decision. ‘Everybody [we, the family] are taken aback at how much other people want to participate in this decision.’ Asked if her brother is in a secret relationship with the TV broadcaster, she said: ‘It’s a confusing signal to everyone who follows him [but] we asked him if he was married and he said no. I don’t know if he is in a relationship. We just asked him if he was married.’ Khan has since tweeted his followers, saying rumors of his marriage are 'greatly exaggerated'. Aleema also appeared in a YouTube video several months ago, alongside Imran's nephew, in which she again said the family had spoken to him about marriage, and he told her it was 'not the right time'. However sources close to both Reham and Imran have suggested they are in a relationship - but that Imran has now distanced himself from her amid political recriminations. A former staffer at the TV station where Reham is now an anchor said the pair used to meet any hour of the day or night without restrictions, . A producer at the station said Reham had 'very good access' to Imran, while his political party knew about the meetings and never tried to stop them. A family friend of Reham Khan, who wished not to be named said: ‘She had an affair some time back but it finished very quickly. 'Later, we learned that she was very serious with Imran Khan and there was news that Imran felt the same. 'But, I think after realising that he would be trapped in another problem, Imran has now put some distance between them.’ The online trolls have attempted to shame Ms Khan for wearing short skirts on TV and appearing to have wrinkles in some shots . Ms Khan, a divorced mother-of-three, was a BBC weather girl but is now a news anchor of AAJ TV . Aleema Khan  says the rumour was started by opposition politicians in Pakistan in order to damage her brother's reputation, but could not say whether he was in a secret relationship (file image) Imran's ex-wife Jemima Goldsmith revealed in October that she was ditching the surname ‘Khan’ and reverting to her family name because her ex-husband was about to remarry. She said at the time: ‘My ex-husband, Imran, recently announced that he intended to get remarried soon, which made me think it’s probably time to change my name back to Goldsmith.’ Another well-known news anchor in Pakistan, Farhat Javed Rabani, Tweeted on December 27: ‘Ahmmm... an anchor has married a politician today... ‪#WeddingBells’ Leading political commentator Dr Shahid Masood, who is a close friend of Imran Khan, said on television that Imran neither confirmed nor denied the news. He added that members of Imran’s political party, Tehreek-e-Insaf, confirmed that Reham wants to get actively get involved with his politics and sees herself a future first lady. Reaction to the rumoured marriage has been very negative in Pakistan and there has been a backlash on social media. Photos of Reham in revealing clothes and a video of her doing a tango while working for the BBC are prompting insulting comments in the conservative Islamic country. Aleema said that the family would be happy if Khan married a 'good person' but that the whole country would participate in the decision . Imran Khan, pictured left, has been single since he divorced Jemima Goldsmith, pictured right, 10 years ago . Rival political parties are jumping on the negative reaction and believe it will harm his credibility to marry a divorcee with an apparently chequered past. Reham, who was born in Libya to Pakistani parents, has three children from her previous marriage to a doctor. Khan's Tehreek-e-Insaf party currently holds the third largest bloc of seats in the country's parliament, but has accused the ruling Pakistan Muslim League and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of vote-rigging, and argue they should have more. In the past Khan has launched personal attacks on Mr Sharif, calling for the embattled leader, who won the 2013 general election by an apparent landslide, to resign.","Imran Khan was rumored to have married mother-of-three Reham Khan .

"Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson is reported to have reached a plea agreement that will allow him to plead no contest to misdemeanor reckless assault and therefore avoid prison. The deal would allow the football star to avoid a felony child-abuse conviction and instead be sentenced to probation and community service, plus a monetary fine. The disgraced football star, 29, had faced one felony count of reckless injury to a child after he was accused of striking his four-year-old son with a tree branch or switch at his gated mansion in The Woodlands. Scroll down for video . Vikings running back Peterson (seen in court with wife Ashley Brown) is reported to have reached a plea agreement that will allow him to plead no contest to misdemeanor reckless assault - and avoid jail time . If the agreement is accepted by Judge Kelly Case, Peterson will pay a $2,000 fine, be placed on probation, and perform 80 hours of community service, reports Pro Football Talk. Peterson’s plea, which comes less than four weeks before his trial on felony child-abuse charges was due to start, will not include reference to family violence or violence against a minor. Once Tuesday’s court appearance is out of the way, Peterson’s case becomes a pressing concern for the NFL who will quickly have to decide if they are going to impose a suspension on the running back above and beyond the eight games he has already missed with pay. Unless he is suspended for more than eight games, Peterson could be reinstated for the Vikings' next game against the Chicago Bears on November 16. Unless the NFL suspends Peterson for more than the eight games he has already missed, he could be reinstated for the Vikings' next game against the Chicago Bears on November 16 . Officially, Peterson remains on the commissioner's exempt list and is barred from all team activities. Peterson was due back in court on Tuesday for a hearing to revoke his bond after he allegedly admitted to smoking marijuana before his initial hearing in September. According to court documents, Peterson allegedly told a drug-testing administrator that he had recently 'smoke a little weed' before submitting to a urinalysis test. 'During this process the defendant admitted ... that he smoked a little weed,' according to the motion filed by Montgomery County District Attorney Brett Ligon. Peterson (above with one of his sons)  was arrested and posted $15,000 bond on September 12 on a charge of injury to a child . Peterson was arrested and posted $15,000 bond on September 12 on a charge of injury to a child. He was later suspended indefinitely with pay by the Vikings until the matter is resolved. He has admitted using a switch, the thin end of a tree branch, to discipline his son, but said he was not trying to injure him. Peterson could have been sentenced to up to two years in prison and fined $10,000 if convicted. The charge against Peterson came as the NFL faced public criticism for its handling of a spate of domestic violence cases among its players. A number of corporate sponsors rebuked America's most popular professional sports league, which has overhauled how it deals with player behavior and punishment.","Peterson's plea deal has been accepted in his child abuse case in Texas .

"The flu epidemic is raging across the country with 36 states reporting high levels of the outbreak, according to authorities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared a national flu epidemic on Tuesday as this year's, virulent mutated strain, the H3N2 virus, swept from coast to coast. The Midwest and southeast of the country were being hardest hit with cases. The CDC said the flu vaccine currently on the market doesn't prevent that strain's spread. Between October 1 and December 20, CDC figures show that 15 children have died from the virus and four in the week before Christmas. Scroll down for videos . The flu epidemic was raging across the country with 36 states seeing high levels of the outbreak . Six children in Tennessee have died this year from the flu, according to the state's Department of Health and so far East Tennessee Children's hospital has seen 442 children with flu this month. On Monday, Anne Arundel Medical Center in Maryland announced that an increased number of patients were coming to the hospital and visitors would be limited. Other Maryland hospitals including Sinai Hospital in Baltimore, Northwest Hospital in Randallstown and Johns Hopkins, also put precautions in place, according to CBS. Delaware has seen nearly ten times the number of flu cases this year compared to the same time period last year. Fever, chills . Cough, sore throat, runny nose, . Muscle aches . Headache . Fatigue, . Nausea . Source: CDC . The Delaware Division of Public Health says there were 632 reported flu cases through December 20.  For the same time period last year, there were just 70 flu cases. Health officials say the uptick reflects earlier influenza activity being reported throughout the country. Those particularly at risk are those over 65 and younger than four. Across the nation, 2,500 people have been hospitalized because of the growing crisis. According to the CDC, data from 122 U.S. cities showed deaths from influenza and pneumonia exceeded the national baseline and is at the epidemic threshold of 6.8 per cent. About 90 per cent of flu cases so far this year have been the virulent H3N2 sub-type, the CDC reported. Another state hit hard has been Minnesota, where health officials have made it clear to parents that this year's flu strain is particularly strong. The flu has proved fatal to children with no apparent underlying health problems and statistics from the Minnesota Department of Health have revealed that in some parts of the state up to 50 per cent of students have been absent in December while battling the illness. Shannon Zwanziger, a 17-year-old senior at Owatonna High School in Minnesota died at the Mayo Clinic in early December from the flu. Initially falling ill with a fever and sore throat, Shannon deteriorated at home and her heart stopped beating while she was in her mother's arms after being sick for one week. Despite the paramedics and best efforts, she passed away. The CDC admitted earlier this month that the vaccine does not protect well against the dominant strain, H3N2. That strain tends to cause more deaths and hospitalizations, especially in the elderly. 'Though we cannot predict what will happen the rest of this flu season, it's possible we may have a season that's more severe than most,' said CDC director, Dr Tom Frieden. Shannon Zwanziger, 17, from Minnesota, passed away in early December after contracting the flu . CDC officials think the vaccine should provide some protection and still are urging people to get vaccinated. Flu vaccine effectiveness tends to vary from year to year. Last winter, flu vaccine was 50 to 55 per cent effective overall, which experts consider relatively good. Among infectious diseases, flu is considered one of the nation's leading killers. On average, about 24,000 Americans die each flu season, according to the CDC. Nearly 150 million doses of flu vaccine have been distributed for this winter's flu season. Current flu vaccines are built to protect against three or four different kinds of flu virus, depending on the product. The ingredients are selected very early in the year, based on predictions of what strains will circulate the following winter. The ingredients always include a Type A H3N2 flu virus. The most severe flu seasons tend to be dominated by some version of that kind of flu bug. The three most deadly flu seasons of the last 10 years — in the winters of 2003-2004, 2007-2008, and 2012-2013 — were H3N2 seasons. Ineffective: A man receives a free flu shot from a Walgreens employee during a free flu shot clinic at Allen Temple Baptist Church on December 19, 2014 in Oakland, California . In March, after the H3N2 vaccine strain was vaccine production was underway, health officials noted the appearance new and different strain of H3N2. 'This is not something that's been around before,' Frieden said. But health officials weren't sure if the new strain would become a significant problem in the United States this winter until recently, they said. Lab specimens from patients have shown that the most commonly seen flu bug so far is the new strain of H3N2. Specifically, about 48 percent of the H3N2 samples seen so far were well matched to what's in the vaccine, but 52 percent were not, the CDC said. An official with one vaccine manufacturer — GlaxoSmithKline — emphasized that about half the samples do match the strain in the vaccine. He also noted flu seasons can sometimes involve a second wave of illnesses caused by a different strain. 'We're at the very beginning of flu season, and it's quite possible different strains will predominate,' said Dr. Leonard Friedland, director of scientific affairs for GSK's vaccines business.","The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared a national flu epidemic on Tuesday .

"A New York woman who infamously survived a cocaine-fueled three-way sex romp in a swanky Manhattan hotel that lead to the death of another woman has now been found dead of a suspected drug overdose. Nicole Zobkiw, 31, of Wantagh, was involved in the 2009 orgy with Long Island banana mogul Thomas Hoey Jr at $700-a-night suite at The Kitano hotel on Park Avenue, which ended in the death of personal trainer Kimberley Calo, 41. Calo, a mother of two, collapsed and began frothing at the mouth and bleeding from the nose on the April night after snorting too much of the potent cocaine, which was supplied by Hoey. Zobkiw was found dead 'or close to it' by her boyfriend on Wednesday, with police suspecting cocaine as the cause of death, The New York Post reported. Dead: Nicole Zobkiw, 31, of Wantagh, Long Island, was found dead Wednesday of a suspected cocaine overdose, according to reports. She was one third of a drug-fueled threesome that killed a woman in 2009 . Slip up: Banana mogul Thomas Hoey pleaded guilty in August to charges he supplied a sex partner with fatally potent cocaine and delayed calling for help when she overdosed during a three-way sex romp . Zobkiw was convicted of perjury in 2013 after lying to a grand jury about what happened on the night of Calo's death in order to protect Hoey, her ex-boyfriend. She had not yet been sentenced. Hoey finally admitted in federal court in August that he delayed calling for help when Calo starting having a seizure. The millionaire owner of Long Island Banana Corp even confessed he continued to supply friends with cocaine following Calo's gruesome death as he helped hamper authorities' efforts to bring him to justice through 2010. He also admitted to coercing Zobkiw to lie on the stand. Hoey . is charged with conspiracy to distribute cocaine, aiding in perjury . conspiracy and obstruction of justice, the Post reported, and is expected to get 11 years in prison. He will be sentenced in February. Hoey's guilty pleas were the culmination of years of speculation and . accusations regarding the importer's hard-partying and callous ways. Victim: Personal trainer and mother-of-two Kimberley Calo, 41, died in the Upper East Side's Kitano hotel after Thomas Hoey Jr neglected to call for help in time to save her following a cocaine binge . Hoey allegedly wasn't alarmed by Calo's condition and said 'he’d seen this before' and that she 'was going to be fine.' The . banana mogul had sex with Zobkiw and then set his attention towards . Calo, a personal trainer, retired NYPD detective Edward Boyle, who . investigated Calo's 2009 death, said on the stand in 2013. Calo . had first snorted the coke laying on a coffee table and when she went . back for more, she began overdosing and 'her head dropped to the table . with a thud,' Boyle told jurors at Manhattan federal court, where Zobkiw . was on trial for making false statements and perjury. Zobkiw was later found guilty of lying to a grand jury about the fatal party. The . court was told Zobkiw attempted to get Hoey to call the emergency . services but he refused, allegedly telling her that Calo would be fine. Zobkiw was seen in a security video going to the hotel reception three times to try and get help, Boyle revealed. Boyle told the court that Hoey assured Zobkiw that a 'doctor friend' was on the way. Hoey also admitted to coercing the other woman there that night, Nicole Zobkiw, to lie for him about the night's events while under oath (pictured is the scene of the tragedy, the Kitano Hotel) Zobkiw's lawyer Leonard Lato admitted his client had to tried to hide what happened on the night. But she was intimidated two days before her grand jury testimony in 2011 by a 'corrupt lawyer' allegedly linked to Hoey, Lato said. Under his new plea deal, Hoey faces 11 to 13 years in prison on federal charges. For the state charges he tampered with evidence by trying to clean up Calo's blood, Hoey faces four years. Hoey hit headlines again in August after his current girlfriend, Alison Bretherick, stood up for him in court in a separate case. Hoey was accused of beating Bretherick, 29, to a pulp in 2012. The attack left Bretherick bleeding from the scalp, unable to hear in one ear and with chipped teeth. She also reportedly feared Hoey so much that she had written on the back of a photo of her grandfather: 'If you find me dead, Thomas Hoey did it.' However Bretherick refused to turn on her man and, in court recently, denied ever being assaulted.","Nicole Zobkiw, 31, of Wantagh, Long Island, was found dead Wednesday .

"'I'm the boy who cried wolf': David Garrett Jr. says he made a post online that the FBI took as a serious threat against news orgnaizations . A hacking threat against CNN that rose to the FBI attention is actually a hoax, claims a freelance writer from Tennessee who is claiming responsibility for the post. David Garrett Jr., from Nashville, says he we the one who posted to the anonymous site 'pastebin' claiming to be Sony hackers the 'Guardians of Peace.' It included the bizarre demand that CNN should turn over anchor Wolf Blitzer. It is believed that the FBI issued a Joint Intelligence Bulletin based on that post that warned CNN and other media companies that hack attacks could be in the works. Mr Garrett, who rights about security issues for Examiner.com, revealed himself on Twitter today after news media organizations, including Daily Mail Online, picked up the story about the FBI warning. 'My fake pastbin post is being investigated by the FBI. I wrote for CNN to ""give us the Wolf"" and the FBI is actually taking it as a threat,' he tweeted. 'It was a joke. And to show that no one investigates anything. Everything is rumors. I had no idea it would be taken seriously.' He says he wrote the post to make the point that pastebin is an unreliable source and that anyone can post anything to the site. The Sony Hackers released several messages on the site - as well as links to the documents it pillaged from Sony Pictures. In a cryptic message, the poster claims to be the 'GOP' and says: 'The result of investigation by CNN is so excellent that you might have seen what we were doing with your own eyes.' 'Give us the Wolf': David Garnett now says he made the bizarre demand to prove that his anonymous post to CNN was a joke . The message was posted on the same forum where the hackers released the hacked Sony documents - an anonymous online forum called pastebin . 'We congratulate you success. CNN is the BEST in the world.' The message ends: 'P.S. You have 24 hours to give us the Wolf.' Mr Garrett says he is being interviewed by FBI agents. He also posted several screen grabs that appear to prove he is the pastebin user who made the post. In a Joint Intelligence Bulletin sent out to US companies on Christmas Eve, the FBI warned that hackers could begin targeting one news organization - and other media companies that reported on the hack Sony attack. The US government says that North Korean hackers attacked Sony Pictures and released a trove of emails and personal information of employees as retaliation against the release of 'The Interview.' The Seth Rogen comedy is about the assassination of Kim Jong-un and depicts his violent death.

"North Korea has released footage of leader Kim Jong Un carrying out pre-flight checks then reportedly flying a plane in a new television documentary. The video begins showing the 31-year-old sitting in the cockpit of what is believed to be a Antonov -148 aircraft and making pre-flight checks by glancing over a flight manual as well as holding on to the controls. It then cuts to a shot showing the back of Kim's head while he another pilot guide the plane down the runway for take-off. Scroll down for video . In the new footage, Kim Jong Un is seen looking at a flight manual as part of pre-flight checks . The North Korea leader puts is manual down and prepares to take handle the controls of the Antonov -148 aircraft . The pair can be seen holding on to the same lever before the North Korean leader appears to take control of the plane. After showing scenic footage of hills and rivers, while patriotic marching music is played in the background. Kim can then be seen pointing out of the window at the landscape before the plane comes into land. And when it touches down, Kim appears to land the plane with just one hand on the controls. It is unclear when or where the footage was taken. The plane then makes its way down the runway, with Kim appearing to be at the controls alongside a co-pilot . During the clip, the exterior of the plane is never shown, and it is often claimed that he tries his hands at plane controls even though he is not known to have nay qualifications as a pilot . However during the clip, the exterior of the plane is never shown and when it appears he is flying the plane, only the back of his head is visible. Earlier this year, a South Korean newspaper observed that Kim appears keen to show that he does not suffer the same pathological fear of flying as his father, Kim Jong-il, who travelled as far as he could get on a special armoured train. They claimed that he often tries his hands at the controls, although he is not known to have any qualifications as a pilot. 'Kim Jong-un likes steering aircraft,' a senior government source in Seoul was quoted as saying in the South's capital, Seoul in May. An undated picture of Kim Jong Un released yesterday. Earlier this year, a government source in South Korea said Kim 'likes steering aircraft' Kim's wife is presumed to support his preference for flying around North Korea, rather than travelling by road or train as her father is said to have been a pilot. The clip showing the young leader is one of a number that has been released recently after he wasn't seen in public for more tha 40 days. No official reason was given for his disapperance and it is thought he was suffering from ill health. In recent state TV footage of Kim his weight appears to have ballooned - thanks in part to an addiction to Swiss cheese. He has also been seen walking with a limp since an event with key officials in July and in a pre-recorded documentary broadcast by state media earlier this year, he appeared to have difficulty walking.","Footage released by North Korea shows Kim Jong Un 'flying' a plane .

"If you want to be sent home from work, or are thinking about pulling a sickie - this could be the make-up for you. From 'eye smiles' tape to create the look of puffy  bags, to canine teeth extensions for a crooked smile, Japan's beauty ideals starkly contrast those in the west. Add to that the latest launch - a red, under-eye blusher - and you have the tools to make yourself look rather unwell in minutes. Creator TCB is raising funds on Makuake to  take the Little Red Riding Hood palette into production . The look was pioneered by Ranzuki, a mag with the tagline 'I can be the cutest and most stylish girl in class' Known as 'byojaku face', the Asian trend involves making yourself look a bit under the weather, and is hugely popular in Japan. Online illustrator name TCB on Twitter created the Little Red Riding Hood palette concept, which was inspired by fairy tales. It has set up a campaign on crowdfunding site Makuake to try to make the idea into a reality. The project has already met its initial goal of 1,000,000 yen (£5,370). The makeup opens up like a book and features under-eyeshadow in bright red, beige, brown and white. According to Japanese school girls, a sickly face consists of pale skin and worried brows . Red around the eyes gives the impression that its wearer is slightly fey . Rather than sweeping blusher diagonally along the cheekbone from mouth, or even dabbing it on the apples of your cheeks, the new place for it to go is directly underneath your eyes. The red around the eyes gives the impression that its wearer is slightly unwell or as if they've been crying, and in need of looking after. It can also make you look like you've been outdoors in cold weather - in-keeping with the Mori girl style of 'a girl who lives in the forest' (lace, soft leather, sturdy boots, gypsy tops, patterned tights). Those who donate 3,500 yen (£18) or more to the effort by the deadline of February 16  will receive a Little Red Riding Hood palette when they go into production in 2015.

"The Brooklyn cop killer is believed to have carried the gun he used to shoot dead two officers in a Styrofoam food container as he calmly walked through the city streets, according to investigators. Ismaaiyl Brinsley left the box at the scene after he murdered NYPD officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu - but no food was found inside, according to a new report on Wednesday by The Daily Beast. NYPD investigators are trying to piece together Brinsley's movements on December 20 in the hours before he walked up to the officers shortly before 3pm and shot them at point-blank range  in their patrol car in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood. Scroll down for video . Surveillance footage from December 20 revealed cop killer Ismaaiyl Brinsley casually strolling through Brooklyn carrying a fast-food container. Investigators now believe that the handgun was inside . Ismaaiyl Brinsley shot two New York police officers as they sat in their car in Brooklyn before taking his own life in a subway station . Brinsley then ran into a nearby subway station and took his own life with the same gun. One senior investigator told The Daily Beast that colleagues of the two slain officers felt it was their duty to piece together that terrible day. 'This is the highest honor a detective can have, investigating the murder of a fellow police officer,' the investigator reportedly said. Surveillance footage uncovered by the NYPD revealed Brinsley chatting on a cellphone while casually sauntering around carrying a white plastic bag which appears to be covering a container. He appeared to be attempting to hold the container upright and steady on the footage from the Atlantic Terminal Mall. At one point Brinsley used his back to open a glass door rather than upset the container. Police now believe that Brinsley's semi-automatic handgun was inside the entire time as he made his two-mile journey through Brooklyn. Brinsley appeared to be attempting to hold the container upright and steady on the footage from the Atlantic Terminal Mall . The footage showed the killer backing through a glass door at the mall as if afraid to upset the container. Investigators now believe that Brinsley was carrying a handgun in the box . On the morning of December 20, Brinsley shot his ex-girlfriend and posted an online death threat against police, according to investigators in Maryland. They used cellphone-tracking technology to follow his journey, via bus, to New York City in real time. He was tracked using the GPS transmitter on a cellphone he had stolen from his ex-girlfriend. Along the way, he posted threatening messages on social media including a vow to 'put wings on pigs'. The transmissions, or 'pings,' showed he was traveling northbound on a bus on Interstate 95 that arrived in Manhattan at 10.49am. He then took the subway to Brooklyn, where he used the stolen phone to make posts to Instagram. Officers Rafael Ramos, left, and Wenjian Liu, right, were shot dead by Brinsley in their police car on December 20 . Ismaaiyl Brinsley, pictured, killed NYPD officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu, hours after posting threatens online against the police . One showed his bloodied green shoe. The other showed his pistol. 'I'm Putting Wings On Pigs Today They Take 1 Of Ours...... Let's Take 2 of Theirs #ShootThePolice,' he wrote. At 12:07pm, Brinsley ditched the phone near the Barclays Center arena and disappeared. Baltimore County police said they became aware of the Instagram postings at about 1.30pm. They first tried calling a precinct in Coney Island but were told to call the precinct in the Flatbush neighborhood and had a conversation with police there around 2.10pm. Police say the flier with Brinsley's photo was then faxed, at the NYPD's request, to a Brooklyn command at 2:46pm. It warned that he was in Brooklyn, armed with a semi-automatic handgun and was saying online that 'he will shoot a police officer today.' Two minutes later, Brinsley opened fire. Moments later, he committed suicide - likely around the same time the Teletype was sent to NYPD headquarters in Manhattan. Police on both ends say they took immediate and proper measures to try to alert officers about an armed and dangerous fugitive bent on violence against law enforcement. But the seemingly antiquated way they did it has raised questions about the potential for communication lapses to hamper urgent manhunts. Though refusing to fault how the warning was handled, Commissioner Bratton has called it 'an irony' the ambush occurred a time when the NYPD has launched a $160 million program to equip each member of the 35,000-officer force with a department-issued computer tablet or smartphone to improve information-sharing. Investigators were able to track Brinsley on surveillance footage because of his distinctive jacket (pictured) Message: A wanted flier for Brinsley came too late, and was sent a mere two minutes before Brinsley walked up to a patrol car and shot the two NYPD officers without warning . Currently, police departments in New York, Los Angeles, Denver and elsewhere mostly rely on dispatchers to make radio transmissions giving descriptions of suspects or fliers - copied and faxed - with mug shots passed out at roll calls. Smaller forces have gone to blasting notifications to department-issued smartphones, but most larger ones say to do the same would be too expensive. In the case of Brinsley, it's impossible to know whether an earlier warning would have made a difference. Even if that information had been received earlier, all an officer sitting in a radio car would have received, Bratton said, 'was an alert on the description of a black male, mid-20s, that basically is making threats against police officers'. NYPD officers  stand for a moment of silence to mark the murders of two of their fellow officers. One investigator of the shootings reportedly said: 'This is the highest honor a detective can have, investigating the murder of a fellow police officer'","Ismaaiyl Brinsley reportedly left the box after he murdered NYPD officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu - but no food was found inside .

"A new book written by a panel of men seeks to advise women on the 'do's and don'ts' of dating from a brutally honest male perspective. Written by seven New York-based men who are both in and out of relationships, Single Man, Married Man argues that 'every man want to get married' and poses a blunt question to its female readers: 'So why not with you?' 'No matter where a woman was in life, she should always be able to cater to her man’s needs,' one single author writes in an extract published by DNAinfo, while a divorced co-author advises: 'When he gets his ego stroked, he will be more inclined to love you more.' Scroll down for video . You're doing it wrong: Written by seven New York-based men who are both in and out of relationships, Single Man, Married Man argues that 'all men' want to get hitched and poses, 'so why not with you?' Single Man, Married Man was compiled by childhood friends Jean Alerte, a 33-year-old married businessman who owns a Brooklyn yogurt shop, and Frank Gateau, a 32-year-old 'serial dater' who works in PR. Other co-authors include entrepreneur Jickael Bazin, blogger Rae Holliday, life coach Pervis Taylor III, writer Zangba Thomson and musicians DJ Fadelf and Kel Spencer. 'Where exactly did the romance go now that Prince Charming barely pays attention to you anymore?' the book's website reads. 'It takes a lot to hold their attention, and men tend to lose interest in romantic partners when they stop being, well... interesting.' Mr Alerte and Mr Gateau - who claim that when men say they don't want to get married, they're 'lying' - spent three years surveying more than 300 male subjects online and in person to arrive at their conclusions. One contributor described as single mentions the song 'Cater 2 U' by Destiny's Child as being an anthem that 'should be on every woman’s playlist and kept on repeat.' He advises: 'Prepare his meals, draw him a bath and massage his feet every now and then.' Another author, this time married, claims that if a man doesn't want to argue with you, it does not mean he is 'weak.' He suggests: 'It possibly alludes to the exact opposite, that he possesses an inner strength to make the intelligent decision to exit the situation.' Marriage manual: The book (pictured) hits bookstores February 10, and promises answers to those 'burning questions you've never been able to ask' On a chapter which deals with 'why men lie', a single man suggests that telling the truth is 'risky' and that lies are perpetuated 'to get our women to listen to us.' And then there's the million-dollar question. Why do men cheat? One man, again single, joked that while a man can 'cheat on his woman' and still 'sleep like a baby' in the same bed, switching his barber will make him feel 'bad.' Said gentleman described this foible as 'hilariously funny and true.' He also warned that for men, a new career can often trigger temptation to cheat. 'We are exposed to a new supply of women who weren’t previously available, so we feel the need to explore these potential new mates that are now accessible,' he states. A divorced contributor put cheating down to man being a 'natural predator' who will only stop 'stalking his prey' when a woman either 'gives in' or 'ignores his every advance.' The Single Man, Married Man website lists a selection of reviews of the book, almost all from women. 'I'm sure ladies will appreciate this book', wrote Natasha, from San Francisco, California, dubbing it 'very refreshing.' 'I found myself agreeing and caught myself saying ""yes, yes"",' wrote Cindy from Atlanta, Georgia. Single Man Married Man is available for pre-order online and hits bookstores February 10.

Lake Superior State University has released its annual List of Words Banished from the Queen's English for Misuse, Overuse, and General Uselessness. The 40th annual list was culled from nominations received mainly from the university's website, according to the LSSU website. The list, released Wednesday, includes words like 'bae,' 'foodie,' 'Swag,' and 'cra-cra.' The 12 words that make up the list are now among the more than 800 entries the list has seen since its creators published the first list in 1976. According to the university's website, the list is complied by 'word-watchers' who 'target pet peeves from everyday speech as well as from the news, fields of education, technology, advertising, politics and more.' And in December, a committee makes the final cut. According to the university, 'bae' was one of 2014's top nominees. Evie Dunagan from Mannheim, PA defined the term which means 'before anything else' and said 'How stupid! Stop calling your boyfriend 'bae'.' James Becker from Holly, MI described the term of affection as a 'dumb, annoying word.' A phrase that made it on the list is 'skill set,' apparently, people feel there is no need to combine the two words. 'Why use two words when one will do? We already have a perfectly good word in 'skills' (ending with an s, not a z),' Chip Lupo from Columbia, S.C. said on the university's website. Disappear: This tweet from Bowdeya Tweh illustrates the popular opinion that 'bae' needs to disappear from our vocabulary as we bring in the new year . After many nominations over the years, the word 'swag,' describing the totality of one's style, personality, and demeanor, which has recently fallen out of popularity, finally made the list. 'The word 'swag' has become a shapeless, meaningless word used in various forms (such as 'swaggy') but with no real depth,' Bailey Anderson from Washington, Iowa said. Vocabulary: Though the list is not enforced, the university has once again let society know which words need to be cut from our vocabulary (photographed is a tweet from Nick Sheltrown) Banished: In this tweet, Erin Monigold expresses her gratitude for the universityplacing 'bae' on its list of banished words . Though the list is not enforced, the university has once again let society know which words needs to disappear from our vocabulary. However, the new year isn't here yet.

"The family of a Texas man who was shot dead on Christmas night by his neighbor claims he may have been sleepwalking at the time. Spencer Crandall of Rhome was banging on the door of his neighbor's house and ringing the bell when the incident occurred, sometime around 4am on December 26. And when that neighbor saw Crandall trying to crawl over a privacy fence on the property he retrieved a firearm and, when a brief struggle ensued and Crandall attempted to enter the front door of the home, the owner shot him dead. It is being reported that the incident occurred at the home of Craig Rigtrub, who did not know Crandall. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Spencer Crandall (above with wife Amanda) was killed as he tried to enter his neighbor's home on Christmas night . Bright future: Now, Spencer's family members are saying the young man, who was married earlier this year, was likely just sleepwalking at the time . Site: The incident happened at the home of Craig Rigtrub (above) 'He [the homeowner] told Mr. Crandall he was armed, ""This is not your house."" He was still trying to get in, at that point the homeowner fired one round and striked Mr. Crandall to the chest,' Wise County Sheriff David Walker told ABC News. The owner's daughter called 911 during the incident, and when the authorities arrived on the scene Crandall was dead. This as Crandall’s wife, Amanda Crandall, who was away at the time, revealed to police that her husband had a history of sleepwalking, and may not have been aware of his actions at the time. Making the sleepwalking worse may have been the fact that Spencer was also taking muscle relaxants to help with a ruptured disc in his back. On top of that, with his wife away, Spencer may have also been drinking beer according to his brother Ryan. Spencer and his wife Amanda were just married earlier this year. 'He was hurting really, really bad on Christmas Eve,' Ryan told WFAA. 'He would only have obtained it for the purpose of dealing with his back pain.' 'We may not ever know why he was trying to get into the house,' said Sheriff Walker. The incident is said to have occurred at the home of Craig Rigtrub (above), who did not know Crandall . Together: Days before the horrific incident the entire family gathered for a holiday photo . Spencer's sister Jessica meanwhile took to Facebook to speak about the tragedy, writing; 'On Dec. 26, my sweet, precious brother Spencer's life was taken away from us. I will never get over the sorrow of losing him so early in life, he was only 31, but together with our family I know we will get through this tragedy.' She then added; 'Thank you to our friends and family who continue to lift us up with your love and prayers. We love Spencer. His wife Amanda will always be part of our family.' Even more heartbreaking is the fact that the entire family wad together just days before as they took a Christmas Eve photo. No charges have been filed against the homeowner, whose name has not been released.","Spencer Crandall of Wise County, Texas was shot dead by his neighbor on Christmas night as he tried to enter the man's home .

"In 1977, William McPherson earned the top honor in the writing world when he was honored with a Pulitzer Prize. But nearly four decades later, the former Washington Post critic now hovers on the brink of poverty  thanks to a failing pension and a bit of bad luck on the stock market. In a heartbreaking essay for The Hedgehog Review, McPherson describes what it's like to become poor in old age - as part of a overlooked group who are neither middle or lower class. Former teachers and even lawyers who can't pay their bills but aren't on the streets begging for change. Surprisingly, he says the experience has been educational and that he still considers himself privileged due to his race. What it's like to be poor: Pulitzer Prize winning writer William McPherson (pictured) wrote a heartbreaking essay about his descent into poverty . 'Compared with most poor people, I am fortunate,' he wrote. 'If you’ve got to be poor, finding yourself at the upper edge of poverty with a roof over your head and a wardrobe that doesn’t look as if it came from the Salvation Army is as good as it gets. 'It also helps to be white.' McPherson relays a terrible anecdote in which his former personal trainer Jeff, who is African-American, sees a client walking on the street. When he tried to greet her, the woman immediately wrote him off and said 'I don't have any, I don't have any money'. She didn't even look up to recognize the man she saw regularly at the gym. 'She didn't see Jeff; she saw a black man in trainers about to ask her for a handout on one of the busier avenues in the city. Jeff doesn’t look like a hustler. He doesn’t look poor. I don’t look poor, either, but I am white. So I never suffered that kind of demeaning slight.' McPherson started at the Washington Post as a copy boy but worked his way up to book editor during his 25 off-and-on years at the paper. Seventeen years into his tenure at the Post, McPherson left to work at a New York publishing agency - just a year before profit-sharing would have taken effect. Eventually, the Post's editor coaxed McPherson back to journalism where he went to cover Eastern Europe after the fall of Communism and win a Pulitzer Prize for this critical writing. It was when he decided to leave for Europe that McPherson's first financial problems started happening - but he didn't know their repercussions at the time. Worthless: The 81-year-old spent 25 years working at the Washington Post, but after deciding to take an early retirement in 1986, his pension is now worth half what he saved . Against the advice of more stock market-saavy friends, McPherson invested in AOL before it was popular and Apple when the tech company was at a low. He made good money when both stocks bounded, but lost that money when he handed over his capital to a manager to travel Europe. Like many Americans, he lost a lot of money when the stock market crashed. Then, in 1986, when McPherson was in the middle of a leave of absence, the Post asked him to either come back to work or take an early retirement. 'I was fifty-three at the time. I chose retirement because I was under the illusion—perhaps delusion is the more accurate word—that I could make a living as a writer and the Post offered to keep me on their medical insurance program, which at the time was very good and very cheap,' McPherson wrote. However, that choice proved costly since by the time his pension kicked in at age 65, the money he had saved on the Post's 401(k) plan was half it's worth since it is not adjusted for inflation. While McPherson's $11,670 income puts him above the poverty line (which last year was a close $11,490), he still considers himself poor 'by any rational standard'. He is forced to live in subsidized housing, with neighbors including a great-grandson of Leo Tolstoy, former lawyers, academics and fellow writers. The District of Columbia is also subsidizing his medical insurance payments, after a  major heart attack left him with astronomical bills. However, he doesn't blame his misfortune on the economy. When he was younger he says he was 'foolish, careless and sometimes stupid' spending money without thinking of the long-term consequences. While he doesn't regret any of it, he doesn't like having to rely on his family for so much now that he is older. 'Sometimes, I find it deeply humiliating that I am dependent on such kindnesses when I would prefer that the kindnesses flow the other way. Most of the time, though, I am just extremely grateful for the help of family and friends. It’s not so much humiliating as it is humbling, which is a good thing.'","William McPherson spent 25 years working at the Washington Post, but because he retired early his pension is now worth half what he saved .
The 81-year-old now makes $11,670 a year from social security and his retirement, which puts him just above the poverty line ."
"A family shamed by a trendy restaurant on social media for walking out without paying their bill have now settled their tab. Burger & Lobster posted a CCTV picture on its company Facebook page showing a mystery family apparently leaving its new restaurant in The Hayes, Cardiff. Next to the photograph, a staff member wrote: 'To this family that walked out tonight without paying their bill, we are sure this was just a 'mistake' and you completely forgot, so out of the goodness of your heart please call the restaurant tomorrow to pay the bill. Thanks.' Burger & Lobster posted this CCTV picture on its company Facebook page showing a mystery family walking out of its new restaurant in The Hayes, Cardiff. In the caption, staff claimed the group did not pay their bill . The post, which appeared on Facebook this week, triggered a flood of protests from other customers who were furious at the family being 'shamed' in public over the apparent bill blunder. However, Burger & Lobster insisted today that the post was 'made with the intention of encouraging the guest in question to come back and pay for their mistake to rectify the loss for the business.' A spokesman said the family had now settled the tab for their meal – which is thought to have cost in the region of £80. The spokesman said: 'It wasn't done with the purpose of naming and shaming anyone as we are well aware that these things happen. 'As a company we take our social media policy seriously - it was posted at a local level and has now been removed. 'The table in question has now come forward and paid their bill so thank you to those who provided us with any information. 'We have taken the decision to donate the money from the bill payment to the charity Safer Wales.' The CCTV picture posted by Burger & Lobster on Facebook showed a man dressed in a smart grey suit jacket and jeans, a woman in a dress with a thick overcoat and two other women dressed in black trousers, scarves and coats. They appeared to be leaving the city centre restaurant. More than 600 people commented on the image that was available for the restaurant's 3,200 fans, before the food chain deleted it. The restaurant chain accused the family of walking out of its Burger & Lobster branch in Cardiff (above) It sparked fury among diners, with some blasting the restaurant - which offers either burger or lobster with sides - for the 'very public shaming' of the unnamed family. Francesca Coles, a regular customer at the trendy chain said: 'People make mistakes like this all the time, especially if there is a few of them. 'I've had to go back and pay after leaving and realising. Not a very professional approach by this food chain if these customers have left in error! 'I don't like the way in which you operate and puts me off ever coming into your establishment again! Disgusting!' Fellow customer Oliver Price said: 'Genuinely a disgrace posting this on a social media platform. 'If this is a mistake and they come back and pay how are you going to 're-inform' everyone who saw this that they made a genuine error. Terrific social faux par here.' Mink Kleekai added: 'Disgraceful action by the restaurant, they have given this family little time to make amends before trying to publicly shame them on social media. 'Totally unprofessional management of this situation, which makes you wonder if the front and back of house are also mismanaged.' However, while several people appeared to be against the restaurant's actions, some customers supported the post. Chris George said: 'People moaning about the photo annoys me! If they paid there want be a problem!! 100 people prob went to that restaurant and didn't have their photo put on Facebook cause they paid for their meal!!! (sic).' Kristen McDougal said: 'You did 100 per cent the right thing by posting the photos,' while Tom Weaver simply added: 'You did right.' The Cardiff city centre restaurant has only been open for a month and, in line with other Burger & Lobster restaurants in the country, has just three items on the menu - a burger, lobster or a lobster roll with fries and salad. Everything at the restaurant costs £20 so it's likely the family's bill came to around £80, or slightly more with drinks. It is likely the family of four spent about £80 at the Cardiff city centre restaurant because everything at the trendy chain - which only offers burger or lobster - costs £20. Burger & Lobster also has branches in London . The first Burger & Lobster opened in Mayfair, London, in December 2011 and it was followed by a second, larger restaurant in Soho in July the following year. It has since opened several other branches in the capital in Farringdon, Bread Street, Fitzrovia and on the fifth floor of Harvey Nichols in Knightsbridge. The Cardiff restaurant, the most recent to be opened by the chain, is the first UK branch to be unveiled outside of London. The only other branch of Burger & Lobster, which is operated by Russian steakhouse group Goodman Restaurants, is the American flagship in New York - which came after its success in Britain. The trendy chain boasts on its website as offering 'some of the best lobster around for just £20', and aims to appeal to customers by having no menu. Instead of perusing a list of options for their meal, diners simply choose whether they wish to order burger, lobster or a lobster roll.","Burger & Lobster posted photo of family online and claimed they didn't pay .

"Ferguson, Missouri police officers were shot at Tuesday night, as they tried to investigate a burglary call at one of the town's many buildings burned down in anti-cop riots. Officers were called to the shell of the old Beauty Town store on West Florissant Avenue on Tuesday night around 6pm, and found several suspects stealing hair products from the building's basement. While trying to arrest the suspects, the officers heard gunfire coming from the Park Ridge Apartments located behind the store. Scroll down for video .

Tensions in the community became even more heated in November, when a grand jury decided not to indict Wilson on any charges related to the teen's killing. The night the grand jury decision was announced, rioters took to the streets of Ferguson and burned down about a dozen buildings and destroyed ever more cars as police tried to combat the crowd with tear gas. Beauty Town was one of the several stores destroyed in the fire and looting, and the owner has set up a fund to raise money to rebuild. So far the fund has raise $6,015 of its $30,000 goal.

"The death penalty is being sought for a couple who allegedly tortured their three-year-old son in a house of horrors where dents in the wall are though to show where they hung him upside down to whip him. Jillian Tait, 31, and Gary Lee Fellenbaum, 23, are charged with murdering Tait's son, Scott McMillan. The Chester County District Attorney's Office told the pair at their arraignments this week that prosecutors will seek the death penalty against them because the boy died by torture and was younger than 12. The death penalty is being sought for a Jillian Tait, 31, (right)  and Gary Lee Fellenbaum, 23 (left), a couple who tortured their three-year-old son in a house of horrors where dents in the wall allegedly show where they hung him upside down to whip him . 'American horror story': Scott McMillan, three, was tortured for weeks and beaten with a frying pan until he eventually died, prosecutors in Pennsylvania have said . Arrested: Amber Fellenbaum, 21, has been charged with child endangerment for allegedly witnessing the beatings of three-year-old Scott McMillan but doing nothing to stop them . Officials said the Pennsylvania couple went car shopping, bought pizza and took a nap as Scott lay dying after weeks of escalating abuse that ended in three days of systematic torture. They are accused of laughing as Scott was hung upside down and whipped, striking him repeatedly with a frying pan, and eventually beating him to death. Chester County District Attorney Thomas Hogan called the case 'an American horror story.' 'It was an unspeakable act of depravity,' he said. Noting that investigators found no evidence that drugs or alcohol had been involved, he said: 'This is just evilness.' The couple met working at Wal-Mart and last month moved in together, along with Fellenbaum's estranged wife and three children — Tait's 6- and 3-year-old sons and the Fellenbaums' 11-month-old daughter. The six lived in a mobile home park outside the city of Coatesville, about 35 miles northwest of Philadelphia. The prosecutor said what started as spankings morphed into 'concentrated, repeated, escalating abuse.' Then, 'over three days he was systematically tortured and beaten to death,' Hogan said. Torture tool: The Chester County District Attorney came across a horrifying scene when they entered the pair's trailer home in Pennsylvania. This is one of the whips that was believed to have been used to strike Scott . Sickening: Investigators found holes in the wall where Fellenbaum had allegedly smashed Scott's head . Death bed: The mattress where Scott was put on after Fellenbaum allegedly beat him until he was unresponsive is covered in blankets and clothes. The pair had sex and ate pizza as Scott lay there dying . The three adults told authorities 'that Scott McMillan had been punched and beaten with blunt and sharp objects, whipped, taped to a chair with electrical tape and beaten, hung up by his feet and beaten, and suffered other acts of violence,' police said in affidavits. 'During one incident,' the affidavits say, 'Gary hung Scott and (his older brother) up by their feet one at a time and beat the boys while they were hanging upside down. Jillian stated that she and Gary were laughing during the incident.' Hogan said the older brother apparently knew that if he struggled while being hung from the back of a door, it would only get worse. But his younger brother squirmed and struggled, he said. 'They thought that was funny,' he said. Fellenbaum's 21-year-old estranged wife, Amber Fellenbaum, was charged with child endangerment for allegedly failing to help the toddler. She ultimately called 911 Tuesday night, authorities said. By then, Scott had been unresponsive for hours and had been put in a shower for more than 30 minutes by his mother and her boyfriend, investigators said. Weapon: A bent curtain rod was also found, which attorneys believe was another item used to hit the boy . Sickening: Another whip, put together using electrical tape which was also used to tie Scott to chairs, was found on the floor in another part of their home . When the boy failed to awaken, they placed him on an uninflated air mattress and went shopping, authorities said. Gary Fellenbaum severely beat the boy for refusing to eat toast both Monday and Tuesday morning, authorities said. The 'discipline' included throwing him against a wall, knocking him off a chair with a punch and then taping him to the chair to keep him upright for more beatings, police said.

The mob posted mock eviction notices outside of the police building. 'We are informing you that the police department is scheduled to be reclaimed by its citizens today, December 31, 2014,' said the notice. Police attempted to remove the protesters from the building and even used pepper spray on some. 'We’re a public building, we’re open. But we’re open for legitimate business. We’re not open for people to come in and push their own agendas and disrupt the business that has to go on here,' said Police chief Sam Dotson.

In neighboring Ferguson, Missouri, police officers were shot at on Tuesday night, as they tried to investigate a burglary call at one of the town's many buildings burned down in anti-cop riots. Officers were called to the shell of the old Beauty Town store on West Florissant Avenue on Tuesday night around 6pm, and found several suspects stealing hair products from the building's basement. While trying to arrest the suspects, the officers heard gunfire coming from the Park Ridge Apartments located behind the store.

The suburb of St Louis has been embroiled in turmoil ever since local teen Michael Brown was shot dead this past summer in an altercation with police officer Darren Wilson. Tensions in the community became even more heated in November, when a grand jury decided not to indict Wilson on any charges related to the teen's killing. The night the grand jury decision was announced, rioters took to the streets of Ferguson and burned down about a dozen buildings and destroyed ever more cars as police tried to combat the crowd with tear gas. Beauty Town was one of the several stores destroyed in the fire and looting, and the owner has set up a fund to raise money to rebuild. So far the fund has raise $6,015 of its $30,000 goal.

"A 95-year-old man has died weeks after his 96-year-old wife was taken from him by family members embroiled in an inheritance row. Eddie Harrison passed away on Tuesday at a hospital in Virginia  following a bout of influenza. He apparently became distressed when one of his daughter-in-laws left home with his spouse, Edith Hill, in a bid to protect her share of assets. Scroll down for video . Longtime loves: Eddie Harrison passed away on Tuesday at a hospital in Virginia weeks after his 96-year-old wife, Edith Hill, was taken from him by family members embroiled in an inheritance row . The two had been friends for years before they married earlier this year . The couple married in Alexandria earlier this year after being friends for more than a decade and that's where the trouble started. Their union was investigated because Hill had been declared legally incapacitated for several years and some family members were worried about their inheritance. The senior's estate included property on the edge of Old Town Alexandria, worth about $475,000, according to real estate assessments. There was also concern about who would care for Hill and where she would live. During the investigation Hill and Harrison said they wanted to stay together. 'I guess I wanted company,' Hill said in an interview, explaining why she married. 'I wanted somebody I could help, and they could help me. We were both single. My husband was gone. His wife was gone. We became the best of friends.' Hill met Harrison after striking up conversation in a queue for lottery tickets, with one of the tickets turning into a $2,500 winner. After years of friendship the duo decided to tie the knot. Along with their age, the interracial aspect of the marriage was also unique, with Hill being black and Harrison being white. In fact, the longtime Virginians would not have been allowed to marry if they had met in their 20s or 30s or 40s, given state's law banning interracial marriages at the time. One of Hill's daughters, Rebecca Wright, supported the marriage while her other daughter, Patricia Barber, contested the arrangement. A judge appointed a new guardian for Hill to protect her interests, removing Barber and Wright as guardians, but decided to leave the marriage intact. On December 6, Hill's guardian arrived to take Hill away to Barber's home in Florida for what was supposed to be a two-week vacation. Police were called to the home during a traumatic 40-minute negotiation to convince Hill to leave, Wright said. When Hill did not return home as planned after two weeks, Harrison reportedly began to realize she was not coming back. Daisy Birch, a family friend, said Harrison was heartbroken. He also became ill with the flu and checked himself into a hospital. A dispute continues between the two sisters, Barber and Wright, over Hill's affairs and place of residence.","Eddie Harrison passed away on Tuesday at a hospital in Virginia following a bout of influenza .

"Many of us will vow to give up alcohol this month, due to the toll it takes on our looks and health. But should it be coffee we’re quitting instead? What started out as a morning treat has turned into a number of caffeine fixes to get us through the day. But like booze, regularly consuming more than the safe daily limit of caffeine (between 200 and 400 mg, equivalent to two large Americanos at a High Street chain) is undoubtedly bad for us. While it may stimulate the tastebuds and keep us alert, drinking too much coffee can pile on the pounds, age our skin, and even be responsible for cystitis, cellulite and bad breath. TANITH CAREY reports. Your skin looks older . These days, it seems no one goes anywhere without a takeout coffee cup. But the habit could lead to prematurely older-looking skin, according to nutritionist Marisa Peer. ‘One coffee is no worse than a glass of wine, but you can have too much of it,’ she says. ‘Skin needs lots of water to look plump and glowing. But coffee is a diuretic, encouraging your body to flush out water. If you drink too much coffee, your skin will look as dehydrated as when you have a hangover.’ Scroll down for video . Coffee is a diuretic, encouraging your body to flush out water. If you drink too much coffee, your skin will look as dehydrated as when you have a hangover (picture posed by a model) Flooding your body with caffeine means your nervous system is in a constant state of artificial stimulation, adds Marisa. ‘Skin is your largest organ and needs oxygen-rich blood. When the body is in a state of stress, it responds by directing the most highly-oxygenated blood towards the heart and lungs, so skin doesn’t get as well nourished. ‘The lymphatic system, which clears waste products, also doesn’t work as efficiently, leaving skin sluggish and breakout-prone.’ You get cellulite . Caffeine is an ingredient in some skin creams — but that doesn’t mean drinking it will have the same positive effect. There are 16,501 coffee shops in the UK, with sales growing by 6.4 per cent from last year . ‘Coffee is used in many anti-cellulite creams — applied to the outside of the skin, it draws out the stored toxins in the fat cells, thereby reducing cellulite,’ says nutritionist Vicki Edgson, author of Gut Gastronomy, which looks at the latest evidence on how to revitalise the digestive system. She adds that dehydration caused by coffee encourages the skin to become congested and hardened and to form a dense mesh, which leads to cellulite. You get bad breath . like alcohol, coffee dehydrates your mouth, says dentist Dr Sameer Patel, of the Elleven Dental Practice in London. ‘As a result, there’s less saliva to rinse your mouth and fight bacteria.’ And if you drink milky coffee, this allows the milky residue to ferment and rot, giving off noxious smells, he adds. Over time, caffeine can turn teeth yellow in the same way as nicotine from cigarettes. Dentist Dr Mayank Morar of AP Smilecare, in Blackburn, says: ‘Coffee contain tannins — plant compounds which give these drinks their flavour — and acids. Over time, these break down the enamel on teeth’s surface. ‘The tannins penetrate the surface and stick to the enamel. Over time, that can make the teeth look yellow or brown.’ You put on weight . A Starbucks whole milk Venti Caffe Latte has 299 calories — while the apparently less fattening semi-skimmed version has only 50 fewer calories . It’s known that drinking too much booze can make you pile on the pounds. But your coffee habit may also be to blame. For example, a Starbucks whole milk Venti Caffe Latte has 299 calories — while the apparently less fattening semi-skimmed version has only 50 fewer calories. That’s more than a 250ml glass of white wine at 185 calories. If we grab a carbohydrate treat, such as a muffin, at the counter, coffee’s effect on blood sugar makes those goodies even more fattening, a study by the University of Guelph in Canada found. Nutritional therapist Shani Shaker says caffeine interferes with insulin levels, which control how much fat our bodies store. ‘In the Canadian study, it was found people having the coffee and carbs combination tripled their blood sugar levels, while insulin was reduced by half. ‘This combination of high blood glucose levels and poor insulin function is a recipe for weight gain and increased risk of diabetes, as the excess blood glucose is dumped into storage as fat.’ Celebrity trainer Christianne Wolff, author of The Body Rescue Plan, says all her clients who have given up caffeine have lost weight. ‘Caffeine can affect people’s sleep, which means they are more tired during the day,’ she says. ‘This can lead to weight gain as they crave carbs and sugar and are less likely to have the energy to exercise.’ You have bad toilet habits . Drinking more than three cups of coffee a day has a diuretic effect on the body, because it interferes with the hormones that regulate our water balance. This leaves us dehydrated and makes urine more concentrated and acidic, inflaming the walls of the bladder and even leading to painful urination and cystitis. In a study by the University of Alabama, of 1,356 women who drank around three cups of coffee or more a day, 70 per cent were more likely to have bladder problems. In fact, women who suffer from urinary incontinence are advised by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence to cut back on coffee. You’re tired all the time . The energy boost we get from a shot of coffee is short-lived. Coffee keeps us artificially wired by stimulating the adrenals — two walnut-size glands sitting on top of your kidneys, which control stress hormones. It can be hard to tell how much caffeine we are drinking when buying coffee. Glasgow University researchers bought single-shot espressos from 20 coffee shops in the city and measured their caffeine content. Four had more than 200mg in a single cup — the strongest had more than 300mg, almost at the daily accepted safe amount. The energy boost we get from a shot of coffee is short-lived. Coffee keeps us artificially wired by stimulating the adrenals — which control stress hormones (picture posed by a model) If the levels of fight-or-flight hormone are constantly raised by a flood of caffeine during the day, raising heart and breathing rates and muscle tension, this can cause long-term fatigue. Factor in that it takes from five to 12 hours for the body to get rid of caffeine and, when you fall into bed, you may still not be able to sleep. Once you do nod off, coffee makes sleep lighter and more disturbed. Studies have found this is because caffeine interferes with the production of melatonin, which helps us sleep. A study in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine found drinking caffeine as much as six hours before bed significantly disturbs sleep, reducing total sleep by over an hour. Every day’s a bad hair day . Caffeine has been found to flush vital minerals, including iron needed for healthy hair growth, out of the body. The effect is thinning hair, according to Cassandra Barns, nutritionist at nutricentre.com. ‘Our body needs good supplies of certain vitamins and minerals for good hair condition and pigmentation, including biotin, selenium, zinc and copper. Coffee can flush out vital minerals needed by the body for healthy hair growth causing thinning hair . ‘If we consume lots of coffee, this will affect our mineral stores, which could have a negative impact on hair condition, including shine and texture.’ The loss of minerals may even trigger hair loss and premature greyness. ‘One of the primary causes of hair loss in women before menopause is low levels of iron, and coffee affects their absorption of that. Copper is thought to contribute to hair pigmentation, so any deficiency may cause early greying.’ Trichologist Iain Sallis says women are more at risk of caffeine-induced hair loss than men. ‘Lack of iron shortens the hair’s growth cycle, making it fall out more quickly,’ he says. ‘This is especially so for women, who are more susceptible because of low iron levels due to blood loss during their menstrual cycles.’ You find it harder to conceive . If you are thinking of having a baby, fertility expert Zita West advises cutting back on coffee. Studies in the British Journal of Pharmacology show caffeine stops the muscles in the Fallopian tubes in the ovaries from contracting. These rhythmic contractions waft the egg from the ovaries to the womb to be met by sperm. Instead, the egg gets ‘stuck’. Other research has found a link between caffeine and conception problems. Dutch researchers at Radbout University found women who drink more than 300mg of caffeine a day (two 8oz cups of coffee) have a 27 per cent lower chance of getting pregnant, compared with women who don’t drink it. Once conception has taken place, more than one coffee a day can put your unborn baby at risk, as caffeine has been found to constrict blood vessels and interfere with hormone levels. One study found women who drink more than 200mg of caffeine a day have double the miscarriage rate, compared with non-drinkers. The studies have led the NHS to advise pregnant women to have no more than two cups of instant coffee a day. Zita says: ‘If you are trying for a baby, it would be wiser to regard coffee as an occasional treat.’","These days its rare not to see a Starbucks on every corner .

"The early hours of November 4, 1902, and Police Constable No. 472 of the St Pancras Police Division was walking his beat in the mean streets around St Pancras station in London. He had just turned into Weirs Passage, an unlit alley off Chalton Street, when he heard a faint cry. Flashing his torch, he realised that the noise came from a bundle of rags left on the freezing pavement. When he bent down to investigate, he saw that the bundle contained a baby boy. That foundling grew up to be my grand-father. In old age, he wrote a vivid fragment of childhood memoir, recording everything he knew about the remarkable journey that began — and almost ended — on the London streets that cold winter night. Percy Chalton (pictured) was found in a dark alley behind St Pancras station in 1902 by Police Constable No. 472 of the St Pancras Police Division while he was walking his beat . It was the early 20th century and Somers Town — the area around St Pancras — was a slum district, home to the rackety street life that accumulates in places where people are constantly on their way to somewhere else. In the middle of Somers Town stood the St Pancras Workhouse, and it was there that the foundling was taken. He was arbitrarily assigned a birthday of May 1, 1902, baptised Percy Chalton after the street where he was found (his surname was later altered to Charlton) and despatched to an orphanage at Leavesden, near Watford. That first Christmas in the orphanage was one of many lonely childhood Christmases he would spend in institutions or foster care with people who treated him unkindly, until at last his fortunes took a happier turn. His memories of childhood began at the orphanage. The first thing he could recall was being roughly bathed by a nursemaid who threatened to fill his mouth with soap if he didn’t stop crying for his favourite nurse, Hetty. She was, he wrote later, ‘my first friend, and I often remembered her kindness in my small world of unkindness’. When Percy was five years old, he was sent to board with foster parents in the Essex village of Hatfield Broad Oak. Back then, there were no particular qualifications for being a foster parent. Any married couple or ‘respectable widow’ could apply, as long as they were recommended by a Church of England clergyman. When Percy (pictured) was five years old, he was sent to board with foster parents in the Essex village of Hatfield Broad Oak . A weekly payment of four shillings was a powerful incentive to foster a child at a time when a farm labourer earned around 14 shillings a week. Percy’s first impressions of his foster mother were not encouraging. ‘The very size of her, together with her dress and appearance, was forbidding and frightening,’ he wrote. Bewildered and miserable, he sobbed as he followed this terrifying person to the cottage that was to be his new home. The house was small, with a living room and scullery on the ground floor, two bedrooms on the first floor — where his foster mother, her meek husband and their three children, Arthur, John and Dorothy, slept — and a little attic bedroom where Percy was quartered. The floor was bare boards, the only light came from a small latticed window on the landing, and the eaves sloped so sharply that he could reach out and touch them as he lay in bed. All his life, Percy suffered from nightmares of being crushed, which he was convinced came from being confined in this cramped room. His forebodings about his foster mother proved cruelly justified. With a reputation in the village as a shrew and a scold, she bullied her husband and children — but reserved her worst unkindness for her orphan foster son. When he tried to dispose of the disgusting boiled-suet pudding she dished up every Monday by hiding it in his pockets, she sewed them up. She dosed him forcibly with laxatives and beat him with a stick that hung on the kitchen wall. When her husband tried to protect the child, she beat him as well. When the couple’s eldest son, Arthur, died of pneumonia, things became even harsher. Percy’s foster mother seemed to blame him for being alive while Arthur was dead. Percy was no longer allowed to play with his foster siblings, forbidden even to speak to them and eventually banished from the family table at mealtimes. Instead, he had to eat standing up in the pantry, using the mangle as a table. The worst thing of all, he remembered, was being made to hand back his Scout uniform within an hour of getting it. It had been given to him by the local vicar, and Percy wore it home proudly, but his foster mother — who seemed to loathe anything that made him happy — forced him to take it off. She then bundled it into a parcel and told him to return it to the vicarage. That final cruelty turned into one of the rare strokes of good fortune that changed the direction of my grandfather’s life. The vicar of St Mary’s, Hatfield, was Canon Francis W. Galpin, a kind, cultivated man who was an expert in church music. Percy had a good treble voice and sang in the church choir. When he arrived, disconsolate, to return his Scout uniform, Canon Galpin decided that something must be done. He was one of three boys in his year selected to take the scholarship exam for Bishop’s Stortford Grammar School, although he was successful it was decided that Percy's (pictured) future lay in the Royal Navy. He arranged for Percy to move to a different foster home with Julia Burton, the village postmistress. She had married a soldier who fought in the Boer War but he was killed in an accident within a few months of the wedding and she brought up their son alone, with a succession of foster children. She was brave, hard-working and kind, and my grandfather stayed in touch with her until the end of her long life. She is there in his wedding photos — a sweet-faced woman in a cloche hat — and I have a faint childhood memory of visiting a very old lady in a black dress, who sat very upright in a high-backed chair beneath a stained-glass window. For the first time in his life, Percy learned what it was to be an ordinary boy in a pre-war village in rural Essex. He went fishing for sticklebacks, keeping a sharp look-out for the big pike that was said to lurk in the stream and attack small boys. He rode the roundabouts at the village fair, where he marvelled at the strong man and the bearded lady. He carried stone gallon jars of beer to the farm-workers at harvest-time, and earned halfpennies to spend on bags of broken biscuits by helping the old man who wound the church clock. When Percy married Ethel Rose, he gained a family at last — she was the youngest of 13 children of a London publican and his wife (pictured here on their wedding day) He was a bright little boy, and although his ill-treatment in his first foster home had left him with a crippling stammer, he thrived at school. He was one of three boys in his year to take the scholarship exam for Bishop’s Stortford Grammar School. All three were successful but the Board of Guardians of St Pancras Workhouse — shadowy figures who still had the power to decide Percy’s fate — concluded that he wasn’t eligible to accept the scholarship. Instead they decided that his future lay in the Royal Navy. More than 50 years later, my grandfather wrote: ‘I don’t remember being very sorry for myself at the news. The fact that I was to leave the village was itself a matter of great excitement and yearning. I was perhaps conscious that there were better things elsewhere.’ In earlier moments of despair, he added, he had often thought of running away to sea. The event that really troubled him came two years later. Before joining the Navy he was required to swear his age before a local magistrate. He was given an envelope to hand to the magistrate, and when he looked at the documents inside, Percy had a huge shock. Percy's story is one of sadness and hardship but also courage and resilience. He is pictured here with his wife Ethel and their two granddaughters . He’d always thought that his parents had given him up to an orphanage. No one had explained that he was a foundling — with no family at all. ‘I’d always hoped that one day I would be reunited with my real father and mother, and perhaps with brothers and sisters,’ he wrote. ‘I was more conscious than ever of being alone.’ It wasn’t until I had a baby of my own that I realised there was an even more poignant layer of sadness to his story. The truth is that my grandfather wasn’t a newborn when he was found but a healthy baby of about six months. For half a year, someone had taken good care of him before some desperate circumstance forced her to conclude he would be better off lying on the cold ground in a dark alley on a winter’s night than staying with her. But if my grandfather’s story is one of hardship, cruelty and loss, it is also one of courage, resilience and cheerfulness. After joining the Navy as a boy sailor, he retired at the commissioned rank of Lieutenant Commander. He missed World War I by a month but served on convoys during World War II and was mentioned in despatches. And when he married my grandmother, Ethel Rose, he gained a family at last — she was the youngest of 13 children of a London publican and his wife. Percy and Ethel had a daughter and two granddaughters — my sister and me. And some of my happiest childhood memories are of sitting with him at this time of year, listening to his stories of when he was a little boy — all alone in the world and dreaming of running away to sea.","Percy Charlton was found by a Police Constable walking his beat .

"A 17-year-old boy who hid a loaded AK-47 assault rifle in a school bathroom and two loaded handguns in his backpack intended to ‘commit a violent act,’ a school official said, but the plan was foiled when his parents discovered the weapons missing at home and alerted school administrators in San Antonio, Texas.

After the campus was searched, the lockdown ended at 11:30 a.m. There were no reports of injuries or shots being fired. The boy's parents awoke about 6 a.m. to find the boy missing, Chancellor said. They called San Antonio police to report him as a runaway. When they discovered the missing weapons, they rushed to the school to speak with administrators, she said. Parents pickup their kids, students at Madison High School in San Antonio after a student was found to have brought weapons to school and had pledged to 'commit a violent act' using an AK-47 assault rifle on Monday . The boy's plan was foiled when his parents discovered the weapons missing at home and alerted school administrators in San Antonio, Texas . Their son, a sophomore, was pulled from class and the handguns and ammunition were discovered in his backpack. His parents then asked what he did with the AK-47. Chancellor said when he was confronted by administrators and his parents, the boy said he intended to make a series of demands during morning announcements. If those demands weren't met he vowed to use the weapons to ‘commit a violent act.’ What the 17-year-old was going to demand hasn’t been made clear. Police intend to charge him as an adult, on one count of making terroristic threats and another count of being in possession of weapons in a prohibited place, Chancellor said. Parents wait in front of Madison High School in San Antonio on Monday after an unnamed student was caught with weapons . ‘We can have every safety tool possible but at the end of the day what it comes down to is students, staff, parents, everyone being alert,’ she said. ‘And if something seems out of place then letting someone know.

"A small selection of people in China will finally be able to access banned sites including Facebook, Twitter and other 'politically sensitive' links from this weekend. The ban was placed on the sites in 2009 following riots in the country and China's ruling Communist Party has restricted access ever since.

China Morning Post. A small selection of people living and working in the 17-square-mile free-trade zone in Shanghai, China will be able to access banned sites including Facebook, Twitter and other 'politically sensitive' links from this weekend, according to reports in the South China Morning Post.

The New York Times has been blocked . since reporting last year that the family of then-Premier Wen Jiabao had . amassed a huge fortune. Citing unidentified government sources, the Hong Kong newspaper also said authorities would welcome bids from foreign telecoms firms for licences to provide internet services in the zone. China's Communist Party aggressively censors the internet, routinely deleting online postings and blocking access to websites it deems inappropriate or politically sensitive. Facebook and Twitter were blocked by Beijing in mid-2009 following deadly riots in the western province of Xinjiang that authorities say were abetted by the social networking sites. The New York Times has been blocked since reporting last year that the family of then-Premier Wen Jiabao had amassed a huge fortune. The recently-approved Shanghai FTZ is said to be a 'test bed' for convertibility of China's yuan currency and further liberalisation of interest rates, as well as reforms of foreign direct investment and taxation, the State Council, or cabinet, has said. The zone is set to formally launch on 29 September. South China Morning Post quoted a government source as saying the idea of unblocking websites in the FTZ was to make foreigners 'feel like at home'. 'If they can't get onto Facebook or read The New York Times, they may naturally wonder how special the free-trade zone is compared with the rest of China,' the source added. A spokesman for Facebook said the company had no comment on the newspaper report. No one at Twitter or the New York Times was immediately available to comment.

This map shows the spread of Facebook users worldwide, highlighting the rising popularity of the site in Africa, South America, and India. The black hole over China is because the site has been banned following riots in Xinjiang four years ago, which authorities attributed, in part, to the influence of social networks . Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that making Facebook available in China is in keeping with his company's goal of connecting the world. Earlier this month, Facebook CEO Sheryl Sandberg met with the head of China's State Council Information Office during a visit to Beijing. The pair discussed Facebook's importance as Chinese enterprises continue to expand abroad 'and various cooperation matters around that,' according to a post on the Council's website. Twitter, which is preparing for an initial public offering, could also benefit by being available in China, the world's largest Internet market by users. Still, many Chinese Web users already use similar services, such as Sina Corp's Weibo. China's three biggest telecoms companies - China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom - have been informed of the decision to allow foreign competition in the FTZ, the sources told the newspaper. The three state-owned companies had not raised complaints because they knew the decision had been endorsed by Chinese leadership including Premier Li Keqiang, who has backed the Shanghai FTZ, the sources added.","China's government blocked Facebook in 2009 following riots in Xinjiang .

"When a fan wrote a letter to Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning back in September requesting her husband meet him, it was Manning who had to run several yards to meet her family, singling out her letter from the thousands. Kristen Patterson wrote Manning a letter on September 21 requesting that he meet her soldier husband, Army Sgt. Ryan Patterson, a super fan who would stream games at all hours of the night while stationed in Afghanistan for two years. Indy Star reports that Army Sgt. Ryan Patterson of the 1/25 Stryker Brigade Combat Team grew up watching Peyton Manning and even tried to get stationed in Colorado so he could watch Broncos games. Meeting: Kristen Patterson, her daughter Olivia, and her husband Ryan Patterson were thrilled to meet Peyton Manning (right) after he tracked them down all the way in Alaska after receiving fan mail from them . Happy family: Ryan Patterson, Kristen Patterson, and Olivia Patterson got to meet their favorite football player Peyton Manning last month after he tracked them down thousands of miles away in Alaska . ‘My name is Kristen Patterson. I am writing to ask a question. You see my husband is a HUGE fan, and when I say HUGE I mean it. He is currently serving our country in the United States Army and has deployed twice to Afghanistan. He would set alarms to wake up at odd hours in the night just to listen to your football games. We recently had to move across the country for the Army and he tried to get us stationed in Colorado just so he could ensure that he would never miss your games,’ reads the touching letter sent months ago. Ryan Patterson was stationed all the way in North Pole, Alaska roughly 3,950 miles from where they were stationed first stationed in in Fort Campbell, Kentucky and a far stretch away from Denver where the Bronco's play. Along with Ryan Patterson moved his wife Kristen and their 10-month-old daughter Olivia. Kristen Patterson's letter stood out to Manning but Kristen neglected to leave her contact information and it took Manning three months to find her after enlisting the help from the Broncos' public relations team. Manning's public relations group was eventually able to contact a utility number in Alaska who called State Troopers who called Kristen Patterson to give her the good news. Actually, to ensure the meeting would be a surprise, the state trooper called Ryan Patterson's phone and asked for his wife. Kristen told her husband she received a phone call about a pole K9 demonstration at the school where she worked. 'When I got a call from (an Alaska) State Trooper they asked if I wrote a letter to Peyton Manning,' Patterson said. 'They said the Denver Broncos were trying to get a hold of me. When I sent it, you never know if someone is going to read it or if it is going to be tossed in a pile. So I thought they never read it, no big deal.' Patterson arranged with Manning team to meet him in Cincinnati on December 21 at a hotel where the team was staying. Best wife ever: Ryan Patterson told reporters his wife Kristen was the best wife ever after she arranged for him to meet his favorite football player Peyton Manning . She tried to keep the meeting a surprise for her husband but when they arrived at the hotel where the Broncos were staying her husband caught wind of what was going on. The Patterson's say that Manning was a kind and welcoming gentleman. 'The team's flight was delayed, so I was pacing the room like I was expecting a child. I saw (Manning) come up the escalator and my first reaction was he is at least 15 feet tall, if not taller,' said Ryan Patterson, who felt blessed to meet Manning and also get an autographed football. 'Peyton introduced himself, asked my daughter's name and played with her for a second and thanked me for my service.' Ryan Patterson said Manning was pleased to meet him and that he is extremely grateful for his thoughtful wife. 'He seemed genuinely tickled that we lived in North Pole, Alaska. He said, '""You guys are really hard to find'"" Patterson said. 'Before he left he shook my hand and thanked me for my service one more time and I thanked him for being my quarterback,' he added. 'Kristen) enjoyed the fact that she is the greatest wife ever and there was nothing I could ever do to top this. ""If you asked me who is the one person, anybody in the world, I want to meet, I would immediately say Peyton Manning and she made that happen,' he concluded. Tracked down fans: Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning spent three months tracking down fans for the opportunity to give them a special meeting .","Kristen Patterson wrote Manning a letter on September 21 requesting that he meet her soldier husband, Army Sgt.

"Arnold Ferrier is a man who openly admits he’s rather admiring of what he sees in the mirror. And so he should. For the 45-year-old IT executive has a grooming ritual on a par with that of a supermodel — he works out every day and refuses to drink alcohol or eat carbohydrates on week days. But he also has another beauty secret, one done in private behind the bolted bathroom door of the four-bedroom home he shares with his fiancee and her young son in Hove, West Sussex. 45-year-old IT executive, Arnold Ferrier, started shaving his chest two years ago and he's not the only one, a study by Mintel last year found that 13 per cent of men have removed their chest hair . Every week, he spends the best part of an hour shaving his chest. First he washes the area with one of his favourite upmarket soaps, then he applies some L’Oreal For Men shaving foam and removes the offending hair with a razor. Afterwards, he lovingly massages in a post-shave healing lotion before applying tinted moisturiser. While such a routine might sound peculiar for a heterosexual father-of-two, for Arnold it’s a luxurious moment of ‘me’ time that he wouldn’t be without. ‘When I dress after having shaved my chest,’ he says, ‘I can only describe it as the wonderful feeling you get when you’ve changed your bed sheets and then slip into them or stay in a posh hotel with fabulous Egyptian-cotton bed linen. When your smooth, hairless skin touches crisply ironed natural fabric, it’s the most wonderful sensation, there’s nothing like it.’ Men with smooth chests such as David Beckham (pictured), Cristiano Ronaldo and Tom Cruise are now held up as style icons rather than their hirsute counterparts of the 20th century . Not only do Arnold’s two teenage children find his habit ridiculous, but so does his fiancee Laura. Indeed, she says, if she’d discovered how obsessed he was with his grooming habits at their first meeting a year ago, there wouldn’t have been a second. ‘When I found out I was absolutely horrified,’ remembers 40-year-old Laura, a sleep counsellor and mother to Joe, seven. ‘We laugh about it now but I was quite disgusted at the time. ‘When we first got intimate, my initial reaction was to recoil in horror. At the gym, the guys like that are a total turn-off. They look so vain — they’re always admiring themselves in the mirror. ‘I’ve had to accept that Arnold is exceedingly vain. It’s pointless me trying to stop him indulging in his grooming habits. It’s constant, I do come second place to his reflection.’ Rather worryingly for those who cling to the idea that a hairy chest is a sign of virility, Arnold isn’t an anomaly. Indeed, it’s part of a growing trend among middle-aged men. Researchers even have a term for it — ‘manscaping’. A study by Mintel last year found that 13 per cent of men have removed their chest hair and one-in-five feel expected to remove hair from their torso. Bernadette Harte, non-surgical training manager at The Harley Medical Group, puts this down to the 2012 Olympics: ‘Suddenly ordinary men were constantly exposed to athletic, fit and hairless bodies. They wanted to emulate them. They started working out and removing body hair too.’ Indeed, it seems no British male is immune to temptation — the survey found 22 per cent of over-65s felt pressure to remove or groom body hair. Perhaps it’s no wonder. Men with smooth chests such as David Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo and Tom Cruise are now held up as style icons rather than their hirsute counterparts of the 20th century. Indeed Arnold cites Ronaldo as his icon. ‘When you look at the chests of today,’ he claims, ‘Ronaldo is the ultimate pin-up. It’s completely clear of hair and extremely well-toned and sculpted. He’s like a Greek God.’ Arnold's fiancee Laura (pictured) was horrified when she first saw Arnold's chest. She says: 'We laugh about it now but I was quite disgusted at the time' Arnold started shaving his chest two years ago, after coming out of a seven-year relationship, and denies it’s in any way narcissistic. ‘With all of the stress involved [in the break-up], I’d let myself go,’ he says. ‘One of my goals was to get in shape. There’s no better indicator of being on the road to success at 45 than if you can see your abs in the mirror. I was hairy — it was hiding what was underneath. That was a motivating factor to start shaving, so that I could see the improvements under the hair.’ While Arnold denies he’s undergoing a mid-life crisis, Bernadette Harte believes that this is often the case for 40-something men. ‘If a chap is back on the market then the last thing he wants to see is grey hairs on his chest. If they’re already discreetly dying their hair then they’ll remove the give-away ageing signs on their chest. ‘Society has moved on — they read the magazines, they go to the gym, they even talk to each other about it. Men today don’t want to look younger, they want to look good for their age.’ Daniel Remon, 40, a building engineer and stepfather to four children aged 15 to 26, has been shaving his chest and legs since his late teens. ‘I was 12 when I developed a moustache,’ says Daniel, who lives with his wife Jacqui in Symonds Yat, Herefordshire. ‘It was always commented on in the changing rooms that I was really hairy. I was teased relentlessly. ‘When I reached my late teens, someone dared me to shave off all of my hair. I thought it looked quite neat, I enjoyed the sensation of having smooth, hair-free skin. That’s why I carried on doing it.’ Even so, until recently it’s a habit that he’s kept to himself. ‘There has been a social prejudice that men can’t do this kind of thing. Girlfriends in the past couldn’t stand it and it has ended relationships. One in particular couldn’t come to terms with me preferring to be hairless. ‘Even my 15-year-old stepson called me “gay” and said I’m “bizarre” when he found out I shaved everywhere. But I’d rather be smooth than hirsute.’ Jacqui, a 52-year-old writer, is accepting of his habit. ‘I know a lot of men in their 40s and 50s who do it and they’re all normal blokes in normal jobs. It’s not just for metrosexuals or gay men any more. Among my social circle are men who are quite vain — they dress nicely, do their nails and look after themselves. Dan is vain, I’ve come to accept that.’ As with Daniel, 48-year-old Chris Nurding’s trigger to shave his chest also came about in his teens, but for a far more serious reason. ‘I was 18 and I’d just passed my driving test when I was involved in a horrific car accident. I spent months in hospital. Arnold cites Cristiano Ronaldo (pictured) as his icon. ‘When you look at the chests of today,’ he claims, ‘Ronaldo is the ultimate pin-up. It’s completely clear of hair and extremely well-toned and sculpted' ‘When I was discharged, I was just 6st. At 5ft 11in I was desperately underweight and part of my rehabilitation included physiotherapy and weights. ‘I got into developing my chest and to chart my progress it was a natural step for me to shave. It made a difference seeing the skin and muscle tone develop. ‘It was 1985 and that kind of behaviour for a man wasn’t the norm. I did keep quiet about it. Everyone would snigger at oily, hair-free bodybuilders. I certainly didn’t want to be mocked either.’ The property developer, who lives with partner Kristina Papapetrou, 43, an art therapist, in Barnet, North London, has continued his habit to this day, relying on an electric razor to shave both his head and chest once a week. ‘While I keep in shape, I don’t go to the gym any more, but I still like to shave my chest. If I’m renovating a property, it’s often too hot with body hair. I genuinely think I look better without a hairy chest. Women prefer it, too. In my experience, not many women like rugs.’ Chris’s partner Kristina discovered by surprise that Chris shaved his chest when they were on holiday. ‘I thought it was really lovely he took pride in how he looked. I enjoy dressing up, putting on make-up, ensuring my hair looks nice for Chris and I like that he takes an interest in himself for me too. ‘Chris feels good about himself and more confident. It’s a good thing for middle-aged men to do.’","Arnold Ferrier began shaving his chest two years ago .

"A Utah woman was arrested Tuesday in a bizarre case in which police say she stole the identity of a real attorney, opened her own law office and even represented at least on client in court. Police say Karla Cabo, 29, even hired a bar certified attorney for her fake firm. As recently as December 23, Cabo--who posed as a Ms. Karla Stirling Fierro--showed up to a district court representing an alleged criminal and even signed legal papers as his official counsel. 'There were a couple of things she said that kind of raised my eyebrows,' Summit County attorney Matthew Bates recalled from that day in an interview with Deseret News. 'But it wasn't enough to make me dig any deeper because we get attorneys from other parts of the state or newer defense attorneys all the time.' Karla Cabo, 29, (left) was arrested this week for stealing the identity and bar number of attorney Karla Stirling (right) and then practicing law in her name . Per Utah law, attorneys must give their name and bar number when they appear in court. They do not, however, have to show photo identification. And Cabo, police say, conveniently had a bar number, one that belonged to attorney Karla Stirling. Why she came up with the Fierro is anyone's guess. The California and Utah-based attorney she allegedly impersonated certainly hasn't a clue. 'It's been shocking to hear that there's been somebody else whose doing this with my name and my bar number,' Karla Stirling told Deseret. 'I mean, who would take it that far to full-on impersonate someone and use a legitimate bar number?' Stirling said she worries about the clients whose cases could have been harmed by Cabo's lack of any legal training. For the client she represented in court December 23, the judge will likely give him a chance to--if they so choose--take back his original guilty plea. 'Legally, he has pretty solid grounds to withdraw his plea if he wanted to because the plea was essentially uncounseled. and an uncounseled plea is a violation of the Constitution,' Bates said. As for Cabo, she's charged with identity theft, two counts of forgery and one count of communications fraud, reports KTSU.","Karla Cabo, 29, of South Jordan allegedly posed as a Karla Stirling Fierro using a false bar number .

"When Elon Musk split up with wife, Talulah Riley, for the first time, he told the whole world. 'It was an amazing four years. I will love you forever,' the entrepreneur Tweeted to the British actress in January 2012. 'You will make someone very happy one day.' Eighteen months later, that happy person apparently was him, as they tied the knot again in July 2013. Scroll down for video . Split again: California billionaire Elon Musk and actress wife Talulah Riley were together for a year after they remarried, but they have lived apart the past five months . The rekindled romance didn't last. On Wednesday — the day many people make vows for the coming year — the couple officially broke their marital vow. Musk filed for divorce in Los Angeles County Superior Court on New Year's Eve. The couple said they were splitting amicably and that Musk agreed to give Riley $16million in cash and other assets as part of a financial settlement, according to a joint statement. A divorce filing said property would be split based on a prenuptial agreement. Musk made a fortune co-founding PayPal and has gone on to start SpaceX and Tesla Motors. Riley, 29, appeared in Pride & Prejudice, Inception and St. Trinians. The couple first wed in 2010. They didn't have any children, but Musk has five sons from a previous marriage. Musk and Riley were together for a year after they remarried, but they have lived apart the past five months while Riley wrote and directed her first feature film, 'Scottish Mussel,' in the United Kingdom. Talented  duo: Musk made a fortune co-founding PayPal and has gone on to start SpaceX and Tesla Motors. Riley appeared in 'Pride & Prejudice,' 'Inception' and 'St. Trinians.' Entrepreneur: Space X mastermind Musk and actress Riley were together for a year after they remarried, but they have lived apart the past five months while Riley wrote and directed her first feature film, 'Scottish Mussel,' in the United Kingdom. Who get's what? In 2013, Elon Musk bought this 20,000-square-foot Bel Air home for a reported $17 million. A divorce filing said the couple's property would be split based on a prenuptial agreement. Elon Musk was married to Canadian novelist Justine Musk for eight years--long enough for her to bear his five sons and to become, in her own words, his 'starter wife.' In a tell-all 2010 interview with Marie Claire, the former Mrs. Musk said: . In the late spring of 2008, my wealthy entrepreneurial husband, Elon Musk, the father of my five young sons, filed for divorce. Six weeks later, he texted me to say he was engaged to a gorgeous British actress in her early 20s who had moved to Los Angeles to be with him. Her name is Talulah Riley, and she played one of the sisters in 2005's Pride and Prejudice. Two of the things that struck me were: a) Pride and Prejudice is a really good movie, and b) My life with this man had devolved to a cliché. 'Starter wife': Elon Musk's first wife and mother of his five sons Justine was very public about their acrimonious divorce . Musk describes in the interview her courtship and ensuing life with the famous mogul and the details range from sweet to downright creepy. As we danced at our wedding reception, Elon told me, 'I am the alpha in this relationship.' When she insisted she wasn't Elon's employee, Justine claimed her husband would say, 'If you were my employee, I would fire you.' As part of her extensive blogging regarding their divorce, Justine would come clean about her demands: . The house; alimony and child support; $6 million cash; 10 per cent of his stock in Tesla; 5 per cent of his stock in (ed: space transport company) SpaceX (and he retains all voting rights) and a Tesla Roadster (I really, really want one ...) Man of many talents: Musk founded Tesla Motors, an electric car company that had a $226 million initial public offering in 2010 . The two said they remain friends. Musk did not immediately Tweet news of the divorce Wednesday. Mr Musk, a South African who attended the University of Pennsylvania, made his fortune by founding a series of highly-successful ventures -- beginning with Zip2, which produced online content publishing software that was purchased in 1999 for nearly $340million. Later, for his next venture, Mr Musk helped create PayPal, the online money transfer and payment service. Ebay bought PayPal for $1.2billion in 2002. He founded Space X later that year -- a outer space exploration company. In 2009, the company launched the first privately-owned liquid-fueled rocket ever to enter space. Space X now has a contract to deliver cargo to the International Space Station that is worth between $1.6billion and $3.1billion. Mr Musk also founded Tesla Motors, an electric car company that had a $226million initial public offering in 2010. After his newest divorce from Talulah Riley, Musk will have shelled out around $20M to the British actress for their combined divorce agreements. But with a net worth around $1 billion, the futurist entrepreneur can stand to lose a few bucks .","California billionaire Musk and Riley were together for a year after they remarried, but they have lived apart the past five months .

"Etihad Airways are honouring tickets sold at hugely discounted rates by accident due to a computer glitch on Christmas Day. The airline inadvertently sold flights from New York to Abu Dhabi for prices as low as $187 (£120) – lowest prices in January are normally $444 (£285) - during a 20-hour period on December 25. News of the bargains spread like wildfire on social networking sites after they began to appear on comparison sites such as Kayak.com, TheFlightDeal, FlyerTalk, SlickDeals and Expedia. Etihad Airways are honouring flights sold on Christmas Day for as cheap as £120 for New York-Abu Dhabi . The flights appeared on comparison websites and news quickly travelled via social networking sites . Etihad has not revealed how many of the cut-price tickets were sold, but the majority went to tourists travelling from the United States for a winter sun break to the UAE. 'A system filing issue caused ticket prices for a promotion in the USA to be temporarily listed incorrectly,' Etihad spokeswoman Katie Connell said. 'The issue has since been rectified.' While Etihad have done the honourable thing in honouring the sales, US law demands they do this anyway even if it is clear an error was made. Many of the cheap flights sold have come from US tourists seeking a wintersun break in Abu Dhabi . However, after this recent event and others like it, the US Department of Transportation is considering an alteration of the rules due to the fast-moving nature of such events. 'We did it because it is the right thing,' Connell is quoted telling Forbes. 'We would have done it either way.'

"Deer hunters have stumbled across three skeletons in the remote mountains of eastern Oklahoma that are believed to be the remains of a family that has been missing since 2009. Bobby and Sherilyn Jamison vanished four years ago with their 6-year-old daughter Madyson while looking to buy mountain property in Latimer County, Oklahoma. After their disappearance in October 2009, a family pastor said the Jamisons had been involved in witchcraft. The Latimer County sheriff said he suspected they could have gotten into the drug trade. The remains were discovered Saturday in a hard-to-reach part of the Sansbois Mountains near Kinta, Oklahoma - about 155 miles east of Oklahoma City, the Oklahoman newspaper reports. Mystery: Sherilyn Jamison and daughter Madyson, 6, (pictured) vanished, along with father Bobby Jamison in October 2009 . Strange behavior: Friends and family members noticed a change in Bobby and Sherilyn Jamison's behavior before they vanished. They lost weight and were seen wandering around their home as if in a trance . Mystery: This is the Jamisons' pickup truck, which was found abandoned in the mountains eight days after the family was last seen . Medical examiners have not confirmed the identities of the victims, though the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation believes the remains likely belong to the Jamison family. The discovery was made not far from where the family's pickup truck was found in 2009 - eight days after they were last seen alive. Investigators found Mrs Jamison's purse, Mr Jamison's wallet, a cell phone, a GPS unit, a bank bag stuffed with $32,000 cash and the family dog - barely alive - in the cab of the truck at the time. The State Bureau of Investigation has not said whether there is any apparent trauma to the remains that would indicate what killed the family. The Jamison's disappearance unearthed a raft of strange behavior that friends and neighbors had teen the family exhibit. Remote: The skeletons were found in a remote area of the mountains in rural Oklahoma, about 155 miles east of Oklahoma City . Missing: Authorities at the time were especially fearful for little Madyson's safety - prompting a massive search effort with hundreds of volunteers. The family was never found . They lived in Eufaula, but had been looking to buy property 35 miles away in the mountains. At their home, investigators found a shipping container that had bizarre messages scrawled across it, including '3 cats killed to date buy people in this area … Witches don’t like there black cat killed' (sic). Their pastor, Gary Brandon, told detectives that the family had been involved in 'spiritual warfare.' Both Mr and Mrs Jamison had told him they had seen spirits at their Eufaula home. Mrs Jamison said the spirits of a long-dead family lived with them and that their daughter Madyson spoke with the youngest spirit. At one point, Mr Jamison asked his pastor whether he could obtain 'special bullets' to shoot the spirits. He later said he had consulted the 'satanic Bible' to find a cure to the spirits. Witchcraft: Both Mr and Mrs Jamison had talked about seeing 'spirits' at their home prior to their disappearance . Friends reported that the family had begun acting strangely and that both Mr and Mrs Jamison had lost a large amount of weight before they disappeared. The sheriff at the time concluded that the family had likely become involved in drugs - though no evidence of this was ever found. After they disappeared, a massive search effort was mobilized that included hundreds of volunteers, troopers from the Oklahoma State Highway Patrol and agents from both the FBI and the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation. Searchers combed the area on foot, on ATV and on horseback, but found nothing. Sixteen teams of dogs fanned out, but found nothing. Current Sheriff Jesse James said that the location of the skeletons could have been missed by rescuers are the family's bodies could have been covered in leaves that had fallen from the tree.","Bobby and Sherilyn Jamison and their daughter Madyson, 6, disappeared in October 2009 .

"A Brazilian man who was stabbed in the head at a house party drove more than two hours to hospital with a 30cm knife sticking out the side of his skull. Bleeding profusely from multiple stab wounds, Juacelo Nunes travelled 60 miles from the remote village of Agua Branca to the municipality of Teresina - both in northeastern Piaui state. Upon arriving at the hospital with the blade still embedded in his head, doctors discovered the 39-year-old had  severed nerves and veins in his face - injuries that could easily have proved fatal. But despite the serious nature of his injuries, the motorcycle taxi driver is expected to make a full recovery and is looking forward to spending tonight's New Year celebrations at home with his wife. Shocking: Upon arriving at the hospital with the blade still embedded in his head, doctors discovered 39-year-old Juacelo Nunes had severed nerves and veins in his face - injuries that could easily have proved fatal . Luck: Despite his serious injuries, motorcycle taxi driver Juacelo Nunes (pictured) is expected to make a full recovery and is looking forward to spending tonight's New Year celebrations at home with his wife . Mr Nunes was stabbed in the head after a fight broke out at a house party in Agua Branca at 4.30am on Sunday morning. Witnesses said he had got into a dispute with one man, who then called over three of his friends to carry out the attack, which also left Mr Nunes with stab wounds to his throat, shoulder and chest. As the four men battered Mr Nunes, at least one of them pulled out a knife and began stabbing him in the face and upper torso. The final blow saw a knife narrowly miss his left eye, pass through his mouth and embed itself in the right side of his upper jaw. Remarkably Mr Nunes did not lose consciousness at any point and was able to stagger away from his attackers into his vehicle. He then made the grueling two hour, 60 mile journey along jungle roads to hospital in Teresina. Once there he underwent three hours of emergency surgery to remove the blade. Location: Despite having a knife embedded in his skull, Mr Nunes made the grueling two hour, 60 mile journey along jungle roads from the village of Agua Branca to a hospital in the municipality of Teresina . 'The knife passed through several nerves and veins, structures that can quickly kill a patient' said Gilberto Albuquerque, the director of the hospital in Teresina, told Brazil's G1 news website. He added that the 39-year-old was recovering surprisingly well. Mr Nunes said that he cannot remember the exact moment the knife entered his head, but said that he knows he did not faint or lose consciousness at any point. 'I thought I would die and only came to believe when I saw what happened to me, because if someone told me I would not have believed it.' Mr Nunes' wife Francisca Pereira said she was shocked when she saw him with the knife in his skull, adding: 'I did not believe when I saw my husband like that... I thought he was going to die. It was a miracle.' The couple now plan to spend a quiet New Year's Eve at home with their family.","Juacelo Nunes was stabbed in the head at a party in Agua Branca village .

"An Australian actress has shared video of the panicked moment she fled from an AirAsia Zest flight that overshot the runway in the Philippines. Natalia Moon, 23, from Brisbane, recorded her dash for safety on her mobile phone as she escaped the Airbus A320-216, which landed at Kalibo Airport in Aklan province. 'Oh my god, oh my god,' the breathless actress said, shortly after darting down the jet's emergency slide. 'Holy crap. We just, we didn't even land on the runway.'

"HMRC has provoked fury after saying that people struggling to fill in their tax returns should publicly tweet their questions to get advice. Figures reveal that more than a third of calls to Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs are not answered. Some desperate callers are spending more than two hours on hold when contacting the jammed helplines to get advice on completing their self-assessment before the deadline at the end of this month. Margaret Hodge MP, pictured, described the suggestion that taxpayers should tweet the HMRC as 'laughable' New figures have shown that 2.4 million calls to the HMRC were not answered in September . The average time customers are left waiting on hold has more than doubled in the past year. MPs last night called for HMRC bosses to be brought before Parliament to explain themselves after it responded to the dismal waiting times by suggesting those who are unable to get through on the phone try using Twitter instead. They said it was ‘laughable’ to expect customers to sum up complicated tax questions in 140-character messages or to share them publicly. The latest figures show that 2.4million calls to the HMRC (34.5 per cent) were not answered in September, up from 1.2million calls (20.5 per cent) 12 months before. The average time callers with queries about tax had to wait has more than doubled in a year, rising to 11 minutes 51 seconds in September, up from 4 minutes 42 seconds a year earlier. Ten million individuals who self-assess have to submit their returns by January 31 with a £100 penalty for tax returns up to three months late. An HMRC spokesman last night admitted some customers ‘can struggle to get through on our helplines at very busy times’, but added ‘customers can get help with general self-assessment queries by tweeting us’. Shabana Mahmood MP, Labour’s exchequer spokesman, said: ‘It beggars belief that the Government’s response to taxpayers who can’t get through on their helpline is to urge them to publicly tweet about their tax affairs. ‘This is an unacceptable level of service to taxpayers and simply isn’t good enough.’ Margaret Hodge MP, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, called the tweet suggestion ‘laughable’, adding: ‘No customer based service should tolerate such a poor service and both ministers and senior management should simply sort this out.’ Mark Garnier MP, a member of the Treasury Select Committee, said: ‘Only a small proportion of the country uses Twitter. I cannot think of even a simple tax problem that can be summed up in 140 characters. It is just rubbish, naive, stupid and facile comment.’ Chancellor George Osborne has announced new powers for the HMRC to seize assets of tax dodgers . David Hickson of the Fair Telecoms Campaign said: ‘It is ridiculous and absolutely appalling situation and no surprise that people having to wait more than ten minutes are giving up trying. While tweets may be suited to some types of enquiry, it is unacceptable for telephone enquiry lines not to be adequately staffed.’ The blunder comes at a time when HMRC is requesting new powers to take unpaid taxes directly from taxpayers’ bank accounts. In the Budget, Chancellor George Osborne announced proposals to allow HMRC to seize assets from anyone who owes more than £1,000 in tax or tax credits, subject to certain safeguards. HMRC’s helplines have been beset with problems for several years. In November 2013 it introduced a voice-recognition system, which it said would help cut overall call times. But a Which? survey in December found the automated system is struggling with certain words and phrases. Last month HMRC scrapped all of its 0845 helpline telephone numbers, which charge premium rates to callers. The numbers have been replaced with alternatives starting 03, charged at a local rate. An HMRC spokesman said: ‘We are working hard to improve our handling of customer calls and are moving up to 1,500 extra people on to the phones during January as the self-assessment deadline approaches. ‘HMRC receives around 70million calls a year and we know that some of our customers can struggle to get through on our helplines at very busy times … customers can get help with general self-assessment queries by tweeting us.’","The HMRC failed to answer 2.4 million calls from taxpayers in September .

"An Argentine mediator filmed negotiating Top Gear's departure from Tierra del Fuego has branded Jeremy Clarkson a 'delinquent.' Former local government minister Mariano Plecity was secretly recorded meeting programme chiefs before they fled their hotel because of local anger over a number plate on Clarkson's Porsche. Clarkson and co-presenters James May and Richard Hammond staged a Butch Cassidy-style ending to their now-infamous south American special, screened in two parts at the weekend. Scroll down for video . Provocative: Jeremy Clarkson's Porsche pictured driving through Tierra del Fuego with the numberplate that appears to reference the 1982 Falklands war between Argentina and the United Kingdom . Yesterday Mr Plecity said the only similarity between the Top Gear presenters and notorious American train robber Cassidy, who fled Argentina after holding up a bank, was that they had 'run like delinquents.' He also denied Clarkson's claims in a newspaper column they had been 'ejected for political capital.' Mr Plecity, filmed meeting Top Gear security advisers at their hotel, told a Tierra del Fuego radio station: 'They ended the programme with a Butch Cassidy parody and it was real but only in that they left like delinquents. 'The idea they transmitted that they were forced to leave is untrue. They were invited to leave and they accepted that invitation.' 'Delinquent': Jeremy Clarkson was branded thus by local government minister Mariano Plecity, who also confirmed the Top Gear presenter left the area by plane, leaving technicians to drive out of the country . Confirming controversial Clarkson and his co-presenters left the southern city of Ushuaia by plane and were not with Top Gear technicians who were attacked by locals as they headed for Chile overland with a police escort, he added: 'Neither Jeremy Clarkson or the other two were in the convoy when it left the province. 'That was because the local government's primary concern was to save peoples' lives. 'We reserved 13 seats on an Aerolineas Argentinas flight which left Ushuaia for Buenos Aires at 7.30pm that same day with the three presenters and the production team. 'We made those reservations at their request after they accepted our invitation to leave the province and as soon as they decided they wanted to go. 'The local government never forced them to leave. They were invited to leave and decided to do so by plane because of the fear they were experiencing. 'Obviously the Malvinas issue is very important for Tierra del Fuego. It's something they've obviously evaluated in making their decision. 'The technicians were the only ones who left the area by land. They were about 15 to 20. There was no other option for them because they had all the equipment used for filming. 'We ordered the opening of a border pass to ensure there was no risk to their lives or wellbeing. 'While they were crossing, Jeremy Clarkson would have been nice and warm in Buenos Aires.' Legendary robbers: Butch Cassidy, right, and his ladies' man sidekick the Sundance Kid, left . Notorious American bank robber Butch Cassidy is thought to have carried out two heists in Argentina - including his biggest. He and his longtime partner in crime, Harry Longabaugh - aka the Sundance Kid - travelled from New York City to Buenos Aires in 1901. They settled on a 15,0000-acre ranch in the country's southern Chubut province, presumably bought with the ill-gotten gains from their criminal activities in the U.S. - but by 1905 they were at it again. On Valentine's Day that year two English-speaking bandits, thought to be Cassidy and Longabaugh, held up the Banco de Tarapacá y Argentino in Río Gallegos, 700 miles south of Cholila. Escaping with a sum that would be worth at least U.S. $100,000 today, the pair vanished north across the bleak Patagonian steppes. Shortly after they sold the Cholila rance and fled to Chile. But by the end of the year they were back in Argentina, raiding the the Banco de la Nación branch in Villa Mercedes, 400 miles west of Buenos Aires, taking 12,000 pesos. Pursued by armed lawmen, they crossed the Pampas and the Andes and again reached the safety of Chile. The story of Cassidy and the Sundance Kid was made into a 1972 film starring Robert Redford and Paul Newman. Mr Plecity, Secretary of Institutional Affairs during Top Gear's Tierra del Fuego scare, also accused the BBC of making it appear local police were harassing rather than protecting Jeremy and his colleagues from angry locals because it made 'good TV.' He told Radio Fuegina: 'The operative to get them to safety was very good. It worked very well. Locals were furious at what they considered was a provocation with the number plate and we ensured there was no loss of life.' Of the Top Gear team's decision to abandon Clarkson's Porsche near a town where they were stoned by demonstrators, along with James May's Lotus and Richard Hammond's Mustang, he added: 'My personal opinion is that they left them as part of a show to be able to put into their programme. 'It was another image they had that they could include.' The Top Gear team, featuring Richard Hammond, Jeremy Clarkson and James May, were in Argentina as part of their mission to reach the bottom of South America in V8 sports cars and build a 'stadium' from containers . Footage captured on camera phones will show the convoy coming under attack from irate locals in Tolhuin . Clarkson upset Falklands War veterans in southern Argentina by driving through the country in a Porsche with the number plate H982 FKL. Despite denials, many observers still think the incident was a publicity stunt. Here’s why: . The 54-year-old and his co-presenters were taking part in a 1,400-mile filmed trek along Argentina's famous Patagonian Highway. The trio cut short their trip and took an unscheduled flight out of Ushuaia on October 2 while leaving other members of their team to face an angry mob as they tried to escape Argentina by crossing to Chile with a police escort. James May's Lotus car, Richard Hammond's Ford Mustang and the Porsche driven by Clarkson are currently being stored in a customs' building in Rio Grande near Ushuaia while officials decide what to do with them. Clarkson told in his Sunday Times column after returning to Britain how protestors 'bayed for his blood' as they stormed the hotel in Ushuaia where the Top Gear team was staying. He claimed he was the victim of an orchestrated government campaign and had to hide under his hotel bed following an ultimatum to leave Argentina as an armed mob warned: 'This is a mafia state, best you do as you're told.' The BBC screened its two-part south American trek despite protests from the Argentine government. Alicia Castro, Argentina's ambassador to the UK, called the H982 plate 'malicious mockery' of those who fought in the 1982 Falklands War in a letter to BBC trust chairman Rona Fairhead earlier this month.","Mariano Plecity helped them get flights to Chile after they angered locals .

"A 25-year-old woman from London was today arrested on suspicion of Syria-related terror offences. She was detained at Luton Airport in Bedfordshire by detectives from the West Midlands counter-terrorism unit as she left a flight that had returned to the UK from Istanbul. The woman from Haringey, north London, was arrested as part of a continuing intelligence-led policing operation. Arrest: Detectives from the West Midlands counter-terrorism unit detained the woman at Luton Airport (above) in Bedfordshire on suspicion of Syria-related terror offences . She was being held this afternoon at a police station in the West Midlands on suspicion of preparing for acts of terrorism. The terror threat level in the UK was raised from substantial to severe earlier this year against a backdrop of increasing concerns over hundreds of aspiring British jihadis travelling to Iraq and Syria to learn terrorist ‘tradecraft’. Fears of a terrorist attack on Britain's streets have heightened in the wake of Islamic State's rise. The extremist group, also known as ISIS, has taken over large swathes of Iraq and Syria and attracted thousands of foreign jihadists to its cause, including more than 500 Britons. A new Counter-terrorism and Security Bill, containing a range of draconian powers including new orders that can block suspected British fighters from returning to the UK, was introduced to Parliament this year. Concern: Fears of a terrorist attack on Britain's streets have heightened in the wake of the rise of extremist group Islamic State (file picture) Separately today, it was reported that the number of arrests in terrorism investigations in Britain had jumped by 40 per cent this year. Police had arrested 312 people for various terrorist offences as of December 16, 2014, compared with 222 offences in 2013, according to data from the Metropolitan Police and Home Office. In addition, detectives in London said they had been contacted by 39 families this year with concerns that a relative may be planning to travel to fight in Syria, reported Bloomberg. Last month a man aged 20 and a woman, 19, from Walsall were detained at London Heathrow Airport on suspicion of Syria-related terrorism offences as they disembarked a flight from Istanbul. Also last month, a 19-year-old man from Coventry was held by counter-terrorism officers at the same airport after arriving on a flight from Jordan. But earlier this year, London Mayor Boris Johnson was roundly criticised after calling for British citizens travelling to Iraq and Syria to be stripped of their passports automatically.

"Lenny Henry received mixed reviews when he guest edited BBC Radio 4's Today Programme . Comedian Lenny Henry has said work has 'simply dried up' for black, Asian and minority ethnic actors  in the UK. He said that 'colour-blind casting' has not caught on in the UK and the likes of Idris Elba, who has been touted as the next James Bond and actress Thandie Newton are not getting the job offers they should. Henry made the comments after he guest-edited BBC Radio 4's Today programme, when the on-air line-up was altered to ensure every member of the team was from black or ethnic minority background. The comedian told The Guardian: 'Whereas I have only dipped my toe into news, I know much more about another part of the creative industries - acting. 'And here in the UK, work has simply dried up for Bame actors. 'People such as David Oyelowo, Idris Elba, Thandie Newton, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Cush Jumbo aren't getting the offers one might expect. 'Colour-blind casting hasn't quite caught on in the UK, so jobs in high-end drama are dribbling away."" In yesterday's programme, regular presenter Mishal Husain was joined by Nkem Ifejika, with Reeta Chakrabarti reading the news, and Jay Wynne presenting the weather. Linda Yueh was handling the business news while Karthi Gnanasegaram presented the sport. Henry challenged Culture Secretary Sajid Javid on whether the next BBC charter should include minimum targets for diversity among staff and on-screen talent, but agreed with the Cabinet minister that simple quotas would be ineffective. While some people supported the programme calling it 'refreshing' others criticised it for not being diverse enough. Broadcaster Jeremy Vine was quick to come out in support of the show calling it 'thought-provoking.' Bethany Skinnard tweeted: 'Really enjoyed your guest edit@LennyHenry on @BBCRadio4 #todayshow really refreshing perspective and let's not forget # devilsavocado' Scroll down for video . The presenting line-up for the Today Programme guest edited by Lenny Henry, included Nkem Ifejika and Mishal Husain . However, others described the decision to exclude white presenters as 'positive race discrimination' and described Henry as a 'hypocrite.' Steve Speck tweeted: 'R4 Today Prog - prime example of positive race discrimination. Lenny Henry insisted all presenters from ethnic minorities. #bbcr4today' During the show Henry revealed that he had been the victim of racism his 'whole life.' He said that included during the programme and  after he made earlier in the year to BAFTA about the lack of black and ethnic minority people on screen. 'I'm very aware there's still a way to go,' he said. 'But what's great is there's a tolerance in this country that is extraordinary and to be proud of and I'm proud to be British and my mum was proud to be British too.'","Comedian Lenny Henry has said work has 'dried up' for BAME actors .

"A fugitive who escaped from an Idaho jail in August is now taunting cops from the beautiful beaches of Cancun, Mexico, authorities believe. Nick Grove, who was doing time for burglary and firearms possession, hopped the razor wire-topped fence at the Payette County Jail on August 26 and fled. The 27-year-old surfaced on social media about a month later - posing frequent updates on Facebook and even chatting with a local TV reporter. Wish you weren't here: Nick Grove, who escaped from jail in Idaho in August, is now posting photos like these publicly on his Facebook profile - taunting cops . Grove openly declares that he is in Cancun, Mexico, on his Facebook profile and posts pictures such as this one showing his location . At the time, he used software to mask his location online and where he was logging in from. Now, he's revealed his new digs - and he's rubbing it in cops faces. The Ontario, Oregon, native's Facebook page reveals that he lives in Cancun. He has posted numerous photos of himself relaxing on the beach. One shows him shirtless, toes on the sand, defiantly waving his middle finger at the camera. He has also posted several intimate pictures with women - proving that he's enjoying his time as a free man. But authorities back in Idaho have said Grove shouldn't be too smug - they haven't given up trying to throw him back behind bars. Grove (pictured left in his mug shot) has posted several photos of himself with women since escaping jail . Gove hopped the razor-wire-topped fence at the jail and darted to freedom in August. He has not been seen since . They have contacted Facebook to attempted to track down his location and have also alerted the US Marshals service and local authorities in Cancun, Mexico. Authorities said they believe Grove's family are helping him to settle in Mexico. KTVB reported in September, one month after Grove's escape, that he had already forged a new life and a new identity - and even got a job and was working again. 'This is my element. Within four days I had a new life, new ID, new face, new job,' he told the TV station.","Nick Grove escaped from the Payette County Jail on August 26 .

"A rare red and grey bird whose plumage is split into two halves has been found to be half female and half male that does not sing. The unusual northern cardinal was first spotted in Rock Island, Illinois in 2008 and has excited ornithologists for years. Now scientists who have been studying the bird say it is an example of a a condition known as bilateral gynandromorphism. The split-sex northern cardinal has bright red male plumage on its left and drab female feathers on its right . This means that it is a split-sex bird, with the bright red colour of male northern cardinal on its left side and the brownish grey of the female on its right. This occurs when the sex chromosomes in its cells are split unevenly during very early development after the egg is fertilised. However, despite its striking plumage, the split-sex bird has a rather lonely life, according to the researchers from Western Illinois University who have been following the birds movements. They said that it never managed to find a mate nor was it ever heard to sing or call. However, it was also not persecuted by other cardinals and instead seemed to be largely ignored. Male northern cardinals usually have bright red plumage (left) while females are a drab grey or brown (right) Professor Brian Peer, a behavioural ecologist who led the study, said: 'The bird exhibited the typical bright red color of a male cardinal on the left half of its body, and the dull brownish-gray appearance of a female cardinal on the right half. 'We observed the bird more than 40 days, mostly in the vicinity of bird feeders. 'It was never paired with another cardinal, was never heard vocalizing, and was not subjected to any unusual agonistic behaviors from other cardinals. 'These observations are among the most extensive of any bilateral gynandromorph bird in the wild.' Male northern cardinals (above) usually mark out their territory with whistled songs but the split-sex bird was not found to make any vocalisations during the period that the scientists were studying the animal . Gynandromorphs most commonly exist among insects such as butterflies but are also known to occur in birds and crustaceans. However, few scientists get to study them in detail in the wild. Northern Cardinals so called due to the bright red plumage that the males develop, which are said to resemble the scarlet vestments worn warn by Catholic Cardinals. They tend to be found in woodlands and gardens in the eastern United States and Mexico. Measuring up to 8.3 inches, it mainly feeds on insects and fruits. The male birds usually mark out their territory by singing and will court females by feeding them seeds from their beak. Their song tends to be a loud clear whistle that are repeated several times while cardinal pairs also use a chipping noise to locate each other. It is not clear why the split-sex northern cardinal did not make any vocalisations but it may be partly why it tended to be shunned by other birds. The bird is thought to have both testes and ovaries. Professor Peer added that the bird did not appear to be suffering any ill affects as a result of its condition. He sad: 'Other than it's unusual appearance, the fact that it was never paired with another bird, and it didn't vocalize, it appeared relatively ""normal"", if that can be said about this bird. 'Both male and female cardinals vocalize and sing, so it's not clear why this bird did not sing. The degree of symmetry in our bird was striking, even through the crest on the top of the bird's head.' It is the second time a gynandromorph cardinal has been sighted, with one in 1969 reported to have the opposite plumage with the male's bright red colouring on the right and the drabber female feathers on the left.","The half red and half grey bird suffers from bilateral gynandromorphism .

"Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei waded into the race debate in the U.S. over the holidays, aligning the cop killings in New York and Ferguson with troubles in the Middle East. Khamenei posted a series of tweets over the past week. He used hashtags which sprung up following the shooting of unarmed black teen Michael Brown and the chokehold death of Eric Garner including #BlackLivesMatter and #Ferguson. On Sunday, the leader tweeted: 'It's expected that followers of #Jesus follow him in his fight against arrogants and in his support for the oppressed. #BlackLivesMatter.' Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei weighed in on America's current race crisis via his Twitter account on Sunday with the widely-used hashtag '#BlackLivesMatter' Khamenei, a Shia cleric who leads Iran in matters of religion and politics, is known for his hardline attitude towards the U.S. He also wrote: '#Jesus endured sufferings to oppose tyrants who had put humans in hell in this world& the hereafter while he backed the oppressed. #Ferguson.' Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old, was shot dead by a white cop in Ferguson, Missouri on August 9. Eric Garner, a 43-year-old, father-of-six died after being placed in a chokehold by a NYPD officer on July 17 on Staten Island. On December 24, CNN reported, the Supreme Leader compared the plight of Gaza with protests in Ferguson. He wrote: ""#Jesus like all prophets was herald of monotheism& human dignity; nowadays humanity needs this message more than ever.#Ferguson #Gaza 1/1/93.'

"It may look like a model-makers dream, but this collection of components will travel at more than 1,000 mph when put together. This is how the Bloodhound Supersonic Car when broken down into its 3,500 components. It includes a state of the art Rolls-Royce EJ200 jet engine that is normally used in a Eurofighter Typhoon, Nammo hybrid rockets and its titanium skinned chassis. Scroll down for video showing what all the components are . Engineers will piece together 3,500 components to build the Bloodhound Supersonic Car ahead of its attempt to break the world land speed record and to be the first land vehicle to go faster than 1,000 mph (1,600km/h) The Rolls Royce jet engine generates 135,000 horsepower - the equivalent to 180 Formula 1 cars. It needs a 550bhp Supercharged Jaguar V8 engine to pump the fuel into the rocket. The team behind the Bloodhound SSC also revealed how they intend to slow it from 1,000mph (1,600km/h) to zero. After the car reaches its top speed, air brakes and parachutes slow it to 160mph (260km/h). Breaking to this speed is done at a constant 3G deceleration - equivalent to going from 60mph (95km/h) in a normal car to zero in just one second - for 20 seconds. At this speed the cars wheels are still spinning 10,000 times per minute. Attempts to use carbon rotors from a jet fighter in the form of car-like disc brakes shattered at speeds of just half this, so the team needed a new approach. Instead, they switched to steel rotors. In tests, these could withstand temperatures of up to 850°C (1,560°F), and be used again. The next step will be to test these brakes out at the full 10,000rpm that will be experienced. The carbon fibre and titanium chassis and canopy will be fitted together using 22,500 aerospace grade rivets, which are fixed by hand by the teams engineers. However, at £10 million the rocket-powered vehicle is probably a little out the price range of most model car enthusiasts. In 2016 driver RAF fighter pilot Andy Green will travel with the vehicle to the desert of the Hakskeen Pan in north west South Africa where they will attempt to break the 1,000mph (1,600km/h) barrier. Wing Commander Green currently holds the land speed record of 763mph (1,223km/h) in the Trust Supersonic Car. A spokesman for the Bloodhound project said they were confident of breaking this record and going faster than 1,000mph for the first time on land. The project has been seven years in the making and has been a dream of former RAF pilot Andy Green since he set the current record in 1997. The spokesman said: 'The Bloodhound Supersonic Car kit contains over 3,500 components, many custom-made. 'One hundred and ten man-years have been invested in the design, build and manufacture of the Bloodhound SSC which is on track to challenge the Land Speed Record later this year in the Kalahari Desert, South Africa.' During the record-chasing run in South Africa, Bloodhound (pictured) will cover 12 miles (19km) in two minutes, exerting an acceleration force of almost 2G, and peak deceleration force of 3G on the driver . Earlier this month the Bloodhound team's rocket partner Nammo carried out tests on the first of three large hybrid rocket motors that will be included in the vehicle. Initially Bloodhound will use one Nammo hybrid rocket in high speed testing scheduled for 2015 and a cluster of three rockets in its 1,000mph campaign in 2016. This is addition to main the main engine, which is normally found powering a Eurofighter Typhoon, weighs a tonne and produces 20,000lbs (90kN) - or nine tonnes of thrust. The two power plants together produce 135,000 thrust horse power, or the equivalent to 180 Formula 1 cars. Earlier this year, designers of the supersonic car revealed the vehicle’s futuristic cockpit. It has been made from five different types of carbon fibre weave, and two different resins. It has taken more than 10,000 hours to design and manufacture in total. Sandwiched between the layers of carbon fibre are three different thicknesses of aluminium honeycomb core, which provide additional strength. At its thickest point the material is made up of 13 layers, but measures just 0.9-inches (24mm) thick. Bloodhound will have to withstand extreme forces, including the risk of bird strike, during its record attempt . The components for Bloodhound include solid aluminium wheels for running over the desert surface (6), a 3D printed titanium steering wheel (18), the cockpit canopy (29), ice tanks (33) for cooling the V8 engine (15) carbon fibre fuel tanks (27), the Rolls-Royce EJ200 jet engine (14) and driver Andy Green (17) The cockpit structure weighs 441lbs (200kg) and bolts directly to the metallic rear chassis carrying the jet, rocket and racing car engine. It has to be strong as this front section will have to endure peak aerodynamic loads of up to three tonnes per square metre at 1,000mph (1,609kph), as well the considerable forces generated by the front wheels and suspension. It will also carry ballistic armour to protect Wing Commander Green should a stone be thrown up by the front wheels at very high speeds. Bloodhound will attempt to beat the World Land Speed Record set by the Thrust Supersonic Car in 1997 . The cockpit is positioned in front of three loud motors - the jet, a cluster of hybrid rockets and the racing car engine that drives the rocket’s oxidiser pump, which are expected to generate a noise level estimated at 140 decibels - the equivalent to a shotgun blast. Wing Commander Green will wear a specially made in-ear communications system to protect his hearing and to ensure that he can communicate with mission control. Mark Chapman, chief engineer behind Bloodhound: 'This is a fantastic moment in the project, it is great to see the car broken down into its main components. “It validates the many years of hard work by our team of motorsport and aerospace engineers.” The SSC stands for ‘SuperSonic Car’. The vehicle has four wheels and is powered by both the newly-fitted jet engine and a rocket. It is set to travel at 1,000mph (1,600km/h). The slender body, 44 feet (14 metres) long, keeps the entire vehicle aerodynamic. The pencil-shaped car (concept pictured) will be 44ft (13.4m) long and weigh 7.5 tonnes when completed . It weighs just over seven tonnes and the engines will produce more than 135,000 horsepower. That’s more than six times the power of all the cars on a Formula 1 starting grid put together. In the coming years the vehicle will begin test runs at lower speeds before attempting to set a new land speed record. The current land speed record stands at 763.035mph (1,227.985km/h), set by former RAF pilot Andy Green - who will also drive the Bloodhound - back in 1997 in the ThrustSSC.","The Bloodhound SSC is designed to faster than 1,000mph (1,600km/h)

"For most of us, one heart will last a lifetime. Summer Carss, however, is on her third – and she has only just turned four. The youngster has had two transplant operations after being born with a heart that did not work properly. The most recent operation took place 12 months ago and so far it has been a case of third time lucky. The organ seems to be working well and, much to the relief of her parents, Summer is now living life to the full. 'so inspirational': Four-year-old Summer Carss has had two heart transplant operations after being born with an organ that did not work properly . Third time lucky: Summer Carss, pictured with her parents Julie and Paul, underwent the most recent transplant 12 months ago and it seems to be working well . It is extremely rare for such a young child to have had two heart transplants and she could even be the youngest ever. Her mother Julie Carss, 31, a former nursery nurse, said: ‘Summer is an amazing little girl. Nothing scares her and that is what has helped get her through. ‘This time last year we were at her bedside. When we look back it’s hard to think that we got through it, but we’re quite positive people and hopefully that rubbed off on our daughter.’ At three months old Summer, from Alnwick, Northumberland, was diagnosed with aortic stenosis, a condition which means the valve on the left side of her heart does not open properly. She had two heart operations to tackle the problem, but when she was about a year old she got a cold which developed into pneumonia. In January 2012 she had a cardiac arrest and was admitted to intensive care at Newcastle’s Freeman Hospital. She went to the top of the transplant list, but had to wait nine months for a suitable heart to become available. Summer pictured in hospital while she was waiting for her heart transplant . Mrs Carss said: ‘It was horrendous waiting for a heart as you pray for the day that you get the call to say one has become available. ‘But at the back of your mind you’re always thinking about the other family as you know someone has had to say goodbye to their child. We are so grateful to the donors and their families.’ The transplant was a success. However, a year later the family were given the devastating news that scans had revealed coronary artery disease. ‘It was a shock to be told Summer needed another heart transplant and we’d have to go through it all again,’ said Mrs Carss. This time it took three months for a donor organ to be found before she could be given a transplant. Mrs Carss and her husband Paul, 37, a warehouse worker, hope their traumas are now behind them. ‘It has been a difficult few years but we’ve got to the end of the rocky road,’ said Mrs Carss. ‘We have a beautiful little girl who is so inspirational. Twice we thought we were going to lose Summer and we know of people whose child has not made it to the first heart transplant so we’re very lucky that our daughter has had two.’ Lynne Holt, transplant co-ordinator at the Freeman Hospital, said: ‘It is very unusual for a child to have two heart transplants.’","Summer Carss, four, has undergone two heart transplants since being born .

"The Co-operative said sales of its own-brand prosecco were up 60 per cent in week before Christmas and expects to sell three a second today . Sales of prosecco have soared ahead of New Year's Eve celebrations, with one retailer expecting to sell three bottles every second. The Co-operative said  sales of its own brand prosecco were up 60 per cent in the week before Christmas and it anticipated selling three bottles every second that it is open today - up from two bottles a second on Christmas Eve. It saw bottles of prosecco outsell milk, the usual best-seller, in the lead-up to Christmas. The Co-operative Food customer director, Andrew Mann, said: 'As a leading convenience retailer we've seen a shift in consumer habits and prosecco has fast become the nation's favourite drink with which to mark an occasion or celebrate. 'Over the last few days it has even outsold milk.' Marks & Spencer said sales of prosecco were up 45 per cent on this time last year and it had sold 1.6 million bottles over the last 12 months, up from 1.1 million last year. M&S wine buyer Dror Nativ said: 'The ongoing prosecco boom has of course been fuelled by the affordability and approachability of this wine, but what is most interesting is the new trend for enjoying prosecco as an everyday drink rather than solely on celebratory occasions. 'Our customers are enjoying prosecco midweek, at dinner parties with friends or simply as a treat, and sales show no sign of slowing down.' Tesco has announced that its prosecco sales are up 50 per cent this year and Waitrose has reported an annual increase of 58 per cent. Earlier this month wine merchant Laithwaite's predicted prosecco would comfortably outsell Champagne again this Christmas. Laithwaite's UK managing director David Thatcher said: 'We have a good picture of the nation's habits and prosecco is already outselling Champagne this year.' Waitrose said prosecco continued to be the 'fizz of choice' to bring in the New Year, outselling champagne by 1.7 bottles to one. Waitrose head of wine, beer and spirits-buying Pierpaolo Petrassi said: 'We know that our customers' love for prosecco shows no sign of abating.' Both Waitrose and Marks & Spencer have reported increases in the sales of their own brand Prosecco . The deliciously bubbly Plaza Centro prosecco is now just £6.49 reduced from £12.99 in Tesco . 1.

"A woman has launched a campaign for U.S. airlines to allow hedgehogs to travel in airplane cabins, after learning that her prickly friend could not travel with her by air. Zoe Herman was shocked to discover that Heloise the hedgehog could only board a flight if she was stowed in the airplane's cargo hold - something she says is just not safe for the delicate little animal. So now Zoe, from Portland, Oregon, is going up against some of America's biggest airlines with a petition to allow the prickly creatures to travel  in the cabin, just like small cats and dogs. Heloise the hedgehog, from Portland, is not allowed to travel inside airplane cabins aongside her owner . Zoe first discovered that airplane cabin's were a no-go for hedgehogs when she booked a flight across the States to visit her family for the holidays. She quickly learned that most, if not all U.S. airlines, refuse to allow hedgehogs to travel in airplanes, and only a handful allow the prickly animals in cargo-holds. 'They all said they were a danger of chewing out of their cages, which if you know anything about hedgehogs, they can't do that,' Zoe told KATU News. 'They don't have teeth that chew. They just kind of tear apart meat, that's it.' Zoe Herman (pictured) is going up against some of America's biggest airlines with a petition to allow her companion hedgehog Heloise to travel in the cabin, just like small cats and dogs. Zoe's petition is directed at American Airlines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines, which she says harbor numerous misconceptions about hedgehogs. On her campaign page, Zoe writes: 'Hedgehogs are very clean animals, and because they do not have fur, they have little to no dander. Unlike cats and dogs, it is uncommon to be allergic to a hedgehog.' She also points out that hedgehogs do not make any noise, 'other than the occasional sneeze or itch'. Zoe says Heloise is clean and quiet, so traveling with her in an airplane cabin should not be a problem at all . 'They do not bark, meow, whine, growl, hiss, or scratch at their cages, as cats and dogs may do, Zoe adds. 'In fact, hedgehogs sleep most of the time, meaning that traveling with a hedgehog is essentially like traveling with a very small, spiny stuffed animal.' Hedgehogs, affectionately known as 'hedgies' by their fans, are an increasingly popular pet in the United States. However, they are actually illegal in some cities and states, including New York City, California, Arizona, Georgia, Hawaii, and Maine.

"Britain is paying millions into a scheme branded an 'EU propaganda fund' by MPs, MailOnline can reveal. UK taxpayers are committed to paying £18million into a controversial scheme called the Europe for Citizens programme over the next six years - despite it paying just £300,000 back to Britain this year. The fund - set up to nurture feelings of 'European Citizenship' - has been criticised  for handing out generous grants to pro-European groups in an apparent bid to strengthen its own power. But figures show that British organisations were handed just 2.5 per cent of the £10million the fund gave to  schemes in  other member states across the continent this year. A scheme run by the European Commission (pictured) is awarding British organisations just a tiny fraction of the money UK taxpayers put in to the scheme, dubbed an 'EU propaganda fund' by some MPs . The UK gets just a tiny fraction of the funding despite British taxpayers paying roughly 10 per cent of the scheme's £185million six-year budget - contributing around £3million every year. The fund  handed out £3.3million to 33 different organisations in European countries this year as part of its 'network of towns' scheme - but not one British group was given money. By contrast, Italian organisations  received eight separate grants totalling nearly £1million for schemes which organisers claim 'allow towns to work together in a common theme'. Brussels bosses also handed out a further £2.2million to 188 local councils and organisations around Europe this summer for town twinning programmes - but no British schemes were given funding. Hungarian towns by contrast were given 41 separate grants, each of about 25,000 euros, while more than 15 Romanian towns were given money, along with 11 Italian projects. Tory MP Chris Heaton-Harris has called for the entire scheme to be scrapped so that Britain can spend the money it contributes domestically . Only in the second tranche of funding, announced in September, did Britain finally get a share of the huge funding pot. Then, just two out of the 60 twinning projects given funding, those involving Cardiff and Aberdeen, were helped, receiving 12,500 euros (around £10,000). A further 10 Hungarian towns were given generous grants - meaning more than 50 organisations in that country alone cashed in. In total, British authorities have received just £10,000 of the £6.3million handed out by the twinning and 'network' schemes, figures published on the EU's website reveal. The descriptions of the organisations given funding are often unclear on the programme's website. A Spanish plan which was handed around £100,000 boasts that its scheme will move 'towards European policies and best practices for supporting local governance multi-level application'. Meanwhile, an Italian scheme which was given £120,000 claims it wants to 'create a European network of bio-districts to achieve a true territorial renaissance'. In another strand of funding, around £2.6million was given to 30 'Civil Society' projects, which organisers claim 'gather citizens in activities directly linked to EU policies'. In this area, only one British organisation, the charity Citizens UK, received any money and was given £120,000. Two British organisations were also given £80,000 grants as part of the £2.2million handed out for remembrance ceremonies and events during the centenary of the start of the First World War. Chris Heaton-Harris, who voiced fears that too much money was only going to pro-European organisations earlier this year, called for the fund to be scrapped. He told MailOnline: 'The vast majority of projects this money is being given to and the sort of people who are given money are people who produce EU propaganda.' While only two British cities got money from the scheme, authorities in Hungary (whose capital Budapest is pictured) received more than 50 separate grants - most of which were between £10,000 and £15,000 . He added: 'I didn't like the scheme in the first place. The only part of it that I do approve of is the part that gives money for holocaust and war remembrance. 'I think the whole Europe for Citizens programme should be canned and we should use the money domestically for  for  holocaust and World War remembrance.' It comes after Brussels demanded a £1.7billion 'surcharge' to the £11billion-a-year Britain already pays into the EU budget. The UK government later claimed the extra bill had been cut to £850million and would be paid in instalments next year. The European Commission has backed the scheme, insisting it 'contributes by developing citizens' organisations' capacity to engage citizens in the democratic life of the Union'. A statement on their website states: 'Europe has a challenging agenda for the next seven years, with serious issues at stake. 'With decisions and policies needed on issues ranging from economic growth, security and Europe’s role in the world, it is now more important than ever for citizens to take part in discussions and help shape policies.'

"Nearly a third of British tourists will travel to India without insurance, even though it one of the long-haul destinations where they are most likely to run into problems. Twenty-nine per cent of Britons will fail to take out insurance for India trips, while 18 per cent of travellers have reported difficulties in the country over the last five years. Also, 23 per cent of Britons had problems in Sri Lanka, but 21 per cent failed to get themselves insured, the survey by Post Office Travel Insurance found. Nearly a third of British tourists will travel to India without travel insurance to protect them . Another country where more than 20 per cent had problems and for which more than 20 per cent were not insured was Mauritius, while 15 per cent had problems in South Africa yet 19 per cent were uninsured. Based on responses from more than 1,000 Britons who had taken a long-haul holiday over the last five years, the problems encountered covered mainly illness, injury, travel delays and theft. Sri Lanka was the country where the most people had run into difficulties, followed by Mauritius, India and South Africa. In contrast, only 6 per cent had had problems in the USA and only 5 per cent in Canada. Fewer holidaymakers visiting the Caribbean and Egypt encountered problems that might lead to an insurance claim. At the same time, only nine per cent of Caribbean tourists failed to take out travel insurance while 11 per cent travelled to Egypt without cover. The survey also showed that it was those in the 18-34 age range who were the least likely to take out travel insurance, with a third saying they had travelled uncovered on their last long-haul trip. This compared with a figure of only 6 per cent for those aged 55 and over. India is also one of the destinations where the highest number of Britons has experienced problems . A fifth of holidaymakers to Mauritius will also experience problems during their trip . For those who were insured and went on to make a claim, the biggest single reason was illness that required medical treatment (35 per cent). Almost as many (31 per cent) needed treatment for accidental injury. Around 20 per cent needed treatment for an injury caused by sports activity, 15 per cent had to be repatriated to the UK because of illness and 15 per cent needed transporting by air ambulance - one of the most expensive claim items. Although the average cost overall of a long-haul holiday insurance claim was £4,859, the price can escalate for individual destinations. Post Office Travel Insurance said claims data for India revealed that an air ambulance to the UK could cost £80,000 to £100,000, while surgery for a broken leg could cost £12,000 and treatment for gastro-enteritis could be priced between £2,000 and £4,000. Post Office head of insurance Paul Havenhand said: 'It is worrying that the countries where holidaymakers are most likely to travel without insurance are also ones where our research found that more problems occurred that might lead to medical treatment or loss of valuable belongings. 'If you are planning a winter sun trip to an exotic destination, it is vital to ensure you are comprehensively covered to ensure that you have peace of mind when travelling far away from home. Avoid cheap travel insurance deals that could leave you exposed when problems occur.'","India is the long-haul destinations most Britons travel to without insurance .

"The UN Security Council has rejected a resolution to the Israel-Palestine conflict calling for an Israeli withdrawal from occupied areas and the establishment of a Palestinian state by late 2017. The resolution had been put forward by Palestine and was rebuffed by the council on Tuesday after it failed to receive the minimum nine votes. The draft called for negotiations to be based on . territorial lines that existed before Israel captured the West . Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Middle East . war. It also called for a peace deal within 12 months. Scroll down for video . Conflict: Mourners carry the body of Palestinian Imam Dwikat, who was shot dead by Israeli troops on Monday, during his funeral in the West Bank village of Baita near City of Nablus, Tuesday, Dec. 30, 2014 . Even if the proposal had received the minimum nine votes in . favor, it would have been defeated by Washington's vote against . it. The United States is one of the five veto-wielding permanent . members. There were eight votes in favor, including France, Russia . and China, two against and five abstentions, among them Britain. Australia joined the United States in voting against the . measure. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power . defended Washington's position against the draft in a speech to . the 15-nation council by saying it was not a vote against peace . between Israel and the Palestinians. 'The United States every day searches for new ways to take . constructive steps to support the parties in making progress . toward achieving a negotiated settlement,' she said. 'The . Security Council resolution put before us today is not one of . those constructive steps.' The UN Security Council rejected the resolution brought by Palestine, which called for establishment of a Palestinian state by late 2017 and Israeli withdrawal from occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem . Critique: Samantha Power, the United States' ambassador to the United Nations said the resolution was not a constructive step towards peace . She said the text was 'deeply imbalanced' and contained . 'unconstructive deadlines that take no account of Israel's . legitimate security concerns.' To make matters worse, Power . said, it 'was put to a vote without a discussion or due . consideration among council members.' She did not spare Israel either. 'Today's vote should not be . interpreted as a victory for an unsustainable status quo,' Power . said, adding that Washington would oppose actions by either side . that undermined peace efforts, whether 'in the form of . settlement activity or imbalanced draft resolutions.' Jordanian Ambassador Dina Kawar, the sole Arab . representative on the council, expressed regret that the . resolution was voted down, while noting that she thought council . members should have had more time to discuss the proposal. The defeat of the resolution was not surprising. Washington, . council diplomats said, had made clear it did not want such a . resolution put to a vote before Israel's election in March. The Palestinians, the diplomats said, insisted on putting . the resolution to a vote despite the fact that it was clear . Washington would not let it pass. Their sudden announcement last . weekend that Ramallah wanted a vote before the new year . surprised Western delegations on the council. In order to pass, a resolution needs nine votes in favor and . no vetoes from the council's five permanent members. The European and African camps were split in the vote. France and Luxembourg voted in favor of the resolution while . Britain and Lithuania abstained. Among the Africans, Chad voted . yes while Rwanda and Nigeria abstained. The Palestinians, frustrated by the lack of progress in . peace talks, have sought to internationalize the issue by . seeking U.N. membership and recognition of statehood via . membership in international organizations. Palestinian observer Riyad Mansour thanked delegations that . voted for the resolution, noting that lawmakers in a number of . European countries have called for recognition of Palestine. He . said it was time to end the 'abhorrent Israeli occupation and . impunity that has brought our people so much suffering.' Tension: Israeli security forces use tear gas during a protest against a Jewish settlement construction at Bilin Village, in Ramallah, West Bank on Boxing Day . 'It is thus most regrettable that the Security Council . remains paralyzed,' he said. Mansour added that the Palestinian leadership 'must now . consider its next steps.' The Palestinians have threatened to . join the International Criminal Court, which they could then use . as a forum to push for war crimes proceedings against Israel. In a brief statement, Israeli delegate Israel Nitzan said . the Palestinians have found every possible opportunity to avoid . direct negotiations and brought the council 'a preposterous . unilateral proposal.' 'I have news for the Palestinians - you cannot agitate and . provoke your way to a state,' he said. French Ambassador Francois Delattre said Paris would . continue its efforts to get a resolution through the council . that would help move peace efforts forward. 'France regrets that it isn't possible to reach a consensus . today,' he said, noting that he voted for the resolution despite . having reservations about its contents. 'Our efforts must not . stop here. It is our responsibility to try again.' An earlier Palestinian draft called for Jerusalem to be the . shared capital of Israel and a Palestinian state. The draft that . was voted on reverted to a harder line, saying only that East . Jerusalem would be Palestine's capital and calling for an end to . Israeli settlement building. The Israeli government had said that a Security Council . vote, following the collapse in April of U.S.-brokered talks on . Palestinian statehood, would only deepen the conflict. Israel, which pulled troops and settlers out of the Gaza . Strip in 2005, has said its eastern border would be indefensible . if it withdrew completely from the West Bank.

"A farmer’s £2million home was sold to his brother for a fraction of its value after a solicitor forged his signature on land deeds, his family claimed last night. The solicitor confessed to police that he had faked the signature of Thomas Evans on the sale of his 485-acre farm and was charged with fraud. But days before the lawyer was due to appear in court he was found drowned and the criminal case was dropped as a consequence. However, it has led to a bitter feud between the children of farmer Thomas Evans, who died in November 2009, and their uncle Dafydd Evans, who with his wife Mair bought the farm near Dolgellau, North Wales, shortly before his brother’s death. The home of Thomas Evans (left), who was said to have mental health problems, was sold after solicitor Gareth Evans (right) allegedly faked his signature. A legal battle is looming after both men since died . Thomas Evans’s daughter Ceri Littler said her father was mentally ill and an alcoholic and so had no idea of the actions of his older brother in the sale of the farm. ‘He was a very poorly man, it’s horrendous and quite unbelievable,’ said Mrs Littler, 34, who claims the farm has since been valued at £2million. Referring to the solicitor who allegedly forged her father’s signature, Gareth Evans (no relation), she added: ‘We have a transcript of Gareth Evans’s police confession and we know my father’s signature was definitely forged, but his brother refuses to acknowledge it was illegal. If it was legitimate, why was my father’s signature forged? ‘Nieces and nephews have been done out of their inheritance but my uncle won’t enter into any dialogue with us about it, so now we are waiting to hear from the Land Registry as to whether we can get it back. It is not about the money, it is about getting justice for my father and getting back what was rightfully his.’ Mrs Littler said she and her siblings Roslyn, 36, Jonathan, 30, and step-brothers Sion, 30, and Iwan, 19, realised there were problems with their father’s affairs after his death from liver problems aged 52 in 2009. They began looking into the sale of his farm, where he was born and raised, and employed forensic handwriting experts who proved the signature on Land Registry deeds, transferring the ownership of the farm to his brother in April 2009, were fake, before alerting police. The family of 'vulnerable' man who died after his north Wales farm (pictured)  was sold following an alleged fraud by a solicitor, later found dead, face a potential legal battle to have the sale overturned . It is understood Dafydd Evans and his wife were questioned but never formally arrested and denied any wrongdoing. They refused to comment when contacted by the Daily Mail. Even though the solicitor’s confession was handed to the Land Registry in February, it has so far refused to overturn the sale. Mrs Littler said that if the sale was declared invalid, the money could be returned to her father’s estate and her uncle would then be entitled to claim compensation from the Land Registry, but ten months later they are still awaiting a decision. Accountant Debbie Chatham, 54, Thomas Evans’s first wife and Mrs Littler’s mother, said: ‘The Land Registry have done everything they can to dodge our application and have been reluctant to admit they made a mistake. ‘Gareth Evans was in a position of trust and he totally abused that. It’s very frustrating. We’ve got such indisputable evidence. You can’t get much better evidence than a confession, but still nothing has been done.’ The body of solicitor Gareth Evans was found on Black Rock Sands after he allegedly admitted fraud to police . At an inquest into Gareth Evans’s death in July the coroner recorded an open verdict, saying he could not be certain the ‘devoted’ father of three had committed suicide. Mr Evans, a former deputy high sheriff of Meirionnydd, had left for work as usual, asking his wife what was for supper, before his car was later found abandoned near a railway bridge. His body was found washed up near Porthmadog, 15 miles away. At the time of his death his family said in a statement: ‘As far as the family is concerned, Gareth Evans is innocent and not guilty of any offence. No court has found him guilty of any crime. This is an allegation of fraud and has not been proven.’ They were also asked to comment on the alleged confession but did not respond. A spokesman for North Wales Police said: ‘We can confirm that no one else has been arrested in connection with this case.’ A spokesman for the Land Registry said: ‘We are in contact with the solicitors representing Mr Thomas Evans’s children about their application regarding their clients’ claim to the property. This process has not been completed and we will continue to work with all parties to resolve the situation.’","Gareth Evans worked on sale of house owned by late Thomas Evans .

"Residents in a Sussex street were left with a very different parking problem when a hot air balloon suddenly landed between parked cars in the middle of their street. The balloon flew close to the roofs of houses in Midhurst in Sussex, leading people to fear they could be hit by the craft, before it made an emergency landing. People who witnessed the strange arrival of the balloon said that pilots told them it had run out of fuel and been forced to land. A hot air balloon was forced to make an emergency landing between parked cars in a residential street in Midhurst in Sussex after the craft reportedly ran out of fuel and it was seen flying close to roofs of houses . They claimed to have seen the pilots struggling to keep the flame going before making the emergency landing. The craft, which used to be owned by British Airways but now belongs to a private owner, sailed down to the middle of Barlavington Way in Midhurst at about 12.30pm on Tuesday. It was one of three seen at the time but was the only balloon to make an emergency landing. Steve Bull captured the incident on camera and said: 'It was more worrying than surreal as it slowly descended towards and then between houses. 'We often see hot air balloons in the sky around here in the summer but never in the winter.' Others said they were concerned that buildings or cars could be damaged by the surprise landing but said they were impressed when the pilot managed to calmly land the craft between two vehicles. Sophie May Lewis, 22, who lives on the street, said the pilots claimed they were running low on gas and were forced to ditch in the street. People living in Barlavington Way said they were shocked to discover a hot air balloon parked in the road . She said: 'Quite a few people had come out to have a look but they were only in the street around half an hour and then they were gone. 'The pilots were quite lucky there was a space between the parked cars but they landed it expertly. They did a brilliant job. 'It was quite an impressive sight when they deflated but I think a few people were a bit worried about their cars.' Writing on the Midhurst Facebook page, Simone Pontet-piccolomini added: 'There were 3 on the horizon when i first saw them then this one landed right at the end of my little road....i watched as the pilot struggled to get the flame going....neatly done though...i saw the other 2 in the distance, both pretty low over the town.' After the surprise landing the pilots were forced to carefully deflate the balloon and remove it. The balloon is emblazoned with a British Airways logo and has the name Concorde on its side. It took pilots about 30 minutes to deflate the craft and pack it up so they could take it away from the street . The balloon had to be carefully deflated after it landed and was packed up and removed in half an hour . However, according to records held by the Civil Aviation Authority BA sold the hot air balloon in 2008 and it was bought by Anthony Brown, of Guildford. Mr Brown is listed in connection with Reach for the Sky Limited, a hot air balloon flight company. Mr Brown could not be reached for comment by MailOnline today. Charlie Bush, who also lives in the road, told the Midhurst and Petworth Observer that the pilots said they had been 'running low on gas'. She added: 'He said a few of them had set off, but they had to bring it down here. They could see there was a clear space in the road, and were only there for about half an hour.' The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has not been contacted about the incident. A CAA spokesman said: 'Unfortunately this sort of incident does happen from time-to-time. 'The fact is that sometimes if the wind is in the wrong direction or there is some sort of fault then pilots have to put down somewhere, even in an urban area. They are perfectly entitled to do that. It is not like a plane landing there. They are trained to do it.'","Hot air balloon made an emergency landing on a Sussex residential street .

"Threats have been made to kill NYPD officers ahead of New Year's Eve celebrations tonight, according to reports. Several threats have been made relating to the start of the new year, DNAInfo reported. There are currently 23 open investigations over threats, a source told the website. The NYPD reported that there have been 70 investigated cases and 16 arrests.  A police spokesperson told Daily Mail Online on Wednesday that the force will remain vigilant and investigate the origins of all threats as well as adjust security measures accordingly. New York City police officers search revellers entering Times Square on New Year's Eve. Threats have reportedly been made to kill cops amid tonight's celebrations . The NYPD are dealing with threats including sinister messages posted on social media (pictured above) According to DNAInfo and The New York Post, gang members had posted sinister messages on social media including 'Bullets give them wings' and 'Keep Calm And Bury A Cop.' Ominous hashtags have also spread online, such as #@deadcopseveryday, #onlydeadcops, #wingsonpigs. Thousands of  officers prepared for protests in Times Square against excessive police force as an enormous crowd of revelers gathered there under unusually tight security for the nation's biggest New Year's Eve celebrations. In the hours before the giant crystal ball drops at midnight, bomb-sniffing dogs and counter-terrorism units joined uniformed officers posted on the streets around the famed Manhattan crossroads. Other officers were stationed on rooftops and at area subway stations. Police told DNAInfo it will safeguard party-goers along with those who wanted to demonstrate. Police Chief Jim O'Neill said at a press conference on Tuesday: 'Times Square is probably the safest place in New York City on New Years's Eve.' Thousands of officers prepared for protests in Times Square (pictured today) against excessive police force as an enormous crowd of revelers gathered there under unusually tight security for the nation's biggest New Year's Eve celebrations . And NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton added his vote of confidence on Wednesday. Bratton tweeted: 'Stopped by the @NYPD114Pct to thank the members for their hard work & wish them a safe New Year's Eve tour.' All threats made against law enforcement were being taken extremely seriously by investigators following the brutal slayings of Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu on December 20. Killer Ismaaiyl Brinsley walked up to the two officers in their car in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn and shot them at point-blank range before turning the gun on himself. Prior to the killings, Brinsley had posted threatening messages on social media including a vow to 'put wings on pigs'. The NYPD have acted quickly following recent threats including the arrest of Elvin Payamps of Queens after he was overheard talking on his cell phone about wanting to murder two white officers. Officers Rafael Ramos, left, and Wenjian Liu, right, were shot dead by Brinsley in their police car on December 20 . Payamps allegedly told a friend that he wished the two cops assassinated in Brooklyn had been white and vowed to 'make it right' by shooting more officers. Unbeknown to Payamps, 38, his threats were overheard ex-NYPD officer Charles Otero who was standing nearby,  the New York Post reported. Otero called 911, and Payamps was later stopped by the police. He was found to have marijuana on his person and taken into custody. At Payamps' house, officers found a Jimenez Arms 9mm pistol and a Mossberg Maverick 12-gauge shotgun with defaced serial numbers, as well as two bulletproof vests and brass knuckles. Payamps allegedly confessed to stealing one of the vests from the Brooklyn Detention Center and to making the threat against officers. He was ordered held in lieu of $500,000 bail on felony weapons charges, along with charges of felony aggravated harassment, unlawful use of a police uniform and pot possession.","The NYPD reported that there have been 70 investigated cases and 16 arrests over threats to officers .

"What would happen if the moon was replaced by various planets in the sky? One YouTube user has taken a look at this hypothetical scenario - and the results are rather impressive. In a video they show how moving the planets closer would fill our sky with stunning views - and it reveals just how large some of the planets are compared to the moon. Scroll down for video . A YouTube user from Alabama has illustrated planets in the night sky (Saturn shown). They illustrated how the planets would look in the moon's position. The video reveals how large some would appear in hypothetical scenario. If it did happen, it's unlikely Earth would survive the close encounters . The video was created by YouTube user Yeti Dynamics. ‘This is a visualization of what it might be like if the Moon was replaced with some of the other planets at the same distance as our moon,’ they explain. Moon: 1,080 miles (1,738km) Mars: 2,111 miles (3,397km) Venus: 3,761 miles (6,052km) Neptune (equatorial): 15,701 miles (25,269km) Uranus (equatorial): 15,882 miles (25,559km) Saturn (equatorial, not including rings): 37,449 miles (60,268km) Jupiter (equatorial): 44,422 miles (71,490km) In order the video shows Mars, Venus, Neptune, Uranus, Jupiter and Saturn in place of the moon. Mercury is purposefully left off as it is a similar size to the moon ‘and hence is boring.’ With our moon measuring a paltry 1,738km in radius, the other planets dwarf it in size when shown in its position about 240,000 miles (384,000km) from Earth. Mars, for instance, is about twice the size, with a radius of 1,080 miles (3,397km). Uranus is about 25 times larger at 15,882 miles (25,559km) in radius, while Jupiter completely outclasses it with a radius of 44,422 miles 71,490km). Interestingly, some of the moons of the planets would also be in a collision course with Earth. Dione, for example, which orbits Saturn at a distance of 235,000 miles (377,000km), would likely impact Earth if Saturn were in place of the moon. Here Saturn is seen, pictured by Voyager 1 in 1980, with its moons Tethys (bottom left) and Dione (middle). If Saturn were in the position of the moon, it's likely that Dione would impact Earth at some point - although of course the scenario is only hypothetical . Another interesting effect would be the gravitational influence on Earth if the planets were placed that close. They could strip away our atmosphere and cause huge tides and volcanoes. If Jupiter were the planet in the moon's position, it’s likely Earth would not even survive intact, being close enough to possibly be ripped apart and form a ring around the gas giant. A second video also reveals what the moon would look like if it were in the position of the ISS. With our moon measuring a paltry 1,738km in radius, the other planets dwarf it in size when shown in its position about 240,000 miles (384,000km) from Earth (illustration shown) At an orbital height of just 255 miles (415km), the ISS is relatively close to Earth. But place the moon there and it would fill most of the sky as Earth rotates, blocking out the sun and sending the planet into darkness for long portions. Of course, all of these scenarios are merely hypothetical and just a light-hearted look at the solar system. But they do help to illustrated the different sizes of objects in Earth’s vicinity.","YouTube user from Alabama has illustrated planets in the night sky .

"There’s a new buzz to beauty gadgets in 2015. This year, the key to glowing skin, shiny teeth and silky smooth legs lies with the latest vibrating technology. Vibrating gadgets can be used to remove hair more easily, increase blood flow to ease aches and pains and can even reduce the look of wrinkles. Alice Smellie tried out a selection and asked cosmetic expert Dr Hilary Allan at Woodford Medical to give her opinion. Polishing teeth . Aldi dental polisher, £9.99, Aldi (from January 11) THE VIBE: A home dental hygiene product for cleaning teeth, eliminating plaque and removing stains in seconds. THE TEST: Although I loathe going to the dentist, I love the fresh feeling in your mouth as you leave with squeaky-clean teeth. The device looks like a small drill but with a little silicone cup at the end which I fill with my normal toothpaste. The vibration is surprisingly forceful and I struggle to hold the polisher against my teeth. An unattractive line of dribble trickles down my chin as I run it along my front top teeth for about a minute as instructed and then inspect them in the mirror. They feel very clean and look shiny. I’m impressed. THE EXPERT: The vibrations agitate bits of calcium deposit, not plaque, which form on the teeth, so they come off and teeth are polished smooth. There have been studies done into the use of such machines in dogs with problem teeth and results have been excellent. 9/10 . Deep skin-cleansing . Foreo Luna Mini, £99, lookfantastic.com . THE VIBE: The first T-sonic facial-cleansing brush, for a deep and gentle clean in just one minute. THE TEST: This device uses something called T-sonic technology that generates up to 8,000 pulsations per minute. The Foreo Luna is about the size of a jam jar lid and the thickness of a large roll of Sellotape. I clean my face then wet the Luna, running it over my dry cheeks, forehead and nose. The rapid vibration is gloriously soothing. But beyond looking slightly flushed, I still don’t get the vibrating cleanser thing — I can achieve the same effect with an exfoliator. THE EXPERT: Really, it’s facial cleansing for lazy people. If you must invest in one of these cleansers, this might be a good choice as it’s easy to clean. 7/10 . Massaging feet . BFF Mini Foot Massager, £9.99, jmldirect.com . THE VIBE: Press down to activate the soothing vibrations while six massaging rollers knead aches and pains away. THE TEST: After a morning of cleaning the house, I had aching feet and unpacked this surprisingly elegant-looking item with enthusiasm. I placed my feet one at a time on the rollers and pressed down gently. The entire machine vibrates, but you have to create your own deep tissue massage sensation by running your foot up and down the rollers. I’m a fan of hugely painful reflexology where the feet literally crackle, so I would have enjoyed more pressure. I wouldn’t say my feet felt completely refreshed, but they were certainly much better. THE EXPERT: This is great. Blood circulation will be increased to the feet, and therefore more oxygen and nutrients brought to the area, and if you’ve been on your feet all day, massaging the muscles and tendons on the sole of the foot will alleviate tension and tightness. 6/10 . Exfoliation . Elle Macpherson wet and dry face and body brush from Homedics, £39.99, lookfantastic.com . THE VIBE: All-over deep-cleansing and exfoliation. THE TEST: This comes with four detachable heads for the separate functions: a dry brush for exfoliating the body, a pumice stone to remove dry skin on the feet, a loofah for gentle exfoliation in the shower and a facial cleansing brush. It’s winter and my feet are as dry as withered husks. The rotating pumice stone sloughs off the dead skin rapidly and painlessly, which is highly satisfying. I take the loofah into the shower and administer a top to toe rubdown, after which my skin feels softer. My favourite attachment is the dry brush, which is slightly abrasive on my dry thighs, but leaves them tingling and looking smoother. The facial cleansing brush is also invigorating. THE EXPERT: We know that such beauty tricks as dry brushing for circulation and skin tone, and pumice to exfoliate dry skin are effective. Here, it’s taking the effort away by rotating and vibrating against the skin. 7/10 . Applying foundation . Skinpep auto make-up multi-functional auto-puff, £29.99, skinpep.co.uk . THE VIBE: The vibrating anti-bacterial puff provides smooth application with no lumps. Expertly blends liquid or powder foundation for professional results. THE TEST: This sounded like a ridiculous gimmick. I never have ‘lumps’ in my foundation. But then I have a think and realise that I don’t blend make-up very well around the edges of my face. Further reflection (and a quick chat with my husband) leads to the conclusion that I often look ‘blotchy’. I dab a little foundation onto the pad provided and turn the gadget on. I move it over my nose, across my forehead and then (as though I’m a painting by numbers colouring book) fill in the rest of my face. The gentle vibration feels soft. Incredibly, and I mean this, because I was quite prepared to be very rude — the finished look is dewy and even. THE EXPERT: If you look at skin microscopically, the surface is irregular, with lots of dead skin cells, and the incredibly fast vibrations of this gadget — 1,000-a-minute — will push foundation down and create a smooth surface. 9/10 . Quick fix facial anti-ageing . Crystal Clear Lift Away The Years (includes serum), £59.99, crystalclear.co.uk . THE VIBE: The combination of gentle vibrations coupled with intensely effective serum produces outstanding anti-ageing results after just two minutes. THE TEST: The serum is fresh and lemon-scented. The gadget looks like a felt pen. At the top is a little roller ball, which I unscrew and tip a little serum inside the lid. As you press the on button, this top bit starts to vibrate gently and I run the smooth, cold roller ball around my face. There is a technique to the lifting: first I work from the base of the neck towards my jawline in small circular movements. Next, I go from jawline to nose, then from cheeks towards ears and finally the forehead. My skin looks plumped up and fresh for a few hours and I’m sure daily use would produce more benefits. THE EXPERT: This is quite expensive. The oscillating head will improve blood flow to the skin, which brings vital nutrients and oxygen as well as removing toxins from the area, but I’m not sure it will make anyone look younger. 7/10 . Hair removal . Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power, £6.99, boots.com . THE VIBE: The blades glide effortlessly through hair with less pull and tug. THE TEST: I ask my husband to try this new electric razor, which looks like any standard razor but has a slightly bulkier handle because of the button at the front which causes the blade to vibrate. Mr Smellie has used the same razor since I have met him and is averse to change, but emerges from the shower reluctantly impressed the vibrations apparently create a good, close shave. I give it a go and the vibrating blade runs smoothly over my legs, whizzing off the stubble of hair which has accumulated in the week since I last shaved. The results are quite incredible and my legs and armpits are as smooth as a grape. It takes the same time as usual and is totally painless. THE EXPERT: Vibration supposedly makes hair stand up on end so that you can get a closer shave — which makes a great deal of sense. 8/10 . Full body massage . Scholl Comfort Shiatsu Massager, £112, amazon.co.uk . THE VIBE: Infrared heat helps to loosen tense muscles while the vibrating, two-level seat helps to relax tired legs. THE TEST: This is like a giant child’s car seat, which can be attached to an ordinary chair with strong Velcro strips. When turned on the seat vibrates, nodules roll up and down the spine and red light warms your back. Close your eyes and you could almost be in a tropical location, being pummelled by an expert. The pressure of the massage is firm, and feels like strong fingers, the heat from the infrared is deliciously warm on sore muscles, and the vibration of the seat invigorating. Probably not for all ages, but various members of my family (aged four to 91) tried it out and had to be forced off. THE EXPERT: Here, the heat will be improving blood flow to the muscles and therefore alleviating tension and pain. Combined with the deep massage and vibrating seat you are getting a triple whammy of relief. 10/10 .","The key to the best skin and teeth this year is vibrating technology .

"Nothing can keep Karla Sanchez San Martin, one of Mexico's few female bullfighters, from facing off against her bovine opponents. On Tuesday, the ambitious matador-in-training vowed to return to the ring by mid-January, two days after she and several others were gored by what she said was a 'very smart' bull. The 26-year-old bullfighter, who fights under the stage name of 'Karla de los Angeles,' suffered a pair of gashes to the thigh and buttock when she was gored twice by the 1,090-pound beast Gamusino. Scroll down for video . Bull warrior: Mexican matador Karla Sanchez San Martin vowed to return to the ring by mid-January after being gored twice by the same bull Sunday (pictured) in Mexico . Survivor: Karla Sanchez San Martin, one of Mexico's few female bullfighters, poses for a portrait in her hospital bed in Mexico City Tuesday during her treatment for a pair of gashes to the thigh and buttock . 'From almost the beginning, he was hunting me,' De los Angeles said from the hospital room where she was recovering from a 9 ½ inch wound to the thigh and 6-inch slash to the backside. De los Angeles was going in for the kill when the bull lifted his head, caught her with a horn and tossed her into the air. Bloodied and bandaged up, De los Angeles re-entered the ring at the Plaza de Toros de Mexico to finish off her formidable opponent. 'But the bull had already learned,' she said, noting he held his head high, making it hard for her to drive the sword in. He caught her a second time with a lifted horn and tossed her to the dirt, goring her again. A 1,090lb-bull named Gamusino threw Karla de los Angeles up over his head on Sunday as she went in to kill it . Another bull in Sunday's fight leapt over the ring wall, crushing a spectator's face. Another man, identified as a bull breeder, also suffered injuries to his hand. None of the injuries were considered life-threatening. 'It was one of those afternoons where the accidents happened one after the other, that leaves a bad taste in the mouths of those in the ring and the stands,' the Plaza Mexico bull ring wrote in an article on its web site. De los Angeles said of the wounds, 'the truth is, right now it hurts a little bit' but 'this is not going to discourage me.' She said she has a fight on January 18, 'and I'm going to be there.' Federico Dominguez, de los Angeles' assistant, was also gored by the massive bull, BBC reported. Gamusino injured two different assistants as well as a farmer after he leaped over the ring and went into a walkway, according to AFP. One of the assistants reportedly had a concussion and is in serious condition. Some 5,000 people went to the bullring on Sunday, as part of a ten-day event, the wire service reported. After being attended to by medics Ms de los Angeles continued the fight only to be gored a second time . Speaking to Picture Radio in Spanish, de los Angeles said, 'I'm sad because I could not cut off an ear and I could not kill a second bull. 'It was [a very bloody run], there were many mishaps, thank God, so far as it goes, we're fine,' she told Picture Radio. 'You have to accept it as it is, to recover and what comes.' De los Angeles' Facebook shows that in addition to being a female bullfighter, she is also the mother of a three-year-old daughter. AFP reported that it was the first time three female Mexican bullfighters participated in an event at the Plaza de Toros de Mexico. During General Francisco Franco's reign, women in Spain were not allowed to be matadors, BBC reported. That has since changed, though not many  bullfight professionally.

"Catching crooks is too hard, and home security's too soft. But one burglary victim discovered something just right for stopping a thief - his bed. Baffled Kevin Connolly found a would-be criminal dozing mid-raid in his guest room in Houston, Texas, when he got up to drive to the airport at 4am. The thief failed to wake up even when the homeowner switched on the light - only rousing himself when arresting officers dragged him from the bed. Just right! A Goldilocks-like thief was caught fast asleep in the spare bed of a house he was in the middle of stealing from (left). Police arrested a man named as 22-year-old Christopher Provazek (right) Mr Connolly said he woke up yesterday to find a bag missing along with a string of his possessions missing, including his MacBook Pro, iPad, guitar and even his dog's ashes. He told local news stations he went downstairs and felt cold air sweeping through the house, so he knew someone must have opened a window. He grabbed his gun and searched every room before finding, to his surprise, the placid thief curled up on the sheets. Police named the sleeping man as 22-year-old Christopher Provazek, and said dozens of Mr Connolly's possessions were on his porch - along with a half-drunk bottle of liquor. Victim: Homeowner Kevin Connolly made sure to take a few photos while police were on their way . Mr Connolly told click2houston.com he believed the thief may have made multiple trips before passing out in a booze-fuelled haze. Provazek reportedly said he'd been framed, to which the homeowner replied the 22-year-old was still wearing his jacket. Mr Connolly told the news station: 'I said ""Hey buddy. Wake up, what are you doing here?"" No response. I turned the light on and took a few pictures just for giggles. 'He told me he had been framed for the job and I reminded him that he couldn't have been framed because he was wearing my jacket'. Provazek was arrested and burglary charges are pending, according to multiple reports.

"The eight-year-old son of the AirAsia QZ8501 captain is unaware his father’s plane has crashed and believes his ‘daddy is still at work’, relatives have said. Captain Iriyanto, an experienced former military jet pilot, crashed in airspace thick with storm clouds between Indonesia and Singapore while piloting the Airbus with 162 people on board on Sunday. The pilot’s brother Budi Sutiono told the Telegraph Iriyanto’s son Arya Galih Gegara has been told his father is still at work. ‘He keeps asking us and he keeps crying because he misses his father,’ Mr Sutino said. The family have switched all the televisions in the house off and will break the news to eight-year-old Galih gradually. ‘Slowly we will try to explain what has happened to his father. But it needs time,’ he added. AirAsia pilot Captain Iriyanto's eight-year-old son Arya Galih Gegara has been told his father is still at work . Captain Iriyanto's plane crashed in airspace thick with storm clouds between Indonesia and Singapore . Captain Iriyanto’s daughter made an emotional plea for her father to come home when news of the plane’s disappearance first broke, telling him: 'I still need you'. His picture was posted on social media by his 22-year-old daughter Angela Ranastianis with the heartbreaking message: 'Papa, please come home, I still need you. Bring back my papa.' Cpt Iriyanto's father said the last time he saw his son was at the funeral of his other son who died of diabetes last week. Suwarto, who has only one name, told the BBC he hoped he would see his son again, but accepted it would be God's will if he didn't. The pilot's devastated wife Widiya Sukati Putri told Bloomberg News on Tuesday he always prioritised his family when not flying. 'When I see the kids, I must be strong,' she said. 'Papa, come home, I still need you': Angela Ranastianis, the daughter of missing AirAsia pilot Iriyanto, made an emotional appeal for her father to return safely after posting this picture with him online . Captain Iriyanto was an Air Force pilot who flew F-16 fighter jets before taking early retirement to become a commercial airline pilot . At Iriyanto's house in the East Java town of Sidoarjo, neighbours, relatives and friends gathered to pray and recite the Quran to support the distraught family. Their desperate cries were so loud, they could sometimes be heard outside where three LCD televisions had been set up to monitor search developments. 'He is a good man. That's why people here appointed him as our neighbourhood chief for the last two years,' said Bagianto Djoyonegoro, a friend and neighbour, adding that despite being busy with his job, Iriyanto was always very active in the community and attentive to the needs of the people around him. Cpt Iriyanto's nephew told Indonesian news outlet Detik.com his uncle, who is married with two young children, was 'a very caring person'. 'When I see the kids, I must be strong': Captain Iriyanto's wife is seen here on December 30, 2014 in Surabaya, Indonesia . When out of the cockpit Iriyanto spent time with his family, his wife Widiya Sukati Putri said in tears . He said: 'He is always helping people because he is a very caring person. If there is a sick relative who needed help and even money, my uncle would be there. 'If there are money problems in the family, he would surely help.'

"Lady Butler-Sloss said there had been an Establishment cover-up of child abuse . There was an Establishment cover-up of horrific child abuse because powerful figures looked after themselves, former judge Lady Butler-Sloss warned today. Senior members of British society in the past did not think child abuse was as serious or important as protecting politicians and other members of the elite, she suggested. Lady Butler-Sloss was forced to quit as chairman of the wide-ranging inquiry into allegations of a cover-up because her brother was in the Cabinet in the 1980s. But she insisted if she had stayed in post and been able to run the inquiry she would have 'cut the whole thing open'. Lady Butler-Sloss's resignation in July came less than a week after David Cameron agreed to an inquiry into allegations that politicians, the police, the judiciary, celebrities, the BBC, the NHS and the Church conspired to cover-up abuse over several decades. It followed concerns that her brother Michael Havers sat in the Cabinet as attorney general during the 1980s - the period on which claims of a cover-up are focussed. Lady Butler Sloss insisted she could have done the job, arguing that 'as a judge with 35 years' experience on the bench, I was quite able to be independent and say that people got it wrong and to be critical of them'. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, which she guest edited today, she said abuse over decades was kept from public view. 'I do believe the establishment has in the past looked after itself, partly because people did not really recognise the seriousness of child abuse and they did not think it was so important, and it was important to protect members of the establishment,' she said. 'So I would want to go in with a knife and cut the whole thing open and expose it, as to what happened, bearing in mind, of course, that the views of those people are not the views of people today and that is a difficulty.' She said she took the job of chairing the inquiry not because she want to do it but it 'needed to be done'. 'It never crossed my mind that my brother would be an impediment.' In October the second chairman of the inquiry, Fiona Woolf, was forced to resign after failing to declare the extent of her links to Tory peer Leon Brittan, who was allegedly handed a dossier detailing abuse. An MP battling to expose a suspected Westminster child sex ring has been accused by fellow politicians of ‘peddling conspiracy theories’. John Mann said he has been vilified for championing those who claim they were abused by paedophiles in positions of power. But the Labour MP said he will not be deterred from pursuing a full public inquiry into their ordeal. He said time was running out for the authorities to get to the bottom of claims aimed at the heart of the Establishment. The Government is expected to announce the timescale and terms of reference for an inquiry within weeks. Campaigners are gearing up for a crunch meeting at Parliament in a fortnight as police continue to probe claims three boys were abused and murdered. Groups representing victims and survivors of abuse warned Home Secretary Theresa May they were losing confidence in the inquiry. But Lady Butler-Sloss said that effectively giving campaign groups the final decision on who chairs the inquiry 'creates real problems'. She said: 'I worry that the victims, survivors - for whom I have the most enormous sympathy, and as a judge I tried a great many child abuse cases, I really have huge sympathy for them - but for them to be deciding who should become the person chairing it creates real problems. 'Because if you did not have, in the past, a position of authority, how are you going to be able to run the inquiry? 'You need someone who knows how to run things and if you get someone from an obscure background with no background of establishment, they will find it very difficult and may not be able, actually, to produce the goods.' She also defended the decision to make Fiona Woolf a Dame in the New Year's Honours List, so soon after her resignation. She said criticism of the honour was 'very unfair' as it was in recognition of her term as Lord Mayor of London. Defending the decision to award the honour, she said: 'She was Lord Mayor of London, she is only the second woman ever to be Lord Mayor of London. Fiona Woolf (pictured) becomes a dame two months after being forced to resign as chairman of the Government's child abuse inquiry . 'The very least that the honours system could do would be to honour a woman who has got such a distinguished post. 'Unfortunately she had, like myself, a brief period where she had agreed - for goodness sake, she had agreed to do a very disagreeable job to become chairman. 'And because she happened to know Leon Brittan, she was unacceptable to the survivors and therefore she stood down.' But Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who exposed the Cyril Smith child sex scandal, said the damehood 'seems inappropriate', adding: 'I can think of many more worthy recipients … once again it looks like the Establishment are looking after their own.' He added: 'The public will be disappointed that people such as Fiona Woolf are receiving honours when there are people who are much more worthy of an honour, people who have done courageous things, or have achieved things for their country. 'I'm sure her achievements warrant an honour but the timing is a bit off. I suspect some people might be upset and it might have been more appropriate to let a bit of time elapse.'","Lady Butler-Sloss says Establishment did not think abuse was serious .

"If you're looking for the cheapest pint this New Year's Eve, head to Leeds, while Birmingham is your best bet for the most affordable bed for the night. With people all over the UK getting ready to don their party gear for the most celebrated night of the year, it pays to do your research for the best overall experience. And it's Birmingham that comes out as the cheapest for the action packed night of beers, club entry, taxi journey and hotel room stay, averaging at £111.38 per person. The most expensive for the same thrills is Edinburgh, costing on average £308.10. Of all the capital cities across the British Isles, Edinburgh steals the show when it comes to pubs per square mile, according to research from hotel bookings site, Hotel Direct. Looking to bust some well-publicised myths, the low-cost accommodation specialist has been looking into a number of criteria to determine the best place to party this New Year's Eve; average cost of a hotel room, Average cost of a pint, average taxi fare per mile, average club entry, pubs per square mile, whether or not there are there fireworks, and if they are free. London's New Year celebrations are always spectacular, but a room for the night once the party has finished doesn't come cheap . Among other findings, Hotel Direct found that the Scottish capital boasts 104 pubs per square mile, as compared to Dublin's 55. Cardiff trails with just 39. Hotel Direct also compared some other party city heavyweights; Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. Leeds triumphed at the beer pumps, averaging out at £2.40, with Birmingham close on its tails at £2.58. Even London, though renowned for high prices, turns out cheaper than many of its counterparts (most notably Dublin), coming in at £3.68 a pint as compared to the Irish capital's £4.41. Edinburgh's New Year celebrations topped the charts in terms of expense - the full package could cost around £310 . That said, the expense of the UK capital was plain to see in the £7.30 average charged by taxi companies per mile. And while public transport may be free between 11.45pm and 4.30am, the £10 entry fee for fireworks (the only city to charge) and highest average club entry of £32 reaffirmed London's reputation as a pricey micro-economy. Hotel Direct have also contributed their own hotel room prices, where Birmingham stands proud as the cheapest place for a hotel room, averaging at £82 for a room over New Year's Eve 2014, in comparison to Edinburgh's £283 per night price tag. Other factors for comparison included the average cost of club entry and propensity of fireworks. Of all the cities compared, Hotel Direct found that it was just Belfast that had lost its spark, with no official council-run fireworks event this New Year's Eve. Revellers celebrating New Year in Cardiff - but they might be disappointed that the Welsh capital has the least number of pubs per square mile from the research . Hotel Direct MD, Mark Wilson, said: 'We're all for encouraging people to have a great time at New Year but have found in the past that the majority of our bookings have come in for destinations outside the British Isles, such as Paris and New York. 'However, we wanted to showcase the wide variety of events happening this side of the Channel and instigate a bit of inter-city rivalry.' 'We were really interested to see that certain myths, such as Dublin having the most pubs per square mile, could be so easily busted. I was also surprised that in a climate of cuts, the majority of the cities all offered free fireworks.'

"Ministers were under growing pressure last night to toughen up measures to protect the public from ebola. They have already promised to review airport screening after Scottish nurse Pauline Cafferkey was allowed home despite complaining of a fever – and having her temperature checked seven times at Heathrow. Other colleagues who returned at the same time described the system at the airport as ‘shambolic’ and said they had to queue in cramped rooms where the virus could be passed on to others. Scottish nurse Pauline Cafferkey was allowed home despite complaining of a fever – and having her temperature checked seven times at Heathrow . Ms Cafferkey (seen centre, back) with a group of doctors and nurses in November, as they left Heathrow for Freetown, Sierra Leone . Experts have called for healthcare workers returning from West Africa to be kept away from public places for at least three weeks – the time it can take for the virus to develop and for symptoms to appear. At the moment, they can travel home on crowded buses and trains and continue using them during the 21-day incubation period. In US states such as New York and New Jersey, volunteers returning from West Africa are effectively quarantined in their own homes and must avoid public places including football matches for at least three weeks. Labour MP Keith Vaz, who chairs the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said: ‘It’s time to review and assess the arrangements. ‘The Government was right to bring in screening, but there are various degrees of screening. ‘We need to know how many people have been put in place at our borders and how many are trained – immigration officers are not equipped to deal with this. The Government needs to be clear about who they are, what training they have received and what equipment they have at their disposal. ‘The Home Secretary needs to confirm that no immigration officers are involved in this process.’ Dr Devi Sridhar, of Edinburgh University, said quarantining might be too strict but as a compromise, returning health workers could be told to avoid public places. She added: ‘The Government feels pressure to act. ‘But in the UK ebola has not until now been an issue, while in the US there was a sense of mass hysteria. ‘But there is a middle way we could adopt where people coming back from countries affected by ebola are told to avoid busy public places for the three-week incubation period.’ Special care: After being put on a cocooned bed Ms Cafferkey was loaded on to the jet, which took off this morning and landed at RAF Northolt near Heathrow . Officials are also under pressure to change temperature tests. These are currently the most accurate and quickest way to diagnose the illness, because a sudden fever is one of the earliest symptoms. Blood tests do not work because ebola can only be detected once a patient already has symptoms, such as a fever or vomiting. At the moment, any healthcare worker who is 37.5C (99.5F) or above – compared with the normal body temperature of 37C (98.6F) – is sent to hospital for tests. But one option would be to bring this down to a more precise figure such as 37.2 or 37.3C. Another would be to ensure workers remain in a secure area for at least 24 hours while they undergo repeated checks on their temperature . Miss Cafferkey, 39, had her temperature tested at Heathrow but then complained she had a fever while still at the airport and it was then checked a further six times over an hour but was still deemed normal. Treatment: The nurse has been transferred to the specialist high-level isolation wing of London's Royal Free Hospital . Yet just 12 hours later it had rocketed and she was in an isolation unit. Had she been made to stay at the airport this would have been picked up. Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer, said: ‘Clearly queuing and things like that are unacceptable and we will review. But we will let people who are well travel because they will not infect the public.’ Speaking of Miss Cafferkey, . she added: ‘She was well. She had no symptoms. Her temperature was within the acceptable range. She would not be transmitting the virus, therefore she was cleared as fit to fly.’ A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘This person was tested as part of the screening process at Heathrow and, as with all health workers, she was advised to contact Public Health England if she had any concerns. ‘She did this, while still at Heathrow, and went through a further six temperature checks. Naturally, we will be reviewing what happened and the screening protocols, and if anything needs to be changed it will be.’ Here are some of the options that ministers wanting to bring in tougher measures to protect the public may consider: . BLOOD TEST . This is used to confirm ebola in a patient who has symptoms. But scientists say it would not pick up the virus unless someone has symptoms, so would therefore be pointless.

Volunteers are allowed to use public transport and carry out daily activities – even though they may develop ebola up to 21 days after treating infected patients. In certain US states such as Maine and New York, they are placed in quarantine throughout this period – either in a unit next to a hospital or in their own homes. Some have said they felt stigmatised and treated inhumanely when they were only trying to help. The concern is that such strict measures would deter healthcare workers from volunteering.","Pauline Cafferkey was allowed home despite complaining of a fever .

"A hand-built animal shelter has been left ransacked after vandals broke in, causing thousands of pounds worth of damage and releasing vulnerable animals into the wild. The break-in is believed to have taken place on Monday night at the Blyth Wildlife Rescue site near Newcastle-upon-Tyne, used to house creatures before they are let back into the wild in spring. The huge damage inflicted on the sheds, cabins and aviaries has led John Anderson - who founded the charity in 2006 to support injured birds and small mammals - to warn its future is now in doubt. Devastation: Blyth Wildlife Rescue volunteer Christine Thompson is pictured among the damage to the site . The facility houses hedgehogs, pigeons, an eider duck, sparrow hawk and barn owls. All have been accounted for except for one sparrow hawk and two barn owls, as well as several pigeons. Mr Anderson, 26, told MailOnline: ‘The place has been smashed to pieces, things poured onto the ground. They’ve had to go out of their way and trespassed on a substantial size of land to get here. ‘We all have property and things that are important to us, but this site is something I've spent so much time on. Everything that has been damaged has been built with our own hands. 'It's been smashed to pieces for absolutely no reason. All of a sudden it's gone. It's not just the actual value of items that have been stolen - it's the cost of time and funds needed to repair them.’ He added: ‘I knew something was wrong when I couldn’t open the gate on Tuesday afternoon. After being let in by the landowner we found a scene of absolute chaos. It was a stab to the heart. ‘It was like the Tasmanian Devil had been there or an earthquake had hit - everything you could imagine. All the doors were open, things were smashed up in the buildings.

It was complete devastation. It had been ransacked.’ The site, which is kept hidden from the public by a 9ft fence and razor wire, is thought to have been entered by offenders scaling the gate. They went on to steal a generator and power tools. Mr Anderson said: ‘Fortunately we have secured the majority of our patients and these animals have been moved away into secure accommodation. ‘We are keeping our fingers crossed for those who left as they really weren’t ready to be released and we looked after them for so long. ‘But as you can imagine, everything is very much up in the air when it comes to the long-term prospects of the charity. It took us a long time to get here and this was more than a burglary. ‘It was not just damaged sheds as they were built by hand for a specific purpose by volunteers to help animals in need. These people were not just there to steal.’ Local residents have already begun coming forward with donations and offers of manpower to help the charity get back on track.

'After she had done it and took the child to the hospital, she blamed her own granddaughter for doing it,' said the prosecutor, reports KWCH. Garrett even made her three-year-old granddaughter spray Booth with the shower water, making the girl believe she was responsible, according to investigators. Two months later, detectives brought Garrett back for further questioning and she confessed. Sheriff Kelly Herzet says Garrett ran an unlicensed daycare out of her home. He says she admitted to spraying Caden with scalding hot water from a detachable shower head during potty training.

"UK spies foiled a Taliban attack on Camp Bastion in Afghanistan while British troops were still in the country. Eavesdroppers at GCHQ exposed the plot by monitoring chatter between an insurgent and other militants. The agency had mounted its biggest overseas deployment since the Second World War by running a string of listening posts across southern Afghanistan to protect British soldiers. An earlier assault on Camp Bastion – in September 2012 – cost the lives of two US marines, saw five RAF personnel injured and ended with the destruction of fighter jets worth £130million. UK spies foiled a Taliban attack on Camp Bastion in Afghanistan while British troops were still in the country . It was only because of the ability of GCHQ analysts to access large amounts of data to search for previously unknown security threats that the plan was foiled. Following Edward Snowden’s revelations about the surveillance capabilities of US and British intelligence agencies, privacy campaigners have called to curb these powers. It is understood the rate of military operations led by intelligence gathered by GCHQ rose over the course of the conflict to more than half of all missions. Such intelligence proved vital after the first assault on Camp Bastion in Helmand province when insurgents breached security at the base in September 2012. They killed two US Marines, injured five RAF personnel and destroyed fighter jets worth £130 million. In the following months, officials from the intelligence agency in Britain identified an insurgent who, until then, had been unknown to them. The man had been communicating with known militants. The discovery triggered further analysis and a Taliban network – at least ten strong – was uncovered. Coverage on the target was immediately increased and a team of between 20 and 30 analysts in Britain, and two GCHQ officials based in Afghanistan, discovered the target was Camp Bastion. They found the method of attack planned to be remarkably similar to the earlier attack, in which the Taliban broke through the base’s perimeter dressed in American army uniforms in the darkness. Despite wearing training shoes instead of boots and having beards, the coalition forces on the base only realised they were insurgents when they opened fire with rocket-propelled grenades. An earlier assault on Camp Bastion (now empty, pictured) – in September 2012 – cost the lives of two US marines, saw five RAF personnel injured and ended with the destruction of fighter jets worth £130million . In the latest case, as the militants made their way to Camp Bastion, a military operation was authorised that ‘broke up’ the gang before they could kill British and American soldiers. The operation took place in the Washir district in April last year and the Taliban forces were captured, according to the Ministry of Defence. The intelligence operation to stop the attack relied on the ability of GCHQ to access ‘bulk data’ on the internet – a technique that had led to it being accused of conducing ‘mass surveillance’. John Bassett, a former official at the agency, told the Times: ‘This sort of vital operational intelligence can only be achieved through accessing bulk data under the current strict legal environment.’ The access to the data gives GCHQ the ability to search out a needle in a haystack, the agency contends. GCHQ officials played an increasingly important frontline role in Britain’s 13-year war in Afghanistan, earning some 156 campaign service medals. Intelligence officers arrived in Afghanistan shortly after combat troops were sent to help topple the Taliban regime in late 2001. By the peak of the campaign the Afghan mission had become the agency’s second largest task, after counter terrorism. While the bulk of the work was undertaken remotely, the agency benefited from having a number of people on the ground. At any one time it had around 30 staff in the country, backed by a team of around 90 back in the UK. GCHQ operated 10 secret posts inside often remote British military bases across Helmand and the south. Its operations climaxed over the course of 2014, monitoring Taliban communications to thwart plans to hit vulnerable British convoys as they withdrew from bases across Helmand. The agency has flown out more than 400 tons of monitoring and technical equipment as part of the withdrawal. The equipment, equivalent to 100 shipping containers worth, was six times more kit than the agency deployed during Britain’s post-2003 Iraq campaign. At the height of the campaign, when British troops were being killed and mutilated by homemade bombs, GCHQ waged its own battle trying to identify and target commanders smuggling bomb-making equipment into the country from Pakistan. Analysts identified and stopped one commander ferrying more than 15 tonnes of precursor explosives across the border.","GCHQ exposed the plot by monitoring an insurgent and other militants .

"From monkeys swinging in a tree to flying through the air clutching balloons and fishing on a lake, these adorable pictures reveal how these children unleashed their imaginations to create a series of make-believe scenes. The youngsters aged 3-11 had a great time pretending to sit on a school bus, hold a birthday party and eat fruit in a classroom in the arty shots. Photographer 'Admiral' Jan von Holleben, 37, from Germany, came up with the idea for the project and said he hoped the results proved that 'everything is possible'. The three to 11-year-olds had a great time pretending to hold a birthday party and fly through the air . He and the youngsters spent up to an hour arranging the props for each sketch on the floor. It took around 25 photoshoots over 10 months to complete the series. Jan, from Berlin, said: 'I was keen to get the children involved with the making of these photos and worked with them in a big team in a never-ending playground. 'Each shot took from a matter of minutes to an hour to set up, depending on its complexity and the art direction needed. 'We put our heads together to share our creative ideas about adventures, everyday fun, things we want to show off with and anything that tells a really good story. 'We only used everyday objects to create the magic - things from my garage, the cellar, around the house and anything else we could find nearby. A little boy shows off superhuman strength as he lifts up 11 of his friends (l) while another group of tearaways swing off tree branches (r) 'The amount of images we set up was very hard and exhausting. It really pushed me to my limits - physically as well as mentally, but each individual image was very easy and fun to do. 'I sketched out most images on paper or had a solid idea formed in my head. Sometimes it took one to two minutes to bring them to life and even the most difficult only five to 10 minutes maximum to get the final shot. 'Overall the project was very quick and fun to do - but things got hectic as soon as the kids lay in the picture. I love the photos because they prove that everything is possible and nothing is impossible.' von Hollebon has held workshops with children on photographing dreams and is working on a children's book packed with these photos. Kids play by a lake; one is fishing while another rafts. The lake is made of a plastic sheet and fake foliage and rubber ducks are placed nearby . The helium in these balloons must be pretty strong as it's making the children float up into the sky . von Holleben was born in 1977 and grew up in the southern German countryside. He lived most of his youth in an alternative commune and says his photographic style was influenced by his parents, a cinematographer and child therapist. At age 13 he followed his father's career by picking up a camera. After experimenting with all sorts of 'magical tricks' and developing his signature style with the help of friends and family, von Holleben honed his technique in commercial settings. The photographer studied and worked in London for several years before moving to Berlin. von Hollebon has held workshops with children on photographing dreams to help him put the pictures together .

"A Los Angeles County jury has ruled a man should die for the torture killings of a Lancaster woman and her three young daughters. Jurors reached the verdict Tuesday in the case of Corey Lynn King, who was convicted last month of first-degree murder, torture and arson. Prosecutors say 24-year-old King stabbed 43-year-old Sonya Durfield Harris and her 14-year-old daughter more than 50 times each in their home in 2008. Justice served: Corey Lynn King (left), 24, has been sentenced to death for the 2008 torture and murder of 43-year-old Sonya Durfield Harris (right) and her children . He then stabbed, beat and stomped Harris' 11-year-old daughter and strangled her 9-year-old girl. Prosecutors say the motive for killing Harris was unclear, but the girls were slain because they were witnesses. After the killings, King doused the bodies and home with gasoline and set it on fire. He is scheduled to be officially sentenced February 20 in the Antelope Valley courthouse. Corey Lynn King, then 18 years old, surrendered to police on September 10, 2008, a day after firefighters found the bodies of Sonya Durfield Harris and her three daughters, Ebony Horton, 13; Melina Harris, 11; and Kayla Clark, 9, in their burning home in Lancaster, a city about 70 miles north of Los Angeles. The prosecution's complaint filed after King’s arrest charged him with four counts of murder with the special circumstances of multiple murders and torture of the woman and the 13-year-old, district attorney's spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said in a statement. King, of nearby Altadena, was also charged with one count each of arson of an inhabited structure and grand theft auto. Innocent lives: Prosecutors say King stabbed Ebony Horton, 13 (left) over 60 times, stabbed, beat and stomped Melina Harris, 11 (center), and strangled 9-year-old Kayla Clark (right) Sheriff's officials have said King was a friend of the slain woman's 19-year-old son, who lives out of state. A family friend has said King was drinking at the home into the pre-dawn hours before the slayings. In his opening statement in mid-November, Prosecutor Robert Sherwood described for the jury in graphic detail what went on inside Sonya Durfield Harris' home in 1500 block of East Avenue J-3 in Lancaster on the night of the bloody rampage, reported The Antelope Valley News. The mother of three was stabbed 68 times, her throat was slit and her skull was fractured, while her 13-year-old daughter sustained over 60 stab wounds, including seven to her chest. Eleven-year-old Melinda was bashed in the head with a metal pot, and then stomped on the head with such force that a shoe imprint was left on her forehead, the prosecutor said in court. She child was also stabbed at least 12 times. Nine-year-old Kayla’s body was so severely burned that the medical examiner could not determine if she had been stabbed. After the murders, King drove Durfield Harris’ car to a gas station and filled up several bottles with gasoline, prosecutors said. He returned to the home and doused the victims with the gas before setting the entire house on fire. At the time of the killings, King was on parole after pleading guilty in August to misdemeanor petty theft for stealing from a convenience store. The Sheriff's Department said he was in a program that involved working at the Altadena sheriff's station during the day and going home at night. During King’s trial last month, jurors heard evidence about the May 2008 killing of 90-year-old Evelyn Mosely, whose body was found in a pool of blood on the kitchen floor of her fire-ravaged home in Altadena. King was named a ‘person of interest’ in the slaying at the time, but he has never been charged with the woman’s death.","Corey Lynn King was convicted last month of first-degree murder, torture and arson in September 2008 murders .

"A five-year-old boy has been left with horrific injuries after being knocked onto a concrete floor by a middle-aged woman during the post-Christmas shopping frenzy. Three days after Christmas, Dale Atkinson, 34, was shopping in the middle of a busy Rebel Sport in Macarthur Square Shopping Centre, in South-west Sydney, with his partner and son, Ryan. 'Ryan ran up to me and was crying, and said that someone had bumped into him,' Dale told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Ryan Atkinson, 5, suffered horrific injuries when he was knocked over by a middle-aged lady in the middle of a Rebel Sports during post-Christmas sales . 'I looked at him and couldn't see anything wrong, and told him to shake it off, but then I brushed his hair back and saw a huge lump on his forehead,' Dale said. Five-year-old Ryan, who had been trailing behind Dale and his partner, had been knocked flat onto the carpet of the store, which thinly covered the concrete underneath that had taken the full force of his little head. 'He had been playing a game on my phone, which meant that he didn't have his arms free to break his fall,' said Dale, a horticulturalist from Narrelan Vale in NSW. 'I went up to the staff and asked what had happened, and they said that a lady had come up to them at the checkout. She told them that she had bumped into a child and fallen onto him, but that she had just got up and left,' he said. Ryan's head knocked onto the concrete floor of the store, resulting in a two centimetre raised lump . Ryan's father Dale said that Ryan's mother was so terrified that he'd cracked his skull that they drove 45 minutes away to Wollongong Hospital . 'I was just shocked. I was completely mortified that a lady could fall on a child and not even pull up and check whether he was ok, not even apologise.' 'She just got up and left. I don't understand how someone could do that.' Dale said that the lump began to swell immediately, blowing up to a raised two centimetre bump which extended from under his nose to around his eyes, covering his forehead. Ryan had his face painted in the spirit of Christmas festivities, makeup which Dale said melted off with his tears. 'It just progressively got worse, darkening and swelling until he could barely see out of his eyes,' Dale said. 'The staff at Rebel Sport were amazing, really caring. They ran to get him an ice pack, and lollies, and filed an incident report right away.' Ryan's mother, Meg Owen-Maisson, 30, drove her son 45 minutes to Wollongong Hospital to have scans, as 'we thought he might have cracked his skull,' said Dale. 'Luckily he was physically fine, no broken bones, but I could barely look at him because his injuries were so terrifying.' Dale (left) a horticuluralist, said that Ryan (right) is normally a very active boy with no fear . Dale Atkinson (far right), with his partner Elizabeth Huemer (far left), and her daughter Eliana Huemer (right), with Dale's sons Harry (middle) and Ryan (right) Ryan, pictured here accepting his preschool diploma, turned five on Christmas Eve . Dale and his family are determined to find the woman that knocked over Ryan, and to make her apologise to him for all the harm she caused. 'His mum was bawling her eyes out when she saw him, she's been an absolute wreck,' Dale said. 'I would just like to find the lady, make her understand what happened to my son,' he said. 'He was so traumatised by it that when we went back the next day to say thank you to the staff I had to carry him into the store because he was afraid he would be knocked over again.' Dale said that Rebel Sport had treated the family with utter kindness, launching an investigation and following up on Ryan in the days after the incident to see how he was faring. 'When we went back in they asked him to pick out some toys, and let him have them for free. They've been so caring and that's the one positive thing that has come out of this,' Dale said. Dale and his family are determined to find the woman that knocked over Ryan, and to make her apologise to him for all the harm she caused . Dale said Ryan had been 'tough as nails', and that despite his injuries was in high spirits . While the staff at Rebel Sport checked CCTV footage in an attempt to identify the woman, the area where the incident happened was in the camera security's blind spot. 'It's so heartless what she did, she knew what had happened, she reported it to staff, but didn't say anything to him,' Dale said. 'One of my friends started crying when she saw his injuries, and one of my partner's daughters nearly threw up. It brought back memories of being beaten,' he said. 'That's the terrifying thing. I can't believe that injuries my son has reminds someone of being hurt. It looks like I've beaten him, people stare everywhere we go because he looks like a victim of abuse.' Dale said Ryan, who turned five on Christmas Eve, had been 'tough as nails', and that despite his injuries was in high spirits. 'It's only when he looks in the mirror and realises that he doesn't look like himself anymore that he gets upset,' said Dale. 'He's still a bit wary and that breaks my heart because it's his birthday party this week. I can't believe he has to celebrate looking the way he does.' Dale said that Ryan is a very active boy, who loves running around and has no fear, but that hasn't stopped Dale from feeling scared for his little boy. 'I'm pretty shaken up about it. Even now it gives me chills, I get teary just talking about it,' Dale said. 'I just can't believe that three days after Christmas someone would do that to a little boy. Where is your spirit? Do you not have compassion?'","Dale Atkinson was shopping in a busy Rebel Sport store with his partner and son, five-year-old Ryan .

"Barely a decade ago it was at the bottom of the heap. Highbury Grove School had some of the worst exam results and truancy rates in the country and undercover filming shown on TV featured scenes of shocking behaviour – including a lesson descending into a riot. But now the North London comprehensive has marked an extraordinary transformation after being hailed as one of Britain’s best state schools by the high society magazine Tatler. Highbury Grove School in Islington, pictured, is now one of the most successful state schools in England . The school, pictured, has been turned around according to a survey by Tatler magazine . For the second year running, the magazine has produced a guide to state schools amid concerns that readers are finding it increasingly hard to afford private education. Until 2014, the magazine only produced a guide to the country’s leading fee-paying schools, but now Tatler sends out teams to find the ‘very best of the state education system’. Highbury Grove is among 22 state secondaries featured, taking its place alongside top-performing grammars and the girls’ comprehensive chosen by former education secretary Michael Gove for his daughter. Tatler details how the school is now ‘the big noise’ around Islington. Five years ago, it says, a group of mothers banded together and presented the then head with a wish list which included Latin lessons and better music tuition. Now the school is ‘transformed’ with a ‘brilliant new head’ who is keen on ‘impeccable behaviour’ and ‘details’ including top buttons being done up at all times. Its music programme is backed by Lord Lloyd-Webber, and offers every 11 to 14-year-old free tuition on an instrument. It marks an astonishing turnaround for a school whose low point came in 2005 when Channel Four’s Dispatches sent an undercover teacher to film in classrooms as part of an investigation into education standards. The footage shows pupils clambering across desks, throwing books across the room, taking a fire extinguisher off the wall and attacking each other. A member of staff said at the time that they didn’t ‘make a big thing’ about enforcing rules. The school was founded in the 1960s under head Rhodes Boyson, who went on to become a Tory MP and education minister. Then all-boys, it was conceived as a comprehensive that would serve as a ‘grammar school for all’. It thrived from the outset but by the 1980s, Boyson had departed and a belief in progressive teaching methods had taken hold. In 1991, inspectors highlighted bad behaviour and unsatisfactory lessons. Former head Truda White was credited with turning the school around, culminating in a 2010 Ofsted report which described it as ‘outstandingly effective’. ‘Attainment has risen rapidly in recent years from a low starting point to close to the national average’, the report said, adding the transformation is ‘remarkable’. Tatler notes that the institute is now attracting parents who would have previously shunned state education, meaning it now has a ‘properly comprehensive’ intake. As well as the music programme, there is ‘an amazing gym, a swimming pool and good pitches and running tracks’, according to the complimentary write-up. Meanwhile the school website now features a clear list of rules and sanctions for breaching them. Other schools in the guide include The Grey Coat Hospital School, a Westminster comprehensive chosen by Mr Gove for his daughter.","Tatler has rated Highbury Grove School as one of England's best .

"A Harley Street doctor who provoked fury after going on an elephant-hunting trip to Africa has been arrested on suspicion of writing fake invoices to insurance firms. Dr Benjamin Chang, 54, from north London, is alleged to have written the bogus accident treatment claims for physiotherapy patients. Detectives interviewed the orthopaedic specialist in November this year. Officers reportedly raided his private surgery and his £1.1m detached home in north London  in connection to the allegation. Dr Benjamin Chang, 54, pictured, shot this lioness while on safari in Zimbabwe in 2008 . Dr Benjamin Chang, 54, is alleged to have written the bogus accident treatment claims in a bid to sting insurance firms. He is pictured in 2009 sitting on top of an elephant he killed in Zimbabwe . The doctor, who was born in Hong Kong, sparked controversy in 2009 when he was photographed giving the thumbs up while sitting on the head of an elephant he had just shot in Zimbabwe. The animal was reported to be one of three elephants he killed after paying £5,600 to take part in the shoot. Seperately, he was pictured with a dead lioness he had killed in South Africa. Dr Chang was part of a hunting party visiting the Hwange national park who culled a herd of 11 elephants, including young calves. The cull took place in areas where elephants are said to be destroying the environment and was permitted by the Zimbabwean government. Most of the money was passed on to the Zimbabwean park authorities. At the time, he defended killing the elephants, insisting it helped the Zimbabwean people and was the most humane method of killing. He added that the elephant meat was donated to starving villagers. He told the Times: ‘The meat goes to the village. They are queuing at the camp saying, ""Please give us the meat"". I was told one elephant will feed one village for three and a half months.’ The orthopaedic specialist had consulting rooms in London's highly-respected Harley Street (pictured) He also defended the practice of foreigners paying to kill elephants, saying that the army did not have the necessary guns to shoot the animals. Dr Chang, who trained as a doctor in Ireland, was arrested in November by City of London Police on suspicion of fraud by false representation. He is listed as the director of the Milton Medical Centre in Luton, the headquarters of which is said to be in Kenley, Surrey. His wife Corrina Chang is listed as the company secretary. Dr Chang, who also had consulting rooms in London's Harley Street, is registered with the General Medical Council but has not had a licence to practise since August. A City of London Police spokesman said: ‘Insurance Fraud Enforcement Department detectives investigating the supply of what are suspected to be fake invoices for physiotherapy treatment arrested a 54-year-old man from north London on suspicion of fraud by false representation. ‘He was released on police bail and is due to return in March 2015.’ MailOnline has contacted Dr Chang but he was not available for comment.

"A homeless man who received a surprise meal and hotel stay after spending a $100 donation on food for his friends has insisted that no part of the experience was a hoax - despite the fact one witness is claiming the whole thing was a set-up. The man - named only as Thomas - had been filmed living on the streets of California, before being taken to a sushi restaurant, given a hotel room with  hot tub and treated to a new suit and haircut . But the resulting video posted online by 'serial prankster' Josh Paler Lin was met with varying degrees of skepticism, with a number of viewers dismissing it as a hoax. One witness, in particular, has insisted that there was no way that Thomas did not know he was being filmed as in the original video he arrived at the liquor store in the same car as Paler Lin. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Smartened up: In Josh Paler Lin's newsest video, homeless Thomas, who became an internet hit after spending a $100 donation on food for his friends, is given a new suit and a makeover . Nursing student Taugan Tan Kadalim, 26, told Vocativ that he was outside the liquor store on the day in question and he saw Paler Lin - who is recognized from his previous videos - in the driver's seat. In the passenger seat, he claims, was Thomas. Kadalim told the site: 'While I think the guy is homeless, it is clear that from what I saw every part of that scene was staged.' However, Thomas has now spoken to Fox LA, insisting that to him it was 'all a surprise' and he had never met Josh before he was handed the $100. He told the news channel: 'I appreciate it, most definitely. It's all a surprise to me. I thought this was just a project video, I had no idea this was going where it went. Thomas added: 'Normally people give you a dollar, maybe five as a big tip, but a hundred, wow that's a week's worth. Crazy.' Paler Lin had initially set out to 'expose homeless people' in Los Angeles by giving them cash in the expectation that they will spend it on alcohol. However, Thomas proved to be an exception. Instead, he spent the money on food to share with his friends, prompting Paler Lin to return and surprise Thomas with a Christmas meal, makeover and a night in a hotel. Gesture... with an agenda? Skeptics have picked holes in a viral video showing a homeless man spending a $100 donation on food for his beggar friends, deeming it a 'fake' creation that was focused on making money . The feel-good videos, that have gained more than 26million views, are part of a campaign to raise more than $120,000, via an Indiegogo page for Thomas to get his life back on track. But critics pointed to a number of apparent flaws in the footage, as well as the hefty profit Paler Lin has reportedly made from its success - up to a huge $52,000 . YouTube users have been skeptical about Paler Lin's motivation, suggesting it is a 'set-up' so he can gain traffic and profit. One YouTube user, with the handle ClemtheRanter, said: 'A large number of YouTube prank videos are staged,' he said. 'I was involved in a bloody eyeball scare prank by Josh Paler Lin. My part of the video was staged... me getting scared by Josh. Using chopsticks: Lin captioned this photo of Thomas:  'Taking Thomas to eat Shabu Shabu in this Xmas eve' Twist: The short film sees 'serial prankster' Josh Paler Lin give $100 to a beggar named Thomas in Los Angeles, California - only for him to walk into a Liquor Mart (left) and buy food for his struggling friends (right) 'I asked him if he could give me a shout-out and put my name in the description below so I can get some traffic to my YouTube channel, but it never happened. 'So now i'm addressing this issue due to a number of YouTube pranksters getting exposed for making stage pranks.' Other users have claimed that homeless feel-good films are a sure-fire way of boosting traffic - and consequently, money, via advertisements - on the social networking site. 'They go to a homeless person and make a feel-good video because they know that's going to get views,' said one YouTube user, referring to the site's personalities, such as Paler Lin. Skepticism: Now, viewers have questioned the video's authenticity, citing a number of 'flaws' in the footage. Above, Lin is pictured in a Facebook photo. He is well-known for producing 'prank' videos for YouTube . Indeed, in November 2013, Paler Lin gave another homeless man $100 and told an actor playing a beggar to approach him to ask for money for food. Again, the real beggar handed over some cash. The user, with the handle '24/7 rants', claimed the start of Paler Lin's recent homeless video - which sees the director hand Thomas $100, before secretly following him with a camera - immediately suggests it may be a hoax. Speaking in his own video, he said Paler Lin could not possibly have guaranteed the man was going to pick up his things and spend the money immediately, instead of remaining by the roadside. 'How did he know he was going to spend the money immediately? He had no idea,' he said. He also picked holes in the claim that Thomas did not notice the camera - nor Paler Lin (who has a distinctive haircut) - following him throughout the duration of his trip to a nearby Liquor Mart. After shopping at the Mart, Thomas was filmed emerging with bags filled with food, before going straight to a park, where he handed out the goods to a number of homeless people. Wit his new look and wardrobe, Thomas was treated to a buffet meal at the end of the day by Paler Lin . However, the user questioned the beggar's choice of a Liquor Mart a 34-minute walk away for his food shop - instead of a nearer, cheaper supermarket - saying: 'It seems like an odd coincidence'. 'Why would this guy, of all places, go to a liquor store to buy chips and pie or whatever when you think that there are tons of other places to go to... that are convenient, probably cheaper. However, Paler Lin argued that Thomas chose the liqour store because it was closest to his begging spot, saying: 'When people see you getting all this traffic they want to bring you down.' When questioned by DailyMail.com, he did not explain why Thomas chose to drag several bags of food 34 minutes to the park, instead of shopping at least two stores that were closer to the park. But he strongly denied staging any of his films or having met Thomas before the $100 exchange. 'I had little expectation, maybe he would buy alcohol maybe he wouldn't,' he said of the video. 'I wanted to see what a homeless person would spend it on. No one has ever done that before.' Giving: The camera following Thomas as he hands food to a family in the park he was initially filmed in . However, the YouTube user claimed the number of hits received by Paler Lin's previous YouTube videos - between 600,000 to 800,000, according to socialblade.com, a site that tracks YouTube channel statistics - could have prompted him to construct what he knew would be a viral hit. Indeed, Paler Lin - who earns money based on how many users view his videos, most of which are 'pranks' - not only scooped $52,000 from the film, but also gained 13,000 new subscribers. After the video went viral, Paler Lin said on YouTube: 'I wasn't expecting to get this kind of footage. To be honest, I thought this video would be more an exposing homeless people video at first.' He added: 'I'm so glad that I could witness and capture such a beautiful moment. This has to be one of the most amazing experience so far on this channel. In the footage, Thomas told Paler Lin he had quit his job to look after his parents, but after both of them died, he couldn't afford to pay for their condo and found himself on the street. 'The more I talk to him, the more I sense how genuine he is…. I gave him my number and told him to call me when he needs help. Never judge a book by its cover. One love!' Paler Lin said. Another video: In November 2013, Lin (pictured, left) gave another homeless man (right) $100 and told an actor playing a beggar to approach him to ask for money for food. The video gained far fewer views than Thomas's .","YouTube star Josh Paler Lin filmed himself giving beggar Thomas, $100 .

"Harry Soames, 29, from Notting Hill, London, has been banned from driving after crashing his BMW while twice over the legal drink-drive limit . The son of Tory MP Sir Nicholas Soames crashed his BMW while still almost double the drink-drive limit the morning after drinking a mixture of wine and vodka cocktails, a court has heard. Harry Soames, 29, from Notting Hill, London, was arrested after his vehicle spun out of control on the M23 near Crawley and collided into the central reservation. The crash took place less than eight hours after Soames had stopped drinking at his father's home in Handcross, West Sussex. Appearing in the dock at Crawley Magistrates' Court today, Soames - who is also the great-grandson of Winston Churchill - admitted he had been 'frightened' by the ordeal and said that ht was 'truly sorry'. Soames, the eldest son of the Tory Mid Sussex MP, pleaded guilty to driving while over the legal limit. He said: 'I am deeply and truly sorry for the incident that occurred, and I'm greatly relieved that no one was injured. 'It was a profoundly frightening experience which I never wish to repeat, and one in which I have learnt valuable lessons. 'Unfortunately, there was an error of judgement approximately seven hours after I stopped drinking. 'I did not knowingly get behind the wheel of the vehicle drunk, nor would I ever do so.' The court heard how, after the crash, Soames drove over to the hard shoulder. He was then arrested following a roadside breath test which revealed he had 56 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath in his system. The legal limit of 35. Prosecuting, Martina Sherlock said: 'On November 29 just before 7.50am, it seems Mr Soames was driving a BMW on the M23 northbound near Crawley, close to Junction 10. 'There was a road traffic collision whereby he crashed into the central reservation; there were no other vehicles involved. 'The car he was driving spun out of control and once it came to a stop he managed to get over to the hard shoulder. '15 minutes later police arrived at the scene, having been called. Mr Soames admitted being the driver of the vehicle at the time. 'A roadside breath test was required of him due to the collision and it tested positive for the presence of alcohol. He was subsequently arrested.' In police interview, Soames, who works for a security company, said he misjudged moving across the lanes of the motorway. The driver (left), the son of Tory MP Nicholas Soames (right), crashed on the M23 near Crawley after consuming a mix of wine and vodka cocktails . He is also the great-grandson of wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill (pictured) Ms Sherlock added: 'He says he stopped drinking at 12.30am that morning. However, prior to that, he had a few glasses of wine and a few vodka cocktails at his father's house in Handcross.' The defendant already had three penalty points on his licence after being convicted of using a mobile phone while driving in January 2013. Sentencing him to a 12-month disqualification, chair of magistrates Ron Adams said: 'It's clear that you are deeply in remorse and ashamed of what you have done, and to some extent surprised that the alcohol stayed in your body for that period of time. 'It does show, however, that alcohol can affect the actions of a driver, and in this case you were lucky that neither yourself or any other road user was seriously injured in this matter. It could have been so much worse.' Soames agreed to take part in a drink-drive course which, if he completes successfully, will reduce his ban by three months. He was also fined £300, and ordered to pay £85 in costs and a £15 victim surcharge. People are more cautious than ever about drink-driving - but most people are unaware that even three glasses of wine could mean you are over the limit the following morning. Alcohol is absorbed directly into the bloodstream from the stomach and the small intestine and is carried to the liver. Among its many other jobs, the liver acts as a filter to remove poisons from the body. The liver produces chemicals called enzymes, which break the alcohol down into other chemicals. These, in turn, are broken down, until all that is left is carbon dioxide and water, which pass out of the body in urine. It takes about an hour for the body to process a unit of alcohol - but there are numerous factors which can affect this (picture posed by model) This generally takes about an hour for every unit of alcohol. To play it safe, it's best to start counting from the time you finish drinking. For example, if you have 20 units of alcohol and stop drinking at midnight, it's going to be 8pm the following day before it is out of your system. If you drink three 250 ml glasses of 14 per cent strength wine (10.5 units) and call it a night at midnight, in theory it will be 10.30 the next morning before you are no longer under the influence. But this rate can vary depending on factors including weight, gender and medication in your system. Liver disease expert Dr Nick Sheron, head of population hepatology at the University of Southampton, warns there is a range of complicating factors that can play havoc with the one-hour-per-unit calculation. He said it makes any attempt to work out when it might be safe to drive the following day a dangerous lottery. For a start, he says, blood alcohol is determined by your body fat distribution and weight: fatter people actually have less water content in their body. Water in the body helps to dilute alcohol - hence the blood alcohol level would be more concentrated and higher in an overweight person than in a person of normal weight. Women also have lower levels of a chemical called alcohol dehydrogenase - an enzyme that breaks down alcohol in the liver - so it takes a woman longer than a man to get the same amount of alcohol out of her bloodstream. Medication can also complicate things. Aspirin and birth control pills, for example, interfere with the liver's ability to break down alcohol, slowing the process.","Harry Soames, 29, collided into central reservation on M23 near Crawley .

"A Czech photographer has come face to face with some of the country's most dangerous killers and turned their mugs into art. Radek Kalhous was allowed inside a notorious maximum-security prison the Hradec Králové Region in the northern parts of the Czech Republic where he captured eleven convicted murderers. The chilling portraits include Radim Odehnal who invited a young couple into his home only to bludgeon the man to death with a hammer, and proceed to cook his flesh on a garden grill while raping the woman. Murderer: Jaroslav Stodola brutally murdered and robbed eight pensioners alongside his wife Dana . Pure evil: Radim Odehnal  invited a young couple into his house before killing the man with a heavy hammer and raping the girl four times while burning her boyfriend's flesh on a nearby garden grill .

Another killer depicted is Jaroslav Stodola who brutally murdered and robbed eight pensioners alongside his wife Dana Stodolova. Tomas Vit was just 18 years old when he was sentenced to life behind bars for killing his two elderly neighbours. Vit had knocked on their door to ask for a painkiller, and when they OAP couple refused to help him he killed them using a hammer and knife. He is the youngest person in recent history to be sentenced to life in prison  in the Czech Republic. The images were taken at Valdice, a former Cartusian monastery, housing almost 2,000 inmates serving longer sentences.

He added: 'Eventually twelve murderers agreed and I chose 11 of them. 'The conditions were poor. Tiny interrogation room with white walls, bars in the middle. Unpleasant light from the fluorescent tube. 'A few guards, prison educators, secretary plus ten other people. And me and the camera. Then they kept coming in, one after another. I had ten minutes for each one.' 'The shooting took two hours and fifteen minutes. Then I got into my car and just stared into the space in front of me for almost one hour.

"King Abdullah bin Abdulziz of Saudi Arabia has been admitted to hospital for medical tests. The 90-year-old king is undergoing tests at the National Guard's King Abdulaziz Medical City hospital in the capital Riyadh, a royal statement said. King Abdullah  has ruled Saudi Arabia since 2005, but has been absent from public events in recent months due to his ill health . In hospital: King Abdullah bin Abdulziz, 90, has ruled Saudi Arabia since 2005, but has been absent from public events in recent months due to his ill health . Just last week, the king had left the capital city to spend time at the royal encampment in Rawdat Khuraim, a green oasis about 62 miles north of Riyadh. It was at the resort that the monarch met US President Barack Obama in March and appeared before the press wearing an oxygen tube. Official photographs of the king have also shown him in a wheelchair. The health of the monarch is watched closely since any changes in leadership could have an impact on the stability of one of the world's largest oil producers. Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy with no elected parliament. The king has sole power to ratify legislation and appoint ministers. The king reportedly underwent surgery in October 2011 and November 2012 for his back at the same hospital he was admitted to today. He also had two back surgeries in 2010 in New York. Absolute monarchy: The health of King Abdullah, pictured in 2006, is watched closely since any changes in leadership could have an impact on the stability of Saudi Arabia . His 79-year-old successor and half-brother, Crown Prince Salman, has increasingly represented the kingdom in meetings abroad, including the latest Gulf summit in Qatar this month. As deputy prime minister and defence minister, he has also increasingly presided over cabinet meetings at home. The king's latest hospitalisation comes as Saudi Arabia holds a high-profile position in the US-led fight against the Islamic State group, which has seized swathes of neighbouring Iraq and Syria. Saudi warplanes have joined in coalition air strikes against the jihadists in Syria, although the ultra-conservative Muslim kingdom has faced calls to do more to halt the flow of funds and fighters to IS from among its own citizens. The king has outlived two other half-brothers who held the crown prince post. Under his guidance, a council comprised of the sons and some grandsons of modern Saudi Arabia's founder, King Abdul-Aziz Al Saud, was activated and in March selected King Abdullah's half-brother Prince Muqrin, 69, as second-in-line to the throne. The king officially assumed the throne in 2005, becoming the sixth king of Saudi Arabia, but had been widely viewed as the de facto ruler since the mid-1990s. As king, he holds the post of prime minister and commander of the National Guard.","King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, 90, has been admitted to hospital .

"The number of cinema tickets bought in the United States in 2014 fell to its lowest level in nearly 20 years - despite the fact that the box office raked in more than $10 billion. Some 1.259 billion tickets were bought in the past year, the lowest number since 1995 when 1.211 billion people went to the cinema. The figure is down six per cent on the 1.34 billion tickets that were sold in 2013, meaning that 81 million people who went to the cinema last year chose not to in 2014. Guardians Of The Galaxy was the number one film at the US box office in 2014 with ticket sales of $332.8m . The statistics, reported by Deadline, include January 1-December 31. Movie distribution chiefs have put the disappointing sales down to distractions such as video games, the increase in viral videos and online streaming sites such as Netflix. But despite relatively low ticket sales in 2014, as of last weekend six studios had made in excess of $1billion this year, including Fox, Disney, Warner Bros, Sony, Paramount and Universal. In fact, 2014 is the sixth year in a row to pass the $10billion mark and this year's takings are currently three per cent higher than 2011. 1. Guardians of the Galaxy ($332.8m) 2. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay ($306.7m) 3. Captain America: The Winter Soldier ($259.8m) 4. The LEGO Movie ($257.8m) 5. Transformers: Age of Extinction ($245.4m) 6.

Amazing Spider-Man 2 ($202.9m) 10. Godzilla ($200.7m) This week, figures from Box Office Mojo, reported that Guardians Of The Galaxy was the number one film at the US box office in 2014 with ticket sales of $332.8 million. The Marvel space adventure starring Chris Pratt, 35, as Peter Quill and his alter-ego Star-Lord was released on August 1 and was the first film to pass the $300 million mark this year. The film, also starring Zoe Saldana, Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper, was a  a risk for Marvel as it centered on lesser known comic book characters but it found an eager audience. It was followed closely in second place by The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1, which remains in theaters and has taken in a haul to date of $306.7 million. The film's star Jennifer Lawrence popped up again in the seventh-place finisher X-Men Days Of Future Past which earned $233.9 million. The 24-year-old actress last week was named the highest-grossing actor in Hollywood in 2014 with her films taking in $1.4 billion at the worldwide box office. Marvel also landed the third-highest grossing movie of the year with Captain America: The Winter Soldier starring Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson and Sebastian Stan earning $259.8 million domestically.

"A wildlife photographer has captured amazing photos of polar bears who appear to be doing their own rendition of the waltz or playing a game of patty-cake. The massive bears went paw-to-paw while standing on their hind legs on the frozen tundra in Churchill, Manitoba, on the southern edge of Canada’s Arctic. While it looks like the juvenile males were practising fancy footwork they were actually play fighting as a horde of camera-happy tourists looked on. These polar bears aren't ballroom dancing - they are play fighting in front of tourists in the northern town of Churchill, Manitoba in Canada . The amusing moment was captured by tourist Alex Berger, 28, while he visited the town on the western shore of Hudson Bay, which bills itself as the Polar Bear Capital of the World. He was travelling in a Tundra Buddy, a custom-built coach designed to transport tourists across the frozen ground, when the two bears appeared. The encounter lasted for around 30 minutes before the animals went their separate ways. Alex, from Copenhagen, Denmark, said: ‘On the third day of the trip the tour bus pulled up and we saw a group of bears play fighting with each other. Photographer Alex Berger, from Copenhagen, Denmark, said the bears wrestled for 30 minutes before going their separate ways . ‘Two of the bears, who I believe were juvenile males, started coming closer to us and then stopped about 30 feet away. ‘They then began playing fighting again but from some angles it almost looked like they were ballroom dancing. ‘They did this for about 20 minutes before eventually walking away and giving each other some space. ‘Although polar bears like to play fight it is very easy for them to overheat so they don't have these battles for very long at a time.' Tourists snapped photos from the safety of a Tundra Buggy, a custom-built coach designed to transport tourists across the frozen tundra . He added: ‘Part of me was concerned that after travelling all that way I may only see one bear lying down or something, but I was amazed to photograph something like this. It was fantastic.’ Polar bears are the world’s largest land predators and they migrate to Northern Manitoba every autumn to wait for ice to form on the sea. They spend many months of the year at sea and they prey mainly on seals but will also devour animal carcasses and fish.","Photographer Alex Bergen captured the amusing moment while visiting Churchill, Manitoba with other tourists .

"Silas Richardson, 84, is accused of stabbing to death his 87-year-old brother . Authorities say an 84-year-old Maryland man has been charged with fatally stabbing his older brother. Cecil County Sheriff's Office spokesman Lt. Michael Holmes says deputies found the body of 87-year-old George Carlton Richardson Sr. on Monday night. Holmes says the body was in the backyard of the Conowingo home of Silas D. Richardson. Deputies say Silas Richardson went to his brother's home Monday in Neptune Township, New Jersey, and told the man's girlfriend that George Richardson had died but he gave no details. The girlfriend said became suspicious when she saw Silas driving his older brother's car because he never allowed anyone to drive the vehicle, reports WBAL. Deputies then went to Silas' home to check things out. They reportedly detected a strong smell of bleach and found blood inside the home. Police soon found George's body covered up in the back of Richardson's home. Holmes said the deceased brother had gone to the Maryland home to help out after the younger brother's wife died last week. It was unclear when he arrived. Neptune Township police took Richardson into custody with plans to extradite him to Cecil County on first- and second-degree murder charges, robbery, theft over $10,000, reckless endangerment and assault, WBAL reports.","Silas D.

"A father-of-one is fighting for his life in hospital after a backyard firework exploded in his face during New Year's Eve celebrations. Adrian Alafaci, 28, was at Sans Souci in Sydney's south with friends and family on the coast when tragedy struck. Alafaci, the father of a little girl, suffered horrific facial and head injuries. He remains in a critical condition at St George's Hospital following the serious accident which occurred when he attempted to light a firecracker. Just after 12am on New Year's Day police were called to Sans Souci in Sydney's south following reports of a man injured on the beach. Police told Daily Mail Australia 'he's not well at all' after Alafaci suffered facial and head injuries. NSW Police media ‘could not confirm that a home made firework was  used during the incident, as that information forms part of the ongoing investigation.’ Scroll down for video . Adrian Alafaci, 28, (right) is in a critical condition after an accident on New Year's Eve with an exploding firework. He is pictured with his wife . Another victim on the Central Coast was flown to hospital with similar injuries to his face and head, also inflicted by a firework on New Year's Eve . Bob Buffoni, a resident who lives on Riverside Drive overlooking the beach, heard and saw the distressing accident. “We heard the bang and the flash together, it was really loud,' he told news.com.au . He described the pandemonium, with people running and screaming, calling for ambulances and explaining that 'there is so much blood'. He insists it had now been a troublesome party before the incident. Another neighbour, Angela Lirantzis, describes seeing 'the guy being taken on a stretcher in a bad way.' Relatives were screaming that he had been burnt. Meanwhile, police are investigating after a 21-year-old man also suffered facial injuries from a firework explosion in a separate incident on New Year's Eve on NSW's Central Coast. Adrian Alafaci, 28, (right) is in a critical condition. He is the father of a young daughter . The incident happened in Sans Souci in Sydney's south on this road, Riverside Drive . Police were called to the scene at 10.15pm and the patient was treated at the scene. He was transported via Ambulance Helicopter from  Shelly Beach area with burns and other injuries to his face and is receiving further treatment at Royal North Shore Hospital. His injuries are not life-threatening. Police from Tuggerah Lakes Local Area Command are investigating the circumstances surrounding the incident and are urging anyone with information to come forward. Three people were treated by paramedics after two separate fireworks accidents in Victoria as people saw in the New Year. In the most serious incident a man aged in his 20s suffered injuries when a fire cracker was lit in Fitzroy in Melbourne's CBD. 'Paramedics were told a fire cracker the man was holding ignited, and shot up his shirt sleeve causing an injury and burns to his armpit,' Ambulance Commander Anthony De Wit said. 'He was treated by paramedics and taken to Royal Melbourne Hospital in a stable condition. Two teenage girls in Lorne were also injured when illegal fireworks were detonated in Lorne, 140 kilometres south west of Melbourne. 31 people were arrested in Sydney's CBD with more than 3000 police officers deployed in the area . The two girls, aged 15 and 16, were sitting on the beach with friend when, according to Victoria Police, an 'unknown offender' ignited the fireworks at about 11.10pm. Both girls suffered from burns, with the 15-year-old from Malvern transported to Geelong Hospital with burns to her leg. The 16-year-old girl from Bentleigh was treated at the scene. Police are investigating the incident and urge witnesses to contact Crime Stoppers with any information about the events. In a separate incident, a 17-year-old from Cantebury allegedly detonated fireworks and has been charged with conduct endangering person and other related offences.","Adrian Alafaci, 28, fighting for life after fireworks exploded in his face .

"Nina Parsons is set to undergo surgery in the US after well-wishers raised  £70,000 . A young woman whose brain stem is being gradually crushed by her skull is set to undergo life changing surgery. Nina Parsons' suffers from Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, which is causing her head to sink into her neck. Her condition is so severe that she has shrunk an inch and a half in the last two years - dropping from 5ft 5½in to just 5ft 4in. The rare agonising condition, which weakens the collagen in her body, means that the former make-up artist spends most of the day confined to her bed. However, she is now set to have  specialist fusion surgery in the US after well-wishers raised £70,000 to fund the operation. 'The treatment I need to make me better is not available in this country, the skills are just not there,' said Miss Parsons, from Stapenhill, Staffordshire. 'Through the campaign some amazing companies and people have come forward to help and I say a huge 'thank you' to them all. She told how she has lost her home, business and partner because of the illness, which leaves her in constant pain. 'The long-term prognosis is deterioration resulting in seizures drop attacks and eventually paralysis. 'The smallest journey is living hell, inflicting vibration and jarring to my body, so even hospital appointments are huge pain filled ordeals.' 'I wear a cervical collar a large proportion of the time to enforce restricted movements. Sudden movement and over stressing my ligaments and joints could be catastrophic. Nina Parsons suffers from Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, which is so severe she spends most of the day confined to her bed . Nina Parsons pictured with her parents John and Jill at their home in Staffordshire . 'As a young confident woman in her twenties, I had built a successful beauty business that was going from strength to strength. 'But I was unable to sustain the rigorous demands required to run a business and had to let it go. 'This in turn also meant the loss of my home and my livelihood. 'I was engaged for two years but the relationship also succumbed to the stress and demands of my illness and we separated. 'I am now all but housebound and live with my hugely supportive parents. Miss Parsons believes that the surgery is  her 'last and only chance' 'Even within a home environment it is almost impossible to undertake or do day-to-day tasks most of us take for granted. 'This is due to almost 24 hour pain, severe migraines, neurological problems, not being able to focus or move my eyes, numbness, weakness, pain that radiates from behinds my eyes and the back of the skull, from my neck into my shoulders and arms and further down my spine. 'To compound the problem, my solace from pain relief is compromised as I have an allergic reaction to morphine and many opiates. My body is slowly closing down and many of my waking hours I am confined to my bed.' EDS affects one in 5,000 people in the UK and renders itself very differently in each individual. 'Despite not knowing for years, I was actually born with EDS and lived with it my entire life. 'It meant for many of my early years I would bruise very easily, suffer dislocations and other injures that, at the time, went unexplained. 'It was when I hit the age of 23 that serious problems started to manifest and knew that I would have to seek out help and advice from doctors and consultants. 'However, my diagnosis was very vague and put my problems down to a range of issues from anxiety to psychological issues. 'I was offered counselling and anti-depressants at the time but knew that this would not solve the problem. 'I carried on as I was until I was around 26 when the situation became quite serious and I began to suffer from quite serious sickness and nausea. 'My weight dropped dramatically and my hair began to fall out as I could no longer eat solid food. Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is a collection of inherited conditions, known as heritable disorders of connective tissue. Connective tissues provide support in skin, tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, internal organs and bones. There are different types of EDS, which can cause: . The fragile skin and unstable joints may be the result of faulty collagen. Collagen is a protein in connective tissue that acts as a 'glue' in the body, adding strength and elasticity. The different types of EDS are caused by alterations in certain genes that make collagen weaker. In some cases the amount of collagen in the body is reduced. The faulty genes can be passed from parents to their children. Source: NHS Choices . 'Then, soon after, issues started to emerge regarding my movement, vision and then vertigo set in.' Nina decided to carry on with her work as a make-up artist for brides but it was when she reached the age of 28 that her life and health took a dramatic turn for the worse. 'I fell down the stairs and suffered a whiplash injury to my neck. I also had major damage to ligaments and bones,' she added. 'I started to suffer excruciating migraines and constant headaches that have not stopped since. 'This was when I was formally diagnosed with EDS. My lust for life has drained from me.' Miss Parsons was left shell shocked by the diagnoses and pain and suffering that came with it but she was defiant that she would beat this problem, only to learn that salvation would be hard to come by. The nature of EDS frequently leads to other related illnesses such as Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) and Craniocervical Instability (CCI). 'CCI manifestations are complex, it is often described as 'pumpkin on a tooth pick syndrome,' she said. 'Put simply, my ligaments do not support my spine, my spine moves, my head slides and wobbles and my brainstem is stretched and compressed and is causing catastrophic damage to my body. 'Each movement I make causes more and more damage, resulting in more impairment and generating more disabilities. I am constantly bed ridden and I am in so much pain.' The surgery Miss Parsons is due to undergo in the US is major and there are risks attached, but it has a 95 per cent success rate. 'What I have and the pain I suffer is similar to what people suffer when they have injured their body following a major car crash.'","Nina Parsons has Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, which weakens collagen .

"Scientists have created an entire simulation of the universe in order to understand the formation of galaxies, stars and more. The man-made cosmos is a computer simulation in which galaxies similar to those observed by astronomers grow and evolve. Two of the world's most powerful supercomputers - the 'Cosmology Machine' at the University of Durham and 'Curie' in Paris - were used to conduct the simulations, which took several months in total to run. Scroll down for videos . The new simulation could reveal how galaxies and dark matter formed in the early universe. Here, gas in the Eagle Simulation shows hot bubbles (red colours) surrounding large galaxies, connected by colder filaments (blue and green colours). The insets show the distribution of gas, stars and dark matter . Previous attempts to model the formation of galaxies have met with little success, producing collections of stars that were often too massive, small, old or spherical. Those produced in the Eagle (Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments) simulation are much more realistic. One key to its success is the recreation of galactic winds - cosmic gas gales driven by stars, supernova explosions and supermassive black holes - which are stronger than those in earlier simulations, say the scientists. Galactic winds affect the development of galaxies by blowing away the gas from which stars form. The sizes and shapes of the thousands of galaxies produced in the Eagle simulation closely match their 'real' counterparts, and can be used to study the history of the universe almost as far back as the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago. Professor Richard Bower, from the University of Durham, said: 'The universe generated by the computer is just like the real thing. There are galaxies everywhere, with all the shapes, sizes and colours I've seen with the world's largest telescopes. 'It is incredible. In the Eagle universe I can even press a button to make time run backwards.' Results from the research will appear in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society tomorrow. Co-author Dr Rob Crain, from Liverpool John Moores University, said: 'This is the start of a new era for us. We can now manipulate the conditions of the universe and study the evolution of galaxies throughout the past 14 billion years.' Dark matter accounts for around 85 per cent of the universe. It surrounds galaxies across the universe, and is invisible because it does not reflect light. It cannot be seen directly with telescopes, but astronomers know it to be out there because of the gravitational effects it has on the matter we can see. A dark matter halo is the hypothetical region that surrounds a galaxy. It is thought to extend well beyond the visible edge of the galaxy and dominates the total mass of the galaxy. However, since they cannot be observed directly their existence is only a theory. Nonetheless its believed that many galaxies were born in such halos - but why there are only a few in our vicinity is a mystery. According to Durham University's simulation the explanation could be that only those halos that grew fast enough after the Big Bang were able to eventually form galaxies. The Eagle simulation may also help in the hunt for one of the universe's most elusive phenomena - dark matter. Physicists say the simulations show that 'halos' of matter that formed as the universe developed could be evidence of the elusive substance. Scientists believe that these clumps of dark matter, or halos, that emerged from the early universe trapped intergalactic gas and became the birthplaces of galaxies. Cosmological theory predicts that our own cosmic neighbourhood should be teeming with millions of small halos containing galaxies, but only a few dozen such small galaxies have been observed around the Milky Way. 'I've . been losing sleep over this for the last 30 years,' said Professor Carlos Frenk, Director of Durham University's Institute for Computational Cosmology. 'Dark . matter is the key to everything we know about galaxies, but we still . don't know its exact nature. 'Understanding how galaxies formed holds the . key to the dark matter mystery.' One of the biggest mysteries is why there isn't a galaxy in every halo. The researchers believe their simulations answer this question, showing explicitly how and why millions of halos around our galaxy and neighbouring Andromeda failed to produce galaxies and became barren. They say the gas that would have made the galaxy was sterilised by the heat from the first stars that formed in the universe, and was prevented from cooling and turning into stars. However, a few halos managed to bypass this cosmic furnace by growing early and fast enough to hold on to their gas and eventually form galaxies. In this animation, a flight through 13 billion years of cosmic history takes us to 'our' Local Group in the Eagle simulation. The change in colours indicates how stars heat up the intergalactic gas to high temperatures (credit: Richard Bower, Durham University) The simulation is hoped to solve the mystery as to why there isn't a galaxy in every dark matter halo. Here the visible galaxies in the Local Group simulation, shown in the lower right, only trace a tiny fraction of the vast number of dark matter halos, revealed in the upper left . The findings, first presented at the Royal Astronomical Society's National Astronomy Meeting in Portsmouth earlier this year, were funded by the UK's Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) and the European Research Council. A recent Massachusetts-led researchers said they may have found the first hints of dark matter particles. Using two observatories they found an unidentified spike of X-ray intensity in a galaxy cluster 240 million light-years away. The signal could be the sign of the decay of 'sterile neutrinos', one of the proposed particles that dark matter is made of. However, the researchers claim the dark matter explanation is a 'long shot'. 'We have learned that most dark matter halos are quite different from the 'chosen few' that are lit up by starlight,' Professor Frenk continued, referring to some that contain stars and some that do not. 'Thanks to our simulations we know that if our theories of dark matter are correct then the universe around us should be full of halos that failed to make a galaxy. 'Perhaps astronomers will one day figure out a way to find them.' Lead researcher Dr Till Sawala, in the Institute for Computational Cosmology, at Durham University, said the research was the first to simulate the evolution of our 'Local Group' of galaxies. This is a group of more than 54 galaxies that includes Andromeda and the Milky Way. 'What we've seen in our simulations is a cosmic own goal,' said Dr Sawala. 'We already knew that the first generation of stars emitted intense radiation, heating intergalactic gas to temperatures hotter than the surface of the sun. 'After that, the gas is so hot that further star formation gets a lot more difficult, leaving halos with little chance to form galaxies. 'We were able to show that the cosmic heating was not simply a lottery with a few lucky winners. 'Instead, it was a rigorous selection process and only halos that grew fast enough were fit for galaxy formation.' The findings by the researchers were funded by the UK's Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) and the European Research Council. The team used the DiRAC Cosmology Machine, pictured, to create the simulation. It has 6720 Intel Xeon Cores and 53,760 gigabytes of ram . The close-up look at the Local Group is part of the larger Eagle project currently undertaken by cosmologists at Durham University and the University of Leiden in the Netherlands. Eagle is one of the first attempts to simulate what happened from the Big Bang to the present day in the formation of galaxies in the universe. By peering into the virtual universe, the researchers find galaxies that look remarkably like our own, surrounded by countless dark matter halos, only a small fraction of which contain galaxies. The Durham-led simulation was carried out on the 'Cosmology Machine', which is the part of the DiRAC national supercomputing facility for research in astrophysics and particle physics funded by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills through the STFC. The Cosmology Machine - based at Durham University - has more than 5,000 times the computing power of typical PCs, and over 10,000 times the amount of memory.","Researchers at Durham University in the UK and Leiden University in the Netherlands have made an entire simulation of the universe .

"The grandmother who was locked up for hugging her granddaughter said she had been ‘treated worse than a dog’ after she was freed yesterday. Kathleen Danby, 72, had been forced to spend two nights in prison and one in a police cell – before being hauled before a court in handcuffs yesterday flanked by four security guards. She raised her arms in relief after a judge at the secretive Court of Protection quashed her three-month prison term for embracing the vulnerable 19-year-old girl. Scroll down for video . Grandmother Kathleen Danby, 72, celebrated today outside the Civil and Family Justice Hearing Centre in Birmingham after being released from police custody following her arrest for hugging her granddaughter . Grandmother: Kathleen Danby, 72, will finally appear before the  Court of Protection over her embrace with the vulnerable girl. She is pictured here with her grandchildren - their faces are obscured for legal reasons . In an interview with the Mail, the 4ft 11in grandmother told how she had been left terrified and suffered bruises and cuts when she was manhandled by police officers. She revealed that she had been deprived of sleep and food, refused access to a lawyer and barred from calling her son during her three days in custody. Astonishingly, police officers and prison guards even refused to allow her to take the daily medicine she needs to combat her liver disease. ‘By the end of my ordeal I felt shattered and very weak,’ she said, adding: ‘I was treated worse than a dog. My first cell wasn’t fit for a dog – let alone a 72-year-old grandmother. ‘And when I told a guard that I was in jail for hugging my granddaughter his jaw dropped in open-mouthed amazement. He was astonished and horrified. ‘I deserve an apology and compensation for the way I have been treated.’ Mrs Danby was originally sentenced in her absence to three months in jail by the Court of Protection in April for hugging her granddaughter. Mrs Danby, pictured with her grand children, was held in custody for three nights following her arrest . Mrs Danby, 72, (pictured outside Birmingham Crown Court today) was arrested on Sunday night for breaching an order as she sat down to watch comic Ken Dodd perform at the Liverpool Philharmonic Hall . Speaking outside court today, the frail grandmother said she had been through 'a humiliating ordeal' Physical contact between the pair had been banned by a draconian ruling by Derbyshire County Council’s social services. It launched the legal proceedings when it received photographic evidence of the hug. In an extraordinary move, she was arrested on Sunday night within minutes of sitting in her seat at Liverpool Philharmonic Hall to watch the comedian Ken Dodd. Describing her arrest, she said: ‘I was just sitting down to enjoy the show when a doorman told me that there was someone there to see me. ‘I went outside and there were two police officers waiting for me. I went quietly to avoid embarrassment.’ She was taken to St Anne Street police station where she claims she was mocked by the duty officers and refused food and medicine all night. ‘They put me in a cell without giving me an evening meal,’ Mrs Danby said. ‘They took away my belt, shoes and coat. It was really rough in there. The pillow was really hard and had no cover. The mattress felt like it was broken. The blanket was worn and used. ‘I didn’t get to sleep until 6.30am and was woken up at 8.30am and told I was being driven to Birmingham. At this stage I felt I was wilting.’ Mrs Danby refused to leave the cell until she was given her medicine. Ignoring her request, officers then grabbed her by the wrists and bundled her into a prison van, an ordeal which she said left her with cuts and bruises. She added: ‘I was very annoyed and upset that they could treat somebody at my age in that manner – especially as they did not know anything about me or what I had been arrested for. ‘I told them I needed my pills for my liver disease. I’m not suddenly going to keel over if I don’t have them but it’s not good for me to go without. But they just said they were going to forcibly remove me.’ Judge Sally Dowding reduced Mrs Danby's (pictured) sentence to time already served and said: 'I am satisfied she fully appreciates the difficulties of her position and what she must do, and I am confident she will comply' Mrs Danby was driven from Liverpool to Birmingham Magistrates’ Court where an official told G4S guards that she had been taken to the wrong place. She was then put back in the van and taken to Foston Hall women’s prison in Derbyshire, whose former inmates include Ian Huntley’s girlfriend Maxine Carr and Karen Matthews, who kidnapped her own daughter Shannon. The grandmother then spent a further two days locked up before she was able to appear before a circuit judge yesterday. As the old year turns to the new, Kathleen Danby’s ordeal is a chilling reminder of what a secretive society Britain remains – and the unrestrained powers the authorities can exercise when the public is denied its right to know. Refused access to the Court of Protection, this paper has no idea whether or not there were good reasons for banning Mrs Danby from contacting her granddaughter. What we do know for sure is that there can never be any justification for a judge sentencing a 72-year-old to prison in her absence, without giving the public a full explanation of why. Let 2015, the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta, be the year this Kafkaesque court is thrown open to the light of accountability. ‘By the time I arrived I hadn’t eaten or slept properly for 24 hours,’ she said. ‘I hadn’t received any medication. I had been bullied and driven from pillar to post. I wouldn’t wish my ordeal on anyone. My time in Foston Hall women’s prison was my first time in jail. ‘When I told other inmates about what I was in for their mouths dropped in amazement.’ She said she was told several times she would be able to call her son, but that these proved to be ‘empty promises’. Yesterday morning a guard opened her cell at 6am and told her that she would be appearing in court later that day. The guard allegedly told her the prison knew about the court hearing, but failed to tell her the previous day. Mrs Danby, from Orkney, met a lawyer for the first time yesterday morning at court – moments before the case was due to start. Her lawyer was given a three-inch file of notes relating to the case. Meanwhile, Mrs Danby continued to be treated like a common criminal. She was guarded by four G4S prison guards and even handcuffed to a woman officer when she needed to use the toilet. She was finally freed by a judge when she apologised for breaching an order banning her from hugging her granddaughter. Her Honour Judge Dowding said: ‘I am not here today to change the decision of the previous court. I am here to allow her the chance to purge her contempt. I am satisfied she understands the orders now.’ Legal case: Judge Sally Dowding reduced the sentence of Mrs Danby (pictured) to time already served .","Kathleen Danby, 72, was jailed for hugging her vulnerable granddaughter .

"Tony Blair last night gave Ed Miliband his full backing – just hours after saying he expects the Labour leader to lose the election in May. The former prime minister sparked a backlash after an interview in which he warned the party had been dragged to the Left and is on course for disaster at the polls. But he was forced to issue a denial within hours, saying his comments had been ‘misinterpreted’. Tony Blair, pictured right, gave his full backing to Ed Miliband, pictured left, hours after saying he expects the Labour leader to lose the election in May . He added on Twitter: ‘I fully support Ed and my party and expect a Labour victory in the election.’ Charlie Whelan, a former spin doctor for Gordon Brown, responded: ‘Don’t be surprised if no one believes you.’ Mr Blair had angered Labour high command after telling The Economist that the election was shaping up to be one ‘in which a traditional Left-wing party competes with a traditional Right-wing party, with the traditional result’. Asked if he meant a Tory win, Mr Blair replied: ‘Yes, that is what happens.’ But his intervention was a blow to the Labour leader, who is struggling to convince his own party that he can win the election. In a further setback yesterday, a prominent Left-winger said the party’s ruling elite looked down on working class supporters in the North. Wansbeck MP Ian Lavery, a former miner, said: ‘We’ve got an elite in Westminster which quite frankly frightens me. The former prime minister sparked a backlash after an interview in which he warned the party had been dragged to the Left and is on course for disaster at the polls . ‘They haven’t been anywhere or done anything, and when you’ve got an accent like mine they think, “well that man doesn’t really know too much”.’ A Blairite former minister yesterday said it was right to raise concerns about the direction Mr Miliband is taking the party. David Lammy said Mr Blair’s comments should be taken ‘very seriously indeed’, adding: ‘Labour has to be the party of small business, we have to be the party of enterprise and we do have to be clear that we understand that it is actually industry that is the engine of our economy and not give the impression that we are solely focused on the public sector.’ Lucy Powell, Mr Miliband’s election chief, yesterday dismissed the warning that Labour’s lurch to the Left had left it vulnerable to defeat. Referring to Mr Blair, she said: ‘He has his experience from his era. That is not the era we now live in.’ In the interview, Mr Blair also argued that Britain has shifted to the Right in the wake of the economic crash and said Labour succeeds best when it is in the ‘centre ground’. Paul Kenny, general secretary of the GMB union, described his views as ‘sad and disappointing’. He added: ‘Tony Blair is now a very wealthy person sitting on top of the pile and is disconnected from the lives of ordinary people. ‘Having lost touch with ordinary people it is hardly surprising that he labels promising a decent living wage, homes for rent, decent rights at work and making the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes to be vote-losing policies.’ Veteran Labour MP David Winnick said Mr Blair should remember the Clement Attlee quip ‘a period of silence on your part would be welcome’. A Labour victory in this year’s general election would spark economic ‘chaos’, David Cameron warns today. The Prime Minister will use his New Year message to say Labour’s addiction to borrowing poses ‘huge risks’ to an economy that is now on the mend – as experts predict wages are finally set to outstrip inflation this year. The Institute of Directors expects pay to rise by an average of 2 to 3 per cent in the next 12 months as company balance sheets improve. Meanwhile, the Centre for Economics and Business Research will today forecast that average prices could start to fall for the first time since 1960 because of the impact of cheaper oil. In his message, Mr Cameron will say Britain’s progress is at grave risk if Ed Miliband seizes power in May – either outright or as part of a coalition government. In a plea for a second term, he will claim the UK is being ‘turned around’ by the Tories, adding: ‘Britain has a choice between the competence that has got us this far or the chaos of giving it up, going backwards and taking huge risks.’","Former Prime Minister Tony Blair gave Ed Miliband his full backing .

"The BBC's decision to shelve a documentary about the Royal Family days before it was due to be broadcast is 'sinister censorship', critics said today. Reinventing The Royals is said to be critical of Prince Charles' attempt to rebuild his reputation and increase public sympathy for Camilla Parker Bowles after the death of Princess Diana. MPs said today the Royals are guilty of 'gross interference' after  lawyers known to represent Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall are said to have complained about the shows. Critics have also said that the BBC has questions to answer after failing to 'stand firm' under pressure over the documentary. Controversial:  Reinventing The Royals is said to be critical of Prince Charles' attempt to rebuild his reputation after the death of Diana, left in 1990, and his relationship with Camilla Parker-Bowles, together in 1997 . The series was due to have documented a PR plan to make Charles and Camilla more popular after Diana's death in 1997 in a campaign called 'Operation Mrs PB'. Informed sources close to the Royal Family said its makers said it would be a 'general look' at the relationship between the media and the monarchy but 'appears to have become a hatchet job'. Welsh Labour MP Paul Flynn told MailOnline: 'It seems to be gross interference with the BBC in their role to tell their paymasters, the British public, the truth. 'The Royals have used their expensive PR operation to influence the BBC. 'People are right to believe this is sinister censorship. This is not Moscow - the BBC should be fearless and free to broadcast. 'But the BBC should have held firm. We are being infantilised by broadcasters who are keeping the truth from us about the Royals. 'All this will do is increase pressure to have it shown and increase the number of people who will watch it when it is'. Jim Sheridan, a senior MP on the Commons culture, media and sport committee, told the Daily Mirror: 'We cannot now have the Royal Family deciding what can and cannot be shown on our national broadcaster. That is a dangerous precedent to set. 'The BBC is a publicly-funded broadcaster and if this programme is in the public interest then it must be shown.' New life: The documentary is said shed light on Prince Charles's attempts to repair his battered image using the Royal Family's PR department to make him look caring . According to the Radio Times, the documentary, presented by former Panorama editor Steve Hewlett, was pulled from the 9pm slot on Sunday's schedule after lawyers 'known to represent senior members of the royal family' had made contact. Mr Hewlett edited Panorama during its notorious interview with Diana in 1995 in which she referred to Charles's affair with Mrs Parker Bowles, saying: 'There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded.' The new programmes are said to say Charles's methods to improve his image left the teenage Prince William feeling he had been 'used to further his father's interests' after details of his first meeting with Mrs Parker Bowles ten months after Diana's death were leaked to a journalist. Upset: Labour MP Paul Flynn says the Royal Family are guilty of 'gross interference' and the BBC should not have caved in . Mr Hewlett says in an article for the Radio Times that Charles hired Mark Bolland from the Press Complaints Commission to act as his media advisor in what was a departure for the royal family. He says Mr Bolland tried to repair the Prince's battered image by taking every opportunity to show his different side as a single parent and caring father. His other objective was to increase public acceptance for the woman Charles described as a 'non-negotiable' part of his life – Mrs Parker Bowles, who is now Duchess of Cornwall. A BBC spokesman said: 'The BBC is delaying broadcast of the documentary Reinventing The Royals, due to be shown on BBC Two on January 4, until later in the New Year while a number of issues including the use of archive footage are resolved.' A source in the corporation said the delay is temporary and it is 'certain to air soon'. Graham Smith from Republic, who want the monarchy abolished, said: 'The BBC has a responsibility to the public to show no fear or favour in its reporting. Prince Charles is in line to be Britain's head of state - he must be subjected to the same standards of media scrutiny as any politician. 'The BBC and other broadcasters are far too deferential to the royals. It's time they began to treat them in the same way they treat politicians and other public officials.' It is understood the Royal Family had co-operated with the documentary but then became worried about its content. Informed sources say Clarence House appears to feel the programme makers have been disingenuous from the start about what they intended to do with the documentary. 'What started out as a general look at the relationship between the media and the monarchy appears to have become a hatchet job on the Prince of Wales', one source said.","Documentary called Reinventing the Royals pulled days before broadcast .

"More than 60 people were arrested and 83 others were hurt when a New Year's Eve festival in New Zealand erupted into a riot. Police had a running battle with drunks for three hours, during which full bottles, cans and camping gear were used as projectiles at the Gisborne New Year's Eve festival. The brawl broke out in the festival camp grounds late in the afternoon at the beach-side festival, during which cars were flipped over and fires lit. Scroll down for video . The NYE festival at Gisborne in New Zealand turned into a full-scale riot as brawlers tipped cars, threw bottles and lit fires . The aftermath of the Gisborne brawl. Festival staff survey the camp grounds after police were locked in a three hour battle with troublemakers . Mikayla Stuart, was working at a food stall inside the festival grounds and told Stuff.co.nz 'I'm not too sure whether it was pre-planned or not but a lot of campers got on board with it very quickly. 'There were cans of alcohol flying through the air as well as chairs tent poles hitting heaps of people ... another worker and I were curious and went to have a closer look and it turned into absolute chaos.' Images from the camp ground show worried party-goers cowering behind mattresses as projectiles rained down across the camp sites. This is not the first time there has been a problem with the crowds and the local police commander, Inspector Sam Aberahama, also told the website that the riot was a planned event and co-ordinated ahead of time by trouble-makers. Smoke billows from a camp site at the height of the Gisborne riot. Unlimited alcohol was allowed in the festival grounds, police say 83 people were injured and 63 arrested . NZ authorities are now investigating the rules around the event, which attracted more than 7000 people and allowed unlimited alcohol into the camps. It was a decision local police had unsuccessfully challenged ahead of the day. 'This was an intentional riot that was fuelled by alcohol. It was obvious a plan had been put in place by the main agitators, which quickly spread through the campgrounds. We used every available police resource to try to keep control of the crowds, he told Stuff.co.nz. 83 people required treatment from ambulance officers for a range of injuries, seven were taken to hospital. The problem started when people inside nearby camp grounds began trading insults at a fence line, pushing it over to begin the brawl. The fight quickly spread. In the end, 63 trouble-makers were arrested at the scene and face charges ranging from disorderly behaviour to assault.","New Year's festival turns into a three-hour riot in New Zealand .

"Haunting family photographs and treasured possessions belonging to Jewish victims of the Holocaust have been discovered in an attic more than 70 years after they were sent to concentration camps. Jewellery boxes and pictures believed to belong Samuel Gottschall and his loved ones, who were murdered by Nazis during the Second World War, were hidden away in a dim and damp attic in Slovakia. The stash was discovered between the roof beams of a home in the city of Presov in Slovakia by  handyman, Imrich Girasek, who was fixing his neighbour's leaking roof. Scroll down for video . Haunting: This photograph found in the stash of personal belongings is believed to show Samuel Gottschall (right) and his family. They were all sent to concentration camps . Hidden treasures: Cutlery, photographs and documents were found in the house in Presov, Slovakia . Poignant: These family photos were taken before the deportation of the city's Jews began . Letters, newspaper clippings, a Jewish songbook, jewellery and cutlery had also been stowed away in 1942 - the year the deportation of the city's Jews started. Many families had left behind such personal collections in the hope that they would return to collect them. But they never did. Handyman: Imrich Girasek was fixing a neighbour's leaking roof when he came across the haul . Girasek, a 46-year-old former soldier and married father-of-five, said: 'The old roof needed to be checked so I went there because the owners are my friends. 'They have owned the house since the 1960s. 'The owners of the house weren't interested in the things, but I couldn't bring myself to simply throw them away.' The items were found next to suitcases from the period, but the handyman thinks they had been looted. 'I believe the things were initially stored in the suitcases and then hidden in the attic, but that somebody searching for valuables must have taken them out and left them lying about,' Mr Girasek added. 'The jewellery boxes were all empty. Somebody must have stolen the jewellery years ago.' He carefully leafed through  the documents and photographs – among them wedding pictures and family portraits – but was not able to identify the people in the pictures. 'Most likely all of them were deported to a transportation camp,' he added. 'All the found documents date back to before 1942, and the first transport of Jews from Presov happened in 1942.' Mr Girasek gave the items to the city's Museum of Jewish Culture with the hope the family could be identified and  relatives located. 'It would make me happy to know that the things had been passed on to people close to the family who used to own them,' he added. Mystery: The photographs found in the Presov home are believed to belong to Mr Gottschall's family, but the museum researching their origins cannot be 100 per cent certain . Discovered: This document, believed to feature college graduates, includes a photograph of a man with the surname Gottschall . Family portrait: These smartly dressed subjects are thought to be connected to the Gottschall family . Gita Eckhausová, head of Presov's Jewish Religious Community, said: 'We have gone through the material and compared the photographs with historic photos from our archives. 'It would appear that the items belonged to the family of Jewish Neolog cantor (prayer leader) Samuel Gottschall. 'According to our research, the people pictured in the photographs are Gottschall and his family, but we can't be 100 percent certain.' Mr Gottschall, born in 1878, was deported to a concentration camp in 1942 along with his entire family. Lubica Tatranska, the museum's employee responsible for the restoration of historic items, said: 'Everything is dirty and dusty. The Jews used to hide their personal and valuable things before they were deported. 'Most of them thought they were going to labour camps and would eventually return.' Artifacts: The items are now at the Museum of Jewish Culture, once an Orthodox synagogue . Unassuming: The stash was found in the attic of this house, built next to the Neolog synagogue . Holy place: The items were found in a house next to the Neolog synagogue (pictured), which is now a shop . Unidentified: Staff at the museum believe the photographs belong to Samuel Gottschall, but individuals cannot named . Lubica Tatranska, the museum's employee responsible for the restoration of historic items, said some of the documents and photos are damaged and have no value . Slovakia had been an ally of Nazi Germany and the country supplied it with workers. However, when it fell short of the promised numbers, it agreed to replace the shortfall with 10,000 to 20,000 deported Slovak Jews. Before the war, some 136,000 Jews lived in Slovakia, but now there are only about 4,000. In Presov, the third-largest city in Slovakia, some 6,000 Jews were deported to concentration camps between 1942 and 1945. Only 800 people returned to the city after the war and many of them later emigrated, often to the US, Australia, Israel and the UK. The documents found in the attic are written in German, Hungarian, Yiddish and Hebrew, and several bear the surname Gottschall, including newspaper clippings and a songbook and musical scores signed by Samuel Gottschall. The items were located in the house built next to the Neolog synagogue in Presov's historic city centre. Further research in the Australian Dictionary of Biography has indicated that Mr Gottschall may have had son who survived the horrors of the war - Benjamin Bela Vojtech - who became a rabbi. He married Margareta Glässner in 1938 in the Czech town of Louny. Discovery: This was another of the documents found between the roof beams . Musical: Museum employee Lubica Tatranska carefully inspects this Jewish songbook, which was stowed away in 1942 . The country was an ally of Nazi Germany. Slovakia paid 500 Reichsmark to Germany for accepting each deported Jew, under the condition that none would ever return. Before the deportation had even started, Heinrich Himmler, one of the most powerful men in Nazi Germany, proposed that Slovakia be made entirely free of Jews. The Slovak government readily agreed to this. Historical sources estimate that as many as 70,000 Slovak Jews were deported to concentration camps during the war. In Presov, the third-largest city in Slovakia, some 6,000 Jews were deported between 1942 and 1945. During the Second World War, Mr Vojtech secretly carried out religious services before he and his wife were transported to Auschwitz in German-occupied Poland. Mr Vojtech's wife died in Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, but he survived and was liberated in May 1945. After the war, he served as a communal rabbi to the surviving Jews in Prague. He remarried in 1946 and left Czechoslovakia for Australia three years later with his, then pregnant, wife and one child, to escape the hardship under the communist regime. Mr Vojtech died of cancer in 1978 in Sydney, but this is where the trail ends. The items will be cleaned, counted and become part of the museum's collection in the coming weeks. Any relatives who get in touch with the museum can claim the items discovered by Mr Girasek. Manuscript: This document helped the museum staff identify its owner. It was signed by Samuel Gottschall .

"New year's parties are today being replaced by new year's resolutions, as Australians wake up with collective sore heads and tales to tell of a big night spent ushering in 2015. The major capital cities quickly turned from party central to project clean-up. In Sydney, council officials estimated the almost 350 workers have collected almost 50 tonnes of rubbish from across the harbour city, their New Year's Day spent tidying from the beaches into the CBD, at a cost of up to $400,000. The morning after, Lord Mayor Clover Moore said: 'For me it was a little bit like when the Olympic Games was on.' And she paid particular tribute to cleaning staff. '(They) started work straight after the fireworks, and as you can see the city is sparkling this morning,' she said. Scroll down for video .

In Melbourne, hundreds of cleaning staff were deployed soon after the midnight fireworks, restoring the banks of the Yarra River to pristine condition. Some Victorian revellers were still struggling to find a way home as light dawned on the new year, some choosing to sit it out in Federation Square before finding their way home.

"Families in booming towns in the South East have seen their homes soar in value by up to £2,000 every month since David Cameron became Prime Minister, new research reveals. Home owners in Surrey, Hertfordshire and outer London have enjoyed a four year property boom far outstripping the rest of the country. But over the same time, deprived towns in West Yorkshire, Country Durham and Northumberland have seen house prices fall by thousands of pounds – trapping families in negative equity. Scroll down for video . Figures for the last four years show the average monthly house price change, including seven towns when properties have fallen in value . By comparison, some properties in the Home Counties have risen by almost £2,000-a-month since David Cameron came to power . The stark north-south house price divide is exposed in new research for MailOnline by the property website Zoopla. It shows that outside prime central London – the Britain’s biggest boom towns are Harpenden and Radlet in Hertfordshire, Esher in Surrey and Stanmore in north west London. Homes in Harpenden were worth £576,554 in May 2010, but have risen in value to £732,059 – a 26.97 per cent increase. Nearby Radlett has seen average prices jump from £668,148 to £842,679, while properties in Esher have increased by £198,167 to £952,421. Homes in Stanmore meanwhile have jumped 34.16 per cent to an average of £610,074 – an increase of £155,326 from May 2010. The biggest average monthly rises were in Esher in Surrey and Richmond in south west London . The largest monthly falls were in Shildon in County Durham and Castleford West Yorkshire . However, families in towns away from the south east have seen the values of their homes stagnate – or even fall – under the Coalition. Properties in Shildon, County Durham, were worth an average of £81,367 in 2010. But by November they had fallen back to just £77,540 – a fall on £3,827, or 4.7 per cent. Close-by Ferryhill, in Tony Blair’s former constituency of Sedgefield, has seen properties fall by 3 per cent on average – down from £92,459 to just £89,678. Further north in Prudhoe, Northumberland, houses have fallen £2,573 – from £180,377 to £177,804. Castleford and Heckmondwike in West Yorkshire have also struggled over the past four years, while southern towns boom. In Castleford homes have fallen £4,419 to £124,082 while in Heckmondwike the average property is now worth just £115,439 – down from £118,475 in May 2010. Sedgefield MP Phil Wilson said the figures revealed that large areas of the country were being left behind. 'This just goes to prove that there is a major north-south divide in the country and the recovery has clearly not been for everyone. ‘Hard-working families in places like Ferryhill in my constituency are not seeing the benefits of the economic recovery. The growth we’re seeing is benefiting the few and not the many.’ It comes after George Osborne outlined plans in the Autumn Statement last week to overhaul Britain’s stamp duty rules – which critics claimed could spark a fresh house-price boom in the south. Mr Osborne radically rejigged the stamp duty bands to get rid of the cliff-edge bands putting people off buying homes close to £250,000. Previously buyers paid the percentage above thresholds on the entire purchase price – creating a situation where tax bills rocketed from £2,500 to at least £7,500 when buying a home costing more than £250,000. Mr Osborne claimed 98 per cent of homebuyers will pay less tax thanks to the changes. Only those buying homes costing more than £937,000 will face a bigger tax bill, he said. Bands are now 0 per cent up to £125,000; 2 per cent to £250,000; 5 per cent to £925,000; 10 per cent to £1.5million and 12 per cent above that. Previously they stood at 1 per cent above £125,000; 3 per cent above £250,000, 4 per cent above £500,000; 5 per cent above £1million and 7 per cent above £2million. The change spells bad news for those buying the most expensive properties, however. Someone purchasing a £1million home would see a rise in their tax bill from £40,000 to £43,750, but the buyer of a £1.5million home will see their bill rise from £75,000 to £93,750. Someone buying a £2million home, right at the limit of where the old 7 per cent rate kicked in, will see their stamp duty bill rocket from £100,000 to £153,750. Devon is the most popular place in Britain to build a new home, a survey has revealed. Around 7million people in the UK dream of transforming a plot of land into their own customised dream home. In 2014 Devon became the most searched-for county for people looking for the perfect spot to build their own properties, closely followed by the Scottish Highlands and then Kent. Devon is the most popular place to build your own home in the UK, followed by the Scottish Highlands . Southern regions of the UK feature heavily in the list - with Cambridgeshire, Somerset and Avon, Hampshire, Cornwall and Sussex all in the top 10 places budding house builders search for to build their own homes. Aberdeenshire in Scotland and Carmarthenshire in west Wales also appear in the top 10 places as many people search for rural spots to build their dream homes. The relatively unspoiled countryside of Devon may appeal to some home builders, with 18,500 online plot searches done for the county in the last 12 months. Searches also typically peak around January as people look to move home and make a fresh start in the new year. Prices for plots in the UK vary widely across the country, but can start from as little as £6,950. However in Virginia Water in Surrey a 1.5 acre plot can cost £5.2million. Building your own home appeals to many people because it gives them the chance to tailor every inch of their house to their needs.

"Mark Taylor, pictured, accidentally tweeted his location when updating his followers on the micro-blogging social media website . A New Zealand jihadi fighting for ISIS has been accidentally tweeting his location from within Syria as he updates his followers on his time in the warzone. Mark Taylor, who is known on Twitter as @M_Taylor_Kiwi had forgotten to switch off the geo-location on his tweets as he travelled across Syria. Taylor, who changed his name to Abu Abdul-Rahman, made a series of 45 tweets which broadcast his ever-changing location. The series of tweets was saved by the Canadian based social media jihad monitor Ibrabo. Taylor soon deleted his tweets, which gave vital intelligence information to various government agencies. According to a blog post, Ibrabo claimed: 'Taylor isn’t the first jihadist to broadcast his whereabouts via social media and in fact looking at the battlefield in Syria we see fighters from Canada, France, and other western countries making the same mistake. The benefit of material like this when examining foreign fighters is it allows investigators to establish the extent to which an individual is tied to a terrorist group like Daesh (ISIS). In this manner they can better justify potential criminal charges against the individual and at the very least build grounds for their detention and investigation upon their return.' According to Ibrabo, Taylor used one house in Al Tabaqah in the south west part of the city. 'Taylor eager for the fame of being a violent jihadist took to twitter to get attention for his exploits. His statements and twitter missteps have solidified his involvement with ISIS and will provide the evidence should he ever try to return to New Zealand. His ignorance and the ignorance of others has been an advantage to intelligence agencies around the world looking to protect their nations and track the progress of ISIS. Ibrabo were able to track several of Mark Taylor's tweets to an individual house in Al Tabaqah . Ibrabo claimed that Taylor's error has provided vital information to western intelligence agencies . Ibrabo found a series of 45 tweets which provided very detailed information about Taylor's location . The series of tweets could have identified a number of ISIS safe houses across several Syrian cities . Ibrabo added: 'Taylor’s numerous failures demonstrate the opportunities that can be gained through monitoring and tracking extremists via social media and telecommunications. Given his need for attention I’m sure this will not be the last we hear from Kiwi Jihadi. With luck he will fail to read the manual on his next shiny new phone!' Taylor came to public prominence when he burned his New Zealand passport and recorded the incident on YouTube. He later denied that he had been seeking new travel documents claiming that reports of his wish to return to New Zealand were false. In July this year he told the New Zealand Herald on Sunday that he would remain in Syria until he achieved 'martyrdom'. He said he became a jihad because he was 'refused by the NZ Army for re-enlistment'. In a 15 second video posted on YouTube in June, a man who is named as Taylor says: 'I am the New Zealander known as Mark John Taylor, my current location is in Syria and my commitment is for jihad, for Allah and his messenger.' In September 2011, he appeared on TV3's 60 Minutes and claimed his life had been ruined after he previously travelled to Pakistan in 2009 and tried to enter the al-Qaeda stronghold of Wana. He said he had only travelled to the Middle Eastern country to 'find a wife'. He was exposed when he was named amongst a list of 23 Australian-based people of security interest in a secret diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks. 'I didn't have a death wish I was just looking for a lady for marriage. It was my mistake. People might call me stupid and dumb for making that mistake but that's my problem,' he told 60 Minutes. New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said in 2011 that Taylor was 'someone that has quite a number of restrictions on him for very good reasons'. But Taylor was released without charge in Pakistan and moved to Australia, back to New Zealand, and then Indonesia where he worked as English teacher before travelling to Syria via Turkey in July this year - despite his travel restrictions. In June he reportedly told The Australian that he hasn't joined any groups 'except for al-Qaeda'. The paper reports that on Sunday, he commented on Facebook that New Zealand authorities 'don’t seem concern (sic) I’m in Syria'. Despite his apparent desire to have a New Zealand passport again, Taylor reportedly told the Aotearoa Independent Media Centre that he doesn't actually want to return to New Zealand.","Mark Taylor, known as Abu Abdul-Rahman deleted 45 tweets from Syria .

The giant blue light bulb is revealed with red electricity sparking into the sky . The City of Sydney also used the moment to pay tribute to the Sydney siege victims, Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson. The words 'We will remember' appeared on the Harbour Bridge pylons three times during the light display, represented as a 'floral' tribute. It symbolised the many thousands of bouquets which were left at Martin Place by mourners, after the pair was tragically killed whilst being held hostage at the Lindt Cafe in Sydney's Martin Place. 'It is in memory of the two young and talented people that we lost because of that siege,' said Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore. 'We remember the trauma the hostages experienced, the bravery of the police and we remember the way Sydney responded as we expected - an inclusive, welcoming, multicultural community,' she said.

Two bright blue seahorses were the stars of the first act of the city's renowned fireworks display. The 9pm display was followed by the Harbour of Light Parade, with more than 50 illuminated boats carrying more than 8,000 people on a majestic passage around the harbour. Never an event to disappoint – both displays featured a total of seven tonnes of fireworks; including 11,000 shells, 25,000 shooting comets and more than 100,000 individual pyrotechnic effects. In what is believed to be a first, drones were be used to live stream the fireworks as they launched from the Harbour Bridge, the Opera House and several barges in the water. They captured incredibly unique images, taking revellers closer to the action than ever before. Showers of sparks and flashes of light could be seen exploding across TV screens as the drones flew a little too close to the display. And as if that wasn't enough - a third mini-display, known as the 'Inspire moment', kicked off at 10.40 to keep crowds entertained in the lead-up to the much-anticipated countdown. Revellers gathered on the foreshore wherever they could find room to catch a glimpse of the magical display . Thousands of people had started the festivities, streaming into Sydney's CBD in anticipation of the evening's spectacular fireworks display, with over 1.6 million Sydneysiders filling the Harbour, and half a million in Melbourne's Federation Square. The Melbourne fireworks blanketed six square kilometres of the city, firing from 21 skyscrapers to delight the senses of up to 600,000 people. However the numbers in Brisbane were disappointing in comparison, with a mere 50,000 people assembling at Southbank to see in the New Year. It was a marked decrease on last year's crowd of 80,000 people. It is believed the muggy conditions were to blame for keeping residents at home. More than $90 thousand worth of fireworks were used in Brisbane's celebrations. In the nation's capital, more than 35,000 made their way into the heart of the city to usher in the new year, enjoying the sounds of Eskimo Joe and Joel Fletcher. There too revellers were treated to a double dose of fireworks at 9pm and then again at midnight. Other icons were also part of the display, with the Sydney Opera House illuminated in an explosion of pink . A symphony of reds, greens, pinks, blues and whites burst over the harbour, which ascended into a waterfall of red and yellow, hurtling from the bottom of the Harbour Bridge . Millions of revellers across Australia just experienced a taste of what is to come at midnight as the iconic Sydney Harbour lit up the night sky in preparation to celebrate the countdown into 2015 . Two bright blue seahorses forming a love heart were the stars of the first act of the city's renowned fireworks display as the Sydney Harbour Bridge once again stole the show . Following the 9pm display, the Harbour of Light Parade saw more than 50 illuminated boats carry over 8,000 people on a majestic passage around Sydney Harbour . Australia's dear country cousin New Zealand was the first to celebrate the new year with a dazzling light display at the top of the Sky Tower in Auckland as the revellers saw in the new year two hours earlier than their Down Under pals. A party atmosphere had built before the show in Sydney's Botanic Gardens where some had been queuing since dawn to get in. Those who had bagged the best spots to watch the fireworks relaxed on blankets in the last of the day's sunshine, many wearing 2015 headdresses and clinking drinks. As the dark descended, loud cheers rang out among the throng in anticipation of the start of the night's celebrations. Calli Newman, from Ohio in the United States, had travelled from Brisbane saying: 'I've wanted to do this for ages.' Her friend, Chris Porter, added: 'When you Google the best places for New Year, Sydney always comes out top. 'I started queuing at about 7am but there were a lot of people here since 5am. It's been fun.' Below the gardens hundreds of boats of all sizes bobbed around in the harbour, with those lucky enough to be on board sure to have some of the best vantage points of all to watch the fireworks. Both fireworks displays feature a total of seven tonnes of fireworks, including 11,000 shells, 25,000 shooting comets and more than 100,000 individual pyrotechnic effects . The Sydney Opera House appears striking with fire works going off in the background . Even the clouds take on fabulous hues from the colourful fire works . By just before 7pm, Sydney proved its popularity, with viewing spots around the Harbour, including Mrs Macquaries Point, East Circular Quay and Blues Point Reserve in North Sydney at capacity. Most streets in Sydney's CBD were also shut down for the New Year's Eve celebration, while areas surrounding the harbour, including McMahons Point, Mosman and Potts Point were blocked. The light display resemble giant lollipops much to the delight of the children looking on in the 9pm family show . Australia's dear country cousin - New Zealand is already celebrating 2015 with a dazzling light display in Auckland . The Sky Tower took on a life of its own in Auckland with colour shooting and sparking from the top of the building . NSW Police began breathalising people on boats in Sydney Harbour, as the vehicles jostle for the best position to view the fireworks. Jack Thompson, creative ambassador for Sydney's New Years Eve celebrations, said the theme for this year's New Years Eve was 'Inspire' and was perfectly suited. 'This city itself is a muse,' Mr Thompson said. 'The muse is what inspires the artist, and this city has been a muse since it was established,' he said.","Both 9pm and midnight fireworks displays featured seven tonnes of fireworks, including 11,000 shells, 25,000 shooting comets and more than 100,000 individual pyrotechnic effects .

"Bernadette Najor (photographed) was reinstated . The Michigan police officer who was fired for forcibly cutting off the artificial hair from a detained woman's head is being reinstated, but the city doesn't want her back. After being terminated more than a year ago, an arbitrator has ruled that Bernadette Najor be reinstated to the Detroit police force with full back pay, benefits, and seniority, Macomb Daily reports. Last year, Najor was fired after being caught on video having Chadra Gregory, then 22, strapped into a chair and brutally yanking and cutting off the woman's hair leaving her with bald spots. A surveillance video of the detention area showed Gregory struggling to stand and Najor repeatedly pushing her, with force, onto a bench. Officers then forced Gregory into a chair, strapped her down, and Najor began forcibly cutting the woman's hair weave from her head. A hair weave is woven into a person's hair using a needle and thread. Rough handling of the artificial hair can result in the  loss of hair and can even cause bruising or great damage to the scalp. Najor spent three minutes yanking and cutting the hair from Gregory's scalp leaving her with bald spots as a result of the hair-pulling attack. Najor held that she cut Gregory's hair because the woman was a suicide risk, but Najor failed to file the paperwork required, stating that she did so, according to the Huffington Post. Scroll down for video . Bald Spots: Najor brutally cut off the hair weave of Charda Gregory leaving her with bald spots and bruises to her scalp (photographed is a photograph of Gregory before the hair-pulling attack, left, and after, right) Though the video has no sound, Gregory is seen kicking her legs and writhing in pain as the officer roughly handles her hair. The Warren Police Department issued a statement indicating that it will follow the arbitrator's decision despite personal opinion. 'The city strongly disagrees with the arbitrator's decision,' the statement reads. 'The actions taken by the Warren Police Department were appropriate and required.' Suicide Risk: Najor held that she cut Gregory's hair because the woman was a suicide risk, but Najor failed to file the paperwork required, stating that she did so . The arbitrator reinstated Najor with the belief that the department did not have just cause to fire the 10-year police force veteran because she violated no terms or conditions of her contract, attorney Peter Sudnick told Macomb Daily. 'It was a pretty clean case. She was completely exonerated,' Sudnick said. Last year, on Nov. 13, Gregory,was arrested for allegedly vandalizing a hotel room, and was taken into custody. Because of the incident, the city of Warren awarded Gregory and her attorney a total of $75,000 and dropped all charges against her, according to ABC. Video: Najor spent three minutes yanking and cutting the hair from Gregory's scalp . Pain: Though the video has no sound, Gregory is seen kicking her legs and writhing in pain as the officer roughly handles her hair . Confronted: Here, Najor threatened to 'call the police' when chased down by a WXYZ reporter in a local parking lot . Immediately after the incident, Jere Green, police commissioner, placed Najor on leave and she was fired nearly a month later. Arbitrator Nora Lynch said that there was insufficient credible evidence to support the department's decision to fire Najor and police administrators said police overreacted about the video and punished Najor only to avoid public criticism, the Post reports. 'To view the video without the benefit of an audio component and without carefully weighing the accounts of officers who were present does not reflect the reality of what occurred,' Lynch said.","Bernadette Najor, the cop who forcibly cut off a detained woman's hair weave, is getting her job back after an arbitrator exonerated her .

"An oil rig worker who was notoriously fired for saying he believed he saw MH370 'come down' today insisted he thinks the official search for the Malaysian jet is happening in the wrong place. In his first detailed interview since he sent out an email to officials relaying what he thought might be the Boeing 777 aircraft, Mike McKay, 57, told MailOnline: 'Almost a year has passed, but I stand by what I saw. 'I've thought about it and thought about it, over and over and while I cannot say for certain that the burning object in the sky was definitely MH370, the timing fits in with when the Malaysian plane lost contact. I have been trying to disprove that what I saw was the aeroplane ever since.' And so far he has failed to disprove it. Speaking at his Auckland home where he now sits out his days after losing his job as a result of sending out the email on his company computer on the rig off the south of Vietnam, Mr McKay said that everyone believed he had said with certainty that he saw MH370 crash in flames into the South China Sea. 'Unfortunately my words were misinterpreted. I was careful to say that I 'believed' I saw the aircraft come down. The email was never for public consumption. Grieving: Mr McKay spoke to MailOnline as a group of relatives of Chinese passengers arrived in Malaysia from Beijing on February 12 to demand answers from Malaysia Airlines and the government . Mr McKay said he has spent many months pondering what he had seen - and remains unmoved in his opinion that if he had observed a burning plane it must have gone down in the South China Sea . 'And if it was the plane that has been missing for so long, then the search in the southern Indian Ocean is clearly in the wrong place.' Mr McKay was speaking after a group of relatives of Chinese passengers who were on the plane arrived in Malaysia from Beijing to demand answers from Malaysia Airlines and the government. Among their demands was an answer to why the Malaysian government had announced recently that the fate of MH370 was an accident. Mr McKay told MailOnline he was in no position to say what had caused the object to burst into flames, but added: 'If it was MH370 I cannot imagine how it could have continued flying. It could only have come down in the South China Sea.' He had gone to bed on the oil rig Songa Mercur, located off the coast of the Vietnamese town of Vung Tau, at his usual time of around 7pm. 'I got up at around midnight Vietnam Time, which is one hour ahead of Malaysian time, and wandered around to an area at the back as usual for a cigarette and a coffee. It was a beautiful night with good visibility because it had been raining, which always tends to clear the air. 'It would have been some time after 1am (Malaysian Time) that I saw a sudden glow of fire above the horizon, which caught my immediate attention, although, of course I could not have known whether it was definitely an aircraft or not.' Mr McKay said he took no immediate action but when he learned the following day that MH370 was missing - when it should have flown on across southern Vietnam towards Beijing - he tried in vain to contact Malaysian and Vietnamese officials. Sighting: Mike McKay had gone to bed on the oil rig Songa Mercur (pictured), located off the coast of the Vietnamese town of Vung Tau, on the evening of March 7 last year at his usual time of around 7pm . On March 12 - three days after his sighting - he sent out an email to Vietnamese officials declaring: 'I believe I saw the Malaysian Airlines plane come down. The timing is right.' He described where he was writing from and gave his latitude and longitude bearings. He then added: 'I observed (the plane?) burning at high altitude on a compass bearing of 265 degrees to 275 degrees from our surface location.' He went on: 'While I observed the burning (plane) it appeared to be in ONE piece… . 'From when I first saw the burning (plane) until the flames went out (still at high altitude) was 10-15 seconds. There was no lateral movement, so it was either coming toward our location, stationary (falling) or going away from our location.' The general position of the object, he said, was south west of the normal flight paths of aircraft he and his co-workers saw every day and at a lower altitude than the normal flight paths. Mr McKay, who has worked in the oil and gas exploration industry for more than 30 years, said that since he was 'kicked off' the rig after his email went public and the computers became overloaded he has spent many months pondering what he had seen - and remains unmoved in his opinion that if he had observed a burning plane it must have gone down in the South China Sea. Evidence: Mr Wen Wancheng, whose son was on the flight, said the Malaysian government had no facts or legal basis for announcing what had happened to the plane . 'There's a lot about this whole affair that niggles me and I've considered numerous questions as to whether there has been a cover up or there has been a show of inefficiency. I learned that Malaysian military had picked up a possible signal over Penang (an island off the west coast of the Malaysian peninsular) but didn't report it immediately. 'Of course, if it was from the plane, it means that contrary to my belief that it had come down in the South China Sea it had managed to turn around and fly back across the mainland. 'But what has also annoyed me is the fact that the Vietnamese searchers were stood-down after performing one flight based on my observation before the whole search effort was moved to the other side of the peninsular.' Asked if he had a theory about what might have caused the fire, he said an incident that came to mind was an explosion in a similar aircraft that was on a runway at Cairo airport in 2011, which was caused by oxygen escaping from disabled tubing and catching fire. Mr McKay hasn't worked since losing his job. 'There's nothing out there. The price of oil has dropped below break-even in many places, so a lot of the upcoming projects have been shelved.' Because he did not want to become the centre of that circus, he laid low - but that then placed him at the centre of another controversy. Bloggers questioned why he had 'gone into hiding' while others suggested he did not even exist and that his entire email was a hoax. The official search, headed by Australia, is based on satellite readings which picked up pings from what was believed to have been MH370 . Accident: Relatives of passengers of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 held placards during a protest demanding to know why the Malaysian government had announced recently that the fate of MH370 was an accident . He ignored the international controversy and went to a police station in Auckland where he filed a report about his sighting. Police have agreed that he was treated as a credible witness. In Malaysia on Friday, a group of mainly Chinese relatives have arrived at Kuala Lumpur airport wearing red T-shirts bearing the slogan 'Pray for MH370'. They said they had come for answers and unfurled banners and placards, one of which read: 'Today it's us, tomorrow it could be you.' Kelly Wen, wife of one of the 239 passengers and crew on board the aircraft which lost contact on March 8, said the group had three main purposes for making the journey. They wanted to have a meeting with Malaysia Airlines officials and glean the latest information. They also wanted to know on what grounds the Department of Civil Aviation had described the disappearance as 'an accident'. And finally, said Ms Wen, they wanted to discuss financial matters with the airline in the hope that families who were facing difficulties could be helped. Mr Wen Wancheng, whose son was on the flight, said the Malaysian government had no facts or legal basis for announcing what had happened to the plane . 'There are no facts or legal basis for Malaysia to announce that Malaysia Airlines MH370 was an accident and that all passengers were killed..It doesn't have any legal standing,' he told Reuters. 'It's been nearly a year since the flight went missing and the families are suffering financial problems because we've been travelling to various places - including to here and to the family assistance centre in Beijing and we've spent a lot of money. 'The families are facing financial issues as much as emotional ones. We want Malaysia Airlines and Boeing to provide immediate payments to help us with these issues. 'All the relatives of the passengers have been trying to find out what happened to them.' Mr McKay's observation might be a clue - or might not, for he has only been able to relate what he saw. But many Chinese relatives continue to insist that there has been a cover-up for unknown reasons as the fruitless search goes on in the southern Indian Ocean. The Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre, which, headed by Australia, is conducting the search says that so far the underwater operations have scoured 22,000 square kilometres of the ocean bed, equalling around 36 per cent of the priority search area. It is estimated that if there are no delays with vessels, equipment or from the weather, the underwater search will be mostly finished some time in May. The 'Go Phoenix' supply ship has remained in the area, 2,500km to the south west of Perth, western Australia, but three vessels involved in the underwater search have this week suspended operations to return to port in Australia for scheduled visits. Despite months of searching in the area, there have been no sightings of debris on the surface or any clues that the aircraft is lying on the sea bed in region covered so far.","Mike McKay, 57, from New Zealand has spoken exclusively to MailOnline .

"Irresponsible dog owners' days could be numbered as a company which matches dogs to the DNA left behind in their mess is reportedly in talks with local councils. The PooPrints service works by building a DNA database of dogs in a particular area so any dog mess found can be quickly traced back to the offending animal - and its owner. It's already in use in many U.S. apartment complexes and condo buildings, where operators report very high compliance rates as dog owners know they will be unable to deny the offence. Poo time: But irresponsible dog owners' days could be numbered as a company which matches dogs to the DNA left behind in their mess is reportedly in talks with local councils to bring the service to the UK . And now north Wales-based biotech firm Streetkleen is in negotiations with about 15 councils - including Kingston-upon-Thames, Aberdeen and Cheshire East - to bring PooPrints to the UK. The company believes local authorities can use new powers granted by the Antisocial Behaviour and Policing Act 2014 to force dog owners to comply. Gary Downie, Streetkleen's managing director, told The Times said an order could be imposed with the condition that any dog using a particular public area must be DNA registered . Such registration, which involves swabbing the animal's cheek for a sample, costs about £30 and could be done at the same time as microchip implantation, he suggested. 'If you want to use a local park or canal towpath to exercise your dog, it seems reasonable to ask you to add its DNA to a database. Responsible dog owners have nothing to fear from this technology,' he told reporter Ben Webster. In the U.S. the technology has already been in use for several years, mainly in controlled, gated communities where access is only open to residents. Using a designated PooPrints collection kit, groundskeepers and apartment managers gather any evidence and send it off to PooPrints parent company, BioPet Vet Lab in Knoxville, Tennessee. There scientists test the DNA against all registered dogs to determine if a particular pile comes from one of a community’s dogs. It’s billed as a money-saving way for groups to cut down on excess excrement, protecting the environment and shoe soles alike. Under the proposals, dog owners would have to register their pets' DNA with the local authority . Opinions of the service, which requires upfront fees from resident dog owners and sometimes monthly fees thereafter, aren’t all positive. Dallas tenant Brian Barcus, speaking last year, said he was unhappy with his building’s decision to contract with PooPrints. ‘Everybody wants to live in a clean community,’ he told the Houston Chronicle. ‘I can see the intent behind the new rule, but I don't understand how they can force it upon us in the middle of our lease.’ Others, such as property managers, see it as a good way to keep their grounds clean. ‘I think it's a great idea,’ Houston-area leasing manager Molly Kalish said. ‘The main reason we decided to try this new program was because we had a specific issue on one of our floors with accidents.’ Back in Britain, Ken Moss, the councillor responsible for parks at Hyndburn Council, told The Times the technology would be most effective if the government were to introduce a national DNA database. 'The beauty of it is that there's no escape for the selfish owner,' he said.","The PooPrints service traces dogs - and owners - from DNA in their faeces .

The one thing I get frustrated by with would-be entrepreneurs is their desire to jump right in, and then give up within 6 months because they had not understood the amount of work it would take and the lag in time until turnover materialises. The reality is that it takes time to formulate a strong concept that can go to market. It’s crucial to test your idea on those that aren’t close to you, otherwise, you will be told your concept is brilliant, but when you go to market there is the potential that no one will buy it. The feeling of deflation can be overwhelming and may make you feel uncertain, but this can be somewhat avoided by testing the market prior to putting too much money into the concept. Taking your idea to social media is an effective way to gather instant and constructive feedback. Social media is an important tool to help test your product, receive feedback and gauge the public's reaction . Yes, people can be unbearably mean-spirited because they either dislike the product or because they love to troll but this can work in your favour if you are able to sift through the negativity. You quickly find out if your idea is really viable, if it needs to be tweaked or if your price point too high. We spent around eight months prior to launching The Big Smoke testing everything from audience acquisition to market positioning. Thirteen months in as a live site I am still testing, tweaking, learning and pivoting. It’s a never ending process that really never ceases no matter what stage your company matures to. Something what I find important to acknowledge, and many people don’t like to discuss, is that not everyone in your world will support you. Starting your own business is in some ways 'a leap of faith' (much like bungee-jumping!) but it can also be a slow burn, requiring a great deal of patience and perseverance . People are funny creatures, they battle with their own insecurities, disappointments and broken dreams – we all do. When they perceive you as launching something you are passionate about, they may even want to be happy for you but in my experience many fall to the wayside during the process. As hard as this may be, it’s a good thing to find out, because when the business is struggling or you are having a particularly hard time you want to confide in the right people. It can be a lonely journey, but you need good people around you, both to mourn with you during failures and to celebrate your successes. The process from idea to start-up can take many forms and there is no ‘one size fits all’ approach to getting it right. Ms Tselios recommends that a person starting their own business has a good group of people to support them, 'to mourn the disappointments and celebrate the successes' The truth is, not even the most experienced serial entrepreneur gets it right all the time. But if I can advise anyone starting out, it is to focus on your game as an ever-evolving process of learning, tweaking and adjusting to what the market wants, the customers’ need and the industry demands. But equally important, is to be resilient both with what you believe is right for your business, and having enough discernment to surround yourself with the right people. Growing a business can be hard, and it will take time, but those brave enough will get there eventually and find their rightful place in the start-up space. 'Sometimes, making that jump can involve taking out a second mortgage; a massive loan, or just starting small, whilst keeping a full time job'","Alexandra Tselios shares her tips for a successful start up business .

"Labour MP for Wansbeck in Northumberland Ian Lavery, who claims Ed Miliband's inner circle think people with northern accents are stupid . Ed Miliband’s inner circle think people with Northern accents are stupid, a Labour MP has claimed. Prominent Left-winger Ian Lavery said the party’s elite looked down on working-class supporters in the North. The Wansbeck MP, a former miner, said: ‘We’ve got an elite in Westminster which quite frankly frightens me. ‘They haven’t been anywhere or done anything, and when you’ve got an accent like mine they think, “well that man doesn’t really know too much”.’ His broadside follows claims by Tony Blair that Mr Miliband is leading the party to defeat. Mr Lavery, a former president of the National Union of Mineworkers who took part in the 1984-85 strike, spoke out at a conference organised by left-wing think-tank CLASS. He said too few of the Labour hierarchy in Westminster have done manual jobs, adding: ‘Sadly there’s not enough MPs who’ve actually worked on the coalface, on the factory floor.’ Last night Mr Lavery insisted his comments were about the need for more working-class MPs and ‘in no way a criticism’ of Mr Miliband or his office. He added in a statement: ‘For the record, I believe Ed Miliband is absolutely the right man to bring in policies that will be of great benefit to people in the North and across the country.’ However, his comments come as Labour MPs fight over the direction of the party following the critique by Mr Blair – who last night quickly backtracked over his remarks. In a swift U-turn, the former Labour PM gave Mr Miliband his full support – just hours after saying he expects the Labour leader to lose the election. Mr Blair sparked a backlash after warning that the party had been dragged to the Left and is on course for disaster at the polls. But he was forced to issue a denial within hours, saying his comments had been ‘misinterpreted’. He added on Twitter: ‘I fully support Ed and my party and expect a Labour victory in the election.’ Charlie Whelan, a former spin doctor for Gordon Brown, responded: ‘Don’t be surprised if no one believes you.’ Mr Blair had angered Labour high command after telling The Economist that the election was shaping up to be one ‘in which a traditional Left-wing party competes with a traditional Right-wing party, with the traditional result’. Asked if he meant a Tory win, Mr Blair replied: ‘Yes, that is what happens.’ But his intervention was a blow to the Labour leader, who is struggling to convince his own party that he can win the election. In a swift U-turn, former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair gave Mr Miliband, pictured,  his full support after appearing to suggest his party was on course for disaster at the polls . Blairite MP David Lammy yesterday said it was right to raise concerns about Labour’s direction and insisted Mr Blair’s comments should be taken ‘very seriously indeed’. But Lucy Powell, Mr Miliband’s election chief, yesterday dismissed the warning. Referring to Mr Blair, she said: ‘He has his experience from his era. That is not the era we now live in.’ Paul Kenny, general secretary of the GMB union, described Mr Blair’s views as ‘sad and disappointing’. Veteran Labour MP David Winnick said Mr Blair should remember the Clement Attlee quip ‘a period of silence on your part would be welcome’. A Labour victory in this year’s general election would spark economic ‘chaos’, David Cameron warns today. The Prime Minister will use his New Year message to say Labour’s addiction to borrowing poses ‘huge risks’ to an economy that is now on the mend – as experts predict wages are finally set to outstrip inflation this year. The Institute of Directors expects pay to rise by an average of 2 to 3 per cent in the next 12 months as company balance sheets improve. Meanwhile, the Centre for Economics and Business Research will today forecast that average prices could start to fall for the first time since 1960 because of the impact of cheaper oil. In his message, Mr Cameron will say Britain’s progress is at grave risk if Ed Miliband seizes power in May – either outright or as part of a coalition government. In a plea for a second term, he will claim the UK is being ‘turned around’ by the Tories, adding: ‘Britain has a choice between the competence that has got us this far or the chaos of giving it up, going backwards and taking huge risks.’","Labour MP Ian Lavery says party look down on working-class supporters .

"Burnt toast is one of life's little annoyances. But while most of us have dealt with charcoal-crusts by simply throwing out the slices and starting again, one designer decided to find a solution. Chaya Harntaweewongsa, of PLERN Studio in Thailand, has created a transparent toaster which lets you monitor your bread as it is browning. Thai designer Chaya Harntaweewongsa ingenious solution to avoid burnt toast features clear glass panels . The updated kitchen appliance is currently in its conceptual stage . This allows you to to keep an eye on the bread as it toasts, and remove it as soon as it reaches the desired levels of crispness. The updated kitchen appliance is currently in its conceptual stage and features all the same settings as a conventional machine. But this isn't the first time someone has thought of a see-through toaster. The world's first transparent toaster, Magimix's two-slice machine, took engineers 15 years to perfect . Belgium brand Kaloric's design also featured see-through panels on the side . The world's first transparent toaster, Magimix's two-slice machine, took engineers 15 years to perfect. The £160 Magimix Vision also featured clear side panels with easy to use controls and was launched in the UK four years ago. And earlier last year Belgium brand Kaloric unveiled their take on the traditional kitchen appliance, which also had transparent panels on the side. It takes exactly 216 seconds to cook perfect toast . Scientists revealed the mathematical formula for a perfect slice of toast, showing that it is best cooked for exactly 216 seconds. A team of researchers carried out a study which found the optimum thickness is 14mm and the ideal amount of butter is 0.44 grams per square inch. The recommended cooking time gives the slice a 'golden-brown' colour and the 'ultimate balance of external crunch and internal softness'. It has the look of 'builder's tea' and, crucially, the outside is 12 times crunchier than the middle. The result is achieved by setting the toaster dial to 'five out of six' on a typical 900-watt appliance to produce a temperature of 154 degrees Celsius. Bread expert Dr Dom Lane, a consultant food researcher, spent one week toasting and tasting a staggering 2,000 slices for his research, in his bid to assist the nation's toast eaters. We chomp our way through more than 94.2 million slices daily, though our enjoyment can be spoiled by burnt or soggy specimens. During his exhaustive study, commissioned by bread maker Vogel's, Dr Lane used a complex formula to help determine the toasting required to produce the perfect level of crispiness. He found that 216 seconds was the exact amount of time needed to toast the outside to the desired level before the golden 12:1 exterior/interior crispiness ratio was lost. He also discovered it was best to use a pale, seeded, loaf, taken fresh from the fridge at a temperature of 3 degrees Celsius. Both sides of the bread should be cooked at the same time, using a toaster rather than a grill, to help 'curtail excessive moisture loss'. It should then be buttered as soon as it pops up, before the slice loses the heat required to melt the spread. The cooked and buttered slice should be cut once, diagonally, and served on a plate warmed to 45 degrees Celsius, to minimise condensation beneath the toast. But it is important the plate is not too hot or it will continue the cooking process and ruin the perfectly formed slice.","Toaster created by Chaya Harntaweewongsa of PLERN Studio .

"Tesco has removed sweets and chocolate from all of its checkouts to reduce pester power and help families choose healthier food. The supermarket removed confectionery from larger stores 20 years ago but the changes that take effect today will apply to all stores in the UK and the Republic of Ireland including around 2,000 smaller Metro and Express outlets. A spokesman said confectionery would also be removed from areas adjacent to the tills - for example, racks of sweets at children's eye level next to checkout queues. Tesco has announced that it would remove all confectionery from its checkouts across the UK and Ireland . It follows research based on Tesco Club Card data that found families with young children have, on average, the least healthy shopping baskets, while pensioners and older adults are the healthiest shoppers. An earlier study by the grocer found nearly two-thirds (65 per cent) of customers said removing confectionery from checkouts would help them make healthier choices. Just over two-thirds of parents (67 per cent) said confectionery-free checkouts would help them make healthier choices for their children. Tesco's managing director of health and wellness, David Wood, said: 'Our customers told us that removing sweets and chocolates from checkouts would help them make healthier choices, so from today our checkouts will be sweet and chocolate-free zones. 'We hope this will make our customer's lives easier, as taking sweets and chocolates off the checkouts will really help parents with young children. 'As a parent of two young children myself, I know how challenging it can be to navigate the checkouts with children in tow. 'The response we've had from parents has been overwhelmingly positive, so it'll be interesting to see if other supermarkets follow our lead and do the same thing.' The retailer said it had replaced the confectionery with healthier snacks including dried fruit, nuts and cereal bars, and every food item on the checkout would be one of the 'five a day', have no red traffic light ratings, be in calorie-controlled snack packs or be deemed by the Department of Health to be a 'healthier snack'. The retailer said there would only be healthy snacks near the checkouts as a result of their policy decision . Justine Roberts, the chief executive of parenting website Mumsnet, said: 'Popping into a shop with a small child in tow can sometimes feel like navigating an assault course. 'If you've made it to the checkout in one piece it can be really frustrating to then be faced with an unhealthy array of sweets designed to tempt your child. 'It's really positive to see a supermarket responding to the views of their customers and trying to make life that little bit easier.' Public health minister Jane Ellison said: 'This is a very welcome move by Tesco, responding to the clear demands of their customers, and raising the bar in the roll out of healthy checkouts. 'This initiative will help people make healthier choices, which all contributes to reducing the long-term cost to our nation of obesity and ill-health.'","Tesco will remove all sweets from the checkouts of 2,000 stores .

"Disney's hit animated movie Frozen has topped yet another popularity chart, this time for the year's most-requested karaoke song. Let It Go, arguably the best-known track from the film, has been named as 2014's most popular song in a poll of karaoke crooners. Two different versions of the song, recorded by Idina Menzel and Demi Lovato, feature in the movie which earlier this year was named as the highest-grossing animated film of all time, taking close to $1 billion at the box office worldwide. Scroll down for video . Let It Go from the hit Disney film Frozen was the year's most popular karaoke song . Indeed, the movie's popularity has already seen it named as the year's best-selling DVD and album by Amazon, while a variety of other Frozen-themed merchandise, from toothbrushes and nail polish to dolls and umbrellas, sold out in stores around the world . Surprisingly, while both versions of the movie's title track have proved popular, neither have experienced the same global success as some of the film's other releases. Former X Factor judge Demi's version was released as a single but only reached number 38 in the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, while failing to even make it into the UK Top 40. Idina Menzel's version climbed slightly higher, peaking at number 5 in the Billboard Hot 100, and reaching number 11 in the UK. However, the song accounted for 15 per cent of the 3.5 million songs sung this year by users of UK-based karaoke company Lucky Voice Online Karaoke, well ahead of its nearest rival which was Happy by Pharrell Williams. 1.

According to the karaoke company's managing director, Nick Thistleton, no other karaoke song in history has ever experienced the same kind of success as Let It Go. 'We've never seen a song dominate like this - even the likes of Adele and Katy Perry don't come close to the popularity of Let It Go,' he said. 'Not only this, but we've seen a whole host of new Lucky Voice Online Karaoke customers as a result of adding this song. 'Let it Go might have failed to set the singles charts alight, but it's a clear winner as far as karaoke-loving Brits are concerned.'","The film's title track placed first on a list of the top ten most-requested songs .

"President Barack Obama has preached economic opportunity and equal access to education as cornerstones of the legacy he wants to leave behind. But in the contest to host his presidential library, two public universities that serve needy communities fear the playing field has been tilted against them by a pair of elite, private schools with seemingly endless money. University of Illinois at Chicago student trustee Danielle Leibowitz says her university has suspected that it's the underdog all along. A key player in her school's bid for the library, Leibowitz said the university wants to team up with a community foundation to build the library in North Lawndale, a blighted, heavily black neighborhood on the West Side. 'If he wants to be consistent with the message he's given throughout his presidency, it really only makes sense to give it to us,' Leibowitz said of Obama. 'To suddenly hand over your legacy to a private institution seems rather hypocritical.' View of the University of Illinois campus. President Barack Obama has preached economic opportunity and equal access to education as cornerstones of the legacy he says he wants to leave behind. But in the contest to host his presidential library, the Chicago-based university that serves a needy community fears the playing field has been tilted against it by a pair of elite, private schools with seemingly endless funding . This December 2013 photo shows one possible location in the Kakaako district of Honolulu to be considered for the Barack Obama Presidential Library. Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz said during a recent interview that his state can't compete financially with two others under consideration in New York and Chicago, but 'we bring different assets to the table' As Obama weighs a decision he'll announce within months, the University of Hawaii and the University of Illinois at Chicago are struggling to offer the upfront resources needed to offset the massive cost of building the library and presidential museum, expected to run close to half a billion dollars. The other two schools in the running, Columbia University, located in New York, and the University of Chicago, are both top-10 schools with a combined endowment of more than $15 billion. The Obamas are expected to raise much — but not all — of the money themselves, so a university's ability to contribute will be a major factor. The Barack Obama Foundation, which is screening proposals and will recommend a winner to Obama, has asked each school in the running for explicit details about what financial and other resources they can bring to bear. 'Look, when it comes to raw fundraising prowess, we're not in a position to compete with New York and Chicago,' Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz said during a recent interview in his Honolulu office, overlooking the panoramic, oceanfront site that Hawaii has proposed for the library. 'We bring different assets to the table. But if the question is who can raise more money, Honolulu's going to come in third,' he added. President Barack Obama golfs with friends Greg Orme, left, and Mike Ramos, right, on Monday at the Mid Pacific Country Club in Kailua, Hawaii during his  family vacation in the state in which he was born and raised. Obama will decide whether or not to build his presidential library in Hawaii early in the New Year . View of Columbia University campus in New York City, another school under consideration to house Obama's library. Columbia is a top-10 school with an endowment that ranges in the billions . In an unusual move this week, the Obama foundation let it be known that it was displeased with Chicago's proposals. The University of Chicago, a private school near Obama's South Side home, has long been perceived as a front-runner due to its close ties to the Obamas. But the three sites the university has proposed are on Chicago Park District land, and the university can't prove it could secure the land if it was selected, the person said. Still, the blunt warning through the media appeared designed mainly to light a fire under the university to fill holes in its proposal, and Mayor Rahm Emanuel's office quickly stepped in to say the city was working to acquire the land for the library's use. 'The mayor is committed to bringing the library home to Chicago, and we continue to work with the foundation to ensure all Chicago bids remain competitive,' said David Spielfogel, the mayor's senior adviser. Although the park district's board president, Bryan Traubert, is married to Obama's longtime friend and Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker, Traubert has recused himself. Other attempts to build on park land have drawn consternation from groups like Friends of the Parks. The group sued to block Star Wars creator George Lucas from building a museum on park acreage. One potential option could be for city to acquire the land from the park district if Chicago is picked for the library. The city could return the property to the park system if another bid is selected. Spielfogel said all options were being considered but that Emanuel will 'only consider potential sites that ensure park land remains under public control and that the surrounding communities have a say in the process.' Chicago's other proposal, from the public University of Illinois at Chicago, was also met with scrutiny by Obama's foundation. The board of directors raised questions about how changes in leadership will affect the school's future, the person said. The campus and University of Illinois system are expected to have a new president, chancellor and board chairman within the next year. The person wasn't authorized to comment publicly and demanded anonymity to the Associated Press. The University of Illinois said that Obama's foundation 'should feel confident in the university leadership's ongoing support,' adding that the incoming Illinois governor will fill vacant trustee slots in January. The University of Chicago declined to comment for AP's report. The University of Chicago, a private school near Obama's South Side home, has long been perceived as a front-runner due to its close ties to the Obamas. But the three sites the university has proposed are on Chicago Park District land, and the university can't prove it could secure the land if it was selected, a person familiar with the selection process said this week . The Obama foundation said each school has its own unique strengths and regardless of which school is chosen, the foundation will be able to raise the needed money. 'The foundation is looking at each response as a complete package and will choose a partner which, on balance, offers the best opportunity to create an outstanding presidential library and museum,' the foundation said in a statement. As public, taxpayer-funded institutions, the University of Illinois and the University of Hawaii face legal and practical limitations on how much they can contribute to a project such as Obama's library. Nevertheless, both schools have sought to show they're eager to do what they can. Hawaii lawmakers have expressed interest in having the state pitch in, while the foundation partnering with the University of Illinois has pledged $5 million. Obama was born in Hawaii and started his family and political career in Illinois. He went to college in New York. Columbia and the University of Chicago have been coy about what they're offering. But people familiar with those schools' proposals, who weren't authorized to comment publicly and requested anonymity, said both schools are prepared to absorb a substantial chunk of the cost themselves. They're also working to secure attractive real estate where the library can be built. Although the foundation has tapped Julianna Smoot, a major Democratic fundraiser and former Obama campaign official, to direct fundraising, the foundation's board has said it won't start seriously raising money to build the library until much later. The Obamas have pledged not to solicit donations until after they leave office, even though they will select a site early in 2015. Meantime, the question of what message Obama wants his library to convey has grown more pronounced as the economic recovery continues to leave many behind. Marcus Betts, a spokesman for the North Lawndale Presidential Library Committee, said Obama has a rare opportunity to show that one's background need not predetermine one's ability to succeed. 'If you think about what Martin Luther King Jr. would do, where he would put a project like this, I think the answer becomes very clear,' Betts said. 'It really boils down to the have and the have-nots.'","University of Illinois at Chicago student trustee Danielle Leibowitz says her public institution suspects it's the underdog; the university wants to build the library in a blighted, heavily black neighborhood on the West Side .

"You may be wasting your time making home-made egg-nog and mince pies this Christmas. Researchers have found the most memorable ingredient of a good spread is the company around the table. The study has found that inviting good guests can make even make an everyday dinner transform into a feast, even if the food is quickly thrown together. Researchers have found that a memorable meal does not automatically require sophisticated food . Lead author Dr Betina Piqueras-Fiszman said: ‘A memorable meal is not necessarily linked with sophisticated foods or elaborate events. ‘In fact, some meals were spontaneous or the foods very simple. However, it was often reported that, regardless of the type of food, the meal was really tasty. ‘This suggests that the rest of contextual factors might have contributed to make the food ‘taste’ very good, or at least to it being remembered as such.’ The researchers from Wageningen University in the Netherlands interviewed 886 people in Britain for an online survey. Diners were asked to recall a memorable meal and to rate each aspect on a scale of one to seven. The research, published in the journal Food Research International, found who you are with was rated the most important factor, followed closely by what you eat and drink. The researchers found that simple food was more than enough if the invited guests were suitably entertaining . The atmosphere came third and the mood of the diner came in fourth. The type of meal was fifth, followed by other activities taking place and then how often these memorable occasions take place. Meals which are memorable for the occasion, such as Christmas dinners, weddings and birthdays, were excluded from the survey. Dr Piqueras-Fiszman added: ‘Overall, the most important aspects of memorable meals were the company - who else was present during the memorable meal. ‘We would like to emphasise that memorable meals, as occasions that are often and positively remembered by consumers, seem to include a dimension related to emotions and overall well-being. ‘In this body of evidence, this component was reflected in the expressions used by the consumers and in the high importance ratings given to how they felt emotionally during that occasion.’","Entertaining guests are more important than good food researchers claim .

"Craig Stockham, 33, (pictured) from Flintshire, abused his position as finance director at LiveWire and Culture Warrington to siphon thousands of pounds into his bank account to fund his drug habit . A finance boss stole nearly £30,000 of taxpayers' money to fund his £150-a-day cocaine habit, a court heard. Craig Stockham abused his position as finance director of two non-profit organisations to siphon thousands of pounds of  into his own bank account. The 33-year-old, from Flintshire, Wales, was caught out by colleagues on his last week of work at LiveWire and Culture Warrington, which provides and manages leisure services for Warrington Borough Council. Halton Magistrates' Court, in Cheshire, heard how he stole about £28,670 from the organisations between January and November before using it to fund his cocaine habit. Stockham, who was dressed in a grey suit, striped shirt and blue tie, admitted theft at the court hearing yesterday and the case was sent to Warrington Crown Court, where he will be sentenced at later date. During the hearing, magistrates heard how Stockham was recently promoted to his senior role - which gave him access to funds and the responsibility of making strategic management decisions – after being taken on by the groups when they were founded in 2012. He was set to receive a severance package after working his last day, on what would have been November 18, but was instead immediately suspended, without pay, just a few days prior after colleagues discovered missing funds. It was only when a fellow colleague asked a worker to double check one of Stockham's payments that his actions come to light. After investigating the payment further, the worker discovered that Stockham had made one payment to a separate bank account, which was found to be his own. Following a review, it was found that he stole around £24,000 from LiveWire and £4,670 from Culture Warrington, the court heard. LiveWire runs former council-owned Warrington leisure centre while Culture Warrington manages the Parr Hall and Warrington Museum. When arrested on November 12, he tested positive for cocaine and police found paperwork in his room which showed that he was in debt. Prosecuting, Alison Warburton, said: 'He had a cocaine habit, he was spending around £150 on cocaine a day. 'He had access to spending a lot of the budget. It is a very serious breach of trust.' The companies insist appropriate financial systems and procedures were in place and have slammed the 'devastating' effects of Stockham's actions.

A date has not yet been fixed for the next hearing . Speaking after yesterday's court hearing, Jan Souness, managing director for both LiveWire and Culture Warrington, said: 'As finance director, Craig was a trusted and valued member of our senior management team. 'He came to us with impeccable references and was a unanimous choice when he was appointed. 'He was popular among peers and was one of the original team. 'We worked hard to support each other and we thought there was strong trust and transparency among us. 'His actions had a devastating impact on the team in terms of his betrayal of his office, his colleagues, the board and the people of Warrington whom we in LiveWire and Culture Warrington endeavour to serve to the best of our ability. 'Whilst we are insured for the loss and so the impact on both companies in a material sense is minimal, it is the sense of betrayal that has been the hardest to cope with. 'I’m proud to say that the teams across both organisations have pulled together to ensure the continued high standards of service to our customers.' Defence barrister Nick Terry advised the magistrates to send the case to the crown court. A date has not yet been fixed for sentencing.","Craig Stockham abused his position as finance director to siphon funds .

"Florida Sen. Marco Rubio now says he would be 'open' to blocking a pathway to citizenship for immigrants who entered the country improperly. While he continues to favor legislation that would create opportunities for illegal immigrants to become U.S. citizens, Rubio told the New York Times that he would be willing to entertain legislation that allows for permanent residency but not citizenship in order to get conservatives on board with changes to the current system. 'We might prohibit people who came here illegally and got green cards under this process from ever becoming citizens. And if that’s what we have to do to get this thing passed, I would be open to it,' he told the Times during an interview published on Wednesday. 'But I don’t think that’s a wise thing to do,' he added. While he continues to favor legislation that would create opportunities for illegal immigrants to become U.S. citizens, Rubio says that he would be willing to entertain legislation that allows for permanent residency but not citizenship for immigrants in order to get conservatives on board with changes to the current system . As a freshman senator Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, embraced the issue of immigration and joined onto efforts to pass comprehensive reforms led by a bipartisan group of senators known as the Gang of Eight that included Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and John McCain and Jeff Flake of Arizona. The bill passed in the Democrat-controlled Senate in mid 2013 but never made it the floor of the House before the end of the 113th session of Congress. Confronted with the political reality that comprehensive reform won't pass the GOP-run House of Representatives, Rubio has since withdrawn his support for a comprehensive bill and has latched on to the piecemeal approach touted by House Speaker John Boehner. 'An ""all or nothing"" strategy on immigration reform would result in nothing,' Rubio's spokesman, Alex Conant, told ABC News last year. 'What is keeping us from progress on a series of immigration issues on which there is strong consensus is the fear that a conference committee on a limited bill will be used to negotiate a comprehensive one. We should take that option off the table so that we can begin to move on the things we agree on,' he said. At a gathering of conservative activists in August, Rubio made a similar point after he was heckled by immigration advocates who accused him of wanting to deport them. 'I’ve been there, I tried it, it doesn’t work. You are not going to have the support in Congress for the sort of comprehensive approach they’re insisting upon,' he told a reporter for U.S. News. 'And I think the approach they’ve taken, that they have some sort of right, is the wrong approach. I actually think it sets back the cause,' he said. Conant confirmed to DailyMail.com today that the senator 'stands by' the principles in the Gang of Eight bill and believes that immigration reform legislation should include language that allows 'qualifying illegal immigrants' to obtain green cards and eventually become U.S. citizens. Rubio would, however, be more strict with the qualifications for permanent residency, Conant explained, stressing that the Senate's immigration bill was compromise legislation. And 'if it's impossible to pass that sort of reform, he would be open to reform that allowed for permanent residence but not citizenship for illegal immigrants,' Conant said. Illegal immigrants with serious criminal histories and those who arrived in the last several years would not qualify under the law and would be subject to immediate removal. Protesters shout at Rubio as supporters try to usher them away during during a BBQ hosted by Rep. Jeff Duncan in Anderson, South Carolina, in August. The immigration advocates accused him of wanting to deport them . Rubio is pictured here with other members of the Senate's 'Gang on Eight' during an April 18, 2013 press conference to introduce their comprehensive immigration bill. Pictured alongside Rubio are, from left to right, Arizona Republican Jeff Flake, New York Democrat Chuck Schumer, Arizona Republican John McCain, Colorado Democrat Michael Bennet and Illinois Democrat Dick Durbin . While Rubio would like to see Congress take on immigration on the next legislative session, the possible presidential candidate poured cold water on the notion that the Republican Party must pass immigration reforms before 2016 in order to remain political viable in that year's elections. 'Those who argue that this will be a bonanza for Republicans are not telling the truth,' the Florida senator told the New York Times. 'Those who argue that we should do it for the purpose of politics are also misanalyzing the issue' Rubio's comments were an direct jab shot across the bow at pundits and lawmakers, like fellow Gang of Eight member Graham, who have argued that in order to woo the growing Hispanic-American population, the Republican Party must embrace immigration reform. 'If we don't at least make a down payment on solving the problem and rationally dealing' with the roughly 11 million illegal immigrants residing in the country, 'if we become the party of self-deportation in 2015 and 2016, then the chance of winning the White House I think is almost nonexistent,' Graham said on CNN's State of the Union last Sunday. Graham lauded former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's foray into the 2016 presidential race, calling him an 'excellent candidate' who has 'rational, logical views on immigration.' 'This primary is wide open,' though, he said. Rubio told the Times that he was still 'weighing' his own presidential campaign and repeated previous claims that friend and fellow Floridian Bush's entry into the race would have no effect on his decision. 'If I don’t run, it won’t be because Jeb is running,' he said. 'Maybe if you’re going to run for county commissioner or to be on the Mosquito Abatement Board or something like that, you may not want to run against a friend of yours,' he said. 'We certainly know a lot of the same people; we also know some different people. I don’t believe if I decide to run for president that that will be an impediment,' Rubio said in a separate NPR interview that also came out today. As far as an announcement is concerned, Rubio told NPR that he is 'closer to a decision than we were a month ago' but gave no indication of which way he is leaning.","'But I don’t think that’s a wise thing to do,' he added .

"For one father, trying to make the best of his daughter's eye problem is as simple as being creative with a marker pen. Layla Grubb, 11 months, was born with a cataract in her right eye so she must wear a patch on her left eye for two hours a day to strengthen it. So her father Geoffrey Grubb, 31, from the Midwest, US,  simply draws a new design on her patch every day 'to make it fun' and takes a picture. Little Layla Grubb, 11 months, must wear a patch for two hours a day to help strengthen  her right eye . Creative father Geoffrey Grubb draws fun designs such as a flower, left, or a bug, on Layla's eye patches . Layla gets half a pair of spectacles just like her father Geoffrey Grubb, who took the enchanting snaps . The adorable baby was born with a small cataract that affects the sight in her right eye so in order to help the injured eye develop properly, she has worn a patch over her stronger eye for two months. She won't need surgery and the family hope patching will be enough but she will continue to have to wear one until she's four or five years old. Stay-at-home father Geoffrey said he quickly came up with the idea to decorate them. 'We bought some patches for her and they were a little weird to look at, so I started drawing on them the next day to make it more fun for both of us,' he said. 'She's too young to really know what's going on but I always show her the pictures before I put it on. She likes the pictures but she's much happier when it's time to take it off.' The adorable baby was born with a cataract in her right eye, so the patch helps her vision develop correctly . When it's cold, Layla gets a patch decorated with a snowman complete with top hat and carrot nose . Seeing out of one eye doesn't slow Layla down. She looks playful  with   cartoon characters on her patch . In the pictures, Layla certainly seems a very sunny baby and always has a big smile. Geoffrey takes pictures of Layla every day and sends them to his family. He has drawn a range of designs on her skin-coloured patches including eyes inspired by  Spider-Man, Bishop from X Men, Catwoman, as well as a heart and a floating balloon. And so far he has come up with original drawing every day. He said: 'The designs are mostly pop culture things that I think will be funny or cute. I haven't repeated any yet and I snap a picture with my iPhone every day. It even doubles as a name badge! Geoffrey writes his daughter's name in block capitals and colours them red . Layla channels Long John Silver with this traditional black patch drawn on the skin-coloured medical one . Bishop from X Men provides inspiration for this design - which isn't interfering in Layla's story time one bit . Babies and toddlers wear patches to help the eye send correct messages to the brain to prevent a lazy eye from developing. This occurs when the vision in one eye doesn't fully develop during childhood and can't necessarily be corrected with glasses in later life. Geoffrey posted the pictures and Layla's predicament on the social media website Reddit, noting that she often rubs her patch and gets irritable. His fellow users offered messages of support about their own experiences of wearing eye patches and some invaluable advice. Geoffrey said: 'The best advice I received was to put a little Vaseline on her eyebrow so the patch doesn't rip her hair out when I take it off. I thought that was genius.'

"This is the moment the final passengers were winched to safety off of a burning Greek ferry after being trapped for nearly 36 hours adrift in the  Adriatic Sea. Around 400 passengers were trapped on the deck of the Norman Atlantic after a fire started on a car deck before tearing through the rest of the ship. At least 11 died as emergency workers struggled through wind and rain-lashed seas to mount a daring rescue operation, which largely took place in the dark. The dramatic images were revealed today as it was alleged the Italian crew were among the first to flee in the ship's lifeboats, leaving women and children behind. Scroll down for video . To the rescue: This is the moment the last survivors of the Greek ferry fire were airlifted from the deck of the vessel after spending 36 hours in the wind and rain when a fire ripped through the car deck below . Desperate: At least 11 people are thought to have died after acrid smoke filled the cabins on the overnight ferry, causing panic, amid allegations that the staff were among the first to leave . Trapped: Around 400 people had to be airlifted from the ship during the night of December 28 after ropes on board the ship were not strong enough to attach it to a tug-boat . Nick Channing-Williams was on board the  vessel with Greek fiancee Regina Theoffili when the fire broke out below deck. The 37-year-old, who has now returned home in Berkshire, said he and a group of other passengers attempted to connect tow ropes from a tug boat to the ferry when the crew were nowhere to be found. He told The Times: 'There were no crew members down there - it was just us. I couldn't work that out. From what I understood, some of the crew members bailed out at the beginning.' Mr Channing-Williams added that some crew members had 'got off with the first lifeboats'. He said: 'There were so many women and children left on the boat. Why were they not the first in line to get on the lifeboat? Struggle: Survivors of the ferry fire huddle together on the deck while the ship continues to burn around them, 36 hours after the blaze started . Up in smoke: Images taken from the front of the ship, on top of the bridge, shows the lower decks consumed by smoke and fire which left at least 11 people dead . Panic: This image, taken below deck on the Norman Atlantic, shows smoke filling the corridors as passengers struggle to escape the burning ship . Abandoned: Witnesses say they were woken in their cabins by the smoke, and received almost no advice from cabin crew while trying to make their escape . 'It was just chaos. And I think there should be a few people with their heads a bit low. 'From what I understood, the ropes on board the ship were not good enough to tow it. They (the crew on the bridge) were screaming at us 'quicker, quicker'. 'Regina was getting very frustrated with them. She was like ""why don't you go down there?""' A spokesman for Anek Lines told the paper: 'It is too early now to deal with responsibilities about the accident. I don't have any evidence that the crew left before the passengers.' The blaze broke out on the car deck on Sunday while the ferry was travelling from the Greek port of Patras to Ancona in Italy. Safe at last: A woman is helped on to a stretcher at the port of Taranto in Italy. Witnesses describe survivors huddling together on the top deck to avoid the heat coming through the floor from the fire . Saved: A medic wraps a blanket around one of the ferry survivors who stood for hours in freezing wind and driving rain in little clothing after they fled their cabins . On dry land: A cargo boat which helped to take some of the shaken passengers to shore unloads them as medics wait to treat them on the quayside . The fire caused thick, acrid smoke to fill cabins, waking passengers on the overnight ferry. In the chaos that followed, passengers reported receiving virtually no instructions from the crew. The principle of women and children first appeared to go out of the window, and passengers started pushing and shoving and came to blows over seats in the lifeboats and helicopter baskets. There is still confusion over the numbers of people on board, prompting fears from Italian prosecutors that more bodies may be found once the ship is recovered from the Adriatic Sea. The names of some survivors were not on the manifest and some passengers listed might not have boarded, officials said. A total of 427 people were rescued, while Anek Lines said there were 475 on board. In an inspection just days before the disaster, the ship was found to have failings with fire safety and its plans for how to handle passengers in the event of an emergency.

"When you stop off at a service station on a motorway, you hardly expect five-star facilities. In fact the experience can often be somewhat traumatic. But one tourist was very pleasantly surprised when he called in at a Shell garage in Bohol, the Philippines. In fact, the toilets at this very unusual gas station were so top-notch that model and writer Jason Godfrey declared them better than his whole apartment. The model films himself to present the bizarre toilet to viewers and uploaded it to his Facebook page, before posting it on YouTube - where it has received nearly two million views. Introducing the unexpected find, Jason explains: 'I'm at a Shell station and I want to take you to a toilet here because the toilet at this Shell station is ridiculous.' He adds: 'I never make videos really and post them but I had to make a video about this and it's about a toilet. Whatever.' Jason Godfrey filmed a tour of the toilet as he couldn't believe the level of luxury at a gas station . The toilet looks more like a lounge, with magazines, books and framed pictures on the walls . Walking in through the unassuming door, Jason pans around the toilet to show mahogany panelling, table lamps, low lighting, bookshelves stacked with magazines and even shells and model boats on a mantlepiece. Jason goes on to say: 'This is the shell toilet. Look at it! 'And I can't capture the smell but it's super menthol in here.' As the camera shows the details of the bathroom - which looks more like a relaxing lounge - Jason adds: 'This toilet is better than my room, it's better than my entire toilet actually.' Ornaments on the mantlepiece, toiletries and a huge mirror complete the look in the bathroom . And in case you were in any doubt, Jason shows that it is indeed a real toilet . He ends his update with the advice: 'So if you're looking for a toilet anywhere then try to find this Shell station. Crazy.' Viewers posted comments about their surprise that such a clean gas station toilet could exist. Mark Stewart said: 'I would totally go to that shell station. This is how you treat your customers right.'

"The administrators of collapsed courier firm City Link have announced 2,356 redundancies after a rescue bid to buy the company failed. Many of the company's staff found out about its collapse on Christmas Day and had been warned to expect 'substantial redundancies'. There had been a small degree of hope earlier today after Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT union, disclosed unconfirmed details of a possible rescue, with Business Secretary Vince Cable said to be aware of developments. A picket line outside a City Link in Motherwell yesterday as staff came to terms with the fact they were likely to lose their jobs . Today administrators announced ,356 redundancies after a rescue bid to buy the company failed. Pictured are staff demonstrating at a City Link depot in North Lanarkshire yesterday . But the bid was deemed unacceptable and administrators Ernst & Young announced that 2,356 jobs at the parcel delivery firm were to be lost. The administrators said 371 people have been retained to deal with remaining parcels and to assist in realising the Company's assets and winding down its operations. Ernst and Young said the offer made by a consortium 'offered no money up front and significantly undervalued the assets to be acquired'. They said: 'The administrators proposed an alternative structure that would be acceptable and common in these situations. 'The consortium, despite attempts to make them reconsider, declined to amend their original offer.' The redundancies will affect the head office in Coventry as well as hubs and depots around the country. There will be 468 job losses in 'Central Functions', which includes head office staff, and a further 279 staff will lose their jobs in the Coventry hub. The remaining redundancies relate to a number of different hubs and depots across the UK. Hunter Kelly, joint administrator of City Link Limited, said: 'It is with regret that we have to announce substantial redundancies at City Link Limited, which ceased accepting new parcels on 24 December 2014. The company endured substantial losses in the run up to Christmas and announced they were entering administration on Christmas Day . 'The company endured substantial losses, which ultimately became too great for it to continue as a going concern, and City Link Limited entered administration following an unsuccessful sale process. 'At meetings across City Link Limited's UK sites on Monday 29 December 2014 and Tuesday 30 December 2014, employees were informed that there would be substantial redundancies as no new business was being taken on. 'Many of these employees were sent home, and informed that they would shortly receive formal correspondence to confirm their work status.' Business Secretary Vince Cable said: ""This is very sad news for the City Link workers and their families at a particularly difficult time of year. ""The Government has put arrangements in place to help employees who are made redundant and we stand ready to help. ""City Link employees and self-employed drivers who have their contracts terminated as a result of City Link's administration will be able to access the Government's rapid response service, which draws together local partners such as Jobcentre Plus and the skills bodies to deliver support for each person affected. ""In addition, a Facebook page has been set-up to link up companies holding suitable vacancies with those who have been made redundant, so if drivers can be redeployed into new jobs in this competitive buoyant market they will be."" Meanwhile the RMT union said the failure to secure jobs was a 'a disgraceful and cynical betrayal'. Secretary General Mr Cash said: 'The confirmation from the administrators that they have just sacked 2400 staff and are pulling the plug on any efforts to save City Link is a disgraceful and cynical betrayal that will wreck the lives of our members, many of whom are owed thousands of pounds. 'RMT does not believe that those pulling the strings had any interest in saving this business and were happy to cut and run leaving a trail of human misery in their wake. The City Link collapse has blown the lid off the cosy relationship between bandit capitalism and the political elite. Administrators estimate that around 30,000 parcels are still being held at City Link's 53 depots around the country . 'RMT will continue to advise and represent our members caught in this corporate failure. Those responsible will slink away with their own resources ring fenced and leaving the taxpayer to pick up the redundancy tab. The City Link Christmas destruction is an act of industrial vandalism that shames our nation while the Government looked on and offered nothing but hollow words.' While Scottish Labour's shadow cabinet secretary for finance, Jackie Baillie MSP, said: 'Our first thoughts are with the workers and their families who have found out that they have lost their jobs. This is a terrible way for them to start the New Year. 'It is essential that the Scottish Government now sends in a task force to provide the highest level and best quality support to the people who have been made redundant. Many of these City Link depots are located in parts of Scotland that already have high levels of unemployment. They cannot afford more people out of work. 'The first duty of the Scottish Government now is to find work for these men and women, including retraining them for other opportunities.' Yesterday staff returned to City Link depots for the first time since the news of the company's collapse broke on Christmas Day. It saw protests held by staff and RMT union members outside a number of City Link depots across the country. Jon Moulton said the directors of Better Capital, which owned the parcel delivery firm, were 'very sorry' about its collapse and the 'horrible effects' for its workforce. Customers who have sent parcels and intended recipients are being advised that depots remain open for items to be picked up (file picture) The veteran venture capitalist claimed that taxpayers would not foot 'much of a bill' for redundancy payments for the firm's staff as City Link has 'paid a fortune' in taxes since Better Capital took it over in April 2013. Administrators estimate that around 30,000 parcels are still being held at City Link's 53 depots around the country. Customers who have sent parcels and intended recipients are being advised that depots remain open for items to be picked up between 8am and 8pm. Ernst & Young said in a statement: 'The volume of parcels currently in the City Link network is low, and all depots will be open until approximately January 6. 'Customers and recipients can locate which depot their parcel is being held in using the City Link website.'","Administrators have announced 2,356 redundancies at City Link .

"Fast food chain Pie Face will continue to operate, but the new deal will see many creditors lose up to 86 cents in the dollar. ABC reported that creditors struck a deal during a lengthy meeting on Monday that will keep the company going, while much of the existing management team will continue to run the business. The administrators for the company, Jirsch Sutherland, said around $7.5 million has been earmarked for the deed of company arrangement (DOCA) that will pay back the firm's unsecured creditors. Pie Face was founded in 2003 with the first 20 stores opening within the first five years of the company's launch . That includes $2.8 million upfront, with a further $4.7 million expected over the next three years from future trading. Secured creditors will be paid outside the DOCA arrangements. The result of the deal is that those owed professional or trading costs will be paid in full, as will any employee claims. However, other unsecured creditors, such as suppliers to Pie Face, can only expect to receive between 14-19 cents in the dollar on what they are owed. To make matters worse some will be waiting up to three years to receive that. Managing partner of Jirsch Sutherland, Sule Arnautovic, told ABC News Online that only around five Pie Face creditors were opposed to the deal, who were mainly terminated employees who wanted access to their entitlements sooner under the Federal Government's redundancy scheme for collapsed companies than when they will receive full payment under the DOCA. Mr Arnautovic said around 20 Pie Face outlets have been closed since his firm was called in to take control of the struggling company, and about 150 staff have been laid off. The founder of Pie Face, former Wall Street banker Wayne Homschek, said sections of the franchise, were 'still profitable' Despite insisting that it was 'business as usual' following their restructure announcement, 19 Pie Face stores closed last week while Fairfax reports that the company owes $20 million to its creditors. The founder of Pie Face, former Wall Street banker Wayne Homschek, gave his global company over to the advisory and consulting firm, Jirsch Sutherland, who were 'conducting a review of operations'. Rod Sutherland from Jirsch Sutherland confirmed that some of the company's stores were losing money. However, Mr Homschek told Fairfax that sections of the franchise, which is known to sell meat pies, pastries and sandwiches until the early hours of the morning, were 'still profitable'. Pie Face was founded in 2003 with the first 20 stores opening within the first five years of the company's launch. The company assured that their 'international businesses are not affected' as two stores prepared to open in the Middle East in November.

"Labour has been accused of embarking on '1970s class war' with attacks on private education by one of the country's leading private school headteachers. Alun Jones, principal of St Gabriel's in Newbury, argued that referring to independent schools as bastions of 'elite and privilege' is outdated. And he claimed some parents pay far more by moving house or hiring private tutors to keep their children in state schools. Scroll down for video . Private school head Alun Jones hit back at Labour's education spokesman Tristram Hunt (pictured) over claims independent schools are a bastion of elite and privilege . Mr Jones is the new president of the Girls' Schools Association (GSA), and the first man to be appointed to the post. Speaking before taking up the role, he warned against 'outdated' perceptions of private schooling. Labour's education spokesman Tristram Hunt was accused of launching a class war  last month after he warned public schools they must do more to work with state schools or lose tax breaks worth £70million by 2020. He faced a furious backlash for turning education into a 'class issue', with even the headteacher at his old school condemning his 'offensive bigotry'. Mr Hunt, 40, attended University College School in Hampstead, north London, where a place costs £17,835-a-year. He went on to study history at Trinity College, Cambridge and the University of Chicago. His father, Lord Hunt of Chesterton, went to fee-paying Westminster School and is a former chief executive of the Met Office who was given a seat in the Lords by Tony Blair. Critics accused Mr Hunt of trying to make it harder for others to have the choice that he and his parents had. Mr Jones insisted that it is time to banish 'stereotypical, out-of-date' references to the independent sector. 'It's going back to the old 1970s class war, it's so outdated, the reference to the independent sector as that type of elite and privilege.' He added: 'My school, like many, many other GSA schools, are real world schools where mum and dad are working very hard to prioritise their income to benefit their children. 'And it's funny, I would say 80 per cent of the social apartheid one sees in schools at the moment is actually because of geography, and some parents can access incredible education and incredibly successful schools because they can afford incredibly expensive housing in expensive areas of the country.' Mr Jones, principal of St Gabriel's in Newbury (pictured), is the new president of the Girls' Schools Association (GSA), and the first man to be appointed to the post . There is a question over what is the greatest privilege - paying school fees or moving into an expensive area, Mr Jones said. 'Some parents will actually prioritise their household income in order to make significant sacrifices to send their children to independent school, other parents will choose to look at geographical locations of where to buy and will be able to afford incredibly expensive housing in what they consider to be a far better school area. 'They supplement this with tutors and extra lessons in all sorts of other activities.' This does mean that some state schools 'can end up being more exclusive than many independent schools', Mr Jones said. But Mr Hunt rejected the claims. 'There is more to be done to share facilities, insights and expertise between the state and private sectors. We would not be setting up any new quangos,' he told The Guadrian. 'We will ask the independent schools inspectorate to ensure that exactly the type of successful partnership St Gabriel's has developed is emulated across the sector.'","Alun Jones slams outdated view of independent schools being elite .

"Stephen Starkey, pictured some years ago, died after he was attacked in his own home when he was robbed on Christmas Day morning . A disabled man has died after being attacked by burglars at his home on Christmas Day. Father-of-four Stephen Starkey, 61, was alone on Christmas morning when he answered the door at 10.30am. He was beaten by a man who made off with a PlayStation 3 games console and some cash. Derek Wilkinson, 80, a friend and neighbour, said Mr Starkey, pictured below, knocked on his door and told him he’d been attacked. He added: ‘He was in a rough state and had been knocked about. He had bruises on his head and looked very groggy.’ Mr Starkey, who lived alone in his mid-terrace house on an estate in the Greenhill area of Sheffield, managed to walk to the ambulance when paramedics arrived and was taken to hospital. Mr Wilkinson said his friend had an injured shoulder and bruising on his forehead, but did not seem gravely hurt. He said: ‘There is no way I thought he was going to die. I rang the hospital and I was told he was in a poorly condition. The next thing I know he has died.’ A 40-year-old man was arrested over the incident last night, while a 37-year-old man has been questioned and bailed. Neighbours paid tribute to Mr Starkey, a Navy veteran and retired caretaker who had been married three times and had three grown-up daughters and a son. He was in poor health and disabled and had been targeted previously, having been robbed in a similar raid in October last year. The stolen console was believed to have belonged to Mr Starkey and was not thought to have been a Christmas present. Mr Wilkinson described Mr Starkey as a ‘smashing fella’ who will be missed. His son Todd, who lives in London, came to see him on Boxing Day without realising anything had happened, said Mr Wilkinson. South Yorkshire Police believe Mr Starkey had been ‘deliberately targeted’. Earlier this year drug addict John McWilliams, 32, was jailed for 12 months at Sheffield Crown Court for theft and assault after barging into Mr Starkey’s home, pushing him to the floor and stealing £210. Neighbours said Mr Starkey had been in the Navy at the time of Icelandic Cod Wars in the 1970s. He suffered serious leg injuries in a motorbike accident about 20 years ago which left him with a long-term disability. His family were too upset to speak last night. Neighbour Derek Wilkinson (left) says Mr Starkey was a 'smashing fellow' who 'will be missed' by friends in the street, where police have examined the scene of the crime (right) The 61-year-old died after being robbed in his home in the Lowedges area of Sheffield on Christmas Day . A spokesman South Yorkshire Police said: 'At around 10.30am on Thursday December 25, a 61-year-old man was inside his home in Reney Crescent, Lowedges, when he answered a knock at his door. 'An unknown man is reported to have entered the property, assaulting the 61-year-old and taking a PlayStation 3 and cash before fleeing the scene. 'The 61-year-old was taken to hospital to be treated for his injuries where he later died. His family have been informed and officers are providing support.' The police spokesman said a 37-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the incident and is in police custody. A second man has been arrested in connection with the death of a retired caretaker who was attacked during a robbery at his home on Christmas Day. The 37-year-old man has been released on bail pending further inquiries, but the 40-year-old second man is being questioned on suspicion of murder. Following the assault, as Mr Starkey was still fighting for his life in hospital and before an arrest was made, Detective Inspector Richard Partridge said the assault took place 'on Christmas Day in broad daylight'. He said: 'We believe that the suspect deliberately targeted this man's house, forcing his way into the property and injuring a vulnerable member of the community before stealing valuables.' The only sign of the attack at Mr Starkey’s mid-terrace home today was the fingerprinting powder left around his front door (left) by the police (right, at the scene last week) Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Vulnerable 61-year-old set upon at his front door on Christmas morning .

"Today around the world fireworks will be ringing in the new year as people celebrate the beginning of 2015. But in a week the solar system will put on a light show of its own, when a comet passes close to Earth’s orbit. In fact, comet Lovejoy will come so close that it will be visible to the naked eye - but you'll want to get a look at it soon, as it won’t return again for 8,000 years. Scroll down for video . People in the UK and elsewhere in the Northern Hemisphere will be treated to a cosmic light show early in the new year. On 7 January 2015 comet C/2014 Q2 (Lovejoy), pictured by astronomer Dieter Willasch on 28 Dec, will make its closest approach to Earth. It will be visible to observers on Earth near the constellation of Orion . The comet, formally designated C/2014 Q2 (Lovejoy), was discovered by amateur astronomer Terry Lovejoy from Queensland, Australia. On 7 January 2015 it will make its closest approach to Earth at a distance of 43.6 million miles (70.2 million km) - although it is already visible in the night sky. It will make its closest approach to the sun on 30 January at a distance of 1.29 AU (one astronomical unit - AU - is the distance from Earth to the sun) before heading back out of the solar system. The remarkable comet will pass near the constellation of Orion according to Slate's Phil Plait, which should make it fairly easy to spot in the night sky. It will then make its way past the Taurus and the Pleiades constellations. The comet's position in the sky can be tracked on various websites such as Sky and Telescope. In photos of the comet taken so far it appears green, which is due to the way its molecules react to sunlight. Astronomer Gemma Lavender from All About Space magazine explains how to spot the comet in the night sky: . 'Comet Lovejoy (C/2014 Q2) is growing in brightness and will hit a magnitude of +4.1 in the first two weeks of the new year. 'A magnitude of +4.1 is just over 100 times dimmer than the brightest star in Earth's entire night time sky (Sirius). The more positive the number, the lower the magnitude and the dimmer an object is. 'The comet is currently at a magnitude of around +5.0, meaning that it is an ideal target for those who have received a telescope or pair of binoculars for Christmas. 'The comet is much more favourable for Northern Hemisphere observers. It was a Southern Hemisphere target, but it's leaving their skies now. To observe it, late evening is best, around 10.30pm GMT. 'It's climbing higher and higher in the sky as the nights go on, so by 5 January, you should be able to see it as soon as it gets dark.' 'Even in a pair of 10x50 binoculars and under moderate suburban light pollution, comet Lovejoy appears as a faint, white smudge. If conditions are much more favourable however, you should be able to make out a bit of shape to the comet, particularly at the centre - albeit only just! 'Again, the darker the skies and the better your optical aid, the more you will see. You may even be able to pick out the stunning greenish tint of the comet, but astrophotography will make this much more apparent. 'Comet Lovejoy  is close to the southern section of the constellation Lupus (The Hare) and will begin to make its way through the constellation of Eridanus as we head into the new year. 'By 5 January, the comet will be higher in the sky and, despite a full moon in the constellation Gemini (The Twins), will be easily identifiable to the right of the brightest star in the constellation Orion, Rigel. 'Tonight, a waxing gibbous moon will make its appearance, providing a degree of interference in observing the comet. However, using a decent pair of binoculars with a magnification of at least 10x50 combined with a southern horizon that’s free of light pollution will provide an ideal opportunity to catch the comet. The comet appears green because its atoms and molecules are ionised and give off a specific wavelength of light - like a neon sign. In this instance with the comet, it is due to the molecules cyanogen and diatomic carbon, which both glow green. To the naked eye, though, the comet will appear grey; it is only cameras using a long exposure that bring out its green colouration. The comet is particularly interesting because it is a long period comet - one that originates in the most outer reaches of the solar system, the Oort cloud. Here, icy remnants of the young solar system orbit in a vast cloud, occasionally make long journeys into the inner solar system. On rare occasions these comets are visible from Earth, like Lovejoy will be, before heading back out on extremely long orbits. Video courtesy of Phil Hart . On 7 January 2015 it will make its closest approach to Earth at a distance of 43.6 million miles (70.2 million km), shown in this illustration. The comet is actually approaching from 'below' Earth's orbital plane, though, so in this 2D image it looks like it is not actually at its closest point - but it is . In photos of the comet taken so far it appears green, which is due to the way its molecules react to sunlight. To the naked eye, though, the comet will appear grey; it is only cameras using a long exposure that bring out its green colouration. It is pictured here by astronomer Paul Stewart on 27 December . This one, for instance, has an orbital period of 8,000 years - so it won’t return until about 10015 AD, if anyone is still around to see it. Its orbit takes it out to a distance of about 90 billion kilometres (56 billion miles) - more than 20 times the distance of the sun to Neptune. Its orbital period was actually originally longer, about 11,500 years, but gravitational effects from the planets have shortened its orbit. The remarkable comet will pass near the constellation of Orion, seen here, which should make it fairly easy to spot in the night sky. It will then make its way past the Taurus and the Pleiades constellations before beginning its journey back out of the solar system . The comet is seen here in a picture by astronomer Graham Bowes. The comet appears green because its atoms and molecules are ionised and give off a specific wavelength of light - like a neon sign. In this instance with the comet, it is due to the molecules cyanogen and diatomic carbon, which both glow green . The comet was first discovered by Mr Lovejoy on 17 August this year. Initially, it hadn’t been expected to get very bright but, as it approached the sun it began to brighten considerably as the sun melted its icy surface. And If the name ‘Comet Lovejoy’ rings a bell, that’s because Mr Lovejoy has discovered four similar comets before. One of the most famous was Comet C/2011 W3 (Lovejoy), which made a close approach to Earth in 2011 and was observed by many observers - even astronauts on the ISS - above Earth. ISS Commander Dan Burbank captured spectacular imagery of 2011's comet C/2011 W3 (Lovejoy) from about 240 miles (384km) above Earth’s horizon on 21 December 2011. Burbank described seeing the comet as 'the most amazing thing I have ever seen in space'","People in the UK and elsewhere in the Northern Hemisphere will be treated to a cosmic light show early in the new year .

Police in the northern New Zealand town of Kaitaia are stunned by what they have seen - going as far as posting the comment 'speechless' on social media. And animal welfare groups have also expressed their anger, amid claims it was no leisurely drive around the block. The ute is believed to have topped 100 kilometres an hour on a state highway. No, this is not a horse float. Police in the northern New Zealand town of Kaitaia are stunned by what they have seen - going as far as posting the comment 'speechless' on social media after photos showed an untethered horse riding on the back of a table-top truck . Authorities are hoping their decision to post the image on Facebook, which shows the horse standing in the back, apparently without any sort of restraint, will lead to the identity of the owner. It has also sparked much debate about road transport rules in parts of New Zealand. Houhora constable Tracee Knowler told the Northern Advocate the horse had been spotted travelling around Northland on the back of the ute quite a few times recently, and in one case a motorist had reported it topping speeds of 100kph on a local highway. Houhora Police confirming this in the statement: 'This vehicle had been seen at open road speed on State Highway One.' NZ Police say other motorists have reported seeing the table-top travel at speeds of 100kph on a highway with the untethered horse in the back . Some social media comments have taken a light-hearted look at the matter, referring to 'the tail-gate being open' or 'how much horse-power does that make it?' But most have taken a more serious tone, including local police. TVNZ quoted Houhora Police as providing this statement: 'Looking at the horse it seems relaxed - I don't think anyone would deny that'. 'However, transporting a horse in that manner on that truck with no sides to speak of, on open and at the moment extremely busy roads is just crazy and dangerous to everybody using the road including the horse. 'There is nothing to stop that horse or part of it going over the side of the truck. 'So you can say it's quiet, trained etc. - but what if the driver has to slam on the brakes or gets hit by another vehicle? 'Or as someone has said it gets spooked by something like a fire truck and siren? I too have seen other horses transported on the backs of trucks - but never have I seen one on a truck without high sides.'","Unrestrained horse rides on back of ute around New Zealand streets .

"Britain could be hit by a hike in food prices as large swathes of the world suffer from dry weather. Farmers in Russia are being crippled by severe drought, which has caused a potentially devastating drop in the country's grain production. Fears are mounting that the country, which exports the cheapest wheat, will impose an export ban, pushing up the price of food globally. Russia is forecast to produce 75million tons of grain this year – a 30 per cent drop in the country’s usual yield. Global wheat prices have already soared this summer after the worst drought in more than half a century hit Midwest America. More . than 60 per cent of the US is under moderate to exceptional drought, with some analysts saying the corn crop could be the smallest in a decade. Farmers walk in a wheat field, partially ravaged by locusts and drought, near the town of Neftekumsk in Russia . Employees operate combines to harvest wheat at a field near the village of Konstantinovskoye, Russia, last year as the country hoped to repeat its role as a leading grain exporter thanks to a good harvest . Russia last imposed a blanket ban on . grain exports two years ago, in a move designed to keep . domestic food prices under control. The . hard-line action, which resulted in a rise in bread prices, was prompted by the worst drought for the country in at least 50 . years. Jack Watts, senior analyst at HGCA . the Home-Grown Cereals Authority, said: ‘If there is a longer term . period of higher prices then this may well end up with higher food . prices.’ Speaking to Radio 4’s Farming Today programme today, he said: ‘Two years ago Russia had a blanket export ban in place very quickly. ‘In . 2012 the market is very fearful of this happening, there is no . confirmation or real denial an export ban is going to happen, but the . market is nervous based on a repeat of what we saw in 2010.’ The former Soviet Union is one of the world's biggest producers of wheat, barley and rye. Mr . Watts added: ‘With Russian being the cheapest exporter of wheat into . key regions such as North Africa and Middle East, it almost make it a . bit of a price setter. ‘So . when we come into a season like this when exports are higher likely to . be lower than where they were last season-the markets get a little bit . nervous and tend to rise. Workers tend drought-stricken crops at a farm outside Moscow in 1999 when dry, hot weather threatened Russia's harvest . ‘There . is less competition for exports from the likes of the EU and US, so the . world is essentially going to be more reliant on US wheat exports in . the coming season.’ As the worst drought in more than half a century hit Midwest America, the price of corn surged by 20 per cent in July - the biggest two-month rally since the last major drought in 1988. Lack . of rain in America's breadbasket intensified at an unprecedented rate, . driving concern food prices could soar even further if crops in the . world's key producer are decimated. Experts fear the US crisis, coupled with the problems in Russia, could cause further hikes in the price of grain. Last year, Russia exported 28million . tons of grain and the sheer volume of the country’s exports makes it a . key player on the market. But Russia's Volga Valley grain yields have already fallen by 50 per cent after a hot and dry spring. Farmers in the drought-stricken province were used to . shipping grain down the Volga River as far afield as Iran but this year's . yields have halved, sending up local prices and prompting farms to hold . onto grain in hope of further gains. With a harvest of 700,000 tonnes this year, the region will . be able to cover annual local demand of 300,000 tonnes with much less . than usual to spare, Alexandr Chepukhin, agriculture minister of the . Ulyanovsk region said. Corn plants are seen in a drought-stricken farm field near Evansville, Indiana, US . Meanwhile in the US, nearly 220 counties in a dozen states have been added to the list of natural disaster areas as cash-strapped farmers and ranchers trying to grapple with the extreme heat and dryness. The affected counties were designated primary disaster areas in the growing season, the vast majority of them mired in the drought. In August 2010 Russia imposed a ban on grain imports after a severe drought and a spate of wildfires devastated crops. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said the move was necessary to protect his country’s population against wheat shortages. The measures were designed to keep domestic food prices under control. It was prompted by the worst drought in at least 50 years with a heat wave that included the highest temperatures recorded in 130 years. This hit the grain harvest, with farmers harvesting 39.5m tons of grain - 22pc less than 2009. Analysts at the time warned a loaf of bread in Britain could rise by as much as 15p as a result. The US agriculture chief unveiled new help last week for farmers and ranchers  in counties in Arkansas, Georgia, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Mississippi, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee and Wyoming. Last week nearly half of the nation's corn crop was rated poor to very poor, according to the USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service. That is the worst rating since the drought of 1988, which cut production by 20 per cent and cost the economy tens of billions of dollars. About 37 per cent of the US soybeans were lumped into that category, while nearly three-quarters of U.S. cattle acreage were in drought-affected areas. Yesterday Shenggen Fan, director general of the International Food Policy Research Institute, an agricultural think tank warned drought in the U.S. farm belt may result in higher prices for poor people around the world. He said the global spike in food prices in 2008 showed how poor crops and tight supplies have a wide impact. The Agriculture Department was scheduled to make its first estimate of the fall harvest on Friday. Some private analysts say the corn crop could be the smallest in a decade.","Russia expected to produce 75m tons this year - 30% less grain than 2011 .

"Reverend Wayne Dulson has outraged neighbours after having bodies exhumed to make way for his new family home next to Loughton Baptist Church . A vicar has outraged neighbours after having bodies exhumed to make way for his new family home next to the church. Residents, including children, watched as bones from resting places pre-dating 1860 were dug up and transferred to coffins before being taken away. They say they are disgusted at the Reverend Wayne Dulson and Loughton Baptist Church’s lack of sensitivity over the matter and claim the move is motivated by money. The locals claim a perfectly good four-bedroom manse not far from the Essex church was sold last year for £630,000 to fund the project and the new one could be worth over £1million when complete. Underwriter Colin Hart, 50, whose family home backs on to the church, said: ‘I’m disgusted that a supposed man of the cloth should go round digging up bodies from their final place of rest. Local people have entrusted their loved ones to this church and this is how they behave.’ His wife, Julie, 48, added: ‘Whatever happened to rest in peace? We woke up to the sound of a JCB out the back and you could see them loading coffins from the back garden.’ Mother-of-four Simone Cohen, 52, said: ‘What I found most upsetting was that when they transferred the bones into coffins, the children could see everything.’ The row began after the church was given permission to develop the site. Epping Forest Council approved an extension for a playgroup at the church but turned down plans for the house because it was not in keeping with the area. This, however, was overturned on appeal to the planning inspectorate. Residents, including children, watched as bones from resting places pre-dating 1860 were dug up and transferred into coffins before being taken away . Neighbours were woken at 5am in October 2013 by the sound of workmen and a JCB which spent two weeks removing 25 bodies, including women buried with children, to make way for the nursery. An exhumation licence had been granted by the Ministry of Justice and the project was completed in spring. Work began on the house but it was suspended after more bodies were found and another licence sought. Mr Dulson, a married father, has declined to comment on the matter. But the church said in a statement it was investing £550,000 to ‘serve the community’ and was ‘saddened by any offence’ it had caused. It added: ‘We have worked with the Ministry of Justice and the local environmental health officer and followed their guidelines to the letter.’","Loughton Baptist Church is building the home for Reverend Wayne Dulson .

"Crook: Jonathan Hicks, 48, stole almost £28,000 while his 71-year-old father, Leonard, was recovering from having his leg amputated . An elderly man who spent six months in hospital after having his leg amputated was discharged to find his son had spent 50 years' worth of his life savings. Jonathan Hicks, 48, from Newquay, Cornwall, stole almost £28,000 while his Swansea-based 71-year-old father, Leonard, was recovering from losing his leg. He spent the cash on shopping sprees and a holiday to Egypt, only stopping when the cash ran out - leaving the elder Mr Hicks overdrawn for the first time in his life. A court heard the pensioner almost had a heart attack when he discovered his savings had been plundered. Hicks, who was first arrested in December 2013 but initially tried to escape justice by fleeing to Cyprus, was jailed for two years and eight months after admitting theft. It took him just six months to blow the nest egg his father had saved up over more than 50 years - taking out the cash in 177 secret withdrawals. Prosecutor Frank Phillips told the court that Mr Hicks's right leg was amputated in January 2013 and the pensioner was kept in hospital until July due to complications. His son secretly moved into his home in Swansea, South Wales, while he was in hospital, the court heard. 'The pensioner mentioned his bank card PIN number while he was quite agitated during a visit by his son,' Mr Phillips was quoted as telling the court by Wales News Service. 'Hicks then began siphoning off the cash, having located his father's bank card. 'He told his brothers he had withdrawn around £27,000 and said that the social services would take the money and sell his house to pay for care home costs.' After Mr Hicks' release from hospital, his other son Michael took him in a wheelchair to a local branch of Lloyds TSB - where he found he was £300 in the red. Mr Phillips said: 'When he was told that he was overdrawn his son Michael described him as being in a hell of a state. 'He was so upset his son thought that he was going to have a heart attack.' Police were called in to find the younger Hicks had moved back to Newquay, Cornwall. Swansea Crown Court heard he initially tried to blame his brothers and a sister for stealing the cash. But police discovered cash was spent on a holiday to Egypt - with £1,000 changed up for spending money along with car expenses. Hicks was arrested in December 2013. He was released on police bail and fled abroad to Cyprus, but was arrested again when he returned to Britain for the funeral of his step-son. Camel: Police discovered cash was spent on a holiday to Egypt - with £1,000 changed up for spending money . Andrew Evans, defending, said Hicks would 'turn back the clock' if he could. 'The defendant acknowledges that his actions between January and July 2013 were deplorable to say the least,' Mr Evans told the court. 'This was a significant gross breach of trust against a person who, he has to concede, was particularly vulnerable at the time.' Judge Keith Thomas heard Hicks had a history of dishonesty including a conviction in 2007 for money laundering and attempting to obtain money by deception. Sending Hicks to prison, the judge said: 'You plundered your father's bank account at the time when he was extremely vulnerable. 'He was in need of care rather than the dishonest actions that you indulged in.'","Pensioner almost had a heart attack when he found himself £300 in debt .

"Air New Zealand cabin crew are being praised for reviving a passenger who suffered a suspected heart attack on a domestic flight.

Fellow passenger Richard Woods said the ‘exceptional’ crew recognised the situation and jumped into action to resuscitate the man. A passenger says the man went into medical distress on the flight from Dunedin to Wellington . Mr Woods, head of emergency planning for Auckland Council, told the New Zealand Herald: ‘We were about five or ten minutes into take-off and the fella behind me was just not very well. The airline attendant picked up on that pretty quickly, she tried to get him to respond, but he wasn't responding. ‘She very, very efficiently pulled him down onto the floor and got the resuscitation pack out and brought him around with the assistance of the other two crew. ‘The crew were exceptional and everyone on the plane was extremely impressed. They pilot came down later and everyone was just saying how exceptional the crew had been. Once he'd been shocked, he came back around.’ The plane turned around and returned to Dunedin airport, where it was met by emergency services . During the emergency the twin-engine turboprop turned around and returned to Dunedin International Airport, where it was met by paramedics, who rushed the man to hospital. A St John Ambulance spokesman told the newspaper the man was taken to hospital in ‘a very serious condition’.

"A clothing firm which went from making  jackets for fishermen to become a fashion brand worn by royalty is locked in a bitter dispute with its workers. J Barbour and Sons Ltd - which makes the famous waxed jackets and Wellington boots loved by A-list celebrities - is facing strike action by more than 100 workers in the North East. The dispute is over what unions claim are forced changes to staff contracts, including the removal of the unsocial hours payment and the introduction of a requirement to work until 11pm. The Barbour jacket has become a mainstay in the wardrobes of the British establishment and is often worn by royalty including The Duchess of Cambridge and The Queen. The firm's workers are now threatening a strike . The company's clothes, as worn by Lily Allen (left) and Billie Piper (right), have gone from being a niche product for fishermen and motorcyclists to a fashion success story which has graced the world's catwalks . The company made profits of £21.5million last year from total sales of £152million around the world, as demand soared after a glittering array of celebrities and royals were spotted in the jackets. But Unite union say staff at the company have been told to sign up to a change of contract or face the sack. Its members now plan to strike on every morning from January 5 to January 30. It follows a six-day stoppage earlier this month over the dispute which centres on the firm's warehouses in Wardley, Gateshead, and involves 134 of its 600 North East workers. Unite regional officer Fazia Hussain-Brown said: 'Barbour's ""sign or be sacked"" ultimatum is bullying and anti-family. 'Many of the workers struggling to get by on less than the living wage are the sole bread-winner and have family or caring responsibilities. 'For a company that prides itself on ""family values"" to seek to railroad through cuts and unsocial changes to their contracts is hypocrisy of the highest order.' Since taking control of the firm in the 1970s, Dame Margaret Barbour has revolutionised the company's image . But as demand soars due to endorsements from celebrities inlcuding Alexa Chung (left) and Holly Willoughby (right), workers at one of the firm's factory's say they are being forced to work later shifts . The union representing workers says they are being forced to sign contracts which restrict their pay . Ms Hussain-Brown added: 'The company should not underestimate the resolve of the workforce nor the impact that four weeks of strike action will have on supplies. 'Barbour management need to live up to the company's 'family- friendly' values and negotiate a fair deal for its workforce.' Barbour has been a successful family-run company for 120 years, and its famous wax jackets are a favourite with showbusiness stars and the British Royal Family. They are sold at prestigious stores including Harrods, Harvey Nichols and John Lewis. Brenda Readman-Bell, Barbour's group finance and IT director, has said the company has 'done everything' to work with the union. The clothing, worn by Princess Diana and her son Prince William, has received three separate royal warrants . Barbour is now a major fashion brand and the company made profits of £21.5million from sales of £152million. The jacket modelled in this fashion shoot sells for nearly £400 . She said previously: 'Barbour is a North East success story – a global premium lifestyle brand sold in over 40 countries worldwide. 'Our business has grown significantly and in a very competitive retail market place, service and on time deliveries to our customers are of paramount importance.' She added: 'The introduction of shift patterns will enable us to extend the warehouse working hours in order to satisfy customer demand and to continue to deliver the high standard and quality of service that Barbour is renowned for. 'We have been in consultation with the union since May 2014 and we feel we have done everything possible to work with the union and our employees to alleviate their concerns. 'The introduction of new shift patterns includes a substantial pay increase and standard working hours on a Monday-to- Friday basis.' Barbour was founded in 1894 by Scotsman John Barbour in South Shields near Newcastle. He made waterproof, oilcloth coats which were originally popular among fishermen. The success of the coats meant that, in 1908, John's son Malcolm produced the firm's first mail order catalogue, which brought in orders from places as far-flung as Chile and Hong Kong. Barbour became J Barbour & Sons Ltd in 1912, when founder John made his sons Jack and Malcolm the Managing Directors. The company was founded by Scotsman John Barbour, who started selling jacked in South Shields in 1894 . The company has been passed down through five generations of the same family since it started in 1894 . Founder John died in 1918 and the company was passed on to Jack, who was in charge until 1927, when he resigned, handing control to Malcolm, whose son Duncan then joined the firm in 1928. Duncan was a keen motorcyclist and introduced a range for bikers, which for decades became the favourite brand of motorcycle racing teams. He was later called to serve in the Second World War and his father Malcolm, still chairman of the business, and Duncan's wife Nancy, took over the firm. In 1936, the captain of the HMS Ursula submarine, George Philips, commissioned a suit for his crew as he was unhappy with the Navy kit. The Barbour ‘Ursula’ then became standard issue in WWII. In 1957, the company built a plant in the Simonside Trading Estate on the outskirts of South Shields. Barbour moved to Simonside in the early 1980s, close to where the first factory was in South Shield . The company has insisted changes to workers' shifts are needed to keep the business competitive . Actor Steve McQueen liked the brand so much he picked up one of their motorcycling jackets on his way to international motorcycling trials in 1964. He now has a collection in his name. In the same year as the trials, Malcolm Barbour died aged 83 and his daughter-in-law Nancy became chairman. Duncan and Nancy's son John, who joined the firm in 1957, died in 1968 while managing director. His wife Margaret joined the board and became chairman five years later. She has overseen a huge expansion in demand for the company's clothes, which received their first royal warrant in 1974. It has since received two more. Margaret was made a Dame in 2001 and named Vogue's inspirational 'Wonder Women' in 2011. In 2013, she was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Institute of Directors. Dame Margaret's daughter Helen continued the family lineage to the fifth generation when she became Vice Chairman of the company in 1997. In 1981, Barbour moved to a new factory in Simonside, where many of its products are still made.","Clothing brand has gone from niche product to global fashion brand .

"Fleur Strong, director of Parents Against Child Sexual Exploitation (Pace), told MailOnline that people retreated to a 'comfort zone' of thinking grooming and abuse only happen 'elsewhere' Children are being sexually abused in every town in the country, police and experts warned today. Fleur Strong, director of Parents Against Child Sexual Exploitation (Pace), told MailOnline that people retreated to a 'comfort zone' of thinking grooming and abuse only happen 'elsewhere'. And Detective Superintendent Paul Sanford said CSE was taking place in 'all communities' across the country. In the last year police have been inundated with reports of child sexual exploitation, including historic cases and allegations of grooming and trafficking across the country. It follows high profile historical cases involving celebrities such as Jimmy Savile and revelations about sex gangs in Rotherham and Rochdale. But Ms Strong insisted it was wrong to think the crimes were only restricted to parts of the country or certain 'types' of children. 'It's a global crime so the concept of it only happening in a section of the country is wrong, it's across the whole country,' she told MailOnline. 'This type of abuse is in every town.' She said one of the problems was that parents and other adults prefer to think that child sex abuse is not the sort of thing that happens where they live. 'We are all in a much better comfort zone if we think this type of abuse happens elsewhere and its other people who are affected and it's other people doing the crime, that there is another ring going on. 'And it's something that we need to try and change.' She insisted the warning was not about 'scaremongering', adding: 'What we are trying to do is make it calmer and to say that this type of child abuse is occurring across the country.' She said she knew of serious cases involving families in Exeter, Norfolk, East Anglia, Cumbria, the Borders and Torquay. She warned that it was wrong to think only children in major cities were at risk. 'If you look at North Yorkshire, it only takes 30minutes to get into Leeds or Bradford or Sheffield. 'Almost anywhere in the country, you are within 30 or 40 minutes of a large town or city and children are trafficked. 'If we have a preconceived idea as to the sort of child that is at risk, what you are missing out on is the fact that there are other victims as well. 'They are teenagers, 13, 14, 15, 16 year-olds. These are young adults and they are different to a younger child. 'We are not talking about abuse in the home, it is outside, it can often start in schools. It is a very complex crime.' There has been a rise in reported cases of abuse following revelations about sex gangs in Rotherham and Rochdale (pictured) but Ms Strong insisted it was wrong to think the crimes were only restricted to parts of the country or certain 'types' of children . Pace said it had noticed an increase in people using so-called 'legal highs' to groom youngsters for sex and the crime was widespread across Britain. A major problem for police and social services is that where teenagers have been groomed they are not even aware that they are being abused and often believe they are in a loving relationship. This can make it difficult to persuade them to give evidence against their abusers. The police in the past have also been accused of failing to take the issue seriously and not believing some of the victims who have come forward. The Office of the Children's Commissioner has estimated that there are some 16,000 children at risk of child sexual exploitation. DS Sanford, a spokesman for the national child protection working group, said the police had made progress in improving the response to all forms of child abuse. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'Child sexual abuse has been hidden in our society for too long and, certainly in recent months, that picture has changed. 'The police is certainly now committed to doing all we can to root out child sexual exploitation and prevent more people from becoming victims. 'It is an abhorrent crime, there is absolutely no doubt about that. We are learning lessons, we have learned significant lessons from the past, but we are absolutely committed to improving the police response to these sorts of awful acts.' He added: 'The last 12 months have been shocking, in terms of the scale. What we know is the Office of the Children's Commissioner have estimated that there are some 16,000 children at risk of CSE across the country. 'That CSE takes place in all communities. There has been a model which has been frequently reported in the media over the last 12 months linked to cases such as Rotherham and Rochdale, but let's be clear: it takes place in all communities, urban, rural, small and large. 'I don't think there will be a community that could not potentially be affected by CSE. 'We are facing unprecedented demand within policing. We know that, across most forces, reports of abuse are going up by 17 per cent year on year. 'That abuse is made up of a number of things. Most recently we have seen increases in reports of historic sexual abuse in institutions and also by well-known personalities and by groups and gangs. 'There is nothing that causes me to believe that situation is going to change and we are not going to see a continuation of the level of reporting.'","Parents Against Child Sexual Exploitation insists problem is nationwide .

"A former majorette who is undergoing sex change treatment to become a man has decided to tell his story and reveal how his younger sister helped him come to terms with being trapped in a female body. Transsexual Kay Browning, 24, feared a  backlash from his family when he decided to undergo gender reassignment surgery after years of trying to live as a girl. However, it wasn't until younger sister Kelly, 19, voiced her support that Kay finally decided to go through with the operation. Kay, from Tiverton, Devon, said: 'Kelly and I are like 'his and hers' twins - she's the one person who's always accepted me as a man, without passing judgement.' Kay Browning, 24, (right) from Tiverton, Devon, says the support of younger sister Kelly, 19, (left) was vital when he decided to undergo gender reassignment after years of trying to be a girl . Kay (right)  pictured with his mother, was once a prize-winning majorette . As a child, Kay hated dolls and having to wear girly dresses, but loved helping his dad to do 'boys' jobs' such as fixing the car. 'I have four older brothers and my mum was apparently desperate for a daughter,' said Kay. 'We joke now that that wish backfired when she had me. I would chuck my Barbies under the bed unless they came with a Ken doll or a car. 'But I wasn't unhappy because, when you're a child, gender doesn't mean anything and you don't care about what's underneath your clothes.' Kay was picked on at school for his boyish looks and behaviour, only realising at age 14 that he wanted to become a boy . Kay (left) describes his relationship with his younger sister Kelly (right) as like 'his and hers twins' Kay, left, as a little girl aged four, and right, as the 24-year-old man he is today . He continued: 'When I was five, I begged my mum and dad for a little sister.  Ten months later, there she was - and I was even allowed to name her. 'I liked the name Kelly, but I called her 'Kelby' and even have the name tattooed on my arm now.' At secondary school, Kay was picked on for wearing boyish baggy clothes, tying his hair back and refusing to wear any make-up. It led to him being labelled a lesbian, which the confused teenager assumed must be true. 'Growing up, the most difficult part of my life was trying to be a girl,' he remembers. 'I was badly bullied at school - people would shout 'lesbian' and 'tranny' at me. I didn't know what I was. 'I was quite a rebel as a teenager because of that.' The only person with whom Kay could be himself was his younger sister Kelly, who accepted him as he was. Kay (right) says he could only be himself with his younger sister Kelly . Even after Kay left home, the siblings stayed close and still share secrets, support each other through difficult relationships and regularly enjoy nights out together . He continued: 'Kelly never asked questions or judged me. We were so close and when I talked to her I could forget about the names people called me. 'As she was so much younger, I protected her from what I was going through and didn't go into my concerns about my sexuality. 'We'd just spend time together as two siblings, usually watching Disney films.' Kay made the decision to start hormone treatment, which has caused hair to grow on her face . At the age of 14, a conversation with a school teacher led Kay to realise that he wasn't gay, but actually transgender - a man born in a woman's body. He said: 'I was complaining to a teacher about being called a lesbian and she said to me, ""Has it ever occurred to you that you might be heterosexual?"". 'My whole world just clicked. That's when I really knew I'd been born in the wrong body. 'By then, I knew I fancied girls but the word ""lesbian"" never really fitted. 'In that moment, I knew I wasn't a lesbian - I was a straight man in a female body.' Kay's parents accepted the revelation and allowed Kay to start living as a boy full-time. A year later he had his long red hair cut off and shaved his head. But the truth was kept from Kelly until their parents felt she was old enough to understand. At 16, Kay had his first relationship with a woman as a 'man' yet still endured taunts from cruel school bullies. When he started his degree in creative writing at the University of St Mark and St John in Plymouth, it was the first time he was able to introduce himself to people as a man. He said: 'It felt amazing to be myself among new people and not have them judge me. I was open with my new friends and explained I was transgender, which wasn't a problem for them.' Even after Kay left home, the siblings stayed close and now share secrets, support each other through difficult relationships and regularly enjoy nights out together. Kay's parents accepted the revelation and allowed Kay to start living as a boy full-time, letting him shave his head when he was 15 (pictured left) Kay said: 'If I'm having relationship problems, Kelly's the first person I turn to. 'Even though I was born in a female body, I didn't have a clue how women tick - Kelly has taught me everything I know about the opposite sex. 'I see my body as that of a man with female parts stuck on. I don't get stressed out about it but it's not something I want to look into until I'm married with children.' In April, Kay made the decision to start the physical transition to become a man and began hormone treatment, which has deepened his voice and caused hair to grow on his face. He is now awaiting a consultation about having his A-cup breasts removed, but doesn't plan to have full sex change surgery until he is much older. Reaching adulthood has not prevented Kay from experiencing prejudice and in July this year, he was left devastated after being ejected from the men's bathroom and told to use the disabled toilet in a nightclub. Kay said it is a huge comfort knowing that Kelly will always be there to support him . He said: 'I was so embarrassed. I don't know if another punter had said something, but I was in the toilets and a bouncer asked me to leave and use the disabled one instead. He made me feel like a freak. 'If someone genuinely identifies as a man, people need to treat them like a man. That's just a matter of respect. 'We are the only minority still striving for equality and there are a lot of haters out there.People still make insulting comments and say I'm 'scared to be a girl'. That's just ignorant.' But the one person he knows he can always count on for her unquestioning support is younger sister Kelly. He said: 'I know Kelly will support me through the whole thing. She has always stuck up for me and I don't know where I'd be without her.' Kelly added: 'In Kay, I have got everything I need all in one person. I have got the brother who can speak to me like a man, but I have still got a sister I have grown up with. And only I have that with her. 'Even though she's technically my big brother, I still call her my 'sister'. I think I'm the only person who gets away with referring to her as a female.' Transgender: According to the NHS, this is an umbrella term that encompasses all types of trans people, whether cross-dressers (transvestites) or those who simply feel they belong to both or neither sex. Also included are drag queens, drag kings and transsexuals. Transsexual: More specific than transgender, the term relates solely to people who, like Kay, have a strong and continual desire to live and be accepted as a member of the opposite sex. Many transsexual people have gender reassignment surgery to make their appearance consistent with their preferred gender.","As a child Kay always felt different and hated playing with girls' toys .

"It was once China's longest lake bridge, stretching for nearly two miles across the surface of Poyang Lake and providing a crucial transport link for those who lived there. As the lake level rose it disappeared into a watery grave, buried under the surface for almost 400 years, but now a prolonged drought means it emerges during the dry season. For the last two years visitors have travelled to see the Ming Dynasty creation as it appears among the mud in the Poyang basin, in Jiangxi province, south east China. Scroll down for video . Muddy waters: The bridge, which stretches for almost two miles and used to be China's longest lake bridge, was buried at the bottom of Poyang Lake as water levels rose . Antique: The granite construction was concealed beneath the waves for almost 400 years but for the last two years it has surfaced as a prolonged drought in the region causes the lake to dry up . Made from granite, measuring more than 2,500ft, and dating to 1631, the structure was known as 'thousand eye bridge' because it had 1,100 holes dotted along its length. Built during the reign of the last Ming emperor, it served as a key link between the large towns and small fishing villages that surrounded the water. The Poyang lake serves as an important part of Ming history, as that is where the first Ming emperor won victory over the Han clan in 1363, effectively beginning the dynasty. This granite bridge was one of around 1,000 such bridges built across the one lake during the end of the Ming reign. Poyang Lake is China's largest freshwater lake, and at is annual peak usually covers an area twice the size of London. Relic: The walkway was known as 'thousand eye bridge' because it used to have 1,100 holes along its length, and was completed during the rule of the last Ming emperor . Dried up: The level of Poyang Lake varies hugely depending on the season, but for the last several years it has struggled to fill itself during winter, and has all but disappeared during the dry season . Fed by the Yangtze River its size varies wildly depending on the season, but in recent years it has been struggling to fill itself during winter, and all but disappearing in summer. Water levels currently sit at 32ft (10m) and have fallen to the same level each year since 2012. Chinese authorities point to a prolonged dry spell that has affected the region, but locals also point to the creation of the massive Three Gorges Dam further up the river. The dam stores water in the winter to help keep the turbines running during the dry season, and observers are concerned this is depriving the lake of the water it needs to survive. Damaged: Chinese authorities have blamed the dried up lake on a prolonged drought, but locals point to the creation of the Three Gorges Dam along the Yangtze River, which feeds the lake, as the cause . Disappearing: During the dry season the lake level has dropped below ten metres (32ft) at its lowest point, devastating the local fishing industry (pictured, the lake at its peak) Whatever the cause, the impact on the locals has been devastating. The fishing industry has been ruined as dead fish are left washed up on the lake's banks as the waters recede. Poyang is also a major breeding site for migratory birds who arrive in the summer and rely on the lake for food while they mate. Last year authorities were forced to air-drop shrimp, maize, and small fish on to the dry lake bed in order to feed the birds.","Bridge is two miles long and once sat on surface of Poyang Lake, China .

"A man who claims to suffer from an extremely rare condition in which he was born with two penises has penned a  memoir titled Double Header . A man who claims to suffer from an extremely rare medical condition in which he was born with two penises has penned a tongue-in-cheek memoir titled Double Header. The 25-year-old anonymous author shot into the limelight in January after he uploaded pictures of his genitalia to Reddit using the username DoubleD*ckDude. Despite going public about his extra appendage the openly bisexual man - apparently blighted by a syndrome known as diphallia - refuses to reveal his identity because he says life would 'never, ever be the same.' 'The best way and easiest way to explain it is like this: If Superman revealed to the world he was Clark Kent, he would never ever be left alone,' he told Rolling Stone magazine. He continued: 'If I went public and on camera, from that moment on I'd be the guy with two dicks, not me. 'The butcher at the grocery store would know . . . I'd get asked to take them out and show them to people randomly. That's not a cool idea if you ask me.' In his new 76-page tell-all, the man talks about the highs and lows of living with diphallia. The condition - where a boy is born with two fully-functioning penises, each capable of operating independently  - affects around one in every six million boys in the U.S. Most have one genital removed at an early age, but the man behind Double Header did not. His mother had suffered two miscarriages before his birth in the summer of 1989 and was 'terrified' that surgery could result in another premature death. The man revealed on Reddit that he was glad his parents decided against intervention, adding: 'Besides the ego boost it . really makes a person feel special knowing there is likely no one else . like you alive right now.' He also said his family were  supportive during his 'hellish' teenage years, reassuring him that he was 'unique' and not a 'freak show'. The . man, believed to be American, previously revealed in an 'Ask Me Anything' thread . that he has one pair of testicles which split into two fully-formed . penises that are individually able to achieve erection and climax. The unnamed man, who now has a boyfriend after being in a bisexual polyamorous relationship with a man and woman, explained that he could urinate or ejaculate simultaneously. In his new memoir he details how having diphallia has led to a range of sexual encounters with more than 1,000 men and women. He told Rolling Stone that sometimes he likes to 'surprise' his bed partners, which doesn't always go well and women are always more judgmental than men. He claims that heterosexuals have also been curious enough to take part in encounters. He added that having an extra penis has opened him up to orgies, as he can use both at the same time, with two different lovers or the same person. When Reddit users asked him about his most memorable sexual encounter he detailed an act involving six other people - three women and three men. Posted on forum: The anonymous man spent six hours answering questions after he posted this photograph on Reddit of his penile duplication earlier this year . One of the only downsides of his condition, he said, was that it means his prostate gets full of seminal fluid that has to be released every few days. When he was younger a urologist would perform the procedure, which involves reaching inside his anus and pressing on the prostate, but he said he can clear it himself now or has his boyfriend do it. The man says that coming out about his unusual anatomy has allowed him to connect with other people feeling lonely and lost. He hopes that his new memoir - printed with the pen name Diphallic Dude - will encourage readers to embrace body acceptance. 'With so much negativity in the world, the ability to bring something positive to the table is a great feeling,' he added.","The anonymous author shot into the limelight earlier this year after he uploaded pictures of his genitalia to Reddit .

"The mother of a young woman who was stabbed to death in front of her 26 day old baby has joined forces with the parents of another victim to call for a 'stalkers list' to prevent similar murders. Pamela Dabney, 60, believes her daughter Kirsty Treloar, 20, could have been saved from the brutal hands of her former boyfriend had there been a list warning her of his violent past. Miss Treloar was stabbed 29 times after Myles Williams, 19, broke into her home in Hackney in east London on New Year's Day in 2012. Hours earlier he had sent the young mother a text promising not to hit her again. Mrs Dabney has joined forces with John Clough whose daughter Jane died in 2010 after she was stabbed 71 times by her abusive partner in Blackpool. Kirsty Treloar, 20, (left) was stabbed by her former partner Myles Williams in front of her 26-day old baby (right) and then murdered. Her mother Pamela Dabney is calling for a stalkers list so there is an accessible record of people who have a history of violence, which she believes could have saved her daughter . The pair have collected more than 100,000 signatures on an online petition calling for a stalkers register, which will be similar to the sex offenders register and allow people to look up the past of their partners if they suspect them of being violent. They refer to stalkers as 'insidious' and call on Theresa May to make the law a reality. In the description of the online petition they wrote: 'Our daughters could have been saved if their serial abusers were on a register and being managed and monitored.' Mrs Dabney, a nurse, said: 'Kirsty was terrified of Myles and I was so desperate that I asked for help from every avenue. After her death, we found out in court that Myles beat up his ex-girlfriend, smashed her doors in, kicked and threatened her, all when she was five months pregnant. 'All this came out in court but nothing was told to me the numerous times I went to the police. No one communicated with us, the police knew his record but didn't bother telling us and this is why I have set up this stalkers register. If it can save one girl's life, I will be happy.' Miss Treloar met Williams, who has two other children from previous relationships, in December 2010. Soon after, her mother noticed he was very controlling over her daughter and would even accompany her into the bathroom. When Kirsty fell pregnant in April 2011, Williams became even more possessive. Miss Treloar (left) was stabbed and killed by her violent partner Myles Williams (right) in Hackney, London . More than 100,000 people have signed the petition created by Mr Clough and Mrs Dabney calling for a register for people with a history of stalking or domestic violence, similar to that available for sex offenders . Mrs Dabney noticed bruises round her daughter's neck and went to the police when Williams would not allow her to see her daughter. She said: 'I noticed that when Myles came round I would never see Kirsty. He would lock her bedroom door from the inside and I wouldn't see them for hours, sometimes not at all. 'It got worse when Kirsty became pregnant, she started wearing a lot of makeup covering her face, looked so pale and was always exhausted. 'They left to go for a baby scan and then I didn't see or hear from Kirsty for three weeks. It was so unlike her, she was always in touch with me and her brother and sister. Then she turned up at the hospital where I worked with bruises on her neck. She wouldn't tell me what they were from but I suspected Myles so I went to the police station and told them I thought Myles was abusing Kirsty. Dean and Gemma Treloar were also stabbed when they tried to protect their sister from Williams . 'The police looked his name up and said that he was known to the police but I was too worried for Kirsty to ask anything further. 'I didn't know where he lived but I heard the police went round to his house and had a word but I still didn't hear anything from Kirsty for months after that.' When she was seven months pregnant Miss Treloar moved back in with her parents in October 2011 and gave birth two months later. Williams would regularly turn up at the house, despite being told the relationship was over. On New Year's Day he sent her a text promising not to hit her again. He wrote: 'Okay wer all gud now and my new yrs ressy is that i aint going to hit u again and i won't hit u 4 this yr next yr the yr after that the next yr after that.' It ended: 'But I wont u to swear on (their daughter's) life u wont p.ss me off and do things to make me angry love you 4 eva.' Miss Treloar responded that she did not want to see him so the next day Williams broke into her home, despite being on bail for a previous attack on her. He stabbed his former girlfriend 29 times and also attacked her brother Dean, 25 and her sister Gemma, 27, with the knife when they tried to stop him. Despite protests from her family Williams dragged Miss Treloar from the flat saying she deserved to die.  He shoved her into his car and the next day dumped her in an alleyway next to some bins. He was jailed for life for the murder and will serve a minimum of 28 years in prison. Their baby is now being cared for by Mrs Dabney, who will one day be forced to explain to the little girl that her mother was killed by her father. She added: 'Even though Kirsty was only a mum for 26 days, she was a natural. Jane Clough was also killed by an abusive partner, Jonathan Vass, and her father is calling for the register . 'She doted on that little girl and was so gentle with her. Every morning without fail, she'd get up at 6am for feeding and adored putting her in pretty little dresses. 'It's an absolute tragedy that she won't be here to bring her beautiful daughter up and I'll never forgive Myles for what he's done to this family. 'This campaign is a tribute to my daughter. I know that Kirsty would have a better chance of survival if a stalkers' register was in place. It would help a lot of men and women who suffer abuse at the hands of their partners. 'Had I known about Myles' past, I would have done more to keep him away. If I can save just one person's life because of the stalker's register I know it will all be worth it.' Mrs Dabney and Mr Clough have set up the petition called 'Create a Stalker's Register', on Change.org. The pair wrote: 'Stalking is a crime that is insidious and terrifying and yet many still do not understand it. Stalkers steal lives and take lives.' Jane Clough (left) was stabbed 71 times by Jonathan Vass (right) at Blackpool Victoria Hospital . Jane Clough was stabbed 71 times by her former partner Jonathan Vass when she turned up to work at night shift at Blackpool Victoria Hospital. As the young mother and nurse lay on the floor bleeding Vass slit her throat. The 26-year-old had chillingly foretold her death in a diary where she wrote of her fears that Vass would kill her, after subjecting her to a campaign of abuse. She reported him to the police for raping and assaulting her but Vass, a 31-year-old ambulance technician, was arrested and released on bail - giving him time to plot his revenge and attack the young nurse. She wrote repeatedly about fearing he would come and get her but it was only when she returned back to work part time in July 2010 that he was lying in wait for her and attacked her. He was sentenced to life in prison for the murder and will serve a minimum of 30 years in prison. Mr Clough and Mrs Dabney both describe people with a history of domestic violence as just as dangerous as sex offenders. They added: We need to act now to save lives by protecting women from serial stalkers and domestic violence perpetrators by introducing a register which would help police to pro-actively identify, track, monitor and manage stalkers instead of relying on a series of victims to report multiple crimes' To sign the petition visit: https://www.change.org/p/rt-hon-theresa-may-mp-create-a-stalker-s-register .","Pamela Dabney is calling for a 'stalker list' following murder of daughter .

"British commuters are subsidising foreign railways to the tune of tens of millions of pounds a year, campaigners claimed yesterday. State-owned operators in Germany, France and the Netherlands are said to transfer home their profits from UK rail services, helped by taxpayer subsidies and higher fares than in their own countries. Christian Wolmar, an industry expert, said successive UK governments had invited in ‘European wolves’ who were ‘chomping away at the carcass of our railway system’. State-owned operators in Germany, France and the Netherlands are said to transfer home their profits from UK rail services, helped by taxpayer subsidies and higher fares than in their own countries . He said Britain should instead copy the foreign firms by profiting from running trains on the Continent. ‘Why should these companies be making a profit out of our railways that is then exported to help their railways?’ he said. ‘It is clear they operate in their own national interest, and that is to be expected. British Rail in its last years was pretty efficient and pretty well run, and had a very good generation of managers. ‘If we had kept it, we would be out there chomping up bits of French or Italian or German railways, rather than the other way around.’ Germany’s Deutsche Bahn made a pre-tax profit of £697 million in 2012-13, boosted by British arm Arriva . Mr Wolmar pointed out that British commuters generally paid higher fares than counterparts in Europe, with commuters here facing an inflation-busting rise of up to 2.5 per cent from tomorrow. Some season tickets now cost more than £5,000. Some season tickets now cost more than £5,000 . Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, said: ‘Hard-pressed British commuters are subsidising the rest of Europe which has wisely decided to keep publicly owned railways. 'This is the economics of the madhouse.’ British taxpayers paid £2.5 billion in subsidies for trains operated in part or exclusively by subsidiaries of foreign state railways in 2012-13, official figures show. Germany’s public-owned Deutsche Bahn made a pre-tax profit of £697 million in 2012-13 – a figure boosted by British arm Arriva. Its franchises received £861 million in UK subsidies over the same period. Berlin’s transport ministry has stated: ‘We’re skimming profit from the entire Deutsche Bahn and ensuring that it is anchored in our budget. British commuters generally pay higher fares than in Europe, with commuters here facing an inflation-busting rise of up to 2.5 per cent from tomorrow . 'That way we can make sure it is invested in the rail network here in Germany.’ But an Arriva spokesman said: ‘No dividend has been paid by Arriva to its parent company Deutsche Bahn. 'Over that time, all profits generated by Arriva have been reinvested across the Arriva Group.’ Keolis – 70 per cent owned by French state rail firm SNCF – runs a series of franchises including London Midland, Thameslink and Great Northern. It paid £37.9 million in dividends to SNCF and its other shareholder, a Canadian pension fund, over the past two years from the profits of its UK operations. Alistair Gordon of Keolis UK said: ‘Like any private sector business part of our earnings after taxation will be returned to shareholders and a portion will be reinvested into our business to fund improvements to our services.’ Dutch state-owned transport firm Abellio runs Abellio Greater Anglia and – with controversial British outsourcing giant Serco – Merseyrail and Northern Rail. Northern Rail has been widely criticised by passengers for its unreliable service and crowded, uncomfortable and outdated trains, which Chancellor George Osborne pledged last month to replace. This franchise alone received £713million in UK subsidies and paid out £36million in dividends in 2012-13. The firm did not respond to a request for comment. A Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘Far from taking money out of the system, these companies are returning billions to the taxpayer and are investing in a host of improvements for passengers, including more seats.’","British commuters subsidising foreign railways with millions a year .

"Hospitals and GPs are to be ordered to go to war with the NHS’s worst ‘silent killer’ in a crackdown that health watchdogs say should save 12,500 lives a year. Those that fail to tackle sepsis will be financially penalised, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt revealed yesterday.

Hospitals and GPs are to be ordered to tackle sepsis, which kills 31,000 people in England a year, or face financial penalties (file picture) It is to be treated in the same way as hospital superbugs, which have been halved in the last few years. Every GP surgery in England is to be audited between now and next March on its effectiveness at diagnosing the condition with a view to making necessary improvements. Mr Hunt said that a new system for detecting sepsis in children under five is to be introduced in doctors’ practices and hospitals, before being extended to adult patients. And in hospitals, new targets will be set for diagnosis and treatment – with financial incentives for those that perform best. Public Health England will launch a public awareness campaign on the symptoms of sepsis, aimed at those most at risk. Health Education England, the body responsible for education and training in the NHS, will try to ensure healthcare workers receive better training about the condition. Sepsis is a severe form of blood poisoning which occurs when the immune system overreacts to an infection, attacking organs such as the heart, liver, kidneys and lungs. It causes fever, inflammation and blood pressure and clotting problems that can lead to multiple organ failure. Research suggests that opportunities to save lives are routinely missed because of delays in identifying the condition. The plans have been announced by health secretary Jeremy Hunt, who said that a new system for detecting sepsis in children under five is to be introduced in doctors’ practices and hospitals . Sepsis accounts for 100,000 hospital admissions each year, and costs the NHS an average of about £20,000 per patient. In England, 1,000 children under five are admitted to paediatric intensive care units annually due to severe sepsis, of whom 10 per cent will die. It has become a more common reason for hospital admission than a heart attack, and has a higher mortality rate. Failings occur mainly in the first hours after arriving at a GP surgery or hospital, when rapid diagnosis and treatment with intravenous antibiotics can be critical to the chances of survival. Julie Mellor, the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, first highlighted the problems with the early diagnosis and treatment of sepsis in a report last year featuring cases of avoidable death. ‘We warmly welcome these actions across the health system on recognising and treating sepsis, which taken together could help save up to 12,500 lives each year,’ she said. The plans were in part inspired by the case of three-year-old Sam Morrish, who died in December 2010 following delays in the diagnosis and treatment of sepsis. The ombudsman found that Sam, from Devon, would almost certainly have survived had he been given antibiotics sooner. Mr Hunt told the Daily Mail he wanted to make tackling sepsis as important to the NHS as tackling the superbugs C. difficile and MRSA. ‘There has already been good progress,’ the Health Secretary said. ‘We have virtually halved C. diff and MRSA infection rates in the last four years. ‘Sepsis kills more than 80 people in England every day. It’s time to apply the lessons we’ve already learnt on patient safety and reduce the number of lives that are needlessly lost to this silent killer.’ Sepsis is a virulent form of blood poisoning which occurs when the immune system overreacts to an infection, usually bacterial. The infection can attack organs such as the heart, kidneys, liver and lungs, causing fever, inflammation, abnormal blood clotting, shock as a result of plummeting blood pressure and, eventually, multi-organ failure. Sepsis is one of the biggest killers of hospital patients, but it is also possible to develop the condition outside hospital as a result of having a minor infection. Prompt diagnosis of sepsis is essential followed rapidly by treatment – delay is associated with greater risk of death. Intravenous antibiotics are the first line of treatment, along with oxygen, fluids and medication to increase blood pressure. The most common causes of severe sepsis are pneumonia, bowel perforation, urinary infection, and severe skin infections. Dialysis for kidney failure and breathing support for respiratory failure are necessary for the worst affected cases. Experts say sepsis is becoming more common, partly because of a rising number of elderly people with weakened immune systems or underlying diseases such as cancer.","Hospitals and GPs which fail to tackle sepsis face financial penalties .

"A former gangster has applied for a licence to hold bare-knuckle boxing bouts in his back garden. Dave Courtney, 55, has already hosted fights outside his flamboyant home in Plumstead, south east London - which has been dubbed 'Camelot Castle'. But now he wants Greenwich Council to grant him a temporary event notice for bouts on 10 January. Self-proclaimed former gangster Dave Countney wants to hold bare-knuckle boxing fights in his back garden . He says the sport (pictured in file photo taken at a campsite in Luton) is 'the most gladiatorial form of combat' Courtney has previously boasted of his links with the Krays and cultivated a reputation for using a knuckle duster when debt-collecting. His 100-capacity event is due to take place in his back garden and adjoining alleyway. The application comes after news surfaced earlier this year that organised bare knuckle fights were already taking place at the property. But his application for the latest round of boxing bouts has been objected to by a number of organisations, including the police. In a report into the application, Greenwich Police's Simon Henderson wrote : 'Mr Courtney has provided no information as to how the event is going to be run and controlled. 'Mr Courtney has failed to provide information as to how he is going to protect the safety of the guests attending or of the competitors taking part and also how he is going to prevent nuisance to his surrounding neighbours.' Sally Lang from the council's licensing department also raised a long list of concerns, from medical provision that will be provided, to lighting and the proximity of a neurological unit for head injuries. She concluded: 'Boxing is a dangerous sport and I do not consider that a residential premises is a suitable venue to hold such an event.' It is believed Mr Courtney has previously hosted fights in his garden but has now applied for a council licence . But council officers say his flamboyant home - dubbed 'Camelot Castle' - is not suitable for hosting the event . Mr Courtney has said the fights are well organised and do not cause trouble. Speaking earlier this year, he said: 'In the old days, the crowd would have been 90% villains. Tensions ran high because there was a lot of money at stake and each firm wanted to keep their rep. 'But today it’s all about the glory. Look for yourself – there’s no security, there’s no trouble here. It’s a lot more civilised.' Mr Courtney claims to have had friendships with legendary underworld figures including the Krays and Lenny McLean in a criminal career which he says saw him shot, stabbed and have his nose bitten off. In recent years he has become an author and organiser of bare knuckle fights around the country. His latest application is in the name of David Courtney OBE - standing for 'One Big Ego'. In 2011, his stepson Genson Courtney was shot dead in Greenwich following a feud with uncle David Pinto - later jailed for life over the murder. A licensing committee will discuss the boxing event on January 6.","Self-proclaimed ex-gangster has hosted fights in  back garden this year .

"When midnight strikes on New Year's Day, John Martin will be sipping champagne as he flies over the South Pole on his 996th flight on a Qantas plane. The 82-year-old from Wollongong, just south of Sydney, boarded a 12-hour Qantas 747 flight at around 6pm on December 31, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. As one of Qantas's most loyal customers, Mr Martin was invited on the privately chartered day tour with Antarctica Flights, in which four hours will be spent hovering over the vast Antarctic continent at 10,000 feet, after word spread that he'd been flying with the carrier for over 50 years. Scroll down for video . John Martin, 82, will spend his 996th flight with Qantas flying over the South Pole on New Year's Eve . 'Why would anyone want to fly an 82-year-old to the South Pole and back on New Years's Eve? But they do, so I have promised to be on my best behaviour,' he told Fairfax. After completing his 959th flight with Qantas earlier this month, he racked up three million miles with the single airline – the equivalent of flying around the world several times over. The former television news editor has completed 148 long-haul journeys to New York and 138 flights to London along the way, but he admits that he's already flown on over 1000 other commercial flights with various other carriers when Qantas' flights didn't reach a destination that appealed to him. 'Really, I'm not obsessive about Qantas,' Mr Martin said. 'I never had the aim of doing 1000 Qantas flight, just like I never said I'd live to 82. It just happened.' The retired television news editor was given the keys to Qantas' 75th Boeing 737-800, a retro-themed aircraft earlier this year . But it wasn't until the age of 32 that the former news editor flew on his first international flight. 'I made my money as a news editor, it was a good salary and a good job and I spent most of it with the tax office and Qantas, and it gave me, I think, the best life in the world. The things I've done, the places I've been, it's been wonderful,' Mr Martin told News.com.au. As a tribute to his loyalty, the airline recently presented him with the keys to its 75th Boeing 737-800, a retro-themed aircraft with a 1970s livery featuring Qantas' iconic flying kangaroo logo in November this year. Mr Martin's love for aviation and Qantas runs so deep that he often flies to a destination and back on Christmas Day because his considers airline staff his family. He also regularly flies from Sydney to Perth or Melbourne and back in one day. As one of Qantas's most loyal customers, Mr Martin was invited on the privately chartered day tour with Antarctica Flights, in which four hours will be spent hovering over the vast Antarctic continent at 10,000 feet, after word spread that he'd been flying with the carrier for over 50 years . Mr Martin never married and never had children, and he refuses to slow down even though his friends are encouraging him to take it easy as he grows older. After flying all over the world, Mr Martin can name all of the 278 different aircraft he has flown on thanks to his meticulous record-keeping. He keeps notes on every Qantas plane he has boarded and is eager to add the airline's first Airbus A380 to his list. Along the way he has racked up plenty of frequent flyer points, although he doesn't allow them to accumulate. He told news.com.au: 'I tend to use the (points) before they get too big, because if I died before I used them, it would kill me, it would be the end of the world, I mean going up to heaven with Frequent Flyer Points unused. 'The man upstairs says you can't use them for the last trip, so there's just no way.' 'I never had the aim of doing 1000 Qantas flight, just like I never said I'd live to 82.

"One of the world’s biggest banks was accused of breathtaking arrogance yesterday for handing a £367m pay bonanza to its London staff. The staggering sum is being shared out among 121 Goldman Sachs bosses and traders – at an average of £3million a head. Campaigners said the payouts were obscene and accused the Wall Street bank of ‘sneaking the details out while no one is watching’. Scroll down for video . Goldman Sachs was accused of breathtaking arrogance yesterday for handing a £367m pay bonanza to its London staff (pictured is the London headquarters) The salary packages equate to nearly £60,000 a week – more than 120 times the average wage. Deborah Hargreaves of the High Pay Centre said: ‘This is a classic case of trying to bury bad news. 'This behaviour just underlines the breathtaking arrogance of the banking industry which thinks it can get away with anything.’ John Mann, a Labour MP on the Treasury committee in the Commons, said: ‘Goldman Sachs will struggle to find a biblical justification for this greed. They obviously wanted to sneak this out when everyone was celebrating New Year’s Eve, hoping no one would notice. This just reinforces the message that the bankers that caused us so many problems are out of control and out of touch.’ The Goldman Sachs pay and bonuses, which are for 2013, were handed out just in time to beat a cap introduced by the European Union 12 months ago. And they comfortably eclipsed the £1.3million average among 13 London banks in the same year, according to research by Reuters news. The staggering sum is being shared out among 121 Goldman Sachs bosses and traders. Group vice-chairman Michael Sherwood is pictured . Star performers at Barclays in London averaged £1.6million while their counterparts at state-backed Royal Bank of Scotland were on £600,000. None of the top employees at Goldman were individually identified in the documents filed to the stock market yesterday. But they would include Michael Sherwood, who is the head of the bank’s UK operation and is thought to be Britain’s highest paid banker. He scooped around £12.8million in pay and perks for 2013. The new cap restricts banks to paying a maximum bonus of one year’s salary, rising to twice salary if shareholders approve. All the major banks have tried to sidestep these restrictions by introducing six- and seven-figure fixed allowances to bolster the basic pay packages of senior staff. This also means they can pay a bigger bonus, because it is calculated as a multiple of their basic pay – including the new allowances. European Union rules require banks to reveal how many ‘code staff’ – those who take and manage risks – they employ and how much they are paid in cash and shares each year. But while its rivals published these details months ago, Goldman – which employs around 5,500 people in London – chose to release the details just before the New Year’s Eve deadline. This week it emerged that RBS boss Ross McEwan plans to accept a £1million fixed allowance in 2015, having forfeited it this year to avoid a row over pay. Last month, Chancellor George Osborne dropped his attempt to challenge the EU cap on bonuses after it was dismissed by the legal adviser to the European Court of Justice. The Chancellor said the new rules were ‘badly designed’ and would serve only to inflate bankers’ pay. He has warned previously that a cap might have a ‘perverse effect’, saying ‘it may undermine responsibility on the banking system rather than promote it’ by increasing the size of salaries. The Bank of England also warned that the cap could have the ‘undesirable side-effect’ of limiting how much cash regulators can confiscate for wrongdoing. The Bank’s Governor Mark Carney said rules may need to be introduced that also allow bankers’ fixed pay to be clawed back if they are found guilty of misconduct. The Canadian said: ‘Standards may need to be developed to put non-bonus or fixed pay at risk.’ Goldman – the most powerful investment bank in the world – has long seen itself as a cut above its rivals and had earned the nickname Goldmine Sacks. Last month, Chancellor George Osborne dropped his attempt to challenge the EU cap on bonuses after it was dismissed by the legal adviser to the European Court of Justice . In the wake of the financial crisis, the bank’s American chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, infamously described himself as ‘doing God’s work’ and argued that banks have a vital ‘social purpose’ to create wealth and jobs. Chris Leslie, Labour Party Treasury spokesman, said: ‘Excessive bonuses aren’t just in stark contrast with the hard times for the vast majority of the rest of society – they have encouraged risky behaviour where the bankers get the rewards and the taxpayer foots the bill if everything goes wrong. 'This underlines the case for repeating the banker bonus levy that worked well in 2009 but was abandoned by George Osborne. ‘It’s clear that banking reform is unfinished business and the Government shouldn’t allow the banking sector to return to business as usual.’ Frances O’Grady, head of the TUC, said ordinary employees should be given a seat on banks’ remuneration committees to help rein in pay. She said: ‘Risk-taking banks caused the global crash, yet while pay for the many has fallen every year since 2008 top bankers are still raking it in. ‘It’s time their pay came out of the stratosphere and back to planet Earth. ‘Let us make 2015 the year in which employees get a voice on remuneration committees.’ The UK’s biggest high street lenders will start announcing their bonuses for the past year in the coming weeks. RBS made losses of £8.2billion last year but still paid out £588million in bonuses. It is expected to make its first full year profit since the financial crisis. Goldman Sachs declined to comment. The pay packages of Goldman Sachs’ top four executives show how generous the bank is with its most senior staff: . Michael Sherwood . Group vice-chairman, based in London . Pay in 2013: £12.8million . Michael Sherwood – ‘Fat Mike’ to his friends – is a leading Goldman Sachs money-maker and is thought to be Britain’s most highly paid banker.

He is a keen table tennis player and sponsors sporting charities to keep children off the streets. Lloyd Blankfein . Chief executive and chairman, based in New York . Pay in 2013: £14.7million . Lloyd Blankfein, 60, infamously declared in the heat of the financial crisis in 2009 that he was doing ‘God’s work’. But for many he has become the poster child for fat-cat pay and capitalism at its most cut-throat. The son of a truck driver from the Bronx, he was pocketing £45million a year before the crisis in 2007 – a record for any Wall Street boss. The Harvard graduate became chief executive in 2006 when his predecessor, Henry Paulson, left to become the Treasury secretary in the Bush administration. On his watch, Goldman has been accused of profiting at its clients’ expense by betting on property prices falling, while selling investments that relied on a rising market. Gary Cohn .

"Grandmother Teresa Meehan, 75, pictured with Rambo, was investigated by police for 'stealing' her own cat . When grandmother Teresa Meehan found her missing tomcat after four traumatic months of searching, she was overjoyed. But she could never have known that the return of Rambo would spark a police probe, a bitter custody battle, a mischievous poster campaign and an MP’s intervention – all over the pet that was rightfully hers. Widow Mrs Meehan, 75, had owned the two-year-old black cat since he was just five weeks old, and she was heartbroken when he disappeared in February. But just four months later, he suddenly appeared at her bungalow in Plymouth. ‘It was ironic, because I thought I’d never see Rambo again [and] I’d just been approved by an animal shelter to have another cat when he came back,’ she said. ‘When the lady from the shelter said we should see if Rambo had been living with someone else I thought nothing of it. He was in excellent condition and had clearly been looked after by someone.’ A check revealed Rambo had been microchipped by a new owner, who had renamed him Butch after finding him at Plymouth Cat Rescue centre. But he didn’t get on with her other cat, and she didn’t want him back. Relieved, Mrs Meehan thought that was the end of the matter. But a week later she received a call from the police, who told her she was being investigated for the theft of Rambo. ‘At the same time, “Free Butch” posters [were put up] around the area with photos of Rambo on them claiming he’d been stolen,’ she said. ‘They said he was being “held by a woman in Eggbuckland”, the area of Plymouth where I live, and they even offered £100 for his safe return.’ Over the next three weeks, three police officers were dispatched to investigate the custody case surrounding Rambo, and Mrs Meehan claims they contacted her ‘countless times’. Tomcat Rambo was adopted by new owners, who renamed him Butch and microchipped, after he went missing for four months . The dispute began when Rambo’s new owner – the one listed on his microchip – decided she did want him back after all. Mrs Meehan said: ‘Naturally I was extremely upset as Rambo is happy living with me.’ Distressed at the posters, which featured Plymouth Cat Rescue’s name on the top, Mrs Meehan hired a solicitor to write to the shelter and ask for their removal. She also complained to Devon and Cornwall’s police and crime commissioner, Tony Hogg. She said: ‘A few years ago I had a burglary on my home ... but the police didn’t even bother to attend. ‘I said investigating me for the theft of my own cat was a waste of time and money.’ In desperation, Mrs Meehan even asked Plymouth’s Labour MP Alison Seabeck to intervene. Mrs Seabeck said: ‘This has been a distressing case for all concerned. But I am satisfied the police have taken this case seriously ... and that Rambo is happily living with his rightful owner.’ But Mrs Meehan said she is still terrified to let Rambo out of the house, in case she loses him again. No one at Plymouth Cat Rescue was available to comment.","Teresa Meehan, 75, had owned the tomcat since he was five weeks old .

"When Labour hired one of Barack Obama's election guru's, they hoped he would bring some of the vote-winning magic which took him all the way to the White House. And in Ed Miliband's New Year message, he seems to be echoing the US President's famous 'Yes we can' slogan as he insists Labour can turn Britain around, saying: 'Can we do it? Of course we can.' On the other hand he may have taken inspiration from Bob the Builder, who famously sang: 'Can we fix it? Yes we can!' Scroll down for video . Ed Miliband uses his New Year message to insist Labour can turn Britain around, declaring: 'Of course we can' The Labour leader echoes Barack Obama's 'Yes we can' election slogan and Bob The Builder's 'Can we fix it... Yes we can' Mr Miliband used his message to strike a more upbeat tone than seen from Labour in recent months, insisting next year's general election is a 'moment of possibility'. The festive message, apparently recorded at his home, shows Mr Miliband flanked by a Christmas tree and casually dressed in shirt and navy jumper. 'We have it within our grasp not just to see out the old year but to see out the old ways of running the country,' Mr Miliband said. 'Can we do it? Of course we can.' 'Yes we can' was chanted by supporters of Mr Obama during his 2008 presidential campaign. Meanwhile the Bob the Builder theme tune, Can We Fix It, was the biggest selling single of 2000 and became Christmas number one that year. In April Labour hired David Axelrod, a former top political adviser to Bill Clinton who helped Mr Obama get into the White House and keep him there. Mr Miliband's new year message has been overshadowed by comments by Tony Blair that Labour will not will if it lurches to  the left. Mr Miliband said he stood for a 'new plan that cuts our deficit responsibly, without threatening our NHS or short changing our children and their future' In his video message Mr Miliband said: 'This is the season for new beginnings and hopes for the future,' he said. 'And Britain is ready for a new beginning. Because I don't have to tell you that all over our country today, there are people working harder and harder, but standing still: families struggling with bills that are growing faster than their wages; young people, taking on mountains of debt to get a proper education, only to find themselves with no job at the other end; and an NHS where people are waiting longer and longer to get the care they need. 'It doesn't have to be this way. As this New Year dawns, we have the chance to change direction.' Mr Miliband said he stood for a 'new plan that cuts our deficit responsibly, without threatening our NHS or short changing our children and their future'. 'This year, we have the power to bring about the change working families all over Britain need. This isn't about idle dreams or empty promises. It's about a real, concrete plan: a plan for a recovery which reaches your kitchen table.' Mr Miliband said in the run-up to the election he would be setting out ideas to raise wages, give young people more opportunities, 'set fair rules for immigration' and 'rescue our NHS'. Mr Miliband cited the Labour government's achievements in the wake of the Second World War 70 years ago as proof that progress could be made despite tough conditions. 'After the war, badly battered and deeply in debt, Britain rose again,' he said. 'We built the NHS, a modern welfare state, homes for people to live in and still dealt with our debts; we set the stage for a generation of progress for working people. 'Today's challenges are different. But if we could walk through those fires, we surely can meet the problems of our time.'","Labour leader echoes US President in festive video to mark election year .

"This behind-the-scenes look at the Royal Mint shows workers producing three new coins for 2015 to commemorate British anniversaries. A 50 pence piece - set to enter circulation around March - will mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in 1940. The new coin created by sculptor Gary Breeze depicts three fighter pilots scrambling for their Spitfires under a sky crowded with bombers. A new £2 coin will mark the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta  and a second £2 coin will celebrate the Navy’s role in the First World War. Coinage artist John Berhdahl created the special Magna Carta coins which show King John accepting the historic treaty in 1215. The other £2 coin was designed by military artist David Rowlands and shows a Royal Navy battleship which contributed to victory in WW1. The Mint, based in south Wales, said its coin making process is in three stages of making the blanks, making the dies and striking the coins. It begins when the appropriate metals are melted before being extracted as a continuous strip, then reduced to a coin's thickness. Blank discs are punched from this, and then an engraving machine cuts the design into steel - used to make the dies to strike the coins. The blank coins are then fed into a coining press with a pair of dies, which strike the blanks and turn them into 850 coins a minute. Sterling effort: Shiny new pound coins are pictured following their manufacture at the Royal Mint plant in Mid Glamorgan, south Wales . Changing shape: Metal slugs which will be melted down to make new coins at the Royal Mint plant in Wales .

Home-grown fizz has risen to 66 per cent of the UK's total wine production, which is set to be worth almost £100million next year. Many consumers now favour English and Welsh-produced sparkling wine over French champagne, and the UK now exports bubbly to more than 13 countries. The large increase in demand has resulted in a vast expansion of vineyards across the UK in the last decade, with more than 4,500 acres now available at 470 vineyards across the country. In 2004, there was just 1,879 acres available for wine production in Britain. Ridgeview Wines, based on the South Downs in Sussex, has reported its best year ever for overseas sales of its sparkling wine. It now exports to 12 different countries, which makes up 15 per cent of its sales, rising from just two per cent in 2010. The company aims to double the size of its production from 250,000 to 500,000 bottles in the next five years. Earlier this month, a bottle of Ridgeview's best Bloomsbury 2011 was served to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge during their recent tour of New York. Mardi Roberts, sales and marketing manager of Ridgeview, said: 'We're seeing exports go from strength to strength and it is our ambition to grow this to 30 per cent over the next five years as we double our current productions. 'We are selling our product to twelve countries which would have been unheard of in the English wine industry 20 years ago. 'Exporting is the best step to increase sales and most importantly, raising the profile of Ridgeview and English sparkling wine in general.' Chapel Down Winery, in Kent, has also seen strong growth internationally with global sales rising over the last five years and more than 50,000 people visiting its vineyards last year. Frazer Thompson, chief executive, said: 'Brand England' and its food and drink reputation is getting stronger. 'With our wines winning international medals and gaining recognition with leading wine critics, and our production growing rapidly, we are now in a great position to grow our exports. British-based Chapel Down Winery and Ridgeview Wines have recorded peak sales of sparkling wine this year and both firms now export to several different countries.

Ridgeview Wines, based on the South Downs in Sussex, has reported its best year ever for overseas sales of its sparkling wine (left), while Chapel Down wine (right) has seen rising global sales over the last five years . 'At Chapel Down, we have stepped up our international focus – we are exporting to a number of countries, including Hong Kong, Japan, Norway, Finland and Belgium.' The firm now plans to pump investment into expanding the winery, building a new distribution centre, improving visitor facilities and opening a new brewery. Both locations, Kent and Sussex, where some of the most famous English sparkling wine originates, are only about 150 miles north of France's Champagne region. Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss said the soaring sales figures prove that the government's long-term economic plan is helping exporters thrive . The North and South Downs benefit from the same chalky soils that are very similar to the earth used to plant grapes for famous names such as Bollinger. Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss said the soaring sales figures prove that the government's long-term economic plan is helping exporters thrive and generate jobs. She said: 'These figures are testament to the hardworking can-do attitude of our world class food and drink industry and shows the UK is a place the world comes to buy trusted, quality produce. 'There has never been a more exciting time for the English and Welsh sparkling wine industry and I look forward to seeing it go from strength to strength, taking its rightful place alongside champagne.' Increasing UK exports of sparkling wine has helped grow the Britain's Food and Drink industry, which remains the country's biggest manufacturing sector, greater than cars and aerospace combined. The food and farming sector is now worth a record £103billion to the UK economy while food and drinks exports now stand at £18.9 billion, the highest ever. Julia Trustram Eve, marketing director of English Wine Producers, said: 'It is a very exciting time for English sparkling wine, with more producers coming on to the market, more wine available to buy, year on year competition success and moving in to new export markets. 'We've every reason to raise a glass or two in celebration.'

"Convicted murderer Samuel McKinley, 53, is on-the-run from Maghaberry Prison, Northern Ireland . A manhunt was underway today after a murderer went on the run - just four days after his two sons were also jailed for life for killing a newsagent. Convicted murderer Samuel McKinley, 53, vanished from prison where he was serving a life sentence after being jailed in 1996. His disappearance comes just days after his sons Samuel, 25, and Jon, 23, were jailed for life at Winchester Crown Court. The pair were told they must serve at least 28 years for killing newsagent Choudhry Zishan, 35, who was beaten to death while on his way to work in Eastleigh, Hants. Hampshire police today said they had been notified of McKinley's escape as he lived in the area before being jailed. Inquiries are under way in the county while officers are liaising with counterparts in Northern Ireland where McKinley Senior was serving his sentence at Maghaberry Prison. He was out on a pre-release work scheme when he fled. McKinley senior lived in Southampton, Hants, when he was jailed for life in 1996 for stabbing to death a man at a flat in the city. A spokesman for the Northern Ireland Department of Justice said: 'Samuel McKinley was due to return to Maghaberry Prison by 4pm on Monday December 22 but failed to return. 'He has not been recaptured yet and is still unlawfully at large.' Samuel McKinley senior disappeared from prison just days after his sons Samuel, 25, (pictured left) and Jon, 23, (pictured right) were jailed for life at Winchester Crown Court for killing newsagent Choudhry Zishan, 35 . McKinley senior was tried at Winchester Crown Court for stabbing to death Robin Stoddart. He attacked drinking companion Mr Stoddart, 40, after a two-day binge in January 1996. Mr Stoddart bled to death after an artery in his thigh was severed. Choudhry Zishan, 35, was beaten to death by Samuel Mckinley's sons Samuel, 25, and Jon, 23 . McKinley senior told the court that he was so drunk he could not remember what had happened. His son Jon used the same defence when he and his brother, Sam, were put on trial for murder, also at Winchester Crown Court. A statement from Hampshire police today said: 'We are in touch with colleagues at the Police Service for Northern Ireland. 'We will continue to monitor this and there are a lot of enquiries in hand. 'We do not have any information to suggest this is linked to the recent conviction of McKinley's sons. 'We have taken measures to ensure appropriate people are made aware. 'Out of respect to those individuals, we will not be disclosing who they are.' McKinley senior is reported to have absconded twice before. A court in 2012 heard McKinley was assessed as dangerous and at a high risk of reoffending, but he had achieved 'enhanced prisoner status' in jail and was engaging in various probation-run courses. McKinley is described as having a fresh complexion, of heavy build, with blue eyes, black hair and is about 5ft 10ins.","Samuel McKinley, 53, vanished from Maghaberry Prison, Northern Ireland .

"Filmmaker Boris von Schoenebeck became more and more confident in the company of two cheetahs who had made a habit of climbing on his jeep while he filmed in the wilds of the Serengeti in Tanzania. But one day he got a little too close, and the young male of the pair let him him know with a gentle swipe with his right paw. Thankfully for 47-year-old German Boris, the cheetah's strike wasn't the kind it would usually reserve for prey, and when he locked his jaws on something it was his GoPro camera rather than him. A cheetah on the roof of a jeep in Serengeti, Tanzania, is captured on the roof of a vehicle by a GoPro camera . The bold cheetah stares down the barrel of filmmaker Boris von Schoenebeck's camera before taking a swipe at his camera . Boris's colleague, working for production company Earth Touch, isn't perturbed as the big cat jumps on the bonnet of their car . In the process of filming cheetahs for a documentary, a mature female and the young male had become increasingly comfortable with Von Schoenebeck and his assistant, so much so they had become regular visitors to their vehicle. 'Almost every day we would come across these two cheetahs who would climb on top of our vehicle,' he said. 'They use our vehicle as a place of higher ground.' As the weeks went on I edged further and further out of the vehicle and we actually discovered that the cheetahs weren't that interested in us. 'At one point I got a little bit close to the male on the top of the roof and he took a swipe at the GoPro, and then he proceeded to chew on it. Filmmaker and photographer Von Schoenebeck became increasingly comfortable with the pair of cheetahs who visited his car . The older female of the pair was a little more circumspect but the young male had no hesitation in jumping on the roof . Von Schoenebeck films the young male from up close before the moment he gets a little too close for comfort . Von Schoenebeck, who's spent most of his life in South Africa, said the cheetahs' presence on his vehicle eventually attracted safari guests. 'Tourists would often see us and within five minutes we would have 20 vehicles around us and we would have to stop filming - suddenly we would become the viewing point,' he said. With such interest not conducive to filming his documentary about the world's fastest land animal, he took the chance to become more familiar with the cats. One cheetah climbs onto the car via the spare tyre on the back before using the car as a vantage point to look over the grass plains . Boris got closer and closer to the cheetahs as their regular visits became more and more regular . The filmmakers became the attraction as tour guides brought safari tourists to see the cheetahs on their car . The majestic cats, the world's fastest land animal, make the most of the vehicle to get a view of their flat, expansive habitat . The visiting cheetah has had enough for the day and leaps gracefully from the roof of the vehicle . 'It was just amazing to be able to get so close to two cheetahs, and for them to be so comfortable with us,' he explains. 'Normally we're looking at them 300m away.' After the male cheetah got its nashers into his GoPro, one of many photographic devices at his disposal, Boris didn't seem too bothered. Though he did admit: 'Maybe we need a new lens.' Danger is no stranger to Von Schoenebeck, whose previous feature film Black Mamba Kiss of Death concentrated on the lives of the deadly snake that can deliver enough  neurotoxins in a single bite to kill 15 men.","Filmmaker Boris von Schoenebeck is shooting a documentary about cheetahs in Tanzania .

"Britain poured more than £1 billion of aid into countries run by the world’s most corrupt regimes in 2013 – despite warnings that much of it will go to waste. A study by the respected anti-corruption organisation Transparency International reveals that all but one of the 20 most corrupt countries receive aid from Britain. And figures reveal that British aid to these worst offenders rose by almost a quarter in 2013 compared to 2012 as ministers and officials raced to distribute cash in time to hit the Government’s controversial aid target. A study by the respected anti-corruption organisation Transparency International reveals that all but one of the 20 most corrupt countries receive aid from Britain - pictured are Somalian militia Al-Shabaab . Beneficiaries include war-torn countries such as Somalia and Sudan, where terror groups are reported to ‘tax’ aid payments, and even North Korea, where the erratic Kim Jong-un rules with an iron fist. The revelations will raise fresh concerns about David Cameron’s drive to spend 0.7 per cent of Britain’s income on aid. Tory MP Philip Davies described the spending as a ‘colossal waste of money’ and warned that voters would not understand why their money was being spent to prop up corrupt regimes. ‘It is completely unacceptable,’ he said. ‘We should not be giving money to countries who have not got their houses in order. 'This is exactly why you hear people saying that foreign aid is taking money from poor people in rich countries and giving it to rich people in poor countries – you might as well stick a Mercedes catalogue in the envelope.’ Figures reveal that British aid to these worst offenders rose by almost a quarter in 2013 compared to 2012 . Andy Silvester, campaign manager at the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Every penny of foreign aid has to be spent on those who really need it, not to line the pockets of corrupt officials in questionable regimes. It’s simply mind-boggling that we’re dishing out aid to countries like North Korea when our own finances are in such a terrible state.’ The Department for International Development last night insisted it took a zero-tolerance approach to corruption. Sources said aid programmes in countries with known corruption problems channelled money through aid agencies and charities rather than governments. A department spokesman said: ‘It is precisely because the UK does not tolerate corruption that we do not allocate funds to the governments of any of the 20 countries highlighted by Transparency International as being the world’s most corrupt. ‘Instead we use multilateral organisations like the United Nations and trusted international non-governmental organisations to assist the very poorest.’ But critics warn that much of the cash still ends up in the hands of corrupt local officials. And they point out that the aid money funds projects that should be supported by the countries themselves. Mr Davies said: ‘Even where the money is not going directly to dictators, it is still using British taxpayers’ money to cover for the fact that they are spending the country’s money on themselves – we are propping them up. ‘It is a colossal waste of money, which is being done to make lots of middle class worthy people feel better about themselves.’ The UN aid target, which has been embraced by Mr Cameron, has been ignored by most of the world’s major economies. It required a 30 per cent increase in the UK aid budget in 2013 to £11.5 billion, piling huge pressure on ministers and officials to get the money out of the door. Beneficiaries include war-torn countries such as Somalia and Sudan, where terror groups are reported to ‘tax’ aid payments, and even North Korea, where the erratic Kim Jong-un (pictured) rules with an iron fist . Aid to Somalia, ranked by Transparency International as the world’s most corrupt country, was increased by 19.5 per cent in 2013 to £107.3 million. Although the money is channelled through charities and agencies rather than the central government to sidestep corruption, several independent reports have found that many of these groups are forced to hand over large sums of cash to the terror group Al-Shabaab in return for protection. The respected Overseas Development Institute said the group had even set up an office responsible for taxing aid agencies operating in its territory. Other countries showered with cash include Yemen, home of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsular, which received a 143 per cent increase, and Libya, where the government has all but collapsed. North Korea, viewed as a pariah state by most of the world, was handed £1.3million. Most of the cash is thought to have been provided by the Foreign Office as part of its efforts at so-called ‘soft diplomacy’. Last month it emerged the aid included funding the training of 46 spin doctors employed by the state-controlled media as propagandists. Aid to Afghanistan was cut, but Britain still sent more than £200million to the country, which is rated as the world’s fourth most corrupt regime.","Britain gave £1 billion of aid to countries run by the most corrupt regimes .

"Miami businessman Gino Bertuccio is one of the world’s luckiest flyers – and one of the most thoughtful as well. The 52-year-old became the first person to fly in Etihad Airways’ £14,000 ‘penthouse in the sky’ at the weekend, and he shared the one-of-a-kind experience with friends and strangers. While flying from London's Heathrow Airport to Abu Dhabi Mr Bertuccio opened the three-room private suite to first-class passengers, who were in an adjacent cabin, and invited a traveller from economy into the exclusive cabin, which boasts the world’s first in-flight butler. Scroll down for video . Gino Bertuccio poses for a photo in The Residence before the flight departed London for Abu Dhabi . Mr Bertuccio accepts a drink from Georgina Henderson, the world's first in-flight butler . He could have spent the entire seven-hour journey alone, using the time to retreat to the bedroom for a nap in its double bed or relax in the living room while sipping on drinks and flipping through programmes on its 32in television. But he wanted to give others a look inside the ultra-luxurious cabin that costs £14,000 for a one-way flight. Before flight EY12 landed in Abu Dhabi he invited a passenger from economy, who was selected at random by the butler, to join him for breakfast. Mr Bertuccio, who owns an Italian cosmetic retailer, told MailOnline Travel: ‘I’ve been lucky enough to do this and I wanted to share it with someone. Gino Bertuccio was presented with a gift recognising him as the first person to fly in The Residence . The Residence boasts three rooms - a bedroom with a double bed, ensuite shower room and living room . ‘I think it was something cool to share it with someone who probably may never be able to do that. ‘I consider myself very lucky and I’m glad I could share it with somebody else.’ The Residence is the jewel of Etihad’s new Airbus A380 superjumbo jet, which made its inaugural commercial flight between London and Abu Dhabi on Saturday. It is the first of its kind and the only private cabin to come with a dedicated Savoy-trained butler. The Residence has a living room that boasts a 32in television, leather sofa and a chilled mini-bar . Gino Bertuccio invited a passenger from first class for dinner and a passenger from economy for breakfast . People keep stopping Mr Bertuccio to find out what it was like to be the first person to fly in The Residence, which Etihad calls the world’s most exclusive airline seat, and how he passed the time. After a limousine transfer to Heathrow and a few moments exploring the 125-square-foot suite, which includes an ensuite shower room, Mr Bertuccio opened it up to passengers from the first-class ‘apartments’, including friends and fellow aviation enthusiasts. They held a draw and the winner joined him for dinner. Gino Bertuccio poses for a photo with flight attendants after boarding Etihad's first Airbus A380 . In addition to a bedroom, The Residence boasts a private ensuite bathroom (pictured) and living room . He said: ‘It was kind of like a party. There were people coming in and out, taking pictures of The Residence and chatting and drinking. It was more like a socialising event.’ After that he had a 90-minute power nap before sitting down for breakfast. A short time later the plane landed in Abu Dhabi and the experience was over. Mr Bertuccio, who is originally from Italy, is an avid collector of airline memorabilia and has travelled on 22 inaugural and final flights in premium class cabins in the last 25 years. He said nothing compared to flying in The Residence and he doesn’t know if he will experience anything that can top it, although he hopes to one day fly in the suite on a longer route. The Residence is the first of its kind and it is the only private cabin to come with a Savoy-trained butler . Flight EY12 departs London Heathrow Airport with a full complement of nearly 500 passengers . He said: ‘This one is something different. The rooms are very comfortable even for big-sized guys like me, you can move around really easily. ‘Definitely, they are the most luxurious first-class cabins and residence cabins I have ever seen on any airline. ‘How it was designed, it feels like it’s a private jet. The Residence looks like a cruise liner cabin and nothing can compare to it. ‘I really want to thank Etihad for this memorable experience,  it’s definitely a once-in-a-lifetime experience. It was a great adventure.’","Gino Bertuccio is an aviation enthusiast who owns a cosmetic company .

"Authorities have called off a desperate search for  an Australian and two Germans climbers missing on Mount Cook are believed to have died on New Zealand's highest peak. Sydney doctor Michael Bishop, 53, and Johann Viellehner, 58, and his son Raphael, 27, were reported missing on Monday morning when concerns were raised after they failed to return from Aoraki/Mount Cook. Two helicopters were employed to search for the three experienced climbers on the 3724m summit, which they had planned to trek via the Linda Glacier route. Dr Michael Bishop, 53, is feared to have died while hiking with two Germans on New Zealand's Mount Cook . 'The situation is grim. It was hoped that if they had survived the storm they would have been spotted from the air today,' police said in a statement. 'It is still unknown what has occurred to the men, but it is believed that they have perished on the mountain.' Inclement weather hampered search efforts for the men on Tuesday and Wednesday, and approximately 30cm of snow has fallen at Plateau Hut with larger amounts settling higher up on the mountain. David McKinley, from Alpine Guide, was the last person to see the group at about 4am on Monday morning. Mr McKinley, an experienced guide, ran into the trio at Teichelmann’s Corner on Linda Glacier and spoke with them about the unusually difficult conditions expected on the peak. Dr Bishop is a Christian pastor, as well as a doctor, and planted the Ascent to Life church in Blacktown . Dr Bishop started a men's support group which used 'adventure activities' such as rock climbing, hiking, mountaineering and cross country skiing to combat loneliness and depression. 'I did make them aware the temperature was quite warm and to be aware,' he said. 'It did enter my consciousness later in the day when I didn't see them where I expected to, but it wasn't dangerous conditions for them to be out in,' he told stuff.co.uk. The guide, who was also climbing the mountain, said he talked mainly to Mr Viellehner and his son. 'It was just the type of conversation you have over a cup of coffee, but I got the impression from their preparation and gear they had some climbing experience,' he said. Dr Bishop's son, Joshua, had hoped his father, who had been thwarted in two previous attempts to reach the summit, had been sheltering from the storm in a snow cave. 'He has had many stories of being caught out on a mountain, having to build igloos or snow caves. He’s done it rough, he’s experienced gear failures and has had to make do,' Mr Bishop told The Daily Telegraph. 'We are just having faith and trusting his experience, plus the fact he is with two other guys with great experience,' he said. Dr Bishop was with Johann Viellehner, 58, and his son Raphael, 27,  on Monday morning when concerns were raised after they failed to return from Aoraki/Mount Cook . Mr Bishop said that the Ascent to Life ministry was a practical way to build self-esteem . Mr Bishop's son Joshua said he was hopeful his father was waiting out the storm in a cave . 'I spoke to him on Christmas and he said he was flying out to Mt Cook for what he said was a perfect opportunity. He told me it was a very tricky climb.' Dr Bishop is a Christian pastor, as well as a doctor, and planted the Ascent to Life church in Blacktown. He started a men's support group which used 'adventure activities' such as rock climbing, hiking, mountaineering and cross country skiing to combat loneliness and depression. In a video for the program, Dr Bishop likened troubles in life to ‘struggling up a mountain,' to 'see the summit and wanted to reach it.' He said that the ministry was a practical way to build self-esteem, to teach people that 'there's a bigger picture- reach that summit, ascend to their life and get to the top of that mountain and see the great view from the top’. The Christchurch alpine cliff rescue team has returned home and the Department Conservation rescue team is on standby at Mt Cook village. Further aerial searches will be carried out in the following days in an attempt to locate the climbers bodies, as police say the search will be re-evaluated. More than 230 people have been killed in Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park, including 28-year-old Stuart Haslett, an experienced mountaineer, who died in a climbing accident on the peak. In July, a 44-year-old Australian soldier was killed on Mt Cook after falling down a crevasse during a winter exercise. 78 people died while climbing Aoraki/Mount Cook, widely known as the spot where Sir Edmund Hillary honed his skills before teaming up with Tenzing Norgay to reach the summit of Mt Everest in 1953.","An Australian man and two Germans are feared dead after vanishing on New Zealand's Mt Cook .

"From today all companies selling digital products must navigate a hugely complicated VAT system (file picture) Thousands of ‘kitchen table’ entrepreneurs could be forced out of business by a new EU tax law, it is claimed. From today, all companies selling digital products – including e-books, music downloads and even knitting patterns – must navigate a hugely complicated VAT system. Critics say even the smallest businesses may have to hire accountants and spend hours on paperwork, forcing many to close. The new law requires firms to charge VAT based on the country where the buyer lives, rather than where the seller is based. It aims to stop multinational corporations such as Amazon undercutting rivals by setting up headquarters in low-VAT countries such as Luxembourg. But the clampdown means fledgling businesses must now record which European country each customer is from and charge their national VAT rate. They must also keep hold of customers’ home and bank addresses for ten years. Enterprise Nation, a campaign group which represents small and micro-businesses, believes around 250,000 companies will be affected by the change. And Chas Roy-Chowdhury, of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, described the administrative burden on small firms as ‘unacceptable’. ‘The Government must look at exempting the UK’s smallest businesses from this, or risk them withdrawing from trading in Europe all together,’ he said. ‘Ministers must come up with an exemption and take it to the European Commission.’ HMRC has already introduced a scheme designed to ease the strain of the new law, called the VAT Mini One Stop Shop, or VAT MOSS. It allows businesses to make a single quarterly VAT return, rather than having to register separately for VAT in each of the 28 EU member states. HMRC has already introduced a scheme designed to ease the strain of the new law, called the VAT Mini One Stop Shop (file picture) But entrepreneurs still say they are going to struggle. On a Facebook page dedicated to abolishing the new rules, photographer Martin Wilson said he will be closing the online part of his business. ‘The administration burden, risk and cost of complying far outweighs the business I do with the EU. I don’t want the hassle of being an unpaid tax collector,’ he said. Others said they were removing their own products from sale, while one businesswoman said she had spent months trying to understand the legislation. A spokesman for HMRC said they were providing help for businesses and would be monitoring the impact of the changes. Case study: Interior designer's petition over new tax legislation . Interior designer: Issy Zinaburg has spent months working on a new venture selling online courses . Interior designer Issy Zinaburg has spent months working on a new venture selling online courses. At eight months’ pregnant, the designer had hoped the downloadable guide on how to decorate your home would allow her to earn some money while on maternity leave. But now, new tax legislation introduced by the European Union could render this part of her business untenable. The law requires that all businesses – however small – must track where each customer is from and charge them their national rate of VAT. The rate varies wildly across the 28 EU member states and will require significant administrative work to maintain, she says. Mrs Zinaburg started a petition in protest which has since gathered more than 21,000 signatures. The designer says the new legislation will ‘cripple, and potentially force into closure, thousands of micro-businesses across the UK’. The 33-year-old, who lives with her husband Amir in Suffolk, said: ‘I have a traditional interior design business but I am currently pregnant and I had hoped that taking my business online would be more flexible around childcare. ‘Offering online courses would allow me to take some time off after the baby is born so that I am not working all the time. ‘I had a number of courses planned which would include PDFs, pre-recorded videos and worksheets to show people how to do their own home. But I have now had to scrap a number of products.’ Mrs Zinaburg, of the EU VAT Action group, believes that she may be able to circumvent the changes if she includes enough ‘human interaction’ in her tutorials and online courses, but says that understanding how the new rules will work has been a huge headache. She said: ‘Everyone agrees that the loopholes used by the big companies like Amazon should be closed, but the unintended consequence is the impact on small businesses. The administrative burden on micro-businesses is huge. ‘For some micro-businesses, it might be that they only need to charge £10 VAT a year, but the work involved in recording where the money is coming from and where it should go is just not worth it for them.’","All companies selling digital products must navigate new EU VAT system .

"What has two legs, two wheels, and more than 60,000 Instagram followers? TurboRoo the dog. Just five month ago, TurboRoo, a two-legged Chihuahua, was given up by his owner, who could no longer care for the disabled pup, to a veterinarian in Indianapolis. But now, the pooch is on his way to Los Angeles to receive the CW Network's 'Underdog of the Year Award,'IndyStar reports. Scroll down for video . TurboRooDesigns: TurboRoo has become the mascot and namesake of TurboRoo Designs, a small company that 3-D prints carts for disabled dogs . TurboRoo: TurboRoo, a nearly one-year-old Chihuahua who was born with no front legs, is being honored as the CW Network's 'Underdog of the Year' With the help of a 3-D printer, TurboRoo received two front wheels allowing him to stand upright and move around as if he had four legs. Since he first received his wheels, the overcoming pup has gained national fame amassing more than 60,000 Instagram followers, more than 27,000 'likes' on Facebook, he has become the mascot and namesake of TurboRoo Designs -- a small company that 3-D prints carts for disabled dogs --, and now he's receiving his first award as one of the world's most influential pups. 'I fell in love with him,' Ashley Looper, a veterinarian technician and TurboRoo's owner, told IndyStar of the pup who she took in at only four weeks old. 'I know what it takes to care for a dog as special as him because I have worked with special needs pets in the past so it was just a perfect fit and I adopted him straight away.' Fame: Since he first received his wheels, the overcoming pup has gained national fame amassing more than 60,000 Instagram followers and more than 27,000 'likes' on Facebook . The Chihuahua, born without front legs, was forced to hop around everywhere he went. Although his mother fed him his first few weeks, once the disabled pup was weaned, the other dogs wouldn't let him near any food, according to ABC. The couple that owned TurboRoo initially said they had visited several veterinarian's seeking help for the pup -- who weighed only 10 pounds at the time-- before they found Looper. They told IndyStar that several veterinarians said the pup should be euthanized, but they didn't want that to happen. Toys: In the care of Ashley Looper, a veterinarian technician, the pup received a makeshift mobility cart, made out of PVC pipe and pieces of Fisher Price toys . In the care of Looper, TurboRoo received a makeshift mobile cart made out of PVC pipe and pieces of a Fisher Price toy. This only proved to be a little effective. Soon, Mark Deadrick, president of 3DYN, saw a story online about the pup and began designing a better mobility cart for him using a 3-D printer, IndyStar reports. With that, TurboRoo was on the go, capturing more hearts than ever. He even attended a Purina pet tech conference in October where he showed off his mobility.

"Back in the days when Lysette Anthony could command £200,000 a movie, and her porcelain features granted her access to Hollywood’s A-list, she never imagined she would end up here. ‘Rough’ is the word Lysette uses to describe the pocket of North London where she now lives with her ten-year-old son Jimi. Geographically, it’s not that far from the elegant home which sold for nearly £1.7 million in the wake of the toxic break-up from Jimi’s father, Bafta-nominated composer Simon Boswell — but it may as well be on another planet. The actress — dubbed ‘The Face of the Eighties’ by David Bailey whose pictures catapulted her to fame age 16 — trembles as tells of the dramas she’s encountered since moving here in 2011. ‘My house almost burnt down when someone set fire to the roof terrace, and I’ve had obscenities painted on my door,’ says Lysette, now 51. Scroll down for video . Lysette Anthony (pictured) was a succesful Hollywood actress who never imagined she would be living in an area where abuse was hurled at her on the street and her house was almost burnt down . ‘Gangs of hoodies would congregate outside, shouting abuse and threatening to put dog mess through my letterbox, and there have been drug busts nearby. It’s been a bit hairy. ‘But even though I’m small in stature, I stood up to them and told them to take their hoods off when they talked to me. I thought, “I’m either going to be stabbed or I’m going to build a relationship” — and there’s something to be said for hugging a hoodie. ‘They are very respectful to me now, and when I walk down the street they ask, “How are you today?” ‘At first it was terrifying, but I feel safe here now. There’s a real sense of community, and what I see are young people who’ve been badly let down by society and just need a chance.’ Besides, the three-storey ‘wreck’ Lysette has transformed into a little oasis of loveliness in this yet-to-be gentrified urban desert of predominantly social housing, certainly beats being homeless — a state which Lysette claims to have had some experience. This week, the twice-divorced actress, who appeared in Woody Allen’s Husbands And Wives in 1992 and with John Travolta in Look Who’s Talking Now the following year, revealed she was left ‘homeless and on welfare’ for a while as a result of expensive divorces and the acrimonious break-up from Simon, who . The last was a particularly toxic public split, marred by bitter accusations which left both sides deeply wounded. In 2011, Simon was cleared in court of assaulting Lysette — an experience he described as a ‘Kafkaesque nightmare’ which left his ‘good reputation shredded’. Meanwhile, Lysette furiously denied Simon’s claims that she’d cheated on him with a mutual friend, denouncing the accusation ‘cowardly’ and ‘disgusting’. For months, Lysette refused to budge from the family home, while Simon was displaced from the house he owned. When it was finally sold and the assets frozen while lawyers tried to thrash out an agreement, Lysette’s purchase of a new flat fell through. For three months, she lived with Jimi in a friend’s spare room. Unable to work, she says at one point they existed on just £75 a week and owed lawyers almost £20,000. Her weight dropped to six stones. ‘It’s one thing to be broke when you only have yourself to worry about, but quite another when you have a child,’ she says. ‘It was horrendous. I think I lived on nothing but courgettes and feta cheese for three months. ‘After dinner with friends, I would clear the plates and secretly finish the left-overs in the kitchen because I was so hungry. I was too proud to ask for hand-outs.’ Today, after a year of therapy and three years of soul-searching, Lysette blames no one but herself — with the exception, perhaps, of lawyers, who she believes turned a bitter break-up into a war. She declares it a ‘bloody miracle’ that she and Simon are now on speaking terms. They both adore their son, and have put aside their differences to work together as parents for Jimi’s benefit. As the main breadwinner in her two failed marriages, she says she lost half her assets in the divorces; but as an unmarried partner, she had hardly any rights. ‘I call that whole period “Nut-gate” because it all went bonkers for a while,’ she says. It was the height of the fury and upset that goes on when people are splitting up — and it was pretty bloody.’ The twice-divorced actress, who appeared in Woody Allen’s Husbands And Wives in 1992 and with John Travolta (pictured) in Look Who’s Talking Now the following year . She concedes that Simon was the main breadwinner, who bought their home and paid most bills. Lysette says she may not have put anything financially into the property, but she still invested in the relationship. ‘The money I earned went towards us having a very nice life together. I cooked, cleaned, cared for our son who was very ill with juvenile arthritis. ‘There was a lot of hurt, a lot of anger, but since then Simon has been a model father. He has acted honourably and done more financially than any judge ever would have ordered. ‘I’m a real advocate for people getting off their butts and working, but as a mother I can’t just take off for weeks to film a series.’ On the wall of Lysette’s kitchen is pinned the famous David Bailey portrait which turned her into a star. She looks incredibly pretty, but all Lysette can see is a young woman full of insecurity. The only child of late actor Michael Anthony and his beautiful actress wife Bernadette Milnes, who died two years ago, Lysette’s parents split up when she was eight years old. She hardly saw her father after the break-up, and witnessed the descent of her adored mother into manic depression and schizophrenia. Lysette says she has been searching all her life to create the perfect family she never had. At 24, she fell in love with Dutch-born actor and arts administrator Luc Leestemaker, and they moved to the U.S. Just as Lysette’s career took off, Luc gave up his job to become a painter. They wed in 1991, but it ended when Lysette fell for married director David Price, whom she met on the set of 1995’s Dr Jekyll and Ms Hyde. Lysette remains consumed with guilt over her affair with Price, the father of two young sons. ‘I split up David’s marriage and I am so ashamed of that. I started paying his wife alimony of $5,000 a month as I felt so guilty. I should never have even started that relationship, let alone married him.’ Again, Lysette claims she was the main breadwinner — taking on awful acting jobs to maintain their lifestyle. They married in 1999, but divorced in 2003. Lysette pictured here with her former husband Simon Boswell in 2004. They have now put their differences aside and work together to look after their ten-year-old son Jimi . ‘I’ve been absolutely devastated by every single relationship in one way or another,’ she says. From now on, she is determined to break the destructive pattern. She is also branching out professionally, and has formed a production company, PerfectFeatures, with friend Rachel Chatterjee. Deals for two major dramas have already been signed. But she admits that without an inheritance from her mother, she’d be ‘stacking shelves in Tesco’. ‘It has been a fight to get back on our feet,’ says Lysette, who has a new boyfriend but will say nothing other than that he is younger than her and has ‘a proper job’. ‘I’ve not had a great time, but no one need feel sorry for me. I am happy and genuinely fulfilled.’","David Bailey's photos catapulted her to fame aged 16 .

"A man has been charged with murder for allegedly shooting two people who gave him a ride on Christmas Eve and dumping them on the side of an interstate. John Asher Farrell Villarreal, 22, was detained on Tuesday after a deputy spotted the car that police said he had stolen six days earlier in Anderson County, South Carolina, en route to the Georgia border. It appeared to be a random but deadly encounter between the hitchhiker and two strangers, the sheriff's office said. Charged: John Asher Farrell Villarreal, 22, allegedly shot his drivers and drove off with their car . The car's passenger, Mary Marie Fowler, 43, died of her wounds from the shooting. The driver, James Jerry Dobson, 44, was in critical condition on Wednesday, Sheriff John Skipper told a news conference. 'This was a totally random, as we understand it right now, individual picked up on the side of the road,' the sheriff said. 'We have no indication at this point that he was connected to our two victims.' Skipper said Farrell Villarreal asked the pair for a ride on the morning of December 24 and agreed to pay them $25 to drive him to the Georgia state line. Attack: Farrell Villarreal was en route to the Georgia border when his alleged victims offered a ride . As they headed south on Interstate 85 in South Carolina, Farrell Villarreal asked Dobson to pull over to allow him to use the bathroom, the sheriff said. He then shot both of the victims using a handgun equipped with a homemade silencer, according to Skipper. He left them on the shoulder of the highway, dumped their clothing at the next exit and cleaned up the car at a truck stop, the sheriff said. Skipper said Farrell Villarreal drove on to Georgia but later returned to South Carolina, where he was arrested on charges of murder, attempted murder, carjacking and possession of weapons during the commission of a crime.","John Asher Farrell Villarreal, 22, 'hitched a ride with a man and woman on December 24'

"An abandoned chalk mine with eerie corridors and ghostly relics has become an unusual attraction for adventurous explorers in Western Russia. These otherworldly pictures from beneath the city of Belgogrod show long passageways with pure white walls etched with bizarre patterns created by machinery and workers who are long gone. Photographer Vladimir Mulder spent three hours exploring the subterranean passages with only a single torch for a light source and found an old Soviet car during his explorations. This otherworldly picture from beneath the city of Belgogrod show long passageways with pure white walls etched with bizarre patterns . Photographer Vladimir Mulder discovered an old Soviet car during his explorations in the abandoned mine in Western Russia . Mr Mulder spent three hours exploring the eerie subterranean passageways with only a single torch for a light source . The 31-year-old decided to explore the shafts – where carved passageways can play tricks on the eyes – after hearing about the mine from a friend. When he arrived he was surprised to find that the entrance had already been pried open by previous explorers. While one would expect the decommissioned mine to be dry and stuffy, the Russian engineer said the air was wet and clean and it was easy to breathe, despite being 100ft underground. Vladimir said: ‘It felt incredible to walk around the tunnels, it was like a maze but it felt as if we were inside an ancient temple or somewhere else beyond time and space.

When the 31-year-old arrived at the mine he was surprised to find that the entrance had already been pried open by previous explorers . ‘We spent around three hours in the mines and I was fascinated with the strange markings on the walls caused by the mining equipment. ‘The mines were completely abandoned, we didn't see any equipment and the guard room looked as if it had been empty for a long time. ‘I was really surprised to see the car down there, I have no idea how it got there but judging by the license plate it had been there for many years. ‘The air was quite comfortable despite us being so deep down it felt wet but clean and it was easy to breath. ‘The only form of life we saw was a single bat, it was the only inhabitant and I'd like to think the mines now belong to it.’ Mr Mulder, an engineer, said the air in the mine was wet and clean and it was easy to breathe, despite being 100ft underground .

Farmers mix it with soil to improve pH quality, it is crushed with other materials during the production of cement, and small amounts are used in toothpaste and household cleaning solutions.

"For years the world has watched her cuddle a chimpanzee, swing on an elephant's trunk and gently stroke camels through a series of stunning photos by her mother. And although she is now aged 15 and has developed other interests, Amelia Forman, from New Jersey, insists she has no plans to stop posing with animals. 'There’s nothing stopping us,’ the 10th grader told the Daily Telegraph. ‘I’m just going to keep playing it out till the end.’ Scroll down for video . Amelia Forman  has been posing for her photographer mom, Robin Schwartz, for 12 years . Now 15, her mother, award-winning photographer, Robin Schwartz, who’s worked for the likes of National Geographic and has prints in the MoMA and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, has 12 years worth of photos of her daughter cozying up to exotic creatures . As she has grown older Amelia's affinity with animals has not dampened - as seen here as she poses with an elephant over the years . The project officially took flight in 2004, spawned by a sudden family tragedy. 'My mother and mother-in-law died quite close to each other and it knocked me for six,' said Schwartz. 'After that though, I realised that it was so important to spend time with my daughter. 'So we came to the understanding that if she was to come with me on my photographic work our deal would be that the only times I would take pictures of her would be when she was with animals. 'She loves them, she is so natural with them. 'She is a shy girl, but can have more confidence with a giraffe, or a chimpanzee than a fully grown man or woman could have with another person. 'We spend time most summers attending fairs and meeting contacts in the animal community, where Amelia can come close to elephants like Shiba, who simply picked her up with her trunk. Her adventures began at the age of three when her photographer mother Robin took her along with her as she went to work at private homes and game parks . Now 15, Amelia has started putting her own print on the photos, such as styling the costumes . The teen says she feels more comfortable around animals than she does people . 'That was a magical moment for me and Amelia. It really was like Amelia was talking to Shiba, just like you would with a person. It was beautiful.' While their adventures has already produced one book, Amelia's World, The Aperture Foundation is trying to raise funds on Kickstarter for another that encompasses the whole journey, to be called Amelia and the Animals. 'Since I was only three, it seemed sort of normal just to know monkeys and a lot of different animals,' Amelia says in the Kickstarter video, 'until I got older and I realized that wasn’t something that most kids had the opportunity to do.' Schwartz told the Telegraph that she thinks her daughter has grown alongside the portraits. The unusual photographs have been compiled into a book called Amelia and the Animals . While their adventures has already produced one book, Amelia's World, The Aperture Foundation is trying to raise funds on Kickstarter for another that encompasses the whole journey, to be called Amelia and the Animals . Amelia is totally at ease with the animals and has developed a deep affinity with them . ‘I think Amelia is very conscious of what she’s doing,’ she says. ‘In 2010 I felt her interest was waning so I asked her what she wanted, and she said more primates. 'So I networked to find her primates.’ But although she loves animals she has no plans to follow her mother's career. ‘I want to go into science,’ she told the newspaper . ‘But I don’t think the distinction between science and art is that clear cut. In maths our last project was constructions. We went to church and chose stained-glass windows to reconstruct. Our final project was drawings we had to colour and paint, but we had to figure out the proportions without using a ruler.

"The government's handling of the inquiry into historic child abuse face fresh criticism today after its second chairman who was forced to resign was made a dame. Fiona Woolf quit the probe in October after failing to declare the extent of her links to Tory peer Leon Brittan, who was allegedly handed a dossier detailing abuse. But today Lady Butler-Sloss - the first chairman to be appointed before resigning - said criticism of the honour awarded to Dame Fiona was 'very unfair' as the damehood was in recognition of her term as Lord Mayor of London. Fiona Woolf (pictured) becomes a dame two months after being forced to resign as chairman of the Government's child abuse inquiry . The decision to hand Dame Fiona a gong so soon after the abuse inquiry fiasco will be contentious with abuse survivors who campaigned to have her thrown off the committee. Critics may suspect the honour was a sop to compensate her for losing the job. Sir Bob Kerslake, head of the Civil Service, said: 'Her honour reflects what she has achieved throughout her career.' Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who exposed the Cyril Smith child sex scandal, said the damehood 'seems inappropriate', adding: 'I can think of many more worthy recipients … once again it looks like the Establishment are looking after their own.' He added: 'The public will be disappointed that people such as Fiona Woolf are receiving honours when there are people who are much more worthy of an honour, people who have done courageous things, or have achieved things for their country. 'I'm sure her achievements warrant an honour but the timing is a bit off. I suspect some people might be upset and it might have been more appropriate to let a bit of time elapse.' However, Lady Butler-Sloss today leapt to her defence, blaming the Home Office for failing to perform proper checks on Dame Fiona's links to former home secretary Lord Brittan. Lady Butler-Sloss, who stood down from her role on the troubled inquiry in July because her brother, Sir Michael Havers, was attorney general in the 1980s, was speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme in her role as guest editor. Defending the decision to award the honour, she said: 'She was Lord Mayor of London, she is only the second woman ever to be Lord Mayor of London. 'The very least that the honours system could do would be to honour a woman who has got such a distinguished post. 'Unfortunately she had, like myself, a brief period where she had agreed - for goodness sake, she had agreed to do a very disagreeable job to become chairman. 'And because she happened to know Leon Brittan, she was unacceptable to the survivors and therefore she stood down.' Lady Butler-Sloss today leapt to Dame Fiona's defence, blaming the Home Office for failing to perform proper checks on Dame Fiona's links to former home secretary Lord Brittan . She criticised officials for failing to spot the potential difficulties the contacts with Lord Brittan could cause. 'I don't know what happened. There was discussion between her and, presumably, the Home Office. 'I think they made a mistake in not doing sufficient due diligence, actually. 'But the fact is she is a very distinguished woman, she did a wonderful year's job as Lord Mayor and of course she gets an honour for it, that's why she gets it. After Dame Fiona was appointed to the role, it emerged she had close links to Lord Brittan, who is likely to be called to give evidence to the inquiry . 'To put if off to another time would be a reflection on the City of London.' Edinburgh-born Woolf, a City of London lawyer already honoured with a CBE in 2001, was made a Dame for services to the legal profession, diversity and the City of London in the New Year Honours. But Simon Danczuk, Labour MP for Rochdale and a leading figure campaigning against child abuse cover-ups, was scathing about the honour. He said: 'Fiona Woolf misled the Home Secretary over her links with Leon Brittan, caused unnecessary distress to victims of child abuse and caused a lengthy and avoidable delay to a very serious inquiry that urgently needs to get started. 'It seems inappropriate that she's now being invited to Buckingham Palace to pick up one of the highest honours. 'I can think of many more worthy recipients of this honour, but once again it looks like the Establishment is looking after their own.' Dame Fiona's links to Lord Brittan prompted the calls for her resignation. Lord Brittan is likely to be called to give evidence to the inquiry over a dossier he received from MP Geoffrey Dickens in 1983, documenting the alleged involvement of VIP figures in a child sex ring.

Bishop Declan Lang, chairman of the Bishops' Conference Department of International Affairs, told The Tablet: 'The publication of this atlas will confirm Israel's belief that there exists a hostility towards their country from parts of the Arab world.

But the decision to omit Israel on the map has sparked anger on social media, with some Twitter users calling for the boycott of HarperCollins. Dr Jane Clements, director of the Council of Christians and Jews, told The Tablet: 'Maps can be a very powerful tool in terms of de-legitimising ""the other"" and can lead to confusion rather than clarity.

"Police came under fire last night for responding to an insulting tweet from provocative TV personality Katie Hopkins about Pauline Cafferkey. They said they were investigating posts by the former Apprentice contestant which called the nurse a ‘sweaty Glaswegian’ and referred to Scots as ‘Jocks’. Police Scotland confirmed they were looking into complaints about the tweets, which numbered in the ‘hundreds’. Scroll down for video . Investigation: Police are probing tweets sent by Katie Hopkins (left) after the Scottish nurse with Ebola, Pauline Cafferkey, was flown from Glasgow (right) to London for specialist care . However, critics including Ukip leader Nigel Farage last night branded the investigation a ‘waste of police time’. Detective Inspector Glyn Roberts, of Police Scotland, said: ‘We have received a number of complaints regarding remarks made on Twitter. ‘Inquiries are ongoing into the nature of these tweets and to establish any potential criminality. Police Scotland will thoroughly investigate any reports of offensive or criminal behaviour online and anyone found to be responsible will be robustly dealt with.’ Offensive: This week Hopkins called the Scottish 'sweaty little jocks, which has caused uproar . Television personality Katie Hopkins provoked outrage after she made jibes about Scottish independence after she learnt that a patient with Ebola had been moved from Glasgow to London for treatment . Outrage: More than 12,000 people have signed a petition demanding Katie Hopkins is arrested . As Miss Cafferkey was being transferred from her home to a hospital in London, Hopkins took the opportunity to poke fun at those who support Scottish independence. She wrote: ‘Glaswegian ebola patient moved to London’s Royal Free Hospital. Not so independent when it matters most are we jocksville?’ She added: ‘Little sweaty jocks, sending us Ebola bombs in the form of sweaty Glaswegians just isn’t cricket.’ Her remarks caused outrage on Twitter, with many accusing her of racism, while journalist Piers Morgan branded her a ‘repulsive creature’. Last night an online petition to see her charged by police had been backed by more than 17,500 people. Katie Hopkins has been accused of committing a hate crime against fat people. The TV star was reported to police by plus size campaigner Kathryn Szrodecki (right) during filming for Katie's new documentary. But the decision of Police Scotland to step in has raised concern that officers should be dealing with genuine crime rather than Twitter spats. Last night, Mr Farage said: ‘There’s no need for police intervention, it’s a terrible waste of police time. ‘If [Katie Hopkins] wants to behave like that then the public can judge her. There will always be people who will be rude about others, but it’s not a police matter.’ Andy Silvester, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Miss Hopkins’ tweet was insensitive, tasteless and not particularly amusing, but for a whole number of reasons it’s not the sort of thing the police should be dealing with. ‘We’re embarking on an extraordinarily dangerous and slippery slope if we start investigating people for being “offensive”.’ Police forces have reported a massive rise in social media-related complaints, with many struggling to cope with the extra workload. In cockney rhyming slang, 'Sweaty Sock' means Jock - a Scotsman. Jock is a slightly pejorative term meaning a Scottish person. The term has led to the abbreviated derogatory term 'Sweaties'. In 2011 Mark Lynch, originally from Glasgow, said he was called 'sweaty sock, Scottish b*****d, Jock and Scottie' at the Cornish abbatoir where he worked  and sued his employer for racial discrimination. He lost the racism claim at an employment tribunal. Almost 20,000 adults were investigated in the past three years for online comments, the equivalent of almost 20 each day, according to figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. In addition more than 2,000 children – some as young as nine – have been investigated for social media messages. In light of the rising number of complaints, the Crown Prosecution Service issued new guidance last year in an attempt to clarify the law on criminal online postings. Prosecutors were advised to look out for messages that constituted a ‘credible threat of violence to the person or damage to property’. In 2010, Paul Chambers was investigated and charged for a tweet in which he joked that he would blow Robin Hood airport ‘sky high’. He was convicted, but the conviction was quashed in 2012, after a judge deemed that his message was not intended to be menacing. Miss Hopkins has herself complained of threats of rape and violence online. The Sun newspaper columnist, who has deliberately courted controversy with attacks on the parents of Madeleine McCann, once said: ‘Being threatened with rape and violence are nothing new to me on Twitter. I have been choosing to ignore trolls for months. ‘They threaten me, my children and my home. I certainly don’t think it is a problem for the police.’","Katie Hopkins caused offence with comments about Scottish Ebola nurse .

"Two Boston police officers were hospitalized after they were allegedly attacked by seven teenagers, all family members, in a Roxbury apartment complex when the officers tried to arrest one of them, authorities said Tuesday. Boston Police Commissioner William Evans said the officers, a woman and a man, were 'badly roughed up' in Monday's attack but were recovering. Both have since been released from the hospital. Their names have not been made public. Arrested: 19-year-old Woobenson Morisset (left) and his 18-year-old brother Lorcen Morisset (right), along with five others were arrested Monday after allegedly roughing up two cops . Arrest: The officers were allegedly attacked when they went to the apartment at 6 Wayne street on Monday morning and tried to arrest 19-year-old Woobenson Morisset on violating the terms of his release . Evans said he expects the two officers will be off work for some time. Mayor Martin Walsh said he does not believe the assault has anything to do with rising national tensions over police conduct following the killings of unarmed men in Missouri and New York City. The police commissioner agreed but added: 'It's troubling to me that all this animosity is geared toward our department because we work our hardest every day to make sure the streets of Boston are as safe as possible.' Evans said the officers were attacked when they went to the apartment at 6 Wayne street on Monday morning and tried to arrest 19-year-old Woobenson Morisset on violating the terms of his release in three pending cases. One case included a charge of assault and battery of a police officer. The Suffolk County prosecutor said Morisset is accused of punching an officer in December 2013 who was trying to arrest him for an attempted home break-in. Evans said Morisset, his 18-year-old brother Lorcen Morisset, and five others were arrested Monday. Violating terms of arrest: Woobenson Morisset and his other teenage family members allegedly roughed up two cops on Monday following an arrest . According to a police report, Morisset engaged in a 'violent fight' with officers before his family members got involved. The officers were 'kicked, punched and choked by numerous suspects.' Evans said the officers used pepper spray to fight off their attackers until other officers arrived, but they never drew their guns. The Morisset brothers pleaded not guilty Tuesday to two misdemeanor counts each of assault and battery on a police officer. The older brother was released on $500 bail; Lorcen Morisset was released on his own recognizance. Prosecutors say they will seek additional charges of felony assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. Before the arraignment, Lorcen Morisset told news reporters that the group didn't attack the two officers. 'That's a lie. We didn't touch them,' he said outside court. In custody: Lorcen Morisset (pictured left and right) was arrested on Monday after allegedly roughing up a cop along with his five other relatives . He said police began to beat Woobenson Morisset after the brothers asked the officers to produce the arrest warrant. He said he recorded the confrontation on his cellphone, which police seized. He said four of the teenagers hid in an apartment and were not involved in the confrontation. Asked about Lorcen Morisset's allegations, Suffolk County District Attorney spokesman Jake Wark said in an email: ""With regard to those claims, the fact that seven co-defendants were sent to court while two police officers were sent to the hospital speaks for itself."" The other teenagers - a 17-year-old boy and four girls, ages 13, 14, 15, and 16 - pleaded not guilty to assault and battery on a police officer, resisting arrest, and other delinquency charges in juvenile court Tuesday. A judge set bail at $500 for the 17-year-old and $1 for the other juveniles, with that amount to be posted only by their parents. The next court date for the five teens is February 12. The Morisset brothers are due in court March 12.","Boston Police Commissioner William Evans said the officers, a woman and a man, were 'badly roughed up' in Monday's attack .

"A German photographer exasperated by the inequalities of the American penal system became fascinated by a late night bus that transports the families of inmates to remote prison facilities to visit their loved ones for just a few hours. 'I was struck by the fact I have lived in the city for 10 years and yet I’d never seen a bus or heard about them,' said photographer Jacobia Dahm who is responsible for the moving series called 'In Transit.' Since November, Dahm has been posting pics from her series to her Instagram account. Now the photos and a short film can be viewed on her website. Seeing dad: Charles, 8, and Raul, 3, traveling to see their dad in Attica Correctional Facility, 350 miles northwest of New York City . Separated: Candis is holding one of the precious prison polaroids, the only pictures people have of their loved ones on the inside, of her with her husband  John and her daughter Camryn . Dahm, a mother of two,  learned that mostly wives and children of inmates ride the bus and she became determined to capture that in a portrait. 'I thought, ‘I have to find that image,' she said. From February to May, Dahm took six trips on the prison bus and paid $65 per trip and travels to six different prisons. According to the artist's website, 2.7 million American children have a parent in prison and more than 80,000 people are incarcerated in New York State. 'This journey sets out from the bustling hubs of New York yet it is invisible to most outsiders. The overnight bus ride to the different prisons hundreds of miles north of the city is a long and difficult one marked by anxiety, sadness, and exhaustion,' she said. Lined up: Family members board the bus to see their inmate relatives hundreds of miles away . Destination: Attica is a maximum security prison located in upstate New York and one of the bus stops . The farthest is 20 miles from the Canadian border and 300 miles from New York City. The trip can last as long as 24 hours and space is very limited. Some passengers choose to book their ticket on Monday morning to leave on Friday and Saturday nights from Manhattan, Brooklyn, and the Bronx. 'The bus is almost like a secondary imprisonment,' Dahm told The New York Times. 'You won’t be riding it forever, but you will be for a long time,' she added. A large portion of the passengers are children for whom a ticket costs $30. The bus is privately owned and operated by the driver. The city once offered a shuttle for prison visitors but the practice stopped in 2011. 'Prisons could care less how people get up there,' said Dahm. Arrived: After an 8-10 hour bus ride people get dropped off at the visitor center of the prison and usually wait an hour or two of time before the actual visit . Overnight ride: Camryn, 1, after boarding the bus in Brooklyn made the overnight trip with her mother to see her father in Wyoming Correctional Facility . Families of the prisoners take the long journey because they must in order to be reconnected with loved ones. Despite the cold nature of the bus and the strict guidelines from prisons, visitors celebrate being able to see their missed family members. 'Even after all the unpleasant things they had to go through, there was a celebratory sense on the bus,' she said. 'It’s amazing to see people trying to keep family life and intimacy going against all odds,' she added. 'At least half the people they visit are in prison for a ridiculous amount of time,' she said. 'No one is being helped, and a lot of people are being hurt.' Dahm herself is a mother of two and felt especially for the children forced to take the journey. 'The first or second time, it is difficult for them, ‘she said. 'After that, it becomes a routine. They know they are going to see Dad or Mom. This is just what you have to do to get there,' she concluded. Seeing his mother: Jeremiah, 2, asleep as the bus is passing Attica prison in the early morning hours on his way to see his mother at Albion Correctional Facility .

"New Year’s Eve partygoers in Britain were today told to expect a dry evening with temperatures up to double figures as they welcome in 2015. The mild forecast  - with 10C (50F) expected in Plymouth - was issued as the country prepared to bid farewell to one of the warmest years on record. People watching fireworks in London will enjoy a dry but breezy and cloudy evening with the Met Office forecasting a temperature of 6C (43F). Western parts of the country should expect rain in the evening, although this is likely to become lighter as midnight approaches.

Edinburgh is likely to be cloudy but dry for its Hogmanay celebrations, with a chance of the odd wintry shower early on in the evening. The evening should be mild in the city, with minimum temperatures at 9C (48F) or 10C (50F) at midnight. Dublin will be milder still, at a likely 11C (52F). The Irish capital is also likely to experience showers early on but should be dry in the run up to midnight. The mean average daily maximum temperature for 1981-2010 in Britain according to the Met Office is about 9C for March. Meanwhile, the Met Office has issued a yellow 'be aware' severe weather warning for wind tomorrow for the west coast of England and Wales.

Treacherous road conditions in the cold weather have cost at least six lives since Boxing Day, with the latest two on Monday in Somerset and Sussex. And according to the Met Office the last few days have seen some of the coldest temperatures of the year so far. Cromdale in Moray, Scotland, saw -9C (15.8F) in the early hours of December 27, the coldest the country has seen this year. This was reflected in the rest of the UK with England, Wales and Northern Ireland having their lowest temperatures of 2014 so far the following night. This is despite experts suggesting this year could be the UK’s warmest, as measured by the world’s oldest temperature record over almost 250 years.

The 11 months from January to November have already been the warmest period on the Met Office’s Central England Temperature record. A spokesman for MeteoGroup said: ‘It will be a good evening to be out as it is mostly dry over much of England. ‘The North and West might see some patchy rain, as will Scotland, but it won’t be a bad night for being outside anywhere.’ The Met Office warned conditions are set to change from the current crisp winter days, with a rise in temperatures and more unsettled, windy weather. Through New Year’s Day, it will gradually turn wet and windy across the whole of the country - but it should stay mild tomorrow and on Friday. However, from Saturday temperatures will be falling back to those more commonly seen earlier this week - with 6C (43F) expected in central London. Today at 7am there was a huge contrast in temperatures across England, with -6C (21F) in south Oxfordshire and 10C in west Cornwall. Yesterday's warmest place was Achnagart in the Highlands at 10.6C (51.1F) - while Bude in Cornwall saw the most sunshine, of seven hours. ++ 2014 RECORDS ++ HOTTEST TEMPERATURE: 32.3C IN GRAVESEND (JULY) ++ COLDEST: -9C IN CROMDALE, MORAY (DECEMBER) ++ HIGHEST WIND: 109MPH ON NEEDLES, ISLE OF WIGHT (FEBRUARY) ++ WETTEST DAY: 5.8IN IN ENNERDALE, CUMBRIA (MARCH) ++ . Global warming has ‘substantially increased’ the chance of temperature records being broken in the UK, with 2014 set to be the country's hottest year on record, weather experts have said. The UK's average temperature is expected to be 9.9C (49.8F) this year - the warmest in records dating back to 1910 and beating the previous highest of 9.7C (49.5F) set in 2006, according to the Met Office. It means that the UK's top eight warmest years have been recorded since 2002. 2014 is also set to be the hottest on record in the Central England Temperature (CET) series, which has recorded temperatures in an area of England since 1659 and is the longest-running record of instrumental temperature measurements in the world. The average temperature is expected to be 11C (51.8F), which would beat the previous record of 10.9C (51.6F) set in 2006.The Met Office said that while there had been no ‘record-breaking’ individual months for temperatures, every month, except August, had been warmer than average. A spokesman said: ‘Although individual months were unremarkable, it was the persistence of the warmth that was unusual and together they add up to something record-breaking. 'Human influence on the climate is likely to have substantially increased the chance of breaking the UK and CET temperature records. Estimates from the Met Office suggest that it has become about 10 times more likely for the UK record to be broken as a result of human influence on the climate.’ The Met Office used temperature figures from January to December 28, and assumed average weather conditions for the final three days of the year. It has also been notably wet in 2014, after the UK recorded its fifth wettest year since records dating back to 1910. Some 1290mm (50.8in) of rain fell up to December 28 - just 5mm (0.2in) short of the fourth wettest year in 2008 but with three days of the year remaining. The Met Office said the winter of 2013/2014 was the UK's wettest in records since 1910, and in the long-running England and Wales precipitation series from 1766. May, August, October and November were also wetter than average, while August was especially wet in northern Scotland. The remaining months were mostly drier than average, with September the driest on record since 1910 with just 22.1mm (0.87in) of rain. Gravesend in Kent recorded the UK's highest temperature of the year after the mercury soared to 32.3C (90.1F) on July 18. Cromdale, in Moray, Scotland saw the lowest temperature of -9C (15.8F) on December 27. However the Met Office said this was ‘unusually mild’ as temperatures usually fall below -10 B0C (14F) and often -15 B0C (5F). The highest wind of 109mph was recorded at the Needles, Old Battery, on the Isle of Wight, on February 14. Meanwhile, Ennerdale in Cumbria saw the UK's wettest day in 2014 after 146.8mm (5.78in) of rain fell on March 6.","Forecast for tonight issued as UK prepares to say goodbye to one of warmest years on record .

"Professor Rosemarie Morgan, of Yale University, has joined the campaign to oppose a housing development in a Dorset hamlet where Thomas Hardy was inspired to pen his famous works . The fight to save a village where Thomas Hardy was inspired to write some of his most famous works has stretched across the world, to America. Yale University has now joined the campaign to protect the village of Lower Bockhampton in Dorset  after campaigners, including Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes, said it would be 'obliterated' if a new housing development were to go ahead. An application by an agricultural college to build 70 homes at the tiny village where Hardy went to school has been fiercely opposed by fans of the writer who said the extra houses would triple the size of the hamlet and ruin its tranquil setting. Now 3,000 miles away, Professor Rosemarie Morgan, has launched an official objection to the development. Hardy went to school in Lower Bockhampton, near Dorchester, and penned Far From the Madding Crowd at his parents' cottage nearby. The village, which has just 28 houses, also provided the inspiration for two of his greatest works; 'Under the Greenwood Tree' and 'Tess of the D'urbervilles.' As well as Lord Fellowes and Yale, The National Trust, English Heritage, the Campaign to Protect Rural England, the Ramblers' Association the Open Spaces Society and a member of the public called Shakespeare are fighting the plans. Prof Morgan, who has taught at Yale for 20 years and is the president of the Thomas Hardy Association, said: 'The size, scale and intrusive nature of the proposed development would adversely affect the serene, rustic character of the high value landscape. 'Such heritage assets once destroyed would be destroyed forever. 'The setting of the hamlet, to which thousands of visitors are drawn every year - many in homage to Thomas Hardy's country - would cease to be a global attraction; indeed its loss would be mourned by millions.' Hardy was born in Higher Bockhampton  in 1840 and grew up in his parents' thatched cottage. He  walked a mile every day to go to school at Lower Bockhampton, which the author called Melstock, and has just 28 properties. In 'Under the Greenwood Tree', the new school mistress, Fancy Day, arrives in 'Melstock' and attracts a number of suiters to the school house where she lives, including the local vicar. The old school house is now a private residence but the original bell that would have signaled to Hardy the start of the school day remains in the porch. Hardy walked to Lower Bockhampton in Dorset every day, taking inspiration to write Tess of the D'ubervilles . Lower Bockhampton is also the place where Hardy first encountered an 18-year-old milkmaid who he based the main character in 'Tess of the D'urbervilles' on. Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes lives in the neighbouring village of West Stafford and is president of the Hardy society. He said the development would be like an 'atomic bomb' for residents and the countryside and rolling hills needed to be preserved as they were key to Hardy's inspiration. He said: 'Following the examples of Haworth or Chawton where students of the Brontes or Austen may still see and understand the places that inspired their work. Julian Fellowes, pictured on a bridge in the hamlet, said he believes it will be obliterated by the development . Hardy was inspired by the sights, buildings and people he saw in Lower Bockhampton to pen his novels . Campaigners have opposed the planning application since it was submitted by an agricultural college . 'The truth is that Dorset, unlike most counties, boasts a writer of global significance in Hardy and it is our responsibility to protect and preserve the environment that gave birth to his works for students all over the planet to come and see for themselves.' He added: 'It would be quite impossible to drop seventy houses on to this little community without destroying it utterly.' Kingston Maurward agricultural college, which owns two parcels of land either side of Lower Bockhampton, submitted the planning application. It said developing the land is the only way they can raise funds to expand and develop. The plans involve building 70 properties on land between Lower Bockhampton and Higher Bockhampton . Kingston Maurward agricultural college said it needs to build the properties so it can expand and develop . Principal Clare Davison said: 'We want to provide additional state of the art agri-tech facilities and expand our Higher Education offer enabling more students to study degree programmes on their doorstep. 'The capital released from the sale of land will enable the college to embark on a programme of redevelopment and will have a positive impact on meeting local housing needs.' The plans to change the use of the two sites and build the 70 homes will be considered by West Dorset District Council in the near future. Born in 1840, Thomas Hardy is now one of the most celebrated novelists and poets in English history - not least because of his descriptions of rural Dorset life. He immortalised the county where he grew up as 'Wessex', setting all of his major novels in the somewhat idealised, fictionalised world. To him as to many Romantic and Victorian authors, the countryside represented a more pristine life than the grunting machinery which heralded the Industrial Revolution, but also one more closely entwined with mankind's animalistic desires. Celebrated: Thomas Hardy created a pastoral picture of the rural England in which he grew up . Wessex was first used in Far From the Madding Crowd, which told the story of an independent-minded young woman who refuses to marry humble shepherd Gabriel Oak. The girl, Bathsheba Everdene, comes into money and moves away - but is forced to seek Gabriel's help when her sheep begin dying. A long and complex friendship follows, and slowly Bathsheba realises the friendship of her youth - not the temptations of the wider world - is the key to her happiness. Gabriel asks her to marry him a second time and she accepts. Wessex was also used in Hardy's 1892 masterwork Tess of the d'Urbervilles - whose original subtitle was A Pure Woman Faithfully Presented. She is the daughter of a poor family which is corrupted at the beginning of the novel by a rumour that she is descended from nobility. But when she goes to meet the libertine Alec D'Urberville, instead of inheriting his family's estate she starts working on it - before being raped by Alec in a symbolic, and real, loss of innocence. As her life unravels it does so in that same country setting, and after she finally stabs Alec to death it is to Stonehenge that she walks to await her fate. Wessex itself was named after the Medieval English kingdom which took in much of the south west, but its borders were not the same and changed from novel to novel. In reality it was a poor area which changed little in hundreds of years and was blighted by a devastating death rate in sickness and childbirth' Hardy turned away from novels in the 1890s after Tess of the D'Urbervilles and Jude the Obscure received mixed reviews, and began writing poetry instead. He died in 1928 and his ashes were interred in Poets' Corner at Westminster Abbey.","Agricultural college lodged plans for 70 homes at Lower Bockhampton .

"France has quietly scrapped its 75 per cent income tax on millionaires. The super tax of Socialist President Francois Hollande was promoted in 2012 as a symbol of fairness, a financial contribution from the wealthiest at a time of economic crisis. But it netted only a fraction of its projected proceeds and has been rewritten as a 50 per cent tax paid by employers. The super tax of Socialist President Francois Hollande, pictured, was promoted in 2012 as a symbol of fairness, a financial contribution from the wealthiest at a time of economic crisis . President  Hollande's super tax was rejected by a court, rewritten and ultimately netted just a sliver of its projected proceeds. It ends on Wednesday and will not be renewed. The tax of 75 percent on income earned above one million euros was promoted in 2012 by the newly-elected Hollande as a symbol of a fairer policy for the middle class, a financial contribution of the wealthiest at a time of economic crisis. But the government was never able to fully implement the measure. It was overturned by France's highest court and rewritten as a 50 percent tax paid by employers. Faced with a stalling economy and rising unemployment, the government reversed course in 2014 with a plan to cut payroll taxes by up to 40 billion euros ($49 billion) by 2017, hoping to boost hiring and attract more investments. Actor Gerard Depardieu criticised the tax and took Russian citizenship - he is pictured with Vladimir Putin . It affected only a small number of taxpayers, but triggered huge protests in business, sporting and artistic communities. Actor Gerard Depardieu criticised it and took Russian citizenship and football clubs threatened to boycott matches for fear that 114 of their players or coaches would be taxed. The final version of the tax allowed them to minimize the burden. Tax experts said it had a devastating impact on the attractiveness of France for foreigners. The tax is estimated to have raised £328 million. By comparison, France's budget deficit has soared to well over £62 billion.","France has quietly scrapped its 75 per cent income tax on millionaires .

"As the New Year rolled in, so did a number of key legislation changes in the areas of health, welfare, immigration and even the environment. From January 1, new Commonwealth Seniors Health Card holders will be subject to a far stricter income test which from now on will include assessments of non-taxable superannuation income. This means that the card, which provides holders with discounts for services including medical expenses and public transport, will be far more difficult to obtain for many. Scroll down for video . From January 1, new Commonwealth Seniors Health Card holders will be subject to a far stricter income test while recipients of the Disability Support Pension will be forced to take shorter holidays or risk having their payments cancelled . The Disability Support Pension will also be affected by legislation changes in 2015, with the government announcing that recipients will have their payments cancelled if they travel overseas for longer than four weeks – a reduction from the previous six week law.

From December 31, solariums across NSW were forced to close or cancel their tanning services or risk a fine of up to $44,000, while Queensland made the change from New Year's Day. The Cancer Council website states: 'A recent review of the research on the link between skin cancer and solarium use found that the risk of skin cancer from any use of a solarium was 20 per cent. This rose to 59 per cent for people who used solariums before 35 years of age.'

Love birds who want to bring their foreign partner into the country to work or live will have to pay up to $6865 to do so, under new laws in the coming year. This is an increase of over $2000 that is likely to bring the government over $373 million in revenue, Fairfax reports. The environment, at least, will be better protected under new laws that will see smoking banned in all NSW national parks from next year. The state national parks website states the ban will reduce the risk of accidental bushfires and littering and will apply: 'to picnic areas, campgrounds, accommodations, beaches, lookouts, walking tracks, and on national park roads'. Any corporation that fails to comply with the environmental authority regarding a contamination order in the new year, will be fined $1 million instead of the former $137,500 fee.

In Western Australia, people who bite or spit at police officers will undergo a mandatory blood test from Thursday. Officers previously had to wait up to six months for their own test results if they were suspected of having contracted an infectious disease in the line of duty. Under the new laws a person suspected of having transferred bodily fluids such as semen, blood and saliva, to an officer will have their blood tested for infectious diseases and those who fail will be fined $12,000 or serve 12 months in jail. This year, the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Act has also been strengthened, with stronger penalties in place. 'Athletes and other persons must not work with coaches, trainers, doctors or others who are ineligible because of an anti-doping rule violation or who have been criminally convicted or professionally disciplined in relation to doping,' one section of the new regulations state.","From January 1, new Commonwealth Seniors Health Card holders will be subject to a far stricter income test .

"A battered Nikon camera bought on eBay is believed to have once belonged to missing war photographer Sean Flynn who disappeared in Cambodia. Flynn, the son of Hollywood actor Errol Flynn, vanished in April 1970 after travelling to the country when the Vietnam war spilled into Cambodia when he was 28. Attempts to find out what happened to Flynn and fellow American photojournalist Dana Stone, who was also on the assignment, have drawn a blank and he was declared dead in absentia in 1984. Discovery: A battered Nikon camera bought on eBay (right) is believed to have once belonged to missing war photographer Sean Flynn (left) who disappeared in Cambodia . However, freelance photographer Paul Turner from Fishguard, in Pembrokeshire, south-west Wales, has bought what he believes was Flynn's old Nikon F camera on the online auction site. The model, which dates back to the 1960s, has been scratched with the faded initials SF on its base. 'The camera was said to have been found in a French flea market and is supposed to have come from Indo-China, which could mean Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos or anywhere in that part of the world,' said Mr Turner, 71. 'It was in a pretty bad state, if I’m honest, which is why I managed to get it for just £51.' Buyer: Freelance photographer Paul Turner from Fishguard, in Pembrokeshire, south-west Wales, has bought what he believes was Flynn's old Nikon F camera . Mr Turner had been cleaning the camera when he noticed that SF had been carved into it, . 'That got me wondering more and more whether it might have once belonged to Sean Flynn,' he said. 'According to the serial number it was built between November 1967 and January 1968, which is the right time frame, and it is documented that Flynn — like most Vietnam War photographers — did occasionally use a Nikon F. 'I then looked up the list of photographers who were killed or went missing in Vietnam and Flynn was the only one with those initials at that period. Hollywood royalty: Flynn (right), the son of Hollywood actor Errol Flynn, (left) vanished in April 1970 after travelling to the country at the height of the Vietnam war when he was 28 . Family: Errol and Sean Flynn are pictured together in London in 1956 when Sean was a teenager . 'A magnifying glass shows the initials were carved before the scratches appeared, indicating they were done when the camera was new. 'As one myself, I can state with complete certainty that any photographer putting his camera down with a dozen others in a camera pool would definitely leave his initials on it to avoid any confusion.' Flynn and Stone disappeared after they were  captured by communist-led guerrillas at a roadblock. Two hours earlier the young friends had been pictured setting off on motorbikes to investigate reports that a Vietcong patrol was in the area. Disappearance: Flynn and cameraman Dana Stone (right) disappeared after they were apparently captured by communist-led guerrillas at a roadblock . The two men’s failure to return sparked widespread speculation about their fate that persists to this day, whilst their dare-devil approach, dangerous assignments and mysterious disappearance inspired the 2010 film The Road to Freedom. Mr Turner believes the riddle over whether the camera did indeed belong to Flynn could one day be solved. 'Nikon could establish from its serial number who originally bought it,' he said. 'I’m sure the guy who put that camera on eBay can have had absolutely no idea of its possible history. “If I knew I had Sean Flynn’s camera, I definitely wouldn’t have auctioned it on eBay — I’d have gone straight to Sothebys.' Born in May 1941, Sean Flynn was the only child to be born to actor Errol Flynn and his first wife, French actress Lili Damita. As a teenager, Flynn had appeared in an episode of his father's television show, The Errol Flynn Theatre as well as several films, but grew tired of acting and tried his hand at being a safari guide in Kenya and a sing, eventually turning to photojournalism. He travelled to Vietnam as a freelance photographer in 1966 and soon developed a reputation for being among a group of daredevil photojournalists who were prepared to go into combat in order to get the best pictures, and spent some time embedded with Special Forces units. Vanished: Dana Stone (left) and Sean Flynn (right) were captured by communist guerrillas at a roadblock . After taking time out to appear in his final film, and a stint covering the Arab-Israeli war in 1967, Flynn returned to Vietnam to make a documentary about the conflict. In early 1970 he travelled into Cambodia, but on April 6, while working for Time magazine, he and cameraman Dana Stone were captured by communist guerrillas at a roadblock while  riding rented motorcycles from Phnom Penh to a Cambodian war zone. They were never seen or heard from again, and their remains have never been found - sparking a number of theories about what may have happened to them. The most widely-held theory is that they were held captive for more than a year before being handed over to and killed by rebel soldiers known as the Khmer Rouge in June 1971. However, others have speculated that Flynn survived and may even still be alive. Damita had spent thousands searching for her missing son, but had him declared dead in 1984. She died ten years later. In March 2010 a British team part-funded by Flynn's half-sister Rory believed they had found Flynn's remains at a grave site in the eastern Kampong Cham province, but DNA tests found no match to members of his family. Flynn's life has inspired The Clash song Sean Flynn, and the 2011 film The Road To Freedom.","Photojournalist, 28, vanished in 1970 at the height of the Vietnam War .

"A young filmmaker has remade one of the most successful movies ever - Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark - by putting his family puppy in the starring role. Zach King, 23, from Portland, Oregon, used his Boxer puppy Indy to create a short homage to Steven Spielberg's action classic called Indiana Bones and the Raiders of the Lost Bark. The five minute film recreates famous scenes from the original movie, including when Harrison Ford's character uses his whip to swing across a gap and also the moment he rescues his hat from under a closing door. It also features Indiana Bones running to escape a giant rolling boulder. But rather than facing evil Nazi soldiers looking for world domination, the canine Indy has to face a rather cuter enemy - kittens. It is the latest in a number of animal based remakes that Mr King has produced including Jedi Kittens and Jedi Kittens Strike Back. Mr King said it took him and his friend Jadon Gauthier several days to film the Indiana Bones film, which charts the puppy searching for his lost bark. They created outfits and props for the animals out of pieces of cardboard. Writing on his YouTube channel FinalCutKing, he said: 'This video was created with 3 rolls of duct tape, 108 glue sticks, 18 large boxes of cardboard, a few all nighters with an adorable puppy.' Mr King has even had a special film poster by artist Josh Kenfield made to go along with the movie. Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark, directed by Stephen Spielberg in 1981, is one of the highest grossing movies ever made and won five Oscars. Zach King's puppy Indy took the starring role played by Harrison Ford in his short Indiana Jones remake . The original Indiana Jones films starred Harrison Ford in the lead role as the whip cracking archaeologist and were some of the most successful action movies ever made by combining comedy, fantasy and adventure . Artist Josh Kenfield produced a movie poster based on the original to go with the spoof Indiana Bones film . He is already well known on Vine for his cleverly edited six second videos that appear to show him doing impossible magic tricks. A cinema and media arts graduate he won YouTube's NextUp Creators Contest in 2013. Earlier this year Mr King told the Independent that he would like to move on from short films to one day direct his own action adventure feature film. He said: 'Someday I would love to direct feature films – action-adventure titles would be the dream genre to produce. 'But I'm loving being an online content creator right now and I have a large audience so I want to keep creating content for them.'","The five minute film was created by Zach King using his Boxer puppy Indy .

"It's common for students to pile on the pounds while at university. But sport and physical education graduate Sophie Tucker was left feeling bloated and unattractive after she ballooned to a size 16 while studying. Three years of heavy partying and a diet of late-night kebabs and pizzas had caused the 23-year-old's weight to rise to 12st 5lb - despite her fitness degree. Sophie went from a size 16 and 12st 5lb (left) to a toned 9st 7lb and  size eight (right) Sophie (left) says the pictures taken of her on her graduation day were the motivation for her weight loss . She was also unable to exercise after injuring herself while playing rugby. But it wasn't until Sophie, from Cardiff, Wales, saw how large she looked in her graduation photos that she was motivated to lose weight - shedding nearly four stone by changing her diet and introducing an exercise programme. She swapped skipping breakfast for a healthy bowl of porridge, and snacked on fruit rice cakes and protein brownies, instead of crisps, chocolate bars and fast food. Sophie also tucked into scrambled eggs with spinach for lunch - ditching the pasta bakes and shop-bought sandwiches she relied on at university - and ate chicken and fish with sweet potatoes and vegetables for dinner, instead of pasta or junk food. Motivated by the pictures (right) Sophie totally transformed her body through intensive exercise (left) Sophie said: 'I remember being really unhappy and embarrassed about my weight in my final year of university. 'After three years of heavy drinking and eating fast food, I managed to pile on stones after injuring myself playing rugby. 'I became comfortable in my relationship and I was really lazy with my cooking but I think after seeing my photographs from my graduation this was a massive wake up call for me. 'My dress was a size 16 and I was ashamed of the photographs.' Breakfast: Typically would skip breakfast . Lunch: Pasta Bake, Shop bought wraps or sandwiches . Dinner: Pasta or Fast Food . Snacks: Crisps, Chocolate Bars and Fast Food . Breakfast: Protein porridge . Lunch: Scrambled eggs with spinach . Dinner: Chicken or fish with rice or sweet potato and vegetables . Snacks: Quest bars, fruit rice cakes, protein brownies . Like many students at the start of university, Sophie's social life involved plenty of calorie-laden alcohol and, away from the watchful eye of parents, her diet became unhealthy. She also found she was eating more junk food after going for nights out drinking. Sophie added: 'Initially the graduation photos worked wonders to motivate me. Sophie gained weight during university with regular drinking and junk food (right), but now has changed her lifestyle, training regularly in the gym and eating a balance diet (left) 'I would refuse to go clothes shopping as nothing looked good on me anymore and through constantly moaning about my weight and how unhappy I was, I was recommended by a friend to the LDN Muscle Bikini Guide.' Fed up, Sophie swapped her 'lazy' lifestyle for going to the gym with help from LDN Muscle. On its website, the weight training programme says it aims to promote a 'natural, lean and aesthetic physique'. Doing a mix of exercises, Sophie also began learning about nutrition and tailored her meals to suit her exercise regime, managing to lose 3st 7lb, reaching 9st 7lb and shrinking down to a size eight. Sophie documents her weight-loss progress with selfies, showing increasingly toned abs, right . The dramatic change in lifestyle resulted in Sophie quickly losing the pounds and she is currently completing her one-year teacher training qualification at the University of Swansea. 'I was drawn in to buying the guide after being so impressed with the transformations,' she said. 'And I am so glad I took the plunge. 'LDN Muscle have taught me so much about nutrition which I had no idea about before. 'I finally enjoyed going to the gym and didn't feel as though it was a chore and I haven't looked back since.'","Sophie Tucker gained weight at university with alcohol and junk food .

"A 17-year-old has been charged with the murder of a pizza delivery man who was killed on the job in Alabama last weekend. Father-of-four Najeh Masaeid, 63, a Jordanian immigrant, was delivering a Dominos order to an apartment building in Birmingham, but when he got there it was vacant. Corey Arrington Jr is accused of killing Mr Masaeid during a robbery. Killed: Najeh Masaeid, 63, was found dead in Brimingham, Alabama, on Sunday while delivering a Dominos pizza, in what police believe was a set-up robbery . Family man: Tributes have been pouring in for Masaeid, a father-of-four who has been described as honorable, hard-working, energetic and funny. A GoFundMe page set up for his family has received over $65,000 . He is in custody and undergoing questioning, held on a $100,000 bond for the robbery charge. There is no bond for the murder charge, AL.com reported. Mr Masaeid's body was found in a hallway, having died of blunt force trauma to the head, in what police believe was a premeditated robbery. However the owner of the Domino's shop where Masaeid had worked for over 15 years said Masaeid likely only had about $20 on him. 'He came here for the American Dream and it was shattered by American greed,' Masaeid's daughter, Jordan Hosey, told AL.com. 'Where's the justice in that?' 'Nothing is free. You work. You pay for what you want. You don't get free.' 'He really valued an honorable dollar.' Police evacuated the surrounding apartments before going into the one that was on Masaeid's order, only to find it empty. No one in the building reported anything out of the ordinary. Mrs Hosey said her father and mother moved to the US almost 20 years ago. He took a job at Dominos and worked 80 hours a week to afford a modest apartment for his family in Shelby County. Favorite employee: Masaeid had worked at the same Dominos for 15 years and was loved by his colleagues . Jokester: Masaeid has been described as full of life and someone who could always make a person laugh . Mrs Hosey further explained the story of her father on a GoFundMe page set up to help her mother. The family hoped for $25,000, but have already received over $65,000. Most of the donations are believed to have come from locals who often had pizzas delivered by Masaeid. 'My dad didn't make much, and I often times paid their bills,' she wrote on the page. 'He never ONCE went to the government for money, although his legal status entitled for him for it. HE never believed in this. His words to me were always ""Nothing is free, you work, you pay for what you want, you don't get free"". 'My Father was simply trying to earn an honorable dollar. Scene: The 63-year-old's body was found in a hallway at The District at The Summit apartment building . Set-up: Police said the person who placed the pizza order did not live at the building and lured Masaeid there . 'He didn't feel entitled for it, he worked for it, and it makes me sick to my core how someone felt they were entitled to his money (and drivers never carry much, he always deposits it everytime he runs back to the store) or his life over what? $20? 'My dads life was ended for $20? 'I can't bear it. I just can't believe it.' Masaeid will be buried on Christmas Day. Police are hoping people will information will come forward. The death is being investigated as a homicide, according to WIAT.com. David Daewoud, the owner of the Domino’s where Masaeid worked, said the address of the order Masaeid was delivering was changed at the last minute, which was not unusual, as people often might go to a friend's house and ask the order be delivered there. 'They’re luxury apartments that you would never think something like that would happen,' Daewould told WIAT.com . 'Unfortunately, the caller was a fake order. 'He was waiting on our driver Najeh by the stairs. And we don’t know all the details yet. 'We’re waiting on the police report. And the investigator is trying to find out how he was hit.'","Corey Arrington Jr, 17, charged with capital murder and robbery .

"Derby City Council has spent £6,000 installing three bike pumps . A cash-strapped council has been slammed for spending £6,000 on just three bike pumps. Derby City Council in the east Midlands, has come under fire from local residents  for splashing out on the 'ridiculous luxury.' The pumps, which are made by Cyclehoop, of London, cost around £2,000 to buy and install. Andy Silvester of the Tax Payers Alliance said: 'Taxpayers will be furious at this ridiculous waste of money. 'At a time when Councils across the country are pleading poverty, it's ludicrous to waste quite so much cash on this scheme. 'Those at the top of the Council need to sort out their priorities.' John Borthwick, 81, of Derby, said: 'When I was younger I used to race bikes and the very first thing you do is check your tyres. 'I think most people have bike pumps now and I really don't think they will be used that much. 'It's silly having them so close together as well. It should be moved further away, to the other side of town perhaps. 'And they certainly aren't worth £6,000 - you can buy a pump for a quid.' The pumps have been placed outside Derby's Park Bikeworks and council offices and a third will be situated at the city's railway station . Barry Glover, 41, of Ilkeston, Derbyshire, said: 'Sometimes you wonder what planet these councillors are on. One minute they're moaning because the Government is slashing their cash and the next moment they are spending money on bike pumps.' Ken Haswell, 38, from Derby, said: 'If the council had just made me redundant and then spent £6,000 on bike pumps I would be absolutely livid. It makes you think councils just can't be trusted with public money.' 'Mark Hirst, 59, from Alfreton, Derbyshire, said: 'I'm all for encouraging people to cycle but these pumps are a ridiculous luxury when the country is supposed to be broke. In an age when people have to learn to be more self-reliant, you would like to think that would include being able to pump up your own tyres.' Derby resident reacted angrily to the decision with one branding the bike pumps a 'ridiculous luxury' Derby City Councillor Asaf Afzal, cabinet member for Neighbourhoods and StreetPride, said: 'The council's cabinet has set aside around £6,000 from the Local Transport Plan to fund a series of public bike pumps. 'These provide assistance to cyclists suffering with flat or soft tyres. 'The pumps will fit varying types of valves and due to their high-volume capacity they can inflate tyres very quickly with little physical effort. 'The pumps are free to use by all cyclists. 'The pumps have been planned for key locations with high cycle usage. 'The first one was installed in the summer outside Park Bikeworks, the city centre free secure bike park and cycle hub on Full Street. 'A new pump was installed last week on the Morledge, near the Council House car park, which lies on the hub of the National Cycle Route network in Derby. 'A third pump is planned for installation in the New Year near the rail station bike park at the front of the station. 'In addition, a further pump has recently been installed near Mercian Cycles in Alvaston as part of the district centre improvements. 'This was funded through the council's capital regeneration budget. 'There are no further plans for bike pumps in Derby at this time but if successful, they will be considered as part of future transport and regeneration programmes where appropriate.'","Derby City Council has paid £6,000 to buy and install three bike pumps .

"Teeing up her next shot among the palm trees in sunny Spain, this image of a golfer could be taken from the front of a postcard. Until you look behind her to the barbed wire fence, where a handful of desperate migrants are in the process of scrambling over. This is Melilla, a town along the border between Morocco and Spain, and one of the key crossing routes for African migrants trying to get into the 'promised land' of Europe. Fleeing war, persecution and poverty in their home countries, hundreds of these men arrive every month, and will regularly rush the high wire fences in order to climb over. Scroll down for video . A golfer takes a shot on a lush green among palm trees... while behind her African migrants make their latest desperate attempt to scale the border fence separating Spain from Morocco . Many will injure themselves in their frustrated attempts - cutting their hands and feet to pieces on barbed wire, or hurting themselves falling over the other side. From there, they are scooped up by border guards who watch the fence day and night. They will be taken to a migrant centre in the nearby town where they will either be released - or deported. Many will simply return, to try their luck again another day. Only two days ago, Spain says 20 men managed to make it into the country after around 200 people began scaling the fences. Nine were injured, while another 70 spent hours trapped on top of the wire barriers, shouting slogans and asking for help to get into the country. Earlier this week around 200 migrants rushed the fence near Melilla, with nine injuring themselves . Would-be immigrants stand atop a boarder fence separating Morocco from the north African Spanish enclave of Melilla . Despite the border being protected with a 23ft, triple-layer fence, around 20 migrants successfully made it over . A man sits on top of the fence while others beg to be allowed into Spain (left) while another makes a dash away from border guards after climbing over (right) Spain's Interior Ministry said 2,000 migrants have made it across the border fences in roughly 60 attempts this year alone. The flow of migrants scrambling to reach Spain's north African territory Melilla is at double the rate of last year, an official said this week  after a video showing abuse by border guards was leaked. The head of the Spanish government delegation in the territory, Abdelmalik El Barkani, said the number of attempts by desperate migrants to scale the 23ft, triple-layer fence separating Melilla from Morocco has surged in 2014. In April, at least 25 migrants, many with bloody bare feet, were pictured clinging to the tops of fences for hours as authorities tried to talk them down. Authorities in Spain say number of migrants trying to cross this year is double that in previous years . The Spanish interior ministry estimates that around 2,000 people have made it over the fence and into Europe so far this year . Would-be immigrants sit atop the fence separating Morocco from the north African Spanish enclave of Melilla . Two migrants clung to the top of a lamp post by the fences. After hours of waiting, one buried his head in his hands. Others grimly held on to the fence, their bare feet visibly bloodied by the crossover attempt. As the weather turned cold and the wind whipped along the picturesque cliffs of the Mediterranean coastline of this section of the fence, most of the migrants eventually gave in and descended by ladder. They were led limping out of Spain. At least seven migrants had still refused to come down, including one on the lamp post, when Spanish authorities ejected journalists from the area. Morocco and Spainhave stepped up border vigilance since February 6, when 15 migrants drownedtrying to enter Spain's other north African coastal enclave, Ceuta.

Police manage to talk down several of the desperate men, who will now be taken to a migrant centre where they will either be released or deported . Human rights groups and witnesses protested after it emerged Spanish security forces fired rubber bullets at the immigrants. Earlier this month Spanish border police at Melilla opened a suitcase to find a sub-Saharan man stuffed inside. Officers confiscated the suitcase on Sunday after spotting a man struggling to lug a large and oddly-shaped bag at the border near the Moroccan town of Beni Ansar. When the border guards gave chase, the suspect, a Moroccan national who resides in Spain, carried on trying to drag it away. Once the officers caught up with the man, they arrested him and opened his load to reveal the contents of the suitcase. Inside they found a contorted 19-year-old would-be migrant from Mali.
