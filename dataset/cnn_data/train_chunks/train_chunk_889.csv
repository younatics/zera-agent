"By . Sophie Jane Evans . London is facing more than a week of travel chaos as an eight-day strike by Tube power workers gets underway tonight. Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union and Unite are due to walk out from 8pm as part of a long-running row over pensions and working conditions. Union leaders have warned that the strike could 'close the entire Tube system', causing 'severe disruption' to commuters in the capital. Scroll down for video . Chaos: London could face more than a week of travel chaos as an eight-day strike by Tube power workers gets underway tonight. Above, commuters queue for the Northern Line during a previous strike in April this year . But London Underground (LU) has insisted that the industrial action will have no impact on Tube services. Today, Mick Cash, RMT acting general secretary, said the walkout follows the failure of last-ditch talks between union members and LU. 'This dispute is over an all-out attack on the power control grade that would hit pensions, length of service and working conditions and damage the futures of this key group of Tube workers,' he said. 'Management’s claim that they can run the system without them is both provocative and dangerous. Around 40 . technicians based at the power control room at Blackfriars, which oversees . power supply for the entire Tube network, are due to walk out from 8pm tonight. The . dispute involves employees who transferred to other organisations years . ago, then returned to London Underground (LU) management with different . pensions and working conditions. A previous strike in May was called off for last-ditch talks, but these have reportedly now broken down. Unions . have warned the strike, which would still be on when the Tour de France . cycle race visits London on July 7, could 'close the entire system' if . an agreement is not reached. But LU has insisted that the industrial action will have no impact on Tube services. 'These staff are effectively the national grid for London Underground and this action will have the most severe consequences for Tube operations, but has been forced on us by management wrecking the earlier talks.' He added that there was still time to head off the strike, which will continue until 7.59pm on July 9. Around 40 technicians based at the power control room at Blackfriars, which oversees power supply for the entire 270-station Tube network, are expected to walk out tonight. The dispute involves employees who transferred to other organisations years ago, then returned to LU management with different pensions and working conditions. A previous strike in May was called off to allow last-ditch talks, but these have reportedly now broken down. Unions have warned the strike, which would still be on when the Tour de France cycle race visits London on July 7, could affect all Tube services if an agreement is not reached. A Unite spokesman said: 'The blame for any disruption will lie with the management because this dispute should have been resolved weeks ago. 'The travelling public faces the very real prospect of their journeys being disrupted because of the irresponsibility of the management.' However, Richard Jones, London Underground’s head of command and control, said: 'Due to detailed planning there will be no visible impact on the network should the strike action go ahead. Previous disruption: Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union and Unite are due to walk out from 8pm as part of a row over pensions and working conditions. Above, commuters crowd on to a platform on April 29 . 'We remain committed to discussions with Unite, TSSA and RMT representatives around working terms and conditions for staff in our power control team. 'I urge them to continue with constructive discussions rather than threaten pointless industrial action.' The strike comes just months after Tube workers caused severe delays and travel chaos in the capital by walking out for 48 hours over plans to close ticket offices.","Strike by London Underground (LU) power workers gets underway at 8pm .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . Black students have achieved the biggest progress in their exam results of any ethnic group in Britain, it was today revealed. New figures show 58.1 per cent of black pupils scored five A* to C grade passes at GCSE last year, a rise of 8.8 per cent since 2010. They achieved the greatest rise in both English and maths - with 76.2 per cent and 74.3 per cent of students reaching their expected level of progress. Success: Black pupils have achieved the biggest progress in their exam results of any ethnic group in Britain . Meanwhile, just 70.4 per cent and 70.7 per cent of all UK pupils made their predicted grades, according to the the Department of Education statistics obtained by The Independent. It means black students have narrowed the gap between their GCSE results and the national average by more than half in four years - from 5.8 per cent in 2009 to 2.5 per cent last year. The improvement in test and exam grades was most significant among black boys from poor families and in sponsored academies, the figures published today showed. The rise in progress could be due to the 2011 introduction of the English Baccalaureate, which has encouraged schools to enter thousands more pupils for the core academic subjects. Difference: In GCSE English and maths, 76.2 per cent and 74.3 per cent of black students reached their expected level of progress last year. This is compared with just 70.4 per cent and 70.7 per cent of all UK pupils . The performance measure ranks schools based on the percentage of students who achieve 5+ A*-C grades in English, maths, science, a language and a humanities subject. It also allows institutions to designate 'pupil premium' funding to disadvantaged pupils, enabling them to address the underlying inequalities which exist between such students and their peers . And it was not just GCSE results in which black students showed a significant improvement. According to the statistics, 73 per cent of 11-year-olds of black ethnicity reached the expected benchmark in maths, reading and writing exams last year. Exams: The figures were published today in a league table showing the exam performance of ethnic groups . This is just two percentage points behind the national . average - a smaller gap than the five percentage points difference in 2010. Schools Minister Lord Nash said: 'For years black pupils' results have lagged behind their peers but that gap is being eroded at all levels - the government’s school reforms are . helping thousands more black pupils, including the poorest, to do well . at primary school, thrive in their GCSEs, and then succeed in life. 'It . is particularly through sponsored academies, where long-term . under-performing local-authority-run schools are being turned around by . brilliant sponsors, that black pupils are benefiting. 'There are . proportionately far more black pupils in academies than in council . schools, and the improving performance of black pupils is reflected in . the improvements in academies.' A Department of Education spokesman told MailOnline that the latest figures showed how the government’s education reforms . are 'raising standards among black pupils more quickly than any other . ethnic group'. Earlier this month, it was revealed that dozens of exam qualifications in subjects, such as film studies and home economics, are to be axed. Regulator Ofqual plans to cull 14 GCSEs and 29 AS and A levels, while reforming other qualifications. Media studies, for example, is to be revamped at GCSE and AS-level and scrapped at A-level under the proposals. The GCSEs planned to be discontinued include expressive arts, electronics, catering, home economics, manufacturing, engineering, performing arts and humanities. The aim is to make qualifications in different subjects ‘similar in their level of demand and assessment structure’ and to cut out ‘similar or overlapping’ courses.","58.1 per cent of black pupils scored five A* to C grades at GCSE last year .

"By . Paul Collins . Adrian Chiles endured some difficult moments during ITV's improvised coverage of England's game against Honduras in Miami. After the players were forced off midway through the first half due to an electrical storm, Chiles was forced to improvise to fill over 40 minutes of coverage on national television. The ITV presenter was struggling with the heat in Miami with sweat patches apparent before kick-off. Hot and bothered: ITV presenter Chiles felt the heat during England's warm-up game in Miami .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . It’s unusual for Apple not to be leading the way when it comes to product design, but new reports claim when it comes to its iWatch the firm is having to play catch up with Motorola. During a trip to Taiwan, a New York tech analyst said an Apple supplier revealed a number of features of the much-rumoured device, including a rounded face and slim design. This would resemble how the Moto 360 looks -  and contradicts previous reports the watch would have a curved, or square screen. Scroll down for video . New York analyst Brian Blair claims an Apple supplier has revealed the iWatch will have a rounded face, similar to the Moto 360, pictured, come in male and female versions, and will go into production in July. Previous reports suggested it would have a curved, or square screen like the G Watch and Samsung's Gear range . Speculation . around Apple's iWatch began at the end of 2012 and a rumoured release . date was initially set for the fourth quarter of 2013. Chinese websites reported in December 2012 that the computer giant was working with chip-maker Intel on a wrist-worn gadget. It was said to have a 1.5inch screen and use Bluetooth to communicate with other devices, including an iPhone. Other . rumours suggest the iWatch will feature Siri voice controls that let . users dictate messages, rather than use the tiny screen. The watch could also be used as a remote control to change music tracks or pause video, on the phone or tablet. In July last year, reports in the Financial Times said Apple was hiring outside help to tackle design problems with its iWatch. Last month, an analyst said the device will come in 'his' and 'hers' models and cost 'thousands' of dollars. If the rumours are true, Apple could announced the device at its annual September event. The reports were made by Brian Blair from Rosenblatt Securities. According to his supply chain sources, the iWatch will be designed to look like a traditional watch, and move away from the chunky, square look of the G Watch and Samsung’s Gear range. Motorola announced its own plans for a round, Android-powered smartwatch earlier this year and Blair's sources claim Apple’s version will be almost identical, if not a little thinner. As Business Insider noted, Apple’s icons have rounded edges and this would suit a circular face. Blair’s source also confirmed previous rumours that the iWatch would be available in ‘his’ and ‘hers’ models, and will go into production from July. The design is similar to concepts created by Mark Bell from Belmdesigns. Bell’s concept incorporates the rumoured . Healthbook fitness features that leaked in March, but experts believe . Apple could additionally be working on a separate wristband specifically . designed to track health. Google announcement comes just a week after sources revealed Taiwan's Quanta Computer Inc will start mass production of Apple first smartwatch in July, and the much anticipated timepiece will be revealed in October. Pictured is a concept design of what the iWatch may look like . By comparison, the LG G Watch, pictured, has a square, 2-inch display and runs Android Wear - a streamlined version of Google's current operating system seen on phones and tablet. The Samsung range of Gear devices similarly chose a square, rather than rounded design . The Moto 360, pictured, is expected to launch at Google's I/O in June, followed by the iWatch in September . Earlier this week, during the unveiling of its latest G3 handset, LG gave a sneak peek of its square Android-powered G Watch. All three - the Moto 360, the G Watch and the iWatch - are expected to launch later this year. It’s likely the Moto 360 will be announced at Google’s I/O in June, and go on sale for £180 in July, followed by the iWatch during Apple’s annual September event. Price-wise, an Apple iWatch may follow the same pattern as Apple’s handsets and sit at the top end of the market. Reports last month even stated it could cost ‘thousands’ of dollars. Although the smartwatches of Samsung and Sony haven’t been as popular as analysts predicted, Blair said orders for the iWatch are surpassing expectation and he forecasts 18 to 21 million iWatches will be sold before Christmas. Last night, Samsung revealed a new smart wristband and announced plans to let manufacturers use the same core components - much like the mobile phone market. It also revealed an online service to track the data - just days before Apple is expected to reveal its 'Healthbook' app for the iPhone. Samsung . presented its vision for wearable devices at a San Francisco event ahead . of next week's developers conference by rival Apple. The new claims about a rounded design contradict previous reports the iWatch would have a curved screen, as seen in this concept by Todd Hamilton . Tag Heuer, part of luxury goods group LVMH, said on Friday its vice president for sales, Patrick Pruniaux, who had been with the brand for seven years, was leaving on Monday to join Apple - and is expected to work on the iWatch. There . is widespread speculation Apple has been working on wearable . devices, and its products tend to use proprietary technologies. However, an open system would be a departure for Samsung as well. Its Gear wristwatches and fitness devices currently work only with Samsung phones. Smartwatches from Sony and other manufacturers tend to work with a wider range of Android phones. Last night, Samsung revealed a new smart wristband and announced plans to let manufacturers use the same core components - much like the mobile phone market.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . In a move away from the traditional pomp and ceremony that has surrounded Apple launches in the past, the tech giant has almost silently started selling its new iPad mini. Apple’s online store went offline early this morning -  a move the company always makes before adding a new product – before coming back online selling the second-generation 7.9-inch tablet. Recent reports claimed supplies for the iPad mini were ‘ridiculously tight’ and Apple may have released its new device stealthily to avoid a rush on the product. Apple's web store went offline briefly this morning before reappearing with the new iPad mini, pictured, listed. The California-based tech giant announced last month the 7.9-inch tablet would be released 'sometime in November' but at the time didn't specify a date. This release came, unusually, with no warning . Screen size: 7.9-inches . Resolution: 2048 x 1536 . Pixels-per-inch: 326 . Camera: 5MP rear-facing, HD rear-facing . Basic storage: 16GB . Price: From £319 . Apple’s latest iPad mini is the first 7.9-inch tablet to come with a high-resolution Retina display. According to figures from analytics firm IHS, shipments of the new iPad mini were expected to fall below 4 million units. Apple shipped around 8.9 million of its first-generation iPad minis earlier this year, and even this wasn't enough to satisfy demand. IHS iSuppli predict demand for the new tablet will exceed 9 million, meaning two-thirds of customers could end up being disappointed. The problem was blamed on limited production of the new Retina display. Larger iPads and MacBooks, for example, have had Retina displays for years and the technology is said to be much more expensive than the traditional screens. Apple's latest iPad mini, pictured, is the first 7.9-inch tablet to come with a Retina display. Recent reports claimed supplies of the new iPad mini would be 'ridiculously tight' because of the costs involved in making this screen. It is thought Apple released the second-generation device quietly to avoid a rush on the product . The new 2,048 x 1,536 resolution screen is said to cost 'substantially more' than the 1,024 x 768 version in the original mini, according to analysts. The 16GB and 32GB iPad mini's, pictured, will take between one and three days to arrive. While the larger devices - 64GB and 128GB - will take between five and ten days to arrive . Apple unveiled the iPad mini with Retina display at the same time as the iPad Air towards the end of October. The larger model went on at the start of November, but Apple wouldn’t commit to a sales date for the mini. CEO Tim Cook simply said the smaller tablet would go on sale ‘sometime in November.’ This is unusual for Apple. The firm prides itself on having queues out of the door the day products are released, and they’re usually accompanied with a strong marketing campaign. According to Apple's online store, the 16GB and 32GB iPad mini’s with Retina display will take between one and three days to arrive. While the larger devices - 64GB and 128GB - will take between five and ten days to arrive. There does not appear to be an in-store collection option. Prices for the new iPad mini start at £319. The tablet has a 7.9-inch screen and is fitted with a faster A7 chip introduced on iPhone 5s. Apple claims the tablet boasts 10 hours of battery life, comes with improved Wi-Fi and better LTE support.","Apple announced its second-generation iPad mini at the end of October .

A deal was struck between Saints and the Championship side after Lallana was poached from the Cherries’ academy at the age of 12 back in 2000. It was agreed that Bournemouth would get 25 per cent of any fee Southampton received for the England midfielder. Lallana completed his £23m move from Southampton to Liverpool on Tuesday and the clause in the contract came into play. VIDEO Scroll down for Adam Lallana joins Liverpool from Southampton . Making the move: Adam Lallana poses as he is unveiled as a new signing for Liverpool . Put it in writing: The contract agreed when Bournemouth sold Lallana to Southampton in 2000 . Young potential: Adam Lallana (circled) as part of the Junior Cherries under 10's in 1998 . Loan star: Lallana moved from Bournemouth to Southampton in 2000 but returned on loan in 2007 . As a youngster, Lallana was invited by Bournemouth youth coach Terry Wateridge to join the club's Centre of Excellence. However, . his potential was eventually spotted by a talent scout from . Southampton, with Lallana snapped up by the Premier League club as a . 12-year-old in September 2000. An . independent tribunal ruled that Cherries should receive a level of . compensation from Saints, with a nominal sum paid shortly after his . departure. The Saints paid £2,000 for a 12-year-old Lallana and a £1,000 finding fee. A further £5,000 was paid when signed a scholarship with Southampton and then another £10,000 was paid when he signed his first professional contract in 2006. In total Southampton paid £18,000 for the player over the years and with the 25 per cent sell-on clause also inserted, meaning Bournemouth will net a further £5.75m. England star: Adam Lallana played for England at the World Cup in Brazil . Moving on: Lallana first signed for Southampton aged 12, and made his debut for them in 2006 . Lallana returned to play for the Cherries on loan back in 2007 under then boss Kevin Bond - but it is his move from St Mary's to Anfield that will have a far bigger impact on his childhood club. Having finished 10th last season following promotion from League One, the huge pay-out will help Eddie Howe establish the Cherries in their second season in the Championship. And Howe is delighted Bournemouth are able to reap the dividends of Lallana’s move to Merseyside. 'I think from our perspective it shows the importance of youth development and bringing young players through,' he told Sky Sports News. 'This club has always done it. If you look at recent history there’s been Danny Ings and Sam Vokes. 'Of course Adam didn’t make his way through because he left but it just goes to show that bringing young players through is the lifeblood of this club. Big spender: Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe will be hoping to use the money to rebuild his squad . 'People have put a lot of work into Adam at a young age. When you invest in young talent - we get them in at six or seven like most clubs do nowadays - the work we do with them is key. 'From our perspective we didn’t plan for this so any potential money would be gratefully received but it will be up to the owner to decide what he does with it.' Howe added: 'I think he is an exceptional player. I’ve worked with him and I know him as a guy and what a first-class individual he is. Young star: Bournemouth academy scout Terry Wateridge says he could see Lallana's talent from an early age . 'He’s done brilliantly for Southampton and I’m sure he’ll do really well for Liverpool.' And the man who discovered Lallana, Wateridge who now works as a youth scout, admitted Lallana’s talent was evident at a young age. 'He just had such ability and we all loved him,' he said.

Sportsmail understands that an offer has been made this week for the Spanish international and the club are looking to recoup close to the £15.8million that they spent on Garcia in the summer of 2012. A fee is yet to be agreed between the two sides but it is believed that the initial offer is around the £13m mark, with City holding for a little more from the Russian club. On the move? Manchester City midfielder Javi Garcia close to moving to Zenit St. Petersburg . On the ball: It is believed Zenit's initial offer for Garcia will be £13million . There is, nonetheless, an expectation that a deal will go through in the coming week and Garcia’s two year spell at the club is set to come to an end. Garcia was signed by Roberto Mancini from Benfica in 2012 but has struggled to cement a place in the City side and has often looked sluggish and short quality in central midfield. The signing of Brazilian Fernandinho last year limited opportunities while the addition of Porto midfielder Fernando has added further competition for places in the City midfield.

The 31-year-old woman was discovered by security and medical staff in a block of toilets at BoomTown Fair, held at Matterley Estate, yesterday afternoon, Hampshire Police said. The festival-goer, who was at the four-day festival with her husband, was taken to hospital in nearby Winchester but died shortly after arriving, despite efforts to save her life. A 31-year-old woman was found slumped in a toilet block at BoomTown Fair (pictured), held at Matterly Estate, near Winchester, yesterday. Police said the death was not being treated as suspicious . Police said on Sunday that the woman had yet to be formally identified. The toilet block where she was found was cordoned off yesterday as officers investigated the scene. Her death is not believed to be suspicious at this time, police said. A statement from Hampshire Police said: 'It is too early to speculate on cause of death, and a post-mortem examination will be conducted in due course to help determine this. 'Police are providing support to her family including her husband, who was at the festival with her.' BoomTown Fair is a music festival where acts and music are divided between nine different districts - each with their own theme or style.

"By . Jennifer Smith . A pensioner has been jailed after offering a nine-year old girl money in exchange for sex. Keren Horinek will spend six years in prison after waving a £5 note at the child from the window of his flat in Harwich, Essex, and beckoning her towards him. The 68-year-old told police he was attracted to young children and would have carried out a sex act on the little girl if she had not run away. 'A danger to children': Keren Horinek was jailed for six years after admitting he would have sexually assaulted the child had she not run away . Chelmsford Crown Court heard how Horinek stood in the window of his flat near where children were playing on May 18. He waved a £10 note at the girl, but moved away when her mother saw him. Later, at around 5pm, he reappeared this time with a £5 note and beckoned the child towards him. Judge Patricia Lynch sentenced Horinek to six years in prison . Police arrested the man after being called to the scene by the frightened girl's mother. Horinek was jailed for six years but the judge extended the sentence for an eight year period. This means when he is released, Horinek will be on licence for eight years and could be returned to prison if he offends again within this time span. 'You have an attraction to young children and told police you would have abducted the child and would have sexually assaulted her.Mercifully, nothing terrible happened here.' she said. 'I am satisfied you represent a danger to children especially pre-pubescent girls.' Upon sentencing Horinek made a series of shocking outbursts, shouting: 'Nothing happened to her. 'By the time I’m released I’ll be bloody dead. I’ll slash my throat. I may as well say cheerio.'

"By . Luke Salkeld . A 63-stone girl who had to be rescued from her own home has been fed a diet of junk food and fizzy drinks by her mother, it emerged last night. Georgia Davis, 19, needed urgent care on Thursday but had to wait eight hours as walls were knocked down before she could be carried from her home into an ambulance. The operation to cut into her home cost emergency workers an estimated £100,000. She is due to remain in hospital over the weekend while doctors continue to test her for medical complaints including diabetes, kidney disease, spinal problems and respiratory failure. Heartache: 63 stone Georgia Davis, 19, from Aberdare, South Wales, was struggling with the guilt of dumping a mystery boyfriend . Her mother Lesley has previously spoken of her guilt over the teenager’s obesity. Neighbours of the family in Aberdare, South Wales, said it was the 57-year-old who bought Georgia’s food. One said: ‘Lesley does the shopping for the family on a regular basis just like any other mother going to the supermarket. ‘Georgia lives on processed ready-meals, sandwiches and packs of peanuts and crisps. She is also partial to sausages, pasties, chips, chocolate and chunks of cheese with bottles of coke or pints of milk.’ A 10ft by 10ft space was cut into to the top floor of the house in Aberdare, South Wales, so that the emergency services could remove the teenager . The scene as Miss Davis was removed from her home and loaded into an ambulance last week . Yesterday, the teenager remained in her private room at Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales. Mrs Davis and Georgia’s 74-year-old step-father said she was ‘doing fine’, though she is said to have been ‘stressed’ by the ordeal. But Mrs Davis refused to talk about her condition in detail. She has previously said of Georgia’s weight: ‘I feel guilty, of course I do.’ In an interview, she said she and her daughter had started comfort eating after her husband Geoff died when Georgia was five. Ambulance men, paramedics, contractors from RCT homes, police, firemen, social workers all helped in the operation . A bridge was also built from the roadside to the top floor with between 30 to 40 people involved in the operation . But she said she had later made a determined effort to change their diets – such as making her own chips instead of buying them from the takeaway. She said in the interview: ‘I wish I could turn back the clock. But if you’ve never had food addiction, you can’t understand. You try to fight it but it’s like a drug.’ In 2008, Georgia told reporters: ‘Some people choose heroin but I’ve chosen food and it’s killing me.’ In the past, she has spoken of eating ‘a couple of loaves-worth of sandwiches filled with jam or cheese or meat’ every day. This was in addition to five bags of cheese and onion crisps, two packets of chocolate bourbons, sponge cake, trifle chocolate cake, and four sausages with mashed potato and baked beans for dinner, as well as fizzy drinks. The cost of removing Miss Davis is estimated to cost £100,000 to cover manpower, plus the emergency call-out and the reconstruction of the demolished walls . The operation began just after 9am, and she was seen leaving the scene in an ambulance just after 5pm . Neighbours said she was thought to now weigh 63 stone, but added that it was impossible to know her true weight as it would require a specialist scale to measure. Friends and family said they were praying her condition would not deteriorate further. One said yesterday: ‘It had got to the stage where she couldn’t get out of bed, nurses were visiting her every day to turn her over and wash her. ‘We are all hoping and praying that she pulls through and somehow can be put on the road to leading a normal life.’ A 40-strong team of builders, scaffolders and crew from all three emergency services was involved in the complex operation to remove Georgia from her home on Thursday. Georgia lost 15 stone after her visit to a U.S. weight loss camp (left) but was piling on the pounds by September last year (right) Georgia Davis, aged 17, was weighing around 40st. Pictured with her mother Lesley . As well as knocking down walls, they built a temporary ramp from the first floor of the house to the pavement to get her out, while local traffic had to be diverted. It was the first time Georgia had left the house in over six months. Now Mrs Davis is said to be hoping to move into a new bungalow near their home – at taxpayers’ expense –  so her daughter can be taken to hospital more easily. Georgia has battled to bring down her weight for several years, attending ‘boot-camps’ abroad and trying to improve her health at her local gym. Three years ago Georgia managed to lose half her body weight after attending a £3,600-a-month weight loss camp in the US. Her mother says Georgia was always a large child, pictured here eating a lolly as a toddler . Early signs: Miss Davis was an overweight toddler, and the rapid growth has continued to this day . But after returning home she struggled to stick to her 1,500-calories-a-day diet. She also took up a strict exercise plan at a women’s gym in a nearby street, but gave up because she could not cope with the two-mile distance there and back. At the time, she told friends on Facebook: ‘I’ve got a personal trainer and life coach, I’ve got the help now, this is why it’s going to work. I want to do it now. ‘But I refuse to believe that from my house to the bottom of Monk Street is just one mile.’ She also failed to stick to the small portions of a £240-a-month controlled meal plan, telling friends: ‘I’m coming off this diet – you can only try things and this one failed. This diet is not for me but at least I tried.’ A hospital spokesman said yesterday: ‘This young lady has had a settled night and has been seen this morning by the consultant in charge of her care. ‘Initial assessments have been undertaken and she will be undergoing further assessment during the day to assist in her plan of care.’","Britain's fattest teenager Georgia Davis, 19, had 'settled night' in hospital .

"By . Michael Seamark . Retired scientist David Smythe, pictured, has been accused of being less than totally honest about his credentials as a shale gas expert . Anti-fracking campaigners describe him as ‘a world-class star of geological research’, but David Smythe was accused today of being less than totally honest about his credentials as a shale gas expert. The retired geologist and former punk rock guitarist has been prominent in highlighting the dangers of fracking and last week helped to persuade a county council to reject an application to drill an exploratory shale well. But a professor at his old university now accuses him of ‘pseudo-scientific scaremongering’. The Geological Society has also written to Mr Smythe – who has the title ‘Emeritus Professor of Geophysics, University of Glasgow’ – demanding that he stops claiming to be a chartered geologist. Glasgow University, where he last worked in 1998, has told him he must not suggest that its academics share his views. And Prof Paul Younger, Glasgow’s professor of energy engineering, said Mr Smythe – who played bass guitar in the 70s punk band The Rezillos – was unqualified to give expert evidence on fracking, having retired 16 years ago. ’He has published nothing on (shale gas) in any proper scientific forum – no doubt because he knows he would never get past peer review with his pseudo-scientific scaremongering.’ But Mr Smythe, 67, who now lives in the South of France, hit back saying he could find no publications on fracking by Professor Younger, adding: ‘So you could say he is no more an expert than me.’ In recent months Mr Smythe – who was head of Geophysics at Glasgow from 1988 until the department was closed in 1998 – has warned of the potentially serious environmental damage that fracking poses, including a huge risk of water contamination. Last week he helped to persuade West Sussex County Council to reject an application by Celtique Energie to explore for shale oil, describing its application as ‘incomplete, incompetent and disingenuous. He has also given evidence on behalf of campaigners against a subterranean methane project involving drilling 22 bore holes 800 metres deep into the Falkirk countryside. Mr Smythe suggested the process of removing the gas could result in earthquakes becoming more likely in the area and potential contamination of streams and rivers, posing a threat to human health. In a recent newspaper interview Professor Younger said: ’He falsely claims to be a chartered geologist. That’s fraudulent. It’s wilful untruth. ‘I am concerned about the damage to the reputation of the university by someone who never fails to use his university affiliation.’ Professor David Manning, president of the Geological Society, wrote last month to Mr Smythe telling him not to use the title ‘chartered geologist.’ The governing body of Glasgow University also wrote to him saying : 'Notwithstanding our support for freedom of expression, we respectfully request that you make it clear in all of your future publications and broadcast media appearances that the views which you hold and express are your own and are not necessarily representative of the views held by the university’s researchers.' David Smythe has given evidence on behalf of anti-fracking campaigns and claims to have done extensive research into unconventional energy extraction . Mr Smythe, who believes he may be an illegitimate descendant of Prince Albert, admitted that he should not have claimed to be a chartered geologist but said that it was a ‘completely trivial matter’ because he had been one once but had stopped paying his subscription in 1996. But a spokeswoman for the Geological Society said that the title required proof of ‘continuous professional development’, not just payment of a subscription. Mr Smythe, who lives in the Languedoc and rents out a self-catering apartment in his mansion overlooking the Canal du Midi, insists he had done extensive research into unconventional energy extraction. He said Professor Younger sent him a ‘very abusive email’ after he appeared on a recent radio programme in Scotland ‘ accusing me of arm-waving and talking nonsense.’ Mr Smythe, whose 1970s punk band had its biggest success with a cover version of the Fleetwood Mac song ‘Somebody’s Gonna Get Their Head Kicked In Tonight’ added: ’You could say it is sour grapes.’ The University of Glasgow confirmed Mr Smythe has right to use the title ‘emeritus professor’ and the retired scientist said he had never suggested that his views were shared by the university. ‘A lot of British academics have in effect been bought off by the oil industry. They depend on grants from that industry so they dare not speak out critically,’ he said. ‘I write reports [on fracking] for public inquiries to a very high standard because my aim is that I’m providing all the evidence if any such inquiry decision were to go to judicial review.’ Mr Smythe is advising Frack Free Fernhurst, a group opposing fracking in the South Downs national park. Martyn Knights, one of the campaigners from the group, said: ’None of this stops him from doing his job, he is still a geologist. ‘As regards the university, he has always said that it is his own opinion that he states. ‘I am not a geologist but as far as I am concerned, what he has said so far makes common sense.’","David Smythe accused of being less than totally honest over his credentials as shale gas expert .

"By . Jack Doyle . Towns and villages that allow fracking should be given a greater share of the proceeds, a Tory MP said yesterday. As ministers gave the green light to potential shale gas exploration across vast swathes of the country, MPs said support in local areas would depend on the scale of ‘payback’ for communities. Eric Ollerenshaw, a former ministerial aide in the communities department, which rules on planning applications, said the Government’s current offer was not high enough. This amounts to £100,000 per exploratory well and 1 per cent of all revenues. Prime Minister David Cameron stands in front of heavy machinery during a guided tour of the IGas shale drilling plant near Gainsborough, Lincolnshire. Fracking is likely to be a big issue in next year's general election . Fracking is likely to become an important issue in next year’s general election, with research by Greenpeace showing that 31 out of 40 Tory target seats could be open to shale gas exploration. It could also affect 24 of 31 Cabinet ministers’ constituencies. Parts of Mr Ollerenshaw’s constituency of Lancaster and Fleetwood are in the Bowland Basin, a region stretching from Cheshire to Yorkshire said to contain 1,300trillion cubic feet of shale gas – enough to cover Britain’s energy needs for decades. He backed new rules designed to protect national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty from development, but said ‘there are other issues still to be sorted’. One of these was protection of the water table, which some critics have claimed can be contaminated by fracking. The process involves pumping a mixture of sand, water and chemicals into shale deposits to force out gas trapped in them. Mr Ollerenshaw said many of his constituents did not have a mains water supply and drew directly from the water table. ‘It’s a serious [election issue] in terms of getting it right, and also in terms of what is the payback for Lancashire,’ he added. ‘We still believe there should be a greater payback to local areas.’ In addition to the £100,000 per well and 1 per cent of revenues, ministers have agreed to let councils keep all the money paid in business rates by fracking firms that otherwise would have gone to the Exchequer. It is thought councils could be in line for up to £1.7million a year for a typical 12-well site. Police in riot gear escort a tanker to a test drilling site in Balcombe, West Sussex. There has been serious opposition to fracking in Britain, partly from fears the process could contaminate underground water supplies . Campaigners have welcomed the rules restricting development in areas of outstanding natural beauty and national parks, where major fracking projects will be allowed only in ‘exceptional circumstances’. Richard Hebditch, of the National Trust, said: ‘This is a significant change. We hope it will reflect a much more cautious approach that recognises the risks of turning some of the most special places in the country over to industrial-scale extraction of shale gas and oil.’ However, Greenpeace said the rules were a ‘sham’ that would create a ‘giant loophole’ for fracking across protected areas. Spokesman Simon Clydesdale said: ‘Ministers can’t have their cake and eat it. If they’re serious about protecting our national parks, they should have made them off limits to shale drillers.’ Industry sources said there was concern that the new rules could act as a barrier to the extraction of shale gas.","Fracking is likely to become a big issue in next year's general election .

"By . Margot Peppers . A couple who were happily married for 63 years have been laid to rest together after they both passed away on the same day. Bob, 85, and 82-year-old Barbara Pettis of Holdenville, Oklahoma, had both been battling health problems for several years when they died mere hours apart on June 30. Their oldest son Clay, 59, told NewsOK that they were so close in life, it was no surprise that they ended up leaving the earth together. Everlasting love: Bob and Barbara Pettis of Holdenville, Oklahoma, (pictured on their 50th anniversary) were happily married for 63 years. They passed away mere hours apart on June 30 . 'I don't believe in coincidences, and I . didn't sit down and tell Dad that Mama was gone. But I'm sure he knew,' he said. 'Just knowing them, you wouldn't be surprised that Dad . decided to check out, too.' Per Barbara's wishes, she was cremated. Clay and his two siblings, Leslie and Jim, laid their parents to rest on July 2nd, placing their mother's urn in Bob's casket so they could be eternally together. Clay - who, with his wife Jana, had been his parents' primary caretakers for two years - said it took him a while to fully realize just how special they were. 'We had something growing up that a lot of kids don't get. The thought of them divorcing was inconceivable to me,' he said. 'We had that kind of security with them that it never crossed our minds growing up.' Bittersweet: Barbara was cremated, and her urn was placed in her husband's casket when they were laid to rest on July 2nd, so that they could be eternally together (pictured on their wedding day in 1951) He added that even though they weren't 'all smoochy-woochy, touchy-wouchy,' the couple, who were both schoolteachers at the end of their careers, shared a unique bond . 'In their voices and the way they looked at each other, you could see their love,' said Clay. 'Just in the little things.' Prior to their passing, Bob had been recovering from a quadruple bypass, a stroke, pneumonia and a biking accident that shattered his pelvis. Barbara was bed-ridden. Remembrance: The couple (pictured in the spring of 1951, before they got married) are survived by their three children, 11 grandchildren five great-grandchildren . At 6am on June 30, Clay got a call from his mother's nurse that she had passed away. He went to the hospital to be with his father, and at 8pm, Bob passed away, too. Their lives were celebrated at a joint memorial service at Calvary Baptist Church in Holdenville, where they were both active members - Bob a deacon and song leader, and Barbara a pianist and organist. The couple are survived by their three children, 11 grandchildren five great-grandchildren, with another great-grandkid due to be born this month.","Barbara Pettis, 82, of Holdenville, Oklahoma, passed away early in the morning on June 30.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Fracking could decide the next election, it was claimed today with more than three-quarters of the Tories' top target seats been opened up for oil and gas exploration. Energy minister Matthew Hancock struggled on live radio this morning to name a single village which would welcome fracking on their doorstep, . As Greenpeace claimed dozens of marginal seats were at risk, Tory MPs called for more financial compensation for areas which could be chosen as drilling sites. The Government today launched the latest bidding round for onshore oil and gas licences, which covers around half the country. Shale gas development will be all but banned in National Parks and other protected countryside – and permitted only in ‘exceptional circumstances’. The move from the Department for Energy and Climate Change is likely to be seen as an attempt to head off a potential revolt in Middle England over fracking in the run up to next year’s election. But Greenpeace warned that the licensing area also covered freshwater aquifers and intruded on 10 national parks. The Government has committed to going 'all out for shale', claiming development of the gas and oil resource is needed to improve energy security, boost jobs and the economy and bring down energy prices. But opponents say it causes disruption and damaging development in the countryside, can cause minor earthquakes and the risk of water pollution, and that exploiting new oil and gas resources is not compatible with tackling climate change. Mr Hancock, appointed energy minister in this month’s reshuffle, was challenged on BBC Radio 4 to name anywhere which is 'welcoming the frackers in' he just changed the subject. He added: ‘There is the potential under the land. Now, it is only potential; we’ve got to get out and explore where it is, but I’m also determined that we should do this in a way that is sensitive. ‘For instance, we’ve increased the planning guidelines, the protections on national parks and on areas of outstanding national beauty in order to do this in a sensitive way because we’ve got to make the most of the energy resources that we’ve got as a country, but we’ve also got to protect our beautiful countryside.’ Three areas of Britain, in the north and south of England and in Scotland, have been identified by the British Geological Survey (BGS) as prospective areas for shale gas and oil. Drilling: Proponents of fracking claim is will slash bills, create jobs and deliver energy security . Carried away: Police remove a protester from a fracking site. Today ti will be announced the controversial process is to be curbed . But the latest licensing round opens up a far larger area for potential fracking or other oil and gas exploration - though it is likely that energy companies will focus on areas where resources are easiest to access. Analysis by Greenpeace suggests that 24 of the 31 constituencies represented by MPs who are in the Cabinet are affected by the new licence area, while 31 out of 40 target seats in the Conservative's 2015 election strategy are also affected. The licencing area reaches into 92 per cent of Labour-held seats, covering 506 constituencies in total, affects 10 out of 13 national parks, 47 per cent of major aquifers and all 10 of the UK's largest cities, Greenpeace said. Greenpeace UK energy campaigner Simon Clydesdale said that putting out the new licensing round after MPs had gone on their summer holidays showed how 'politically toxic' an issue fracking had become. 'Just a few months ago ministers were falling over each other to make big announcements about shale gas. 'Now, with MPs in Tory heartlands feeling the heat and all but seven Cabinet ministers threatened by drilling in their constituencies, there could be a high political price to pay for this shale steamroller at next year's general election.' Greenpeace produced this map to show how constituencies will be affected by fracking. The orange areas are where 14th round licenses have been issued, the red cubes are territories licensed in previous rounds . Tory MP Eric Ollerenshaw warned fracking would be a ‘serious’ issue in his Lancaster and Fleetwood constituency at the next election. He told BBC Radio’s World at One: ‘We still believe there should be a greater payback to local areas. 'In Lancashire, we've been used to coalmining, we've got nuclear, we're covered by wind turbines on sea and hills. ‘So this kind of industry is not particularly new and one can see the possibility of jobs. But there still is some concerns about the environmental damage and some concerns about what is the payback.’ Cllr Mike Jones, from the Local Government Association, said: ‘Communities, through their democratically-elected councils and the planning system, will decide whether fracking is right for them. ‘Given the significant tax breaks being proposed for the firms involved and likely returns, an offer from the industry to local communities of one per cent of revenues and compensation schemes is not enough, and we are seeking a better deal for residents if extraction of oil and gas takes place.’ The analysis by Greenpeace comes after a ComRes poll of more than 1,000 people in the 40 most marginal constituencies found low support for fracking from voters across the political spectrum. The poll for industry body RenewableUK found that just 15 per cent of those intending to vote Tory thought developing shale oil and gas was a top priority for ensuring energy security, compared to 43 per cent who thought the greatest focus should be on more renewables. Of those planning to vote Ukip, just 11 per cent put fracking for shale as a top priority, while 52 per cent listed developing new renewables as the highest priority. Would-be Labour and Lib Dem voters were also much more in favour of renewables than fracking.","Greenpeace claims marginal seats most at risk from fracking .

"By . Claudia Joseph . Making a splash: The Duchess of Cambridge has been taking one-year-old Prince George for swimming lessons in the private pool at Buckingham Palace . The teenage Queen finessed her breaststroke there. A young Prince Charles sailed toy boats across it. It’s where Prince William learnt to swim — and now Prince George goes there for his weekly splash about. For, as the Mail recently revealed, the Duchess of Cambridge has been taking one-year-old George for swimming lessons in the private pool at Buckingham Palace, a place steeped in history and tradition. Over the past 76 years, nearly every member of the Firm has learnt to swim in the pool, which has survived bomb damage and outlasted a king. Yet apart from one photograph taken during World War II, when the pool was bombed, it remains an extremely private place of leisure for the Royals, with no publicly available images of the interior. Indeed, the only clues to its design stem from a letter that Sir Philip Sassoon, from the Ministry of Works, wrote to King George VI in 1938 when the pool was being designed. He requested the Monarch’s approval for the lining and walkway around the pool to be made of vitreous mosaic tiles rather than the glazed variety as it was ‘less harsh in appearance and less slippery’. Enclosing samples of the tiles, he suggested the edge be marked in black mosaic with two bands of green, one below the level of the water and another near the bottom of the pool, to add ‘sparkle and liveliness to the water’. As his design suggests, the pool is certainly not extravagant, and it has none of today’s usual trappings of a jacuzzi, sauna or sunbeds. But it is popular. Prince Philip still swims there every day. Although, perhaps surprisingly, it isn’t just the blue-blooded Windsors who enjoy the privilege of bathing there. According to royal author Brian Hoey, members of the Staff Sports Club can use the pool at ‘certain specified times’ when no member of the Royal family wants to swim. Although, of course, there is a special protocol. ‘The rule is that if a staff member is swimming and one of the Royals appears, they have to get out, unless invited to remain, which often happens,’ Hoey says in his book, Not In Front of the Corgis: Secrets Of Life Behind The Royal Curtains. ‘If when the staff member turns up a Royal is already in the pool, the servant, and this includes senior members such as the Private Secretary or Keeper of the Privy Purse, will not attempt to join them. It’s a rule that seems to work well and these days the Duke of Edinburgh is the only permanent royal resident at the Palace who still uses the pool regularly.’ Staff are also only allowed to swim in a minimum group of three, in case anyone gets into trouble — so that one can stay with the casualty and the other raise the alarm. And while there is no strict clothing code as such, the natural decorum of Palace residents mean you will not see overly revealing swimming attire. Steeped in history: Over the past 76 years, nearly every member of the Firm has learnt to swim in the pool (circled), which has survived bomb damage and outlasted a king . But its newest attendee, Prince George, is a particularly special guest given that the pool was conceived by the newly crowned King George VI to guard the privacy of his daughters Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret. He commissioned it when the family was adapting to its newly public role two years after the abdication of Edward VIII, . ‘While they were still living at Piccadilly, the Princesses had been enjoying swimming lessons at the Bath Club and no one had taken much notice of the two little girls in their regulation swimming costumes,’ writes Edna Healey, wife of former Labour chancellor Denis, In her book The Queen’s House. ‘But now that Princess Elizabeth was heir to the throne they attracted too much attention. ‘So in summer 1938 it was decided to build ‘a swimming bath and squash court on the north side of the Palace in one of Nash’s conservatories.’ Scottish architect James Jack Roberts, then a 26-year-old employee of HM Office of Works, produced drawings for the North-West pavilion — on the right-hand side of the palace and designed by renowned architect John Nash in the 19th century — to be converted into a pool. Though little is heard or told of the pool now, its construction was covered in the press at the time: ‘When Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret Rose returned to Buckingham Palace with King George VI and Queen Elizabeth from Balmoral recently, they found a big surprise awaiting them in the Palace grounds,’ read one newspaper article, dated January 14, 1939. Privacy: The newly-crowned King George VI (right) built the pool so his daughters Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret (front) could continue their swimming lessons without attracting too much attention . ‘The surprise was a new swimming pool, which was specially constructed for the two little princesses so they may have their weekly swimming lessons next year at their own home. ‘While the Court was in Scotland, workmen were busy digging out the pool, which is a full-sized affair with the bottom and walls of thick concrete, and now they are engaged on the final process of tiling. The pool will, it is hoped, be ready for the princesses to have their first swim in it in the spring. Princess Elizabeth, who has been having lessons for about three years, is already a fine swimmer and this year she passed with honours her test for a life-saving certificate. ‘Her younger sister, Princess Margaret Rose, although she has not been learning to swim so long, is already proficient. Almost every weekend during the summer, the princesses have races and games in their other pool at Royal Lodge, Windsor Great Park, Berkshire.’ Water babies: After the war, the pool was rebuilt and a second generation of royals learnt to swim with Prince Charles and Princess Anne (pictured with their parents in 1953) both took their first strokes there . The future Queen was already an adept swimmer as she and her sister had been taught at a young age by veteran swimming teacher Amy Daly, of the Bath Club, who also trained their aunt, the Princess Royal, at the leisure centre near their former home at 145 Piccadilly. Miss Daly never got into the pool but taught her pupils the motions by lying on a wooden bench, before they got into the water. She then tied a rope around the young princesses’ waists and pulled them along on a wooden pole, gradually releasing the rope until they swam unaided. Margaret, who was younger, plumper and clumsier, was at a disadvantage. ‘You look like an aeroplane about to conk out,’ her sister once joked. And when she clung to the edge of the pool, Elizabeth told her: ‘Don’t be a limpet.’ ‘The then Princess Elizabeth showed no fear of the water either in swimming or diving and went on to an advanced level, winning a silver medal for life-saving when she was still a very young girl,’ added Hoey. However the two young princesses barely had time to enjoy their gift before World War II broke out. On September 10, 1940, a year after the pool was completed, it was damaged during the Blitz by a delayed-action bomb. The Royal Family was not in residence when the bomb exploded, shattering the windows in the North Wing — although four days later they were in an upstairs sitting room at the Palace when it was hit for the second time, by five German bombs, sparking the Queen’s famous remark: ‘I’m glad we’ve been bombed. Now I can look the East End in the eye.’ Photographs survive of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth inspecting the damage with the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill. On the back of one picture, the King wrote: ‘Bomb exploded at 1.25am Tuesday September 10. Every window broken on all floors. The only exception is swinging lamp under garden entrance canopy.’ After the war, the pool was rebuilt and a second generation of royals learnt to swim — Prince Charles, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward all took their first strokes there. But it was an eight-year-old Prince Charles who decided it was the perfect location for an alternative hobby: sailing model boats. He even invited fellow pupils from exclusive Knightsbridge prep school Hill House — where he spent two terms, the first member of the royal family to attend school rather than be tutored privately — to trek a mile down the road to join him on his adventures. Early start: Both Prince Charles and Princess Diana splashed about in the pool teaching William and Harry to swim. Prince Charles revealed later that he had instilled a love of water in his eldest son from an early age . Fellow pupil Richard Alston, 65, said later: ‘We all made small model boats in woodwork and Charles invited us to the swimming pool at Buckingham Palace to sail them. As we went to launch ours, he brought out his replica of the Britannia. Life was not fair at times.’ In later years, Princess Diana regularly used the pool, leaving home at 7am in a scarlet tracksuit and driving from Kensington Palace to Buckingham Palace for a 20-minute swim. Leaving her bikinis for holidays, she donned a one-piece to swim up to 30 lengths of breaststroke, crawl and backstroke, to limber up for her day. Like most dedicated swimmers, Diana was loath to miss her early morning exercise. At Sandringham, which has no pool, she drove to the nearby Knights Hill Health Club, often taking Fergie with her for an hour’s swim followed by aerobics. She even swam in the Buckingham Palace pool on the first day of her official separation from the Prince of Wales and retreated there for a solitary swim on Christmas Day that year. In happier times both Prince Charles and Princess Diana splashed about in the pool teaching William and Harry to swim. Prince Charles revealed later that he had instilled a love of water in his eldest son from an early age. ‘I threw him in the swimming pool on occasions,’ he said. ‘Instead of putting him off, it enthused him.’ Now Prince George is splashing around in the pool — perhaps the most exclusive stretch of water in Britain. ■ Claudia Joseph is author of Kate: The Making Of A Princess.","Prince George has swimming lessons in the pool at Buckingham Palace .

"By . Charles Sale . Follow @@charliesale . Premier League chief Richard Scudamore‘s position as the most powerful man in English football is under growing threat as the storm over his sexist behaviour rages in all quarters of the game. The Premier League have brought in crisis management agency Milltown Partners to help keep their beleaguered CEO in office, with Scudamore facing yet more embarrassing revelations in Sunday’s newspapers. Premier League sponsors Barclays led the critics about Scudamore’s inappropriate exchange of emails with lawyer Nick West. In private, the bank reportedly said they were ‘deeply disappointed’ and do not want to see the escalating storm damage their reputation. Problems: Richard Scudamore is facing an uphill battle to keep his job as chief executive of the Premier League . But Milltown, specialists in reputation issues and privacy protection, will find it very hard to keep this controversy under wraps. Women in Football, a network representing more than 1,000 females working in the national game, have written to the interim Premier League chairman Peter McCormick, as well as all clubs and sponsors, detailing their ‘shock and dismay’ at the content of the emails and the reaction of the football authorities, saying an apology is not enough. They want an independent review and wholesale changes to governance around equality. Edward Lord, a senior member of the FA’s Inclusion Advisory Board, who has been the most vocal of Scudamore’s opponents since the Sunday Mirror revealed the email exchange, says the chief executive’s position is ‘now looking untenable’. And top London law firm DLA Piper have launched a full-scale probe into the role played in the email correspondence by West, one of their partners and the TV rights lawyer whom Sportsmail revealed on Friday as being the other major figure in the exchanges. Problems: Scudamore has enraged the game after revelations over sexist emails sent to a lawyer . A DLA Piper spokesman confirmed: ‘We uphold the highest professional standards as a firm, and this matter is being fully investigated.’ Scudamore’s situation will be scrutinised by the Premier League’s audit and remuneration committee on Monday with the FA’s Inclusion Board verdict the following day. Women in Football wrote: ‘Women in the football industry feel strongly any apology is not enough. It is important to demonstrate the Premier League’s governance on equality is not merely lip service but instead an integral part of the values of your organisation, values that are to be defended and upheld when challenged, no matter how senior the person who falls foul. We feel an independent review is essential for trust and credibility and presents an opportunity for real change.’ No place: Minister of Sport and Equalities Helen Grant has expressed her disappointment at Scudamore . A Barclays spokesman said: ‘We have expressed our views to the Premier League in what was a private conversation.’ Lord wrote on his personal website blog: ‘If Scudamore doesn’t accept the heinous nature of his sexist remarks and the impact they have had, not only on women in the game, but on the perception they create of football’s commitment to equality and inclusion in general, then regrettably I must reach the conclusion that he may be in the wrong job. ‘He should seriously think about his position this weekend.’","Premier League chief executive Scudamore in the middle of sexism storm .

"By . Pedro Oliveira Jr. A hard-charging 6-year-old girl in Portland has helped police recover one of her dad's stolen bicycles — all by shaming the thieves with a stern sign. Roxy Thompson, 6, sprung into action a few weeks ago when thieves stole thousands of dollars in custom road bikes from the garage of her home. She wrote the looters a large sign and displayed it in the middle of the front yard: . 'Shame on you bike thieves!!!' wrote Roxy, according to KATU. 'Your mom would be so disappointed! Even if she was a villain, she still . wouldn't want you to be a villain too! 'Sincerely, your resident . 6-year-old.' Six-year-old Roxy used a yard sign to help police in Portland track down one of the bikes that was stolen from her dad . Roxy sprung to action when she saw how sad her dad Rob was, after looters took half a dozen custom bikes from his garage . 'It hurt my feelings that my dad was so angry and sad,' Roxy told the station. Roxy's sign brought in a handful of tips, including a picture of a bike similar to the ones stolen from the girl's house. Portland cops tracked down the people in the photo and discovered they had bought the road bike off the street for $50. One of the department's detectives, Travis Field, hand-delivered the bike to Roxy. 'Six-year-olds can do amazing things,' Sergeant Pete Simpson, of the Portland PD, told KATU. 'I . talked to the detective, he said she was thrilled,' he added. 'It’s empowering for . her and she knows people do care and police were working hard to help.' Roxy's dad, Rob Thompson, couldn't be prouder. 'At first, she offered to give me her life savings,' Thompson, who is yet to recover a few of his other bikes, told KATU. 'That was a heart melter.'","Roxy Thompson, 6, helps police in Portland track down property looted from her home .

"By . Sarah Michael For Daily Mail Australia . Tourists are risking their lives by climbing onto and swimming near crocodile traps in order to get a picture. National parks authorities have slammed the behaviour of one man, pictured in a cowboy hat, who was spotted wading into water near the entrance of a croc trap in Kakadu, Northern Territory and posing with his thumbs up on Sunday. In a post on the Parks Australia blog, National Park operations manager Anthony Contarino shared the pictures taken by a Jim Jim Falls tour guide to warn tourists against 'tempting fate'. Scroll down for video . A man in a cowboy hat was spotted wading into water near the entrance of a croc trap near Jim Jim Falls on Sunday . Three teenagers posted another picture on top of a croc trap on Instagram with the caption 'Drunk Jess No parents Croc traps' 'After two terrible tragedies this year, these are the kind of pictures that have every ranger's heart in their mouth,' he wrote. 'This is beyond dangerous, and goes against our constant croc safety messages. 'We want people to come to Kakadu, enjoy the park and be safe while they are here. 'Tempting fate by swimming in an area where a crocodile trap is present is dangerous and irresponsible.' In another incident three 'drunk' girls were seen posing on top of a croc trap next to a warning sign, the NT News reported. The teenagers posted the picture to Instagram with the caption 'Drunk Jess No parents Croc traps'. In April this year two men were spotted fishing near a crocodile cage . This comes after the remains of 22-year-old Travis Costa were found inside a saltwater crocodile in Tiwi Islands north of Darwin last week. In June, a 62-year-old man was snatched by a large crocodile from a boat moored at the Flying Fox Waterhole in Kakadu National Park. In January a 12-year-old Aboriginal boy was killed by a crocodile while swimming with friends, also at Kakadu. The attack came at a billabong within the Magela creek system near the Mudginberri community. Crocodile traps are large steel cages with large pieces of bait placed inside them.  When an animal enters the cage and attempts to take the bait the cage door closes and  locks the animal inside. The traps are strategically placed on the banks of rivers or billabongs where rangers suspect an animal may be present, and the Kakadu rangers regularly check the traps.

They are pictured at their first joint press conference in May 2010 . In a speech in London, Mr Clegg will claim ministers could not deal with an immigration system in ‘utter disarray’ because his Coalition partners ‘came into government with the wrong priority’. ‘The Conservatives were completely fixated on the net migration target, and, specifically, their pledge to get it down to tens of thousands – a Tory rallying cry in opposition,’ he is expected to say. ‘I made sure it wasn’t in the Coalition agreement precisely because it’s unrealistic; because it’s based on a fallacy: if a million Brits leave and a million migrants come, you get net migration of zero – does that mean you’ve done the job?’ He will say the Tories have ‘softened their attachment’ to the target. ‘They’ve realised they won’t deliver it. And bluntly it’s made it much easier for us to get things done.’ Mr Clegg’s speech will also claim that after years of stalling, the Conservatives finally got their priorities right – ensuring there were proper border checks to crack down on illegal immigrants and those staying on after their visa has expired.

"By . Mike Dawes . Novak Djokovic's choice to postpone his wedding to concentrate on Wimbledon certainly paid off as he saw off Roger Federer in the final to pick up his second SW19 title. And now the Serb is finally getting the chance to tie the knot with his fiancee Jelena Ristic, touching down in Montenegro ahead of the ceremony. The couple were originally due to tie the knot on June 14, but decided to postpone their nuptials in favour of the famous grass court tournament and are now making up for lost time. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the soon to be married couple at a gala in London . Here comes the... groom: Novak Djokovic arriving in Montenegro earlier this week ahead of his wedding to long-term love Jelena Ristic . Dressed casually in tailored red shorts and a sky blue shirt, the Grand Slam number one was hugged by members of his security team as he and Jelena hopped into a vehicle at Tivat airport to be transported to their wedding venue. Ditching tennis whites for the occasion, Jelena looked every inch the ethereal bride-to-be in a flowing chiffon printed maxi-dress. The happy couple were transported to the site of their nuptials, the lavish esort of Sveti Stefan, where preparations appear to be well underway. Plenty to smile about: Ditching tennis whites for the occasion, Jelena looked every inch the ethereal bride-to-be in a flowing chiffon printed maxi-dress . Fellow Serbian tennis champ Janko Tipsarević and his partner Biljana were spotted arriving on the picture perfect Adriatic island, a 5-star franchise hotel of the international group of Aman Resorts,  as they led the charge of sporting stars preparing to see the pair tie the knot. Formerly an island, Sveti Stefan is now connected to the mainland by a narrow isthmus and features eight lavish suits, as well as 50 rooms and numerous cottages to house the couple's guests. Also seen arriving was Miljan Amanovic, the tennis star's personal physio, and Novak's tennis player brother Marko. Wedding bells! No doubt enjoying basking in his glory over Roger Federer on Sunday, the 27-year-old sportsman appeared happy and relaxed as he touched down in Montenegro with his wife-to-be as they prepare to tie the knot . The Serbian sportsman is believed to have changed his mind about his wedding at the last minute prior to the couple's planned June nuptials. Guests such as Sarah Ferguson, Richard Branson, Andy Murray, Maria Sharapova and more were rumoured to be attending the ceremony but hopefully will have now rescheduled their plans. The Serbian couple have been together for around eight years, and Jelena is often seen in the crowd cheering him on at major tournaments across the world.

The emotional support we give to each other is very important. ‘It's the same for me as well. He is very supportive and encouraging of the work that I do.’ Djokovic felt Sunday's victory had been the best of his 14 grand slam finals but, as great as his tennis was, it was the 27-year-old's mental strength that really shone through. Having won only one of his previous six grand slam finals and none of the last three, there could not have been a bigger test than having to come through a deciding set having served for victory in the fourth and seen a match point slip away. Man with the magic hands: Also seen arriving was Miljan Amanovic, the tennis star's personal physio . Brotherly love: Novak's tennis player brother Marko Djokovic was, of course, on hand to witness the lavish nuptials . But Djokovic kept believing and, after saving a break point in the seventh game, turned the match back in his favour to clinch a second Wimbledon title. He said of his win: 'It wasn't about where I was but about what I went through in this moment. I took some time to refocus and forget about what happened in the fourth set, forget about the missed opportunities and move on.

"By . Ap  Reporter . and Daily Mail Reporter . A woman whose childhood rapes by her uncle were captured on camera and widely traded on the internet wants the Supreme Court to make it easier for victims of child pornography to collect money from people who view the brutal images on their computers. Doyle Randall Paroline, 48, is being sued by a woman for looking at child pornography of her being raped as a child by her uncle . The case being argued at the Supreme Court on Wednesday involves a Texas man who pleaded guilty to having images of children engaged in sex acts on his computer. Doyle Randall Paroline, 48, of Brownsboro, Texas, is appealing an order holding him responsible for the full amount of losses, nearly $3.4 million, suffered by the woman known as Amy. Paroline was arrested in 2009 after an employee at a computer company found sexually explicit images of minors on his computer. Of the 150-300 incriminating images found on Paroline's computer, just two were of Amy. Paroline pleaded guilty and received a 24-month prison sentence, according to The Salt Lake Tribune. Amy, . now her early 20s and living in Pennsylvania, was a child when her . uncle sexually abused her and widely circulated images of the abuse, . according to court records. The . National Center for Missing and Exploited Children said it has found at . least 35,000 images of Amy's abuse in more than 3,200 child pornography . cases since 1998. In at least 174 cases, Amy has been awarded restitution in amounts ranging from $100 to more than $3.5 million. A case before the Supreme Court Washington brought forward by a child pornography victim is vying to change the way such victims can seek restitution from offenders. A woman identified as 'Amy', who was raped by her uncle and the subsequent images circulated online, is seeking $3.4 million from Doyle Randall Paroline, a Texas man found in possession of the images . She has collected more than $1.5 million, one of her attorneys has said. In another case involving Amy and a second woman, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco threw out a restitution order because it found there was not a sufficient link between a man convicted of possessing child pornography and the women. Advocates for child pornography victims say that holding defendants liable for the entire amount of losses better reflects the ongoing harm that victims suffer each time someone views the images online. Last year, the full 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans said in a 10-5 decision that victims do not have to show a link between the crime and their injuries. The threat of a large financial judgment, coupled with a prison term, also might deter some people from looking at the images in the first place, the advocates say. 'The threat that a person in the child . pornography market may well bear the entire cost of the harm done to the . victim, even if they are a ''minor player'', is likely to be a large . deterrent, especially when the harm done typically runs into the . millions for a victim's lifetime of care,' said Marci Hamilton, a law . professor at Yeshiva University. Hamilton wrote a brief in the case on behalf of the American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children. The Washington Supreme Court will take up a case about when victims of child pornography can recover money from people convicted of viewing their abuse . The money is intended to cover the cost of her psychological care, lost income and attorneys' fees. Thirty-four states, dozens of victims' rights and child advocacy groups, local prosecutors and members of Congress are urging the court to uphold the ruling against Paroline by the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. No one has intervened on Paroline's behalf. But his lawyer, Stanley Schneider of Houston, said in court papers that there is no link between the restitution ordered by the appeals court and Paroline's conduct. 'An award of $3.4 million against an individual for possessing two images of child pornography is punitive and grossly disproportionate,' Schneider said. The $3.4 million estimate on the damages to the victim was calculated by a psychologist working for James Marsh, an attorney for Amy. The Obama administration is trying to steer a middle course. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr. said the government agrees with Amy that her injury comes from the widespread viewing on the Internet of the assaults by her uncle. 'The real question is whether ... a court must impose all of Amy's aggregate losses on each defendant. On that issue, Amy and the government take different views,' Verrilli told the court. The administration said the correct answer is greater than zero and less than the entire amount and said trial judges should make the determination. The issue centers on the interpretation of the federal law granting restitution to victims of sex crimes, including child pornography. Regardless of the outcome of the court case, Congress could change the law. The U.S. Sentencing Commission recommended that lawmakers consider doing just that to eliminate confusion among federal judges about the right way to calculate restitution. Amy's lawyers estimate that tens of thousands of people worldwide have collected and viewed Amy's images.","Woman, identified as 'Amy', was raped as a child by her uncle, who captured the incident and circulated the images online .

"By . Sami Mokbel . Follow @@SamiMokbel81_DM . Southampton manager Ronald Koeman has accused Tottenham of unsettling wantaway midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin. The France international has been axed from the squad to face Bayer Leverkusen after Koeman revealed he is not ‘mentally prepared’ to face the German club. Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino wants to sign Schneiderlin from the club he left earlier this summer, but the Saints are adamant the World Cup player is not for sale. Schneiderlin wants to follow his former manager to White Hart Lane and has been angered by Southampton’s refusal to sanction his sale. He has trained with the first team for two days this week, but has also spent two days training alone as he strives to improve his fitness. Frustrated: Ronald Koeman intimated that Tottenham are influencing Schneiderlin’s stance . His desire to quit St Mary’s came to a head yesterday following a training-ground meeting with Koeman and chairman Ralph Krueger. ‘The situation is difficult, the player makes it difficult,’ said Koeman yesterday. ‘I spoke to him with our chairman and the situation has not changed — we won’t sell Schneiderlin and he has to accept that. He is not in the squad to face Leverkusen. He said he is not physically and, even more, mentally prepared for tomorrow. ‘On one side I can understand that. We told him to take the weekend off, think about the situation and on Monday he has to come back.’ Koeman added: ‘He will continue as a football player of Southampton. Now it is up to him.’ The manager intimated that Tottenham are influencing Schneiderlin’s stance. ‘I won’t go as far as to say I’m angry with him because there are some different people behind the player,’ added Koeman. ‘Maybe Tottenham is pressing the player, maybe the agent is pressing him. I know how it works. But I have to do the best for Southampton, that’s my job.’ Weekend off: Schneiderlin has been axed from the Southampton squad to face Bayer Leverkusen . However, while Koeman — who has appointed Jose Fonte team captain after the Portuguese signed a new three-year deal yesterday — claims he is sympathetic towards Schneiderlin, he has warned the Frenchman he will face serious consequences if he does not accept that his immediate future remains on the south coast. Koeman added: ‘First of all you have to know you signed a contract and respect that. We have given him two days off to think because we will not change our minds. ‘So we will see on Monday. What will happen if he feels the same next week? I will wait until Monday to answer that. But if the situation is the same next week then he has big problems.’ New man at the Lane: Mauricio Pochettino left Southampton for Spurs in May . Fonte said yesterday he hopes Schneiderlin will stay at St Mary’s. ‘It is very simple. Schneiderlin is one of the best midfielders in the Premier League,’ said the new skipper. ‘As a team-mate I always want him in front of me — he has more interceptions and more tackles than anyone else and he runs miles. We want him in the team and we will do everything we can to make him happy so he stays here.’ Southampton are chasing Argentina and Sporting Lisbon left-back Marcos Rojo, while a deal is understood to be close for Steaua Bucharest defender Florin Gardos. ‘We are interested in Gardos but until now they haven’t told me it is signed or done,’ added Koeman. ‘We want Rojo but the transfer is a question for the chairman and (executive director) Les Reed.’","Koeman accuses Tottenham of unsettling wantaway midfielder .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Furious Nick Clegg today revealed how he rebuked his staff for the WWI wreath blunder which meant he failed to write a personal dedication to the war dead. He was among senior politicians ridiculed on Monday for laying a wreath at a ceremony in Glasgow with a label just scrawled with 'From the Deputy Prime Minister' in black felt pen. David Cameron and Prince Charles both penned personal notes to attach to their wreaths, and today Mr Clegg his staff are ‘very well aware’ of his anger for failing to arrange for him to do the same. Scroll down for videos . Nick Clegg faced criticism this week for the impersonal felt pen message scrawled on his WWI wreath left at the Cenotaph in Glasgow on Monday . Mr Clegg laid the wreath alongside Labour leader Ed Miliband, who was also ridiculed for his message stating: 'From the leader of the opposition' Organisers of the ceremony arranged for wreaths to be laid at the Cenotaph in Glasgow to mark 100 years since the outbreak of the First World War. In contrast David Cameron's message read: 'Your most enduring legacy is our liberty. We must never forget' and was signed personally by the Prime Minister. The Prince of Wales also wrote his own note, which said: 'In everlasting memory, Charles'. But the many other politicians laid their wreaths with the standard labels provided by organisers. Ed Miliband was accused of being 'pathetic' and 'distasteful' after his a scruffy message read only: 'From the Leader of the Opposition'. Political aides had suggested it was the fault of the organisers for not making the offer to signatories to write their own message in advance. But Mr Clegg appeared to suggest he considered his own staff were at fault for not recognising the importance of the event, and asked for a label to write in advance. Today Mr Clegg was challenged on his radio phone-in about why none of his staff thought to ask to write a note in advance . Prime Minister David Cameron left a message which read 'Your most enduring legacy is our liberty. We must never forget' and was signed personally by the Prime Minister . Speaking on his LBC radio phone-in, Mr Clegg said: ‘Clearly everybody understands that I would much prefer to have been given the opportunity which I wasn’t given. ‘Many other people were not either. The organisers understand that loud and clear.’ Asked what he had said to his staff who could have asked to write a message, he added: ‘I have made it absolutely clear that I would have liked to have had the opportunity which I wasn’t given, to write a personal message.’ He said his staff are ‘very well aware’ of his anger at the blunder. ‘It was just a feeling of regret that I had not been given that opportunity,’ he added. The incident happened at hundreds of people gathered at George Square for the wreath-laying ceremony. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander, Home Secretary Theresa May and Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities, were among those who attended the hour-long service in the heart of the city. But anger at the impersonal labels on the wreaths briefly overshadowed a day of poignant commemorations. The labels of Mr Miliband and Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond were criticised for being impersonal and insensitive . Mr Clegg had been challenged by a caller to LBC, Alistair in Grimsby, who told the Deputy PM: ‘What happened there because now a man of your stature in your position should be ready for an event like that? You should have your own hand written note. ‘You knew that you was going to that wreath laying ceremony as did Ed Miliband. What happened and why didn’t your secretary get you prepared?’ ‘You go to these ceremonies numerous times of the year. Why had you not personally right, on your way to the event whether you’d be on the train, on a helicopter or whatever in the back of the chauffer driven car, why did you not personally hand write a note ready to slip in there?’ Mr Clegg protested that such events were organised in a ‘very sort of strict way’ and those taking part ‘basically do what you’re told’. He noted that Labour leader Ed Miliband, Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond, Northern Ireland’s First Minister Peter Robinson and the Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones all had wraths with the same scrawled label. ‘Of course if I’d been give the wreath before the note, before, I would have been more than honoured to write a note.’ Asked what his message would have read, Mr Clegg added: ‘I honestly think there’s not much point you know to sort of lurching around trying to point the finger of blame. ‘I would have wanted to express my everlasting gratitude and that of our generation for the extraordinary sacrifices that lost their lives in World War One, their sacrifice has allowed us to enjoy our freedom. ‘ .","Deputy Prime Minister challenged on radio show about insensitivity .

Stewart Lorains, who was also the team’s wicket keeper, scored 614 runs in 41 games between 2009 and 2012 after telling benefits authorities he was constantly in pain, slow at walking, and needed daily assistance with washing, going to the toilet and dressing.

"By . Mike Dawes . Greg Eden turned in an inspirational display as Hull KR re-ignited their First Utility Super League play-off push with a comfortable 62-10 win over London Broncos. Full-back Eden, who returned to the Rovers line-up after being dropped recently for disciplinary reasons, grabbed three tries, created another and proved a constant threat. The 11-try win moves the Robins within a point of eighth-placed Widnes, while London's winless streak reached 22 games. Three and easy: Greg Eden scored a hat-trick of tries as Hull KR swept aside London Broncos 62-10 . The hosts made two changes from last weekend's defeat to St Helens, with Atelea Vea returning from suspension and Jordan Atkins from injury to replace Alex Foster and Joe Keyes. Rovers made three changes of their own, with Eden, Ade Gardner and Connor Robinson coming in for former London star Omari Caro, Graeme Horne and Kris Keating. The visitors, with just two wins to their name on the road prior to the clash, really should have taken an early lead when Travis Burns opened up the London defence, only for Liam Salter to refuse what would have been a try-scoring pass to David Hodgson. But the Robins were on the board on nine minutes, Adam Walker's clever offload allowing Josh Hodgson to ease over at the posts. The Broncos were mightily close to hauling themselves level with their first real assault three minutes later, only for skipper Matt Cook to be held inches short. And that proved crucial when Rovers moved two scores ahead on 18 minutes, Eden shrugging off a poor tackle from Denny Solomona to gallop over. Hull KR certainly had the edge in terms of skill and luck, grabbing a third try on 25 minutes when Craig Hall's apparently aimless kick bounced away from the London defence and allowed Kevin Larroyer to touch down. By now the visitors were easing through the gears, Eden grabbing his second try eight minutes before the break when he showed a clean pair of heels to the Broncos defence to race home from distance. There was still time in the half for one final Rovers score, Burns booting a penalty to give the visitors a 26-0 interval advantage. It was more of the same after the break, Salter adding a fifth try moments after the restart when he raced the length of the field to score after intercepting a loose London pass. The Broncos finally gave their long-suffering fans something to cheer on 47 minutes, Atkins squeezing in at the corner after Josh Drinkwater looped a pass outside the Rovers defence. That proved brief respite though, the Robins moving 36-4 ahead when Mick Weyman pounced to score after the London defence stood and watched Eden's grubber through. Next to score was Gardner, profiting with an easy finish after Kris Welham had broken the Broncos defensive line. An eighth try duly arrived on 63 minutes, Adam Walker bursting home from close range. The men from the capital were able to conjure a second score, Atkins again after good work from Ben Farrar. But Rovers were soon to pass the 50-point barrier as firstly Weyman added his second after a flat pass from Burns, with Salter adding a second of his own on 75 minutes after a David Hodgson break. The final word fittingly went to Eden, completing his hat-trick of tries after strong play from Burns, who failed to add the extras but still scored 18 points with his boot.","Greg Eden scored three tries in comfortable win for Hull KR .

"By . Patrick Collins . As India collapsed in a clatter of wickets and a voracious England side delivered their wildly improbable victory, a crowd awash with ale and exaltation bellowed chorus upon chorus of ‘Super Moeen Ali!’ If you could preserve for posterity a single afternoon of the English sporting summer, then this astonishing occasion at Old Trafford would prove a memorable candidate. The reconstruction of an ailing England team was already proving a stirring success, but it was in this Test match, and more precisely in the course of this golden afternoon, that promise was translated into glittering performance. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Cook salutes victorious England effort . Fans favourite: Moeen Ali won the hearts of the Old Trafford support with his brilliant four-wicket haul . Hero: Ali celebrates dismissing Mahendra Singh Dhoni on a stunning day of cricket for England . Cricket has always possessed a thrilling capacity to accelerate from the mundane to the matchlessly dramatic within the space of a few moments. But rarely has that glorious quirk been so stunningly demonstrated, rarely have the odds seemed so unpromising, and rarely has the leading man carried such slender credentials. Moeen Ali, or ‘Super Mo’ as he is now known in this part of Manchester, has shuffled almost unwillingly into the spotlight these past few weeks. He came to the side with hopes of proving himself a high-class middle order batsman. He acquired a reputation for an awareness of events far beyond the playing field with a wristband supporting the humanitarian cause in Gaza. And, above and beyond all this, he has revealed himself to be the spinner who England had almost despaired of unearthing. Time and again, he made the kind of timely intervention which he has been making all series. And the manner of his wickets finally buried his reputation as no more than a bits and pieces bowler. Down with the kids: Ali celebrates and was happy to sign autographs and take photos with kids in attendance . His first success, arriving just a ball after Jimmy Anderson had made the break-through, was laced with good fortune. Drawing Cheteshwar Pujara forward, he defeated the bat and struck the pad. Umpire Rod Tucker approved the appeal, despite replay evidence that the ball was high and missing leg stump. However, India had declined the use of the review system, and the decision stood. Not that the crowd had time to waste on such minutiae, as the first celebratory chants boomed out. That fortunate success reduced India to the rubble of 53 for three, but there was nothing lucky about Moeen’s next telling blow. Deceived by skilful flight, Ajinkya Rahane drove unconvincingly, allowing Moeen any excellent sharp return catch. At that stage, India had lost three wickets for eight runs in 18 balls, and their hopes of survival were in chaotic retreat. The crowd was captivated by the man with the bushy beard and air of modest self-effacement. No matter that their local hero, Jimmy Anderson, despite being a shade under the weather, was playing his usual admirable part in the general rampage, Moeen was occupying centre stage in their raucous affections. VIDEO Cook salutes victorious England effort . Here we go again: This time it's Cheteshwar Pujara's wicket that falls at the hands of the now-named Super Mo . And everything he did, everything he tried, only emphasised his newly won eminence. Another cunningly teasing ball saw Ravindra Jadeja prodding forward with unwisely hard hands. Chris Jordan simply devoured the catch and India stood at 66 for six, with the last rites waiting to be read. Throughout the day, we had heard how Hurricane Bertha was preparing to make her entrance, that chances of play were less than poor, and that the result might be held in abeyance until late on Monday, with a draw the heavy favourite. All changed, utterly. Only MS Dhoni stood between India and a rout, but by now the script had been written. Over came Moeen’s arm, swish went Dhoni’s bat, and Gary Balance, leaping to his right, penalised the shoddy shot. At 105 for seven, the threat of Big Bertha had become all but irrelevant, . By now, it seemed that the England spinner had run out of new ways to impose himself on this extraordinary match, but he discovered a further ploy when, with India on 133, Bhuvneshwar Kumar elected to jog a second run. He was almost inviting the run out, and Moeen responded with a superb slide and a pinpoint throw. Beautiful day: There was no rainfall or signs of a hurricane to stop England in their tracks on Saturday . The crowd crowed ecstatically, England converged upon the executioner in the field, and up in the radio box, Geoffrey Boycott observed: ‘There’s more brains in a pork pie.’ Jordan finished off proceedings, but by then the heavy lifting had been done. An innings and 54 runs! It was way beyond the most optimistic expectations after an abject display at Lord’s. But the reality was blinking out from the scoreboard, and with it the information that Moeen Ali had returned figures of 13 overs, three maidens, four wickets for 39 runs. ‘Mo! Mo! Super Mo! Super Moeen Ali!’ The chant came rolling across the ground as the crowd hailed a genuinely famous victory. Half an hour after the close, with the rest of the England team celebrating in the dressing room, Moeen was down among the fans; signing scorecards, posing for pictures, enduring a few hundred back-slapping compliments. The historians informed us that England had not won in three days since 1967. But the man of the moment was not listening to the historians last night. He was enjoying the wonder of the moment, when a Test match was won and a new and welcome figure took his well-earned place at the high table of the English game.

"By . Sam Peters . Jimmy Anderson stands on the brink of greatness. Burnley’s favourite son will begin the final Test of the series against India at The Oval on Friday needing eight more scalps to become England’s leading wicket taker of all-time. The man the 32-year-old is aiming to overtake? Only Sir Ian Botham. Already England’s leading international wicket taker in all formats with 649 — of which 376 have come in Tests — Anderson has morphed from a tearaway young fast bowler, whose early career performances veered from the sublime to the ordinary, into one of the most consistent swing bowlers of all-time. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Cook salutes victorious England effort . Top man: Jimmy Anderson will be gunning for Sir Ian Botham's record as he sits just eight wickets off him . His fiercely competitive nature has landed him in hot water on occasions — most notably the recent verbal spat with Indian batsman Ravi Jadeja — but he will undoubtedly be remembered, when his career does come to an end, as one of England’s greatest. ‘James was always extremely competitive,’ said his dad, Michael. ‘I wouldn’t say he had a win-at-all-costs approach but he was extremely competitive, yes. The whole family are. We’ve all played a lot of sport. ‘Even at the age of 10 or 11, if I beat him at golf wouldn’t speak to me for a couple of days after that. When he was around 15 or 16 he grew between six and nine inches in a year, put on a couple of yards of pace over the winter and had a few lads hopping around in the nets. ‘I remember batting against him in the nets around that time and one day deciding “I don’t think I fancy that any more”. It was around that time we started to think there might be something special there.’ It was around that time the young Burnley Cricket Club fast bowler began attracting the attention of Lancashire’s selectors. Former England all-rounder Mike Watkinson was then the coach and he recalls what marked the quickie out from the rest. VIDEO Cook salutes victorious England effort . Wheeling away: Anderson goes on a celebration run after the wicket of Virat Kohli at Old Trafford on Saturday . ‘He was a quiet lad, potentially shy, very respectful,’ Watkinson said. ‘He always worked hard and was very determined. He was perhaps a little bit nervous of the environment he found himself in but he has an inner strength and confidence. ‘He had some pace and the ability to swing the ball consistently. There was a snap and a quirkiness to his action which made him slightly unpredictable and batsman always seemed to be rushed when they faced him.’ After breaking into the England one-day side as a 20-year-old in late 2002, the same year he made his first-class debut, Anderson excelled at the World Cup in 2003, taking a hat-trick against Pakistan. He took five for 73 on his Test debut against Pakistan the following year but struggled to nail down a regular place in the starting XI, with world-class fast bowlers Steve Harmison, Matthew Hoggard, Simon Jones and Andrew Flintoff forming England’s pace attack during the fabled 2005 series as Anderson carried the drinks. A stress fracture of his back the following year gave him the chance to tweak his action and to make important strength and conditioning improvements to improve his core strength and ensure it did not become a recurring nightmare. ‘When Jimmy came on the scene he was able to offer something to English cricket that we didn’t really have then,’ said his former Lancashire team-mate and his friend, Luke Sutton. ‘He was 90mph bowler with an unusual action who was young and exciting. He was different. ‘But it hasn’t all gone perfectly for him. Growing up when you’re on the international scene is tough because if you have a loss of form everybody sees it. Then obviously he had his stress fracture in 2006 and at that point his international career was really in the balance. But from then on he hasn’t really looked back. ‘However longer he plays for will largely come down to fitness. But if he remains fit then he’ll be taking wickets. If he plays for another two or three years he could achieve a level in cricket that very few people have got to in the history of the game. Real greatness.’ Multitalented: Anderson had a good go with the bat too as England dominated in the fourth Test . With more overs already under his belt than any bowler in English history, it is inevitable Anderson will have rubbed a few batsmen up the wrong way. He has worked on his mental approach to the game with England psychologist Mark Bawden, calling himself Jimmy on the field, and James off it. ‘When any sportsman plays he has an arousal state he needs to get to in order to perform at his best. If he pushes past it he won’t perform and if he doesn’t reach it he won’t perform,’ said Watkinson. ‘Some people need to get themselves revved up to a particular level. We play the game to rules with parameters for behaviour and we all know what is acceptable and unacceptable. You get out there and play hard and get on with it. We’ve never had any issues with Jimmy at all. He’s a very determined cricketer who gives you a very hard battle when you play against him.’ His combative, in-your-face on-field persona is at odds with his off-field image as a quiet, reserved man with a dry sense of humour. ‘He’s got lots of sides to his personality,’ Sutton adds. ‘He’s a very quiet guy but he’s got a very funny side to him. He’s always after a practical joke or a laugh. His favourite impression is Cliff Richard meets Luke Sutton. I find it very difficult to have a conversation with him without him breaking into that at some point.’ Next week at The Oval, his dad Michael and mum, Catherine, will be in the crowd desperate for their son to succeed. ‘I’m proud of what he’s done and what he’s achieved,’ Michael added. ‘It’s unbelievable for us really. ‘We just sit there and watch. Even now after 11 years of him playing for England you so sometimes look around and think ‘that’s our little boy out there playing for England.’ Huge influence: Anderson has been a big player during his 11-year England career and wants more records .","Final Test of series with India sees him eight wickets from a record total .

Arsenal's players have fixed the title in their sights after finding the secret to winning a trophy and hearing Arsene Wenger claim he has more attacking prowess at his disposal than he has had for years. After winning the FA Cup and the FA Community Shield, there is a mood of optimism at the Emirates Stadium that this can be the season when they can mount a serious challenge for the Barclays Premier League title. 'That is the target,' said striker Olivier Giroud. 'Last year we did well until March. We had a bad run after but we really wanted to come back and be stronger than last year. When our Germans join us we will be stronger for sure and hopefully until May.' Sharp shooter: Olivier Giroud scored as Arsenal eased to victory over Manchester City at Wembley . First of many: Arsenal celebrate with the Community Shield but will have their sights set on bigger prizes . Mesut Ozil, Lukas Podolski and Per Mertesacker returned to the Arsenal training ground on Monday for the first time since their World Cup triumph. Wenger would rather not rush the German trio back into action but Mertesacker may have to be involved against Crystal Palace on Saturday because there is a shortage of centre-halves. Laurent Koscielny came off at Wembley as a precaution after feeling tightness in his Achilles but hopes to be fit. Up front, however, there will be a wealth of options when everyone is available, with Alexis Sanchez, signed from Barcelona for £32million, adding pace and excitement. Yaya Sanogo will improve in his second year at the club and Joel Campbell has been recalled after a series of loan moves. 'We have a good quality squad and now the quantity so that's why I think we will be stronger this year,' said Giroud. 'I have played with Alexis in training and have a good understanding with him. It is like when Mesut signed. It's always easy to play with these kind of players. 'He has different qualities to me, Sanogo and Campbell. He can bring his pace and technique into the centre and he's a great finisher. Maybe he will need some more games to adapt his game to the Premier League but that's normal and he's a fantastic player so I think he will have a great season.'

Radamel Falcao's second-half penalty was not enough to secure Monaco victory in their first Ligue 1 game of the season, as the principality side lost 2-1 to Lorient on Sunday evening. The Colombia international, who missed the World Cup through injury, continued his comeback from knee surgery by playing the final 30 minutes at Stade Louis II, but his side lost to an 87th minute winner from Lorient substitute Valentin Lavigne.

After a prankster managed to hack into the party press team’s Twitter account yesterday, it seemed that Ed Miliband had come up with his most revolutionary policy so far. ‘Everybody should have his own owl,’ said the tweet that quickly took flight on social media. Shad-owl Cabinet: Ed Miliband in a mock picture on Twitter yesterday . Owl;s your sandwhich: A Twitter used the now renowned photo of the Labour leader eating a bacon sandwhich last month . The Labour Press Team was left bemused after its Twitter accounts accidentally sent a message declaring that 'everybody should have his own owl' The offer was quickly dubbed Ed Miliband's 'Harry Potter Policy', with many Westminster insiders joking that it was his most popular idea yet . Former deputy leader John Prescott was quick to reply. ‘I’ve always been Owl Labour,’  he declared. The . political blogger GuidoFawkes tweeted: ‘For more  information about the . Labour owl policy, contact their press office on 28 28 20.’ One . tweeter said: ‘We had  hoped our compulsory owl  guarantee would be a . head  turning policy, but sadly it’s no longer going to take flight. #tweettwoo’. Another, Lucy Vine, said: ‘You know...

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The Rev Paul Shackerley said he now regrets using inappropriate language on Facebook . A Church of England vicar has apologised for some unholy language on his Facebook page, his bishop said. Canon Paul Shackerley, Vicar of the Minster Church of St George in Doncaster, raised eyebrows by using the f-word and remarking that 'alas, I have religion tomorrow' in some postings. Peter Burrows, the bishop of Doncaster, met with Dr Shackerley yesterday and later said the priest regretted the inappropriate language and had removed it. 'Whilst meant in a jocular sense, he recognises that some of the language was unfitting. 'He has apologised unreservedly,' Burrows said in a statement posted on the diocesan website. 'I have received Paul's letter of apology and have been assured that this will not happen again.' Dr Shackerley - who has facial piercings, including one in his tongue - is one of Yorkshire's most high-profile vicars. Church officials were alerted to his Facebook comments earlier this year by an anonymous letter, and sparked concern among parishioners. The social networking extracts were sent, along with the letter, to senior clergy including the Bishop of Sheffield, Dr Steven Croft, and the Bishop of Doncaster. Also copied in to the correspondence were the Lord Lieutenant of South Yorkshire, David Moody, who represents the Queen, elected mayor of Doncaster Peter Davies and the Sheffield Diocesan Secretary. The posts begin at around 7pm on a Saturday and say: ‘I think I will put my feet up. ‘I've done f*** all today other than jazz lesson and visit a friend. I hear the fizz of tonic in my gin beckoning. ‘Alas, I have religion tomorrow. At least I'm not preaching this week. Status: Dr Shackerley, who as priest-in-charge at Doncaster Minster, (pictured) is one of Yorkshire's most high-profile vicars . ‘Preaching next week at St Mary Abbotts Kensington though. Best make that a good one eh?’ The comments were ‘liked’ by eight of Dr Shackerley's Facebook friends, including Doncaster Minster's director of music, Darren Williams, and prompted more foul language in response from a separate contributor. In his next post, Dr Shackerley wrote: ‘Stop swearing. There will be others watching in.’ After further conversation he arranged to meet with friends for ‘a drinkie’ in Peterborough on Saturday, March 17, and said he would be driving back to Doncaster that night in time for church the next morning. Investigation: Dr Shackerley (pictured) issued his apology after meeting with the Bishop of Doncaster, Peter Burrows . Dr Shackerley also uploaded a photograph of his posing next to a snowman he called Snowy, which was accompanied by a number of messages, including: ‘Forgive my sin of frivolity. Sin is such fun! 'But, I haven't been having inappropriate relationship with snowy, who can longer be called a ""snowman"" in the name of political correctness. A few of Canon Dr Paul Shackerley, Vicar of Doncaster's statements on Facebook: . 'Has anyone got any ideas about what gender Snowy is? As the Bishop of Sheffield invites, ""answers on a postcard of a few sheets of A4..."" But, he was talking about gospel and mission. I'm talking about Snowy!:-)’ Dr Shackerley also posted: ‘P**s myself! H, you are so funny!!! It was good to share over lunch yesterday and at the URC Homelessness ""event"". I say ""event"". It was hardly worship, was it? 'I hope you managed to get home okay. It was late by the time the URC and Methodists finished. Good job we are Anglicans eh?’ The letter which accompanies the extracts says: ‘Your priest colleague uses language that most would find abhorrent for a man in his position and pretty distasteful for anyone as a matter of fact. ‘I understand that senior members of the Diocese know of this document, but no action appears to have been taken. ‘His present behaviour makes him totally unfit to serve the Minster or the people of Doncaster, and totally unfit to serve the church at all in the opinion of many Doncaster residents.’ In an April newsletter to parishioners, Dr Shackerley spoke of the pitfalls of internet sites like Facebook in the wake of the case of a 21-year-old student who used Twitter to racially abuse stricken footballer Fabrice Muamba. Sin: Revd Shackerley posted this picture of him and a snowman online, accompanied by the message 'Forgive my sin of frivolity, sin is such fun' He said: ‘I have known employees receive disciplinary and dismissal notices for inappropriate postings.’ Earlier, the Bishop of Doncaster had said: ‘I think we all know that things like Facebook, Twitter and other social media are immediate ways of communicating ""in the moment"". ‘But we do as clergy need to be very conscious of making the distinction between something that might have what I would call a work focus and something that might have a more personal or private focus. ‘Obviously for clergy these two lives are often not completely separate.' ‘There are a number of quite complex and difficult issues for the church that have been raised by this [Dr Shackerley's case]. ‘We do take seriously the complainants' comments.’","Canon Dr Paul Shackerley of Doncaster Minster investigated by top clerics .

Yaya Toure has opened up on a turbulent summer in which he threatened to quit Manchester City for failing to celebrate his 31st birthday and then attacked the club for not giving him compassionate leave to visit his cancer-stricken brother. The Ivory Coast star stopped short of saying sorry for the bizarre outbursts over City’s end-of-season trip to Abu Dhabi, but promised to stay at the Etihad ‘for as long as possible’ and try to win over supporters by lifting more trophies this season.

Speaking on the club’s pre-season tour of America, Toure said: ‘It was not a case of me wanting to leave the club. I stayed quiet and at the end of the day it’s my decision. I will stay at Manchester City for as long as possible. ‘The matter is closed now. The most important thing was to try to focus again. Now I’m very happy to join the team and the manager.

"By . Charlie Scott . Follow @@charliefscott . A debut goal from Andy Robertson sealed an impressive win for Hull against Stuttgart on Sunday and meant Steve Bruce's side finished their run of pre-season games unbeaten. Roberton doubled Hull's lead in the 12th minute at the Mercedes-Benz Arena with a cute finish from a tight angle, after David Meyler had profited from some poor goalkeeping minutes to put Bruce's team ahead minutes before. Bosnia-Herzegovina international Vedad Ibisevic hit back for the Bundesliga hosts just before the break, but it was Hull that dominated the game in Germany and should have perhaps won by more. On the scoresheet: Andy Robertson doubled Hull's lead in the 12th minute on his debut for the club . Stuttgart (4-2-3-1): Ulreich; Klein, Schwaab, Rudiger, Rausch (Ferati 46); Gruezo (Romeu 46), Gentner (Kvist 78); Harnik (Leitner 62), Didavi, Maxim (Werner 62); Ibisevic . Subs not used: Kirschbaum, Haggui, Niedermeier, Sararer, Holzhauser . Goal: Ibisevic 39 . Hull (3-5-2): Harper (Eldin Jakupovic 46); McShane, Maguire (Chester 82), Figueroa; Rosenior (Bruce 87), Meyler (Snodgrass 61), Quinn (Livermore 87), Boyd (Huddlestone 87), Robertson (Sagbo 70); Ince (Brady 61), Jelavic (Aluko 61) Subs not used: Davies, Long, Elmohamady . Goals: Meyler 6, Roberton 12 . Attendance: 23,500 . The victory was the perfect preparation for Hull ahead of the Premier League season, with QPR first up for Bruce and his side at Loftus Road on Saturday. They made the perfect start at the Mercedes-Benz Arena as Meyler and Robertson struck inside 13 minutes to put them two goals ahead. Meyler made the most of some woeful goalkeeping by Stuttgart's Sven Ulreich to smash home the opener, before Robertson netted on his first start for the club when he reacted quickest to score from a tight angle after Nikica Jelavic's effort had been kept out. Tom Ince shone alongside Jelavic in an attacking role for the visitors, though he will be frustrated not to have troubled the scorers after passing up two decent chances. Steve Harper pulled off a fine stop to keep out Ibisevic's penalty towards the end of the half, but he could do nothing about the striker's sweeping finish from 20 yards six minutes before the interval. Opening the scoring: David Meyler had earlier put Hull ahead after pouncing on a Sven Ulreich error . Bright display: Tom Ince played well but should have scored for Steve Bruce's side at the Mercedes-Benz Arena . In the second half Ince wasted another glorious chance to score while Paul McShane failed to beat Ulreich with two attempts after finding himself rather uncharacteristically inside the opponents' penalty area. Robert Snodgrass, who replaced the goalscorer Meyler with half an hour to play, was the final Hull culprit as he blazed off target from a promising position.","David Meyler opened the scoring on six minutes and Andy Robertson, a summer signing from Dundee United, doubled their lead shortly after .

But friends of Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills star Kim Richards are hoping this time she stays, as her problems are said to be far more 'serious'. Those close to the 37-year-old told People magazine that the mother-of-four has a plethora of problems and desperately needs help. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO... 'This time it's serious': Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills star Kim Richards's second rehab visit is to treat 'severe issues' 'Kim has been to rehab more than once before,' a source told the American magazine. 'But every time is a new time, and everyone just hopes this sticks and that she gets the help she needs. It's serious.' Her recent erratic behaviour is said to have caused grave concern for those around her. 'Everyone was really worried about her,' added the source. And it wasn't just those close to her that urged Kim to check into the facility. Executives . at Bravo also told Kim that she needed help, following the recent . suicide of Taylor Armstrong's husband Russell, according to . RadarOnline.com. Relieved: Kim's family, including sister Kyle, are said to be deeply relieved that she is now getting the help that she needs . 'After Russell Armstrong’s suicide Bravo is trying to making sure that nothing bad happens to the people on their shows,' a source told the website. 'They don’t want any more tragedies on their hands.' 'Kim was told by the people at Bravo that she had to get help and that help meant going into rehab immediately,' the insider said. 'The network people were worried about her and wanted her to try and fix her problems.' Bosses at Bravo reportedly told Kim that her role on the show would be at risk if she didn't get help that she needed. 'The . pressures the women face being on the show are enormous. Kim was . basically told that if she wanted to stay on the show then she had to . get help, so she did' the source told RadarOnline.com. Out of the picture: Kim is reportedly homeless, after her plans to move in with boyfriend Ken Blumenfeld fell through . 'Kim doesn’t have any other significant source of income and she needs to keep her job on the show.' Kim is also said to be homeless, with her plans to move in with her boyfriend Ken apparently falling through. During a recent episode of the Bravo show, Kim shocked her sister Kyle when she told her that she was planning to move in with Ken. But now it seems that she is back on her own. 'He's not in the picture. No one really knows what the deal was with them, but Kim doesn't live with Ken,' a source told People. 'She's basically homeless, staying . with various friends. She doesn't have a home base. It's not unusual for . people to not hear from her for long stretches of time. It's been that . way for years.' Back to rehab: It was reported yesterday that Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Kim had checked into rehab . Kim's family are said to be deeply relieved that she is now getting the help that she needs. 'Her family is relieved she's getting help,' the insider added. 'She has lots of issues. She needs help.' Reports that Kim had checked into rehab for a second time, emerged yesterday. Entertainment Tonight reported that Kim had entered an ‘undisclosed treatment facility’. A spokesperson for the reality star was unavailable for comment. Kim has faced accusations that she is an alcoholic from her sister Kyle on the reality show last season and she was accused of taking crystal meth by new recruit Brandi Glandville this series, the video of which is below. The former Disney star’s behaviour has certainly been erratic on the show and viewers have seen her slurring her words on a number of occasions. Glamour girls: Kim, far right, seen with her Real Housewives co-stars Kyle, Taylor and Lisa . Yet in one episode aired last month Dr Paul Nassif told Kim her problematic speech was down to the combination of prescription drugs she was taking. Her co-star and sister Kyle made no comment of the news on her Twitter account yesterday but was posting messages about other things earlier in the day. While viewers of the reality show have seen Kim's co-stars worry about her health, her sister has also shown concern over Ken. Kyle made her feelings about Ken Blumenfeld, who was arrested in 2009 for driving under the influence, quite clear and burst into tears on the show. She said she didn't think the 46-year-old businessman, who has been seeing Kim for a year, was 'right' for her sister.",Concerned Bravo bosses also urged Kim into rehab following the recent suicide of Taylor Armstrong's husband Russell .

Poyet believes he can reinvigorate the career of Rodwell, who was tipped for greatness by Everton coaches when he was just 12. ‘He was light years ahead of anyone in his age group,’ said one source close to Rodwell, whose life in football could have begun very differently had a certain club across Stanley Park shared the glowing view of the midfielder who was invited to a trial at  Liverpool as a six-year-old. However Anfield talent-spotters couldn’t quite see what all the fuss was about and they gave Rodwell, who can also play as a central defender, a small trophy to help soften the blow of his rejection. He was quickly enrolled at Everton and it didn’t take long before the club knew they had someone special on their hands. David Moyes didn’t need any convincing either, handing Rodwell his senior debut at the age of 16 in a UEFA Cup tie against AZ Alkmaar in 2007. Just five years earlier Moyes had handed another 16-year-old his debut. But those close to Moyes claim the Scot was far more excited about the emergence of Rodwell than he was Wayne Rooney. Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson agonised over a move for Rodwell, but concluded that the youngster lacked the physical presence to compete for a first-team place. Stop-start: Rodwell has endured an up-and-down few years on the domestic and international stage . Likewise, upon joining Real Madrid in 2010, Jose Mourinho told scouts to monitor Rodwell’s performances at Everton. But little did Mourinho know that Bernabeu scouts were already doing just that. It seemed nothing was going to stop the kid from Southport. But no-one could foresee the injury woes that were just round the corner, with persistent hamstring problems restricting Rodwell to just 19 appearances — two of which came for England — during the 2011-12 season. Yet that didn’t stop Roberto Mancini splashing £12m on the youngster in August 2012. The Italian had high hopes for Rodwell at City, but the Englishman made just 10 starts for the club in two seasons, due, in part, to his problematic hamstrings. Those who have studied Rodwell’s injury concerns feel they are partly due to deficiencies in his body alignment rather than a weakness of his leg muscles. At 23, Rodwell still has time on his side. But he knows he can ill-afford another hamstrung season.","The 23-year-old has completed a £7million move to Sunderland .

"By . Ruth Styles . She was a promising film-maker on the verge of a stellar career. But rather than pursuing her Hollywood dream, Donna Hanssen chose to turn her back on the big time for a life on conservation's front line. Outraged by figures that revealed Namibia's carnivore population had halved during the 1980s, she and her siblings launched AfriCat - a pioneering organisation that has saved more than 1,000 lions, leopards and cheetahs since 1993. But, says the veteran conservationist, while numbers are picking up, the animals are still under threat - both from poachers and from farmers who shoot the animals as they move across their land for fear of what might happen to their cows if they don't. Scroll down for video . Hard at work: Donna Hanssen turned her back on a promising film career to dedicate her life to protecting Namibia's endangered lions, leopards and cheetahs . Beautiful: One of the rescued leopards living at the Okonjima Wildlife Reserve tucks into his lunch while perching precariously on a branch . Shocking: A leopard lies beaten and bloody after being killed by angry villagers (left) and right, a jubilant group of villagers show off a lion they have killed . 'What I love about big cats is their survival instinct, their independence, their patience and their beauty,' smiles Donna.'They're so essential for keeping the balance and they mostly take out the weak and the old, so that the strong are left to breed.' As in other African countries, Namibia's big cats are coming under increasing pressure from human farmers and, although not to the same extent as rhinos and elephants, are also threatened by poaching. Currently, the country is home to an estimated 6,000 cheetahs, 4,000 leopards and around 600 lions, while the number of African Wild Dogs - a species particularly loathed because of their vicious habit of ripping chunks of flesh out of living animals - is unknown but thought to be low. Most of those rescued by the AfriCat Foundation are the victims of traps and snares; some of which leave the animal so injured, it can never be released back into the wild. For the lucky ones, rescue means being given a new life in Etosha National Park, a stretch of wilderness in northern Namibia that covers 8,600sqm chunk of savannah and salt pan. New life: For the luckier animals rescued by Donna and her team, a new life at the gorgeous Etosha National Park in northern Namibia beckons . Healthy: Big cats, such as those relocated to Etosha by Donna and her team, help keep the springbok population in check and ensure only the strong breed . Safe: Etosha, one of the world's largest reserves, has been a haven for wildlife since 1907, when it was established by the German colonial authorities . The Africat Foundation is partially funded by guests staying at Okonjima Lodge. Exotic Travel and Safaris, which offers a 12-day tour that includes a night at the lodge and a chance to meet the animals at the reserve. Packages include accommodation, meals and transfers, with prices starting at £1,874 per person. For more information, see exotictravelsafaris.com . South African Airways offers return flights to Windhoek from London Heathrow via Johannesburg from £1,010. See flysaa.com for more. For further information on Namibia, please visit namibiatourism.com.na . For more on Africat, see africat.org . Those who can't be released go instead to the Okonjima Nature Reserve, a small stretch of land nestled among the Omboroko Mountains, which along with a small lodge, houses the AfriCat Foundation itself. From Okonjima, Donna and her colleagues run a programme that encompasses the whole of Namibia and combines rescuing trapped wildlife with educating farmers and schoolchildren - much of it paid for using the proceeds of the on-site safari lodge. 'The secret to conservation is habitat,' explains Donna. 'If you've got the space, animals make it, they survive. But we're also . dealing with farmers that have to survive. 'They have to farm with . leopards, cheetahs, elephants, spotted hyenas and brown hyenas and wild . dogs whereas a farmer in Europe might at the most have to deal with a wolf of a bear. Or if they're in the UK, a fox. 'What we do is say to the farmer, ""Take a week to come in Okonjima and we will show you how to keep the cattle safe without using traps or shooting the wildlife"". We're trying to change their minds and methods - that's conservation.' But while many have embraced the reforms championed by Donna and her team, others continue to take a harsher stance on dealing with wildlife - much to Donna's distress. 'The ugliest thing is the cruelty and the . greed,' she says, sadly. 'To destroy nature as much as you can just for the benefit of your own pocket - . just so you can make as much money as you can.' But that's not all. 'Cruelty is often a combination of . ignorance and fear,' she continues. 'So people do horrible things to animals because they . fear them, or because they don't realise, or ignore, the fact that animals get stressed. 'I've seen farmers keeping cheetahs in . tiny cages in the baking, 50°C summer heat just to punish it for killing . his calf. And then there's a new type of poaching, where people kill . mothers just to take the babies and raise them like they saved them. Then, when they grow up, they sell them to hunting farms to be shot for . money.' Under threat: African Wild Dogs are increasingly endangered thanks to farmers who loathe them for their cruel method of killing their prey . Tracking: A team from Okonjima hunt for one of the cheetahs living onto the property. All are given electronic tags before being released . Relaxed: One of the tagged cheetahs at Okonjima relaxes in a patch of long grass after tucking into a springbok supper . Getting angry, she adds: 'It . should be classified alongside human trafficking and illegal arms trafficking. Poaching needs to be attacked by a government level. We . can't fight that battle. Farmers earn so much money passing on trapped animals to the . poachers, it's impossible for us to fight.' And it's not just the big cats that suffer appalling cruelty. Whipping out a sheaf of photos, Donna runs through some of the other horrors she and her team have come across. One shows a . baby pangolin being turned into soup ('a cultural problem' says Donna), . a truly ghastly image of a pair of horses being worked into exhaustion . by two children and kicked when they fall over, an elephant lying . bloated and tusk-less after being mutilated by poachers and a snap of . two adult lions dead and bloody in a trap. Clearly, . there is much for Donna and her team to do. For all that, she remains . hopeful about the future and says she hopes that one day, people will . give Africa's wildlife the respect and protection it deserves. 'In . all the years that we've been doing this, we've managed to talk to . around five per cent of farmers. If we have managed to change the minds . of just that five per cent, then we're already happy. 'But . hopefully, with the rise of the internet, more people will find out . about what's going on and fewer animals will be shot. Hopefully the next . generation of farmers will realise that killing isn't fun and that it . certainly isn't a solution to their problems.' Education: One part of Donna's job involves teaching local children and farmers to appreciate the big cats with whom they share their lives . Long road: Although Donna and AfriCat have enjoyed some spectacular successes, she says there is still a very long way to go . Tiny: Jackals are also helped by AfriCat but suffer less at the hands of farmers, who don't see them as a huge threat to their livestock .

But just hours later Bethenny Frankel appeared to be in much better spirits. The 43-year-old former talk show host kept a brave face as she strolled down the street with her adorable four-year-old daughter Bryn in Manhattan. Back to mommy duty: Bethenny Frankel sported a brave face with daughter Bryn hours after her bitter court battle with estranged husband Jason Hoppy . Bethenny beamed in a pink top, distressed denim jeans and a pair of flip flops while pushing her bundle of joy in a stroller. She wore her dark tresses down past her shoulders with little make-up and a pair of dark sunglasses which hid her eyes that hours earlier were reportedly covered in tears as she plead her case on the witness stand. With obviously much on her mind, the SkinnyGirl mogul kept quite busy by checking her smartphone while picking up Bryn from daycare. Bitter court battle: The 43-year-old wore a pink top, distressed jeans and flip flops as she picked up her daughter from daycare . A lot on her mind: Despite her legal troubles, she appeared to be in much better spirits . The battle between Bethenny and her ex Jason Hoppy for custody of their daughter is shaping up to be incredibly nasty. On Wednesday the attorney for the 43-year-old reality star accused her 42-year-old estranged spouse of hacking into her personal email and 'sought to obsessively control her every move through their daughter,' according to a report from PageSix. The allegations were made during opening statements in a New York City courtroom. Scroll down for video . Bitter split: Bethenny Frankel leaves Manhattan's Family Court on Wednesday accompanied by her lawyers . Battle for Bryn: Jason Hoppy looked down on Wednesday when he arrived at a New York City courthouse for a child custody battle with estranged wife Bethenny Frankel . Frankel has hired lawyer Allan Mayefsky, who represented Katie Holmes in her split from Tom Cruise. Mayefsky claimed the Bravo star's husband went 'to war' once their union crumbled in 2012. 'He threatened to destroy her,' Frankel's attorney said. 'He had her followed and spied on along with their daughter. He hacked into her most private personal email.' ​'​He has . consciously placed his desire for revenge … over the best interests of . this family and particularly the child,' Mayefsky concluded.​ ​'He has . sought to obsessively control their every move through their daughte​r.' She means business: Bethenny refused to settle out of court (pictured at court on May 28) Mayefsky said his client is a 'very, very involved mother' whose success will benefit the child. While Bethenny is insisting on primary custody and sole decision-making authority for Bryn, Jason ​is asking for shared custody. While under . attack, Jason showed no emotion. His attorney Bernard Clair, who has . also repped Simon Cowell's baby mother Lauren Silverman, also accused . the Skinnygirl businesswoman of wanting to get even. One . of the examples mentioned was how Bethenny allegedly stripped their . shared condo on Hudson Street when she vacated it earlier this year. 'The clothes were gone, the favorite stuffed animals gone, the favorite dollhouse gone,' Clair said. Real . love: Bethenny and Jason enjoyed a break in St. Barts after tying the . knot in March, 2010, two months before Brynn's birth. The happy time was . captured in Bravo reality show, Bethenny Getting Married . He argued . the change made Bryn upset. When her father went to cook her a meal to . calm her nerves, he said the kitchen was almost empty. 'He . found that every single utensil had been taken but replaced with . plastic knives, forks and spoons like you would pick up from a takeout . place. One pot was left,' Clair said. According to Clair, Bethenny removed all the personal belongings from the home in order to 'relegate the father of her child to a walking sperm bank.' Clair . also said Frankel used 'the child as a prop … in the pursuit of her own . career and her own brand.' He said she 'embarked on a secret endeavor . to have a children’s book published' this coming September about Bryn’s . life. 'Ms. Frankel even arranged for the illustrator to come to her home to follow . this child around so that every likeness and every sense of the child . could be presented,' Clair said. 'And that’s not all: This children’s . book has the Skinnygirl logo, Skinnygirl being the brand of Ms. Frankel, . throughout its pages.' Once a close family: Bethenny and Jason with daughter Bryn and their dog in April 2012 . According to RadarOnline, Bethenny was in 'tears' while on the stand, claiming her estranged husband said she was 'disgusting.' 'If you don’t want to be with me and you’re ending this marriage, I want nothing to do with you ever again. I’m going to destroy you. I'm going to have you and your publicist crying and crumbling in a corner,' she revealed Hoppy had told her. She added that Jason said, 'You’re already losing fans. I’m going to ruin you' and also saying, 'You’re dead to me. I want nothing to do with you. You think I want to be with you on the holidays? You’re a piece of s—. You’re garbage. You have no idea what I’ve got on you.' The former Real Housewives of New York City star claims Jason's behavior got even nastier around the house. According to Bethenny, following their split her estranged husband 'would pee and poop and leave it in the toilet.' During story time with his daughter, Hoppy would allegedly say things to Bryn like, 'Mommy should be the witch. She's a great witch. You'll be the princess and I'll be the prince,' said Frankel. She claims he even altered Bryn's strictly vegetarian diet by allegedly feeding their daughter 'hot dogs, bacon and fried chicken' without discussing it with Bethenny. Not the best year: The entrepreneur, pictured in New York City on April 23, has seen her daytime talk show canceled and has been dealing with her divorce proceedings . The couple are also sparring over religion as Frankel claimed they agreed to baptize their daughter at Jason's parents' request but did not plan to raise Brynn in the Catholic faith, reported People. 'That and going [to church] on high holidays was the extent of Bryn's religion,' she said. But she claims he has broken his agreement and started taken the four-year-old to church without her consent. Bethenny filed for divorce from Jason 16 months ago. Jason had . reportedly been hoping to come to an out-of-court deal with his . estranged wife, who sold her Skinnygirl alcohol brand to Beam Global for . an estimated $39m with a similar amount promised if the brand hit . certain sales targets. A source told People, 'She wanted to settle out of court but some of his demands were absolutely insane that no mother would ever agree.' Bethenny and Jason are due back in court on June 11. No, she's mine: Jason, 42, is equally adamant about his custody right to Bryn as the couple's bitter divorce wrangle comes to a head after 16 months . In June 2010, the celebrity starred in the Bravo reality TV show Bethenny Getting Married, which documented her engagement to Jason, their marriage on March 28, 2010, and the birth of their daughter two months later. The brunette, whose show Bethenny was cancelled by Fox after just one season, is finding solace in the arms of her new beau, Michael Cerrusi. She has been dating the beefy 34-year-old son of a prominent New York attorney since the beginning of the year.

"By . Nick Enoch . As ramshackle houses sit in the bleak snowy wasteland of Siberia - frozen clothes laid out across fenceposts - a train comes to a stop in plain sight. For the townsfolk of Kun ('Valley of snow'), comprising only a handful of families who have no running water, the train is their lifeline. But this is no ordinary transportation. It is the Matvei Mudrov medical facility. These stunning pictures of the mobile GP surgery, as it travels from village to village, were taken by William Daniels for National Geographic magazine. The Matvei Mudrov train - a mobile GP surgery - pulls into Kun, a remote village in the far east of Russia. For the handful of villagers who live in the ramshackle settlement, it is the closest they'll ever get to professional healthcare . The facility is not equipped to carry out even basic surgery but its strengths lie in diagnosis - it has heart monitors, ultrasound and x-ray machines - as well as recommendations for treatment. Above, staff take an after-hours break in the frozen wastelands of Siberia . Operated by the Russian state railways agency, the Matvei Mudrov has around 15 doctors, examination rooms and basic medical equipment. Above, two staffers celebrate the birthday of medical director Vera Scherbakova. In the background is a portrait of Matvei Mudrov, a pioneering 19th-century physician who is the train's namesake .

The images are from the June issue of National Geographic magazine . And there is a lab which can analyse urine and blood samples. Patients also have access to a neurologist, Alexander Komarov, who became a doctor in the 1980s. Among those who have come for advice is Mikhail Zdanovich, a 61-year-old repairman who dislocated his shoulder three years ago at the rail depot where he worked. Hailing from the town of Berkakit (population 4,500), further up the line, he has his right arm in a sling. Zdanovich has an appointment booked at a surgery - months away - in Khabarovsk, 1,000 miles from his home. But wants to know now whether he can continue to work. Another man, from Khani (population: 742), fell down some stairs and has broken both ankles. Most of the consultations take place onboard, but doctors do occasionally make house calls. It is the closest many of the villagers in isolated parts of eastern Russia will get to professional healthcare. Conditions in the region are harsh: in winter, temperatures can drop to as low as -45C, and there are few roads. Built in . the late 1970s, the Matvei Mudrov runs along the Baikal-Amur Mainline .

"By . Mark Prigg . Researchers have revealed a patient was turned into a Johnny Cash fan after an implant was put into his brain. 'Mr. B', a 60 year old Dutch man who had suffered from severe obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and anxiety since the age of 13. Following a successful implant to treat the symptoms, doctors were stunned to find he had become a huge Johnny Cash fan after hearing the song Ring of Fire. Following a successful implant to treat the symptoms, a dutch 60 year old told doctors he had become a huge Johnny Cash fan after hearing the song Ring of Fire. Before the implant, Mr B's musical taste was broad, covering Dutch-language songs, the Beatles and his favourite band, the Rolling Stones. Following the implant, he had been listening to the radio, when he heard 'Ring of Fire' of the Country and was deeply affected by the song. 'Mr. B. started to listen to more songs of Johnny Cash and noticed that he was deeply moved by the raw and low-pitched voice of the singe,' the team said. 'Moreover, he experienced that he preferred the performance of the songs in the Seventies and Eighties, due to the fullness of the voice of the older Johnny Cash in that period. 'His favorite songs, 'Folsom prison blues', 'Ring of fire' and 'Sunday morning coming down' had a certain rhythm with a fast tempo in common that moved him.' The authors, Mariska Mantione and colleagues, said the unnamed man had suffered from severe obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and anxiety since the age of 13. Medications and psychotherapy had failed to help, so he was given deep brain stimulation (DBS) as a last resort treatment. 'Our patient reported that after DBS he was grasped in particular by the rhythm of Johnny Cash songs and by the tone of his voice,' the team said. The electrodes were placed in the nucleus accumbens region of the brain. Mr. B. reported he felt very confident, calm and assertive and he started to call himself 'Mr. B. II', the new and improved version of himself. 'It could be suggested that the image he creates when listening to songs of Johnny Cash seems to match his 'new' confident self,' the researchers wrote. Before the implant, Mr B's musical taste was broad, covering Dutch-language songs, the Beatles and his favourite band, the Rolling Stones. However, after it, he said those bands were 'banned' and only listened to Johnny Cash . 'Like Mr. B. states: 'it seems as if Johnny Cash goes together with DBS.' The team also found the change is taste was directly linked to the implant. 'Moreover, his former musical taste reoccurred immediately when stimulation was interrupted due to battery depletion, suggesting a direct causal link between musical preference and stimulation of the accumbens. ' Interviews also revealed that before the implant, the man had little interest in music. 'Mr. B., had never been a huge music lover,' they wrote. 'His musical taste was broad, covering Dutch-language songs, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, with a preference for the last named. 'While music did not occupy an important position in his live, his taste in music had always been very fixed and his preferences stayed the same throughout decades.' After undergoing the surgery, 12 months later the patient admitted his new musical taste. 'He had been listening to the radio, when he coincidentally heard 'Ring of Fire' of the Country and Western singer and experienced that he was deeply affected by the song. 'Mr. B. started to listen to more songs of Johnny Cash and noticed that he was deeply moved by the raw and low-pitched voice of the singer. 'Moreover, he experienced that he preferred the performance of the songs in the Seventies and Eighties, due to the fullness of the voice of the older Johnny Cash in that period. Banned: The Beatles were also a pre-operation favourite of Mr B - but he can no longer enjoy them . 'His favorite songs, 'Folsom prison blues', 'Ring of fire' and 'Sunday morning coming down' had a certain rhythm with a fast tempo in common that moved him. 'Mr. B. reported that he felt good following treatment with DBS and that the songs of Johnny Cash made him feel even better. 'From this moment on, Mr. B. kept listening simply and solely to Johnny Cash and bought all his CD’s and DVD’s. 'When listening to his favorite songs he walks back and forth through the room and feels like he finds himself in a movie in which he plays the hero’s part. 'He reports that there is a Johnny Cash song for every emotion and every situation, feeling happy or feeling sad and although Mr. B. played almost simply and solely Johnny Cash songs for the following years, the music never starts to annoy him. 'From the first time Mr. B. heard a Johnny Cash song, the Dutch-language songs, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones have been banned.

Peter Breen became the second staffer in less than a week to be dumped by Senator Muir, who last Thursday also dismissed his chief adviser Glenn Druery.

Scroll down for video . Ricky Muir's sacked political adviser Peter Breen worries the rookie Victorian senator will struggle without an experienced team around him . Far from being angry, Mr Breen laments no longer working for the Senate newcomer and is concerned his 'inexperienced' former boss faces an uphill battle without seasoned advisers by his side. Mr Breen said Mr Muir can't do it on his own and needs an experienced team around him . 'I just think the advice he's getting at the moment is not as good as it could be,' he told ABC radio on Wednesday. 'You really can't do it on your own. Ricky just needs all the help he can get.' Mr Breen claims he was having surgery on the day he was accused of taking sick leave but says he did also attend the Byron Bay Writers Festival. But he denies any part in leaking allegations of undermining and backstabbing within Senator Muir's staff, pointing the finger squarely at Mr Druery. Mr Breen confirmed he made an 'incident report' to parliament about ruptures between Mr Druery and the Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party founder Keith Littler but didn't go public with the details. 'Unfortunately that was leaked to the press and that caused him (Senator Muir) a lot of grief,' Mr Breen said. Known as the 'preference whisperer' for his role in getting micro-parties elected, Mr Druery has not commented on why his employment was cut short. Mr Breen said his short stint with Senator Muir was exciting, praising his style as an 'ordinary' man representing real interests and people.

Coral's current favourite to win Bake Off at 3/1 is grandmother of eight, Nancy Birtwhisle . The keen baker, 60, from Barton-Upon-Humber, whipped up her incredible cake using a recipe that put even McVitie's to . shame. It consisted of 'vanilla sponge, sandwiched with Cointreau orange jelly topped . with dark chocolate, and handmade orange pastilles.' She even used a homemade cake guillotine to ensure precise symmetry. The former practice manager at Central Surgery in Barton discovered a passion for baking after retiring seven years ago. She was selected as a contestant for this year's series after a failed application last year, and is one of 12 amateurs looking to impress judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood. Nancy Birtwhisle who took the prized title of Star Baker for her 'Jaffa cakes' yesterday . She is one of 12 amateurs looking to impress judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood . Hot on her heels to win the baking contest, which has moved from BBC2 to BBC1, is Richard the builder at 7/2. Youngest contestant ever at just 17, Martha Collison is next with odds of 5/1. Meanwhile, poor Claire Goodwin was the first to exit, Coral now have the colourfully attired Jordan Cox at 5/4 as the next baker to leave as he failed to impress the judges. It wouldn't be a Bake Off without tears and tantrums and following the debut episode, Coral is offering odds of 2/1 of at least three contestants welling up by the third episode. Although it's the baking disaster cake lovers fear the most, the phrase 'soggy bottom' comes a close second. It was used in jest last night but Coral offers odds at 7/4 that it will be used to describe a contestant's creation by the third episode. Dressed in a splendid floral design for episode one, It's odds on at 1/2 that Mary Berry will sport a floral blazer at least four times throughout the series. Coral's John Hill says: 'The new series, although predictable, continues to receive rave reviews and shows no signs of falling flat, promising the usual helping of one-liners from Mel and Sue and dollops of innuendo from Paul and Mary, but all eyes will be on the contestants' clever creations over the coming weeks.

With the likes of Kim Kardashian and Miranda Kerr constantly parading their perfect posteriors on social media, it comes as little surprise that body conscious beach-goers are spending nearly $500 (£300) on a new treatment that promises to enhance their derrieres. Make way for the 'butt facial' - the latest beauty craze to come out of New York. The costly 40-minute procedure uses lasers, chemical peels and moisturisers to tone and smooth the skin. Judith Liriano, 21, had the procedure done to rid her bottom of cellulite, dimples, and dark spots and she couldn't be happier with the results. Scroll down for video . Would you pay that much? Judith Liriano poses at the beach after getting her £300 butt facial - a new treatment that promises to enhance your bottom . Speaking about the treatment, Judith said: 'Every girl wants to feel confident when they're on the beach - before I tried the booty facial, I wasn't as confident as I am now. I don't think you could put a price tag on looking good and feeling good. 'I feel great, I love the results - my butt looks better, it's has an even colour, is more toned, and feels so much firmer than it did before.' The procedure, named the 'Tip Top Tush Treatment' is available at Dr. Matthew Schulman's plastic surgery office in New York City. First, a special exfoliating scrub is massaged onto the bottom to rid it of dead skin. Then a laser treatment with radio frequency follows, smoothing and contouring the skin before a special firming moisturiser is applied when the laser is finished. Before and after: Judith had the treatment, which involves a special exfoliating scrub being massaged onto the bottom to rid it of dead skin, before a laser treatment with radio frequency follows . Procedure: Judith Liriano gets a chemical peel from Amanda Sanzone as part of getting her $500 (£300) butt facial . Aesthetician Amanda Sanzone performs the procedure and says it is becoming increasingly popular among New Yorkers. Amanda said: 'The butt facial has become a lot more popular recently - we treat the skin on our faces, we treat the skin on our necks, our hands. 'But especially with summer here and bikini season here, a lot of women, and sometimes even men, want to treat the skin on their butts. It was worth it then! Speaking after her procedure, Judith said: 'I feel great, I love the results - my butt looks better, it's has an even colour, is more toned, and feels so much firmer than it did before' Ready for the beach: Judith joins hundreds of body conscious beach-goers who are spending hundreds of pounds to have the treatment . Will it catch on? Esthetician Amanda Sanzone performs the procedure and says it is becoming increasingly popular among New Yorkers because it helps boost their confidence . 'In today's culture, people are taking more pictures and taking group shots and noticing problems on their butt or thighs that they never noticed before. 'This treatment is very important - a lot of people are self conscious about the skin on their butts. 'Whether it's acne or cellulite, it's definitely a treatment that can help boost self-confidence and make you feel really comfortable in a bikini.' Amanda said one can expect the best results after three to six treatments depending on skin type. Showing off the results: The people behind the new treatment believe that in today's culture, people are taking more pictures and taking group shots and noticing problems on their butt or thighs that they never noticed before . Priceless: Judith said: 'Every girl wants to feel confident when they're on the beach - before I tried the booty facial, I wasn't as confident as I am now. I don't think you could put a price tag on looking good and feeling good' The treatment is slowly seeping its way into the UK with EF MEDISPA in London offering the treatment. Esther Fieldgrass, who owns the spa, . said: ‘As they spend the majority of the year hidden away in clothes, . our bottoms don't get the care and attention they deserve, with many of . us often neglecting this area from our skincare routine altogether. ‘Combine . this with desk jobs, tight underwear that causes friction and traps . sweat against the skin, and tiny hair follicles which can become . blocked, and you have the perfect recipe for a spotty bottom.’ Is it all her fault?

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . A comet hurtling towards Mars is set to put three Nasa spacecraft at risk. Nasa is taking steps to protect its Mars orbiters, while preserving opportunities to gather valuable scientific data, as Comet C/2013 A1 Siding Spring heads toward a close flyby on 19 October. While the comet itself poses little danger, debris that is travelling in its wake could pose a problem if any spacecraft pass through its tail. Nasa is taking steps to protect three spacecraft that will be in orbit around Mars when Comet Sliding Spring makes a pass by the planet on 19 October (illustration shown). The comet will miss Mars by about 82,000 miles (132,000 kilometers), and its trail of dust particles could pose a threat to the three probes . The comet's nucleus will miss Mars by about 82,000 miles (132,000 kilometers), shedding material hurtling at about 35 miles (56 kilometers) per second relative to Mars and Mars-orbiting spacecraft. Despite posing a threat, this event also poses a rare opportunity to study an interesting comet. In the days before and after the comet's flyby, Nasa will study the comet by taking advantage of how close it comes to Mars. Researchers plan to use several instruments on the Mars orbiters to study the nucleus, the coma surrounding the nucleus, and the tail of Siding Spring, as well as the possible effects on the Martian atmosphere. This particular comet has never before entered the inner solar system, so it will provide a fresh source of clues to our solar system's earliest days. Maven will study gases coming off the comet's nucleus into its coma as it is warmed by the sun, and it will also look for effects the comet flyby may have on the planet's upper atmosphere and observe the comet as it travels through the solar wind. Odyssey will study thermal and spectral properties of the comet's coma and tail. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) will monitor Mars' atmosphere for possible temperature increases and cloud formation, as well as changes in electron density at high altitudes. The MRO team also plans to study gases in the comet's coma. Along with other MRO observations, the team anticipates this event will yield detailed views of the comet's nucleus and potentially reveal its rotation rate and surface features. At that velocity, even the smallest particle - estimated to be about 0.02 inches (0.5 millimetres) across - could cause significant damage to a spacecraft. Nasa currently operates two Mars orbiters, with a third on its way and expected to arrive in Martian orbit just a month before the comet flyby. Teams operating the orbiters plan to have all spacecraft positioned on the opposite side of the Red Planet when the comet is most likely to pass by. 'Three expert teams have modeled this comet for Nasa and provided forecasts for its flyby of Mars,' explained Dr Richard Zurek, chief scientist for the Mars Exploration Program at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. 'The hazard is not an impact of the comet nucleus, but the trail of debris coming from it. 'Using constraints provided by Earth-based observations, the modeling results indicate that the hazard is not as great as first anticipated. 'Mars will be right at the edge of the debris cloud, so it might encounter some of the particles - or it might not.' During the day's events, the smallest distance between Siding Spring's nucleus and Mars will be less than one-tenth the distance of any known previous Earthly comet flyby. The period of greatest risk to orbiting spacecraft will start about 90 minutes later and last about 20 minutes, when Mars will come closest to the center of the widening dust trail from the nucleus. Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) made one orbit-adjustment manoeuvre on 2 July as part of the process of re-positioning the spacecraft for the 19 October event. An additional manoeuvre is planned for 27 August. The team operating Nasa's Mars Odyssey orbiter, meanwhile, is planning a similar manoeuvre on 5 August to get their spacecraft out of harm's way. Nasa's Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (Maven) spacecraft, meanwhile, is on its way to the Red Planet and will enter orbit on 21 September. Nasa's Maven orbiter (illustration shown) is due to join the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Mars Odyssey in orbit around the Red Planet on 21 September. The team running the probe are already preparing a manoeuvre to ensure the spacecraft is not damaged by the incoming Comet Sliding Spring . The Maven team is planning to conduct a precautionary manoeuvre on 9 October, prior to the start of the mission's main science phase in early November. Of course there won't just be operational spacecraft in orbit around Mars when the comet approaches; two active rovers are also on the surface. However Mars' atmosphere, though much thinner than Earth's, is thick enough that Nasa does not anticipate any hazard to the Opportunity and Curiosity rovers on the planet's surface, even if dust particles from the comet hit the atmosphere and form into meteors. Rover cameras may be used to observe the comet before the flyby, and to monitor the atmosphere for meteors while the comet's dust trail is closest to the planet. Observations from Earth-based and space telescopes provided data used for modeling to make predictions about Siding Spring's Mars flyby, which were in turn used for planning protective manoeuvres.","Nasa scientists in California are taking action to save probes from a comet .
Three spacecraft will be orbiting Mars when the comet passes on 19 October .
Known as Comet C/2013 A1 Sliding Spring the main danger is from its tail .
This contains many pieces of debris that could damage Nasa's spacecraft .
So the agency is taking steps to position the probes so that they will avoid it .
The debris is moving at 35 miles per second and would cause significant damage if it hit one of the spacecraft .

"By . Inderdeep Bains . The driver of a Porsche that careered into a broken down car killing the woman inside has been arrested, police said today. Drivers looked on in horror as the woman victim burned to death inside her blue Nissan Almera after it was catapulted 150ft along the M40 and then burst into flames. Moments earlier the powerful Porsche Cayenne 4x4 had ploughed into the tiny car that was stranded on the M40 in Buckinghamshire yesterday morning just before 10am.  Firefighters battled to free her from the inferno but she was later confirmed dead. Full details of how the smash happened are yet to emerge but police have arrested the 47-year-old male driver of the Porsche on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. They said the woman victim was from Birmingham and her family have been told of the accident. Burning inferno: The car burst into flames, trapping the female driver inside after a Porsche Cayenne crashed into the back of her car . Impact: The car was catapulted 50 metres along the M40 leaving a trail of debris before it burst into flames . The pensioner is believed to have been slowing to a stop moments before the collision with the Porsche travelling a short distance behind her. One onlooker said: 'The car was just a blackened wreck, and it would have been hard to survive that. 'It was a scene of devastation and it's just sad to know someone lost their life.' Another wrote on Twitter: 'Big big accident on the M40 back to London. Fatal someone got burned alive.' It took 20 firefighters to put out the blaze, with a screen being erected around the mangled car to shield motorists' view as the victim's remains were removed from the vehicle. All four lanes of the M40 southbound between junctions three and two in Beaconsfield were closed as a result of the accident. A Thames Valley Police spokesman said officers would need to use dental records to identify the badly-burned body. The Buckinghamshire Coroner's office . told the Mail Online that they are still formally identifying the . pensioner and that her name will be released once that is complete. The victim, who was travelling alone, . appeared to have broken down on the southbound carriageway near . Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, at about 10am. Her car slowed to a stop . in the middle lane and was struck by a Porsche Cayenne. Police said the second car's driver, a 47-year-old man, was taken to hospital for treatment to minor injuries. Shocking shell: Motorists could only watch helplessly as the victim's car was engulfed in an inferno and left totally destroyed . Screening the wreck: Fire fighters erected screens to remove the woman's charred remains while the Porsche remained with minor damage (right) What's left: The burned out shell of the victim's car was collected (top left) before the Porsche (bottom left) as rescue crews tried to clear the road quickly . 'He has since been released by medics . and has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous . driving,' a spokesman confirmed. Screens were put up in front of the . wrecked Nissan by firemen to shield the view of other drivers as they . extracted the woman's remains. All four lanes of the M40 southbound . between junctions 2 and 3 were closed as a result of the crash, causing . major delays. The route was not partially reopened until 4pm. Bumper to bumper: The four southbound lanes of the M40 were closed as a result, causing major delays for motorists heading towards London . Thames Valley Police issued an appeal for information relating to the collision yesterday. A spokesman said: 'Officers would . like to hear from anyone who witnessed this incident as well as the . driving of the car before it broke down on the motorway.' Campaigners last month called for an . overhaul of safety policies following a rise in deaths on the roads for . the first time in eight years. The number of road fatalities increased by 3 per cent to 1,901 last year – the first annual rise since 2003. The overall number of people killed or seriously injured rose for the first time since 1994 to 25,023. Road safety experts said the . Government's promise to 'end the war on motorists' should bear some of . the blame, as cuts to police, road safety budgets and speed cameras came . into effect.","The victim was a 73-year-old woman from Birmingham who had broken down on motorway .

"By . Deni Kirkova . Kitty Hope and Mark Greenwood have been making traditional British treats with a twist - think Sicilian lemon curd coconut ice, candy floss boiled sweets and chilli and ginger ticklers - for eight years and now the pair are set to teach the British public to do the same via their first TV show. The couple already have two renowned sweet shops in London, several more in Japan, run a busy mail-order website and sell their sweets in supermarkets, department stores and smart delicatessens. The couple from London are now set to realise their other big dream: to demystify sweet-making and get all of us whipping up gingerbread latte fudge in our homes. Kitty and Mark - world famous London confectioners - launch their first show, Sweets Made Simple . The new four-part series, called Sweets Made Simple, is tipped to be the biggest since the Great British Bake Off. Starting on Friday on BBC Two, the show sees the fun-loving couple put on the rubber gloves, pull out the heavy-bottomed pans and strain, squeeze, shape and lovingly craft their confections - showing you just how it's done, step-by-step. Their passion for sweets is infectious - and they are pretty keen on each other too. 'We met 20 years ago at a friend's dinner party, there was Boursin and a hostess trolley, and that was that,' says Kitty. 'Two decades later and we have two award-winning shops in London, lots of shops all over Japan, four recipe books and a TV series with the biggest broadcaster in the country. We're still getting our heads around it.' A colourful and quirky display from Hope & Greenwood's store in London's Covent Garden . 'As a child who grew up in the north east of England. Sunday rituals included popping to the local sweet shop for Sarsaparilla's sweets, a Pink Panther bar and Twinkle Magazine. 'It's safe to say, I most definitely had a sweet tooth.' Despite being a keen cook since she was 18, Kitty led a very different life before setting up Hope & Greenwood with Mark. 'I worked as a creative manager for a design agency and Mr. G was an 18th century chimney piece specialist,' she says. 'I love being in the kitchen, nothing . excites me more than combining new flavours and tracking down new . ingredients, and confectionery was a part of that curiosity from a young . age. 'I had the idea to set up a sweet shop . ten years ago. Mark and I swapped our flash company cars and sensible salaries for a life without holidays. 'On our first day of opening our first shop, the till didn't work; we spent the first week trading out of a Quality Street tin. It's hard to believe that ten years later, we are about to have our very own TV show.' In the show, the couple will demonstrate how to recreate childhood favourites like Pulled Butter Toffee, Leather Roll-ups, Sherbet Dippers, Cinder Toffee and Turkish Delight . Sweets Made Simple is tipped to be the biggest thing since the Great British Bake Off, and starts on Friday . The sweet shop specialises in . old-fashioned favourites; retro sweets that conjures up a childhood nostalgia . When she set up shop in 2006, Kitty wanted to create a place where everything was exciting . and unique. And that ethos encompassed not just the products, but the decor. The shops are . 'Our sweet flavours are simply amazing, from Sicilian lemon curd, to coconut ice, to candy floss flavoured boiled sweets - we champion new food trends and pride ourselves on being innovative and original. 'Service is just as important to us as our products and the shops. We provide good old fashioned service. We know our customers' names, birthdays and favourite sweet. We will pat your dog and water your petunias.' In the show, the couple will demonstrate how to recreate childhood favourites such as pulled butter toffee, leather roll-ups, sherbet dippers, cinder toffee and Turkish delight. They will also showcase modern treats such as gin and lime truffles, Tequila chillies, salted seashell caramels and gingerbread latte fudge. The series sees them travelling across the UK as they seek out the best ingredients - from gin in Cambridge to the world's best butter in Country Antrim. Viewers will learn about the apothecaries of old at St Thomas's Herb Garret in London and take a trip down memory lane to Miss Hope's childhood sweet shop in Heaton, Newcastle. The central table in their Covent Garden store has a giant display of tempting sweet jars . 'When I got the email saying Sweets Made Simple had been commissioned I called Mr. G and said, ""There is good news and there is bad news… The good news is, Sweets Made Simple has been commissioned… The bad news is, you need to buy some Spanx"". 'I thought to myself, ""Why the heck has no one done this before?"" 'I think one of the things that puts people off making their own sweets is the fear that it's beyond them. They don't realise just how simple yet exciting it can be. We really hope that Sweets Made Simple shows them just how easy and satisfying it can be to concoct your own flavour combinations and experiment with a different type of cooking. We want people to love making sweets as much as we do. 'There are a million different recipes to be made, the possibilities are endless and it's a huge amount of fun. We're showing people how to make sweets on their kitchen table and demystifying the science.' Gingerbread latte fudge . Makes 49 splendid squares. Takes about 40 minutes to make, plus chilling. 'Every winter I look forward to the comfort and spice of a gingerbread latte so what better . than to take the whole exquisite experience and fold some old school . sticky ginger cake, cream and coffee into a smooth, yielding fudge with a . frothy latte topping? Every winter I also look forward to hot water . bottles, winceyette nighties and bed socks. Poor Mr Greenwood,' says Kitty.

"By . Snejana Farberov . A small town in Ohio has become the epicenter of an insect invasion of biblical proportions. Residents in the affluent Cleveland suburb of Rocky River awoke Wednesday morning to discover their cars, buildings and parking lots covered in a thick humming layer of mayflies. The critters, which also go by the name Canadian soldiers, do not bite and are not harmful, and luckily for those who live in Rocky River, they only live for a couple of days. Bugging out: Residents of a small town in Ohio awoke Wednesday to finds swarms of mayflies blanketing their homes and cars . Good sign: Experts say the presence of swarms of mayflies points to the fact that Lake Erie is healthy . The insects appear on the shores of Lake Erie each June in huge black swarms, and experts say their presence is a sign that the lake is healthy, according to Cleveland.com. While the bugs are large and can be a nuisance, people are urged not to kill them because they omit an unpleasant fishy odor when squashed. Mayflies are an important source of nutrition for many species, including a wide variety of fish and birds. Each year during early and mid-June, millions of mayflies hatch and sprout wings and then blanket street lamps, store windows, screen doors and just about anything they can cling to in cities such as Cleveland, Sandusky and Port Clinton and parts of the Toledo area. They’re an annoyance because they stick to clothes and sometimes land in hair. The mayfly population goes through cycles, said Don Schloesser, a researcher at the Great Lakes Science Center in Ann Arbor, Michigan. There were about 150 mayflies per square meter in 2012, while last year the density was half that, he told The Blade newspaper in Toledo. Pesky critters: Mayflies are large and annoying, but harmless, and people are advised not to kill them because they give off a fishy smell when squished . It’s not clear why there has been a change. The brutal winter and cool weather this spring could have delayed the emergence of the insects that survived. ‘If you don’t see them by the first week of July, you should kind of assume that they’re not coming this year,’ Schloesser said. Decaying algae that takes away oxygen in the lake might have caused the mayflies to suffocate, said Justin Chaffin, a research coordinator at Ohio State University’s Stone Laboratory. Workers in the city of Port Clinton are shutting off streetlights earlier so the bright lights don’t attract the insects. In many years, the swarms are so thick that business owners use leaf blowers to remove them from buildings and sidewalks. Unwelcome visitors: The swarms are often so thick that people use leaf blowers to remove them from buildings and sidewalks . Mayflies typically live for a day or two before dying. But the life cycle actually lasts two years. Mayflies begin as eggs on the water’s surface before the eggs sink to the bottom of the lake. The larvae hatch and burrow into the mud. Later, they wriggle out of their burrows and take off from the water. ‘We haven’t seen them in full force like we have in years past,’ said Blanca Stransky, superintendent of Perry’s Victory & International Peace Memorial on South Bass Island.","Millions of mayflies, also known as Canadian soldiers, descended on Cleveland suburb of Rocky River .

"By . Ryan Lipman For Daily Mail Australia . Maurice Blackburn lawyer Andrew Watson is fighting for customers to get the difference between charges for credit card late fees and the true cost to the bank . A multimillion-dollar payout could be handed to customers hit with excessive credit card fees in the biggest class action in Australian history. The class action to claw back excessive late payment charges of up to $35 could potentially impact hundreds of thousands of customers of Australia's biggest banks. Law firm Maurice Blackburn is filing lawsuits against ANZ, Westpac and Citibank in the NSW Supreme Court on Tuesday, reported the Sydney Morning Herald. The action is set to take in Westpac subsidiaries St George and BankSA. It is expected similar lawsuits against NAB, American Express, the Commonwealth Bank and subsidiary BankWest will follow, bringing the number of affected banks to nine. The action against the banks will see all of their customers who have been slugged with excessive late fees automatically included in the claim. This makes it hard to predict the potential payout amount although if successful it is expected to be in the hundreds of millions. There is no time limit on how far back claimants can go to recoup their fees, yet ANZ will ask the court to impose a limit next week. Scroll down for video . Bank customers may get millions paid back as part of the class action, which could target up to nine Australian banks including ANZ . Maurice Blackburn lawyer Andrew Watson said bank customers should not be subjected to the excessive credit card late fees, which vary from $5 for NAB customers to $20 at the Commonwealth Bank, reported Yahoo!7. 'We'll be alleging as we have in our earlier case against the ANZ that the late payment fees are penalties and excessive, and customers should get the difference between what they were charged and the true cost to the bank,' he said. Unlike previous bank class actions which were 'closed classes' and meant victims needed to register to be involved, the current action is an 'open class'. More than 180,000 customers have already registered, which could result in a $223 million payout. Maurice Blackburn has previously had a partial victory  against ANZ in a Federal Court case running for about four years and has filed similar class actions the Commonwealth Bank, NAB, Westpac and Citibank. The class action is the biggest in Australian history and aims to claw back excessive credit card late fees of up to $35 . In February, Justice Michelle Gordon found ANZ's credit card late fees of up to $35 were 'extravagant and unconscionable' as the cost to the bank was a low as 50 cents and that the fee was a penalty. She also waived the standard six-year time limit for legal action so there were no constraints on claiming late fees beyond this period as customers did not know the bank's fees were unlawful until the lawsuit was filed in 2010. Yet she did throw out claims against the bank that overlimit and dishonour fees were excessive. Exception fees net the banks billions of dollars, with late credit card fees making up about 25 per cent of this amount. In 2012, the High Court ruled as part of the bank fee action that it was possible for bank fees to be penalties. ANZ and Maurice Blackburn will challenge the original credit card late fee ruling in the Federal Court on Monday. Although the exact amount of victims is not known, if successful the payout could be in the hundreds of millions . If the law firm is successful and the court strikes down additional bank fees, it is expected the firm will lodge more class action suits and this could see the payout amount increase. Yet if ANZ wins, the lawsuit filed today would be quashed. In a third possible scenario, if the decision previously made to waive the usual six-year limit is overturned,  the amount claimed by victims could be cut.

"By . Katy Winter . At first glance a high glamour glossy fashion shoot, these pictures soon reveal themselves to be so much more. The opulent jewellery dripping off the model’s ears are in fact diamond encrusted hearing aids, and several of the shots also show the model leaning on elaborately decorated walking aids. The project, called Tools of Life, is the work of ethical artist Elana Langer and photographer Hanna Agar, both from New York, and aims to challenge the stigma and social discomfort of disability. Not only a stunning and extravagant fashion statement, these dripping diamonds conceal a functional hearing aid . Artist Elana Langer both models in the shoot and designed and made the glamourous walkers and hearing aids . The pair decided to have the project in natural situations such as hailing a cab, in a hair salon or trying on lingerie, but with a glamorous twist . On the projects blog, Elana, who runs ethical company ‘What I live by’, says: ‘One tool of enhancement, like clothing or jewellery, doesn’t have to compromise another tool of enhancement like the ability to hear or walk with greater ease. They are both enriching our experiences in the world'. Elana, who hand crafted all the hearing aids and walkers for the project, was inspired by her own grandmother, who resisted using such aids because of the connotations associated with them. ‘I don’t remember a time when her hair and nails weren’t done and she wasn’t dressed impeccably. In the last year of her life she, like many others in her condition, lost the ability to walk without support. 'And although she had a strong will to live, the idea of using a walker in public seemed unbearable to her. The force of her vanity had come up against the limit of the body. I loved my grandmother deeply and I miss her in this world and I hope these pictures would make her smile.' Posing herself in the project, the pair decided to have the project in natural situations such as hailing a cab, in a hair salon or trying on lingerie, but with a glamorous twist. Although Elana doesn't actually use a hearing aid or a walker she wanted to embody the idea and channel the elegance of her grandmother. Elana was inspired to create the pieces by her grandmother's elegance . The project, called Tools of Life and aims to challenge the stigma and social discomfort of aids . Elana says: 'One tool of enhancement, like clothing or jewelry, doesn't have to compromise another tool of enhancement like the ability to hear or walk with greater ease' The decorated and embellished hearing aids and walkers can be available on special order . Photographer Hanna Agar, from New York, collaborated on the project. Speaking to MailOnline Hanna says: ‘I chose to do this project because the moment Elana mentioned it to me I could just imagine this world where all these people were walking around with blinged out walkers, just rocking it down the street. ‘And having hearing aids be just as beautiful as earrings; it felt like a celebration of life and what we can do, instead of a chore and embarrassment and a reminder of what we lack. ‘I love creating photographs that have a deeper message than just being a pretty picture, which was why this project really spoke to me.

"By . Steve Nolan . Gone: Derek Bonnard who has been sacked as deputy chief constable of Cleveland Police . The deputy chief constable of a scandal-hit police force has been sacked for gross misconduct and could now be forced to repay his £40,000 salary after misusing public funds. Derek Bonnard was sacked from his role at Cleveland Police force by an independent panel after six counts of gross misconduct against the officer were upheld. Mr Bonnard had been suspended from duty while disciplinary proceedings were carried out. In a catalogue of misconduct, Mr Bonnard was found to have deliberately obstructed a criminal investigation into corruption in the force, misused public funds as well as a force credit card, accepted inappropriate hospitality and acted improperly in a redundancy matter. The former officer also cost the taxpayer more than £5,000 when he hired a vehicle 'inappropriately' and crashed it into a canopy at Cleveland Police headquarters in Middlesborough. Derek Bonnard had been suspended by Cleveland Police pending the outcome of disciplinary proceedings. His former boss, Sean Price, had become the first chief constable to be dismissed in 35 years when he was sacked in October last year. The decision to sack Mr Bonnard was made by an independent panel after an investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Police estimate that the hearing cost the public £500,000. He had publicly said that he was innocent of any wrongdoing in May last year and pledged to repay his salary if he an investigation proved him wrong. Despite the result of the hearing, Mr Bonnard said that he will launch an appeal in an attempt to 'clear my name'. Cleveland Police Chief Constable Jacqui Cheer said today that the force will take action against Mr Bonnard if the money is not repaid. She said: 'He also described the investigation as highly expensive, recognising that it was funded by tax payers. 'Quite clearly, he is not innocent of any wrongdoing, and he has succeeded in delaying his misconduct hearing, which has incurred additional cost for the tax payer. Dismissed: Former Chief Constable of Cleveland Police, Sean Price, pictured after accepting the Queen's Police medal in 2005 was the first police chief to be sacked in 35 years last year . 'Mr Bonnard’s actions were reflective of the culture at the top of the organisation at that time, and measures have been put in place to ensure that this type of behaviour is not repeated. 'Throughout the investigation and the disciplinary process he has sought to blame others for his own actions and behaviours. 'He has let himself down, he has let Cleveland Police down but most importantly, he has let the people of Cleveland down. 'The Force deserves much better from one of its most senior officers. 'I am disappointed that he has at no stage of the process attempted to take any responsibility for his actions or show any concern for how much this has cost the public of Cleveland. 'If he had admitted his misconduct earlier, he would have saved the taxpayer a significant amount of money. 'Derek Bonnard made a commitment through his legal team in the High Court that should he be dismissed following this hearing, he would pay back the salary he has received since November 2012. Sacked: Derek Bonnard is to launch an appeal against his dismissal . 'This amounts to over £40,000. If this is not forthcoming, action will be taken to recover this money.' Mr Bonnard said he planned to appeal the decision after being treated 'appallingly'. In the last 18 months the force has made numerous policy changes to prevent further corruption such as that investigated by Operation Sacristy. The steps include reducing the number of corporate credit cards from 71 to 46 and updating the policy for their use. It has also changed its guidelines on gifts and hospitality and set up an Integrity and Transparency Board. The force said one matter of potential gross misconduct for Mr Bonnard has been deferred pending the outcome of the wider criminal investigation ongoing by Operation Sacristy. As Mr Bonnard is no longer a serving police officer, he is not subject to any further police disciplinary processes, the force statement said. He had faced a seventh charge that he had acted contrary to Cleveland Police policy in the purchase of a vehicle provided to him by the Police Authority, a claim that the IPCC said was not proven. IPCC commissioner Nicholas Long said: 'Senior police officers are expected to lead by example and adhere to principles including accountability, honesty and integrity. 'Mr Bonnard demonstrated a flagrant disregard for those principles. 'The evidence showed he used public money as if it was his own and appears to have taken whatever opportunities he could to benefit himself. 'He was a public servant who forgot about the public he was appointed to serve. 'Mr Bonnard's dismissal follows that of former chief constable Sean Price and brings to an end a sorry further chapter for the Cleveland Police. 'The two most senior police officers in the force have had their careers unceremoniously ended because of their individual failings. 'Events of the past two years can only have diminished public confidence in the force. 'I hope the conclusion of these disciplinary matters can act as a salutary reminder to all senior police officers that their role is to ensure the communities they serve are protected from crime and that they must be public servants beyond reproach.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The accuracy of a New York Times bestseller in which Dr. Eben Alexander writes about his alleged experiences in the afterlife after slipping into a coma has been called into question after a doctor who treated him revealed several inaccuracies with his story. ‘Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Afterlife’ has sold nearly two million copies and remained on best-seller lists for over 35 weeks. But now an investigation of Dr. Alexander's past and some of his book's claims have revealed a series of factual omissions and inconsistencies that call significant parts of his story into question. Dr. Eben Alexander is facing claims that his best-seller 'Proof of Heaven' features a series of factual omissions and inconsistencies . ‘I think when you buy a book that’s marketed as a nonfiction book, when that book’s called “Proof of Heaven,” I think that carries with it certain expectations of accuracy,’ Esquire contributing editor Luke Dittrich, who carried out the investigation, told TODAY on Tuesday. As a neurosurgeon, Dr. Alexander claims he had always leaned more towards science than religion, but then he nearly died four years ago when a bout of bacterial meningitis put him into a seven-day coma. When he emerged from his coma, Alexander described visions of heaven he had seen. ‘So much of what I saw on my journey showed me how primitive our science is,’ he said in a promotional video made for ‘Proof of Heaven’ which was released in October 2012. Interviews with the likes of Oprah Winfrey have helped 'Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Afterlife' sell nearly two million copies and remain on best-seller lists for over 35 weeks . In an article, titled ‘The Prophet’ in the August issue of Esquire, contributing editor Luke Dittrich claims to have found inaccuracies in Dr. Alexander’s story. In one chapter Dr. Alexander writes about screaming out ‘God help me!’, a claim contradicted by the emergency room physician treating him that day. Dr. Laura Potter said she had no recollection of him crying out, plus she had intubated him – making it impossible for him to speak. Alexander also writes that he slipped into the coma as a result of E. coli bacterial meningitis and had no higher brain activity, while Dr. Potter says the coma was medically induced and the patient was conscious, though hallucinating. The Esquire article also accuses Alexander of falsifying medical records to cover up the fact that he’d operated at the wrong site on a patient’s spine when working as a neurosurgeon. The August issue of Esquire features an in depth feature by contributing editor Luke Dittrich which debunks a number of Dr. Alexander's claims . Dittrich even claims that Alexander changed the . weather during the week he was in a coma for dramatic effect. Following the publication of the Esquire article, Alexander has issued a statement in which he has said he is keeping to his side of the story. ‘I stand by every word in this book and have made its message the purpose of my life,’ he wrote. ‘Esquire's cynical article distorts the facts of my 25-year career as a neurosurgeon and is a textbook example of how unsupported assertions and cherry-picked information can be assembled at the expense of the truth.’ The Esquire article isn’t the first time that Alexander's claims have been come into question. In April, Michael Shermer at Scientific American said the author's ‘evidence is proof of hallucination, not heaven.’","The accuracy of Dr. Eben Alexander's New York Times bestseller has been called in question .

"By . Bianca London . While beards have never been more fashionable, a new survey reveals that almost half of men cannot even grow a proper one. As many as 45 per cent of men complain that they have bald patches in their beard or sideburns and as a result, men are increasingly getting their beards and sideburns bolstered with hair transplants. These men are splashing out £4,000 on beard and sideburn transplants to copy the more hirsute look favoured by stars like Hugh Jackman, Ben Affleck and David Beckham. According to the International Society of Hair Restoration, more than 4,500 facial hair transplants were carried out in the UK last year - that's more than three times as popular as nose jobs. Celebrity inspirations: Men are splashing out £4,000 on beard and sideburn transplants in an attempt to emulate Ben Affleck (left) and Hugh Jackman . But how does it work? Hair is taken from the back of the scalp in a strip and transplanted into the bald patches of the beard or the sideburn. Dr Shahmalak, a surgeon at Crown Clinic in Manchester, said he has seen a 25 per cent increase in the number of procedures over the last three years as beards have become more fashionable. 'A proper, full-grown beard has been the ultimate definition of masculinity for centuries. But the sad truth is that many men in Britain struggle to grow beards, sideburns and moustaches. Before and after: Hair is taken from the back of the scalp in a strip and transplanted into the bald patches of the beard or the sideburn . 'They have significant gaps in their facial hair and the end result can look patchy and unconvincing. 'Their problems can be easily remedied with a transplant. We can fill out the areas on their face where there are gaps and they can adopt whatever look they like: a bushy moustache, big sideburns like Bradley Wiggins or the sexy designer stubble or beards often sported by David Beckham or Hugh Jackman. Facial hair transplants work in the . same way as hair transplants performed to the patient’s head, using a . technique called Follicular Unit Extraction (or FUE). This is a . minimally invasive transplant technique, which is carried out under . local anaesthetic. The procedure involves taking individual hairs from . an area on the head where the hair is plentiful, and transplanting these . hairs into the areas on the face that the patient would like to . target. A standard FUE . facial hair transplant procedure can last many hours, depending on the . number of hairs which require transplanting & is performed under a . local anaesthetic. The number of hairs required will be assessed by a . hair transplant surgeon and this will depend on the density the patient . is looking for. 'Men see people David Beckham and want to . copy his look. He does all kinds of interesting things with his facial . hair. He'll wear a full beard one month, designer stubble the next and . we've also seen him with a moustache and clean-shaven. 'He cleverly uses his facial hair to completely change his image - it is part of what makes him such an enduring style icon.' Dr Shahmalak, who has carried out two hair transplants on Embarrassing Bodies star Christian Jessen, explained that patchy facial hair was a genetic problem. 'If the father had trouble growing a beard then there is a good chance the son will also have patchy facial hair. 'It is why men in Mediterranean countries often have strong beards - it simply runs through one generation to the next.' Dr Raghu Reddy, Hair Transplant Surgeon at The Private Clinic, added: 'Facial hair transplants are continuing to grow in popularity, particularly as we see beards coming back into fashion. 'Men who choose to undergo facial hair transplants are often cash rich, time poor, working men who want to look their best and are looking for effective, long lasting results. 'A facial hair transplant is a good option for men who do have facial hair but would like it to be thicker or fuller or to achieve a desirable shape of beard. 'We expect the demand to grow as it is a walk in walk out procedure with minimal downtime.' The poll also revealed that 59 per cent of men said that a beard made them feel more macho. While a beard can boost a man's self-esteem, it does very little for his sex appeal, according to women. Two-thirds of women said they preferred the clean-shaven look to a beard.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Residents in Moab, Utah are trying for a third time to get a popular canyon just outside the city renamed because they believe the current name is embarrassing and disrespectful. Local resident Louis Williams says he . cringes every time he has to tell visitors that the name of the canyon is Negro Bill Canyon. Williams, a window cleaner who has lived in the area for 14 years, has posted an online petition that has garnered more than 600 signatures. He plans to submit a formal renaming . application to the U.S. Board of Geographic Names. Residents in Moab, Utah have started a petition to have Negro Bill Canyon renamed because they are embarrassed by the name . Local resident Louis Williams says the current name make him cringe, but the NAACP's Jeanetta Williams, right, believes it is an important piece of black history . The canyon was named after black cowboy William 'Bill' Grandstaff who lived in the area from 1877 to 1881. ‘People cringe when we have to tell the name of it. The looks on their face is: “What did you just say?”’ Williams said. ‘People ask. “Why is it named that?” They don’t ask who he is.’ But president . of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People’s Salt Lake City chapter, Jeanetta Williams, has said her . organization will oppose the name change just as it has when the proposal has been put forward before. ‘If the name changes, it’s going to lose its history,’ she said. ‘Negro is an acceptable word.’ Even though efforts in the late 1990s . and 2000s to change the canyon name were met by resistance from the . NAACP, Williams is optimistic the idea will gain more traction this . time. ‘Most of the places and streets and . trails that were named after settlers just used their last names,’ Williams said. ‘That is what we should do for him.’ The canyon was named after black cowboy William 'Bill' Grandstaff who lived in the area from 1877 to 1881 . The online petition was launched by local resident Louis Williams last week . There are hundreds of canyons, reservoirs and lakes throughout the U.S. still bearing names now deemed derogatory . For nearly 100 years the canyon had an even worse name featuring the 'N-word', which was changed in the 1960s apparently at the request of First Lady Lady Bird Johnson. Louis Williams says the current name and its earlier, ruder, variation is disrespectful. He wants the southern Utah canyon  to be renamed Grandstaff Canyon. 'I don't think he introduced himself . that way and I know that isn't the way his parents named him,' he told KLS.com. 'All the other settlers in this area have got the respect . of their given names. So I think we should give a little bit more . homage to Mr Grandstaff.' The campaign is one of dozens across the country to rename canyons, reservoirs, lakes and other places still bearing names deemed derogatory. There are 757 places with ‘negro’ in the name from Alaska to Florida and Maine to California, according to an analysis of government records. It’s difficult to say precisely how many offensively named towns and geographic features remain as state lawmakers don't always agree with federal government on geographical labels, and people have varying levels of sensitivity. Government mapmakers have however been working for decades to clean up such relics from less enlightened times. The U.S. Board on Geographic Names, a branch of the Interior Department, issued two blanket rules decades ago to erase racial slurs from federal maps. In 1962, the U.S. Board of Geographic Names replaced ‘N*****’ with ‘Negro’ in the names of at least 174 places, when 'Negro' was still widely considered an acceptable alternative. Along with Negro Bill Canyon, there are more than 700 other places with 'Negro' in the name including Free Negro Point in Louisiana and several Little Negro Creeks. ‘Jap’ was switched to ‘Japanese’ in 1974 in dozens of places. The also remain more than 800 places with ‘squaw’ – an offensive word for a Native American woman with sexual undertones - in their title including South Dakota's Squaw Humper Dam, Squaw Humper Table and Little Squaw-Humper Creek. A handful of state legislatures have banished select racial slurs from their maps, yet there remain places such as Arizona’s Dago Spring and Gringo Gulch, Florida’s Jew Point, New York’s Polack Swamp, Indiana’s Redskin Brook and Chinaman Bayou in Louisiana, to name just a few. GOP presidential candidate and Texas Gov. Rick Perry got into trouble last year, after it was revealed his family had long held a lease on a hunting camp in Texas known to many locals as ‘N*****head,’ a name that appeared on a large rock on the property. Perry claims his father painted over the name as soon as he bought the land, although some in the area dispute the governor’s timeline. N*****head was a fairly common place name in the 19th century.

The range is called Purple Ivy and includes a remarkable 82 pieces, including necklaces, rings, bracelets, bangles, brooches and earrings. Scroll down for video . There are six collections under the labels Lady, Girl Next Door, Vintage Colour, Mysterious, Nature and Rustic Animals. Chief executive Jim McCarthy says he wants Poundland, which has made a virtue of the fact that its products cost only £1, to become a force in high street jewellery. He believes shoppers will be happy to wear Poundland jewellery, saying: ‘Behavioural changes of shoppers are benefiting the value sector. Value is now absolutely a badge of honour for customers across the spectrum.’ He pointed out that 22 per cent of Poundland’s customers are now from the more affluent ‘AB’ demographic. Birds kiss on the pendant to this bargain necklace: Chief executive Jim McCarthy says he wants Poundland, which has made a virtue of the fact that its products cost only £1, to become a force in high street jewellery . Pretty things for a pound a piece: A £1 'gold' chain and a charm bracelet - also only a quid . A spokesman announced the arrival of Purple Ivy by saying: ‘Diamonds are a girl’s best friend and we all like to feel glamorous when dressing up. Whether it’s for a night out or a day at the office, accessorising an outfit need not cost a fortune. The new jewellery range is for people on a budget who still want to look great.’ The store says its Lady range includes pearls and crystals ‘for a classy, elegant look’. It adds: ‘These pieces complement smart and evening dresses really well.’ The Girl Next Door look is presented as a dainty collection of pieces including bows and roses, while the Vintage items include enamel-effect bracelets and rings, and Mysterious is a modern collection of simple silver and black items. The Nature pieces are described as ‘subtle’ and suitable for those with a ‘peaceful and serene persona’. The Rustic Animals collection is defined by a bronze gold-effect colour scheme, which is deliberately designed to give an antique appearance, featuring stylised representations of creatures. Initial responses on Poundland’s Facebook page have been positive, with shoppers describing some of the items as ‘beautiful’ and ‘gorgeous’. An owl necklace has been particularly popular. Budget bazaar: As shoppers scrimp and save, Poundland's reported sales have hit almost £1billion a year . The company has succeeded by overcoming a middle-class prejudice that saw some communities launch campaigns to keep the chain out of their high streets. Its tactics have revolved around launching ranges that are specifically designed to appeal to a more upmarket shopper, things such as gardening gloves and grow-your-own seeds. A Jane Asher bakery range has also sold in huge quantities on the back of the home baking revival triggered by the BBC’s Great British Bake Off competition. Since launching in April, sales have been almost double the predicted figures with the result that the range has been expanded to more than 50 items. The chain recently reported that sales have hit almost £1billion a year amid the biggest change in shopping habits in 60 years. The growth came on the back of the opening of 60 more stores, taking the total to 528, while it plans to expand the empire further with a target of some 1,000 outlets. The retailer, which is based in the West Midlands and opened its first store in Burton-on-Trent in 1990, is also looking overseas. It has more than 30 shops under the Dealz brand in Ireland and has started opening shops in Spain.","Purple Ivy range of trinkets includes six different collections .

Hundreds of travellers arriving at Gatwick Airport’s south terminal have suffered several hours’ delays in picking up their luggage, with many being told to go home without it and get it sent later. A spokesman for the airport said the overnight delays were caused by staff shortages at baggage handling firm Swissport. Gatwick airport officials apologised and said they were working with airlines and handling agents to ‘improve operations’. Frustration: The delays at Gatwick airport were caused by staff shortages at baggage handling firm Swissport . ‘Due to resourcing issues with the baggage handlers Swissport there were overnight issues and delays with passengers' luggage on some flights,’ a spokesman for the airport said. ‘Gatwick provided extra staff to help the airlines and their baggage handlers improve their service, as well as providing welfare and water for passengers waiting in the baggage areas, but we are sorry for the delays they faced. Baggage operations are now returning to normal.’ Officials at the airport told passengers of British Airways flights who had waited more than an hour to collect their bags, and those on Monarch, Thomas Cook or Thompson flights who had been waiting 90 minutes or more, that their luggage would be sent to their home address. It is understood easyJet passengers have also been affected but had not been advised to leave without their baggage. Many passengers, with some having to wait more than four hours before collecting their luggage, vented their anger on Twitter. Lulu Breed tweeted: ‘@Gatwick_Airport 4 hours for a suitcase!

No time to lounge around this year: Stephen Davies has turned his love of the seaside stalwart into a thriving business that now numbers Liberty, Conran and even Fred Perry amongst his customers . Stephen's passion for the deckchair began in 1981 when he was a student, and used to work as a beach attendant. After university he struggled to find work and instead launched his own business renting the seats out to members of the public. He then bought two old furniture manufacturing machines dating back to before the Second World War, that had been altered to make deckchairs. Branching into clothing: Fred Perry stock shirts based on traditional deckchair patterns . Over the last 20 years Stephen has refined the process and he is now the only producer of them in the UK. He has worked with designers including Conran and Liberty to produce chairs and has even worked with Fred Perry to create a stripe and colour for a range of their clothing. Stephen said: 'It began in 1981 when I was at the Portsmouth Polytechnic and I worked as a beach attended throughout the summers and really enjoyed it. 'After university I struggled to find work and didn't know what to do, so I applied through the council and set up a business renting out deckchairs to people. Seaside chic: Stephen has also lent his deckchair design to making accessories like these bags . 'After about a year the chairs were getting ropey but new ones were really expensive, and then I heard about some old machines that were going. 'I put the machines in a rented workshop and started trying making the deckchairs myself, I eventually got them going and the first one took three weeks to do. 'I started selling them to local councils across the country and since then it has gone from strength to strength. 'When I first started selling deckchairs it was something that was on the decline because since the 1960s package holidays had taken over. Iconic red stripes: A model wears one of the new Fred Perry designs . Turning back the clock: Stephen as a deckchair attendant on Southsea beach in 1983 . 'People were leaving holidays at seaside resorts like Brighton and Blackpool in favour of trips to Spain, usually Benidorm. 'The resorts were almost preserved as they were and feel like they have been in a time warp and that's why English seasides are so lovely. 'With the nice weather I think we could see a boom in sales, especially as they seem to appeal to the younger generation now which could be because of the vintage trend. Folding chairs date back to the Bronze Age and were also used in Ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome. The modern day deckchair got its name as they were originally used on ocean liner decks in the 1860s.","Stephen Davies is enjoying busiest summer yet as deckchair maker .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . They are the nostalgic images that capture a glorious bygone era – a sepia time of domestic travel, short journeys and unfussy breaks on UK soil. And now, a range of promotional posters depicting the golden age of British seaside holidays looks set to make a small fortune – in America. Vintage rail posters advertising seaside resorts in Devon and Cornwall are in line to fetch around £2,000 at an auction – on the other side of the Atlantic – next month. Different time, familiar places: These glorious vintage posters, including adverts for Paignton and Bude, will go under the hammer in New York in August . The images will go under the hammer at the Swann auction house in New York. One poster alone – emblazoned with the words 'Newquay on the Cornish Coast', produced for the Great Western Railway in 1937 by artist Alfred Lambart – is expected to sell for between $1,000 and $1,500 dollars (£584-£877) in New York on 6 August. What will they make of this in New York? The images celebrate the seaside towns of Devon and Cornwall and are expected to fetch around £2,000 at auction . Another pre-war poster – produced for the Southern Railway in 1935, featuring the words 'Bude for sunshine and surf' – is set to fetch between $800 and $1,200 (£467-£701). A poster for British Railways, produced circa 1956 – bearing with the words 'Paignton, Torbay's ideal holiday centre' – is valued at between $700 and $1,000 (£409-£584). Snapshots of a bygone age: The Welsh town of Aberystwyth is one of those advertised, along with Clacton-on-Sea on the Essex coast . Another British Railways poster – featuring the words 'Teignmouth IS Devon', produced in or around 1960 – is expected to sell for between $400 and $600 dollars (£233-£350). In the early and middle parts of the 20th century, when comparatively few people owned cars, and when expensive overseas holidays were beyond the financial reach of many people, railway companies commissioned artists to produce colourful, eye-catching posters featuring seaside resorts, beauty spots and places of historical interest. Return to the age of innocence: The posters capture a time of simple holidays taken on British beaches, before package holidays were introduced . They were a romantic bid to boost rail travel throughout Britain – and they worked. In recent years, these posters, which once adorned and brightened railway station platforms and waiting rooms, have become increasingly sought-after and valuable mementoes of a gentler, more innocent age. In the early and middle parts of the 20th century, when comparatively few people owned cars, and when expensive overseas holidays were beyond the financial reach of many people, railway companies commissioned artists to produce colourful, eye-catching posters . Their value was ably demonstrated 12 years ago. In 2002, at Christie’s auction house in London, a 1932 Great Western Railway poster by artist Bruce Angrave – featuring the words 'Newquay, Cornwall's finest Atlantic resort’ – sold for £8,225.

Nick Collins took a tumble outside Wembley from what appeared to be a small off-camera ladder while reporting on an injury to Michael Carrick last year. There was the glorious moment in 2010 when Jeff Stelling, in full flow on Soccer Saturday, goes over to Chris Kamara live at Fratton Park for Portsmouth versus Blackburn where there has just been a red card. ‘I don’t know Jeff, has there?’ Kamara says in a panic. ‘I must’ve missed that. Red card?’ He continues to look backwards and forward from the pitch to the camera in disbelief.

"By . Travelmail Reporter . Buying a holiday home, a trip to the Maldives and swimming with dolphins are all top of the average British person’s bucket list. Driving Route 66 in America, a romantic trip to Venice and marvelling at the Egyptian Pyramids also featured in the top 40 things people would most like to do before they die. Floating in the Dead Sea, riding in a hot air balloon, and taking in the view from the top of the Empire State Building also made it on to the checklist of must-do experiences. Must-visit: The Maldives scooped third place in the top 40 things to do before you die list . Road trip! Driving Route 66 was ranked in the top 10 of things Brits have on their bucket list . The desire to learn a new language also scored highly, with almost a third of those surveyed eager to improve their linguistic skills. The survey reveals that alongside more materialistic wishes a significant 60 per cent simply want to stay as healthy as possible. The study of 2,000 people, commissioned by Engage Mutual, found the average person holds 16 key dreams they want to achieve in life. Up and away: The survey revealed Brits want to ride in a hot air balloon, pictured in Cappadocia, Turkey . 1. Have a holiday home abroad2. Learn a new language3. Go on holiday to the Maldives4.

However, 60 per cent concede that realistically they will never get close to achieving the majority of their aims with many not having ticked anything off their bucket list for at least six months. The study also found swimming with dolphins is a dream for more than a quarter of us, taking in the sights of Paris from the Eiffel Tower is also among the top 40 bucket list dreams. Self- improvement was another common theme among the bucket list items, with the desire to learn an instrument an ambition in common for 17 per cent, while volunteering for a good cause is important for 14 per cent. Spokesman Engage Mutual said: ‘The results reveal a colourful array of aims and ambitions that many of us hope to fulfil during our lives. Travel must-dos: A trip up the Empire State Building in New York ranked in 11th place on the list . ‘Many seek to ensure things are in place for a comfortable retirement during which they can help children and grandchildren achieve their own aims. ‘But many feel they won't be able to fulfil all of these dreams, blaming their financial positions for holding them back.’When reflecting on their lives so far people were most likely to say the financial side of life was the area that hadn't gone as well as planned with 40 per cent wishing they were better with money. Retirement is a key focus with half of respondents aiming to ensure theirs is as comfortable as possible, something which becomes even more of a priority the closer it gets. Big adventure: Brits stamp a visit to the Pyramids in Egypt as number eight on the top 40 things they want to do . A third of respondents cite the ability to leave their children with a property or good inheritance as their biggest goal with their remaining time. Yet 48 per cent of those still working worry they have not set themselves up financially or saved enough. Work-life balance also proves elusive - more than a third feel they have got the balance wrong. Mutual added: ‘Finding the balance between financial security to ensure your later years are comfortable, while making sure life is lived and experienced fully today is a challenge. ‘But planning for the good times and the not so good times will always be a better option than burying our heads in the sand.’","2,000 Brits quizzed on things they want to do before they die .

"By . Charlotte Griffiths . Romantic break: Pippa Middleton and her boyfriend Nico Jackson have embarked on a romantic Caribbean holiday in secret . Pippa Middleton and her boyfriend Nico Jackson have embarked on a romantic Caribbean holiday in secret, according to friends who suspect that they may have become engaged. Confidants of the couple say that they have been on holiday for two weeks and are believed to be renting a villa on an island, likely  to be Mustique – the exclusive destination where the Middleton clan regularly takes breaks and where Nico first went on holiday with the family. Miss Middleton, 29, and 35-year-old Mr Jackson have been dating for more than six months, and observers have said the couple have looked ‘closer  than ever’ when out together in recent weeks. The Mail on Sunday revealed in July that the couple were poised to tie the knot, but were delaying an announcement until Pippa’s sister, the Duchess of Cambridge, safely delivered her baby. According to reports last night, the couple have become secretly engaged but will not announce it formally until after Pippa’s 30th birthday next Friday. Mr Jackson, a stockbroker, is said to have been coy about introducing Miss Middleton to his friends in his home town of Folkestone, Kent. A close friend said last night: ‘We all suspect there’s been an engagement but no one’s been  told yet. Loved-up: Pippa is usually seen out and about with stockbroker boyfriend Nico Jackson . Couple: Pippa Middleton and Nico Jackson holding hands at Wimbledon during the men's semi-final between Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic . Obviously there’s been a suspicion he’s embarrassed to bring her down to meet his friends, instead he wants to bring us up  to London to meet her soon. The couple were seen together  at Wimbledon and Miss Middleton wrote in Vanity Fair in the summer about her love of tennis and that, ‘if I had to get married, it would be in my tennis whites – shorts with no pleats or frills’. Speculation has also been mounting that Princess Beatrice, who is sixth in line to the throne, could soon become engaged to her long-term boyfriend Dave Clark. Pippa hit the headlines after being a bridesmaid at her sister's wedding in 2011- could she be next to walk down the aisle?","Confidants of the couple say that they have been on holiday for  two weeks .

"By . Ian Parker, Press Association . Felipe Massa has slated Kevin Magnussen for being 'too aggressive' as the Brazilian's world was turned upside down in Germany. For the second successive grand prix, Massa's race was brought to a premature end on the opening lap, following a first corner-shunt with McLaren rookie Magnussen. In the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, Massa was unfortunately taken out by Kimi Raikkonen following the Finn's frightening smash into a metal guardrail, with the 33-year-old simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. Out: Felipe Massa crashes in the first curve of the German Formula One Grand Prix in Hockenheim . Crash: Massa (left) collides with Danish driver Kevin Magnussen (right) on the first corner . At Hockenheim, Massa was left in no doubt the impetuosity of youth wrecked his race, resulting in him being flipped over as the accident unfolded. Mercifully for Massa, the rollbar on top of his Williams did its job, with his car eventually righting itself, allowing him to walk away unharmed. Massa, though, was left fuming with Magnussen as he said: 'When I turned into the corner suddenly another car hit me on my tyres and just flipped me over. 'It was very strange because I didn't know there was a car there, but Magnussen should know I was there as he was behind. Rolling: The high-speed crash saw Massa's car flipped upside down . Sparks flying: The view from Magnussen's car as he crashes into Massa . 'For me he was too aggressive. I was doing my line. If you're doing your line and you're in front then the guy behind needs to choose and needs to brake. 'If I see someone then I will consider doing whatever I can to not be involved in an accident, but it was impossible to see him there. 'He could see and he knew there were two cars there. This is not the first time he was in an accident on the first lap. 'Most of the time these young drivers want to win races at the first corner. If you take most accidents, they happen with them. 'I've not spoken to him, but if I do, I'll tell him to take it easy because I'm not the only one losing out, he does as well. Relief: The Brazilian seemed to be OK after the heavy collision . Sweeping up: Massa gets out of his car before it is collected and taken away from the track . 'I hope it's enough for him to understand to take it easy a little bit more in the next race.' Magnussen, however, felt Massa left him with no room as he said: 'I feel if I'd had somewhere to go there wouldn't have been contact with Felipe. 'I did my best to try and avoid the accident, but there wasn't much else I could do.' Racing director Eric Boullier also exonerated the 21-year-old Dane, stating: 'Massa was on the outside and probably didn't see Kevin, who was on the inside line and had nowhere to go. 'Kevin was quite blameless in the accident, so it's even more annoying it destroyed his chances of finishing in the top four.' Disappointment: Massa revealed he 'very frustrated' by the incident . As for Massa's moment when he was rolled over, he conceded that was a scary sensation. 'I've never flipped in a racing car before, only a go-kart, but it was a very strange feeling to see everything upside down,' said Massa. 'But I didn't have any impact, so when the car stopped I was 100 per cent fine, but just so disappointed.'","Massa's Williams flipped over after contact from young Dane .

"By . Chris Brooke . Updated: . 02:00 GMT, 10 February 2012 . As an enthusiastic member of a historical re-enactment society, John Smith went to great lengths to be as realistic as possible in his role as a German Second World War soldier. Unfortunately, when he left his army machine gun visible in his classic car, passers-by thought it was a real weapon – and called the police. When Smith returned to his vehicle he was surrounded by armed police and arrested. Worrying time: John Smith was swooped upon by armed police after a member of the public reported seeing the butt of his replica machine gun and bayonet on the backseat of his vintage car . The 56-year-old told officers it was only a prop and it had been left in his car in readiness for a display the following day. But because he refused to allow the police to destroy his imitation weapons he was charged and taken to court. Common sense prevailed when the judge . dealing with his case at Sheffield Crown Court recognised he was a . genuine enthusiast and intervened to save Smith from punishment and his . weapons from destruction. Held: The police note after officers took possession of John Smith's deactivated Steyre MP34 German machine gun . Judge Michael Murphy told him: ‘I am quite satisfied that you are not a criminal and this is part of your hobby.’ Police requested the forfeiture of . his deactivated 1934 Steyr MP34 German machine gun, valued at around . £3,000, as well as two replica pistols. But the judge said: ‘I don’t want . historical artefacts to be destroyed and so I am not going to make an . order to destroy these things.’ A compromise was agreed after . discussions between the parties. Smith admitted possessing an imitation . firearm in a public place and was given a  12-month conditional . discharge. And police were told to return his weapons as long as they . were kept in a locked cabinet or in the boot of his 1954 Wolseley car . while travelling to events. The court heard that Smith, of . Barnsley, South Yorkshire, packed his machine gun, his Walther PPK . pistol – which was held together with tape – and his P38 automatic . handgun in the car with his uniforms last August. He was taking his Wehrmacht uniform . and shirt to be washed and ironed at his mother’s house ready for a . ‘living history’ display the next day. Neil Coxon, prosecuting, said: ‘He . dropped off his uniform at his mother’s and then decided to go and see a . friend nearby, leaving his car parked up in a public place. ‘He spent two hours there and police . were alerted because the gun was on the back seat. An armed response . unit turned up and were on the point of putting a window through on the . Wolseley when Mr Smith walked out of a flat 50 yards away.’ Historical: The replica machine gun which led to five costly court appearances for John Smith . Robert Sandford, defending, said it . was ‘ill-judged’ to leave the machine gun only partially covered on the . back seat with the butt visible, but he said there was nothing . ‘sinister’ about travelling with the gun, which was ‘a prop’. After the hearing Smith said he had . refused to accept a ticking off or a caution at the police station . because it would have meant handing over the guns. ‘I couldn’t agree to . that because of their historical significance,’ he said. Decision to make: Judge Michael Murphy, sitting at Sheffield Crown Court, pictured, argued that 'common sense' should be applied to John Smith's case .","56-year-old was preparing for a history display by the Northern World War II Association when he was arrested .

Bai'yali, named after the D'harawal Aboriginal word for stringybark, a eucalyptus species favoured by koalas, is the first of three expected joeys to make an appearance this year. The seven month old spent the day clinging tightly to new mum Tilly, her first foray into the outside world after leaving her mother's pouch. Scroll down for video . Bai'yali made her first public appearance at Taronga Zoo, on northern Sydney Harbour, on Wednesday . The seven-month-old joey is named Bai’yali, after the D'harawal Aboriginal word for stringybark, a eucalyptus species favoured by koalas . Koala keeper Laura Jones said the joey and her mother Tilly were doing well and that Bai’yali was enjoying the koala enclosure, which is full of eucalyptus leaves. 'She’s proving to be a very relaxed and nurturing mum. She's doing all the right things and her joey is thriving,' Ms Jones said. 'Bai’yali is fully out of the pouch now and can often be seen holding on to mum and snuggling in her belly when they are resting.' The joey is getting her first taste of eucalyptus leaves and developing her fluffy fur coat and progressively putting on weight. Since venturing out of her mother's pouch, Bai'yali is getting her first taste of eucalyptus leaves . The young koala is also developing her fluffy fur coat and progressively putting on weight . It will be at least another three months before the joey is ready to explore the enclosure without her mother by her side . But it will be another three months until she is ready to explore the enclosure without her mother. Bai'yali is the first of three joeys expected from the zoo's breeding program this season. Tilly's younger sister and tree-mate, River, is also carrying a male joey - a cousin to Bai’yali. 'He still just fits inside mum's pouch, but it won't be long before he's out and about too,' Ms Jones said. The name Bai'yali was picked in honour of NAIDOC Week, which runs from July 6 to 13.

I didn't actually think Chelsea wasted too much time. As a professional team you do use up some, but there have been much clearer, embarrassing examples down the years. The only advice I was given about this was when refereeing in Europe. The worst offenders were Porto under You Know Who, and I was told that there is absolutely no point cautioning a player for timewasting. Why? Because if you've allowed it to last that long, to become that blatant, then it's simply not worth it. You've not done your job properly in the first place.

Players are always bothering . referees about the clock and additional time, but that would be taken . away with someone sat up in the stands. Having . 30 minutes each half with the clock stopped when the ball is out of . play is the way forward, but that's far too sensible to ever be . implemented.

"By . Ray Massey, Transport Editor . Saab will start making cars again, two years after going to the wall. The Swedish firm will make existing models, such as the 9-3 saloon, but also start producing electric cars. It went bankrupt in late 2011 and was bought by a Chinese-Swedish investment group, National Electric Vehicle Sweden, in June 2012. Saab is to reproduce its 9 x 3 Turbo Saloon in the first batch of vehicles to be made since the company was bought in 2012 . Spokesman Mikael Oestlund said initial production levels at its factory in western Sweden will be ‘modest’ and rise if demand grows. The company is to make a petrol-powered version of the car with the aim of launching an electric version later. Mr Oestlund said: 'You can’t change or develop very much in . a year. We acquired the assets in August last year. 'Our focus has been . to get the co-operation up and running with 400 suppliers and ensure the . facilities were working.' 'We are humble and say we’ll start . the production volume with low figures and be able to increase over time . according to the market’s demand.’ Sales peaked at 133,000 cars in 2006 but slumped to 27,000 only three years later. A Sweden Airforce Arrow shaped SAAB Vigen. The company dates back to 1937 when it manufactured military aircraft . US car giant General Motors (GM) – which also owns Britain’s Vauxhall - bought a 50per cent stake and management control of the firm in 1989, before gaining full ownership in 2000 – though bosses admitted they never knew quite what to do with it. At the Detroit Motor Show in January 2008, General Motors  senior executive Bob Lutz told the Daily Mail ahead of his company’s eventual sale of the Swedish car firm: ‘Saab is the GM executive wife’s vehicle of choice . 'But I don’t think it has ever made a profit in its entire history. We’ve hung onto it longer than we should have.’ American parent firm GM itself sought bankruptcy protection as the global financial crisis unfolded, forcing the US company to dispose of assets. So GM sold Saab to Dutch group Spyker, which in turn eventually sold the firm to Nevs in June last year. The new owners have said they want to focus on electric cars as they look to revive the brand. SAAB’s origins go back to 1937 when Sweden’s Svenska Aeroplan Aktiebolaget (SAAB) was founded in Trollhättan to manufacture military aircraft. At the end of the Second World War, in which neutral Sweden played no active part. SAAB diversified into cars with the first production of the two-stroke-engine Saab 92. It soon became a household name in Sweden and in the 1970s it released its first turbocharged model - the landmark Saab 99. Saabs found favour with architects, independent spirits and  maverick entrepreneurs such as Virgin boss Sir Richard. Loyal enthusiasts appreciated SAAB  for its aerodynamic style and quirks like placing the ignition lock between the front seats rather than on the steering column. It was the first to offer heated seating in 1971.","The company is to reproduce a 'modest' number of its popular 9-3 saloon .

"By . Martin Samuel - Sport . For England, and Roy Hodgson, the World Cup now gets very real. On Thursday, for the first time since qualification was confirmed on October 15, 2013, it can be taken away from them. There is a permutation of results in Group D that would see England removed from meaningful competition by 3pm, local time, on Friday. Another sequence would make progress a possibility in mathematical terms alone. Lose to Uruguay and, if Italy and Costa Rica draw, England are out. Lose to Uruguay and, if there is a winner in the other game, England would need to be the first team in the history of the World Cup to go through having been defeated in their opening two games. Even then, it would require a favour from Italy in the last round of group matches. VIDEO Team Profile: England . Ready for action: England captain Steven Gerrard arrives at the team hotel after touching down in Sao Paulo . Relaxed: James Milner (left) and Jack Wilshere (right) share a joke but it will be all business against Uruguay on Thursday evening . Under pressure: Three Lions boss Roy Hodgson is in desperate need of a win after defeat to Italy in Manaus . Knockout football, Hodgson called it, . and he is right. From here, any team that lost its opening game cannot . afford a second reversal. Even a draw would leave England perilously . close to a humiliatingly early return — with Costa Rica able to play for . a single point in the final match in Belo Horizonte. For . all the praise afforded Hodgson and his players after a  spirited . performance in Manaus, the reality is that no margin for error remains. England . are vulnerable: to rotten luck, to random events and in particular to . the kind of dark arts Gus Poyet, the Sunderland manager, spoke of when . he explained the clash of cultures that will unfold in Sao Paulo. ‘I . know that for you a handball on the goal-line is cheating,’ he said. ‘But not for us. It’s part of the game.’ Poyet’s admission suggests . that, in Uruguay, the ‘by any means necessary’ speech that Daniel . Sturridge gave on Monday would have more sinister meaning. Sturridge . insisted he didn’t mean he would cheat to win. Anyone who has seen . Suarez’s tumble against Argentina in the victory that helped secure . Uruguay’s play-off place would not be similarly assuaged. VIDEO Uruguay vs England fan predictions . Preparation: England were put through their paces at the Sao Paulo Arena on Wednesday . Expectation: Steven Gerrard says England will not treat the Uruguay game like a World Cup final . Swap: Wayne Rooney could drop back to his favoured No 10 role in Sao Paulo on Thursday . Key moments: England manager Hodgson knows his side must deliver against Uruguay . Without . doubt, Suarez is a changed man in English football. Like Didier Drogba, . Cristiano Ronaldo and many imports to the Premier League, he has . discovered that diving is considered one of football’s foulest acts in . his adopted home. If . anything, last season, the times he should have had a penalty and was . unjustly spurned by the referee must have neared double figures. At . a World Cup, in Uruguay’s colours, it is different. A large number of . players here see any form of  contact as justification to fall. There is . no controversy, no inquest, no consequence for them. Thomas Muller’s . theatrics saw Pepe sent off in Germany’s win over Portugal but passed . with barely a comment in Brazil. Sao Paulo’s stadium may be the home of a . club called Corinthians, but there that spirit ends. And . this is do or die, when  Suarez’s almost deranged desire to win takes . over. The downside for Uruguay is no different to that for England — the . threat is greater, in fact, as they have Italy to play last. Suarez . has been rushed back from injury in what amounts to a rare gamble from . coach Oscar  Tabarez. England’s hope, therefore, is that another bold . forward display succeeds in putting distance between the teams, so one . fateful moment cannot influence the outcome. Undoubtedly, Uruguay’s . defence is weak. It needs to be hit, and hard, to counter the Suarez . effect. Danger man: Uruguay forward Luis Suarez, pictured in training on Wednesday, is fit to face England . Determined: Daniel Sturridge admitted he will do everything he possibly can to help England emerge victorious in Sao Paulo . Honest: Sunderland boss Gus Poyet (right) believes Uruguay will go to any length necessary to get a result against Hodgson's side . ‘We believe Suarez . will be back and that will be a big confidence boost for their whole . team,’ said Hodgson. ‘I think we’d be very foolish if we started basing . our ideas about them on one game against Costa Rica. I think we have got . to see beyond that and be ready for a very difficult encounter. ‘There . is no doubt Uruguay are different when Suarez is in the team. Football . is about the players. A team can be organised or not but the bottom line . is always “what players have you got and how many are exceptional?” An . exceptional player can lift a team. We saw Diego Maradona do it with . Napoli.’ Hodgson added: . ‘They had never won anything really in Italy and then suddenly Maradona . pitched up and they become champions and won the Uefa Cup. It doesn’t . really matter whether you have played against someone or know his game, . great players are great players. When you talk about Argentina now it . always comes back to Lionel Messi. In every team there is one name that . is a bit exceptional. ‘It is . not as if we’re going into the unknown, though. We know how good Suarez . is. Our players will have to make certain that they deal with him as . they do when they play against Liverpool. ‘He’s . a front player. He plays all along that line. He makes runs behind . defenders, he comes off and gets the ball short. He does all the things . you want a top player to do. All we can do is ensure our defence is . compact and we don’t give him the space to play as he wants.’ Point to prove: Suarez is hoping to knock England out of the World Cup and get Uruguay's campaign back on track . If . this is seen as Hodgson reverting to cautious type, he should be . indulged. Against all expectation he went to Manaus with a very open . mind  and an even more open game plan, and while England are likely to . field the same attacking team, with perhaps the odd tweak in the . positioning, he will win no plaudits this time for an entertaining or . encouraging defeat. Uruguay were the last of South America’s qualifiers — . needing to win a play-off against Jordan — and looked distinctly . unimpressive without Suarez against Costa Rica. Repeat . the level of performance against Italy and England are expected to win. Fail, and the inquest will delve deeper than the general acceptance . that it just wasn’t England’s day again. Hodgson . seemed to leave a degree of uncertainty around Rooney when, asked if he . might alter his position from wide on the left, he started talking . about refusing to say whether he was in or out. Nobody had suggested he . might be out. He isn’t, and shouldn’t be, but it indicates his future as . a certain starter for England is now up for discussion, behind closed . doors as well as in the public arena. By . returning Rooney to the  middle, as seems likely, Hodgson is hoping to . make a virtue of having England’s leading goalscorer nearer to goal, . where he can inflict most damage. He insisted Rooney’s  performance in . Manaus was not dissected at any great length,  suggesting he was happy . with what he saw. It would be a ferociously brave decision to ditch . Rooney for a match of this significance — and harsh, considering the . selfless way he played against Italy. He needs to be given a chance to . influence this World Cup as a match-winner, to come to the party as . others with his scoring record have done. Finding his feet: Suarez is set for his first piece of action since undergoing a knee operation last month . Centre of attention: Uruguay fell to a surprise 3-1 defeat to Costa Rica without Suarez (centre) on Saturday . The . temperature in Sao Paulo will certainly be friendlier to England than . the Amazonian heat of Manaus and, bar Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, everyone . is fit. Time to deliver is the hoariest old cliche for England at World . Cup tournaments, but it is coming round to that moment just the same. ‘We . didn’t go all-out attack against Italy and we won’t be saying that . against Uruguay, either, but we do have the sort of players that are . capable of hurting them,’ said Hodgson. ‘I thought we played at a very . good pace the other night and I don’t know whether we’re capable of . playing much faster than that. We saw that even a top team like Italy . was tested by the quality of our attacking play and we’re not going to . dispense with any of those weapons.’ Yet, this time, going down fighting won’t be so well received. O . jogo bonito is worthless without its cutting edge. There are a lot of . good, attacking teams at this tournament and England need to join them . in the second round. This is a match England should win; they can get no . further here on looks alone.","England face Uruguay in Sao Paulo needing victory to keep fate in their own hands .

"By . Ray Massey, Transport Editor . Road deaths fell to a record low last year – despite a 14 per cent rise in  motorway fatalities, official figures revealed yesterday. There were a total of 1,713 deaths in reported road casualties in Britain in 2013 - a two per cent dip on the 2012 figure and the lowest annual total since records began in 1926. But motoring groups said ministers needed to be vigilant about fatalities on motorways – long classified as the UK’s safest roads -  where deaths rose by 12, from 88 to 100, marking the first increase  in nearly a decade. Road deaths fell to a record low last year - despite a 14 per cent rise in  motorway fatalities, official figures revealed yesterday . They are concerned that a big reduction in visible traffic police and rise in mobile phone use and texting may have contributed to the rise. And they fear the Government’s decision to  turn 100-miles of motorway hard-shoulders into active lanes to reduce congestion may lead to future increases in m-way casualties. The rising motorway death toll marks the first increase  2005. Transport Department officials  said the 100 motorway deaths were still  42per cent  below the average for 2005 to 2009. Serious injuries in motorway accidents were up 1per cent last year to 660 - the first increase since 2007 - but again the Government  said this was still 32per cent lower than the 2005-09 average. The Department for Transport  pointed out that traffic levels on motorways rose 1.5per cent between 2012 and 2013 while  traffic levels on all other roads remained relatively unchanged between the two years. But AA road safety spokesman Paul Watters: ‘This is concerning, and we need to know why. There has been a huge drop in the number of visible police traffic patrols on our motorways in the past five years. It begs the question whether more drivers are being distracted on their mobile phones or texting because they don’t think there’s a risk of getting caught.’ Overall, the new road casualty figures showed that serious injuries were down by 6 per cent to 21,657 with slight injuries falling by the same percentage rate to 160,300 . There were 26 child pedestrian deaths up to the age of 15 –  a rise of  30per cent  on 2012 -  while deaths of pedestrians aged up to 17 rose 35per cent to 35 last year. Six pedal cyclists and 13 child car occupants also died in this age group. However serious injuries to 0 to 15-year-old pedestrians fell 13per cent to 1,332 last year, while pedal cyclist serious injuries to those aged 0-15 decreased 11per cent to 276. Overall, the new road casualty figures showed that serious injuries were down by 6 per cent  to 21,657 with slight injuries falling by the same percentage rate to 160,300. The death toll in 2013 was almost half that in the middle of the last decade when as many as 3,201 were killed in 2005. Nearly half (46per cent) of the deaths last year were of car occupants while pedestrians accounted for  nearly a quarter (23per cent) of fatalities, motorcyclists  around 1 in 5 (19 per cent) and  pedal cyclists for about 1 in 17 ( 6per cent). The figures also showed that the number of pedal cyclists killed decreased by 8per cent from 118 in 2012 to 109 in 2013. A total of 48 children aged 15 or under were killed in reported road traffic accidents in 2013, compared with 61 children in 2012. The number of children seriously injured fell by 13per cent to 1,932 in 2013, while total child casualties were down 9per cent to the lowest total since detailed records started in 1979.","There were 1,713 deaths in reported road casualties in Britain in 2013 .

"By . Martin Robinson . Claims: Mike Hancock (pictured) has repeatedly denied claims he sent sexy texts and made sexual advances towards a troubled female constituent . A Liberal Democrat MP faces a council investigation after he was accused of sending lewd and suggestive texts to a vulnerable constituent. Mike Hancock is also alleged to have bought clothes and perfume for the single mother, who has since complained about his advances. Portsmouth City . Council, where Mr Hancock is also a councillor, said today it had . decided to refer a complaint against him for formal investigation to see if he broke their code of conduct. The woman’s legal team claim Hancock sent texts to the woman, one of . which is believed to have said: 'Thinking as always of u and missing u. big kiss xxx.' Another allegedly states: 'I miss you sexy. xxx.' Two years ago Hancock's affair with his Russian . researcher Katia Zatulieveter, 27, was exposed. Katia, who worked for Hancock at the . House of Commons, was investigated over claims she was spying for the . Russians. The allegations were never proved. Married father-of-two Hancock, 66, who has served as a councillor for 43 . years and as an MP in two spells totalling 37 years, failed to appear . before the Governance and Standards Assessment Sub Committee at . Portsmouth Guildhall. The MP denies the allegations and refused to discuss it has he left his Hampshire home today. Conservative councillor Donna Jones, who chaired the meeting, said: 'The . case of the complainant will be referred for investigation. 'Michael Lawther (solicitor for Portsmouth City Council), in conjunction . with myself, will be writing to the constituent to advise the outcome.' Probe: Harriet Wistwich (left), solicitor of the defendant spoke to a council committee and members, including chairman Donna Jones (right), agreed to refer the case for investigation . The woman, who has mental health problems, said she wrote to Nick Clegg in March 2011 about her allegations which she claims breach party rules but her letter was ignored. She is now suing him over what she said was a ten-month inappropriate relationship. Harriet Wistrich, solicitor for the alleged victim, said after the meeting: 'We will want to see what investigation it is going to be. 'We will provide them with whatever evidence we can to help with the investigation. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, added: “It’s excellent news. 'I think he should be suspended as a councillor and MP.' Hancock, who is recovering from heart surgery, retained his seat in 2010 with a majority of 5,200 votes, but now faces pressure to stand down. The woman said: 'He has tried to get out of appearing for six months saying he is too ill. 'He claims he is too ill to attend yet he has been attending council meetings and parliamentary meetings.' 'It shows disregard for the process. I think it’s disgusting'. Hampshire Police have already investigated the claims of sexual advances but no action was taken against Hancock. Mr Hancock is also a city councillor in Portsmouth and still represents the Liberal Democrats at City Hall . City solicitor Michael Lawther said: 'A sub-committee of Portsmouth City Council today decided to refer a complaint against Cllr Mike Hancock for investigation. 'The governance and audit and standards committee (assessment) sub-committee - made up of three councillors - considered evidence of a breach of the council's code of conduct and decided there was a case to answer. 'They made no judgement as to whether or not there had been a breach. 'I will now appoint an independent lawyer to carry out an investigation. We estimate the investigation will take two or three months. 'If a breach is proved against a councillor, they can be censured for their conduct.' A spokesman for Mike Hancock said: 'There has been a code of conduct complaint against Mike Hancock in his role as a Portsmouth City councillor, which has been considered by the council's assessment committee. 'The committee's role is to assess whether the person was a councillor at the time of the alleged breach of the code and not to investigate the complaint itself. 'There will now be an investigation under the auspices of the city solicitor for the council. 'Mike Hancock vigorously denies that he has broken the code of conduct. 'The allegations have previously been investigated by the police but no further action was taken. 'Mike Hancock will co-operate fully with the investigations of the city council and does not feel it appropriate to comment further. 'In the meantime he is recovering from major heart surgery and will continue to serve his constituents as an MP and a councillor to best of his ability.'

"By . Carol Driver . An airline has been left in limbo after all its pilots scheduled to work called in sick - forcing it to ground 22 domestic and international flights. Trinidad-based Caribbean Airlines had to resort to the drastic measure on Tuesday in response to the 'unprecedented action' as the result of what is thought to be a wildcat strike. In a statement, the airline said that 'many of its pilots who were [on the roster] to operate flights [were] calling in sick'.

It also issued an apology to its 'loyal passengers' and families who were caught up in the action, which has affected all its flights.

On its website, the airline said: 'Caribbean Airlines confirms that all its international and domestic flights scheduled for today will be affected as a result of many of its pilots who were rostered to operate flights calling in sick.' In an internal release to all staff, CEO Michael DiLollo said: 'We are naturally concerned firstly for the health and welfare of our pilot body since this is an unprecedented occurrence.

"By . Ray Massey, Transport Editor . Don't look now, but the traditional rear view mirror is about to be consigned to the scrap heap. Nissan is ready to replace the mirror with a screen showing footage from  a camera mounted on the back of  the car. The carmaker claims that its redesigned rear view mirror will boost safety because the image seen by the driver will not  be obscured by back-seat passengers, headrests, piled-up luggage or dirty  rear windscreens. Futuristic: How the technology will work. Crucially it will be able to switch back into being a normal mirror . It will also allow rear windows to be made smaller – allowing cars to be more streamlined and aerodynamic – which in turn will help cut fuel consumption. The ‘smart mirror’ with its LCD monitor is housed within the same structure as a conventional rear view mirror. However it renders normal visibility obstructions – such as the pillars either side of the window – ‘a non-issue’, a Nissan spokesman said, adding: ‘Rearward visibility from conventional rear view mirrors can be obstructed when there are tall passengers sitting in the rear seats, or when luggage has been stacked high in the rear compartment. ‘However with the electronic mirror, rearward visibility is free from obstructions. This helps the driver get a much better view of the traffic conditions.’ Nissan’s Andy Palmer said: ‘Smart rear view mirrors will give our customers the best possible view – no matter how tall the passengers in the back seat of the car are and no matter how bad the road conditions are. Backup accidents involving light vehicles cause an average of 210 deaths and 15,000 injuries a year, and victims often are children and the elderly, the U.S. government said . ‘It also offers the possibility of new and exciting designs because it gives us an alternative to a very wide rear window while preserving good visibility.’ The camera works well in rain and snow and at dawn and dusk, and crucially can be switched off to allow the mirror to revert to a conventional reflection if drivers want to check their appearance. Because despite putting themselves at risk of £100 fines as well as penalty points, some 42 per cent of women admit they use rear view mirrors to adjust their make-up. The car company says the technology is ready to be rolled out in Japan, and will be phased in across the rest of the world in 2015. Nissan also plans to use the mirror in its ZEOD RC race car in the Le Mans 24-hour race. Nissan’s race car president Shoichi Miyatani said: ‘Under the harsh driving conditions in the world of motorsports, retaining a clear view for the race driver is of the utmost importance. 'The smart rear view mirror will be a powerful tool for our drivers. We also have high expectations towards improving the cars’ aerodynamic design.’","The LCD monitor would take the same shape and form as a regular mirror .

"The island where the Magna Carta is believed to have been signed, laying the foundations for modern democracy, has been put up for sale for just under £4 million. Magna Carta Island, in the Thames, is thought to be the site where King John met with his rebellious barons in 1215. They signed the Magna Carta - one of the world's best-known documents and widely regarded as the cornerstone of liberty in the English-speaking world. The historic island where the Magna Carta was signed has been put up for sale for just under £4 million . Magna Carta Island, in the Thames, is a 3.72 acre piece of land with 402 metres of river frontage . Although it is not known where exactly the document was signed, it has long been believed that the island was the site of the meeting. The King is said to have chosen the spot because he was protected by a circle of walnut . trees and a gentle curve of the river which kept enemy longbows out of . range. A chapel was built on the island near Wraysbury, Berkshire in the 1600s, and in . 1834, it was expanded into a Grade II listed house by George . Simon Harcourt, Lord of the Manor and the Sheriff of the County. The walls in the charter room have the crest of King John and those of the 25 barons elected to keep the Magna Carta safe. The . owner of the island, which is reached by a humpback bridge, has now put . it on the market for £3.95 million with Sotheby's Realty in Cobham, . Surrey. The island is a 3.72 acre piece of land with 402 metres of river frontage. It is the site where King John met with his rebellious barons in 1215 for one of the most important meetings in British history . The house has a dining room that seats about 16 people, and a staff cottage with two bedrooms and a bathroom . Stuart Cole, head . of region for UK Sotheby's International Realty, said: 'This is a once . in a lifetime opportunity to buy a piece of world history where the rule . of law was first forged. 'Not . only is Magna Carta Island an idyllic private island in the Thames with . 402 metres of prime river frontage it is widely acknowledged to have . been the site of the signing of the Magna Carta, perhaps the most . significant charter in history.' The main home on Magna Carta Island has seven bedrooms, four reception rooms and a swimming pool. A large hallway leads through to a reception and a . kitchen/breakfast room, off which are several small ante rooms. A commemorative plaque at the home. It is believed the island could be the spot where King John placed his seal on the document . On the first floor are six bedrooms along with the master bedroom with dressing room and bathroom and a family bathroom. The cottage opposite the house features a reception room, kitchen/breakfast room, two bedrooms and a bathroom. The . grounds, which were mostly laid out in the 1920s, have an expansive . lawn, topiary ewe trees and several important trees whilst 402 metres of . river bank frontage to the Thames provide mooring for a large boat. In . 1974, Queen Elizabeth II visited the historic island and planted a tree . in the grounds. The gardens also included an additional cottage. On the opposite bank of the river is the Magna Carta Memorial and The Kennedy Memorial. The Magna Carta was first issued on June 15, 1215, by England's King John in Runnymeade. The document was designed to prevent civil war by granting rebellious . barons certain freedoms, including three that are enshrined in American . government: an acknowledgement that taxes cannot be arbitrary, that free . men cannot be imprisoned without first being judged by their peers or . the law and that justice cannot be denied or delayed. The commemorative plaque is part of a centre piece at the house. A chapel was built on the island near Wraysbury, Berkshire in the 1600s.

"By . Sean Poulter . £20m turnover: Food writer Mrs Karmel helped develop a menu for BHS, but a nutritionist complained that the menu listed burgers and sausages as 'healthy' As a children’s food guru,  Annabel Karmel built a multi-million-pound empire telling parents how to cook healthy meals for youngsters. And after lucrative contracts with the likes of Disney, retail chain BHS signed her up to develop a children’s menu for their restaurants. But Mrs Karmel, who was awarded an MBE in 2006 for outstanding work in child nutrition, has been forced to backtrack on claims that her food was ‘healthy and nutritious’ – after a leading expert reported her ‘outrageous’ claims to a local council. Harley Street nutritionist Yvonne Bishop-Weston was horrified when she saw the dishes, which included burgers, sausages, chips and ice cream, were being promoted on posters and menus as healthy options. ‘It is outrageous that food such as burgers, sausages, and sugary snacks are being advertised as healthy,’ she said. ‘Parents and children are bombarded with healthy eating messages. But they are now being faced with confusing advertisements in their local shopping centre for healthy kids’ meals.’ Miss Bishop-Weston contacted trading standards officers in Croydon, South London, who took up the claims with  executives at the store. And the chain, which is owned by billionaire Sir Philip Green, has now agreed to change the wording on the menus. Neil Alcorn, from the food and safety team at Croydon council, said: ‘We have been told they have had several high-level meetings with Annabel Karmel regarding the wording for the children’s meal boards in the store and have agreed that the word “healthy” will be removed from the menu boards.’ In a joint statement, BHS and Mrs Karmel said: ‘New menus will not include the word “healthy”. Instead, they will focus on specific nutritional benefits of each individual product.

"By . Lydia Warren . Tara the cat, who saved her family's four-year-old son from a vicious dog attack that was caught on camera, has been best friends with the boy since he was born, his parents have said. She followed Erica and Roger Triantafilo home from a park in Bakersfield, California about six years ago and has been a member of the family ever since, they said. On Wednesday, she became the nation's most beloved cat when surveillance footage emerged showing her saving their son Jeremy by pouncing on the neighbor's dog as it attacked him. On Thursday, Jeremy snoozed his way through his first live interview on the Today show as his parents described their shock at Tara's act of bravery. Scroll down for video - WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Safe: Erica and Roger Triantafilo sit with their sleeping four-year-old son Jeremy and Tara the cat, who saved him from a vicious dog attack outside their California home . 'It's pretty amazing to see just a cat . take on a dog and selflessly put herself out there,' Roger Triantafilo said. 'That dog did not . even know what hit him.' Erica explained that she had been near to the house watering a tree when the neighbor's dog, an eight-month-old male Labrador-Chow mix, escaped and grabbed her son by the leg. 'I'd never seen a dog just shake a child like that so violently,' she said. 'I just remember hearing him and the next thing I know, I see my cat flying out of nowhere and getting to this dog.' After the attack, Tara can be seen chasing the dog away before returning to Jeremy's side. In an interview with the Bakersfield Californian, his family said she had always been protective over their oldest child and slept in his crib when he was a baby. They also have younger twin boys. Tara the cat, who saved Jeremy, four, from a vicious dog attack that was caught on camera, threw the first pitch at a minor league baseball game . Loved: The cat happily lets the little boy kiss her as he calls her a hero who saved him from a 'mean dog' They added that Tara became part of the family in 2008 when she followed them home from a nearby park - and they accepted her into their home, even though Erica is allergic to cats. She 'really just adopted us from there,' Mrs Triantafilo said. They named her Tara after 'Zatara', which was the name given to Edmond Dantes in The Count of Monte Cristo by smugglers. They told him it means driftwood. 'We named her driftwood because she's our little cat that followed us home,' Triantafilo said. 'She's our little driftwood. She's amazing.' She said that even though her three boys tug at Tara, she sits there and takes it. Lurking: Jeremy Triantafilo was outside his family's home when a neighbor's dog escaped and ran towards him . To the rescue! Tara runs towards her owner as Scrappy shakes him. The dog was euthanized after continuing to show aggression during a 10-day assessment . 'She's the most mellow cat you've ever seen,' she told Today. 'All our boys love her... and she loves them right back.' The video had shown . Jeremy sitting on his bicycle outside his family's home on Tuesday when . the dog escaped its home through an open gate and crept up on him from . behind. Surveillance footage, which Jeremy's father uploaded to YouTube, shows the dog grabbing the boy's leg and pulling him to the ground before violently shaking him with his teeth clamped tight. Then suddenly, an unlikely hero bounds towards him - the family's cat, Tara. The . video shows the fearless feline jumping on the dog with enough force to . push him away from the boy. Tara then chases the dog away from the . driveway with its leg between its tail. Feline brave: The cat launches herself at the startled dog and knocks it away from Jeremy . And don't come back! Tara follows the dog to make sure it has left, before returning to check on Jeremy . The neighbor, who had been pulling out of their gated driveway when the dog escaped, called 911 for the boy and his mother, KERO reported. The boy, who has mild autism, needed 1- stitches to the deep wounds on his legs but is otherwise fine. 'He's just bouncing back from this,' she told Today. 'He . tells us it feels better.' Speaking to Kero, he said: 'Tara is my hero!' The dog was taken by Bakersfield Animal Control and could be rehabilitated at the neighbors' but home but also faces being euthanized. Injuries: Jeremy needed stitches to the wounds on his leg, pictured, but is otherwise fine, his mother said . Relief: Jeremy's parents, Erica and Roger, pictured, said they were relieved his injuries were not worse . The . encounter was caught on surveillance cameras outside the home and . uploaded to YouTube by the boy's father, Roger Triantafilo, on . Wednesday. 'My cat . defends my son during a vicious dog attack and runs the dog off before . he can do additional damage,' Triantafilo wrote beneath the video. 'Thankfully, my son is fine!'

"By . Kerry Mcdermott . Accused: Elaine Hewitt, who is now a social worker, is accused of abusing two young sisters while working as their nanny over 30 years ago . A social worker was today accused of sexually abusing two young sisters while she was working for their family as a live-in nanny. Elaine Hewitt, now 49, is alleged to have warned one of the girls - who were aged six and ten at the time - she would be taken into care if she revealed what had been going on. Married Hewitt, from St Helens in Merseyside, was a teenager working as an au pair for a family near Watford, Hertfordshire, when she is alleged to have carried out the abuse more than 30 years ago. She is now facing nine child sex abuse charges after the younger of the two alleged victims, now aged 38 and 42, went to the police in 2011. A jury at St Albans Crown Court heard the now 38-year-old had always been 'uncomfortable' with Hewitt, who was then called Elaine Duffy, and told police the then nanny had persuaded her to perform a sex act on the defendant on more than one occasion. Police then contacted the older sister, who claims Hewitt would constantly play the Elton John song Blue Eyes. 'She cannot listen to the song without it reminding her of what happened,' prosecutor Sally Mealing-McLeod told the court. 'The Crown says she abused both girls and that the abuse was of a sexual nature,' she said. 'They . told no one at the time. It was only a number of years later that they . both discussed what had happened and subsequently both reported matters . to the police.' Hewitt was aged 18 when the alleged abuse began in 1981. Hewitt was sacked as the family's nanny following the girls' father's 40th birthday party in May 1982, the court heard. '... She abused both girls and the abuse was of a sexual nature' Prosecutor Sally Mealing-McLeod . She went on to work as a matron at a girls' boarding school, then at a school for the blind before becoming a social worker. Hewitt, who was arrested in St Helens in January last year, said she had been the family's au pair, but denied carrying out any sexual assaults. She has pleaded not guilty to all nine charges. One charge of indecency with a child relates to a girl aged between six and seven between May 1981 and July 1982. The rest relate to a girl aged between 10 and 11 in the period from March 1981 and July 1982. The trial continues.

"By . Nigel Jones . We're used to seeing pictures of the First World War in faded brown sepia - dull, muddy, black-and-white photographs that seem to epitomise the drab khaki landscape of shell-blasted sludge that was the trenches in which they were taken. But, 100 years on, the wonders of 21st-century technology now allow us to see these amazing pictures of the conflict in breathtaking full colour, giving us a much keener sense of what it was actually like to be there. British photo technician Frank Augrandjean travelled back in time to colour this selection of images from the Imperial War Museum's archive – specially selected to bring home the full horror of the conflict – exclusively for Weekend magazine. Bloodbath and mudbath Seven stretcher bearers struggle to carry a wounded man to safety in Flanders during the battle of Passchendaele in 1917. Prolonged shelling destroyed drainage ditches and turned the area around the shattered town of Ypres into a quicksand of impassable sucking mud that would bog down wounded men and drown them . Still only 19, Frank started to colour old black-and-white pictures purely as a hobby three years ago. 'People would send me old photos of relatives and I would add colour and send them back,' he says. 'The more photos I did, the better I got at it. I guess that – as with most things in life – practice makes perfect.' Working entirely digitally, Frank takes extraordinary pains to achieve exactly the right results. Once the original photograph has been scanned into his computer, he starts with a base layer of colour for each object in the scene. 'Then the fine details are added on top, such as grains in wood or skin tones, buttons or intricate patterns in clothing.' Pigeon post: Pigeons were often used to carry messages from the front line when radio, Morse code and human runners had failed. Here an officer (far right) writes a message as the pigeon's handler, having removed the bird from its cage, holds it upside down to attach the note . Giddy up: Dismounted cavalrymen take a  rest in a convenient shellhole while their mounts form a protective ring around them. Horses proved  ineffective in trench warfare, and by the war's end they had effectively been replaced by tanks . To do this, Frank magnifies the image to the point where individual pixels can be distinguished, then colours them in with a fine stylus from the huge range of shades available in the palette of his Photoshop software. It can take up to two days of focused concentration to finally bring a photo to life. 'How long it takes depends on the complexity of elements in the original photo,' he says. 'How detailed it is, and how large the image is in terms of resolution. Of course, the object is to make the photo look as if it was taken with a colour camera. Highway to hell: Soldiers gingerly make their way across a path made of wooden duckboards in Chateau Wood near Ypres, Flanders, during the battle of Passchendaele in 1917. Shelling has reduced the wood's trees to gaunt skeletons . There are so many things that have to come together for that to happen: the colour of different areas of the sky, for example, the reflections on anything shiny or wet, the tiniest details such as the blush in a soldier's cheek on a cold day, and the warming colours on a hot one. It takes a lot of patience to get everything to work together, but when it does it looks great.' Since it's impossible to retrieve any sense of original colour from a black-and-white photo alone, the only way for Frank to accurately recreate the true colour of any object on an image is to find a colour photo of the same object – or to research it. Sleeping it off: Tommies snatch a few minutes' shuteye during a well-deserved break from  front-line duty, watched by  men waiting to take their place. Soldiers could spend days in the forward trenches with barely a  wink of sleep . Up and at 'em! British soldiers  go into action, but the man in the foreground  has fallen before even leaving  the trench. Note the reinforced concrete bunkers in the background which have already suffered heavy artillery pounding . Iron monsters: Developed in secret by the Admiralty under Winston Churchill, tanks, or 'landships' as they were originally known, first saw action on the Somme in September  1916. This one, named  Iron Duke, is clanking through the city of Arras to spearhead the British offensive there in April 1917. They were hellishly hot for their crews and liable to break down, but tanks helped end the deadlock  of the trenches in 1918 . Survivors: Soldiers of the original British Expeditionary Force return from the bloody battle of Loos in September 1915. Loos was the last in  a series of failed British attacks that effectively destroyed the BEF and led to the firing of its commander, Sir John French, and the hiring of his successor, Sir Douglas Haig, who kept the job for the rest of the war despite being accused of senselessly sending millions of men to their deaths . Doomed? One of the most iconic images of the war shows soldiers of the Royal Irish Rifles waiting to join the offensive on the Somme on 1 July, 1916. There were 60,000 British casualties that day - almost 20,000 died. The battle continued until mid-November, but  no other day produced  such appalling losses . Since, for example, many uniforms from the war still survive it was simple enough for Frank to reproduce their exact shades. 'But if I can't source an original object I can often find a replica on the internet. I've even found items on eBay.' Some things, however, are simply left to the artist's instinct and Frank admits that 'there will always be an element of artistic licence in colourisation, but accuracy will always be striven for'. Because we're used to the blazing colours of modern photography, these pictures may look muted to us. But, says Frank, that perfectly suits the faded look of old photographs. 'Usually old black-and-white photos will have faded, so the colours need to be toned down to match.' But however muted the colours, the raw horror of war leaps out of these images for us all to see. Entente Cordiale: A Tommy befriends two French children in June 1916. Such images of the Franco-British alliance in action were useful propaganda but belied often edgy relations between soldiers and local civilians, who were accused of overcharging their defenders. The soldier belongs to the 15th Battalion, the London Regiment (Civil Service Rifles), a unit raised from civil servant volunteers in the capital . Horsebox to hell: British troops pose in a railway carriage  en route to the front in 1916. A sign on the sliding door on the right proclaims 'Hommes' and 'Chevaux': the men often had to share their transport with horses . Before disaster struck: Women workers stack live shells destined for the trenches at the huge munitions factory at Chilwell in Nottinghamshire in 1917. A few months later, on 1 July, 1918, 250 workers were killed when eight tons of TNT explosive at the factory blew up. Only 32 bodies could be positively identified . Girl power: As the war went on, more and more men left for the trenches. The gaps in the labour market were increasingly filled by women - like these female navvies pushing barrows of rubble - carrying out tasks previously only thought suitable for men .","Most WW1 imagery is black and white, but The Daily Mail has been given exclusive access to restored colour photos .

"By . Charlie Eccleshare . Levski Sofia have taken the extraordinary step of firing their goalkeeper, after his gaffes gifted Beroe Stara Zagora a 2-1 win in the Bulgarian league on Sunday. The inexperienced keeper, Stefano Kunchev, who is only 23 years old, was shown no mercy by the Sofia club. The club are one of the most popular in Bulgaria, along with CSKA Sofia, but the defeat left them just  a point above the relegation zone. Down and out: Stefano Kunchev was given the boot after making one mistake too many for Levski Sofia . Levski are notorious for their ruthlessness, and have changed managers so frequently over the last few years  that they make Roman Abramovich look like having the patience of a saint. In total, they have changed their head coach 14 times since 2008, with new boss Georgi Ivanov  replacing former Atletico Madrid and Celta Vigo manager Jose 'Pepe' Murcia earlier this month. It is Ivanov's second spell in charge of the side, and Sunday was the first game of his new reign. Goalkeepers around the world will be hoping that Kunchev's dismissal won't set a dangerous precedent - the likes of Joe Hart, Iker Casillas and David de Gea might all have been laid off in recent years if their clubs had borrowed Levski's trigger-happy approach.

Now, the Lawrences make savings of £8,000 per year on household bills.

The Lawrence family has sold their four-bedroom house for life on a narrowboat - because they could no longer afford the cost of living . After their home in Quinton, West Midlands (above), went under the hammer for £249,000, they moved on to the 65ft boat (pictured right), worth £80,000, in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire . Debra, mother to Jake, seven, and Phoebe, 12, who attend local schools, said: 'It was a big jump, but we were trapped and bored in our life. 'I didn't want the mortgage - it was a huge weight on our shoulders. The boat was our ticket to freedom.' Mrs Lawrence has even been stripped of her title as housewife and husband Duncan, 41, who was a lorry driver, has taken over the duties while she goes to work in a cafe.

But she admits it's not for everyone. She said: 'It's freezing in winter, and if you're the sort of person who likes their home comforts, you're not going to get along with living on a boat.' Mrs Lawrence, who admits she was 'a bit of a shopaholic', now has to share a wardrobe with her husband. She said: 'I've always been one to go out and buy clothes - I never liked wearing the same thing twice. 'But I've really had to cut down - there just isn't space for everything on the boat.' But the biggest economy of space has been shouldered by the children. She said: 'They now have to share a room, and that does make me feel guilty, but they don't seem to be suffering in any way.' In fact, the couple said life on the boat has made the family stronger. Mr Lawrence said: 'I was clocking up 60 hours a week on the road and I never got to spend any time with my wife and kids. 'Not . only that, but at the end of the month, when I'd paid all the bills, I . was ending up with nothing. 'I just got fed up with being a slave to the . wage and having no life.'

Insurance for the vessel is £360 per year and the biggest hit comes from the boat licensing fees at £860 . Mr . Lawrence, who earned £26,000 per year, said: 'I shelled out £1,600 in . electricity bills for two quarters. Unless I continued to put in the . hours, I knew I'd never be able to afford it.' Furthermore, the mortgage on their four-bed house in Quinton, West Midlands, was costing him £370 a month, along with a council tax bill of £2,000 a year and water bills at £190 per quarter. Then there was the insurance on two cars - a Volkswagen Beetle and a Nissan Qashqai at £800 per year. Now he's seen his bills drop from around £11,000 per year to £3,000. Mr Lawrence spends just £60 a month on diesel which propels the boat and provides central heating. Meanwhile electricity, which is powered by the generator, comes to around £50 a month.

The White House has denied rumors that President Obama was set to make a 'surprise' appearance on the Jimmy Kimmel Live show on Wednesday night. The President has been taking part in a fundraising drive on the West Coast and was due to pass through Los Angeles, where the show is recorded, tomorrow evening. Appearing on the light-hearted Kimmel show as two major world crises continue to worsen in both Gaza and Ukraine could have caused controversy for Obama. Having already appeared on TV with the likes of David Letterman and Jimmy Fallon, Obama's travel plans sparked speculation that he would feature for an hour slot on Kimmel's show. According to TMZ sources at the LAPD and ABC Network confirmed the rumors, saying that the President would film a special segment, a large part of which would be 'serious'. TV Guide shows that on Wednesday, Kimmel has a performance from Common scheduled, with no other guests listed. But the White House and a representative for the show later denied the President would feature. White House spokesman Josh Earnest told the LA Times: 'In advance of the trip, we've been in touch with Kimmel's folks about the president doing his show. 'We elected not to do it this time, but hope we can arrange to do it in the near future.' Obama has already been criticised for attending multiple fundraising events while on his visit to the West Coast, despite the escalating situation in both Gaza and Ukraine. Obama flies to fundraisers fro Democratic candidates in Seattle and San Fransisco on Tuesday before arriving in Los Angeles on Wednesday. There, he will attend local Democratic National Committee events scheduled for Wednesday night and Thursday and will also appear Thursday at Los Angeles Trade-Technical College. Fans of the show took to Twitter to discuss the news and some mocked Obama, with user Jonah Goldberg saying 'Unforeseen fundraiser get in the way?' and Jeannie Bondie adding: 'So just fundraisers, then?'.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Apple is said to be so confident its upcoming iPhone 6 will be a success, it is rumoured to have ordered 80 million handsets by the end of the year. If true, this would be the largest initial production run of iPhones – up from 60 million for the iPhone 5S and 5C last year. Suppliers claim the Californian firm has asked for between 70 and 80 million units combined for the rumoured 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhone 6s by 30 December. Scroll down for video . Suppliers claim Apple has ordered between 70 and 80 million units combined for its rumoured, upcoming 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhone 6s (leaked images pictured) by 30 December. The reports come after iPhone maker Foxconn confirmed it has hired 100,000 new workers to manufacture the gadgets . Synthetic sapphire is a hard, transparent material made of crystallising aluminium oxide, produced at high temperatures. As . the material is heated, it forms disks that can be sliced . using diamond-coated saws. These round disks are ground into shape, and . polished, to become glass. The technology is traditionally used in watch displays because it is thin, super-strong and scratch resistant. Apple already uses sapphire crystal in . the Touch ID fingerprint scanner on its latest iPhone 5S and to protects the phone's camera. As a result, sapphire glass could potentially replace Gorilla Glass currently used in most high-end smartphones. The reports come after iPhone maker Foxconn confirmed it has hired 100,000 new workers to manufacture the new gadgets. The 4.7-inch iPhone is . expected to go into production next week, with the larger 5.5inch version . set to start three weeks later. Apple has traditionally touted the benefits of smaller screens, and its devices typically have a 4-inch display. By increasing the size of its iPhone 6 handsets, Apple phones will be closer in size to those made by rival Samsung and HTC. Apple's larger screens are expected to use in-cell technology that will make the screens thinner and lighter by adding touch sensors to the liquid crystal . display. Current models have a separate touchscreen layer. Elsewhere, the 5.5-inch iPhone screen is expected to be made of sapphire crystal, rather than glass. Due to the complex nature of these screens, reports claim Apple could even ask component makers to prepare for 120 million displays, to account for any faults and replacements that need to be issued. The Economic Daily said earlier this week Foxconn finally confirmed the rumours it would hire a huge number of staff. The report appears to contradict earlier claims the larger 'phablet' sized iPhone 6 won't ship until 2015. This figure is up from 60 million for the iPhone 5S (pictured) and 5C last year. Apple has traditionally touted the benefits of smaller screens, and its devices typically have a 4-inch display. Increasing the size of its iPhone 6 handsets, Apple phones will be closer in size to those made by rival Samsung . Apple's iPhone 6 is rumoured to come in a slim 'Air' version. Up . until August last year, Huawei was the record-holder for the thinnest . phone in the world with its Ascend P6, at 0.24 inches (6.18 . millimetres). This was then replaced by the Vivo X3 at just 0.23 inches (5.75 millimetres). By . comparison, Apple’s current iPhone 5S has a depth of 0.3 inches (7.6 . millimetres), while the iPad Air is slightly thinner at 0.295 inches . (7.5 millimetres). Samsung's Galaxy S5 is 0.32 inches (8.1 millimetres) thick, while the HTC One M8 is 0.37 inches (9.4 millimetres). A . YouTube videomaker recently claimed to have acquired one of the sapphire screens - and has . subjected it to a barrage of abuse, from stabbing it with a knife and . keys to bending and twisting it. In the video, the screen emerges totally unscathed, raising hopes is could lead to a far more resilient handset from Apple. Marques . Brownlee, a popular YouTube host claims to have got the screen from . well known Apple leaker Sonny Dickson, who recently made his own video . showcasing the screen. In the video he can be seen bending and twisting the screen. 'I slowly realised there is absolutely no way I can break this display under my own power,' he said. 'The worst blemish on the surface was actually my fingerprint marks and the dust from handling it so much.'

"By . Gemma Mullin . Hundreds have paid £2 a time to use a private toll road built by a businessman who was fed up of waiting for the council to re-open a bypass. Mike Watts was among thousands of motorists faced with a 14-mile detour after a section of the A431 in Kelston, Somerset was cordoned off following a landslip. He spent £150,000 building the 400 yard unofficial road, which opened on Friday, and has already seen around 500 vehicles pass through the toll each day. Scroll down for video . More than 1,500 people have already paid £2 a time to use the private toll road in Kelston, Somerset . Mike Watts stands on the toll road he has built after the Kelston Road was shut in February following a landslip . He told MailOnline: ‘I have been involved in various businesses in my time but never have I had such a positive response. ‘People that are using it are happy to pay the toll – in fact, one man today drove down the road, paid his £2 then turned round and drove back through and said here’s a present for you. It was a bag of cakes for the toll operators.’ The new route, which has not yet received planning permission, allows motorist to avoid an hour-long diversion through country lanes. ‘It is such a relief for so many people and too many people were displaced by the road closure,’ he said. ‘Building a toll road is a big risk but we are confident that we can make the money back.’ The A431 near Bath which is closed as a private toll road has opened that avoids the closed section . Mike Watts at the Kelston Toll Road - the first privately run toll road to be built since cars became a familiar sight on British roads more than 100 years ago . That'll . be £2 please, sir: A driver pays up to avoid a 10-mile detour on the A4 . although the local council do not approve of the road which cuts . through an unused field . Mike Watts's toll road will be open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with toll operators there all the time . Mr Watts believes he will need to make £300,000 by the end of the year to cover the build of the road and its upkeep. ‘It . means we need about 1,000 cars a day but given the amount of interest . we’ve had and we haven’t even put the signs up yet, we are really . hopeful we can make that target, especially by the time the schools go . back.’ The land is being . rented from farmer John Dinham until Christmas and he has now applied . for retrospective permission for the 22ft-wide road. The . father-of-four said he is working very closely with Bath and North East . Somerset Council and the Highways Agency on the project. ‘The . leader of the council was here today with the group manager of the . Highways Agency and we had a wonderful meeting. They have gone away to . design the signs for the road to let people know the toll is open. Mr Watts says he has been overwhelmed by the positive response and has already had 1,500 use it . The Kelston toll road has been opened by local businessman Mike Watts, 62, who was fed up of an hour long detour caused by roadworks after just a few hundred yards of highway was cordoned off thanks to a landslip .

The toll road is the first privately owned to open for more than 100 years . ‘The relationship could not be better, they are very supportive and being really helpful. ‘They . watched as we built the road and they had their concerns but they saw . how professional it was and we were mindful of their repair works so we . are working together with them.’ The . 62-year-old has taken out public liability insurance and the Health and . Safety Executive has inspected the site to make sure it is on stable . ground. However, if an accident was to occur on the stretch of road motorists will be liable. He . said: ‘Your own car insurance would cover it in the same way that if . you had an accident in a private car park, such as a supermarket car . park, they have a disclaimer that you use this car park at your own . risk. ‘We have the disclaimer for those using our road.’ The booth on the toll road (left) only opened yesterday but has already managed to annoy the local council; drivers cam get a discount if they block book (right) Businessman Mike Watts decided to open the thoroughfare - made of a mix of asphalt and chippings . The A431 between Bristol and Bath was closed in February after a landslip caused cracks to appear in the road. Businesses . in the area soon began to suffer – including the cafe and party . supplies shop Mr Watts runs with his 52-year-old wife Wendy in Bath. ‘It . used to just be a very quick drive for us to Bath, but we were having . to do a 14-mile detour which was taking up to an hour down tiny lanes . just not designed to take the traffic,’ Mr Watts explained. Local . mother of two Laura Fenton, 28, said she was delighted with the road, . adding: ‘It was difficult getting kids around. If I wanted to take them . to a doctor’s appointment in Bath it was a huge diversion. I think what . Mike and the farmer have done is brilliant. It has already helped a lot . of people and I can see us using it a lot.’ But . a council spokesman said: ‘While we appreciate the difficulties . residents have experienced, it’s not just the planning, it’s the safety . and legal aspect of drivers using the road.’ He added: ‘Work has started . to deliver a solution as quickly as possible.’ A431 closed: Drivers can use the toll road at £2 a pop or use the A4, which entails a 10-mile detour .

"By . Harriet Hernando . A dog who has solved murder mysteries and put criminals behind bars is stepping down to make way for the next generation. Ellie, a 13-year-old springador - a Labrador Springer Spaniel cross - has worked on more than 1000 cases with West Midlands Fire Service as a fire investigation dog for the past seven years. She is trained to work out how fires started by using her advanced sense of smell to hunt for traces of the flammable liquids used to set buildings alight. Matt Dixon from West Midlands Fire Service with Ellie, a Labrador Springer Spaniel cross, who has helped the team solve cases for the past seven years . Suited and booted: Ellie wears protective footwear when she investigates a fire scene. But she's hanging up her helmet and retiring after seven year's service with the West Midlands fire squad . A new generation of fire investigation dogs are moving in and here West Midlands Fire Service handler Matt Dixon asks his dog to sniff out residues of fuel which may have been used to start a fire . And she’s been so successful she’s even put people behind bars for murder. Working with fire and police crime scene investigation teams she’s managed to sniff out evidence leading to criminal convictions and prevent insurance fraud by proving a fire was started deliberately. Her sense of smell is so strong that if you put a single drop of petrol at one end of a football pitch, Ellie would be able to smell it from the other end. Sometimes a trace of petrol is so small that bringing in Ellie is the only chance of finding that vital piece of evidence. Kai, who belongs to handler Matt Dixon from West Midlands Fire Service, searches a mock car crash in a practice session . Fire investigation dog Kai searches a mocked up fire scene for traces of where the blaze may have started . West Midlands Fire Service dog handler Matt Dixon and his dog Kai who helps sniff out evidence of how a fire started . But Ellie’s story didn’t have the happiest of starts. After being badly trained as a gun dog she was given away by owners who didn’t want her any more. She eventually found herself in the hands of a dog trainer who noticed her special skills and passed her onto the West Midlands Fire Service. Now at retirement age, Ellie has hung up her helmet and will live out her days at home with handler Matt Dixon, his wife Sarah, 37, and two children Thomas, nine, and Tabitha, three. The fire service won’t be left without a detective dog though, as Mr Dixon has trained Peppa, a five-year-old Pointer, and Kai, a 14-month-old Belgian Shepherd to carry on her work. Mr Dixon, from West Midlands Fire Service, said:‘It’s a pleasure to work with such a talented lovely-natured dog and I’m so proud of what she’s achieved. ‘We have done jobs where the evidence she has found has been instrumental in getting a conviction. ‘It’s always nice to know that criminals wouldn’t have been brought to justice without our work. ‘It is a fantastic feeling knowing that your dog has gone there, played a game, and the result of that is that someone dangerous was taken off the streets.’ In April 2013, Ellie was brought to a fire in Tyseley, Birmingham, to try and shed light on how the blaze had started. The owner of the house, Mohammed Inayat, claimed robbers had started the fire, in which his wife Naika died, and their three daughters were injured. Scene of the blaze: Home in Tyseley, Birmingham . When Ellie investigated the interior of the house she found evidence that the fire was started on purpose . But when Ellie found traces of flammable liquid at the property, police were able to work out the real cause of the blaze - Inayat. It transpired that Inayat had set fire to the family home in a bid to stop his daughet, Kalsoom Bibi, from moving to Dubai and marrying a policeman. He said she had brought ‘dishonour on the family’, because he did  not approve of her partner, before pouring gallons of petrol over his family home and setting it alight. When Kalsoom Bibi (pictured left), told her father Mohammed Inayat (right) she planned to move to Dubai, he doused his home in petrol . Naika died of carbon monoxide poisoning and one of his daughters, 16-year-old Saimah, who jumped from a bedroom window, suffered 50 per cent burns. He was found guilty at Birmingham Crown Court of murdering his wife and arson but was cleared of attempted murder of his three daughters. During his trial the court heard how the father-of-six soaked seven parts of his home in petrol at about 5am as his family slept - only hours before Miss Bibi, 28, was set to fly to Dubai to marry the CID officer. After initially telling police the fire was started by ‘a gang led by a white middle-aged woman’, he was convicted of murder and arson with intent and sentenced to life prison in October 2013.","Ellie has worked on more than 1000 cases .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . From freckles and blemishes to staring glass eyes, hyper-realistic models of early hominids are now providing an eerie way of coming face-to-face with our ancient ancestors and distant cousins. The sculptures as if like they could come to life at any second, thanks to the incredible attention to detail of ’palaeoartist’ Elisabeth Daynès. Having initially wanted to make masks for theatre, she became interested in human evolution over her 20 year career has recreated Lucy – the famed Australopithecus afarensis specimen that lived between three million and two million years ago - as well as a host of other hominids and Homo erectus. Hypnotic gaze: From freckles to staring glass eyes, hyper realistic models of early hominids give humans an eerie way of coming face-to-face with our 3million-year-old relatives. A model of Australopithecus africanus based on cast of the 2.1million to 2.7million-year-old skull STS5 discovered in South Africa is pictured . Elisabeth Daynès first examines the skull of a specimen to mark out distinctive features. She and her team make computer models of the skulls using 18 data points on the bone, which gives her an idea of muscles, the shape of a hominid’s nose, forehead and chin. She uses clay to mould the facial features across a cast taken from a skull. Examining other bones and teeth gives her an idea of other details and the creature's stature. Once the clay sculpture is complete, silicone cast is made, onto which all the tiny details can be painstakingly painted. She consults scientific experts and reports to decide on features such as eye and hair colour. Prosthetic eyes and teeth give life to the model and a mixture of human and yak hair is used for hominids.Each model takes months to make. Her work has been exhibited in museums across the world, which is informed by scientific research, brought to life by sculpting techniques in her Parisian studio. ‘I have a clear vocation – to reveal the secrets of ancient bones and evidence of the past. 'To give those distant beings their face, their identity, their humanity back,' she said. ‘I became obsessed with skulls. I wanted to give a face to every skull I saw. The goal wasn’t any longer to contribute to the making of a play or film, but to decipher the origins of mankind.’ Ms Daynès’ first challenge was to reconstruct a woolly mammoth and a group of Magdalenian people who lived around 11,000 years ago. Palaeoartist Elisabeth Daynès adds sculpts clay to form muscles and skin on top of a cast of a specimen's skull to make her models. This model is of a 18,000-year-old Homo floresiensis and its appearance is informed by cranial measurements marked with toothpicks (also pictured) Ms Daynès seeks to reveal the secrets of ancient bones and give ancient humans, such as this Homo sapien from Cop Blanc in France, their face, identity and humanity back . To make her models, which include the tiniest of details from wrinkles to goose pimples, she starts with a thorough examination of the specimen’s skull, which marks out many distinctive hominid groups. Ms Daynès and her team now make computer models of the skulls using 18 data points on the bone, which gives her an idea of muscles, the shape of a hominid’s nose, forehead and chin. She then uses clay to mould the facial features - informed by her research - across a cast taken from the skull in question, while examining extra bones and teeth give her more of an idea of the creature’s stature. ‘I always follow the same rigorous two-step protocol: First, I focus on highlighting the general features of the fossil group to which the skull belongs; then I reveal the particular traits of the subject,’ she said. To make her models she starts with a thorough examination of the specimen's skull, which marks out many distinctive hominid groups. A mixture of human and yak hair is used for hominids such as Paranthropus boisei, who lived in Eastern Africa during the Pleistocene epoch from about 2.3 to 1.2 million years ago .

She can then use these details to construct her model (pictured) Once the clay sculpture is complete, a silicone cast is made, onto which all the tiny details can be painstakingly painted, such as veins, wrinkles and spots. Eye prosthetics give the eerily realistic stare and dental prosthetics the sculptures’ toothy grins. It can be difficult to decide on exact details such as eye and hair colour, so Ms Daynès references scientific literature, which reveals that Neanderthals had red hair, among other findings. ‘Following the same approach as in a forensic investigation, I use the clues I find on the fossil to create an ID of the subject: fossil group, dating, age at death, probable sex, diseases, deficiencies, dietary pattern, associated fauna, climate, living conditions, environment, culture, etc. ‘I collect all these data in long discussions with experts, palaeopathologists, anthropologists and anatomists, to guide the decisions I make at each step of the reconstruction process, and to make sure my creations take into account the latest scientific developments. Ms Daynès uses human hair for members of the Homo genus, but mixes in yak hair for earlier hominds, as their hair is thought to have been much thicker and coarser. A model of one of the first specimens of Homo erectus, dubbed Peking Man is pictured, who lived between 700,000 and 200,000 years ago . 'I always follow the same rigorous two-step protocol: First, I focus on highlighting the general features of the fossil group to which the skull belongs; then I reveal the particular traits of the subject,' the sculptor said. An early stage model of 1.5million-year-old 'Turkana Boy' -  the most complete early human skeleton- is pictured . ‘Finally, I painstakingly implant the hair, beard, and body hair one by one.’ Ms Daynès uses human hair for members of the Homo genus, but mixes in yak hair for earlier hominids, as their hair is thought to have been much thicker and coarser. She said that every model is the ‘synthesis of all the knowledge on the origins of humankind’. ‘What I try to do is to provide an opportunity for the general public to come face to face with beings millions of years away from them, an encounter with a different kind of humanity.’ She works particularly hard on giving the models a gaze by adding wrinkles of expression and putting shade and light into the eyes until the subject is animated with emotion. Once the clay sculpture is complete, a silicone cast is made, onto which all the tiny details can be painstakingly painted, such as veins, wrinkles and spots. Eye prosthetics give the eerily realistic stare and dental prosthetics the sculptures' toothy grins. A storeroom of casts made of the models is pictured . Ms Daynès believes that prehistoric humans are too often associated with brutality, but she tries to capture their humanity. And it can be hard for her to say goodbye to her creations, which typically take months to make. ‘I spend so much time with those creatures, sharing such a close relationship with their bodies and faces that I tend to find them beautiful,’ she said. ‘A reconstruction project makes me enter into a relationship that resembles an act of love. When my sculptures go to a museum or an exhibition venue, I miss them acutely. I feel anxious for them and hope they are treated well.’","Palaeoartist Elisabeth Daynès uses clay and silicone to make the models .

"By . Mark Duell . This is the astonishing moment holidaymakers watched wild dolphins put on a show for them just yards away from a Cornish beach. Sunseekers in Gwithian, near St Ives in Cornwall, were amazed to see three dolphins leaping out of the water close to people swimming. Tourist Mary-Anne Drabble, 41, quickly took out her mobile phone to snap pictures of the cetaceans ducking and diving last Friday. Mrs Drabble, of Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire, said: ‘It was a breathtaking experience - I was actually crying at what I saw. 'Everyone on the beach was cheering as they jumped out of the water. I think the dolphins were showing off for everyone.’ Dolphins have been seen closer to the British coastline as sea temperatures soared to 21C (70F) over the weekend. Mrs Drabble said lifeguards eventually managed to encourage the dolphins away from swimmers, with the help of a helicopter. Scroll down for video . Impressive: Sunseekers in Gwithian, near St Ives in Cornwall, were amazed to see three dolphins leaping out of the water close to people swimming on Friday . Watching: Tourist Mary-Anne Drabble, 41, quickly took out her mobile phone to snap pictures of the cetaceans ducking and diving beneath the waves . Hot weather: Dolphins have been seen closer to the British coastline as sea temperatures soared to the 21C over the weekend . ¿Breathtaking¿: People on the beach in Cornwall were said to have been cheering as the dolphins jumped out of the water . Time to leave: Lifeguards urged people to stay away from the dolphins, before a helicopter was used to encourage them to swim back out into open water . Some 28 species of cetacean have been recorded in UK waters, with 11 of these regularly appearing, according to Government figures. Dolphins can be viewed from places such as Chanonry Point in the Moray Firth near Inverness, as well as Cardigan Bay in Wales. They can also be seen around Land's End in Cornwall from January to April, as well as on the east coast of Scotland between July and September. It is illegal under British law to intentionally kill or injure a dolphin, or ‘recklessly disturb’ one - for example to cause it distress by chasing it in a boat. Fishermen with larger vessels are obliged to fit acoustic deterrent devices to deter dolphins from approaching them, and reducing by-catch levels. They are also advised to reel in their lines if dolphins appear while fishing, before moving away from an area if the cetaceans do not leave first. Dolphins are powerful animals that can become aggressive towards humans, and it can be harmful for both parties if people attempt feeding. Two decades ago US officials had to issue guidance on this subject after people were seen in Florida feeding dolphins beer, hot dogs and sweets. It is recommended that people get no closer than 50 yards to dolphins, because they can feel harassed if you get too close to them. In addition, dolphins have delicate skin which is very sensitive to human touch and therefore can be at risk of harm from humans. Warmer sees could be behind a rise for a change in the type of dolphins spotted off the North East, a survey suggested four years ago. A rise in sightings of common, bottlenose and Risso's dolphins - associated with warmer waters - was reported by the North East Cetacean Project. Among the cetaceans whose numbers sighted off the UK have increased over the past 30 years are the common dolphin and striped dolphin.","Holidaymakers watch wild dolphins put on a show in Gwithian, near St Ives in Cornwall .

"By . James Rush . When the Vista Verde condo complex was first built one of its main selling points was its beautiful ocean views. Enjoying lunch on the balcony overlooking the California coastline was one of the biggest advantages of living at the Lomita complex. Now the sea views have been replaced with the sights of coffins and mourners crying after a nearby memorial park started carrying out burial services on a rooftop mausoleum just feet from the apartments. Scroll down for video . Residents at a condo complex in California have been left feeling 'upset and frustrated' after a nearby memorial park started carrying out burial services just feet from their apartments . Residents have now warned their properties could decrease in value following Green Hills Memorial Park's decision to move services to the site just 50ft from the complex. Resident Lane Mayhew, 26, told CBS Los Angeles: 'I've seen many funerals. 'They’ve brought the caskets up this way so everything comes up and down the ramp. It’s sad, it’s upsetting, it’s frustrating, it’s my home.' Matt Geier said when he first moved into the complex in 2006 he accepted that he could see and hear the services, which were then held at a distance. But he said his living conditions had changed drastically since the services had moved to just outside his apartment. He told the Daily Breeze: 'We’re sitting there eating brunch on the weekends and we have people right outside our window crying their eyes out.' Residents have now warned their properties could decrease in value following Green Bay Memorial Park's decision to start holding services on the rooftop mausoleum which lies just 50ft from some of their balconies . Ray Frew, president and CEO of Green Hills Memorial Park, told ABC7 Los Angeles that the mausoleum was built with the city's consent. He said he had 'never envisioned the level of negative response' from residents but had tried to reduce the noise of the services, put a limit on when services took place and attempted to hide the view from residents with screens. He said: 'A demand to make me stop doing funerals altogether in a cemetery, or to move a building that was constructed with full approval of the city that we are governed by, that's not a possibility.' According to WTSP.com, the memorial park has sent the residents a cease and desist letter, demanding they stop disrupting funeral services. Both parties will be attending the Rancho Palos Verdes Planning Commission meeting on August 12. Green Hills Memorial Park was founded in 1948 and has since held services for more than 75,000 families. According to its website, the memorial park started as a partnership between business owners and members of the local community. It still operates as a not-for-profit organisation.","Residents at complex complain after nearby memorial park starts carrying out funeral services just feet away from apartments .

Dan Tasker, group manager from the service, said: ‘We discovered that the woman’s son had lost the charger that came with the e-cigarette kit he had bought, so he had plugged it into a different USB charger and then gone out. ‘This then overheated and caught light to the bedding, and the fire then caused the canister to expand and explode.’ He added: ‘Plugs need to be appropriate for the device they are charging and not all can be transferred between devices. ‘The consequences of using the wrong charger with the wrong device can be devastating and we are extremely relieved that on this occasion no-one was harmed.’ It is the latest in a string of incidents in the UK involving the use of cheap or inappropriate chargers. In May, a Welsh woman was burned after her e-cigarette exploded when it was plugged into her phone charger and a barmaid in North Yorkshire was also injured earlier this year when a charging e-cigarette overheated. While . e-cigarettes can be susceptible to overheating due to the type of . battery they contain, Hampshire’s Trading Standards have stressed the . importance of using the right charger for all devices and raise . awareness of the dangers of cheap alternatives. A . spokesman from Hampshire County Council Trading Standards said: ‘The . message is do not buy cheap or unbranded chargers for use with . e-cigarettes, mobile phones or any other devices. They are invariably . dangerous and illegal. ‘At . the least, they are capable of destroying your device. At worst, they . have the potential to give a fatal electric shock or cause a very . serious house fire. ‘Our . officers regularly stop and destroy large quantities of unsafe chargers . as part of their work at ports. This is a widespread problem, with many . being sold through internet sellers. ‘Always make sure that the rated output of your charger is matched to the product you are charging.’ Electronic cigarettes are said to be 'susceptible to overheating due to the type of battery they contain'","Woman escaped unharmed after explosion at home in Ringwood, Hampshire .

"By . James  Nye . No your eyes are not deceiving you, that is a man water-skiing across a lake being towed by a plane. Flying at only 40-feet above the surface, the plane propels the intrepid extreme sportsman along at speeds of almost 60 mph. To make maters even more impressive, the water skier at Winter Haven, Florida is bare-footed - making the high speed of the plane a necessity. Scroll Down for Video . Terrifying: The expert water skier is being pulled along at speeds approaching 60mph by the sea plane . And, just to top things off, the bare-footed skier launches himself off a ramp, remaining airborne for a good couple of seconds before hitting the water having jettisoned the tow line. Only a select few at Winter Haven have even attempted this level of stunt, with Keith and Lauren St. Onge, David Small and Ben Groen of Team Devin Supertramp being among the elite club. Here we go! The skier flies off the ramp - letting go of the two rope before he lands in the waters at Winter Haven in Florida . Smooth: The skier glides across the waters as the plane drags him along at high speed . Another pass: The water skier finds himself approaching the ramp one more time being pulled along by the plane . Brave: Launching into the air for another leap into the unknown - injuries can easily happen with water skiing at this speed . The stress and strain of keeping your body gliding along the water barefooted is physically exahusting according to the skiers of Winter Haven because the boat, or in this case plane, has to travel at higher speeds than for normal water skiers. The discipline of barefooted water skiing was conceived by A.G. Hancock in the late 1940s and is considered the most dangerous form of the extreme sport.","Incredible stunt was performed by Team Devin Supertramp at Winter Haven, Florida ."

Each year it grows to accommodate our increasing dependence on the internet, and now an interactive map has plotted its blood vessel-like expansion over the last 25 years. Built by London-based Builtvisible, and based on data from TeleGeography, the map plots the development of 5,561,268 miles (8,949,994 km) of underwater cable. It begins with UK-France line in 1989 that stretches 96 miles (155km) from Brighton to Dieppe, and ends with the 9,260 mile-long (14,903km) Russian Optical Trans-Arctic Cable System, expected to launch towards the end of 2016.

Nowadays, cables . are protected using polyethylene. Traditionally the cables were owned by service providers, yet websites . have also started buying submarine cables to control their networks including Google and Facebook. Almost 95 per cent of the internet we use everyday is carried between countries through these fragile two-inch (50mm) thick lines. In 2006, submarine cables carried just one per cent of traffic - an increase of 94 per cent in just eight years, according to official figures from the International Cable Protection Committee. Since 2012, the number of submarine cables have almost doubled from 150 to 285. Of this 285, 263 cables are currently in use, while 22 are set to be in use by the end of 2015. When a cable is laid but not in use it is called a 'dark' cable, but once in use it becomes 'lit'. By 2017, the Builtvisible map reveals this number is expected to rise to 849. Cables on the map can be filtered by year, country and cable operator, which includes Google, Facebook and Vodafone. It shows active and planned submarine cable systems and their landing stations.

This image shows that by 2017, Google will have built 11 cables stretching 61,727 miles (99,340 km). The map shows active and planned submarine cable systems and their landing stations . The longest cable is called SEA-ME-WE 3 or South-East Asia - Middle East - Western Europe 3. It has 39 landing points (the average network has between 10 and 15) across Europe, Asia and Africa. It covers 24,000 miles and is run by France Telecom, China Telecom and Singtel. The Flores-Corbo Cable System is the shortest and connects the islands of Corval, Faial, Flores and Graciosa near Portugal. It covers 425 miles (685km) in the North Atlantic Ocean and is owned by Viatel. The total network covers in excess of 550,000 miles. In 2006, submarine cables carried just . one per cent of traffic, they now account for around 95 per cent. There are now 285 cables - 263 are in service and 22 are due to be in use by 2015. Many of the modern cables are made of fibre optic, to increase the size and speed at which the information can be sent, and are only two inches (50mm) thick. Trial cables were laid in 1842 in New .

Traditionally the cables were owned by service providers, yet websites . have also started buying submarine cables to control their networks. For . example, Google is part of the consortium that manages the Southeast . Asia-Japan cable, and Facebook is part of the consortium that manages . the Asia Pacific Gateway. Reports . in December stated that by owning private networks these companies can . stop governments from being able to track what they get up to. Back in the 1970s, Operation Ivy Bells was thought to have been the first underwater cable-tapping operation. It took place when copper wires, which radiate electromagnetic energy, were used to relay relatively small amounts of data that could be intercepted by fitting a recording device around the cable. 'At the time, the Soviets were so confident in the security of their line they left it completely unencrypted, enabling U.S. intelligence teams to simply record the transmissions, extract them from the seabed and listen to them at the end of each month,' explained Builtvisible. In modern cable systems, fibre optic cables use photons to transfer data. Modern tapping can be accomplished in one of two ways - either by splicing the cable and splitting the photon stream with a prism, or by bending the cable to a point where it begins to leak data. 'The documents leaked to The Guardian by Edward Snowden in 2012 revealed how British and American intelligence agencies had tapped more than 200 of these cables as part of an ongoing mass-collection spying project launched in 2008, completely undermining the privacy of ordinary citizens across the world,' continued Builtvisible. As of 2010, submarine cables link all the world's continents except Antarctica. East Africa was the last major region of the globe to connect to high-speed broadband, with the launch of SEACOM’s subsea cable system in 2009. Cables can be broken by fishing trawlers, anchors, earthquakes, turbidity currents, and even shark bites. If . cables need to fixed, a repair ship will drop a buoy in the location of . the break and a submersible is sent down to repair them.

In 2006, submarine cables carried just one per cent of traffic, this figure is now around 95 per cent . The cable system between Rockport, Maine and the islands of North Haven and Vinalhaven in the U.S experienced 45 faults over a 15-year period between 1990 and 2005, becoming known as the world’s worst performing system. Most of the faults were abrasions caused by tidal currents rubbing the cable across the rough and rocky sea bed. Ship’s anchors and fishing trawlers also caused their share of damage, hooking cables that were suspended above the sea bed. Some faults were also said to have been caused by repairs made on other parts of the cable. In December 2006, communications across Asia were severed when the Hengchun earthquake knocked out 80 per cent of the cables connecting Taiwan with the rest of the world. The breakages took out half of Hong Kong’s Internet capacity and cut China’s access to foreign websites. This image shows a cross section of a modern submarine communications cable.

"By . Mark Duell . and Richard Spillett . A payday loans firm sent more than 1,000 text messages demanding cash to a heavily indebted customer  after he had killed himself, it emerged today. Ian Jordan, 60, of Botley, Hampshire, had racked up more than £20,000 of debt to more than 12 firms over a year before he committed suicide. In one case he was being charged more than 5,000 per cent a year in interest for the cash he had borrowed. His daughter, Samantha Carr, and her family have now posted a video online in memory of him, which includes a heartfelt call on the Government to clamp down on payday loan firms. She said: 'Ian received 1,000 texts after his death. Some of them were demands for money. They pursued the family too.' Relatives were so tormented by the aggressive texts, they ripped the SIM card out of Ian's phone to make them stop. Scroll down for video . Suicide: Ian Jordan, 60, had racked up more than £20,000 of debt to more than 12 firms . The video features photos from Mr Jordan's life cut alongside the heartbreaking story of the events which led to his death. The poignant messages read: 'My daddy's rubbish at maths. That's why he trusted those payday loan companies. But soon he was really worried and embarrassed. 'He didn't talk to anybody about his debts, but I wish he had, because then I wouldn't have to go to his funeral two weeks before Christmas.' It ends with a call on the Prime Minister to tackle the companies which the family say brought about Mr Jordan's early death. The video concludes: 'Get rid of these stupid high interest rates Mr Cameron... now. So that no other person feels alone and desperate like my daddy.' Football fan and darts player Mr Jordan was found dead at his £130,000 semi-detached home one week after he was last seen. The alarm was raised by his doctor when he missed several appointments. Huge debts: In one case Mr Jordan was being charged more than 5,000 per cent each year in interest for the cash he borrowed . The tribute video is made with a poignant commentary on Mr Jordan's tragic last days as he worried about debt . He had written a note on his laptop which officers found when they entered his home. And today his family urged the authorities to do more to halt the number of people falling into the debt trap. Mr Jordan had been unemployed for years due to poor health and suffered with a hiatus hernia. He was then taken off Jobseeker's Allowance but the loan firms still continued to take the cash. Ms Carr told the Daily Mirror that the firms sent him more than 1,000 text messages after his death, demanding repayments be made. After hearing how Mr Jordan had overdosed on prescription drugs, Grahame Short, Coroner for Southampton and the New Forest, recorded a verdict of suicide last week. Mr Short said: ‘The note makes it clear that he wanted to end his life. I was not aware of the level of his debt until today.’ Speaking after the inquest, Ms Carr said: ‘He was borrowing money to pay off debts [which was] to pay off debts. 'The interest rate is one thing, the fact that you have already got this debt was another. It just spiralled out of control.' The video, which has been posted on YouTube, features photos of Mr Jordan throughout his life . The tribute video concludes with a message to the Prime Minister, calling on him to tackle payday loan firms . Inquest: Southampton Coroner's Court (pictured) heard that Mr Jordan was found dead at his £130,000 semi-detached home one week after he was last seen . Ms Carr added: 'They were just taking it out of his bank account. He had no money in the last few days of his life.’ Paying tribute to her father, Ms Carr described him as the ‘life and soul of the party’. But she said that her father’s tragic case showed how vital it was to clamp down on payday firms, adding: ‘Why do they still lend money to people when you have got debt? My main concern is to make sure that this doesn’t happen to anybody else.’ The inquest came as the Financial Conduct Authority revealed plans for a cap on the amount that payday lenders can charge their customers. It said rates should be capped at 0.8 per cent a day and added that no one will have to pay more than twice what they borrowed.","Ian Jordan racked up debt to 12+ firms over a year before taking his life .

Producers have installed alarms in the property that alert housemates to head for shelter - and they have already sounded twice within the first week of use, reported TMZ. Ran Telem, Keshet’s vice president of programming, said the decision to keep the show - which has a 45 per cent audience share of Israeli households - on air was ‘really debated’ before being made. He told the Hollywood Reporter: ‘The audience appreciates the break they get, so we try very hard despite the situation to keep it on the air. 'The contract we have with the viewers at home is that when there is a significant development, we return to the news telecast at once.’ But critics claim Keshet has only made the decision for profit at a time of crisis during the conflict, which has already claimed the lives of nearly 1,400 people, mostly civilians.

"By . James  Nye . The Obama administration believes there is a new leaker of compromising national security secrets who could potentially compound the embarrassment caused by NSA contractor Edward Snowden. The federal government has come to this conclusion after a new story was published on Tuesday morning by The Intercept, the site launched by Glenn Greenwald, the journalist who first brought the Snowden leaks to public attention. According to CNN, the proof lies in documents obtained for the article about US government surveillance of suspected terrorists which is dated from August 2013 - months after Snowden escaped first to Hong Kong and then to Russia to escape spying charges. Stunning leaks: Journalist Glenn Greenwald (left) has fanned the flames that he is working with a new source in addition to Edward Snowden (right) who infamously fed information on NSA spying to Greenwald and The Guardian newspaper last year . Indeed, Rio-based Greenwald, who left the Guardian last year to launch The Intercept with the backing of eBay founder, billionaire, Pierre Omidyar, has fanned the flames by suggesting there is indeed another leaker. The nightmare news for the Obama administration comes as a report in The Intercept highlights the one million names collected on the database called the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE). It claims that as part of this data, there is one watchlist called the Terrorist Screening Database which contains 680,000 names, of which only a fraction are Americans. However, it also claims that 40 percent of those on the list have no affiliation at all to terrorist groups. In . addition, the list has basically doubled since the underwear bomber . plot to destroy a Detroit-bound airliner on Christmas Day in 2009. Concern: President Barack Obama and his administration have become convinced there is a second source according to CNN . TIDE: The documents printe in The Intercept date from August 2013 - months after Snowden fled the United States . The justification for this is that the would-be bomber, Umar Farouk Abdulmuttalab was not on any watchlists at the time that could have had a chance of preventing the attack. A spokesperson for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined any comment on the CNN report on Tuesday. In addition to The Intercept's report, two recent article in the German press have reported on US national security and spying issues without citing Snowden - adding to the theory that the notorious whistleblower is not the only leak. 'That's particularly notable given that virtually every other article using Snowden documents - including der Spiegel - specifically identified him as the source,' Greenwald said in an email to The Hill last month.","Federal government convinced new leaker is supplying secrets to journalists .

"By . James  Nye . The NYPD went some way to restoring fraught community relations in Staten Island by taking part in a commemoration of sorts to Eric Garner - whose chokehold death earlier this month sparked massive condemnation of the force. At an impromptu memorial to the 43-year-old father-of-six at the Berry Houses annual basketball tournament, a player wearing a 'R.I.P Eric Garner' T-shirt leapt over a NYPD squad car and slam-dunked the hoop to set the crowd off into a fit of celebration. The cruiser rang out a whoop of its sirens and flashed its lights in appreciation, signaling a thawing in relations and a minor triumph for local community organizers and the NYPD who jointly organized the display. Scroll Down for Video . Success: The NYPD tweeted this picture of the triumphant slam dunk over a police are in Staten Island on Friday by a player wearing a 'R.I.P. Eric Garner' T-shirt . 'It was good for both sides,' said Under the Lights basketball league founder Joel Soto to the Staten Island Advance. 'The cops definitely wanted to use this as a way to get a good relationship between them and civilians, but besides that it felt real - they were just as into it as everyone else here.' Tensions have been high across the New York City borough following the death of Garner after an officer bound him in a chokehold when he verbally refused to be arrested - accusing the police of harassing him. The move is banned in all guideline manuals for the NYPD and in disturbing video of the incident Garner can be heard telling cops that physically cannot breathe before he lost consciousness and never woke up.

Described as the 'last stop at the bottom of the world' by some of its 6,000 or so hapless and homeless residents, Los Angeles' Skid Row is a grim circus of pimps, drug dealers, hustlers and prostitutes. For most of the men and women sleeping and wandering the downtown streets of the City of Angels the idea of divine intervention is as distant as the glimmering lights of Mullholland Drive and the Hollywood Hills. Their stories are easy to ignore, which is what inspired one documentary filmmaker to brave the violent, tent filled sidewalks to reveal life for what it is on the mean streets of America's second city. Scroll Down for Video . Inside public bathroom: This man is cooking up fake crack on a baby changing platform to sell to unwitting addicts who are too drug addled to know the difference and part with their cash . Having produced two prior films on the drug-addled addicts of Melbourne and Liberty City, Miami, Australian filmmaker, Shanks Rajendran decided to turn his attention to Skid Row in early 2013. However, his gonzo journalistic style almost landed him in trouble on his very first night filming. Sitting in his car with his camera, Rajendran, 28, was initiated immediately into the ways of the streets when around half-a-dozen guys stormed up to his car to demand why he was filming. 'They thought I was an undercover cop,' said Rajendran to MailOnline. 'They were screaming, 'You can't be doing that,' said the documentary maker. In video from his recently released documentary of his 18 months on Skid Row, Los Scandalous, the terrifying incident is played out in full. Watch Video Here: . Addiction: A heroin user shoots up to get his fix while sat on the streets of Skid Row in Los Angeles . Desperate: This man snorts some form of powdered drugs to get high while Shanks Rajendran filmed his documentary on the streets of downtown Los Angeles . Left behind: Needles used by addicts liter the streets of Skid Row - left behind by the drug users who spend all their money on narcotics . In the video, one man approaches the car, demonstrably calmer than the others and tells the filmmaker that he is being foolish. 'People are doing personal private things around here ... We got entrepreneurs and other things around here.' That mans name is Lavell Putman and with his help, Rajendran managed to talk down the irate men. 'I showed them my previous work and they came to believe that I was not a cop, but a genuine filmmaker,' said Rajendran to MailOnline. Dividing line: Even though downtown Los Angeles is rapidly gentrifying, Skid Row remains an oasis of poverty . Ominous start: Shanks Rajendran took it upon himself to travel to Skid Row and begin filming - much to the anger of these men approaching his car . Danger: The men stopped Rajendran from leaving and the situation was rapidly falling out of control . Help: Lavell Putman came to Shank Rajendran's (right) rescue and became his guide to the streets of Skid Row . From that day on, Putman became the Australian's personal guide through Skid Row, opening doors that would have taken weeks, if not months to open. With his checkered criminal history of robbery and being a former gang member, Putman had the necessary trust among the residents of Skid Row for Rajendran to film startling confessions and shocking snippets of drug taking and abuse. Some of the doors that Putman opened were quite literal. In one shocking episode from Los Scandalous, Putman and Rajendran walk up to a public toilet and knock on the door. Broad daylight: This man takes drugs using a banknote in daylight with no fear of the police arresting him . Fix: Once he had taken the drugs his face contorts as they take effect . Inside is a man sitting on the toilet cooking up what seems to be crack, but is in fact just bicarbonate of soda without any cocaine - fake crack. 'This man had people knocking on the door begging to buy what they believed was crack cocaine,' said Rajendran. 'The dealer said that they didn't know any better and that in their state, 'fake Gucci' might as well be 'real Gucci' and he was only there to make money from them. 'Fooling people and making money from the weak is what goes on on Skid Row.' Essential: Gangs operate on the streets of Skid Row, flaunting their weapons openly . Street life: People literally stop and sleep and congregate along the sidewalks of Skid Row with nowhere else to be . Dealing: Cocaine is prevalent in Skid Row and many dealers come from miles around to exploit the weak on the streets . Rocks: Crack cocaine is the most popular drug that is sold in Skid Row and lays waste to thousands of lives . Indeed, the reality of Skid Row is that not all of those on the streets are destitute. An entire economy has sprung up around abusing the addicts, with drug dealers coming from miles around to ply their trade along the streets. The police don't seem to care either said Rajendran, acting merely as peace-keepers and making sure the homeless don't stray into the more affluent areas of rapidly gentrifying downtown Los Angeles. 'When I first started my film I saw one man, who couldn't have been older than my father, begging for crack,' said Rajendran. 'He owed money and was about to be beaten up on the streets. 'It's a circus and not a good one at that.' Interference: Police make an arrest in Skid Row - which is unusual according to Shanks Rajendran - who told MailOnline they rarely interfere . Seeking to show the 'raw elements' of the streets of Skid Row and not trying to make a political film, Rajendrans visceral documentary is a chance he says for the people there to express themselves. No scene is more shocking than that of an elderly pimp and his similarly aged prostitute. 'I don't really like to call it pimping,' says the man. 'I am a player, and I take care of my girls and I look out for them, I have been doing this on and off for 20 years. 'But you know, its about doing it right. It ain't about beating up on females and mistreating them. 'You make sure you treat them like a lady.' Seeking permission to speak to the prostitute, her life is laid bare in shocking fashion by Rajendrans interview. 'I work real hard,' she says. 'It's really hard out here sometimes and I stay out here until I get enough money for a motel room, food and my drugs too. Pimp and his prostitute: One shocking episode of the documentary comes when an interview takes place between this pimp (left) and the woman who works for him (right) 'I have been doing this for 35-years.' Asked if her pimp is a 'good' player, the woman replies earnestly. 'Yes, he is supportive, he makes sure I have what I need to get out there and get sleep,' says the woman. 'You know, he is strict because he has to be otherwise I would spend all my money on drugs. 'He makes sure....I have my high heels, a clean dress, a clean change of underwear, condoms, he makes sure before we leave I have all that in my purse.' In an interview with LA Weekly, Rakendran calls Putman a 'hustler' and tells them that his guide has a bullet lodged in the back of his head which is slowly moving down into his spine. For his part, Putman believed that working on the documentary would be his ticket out of Skid Row. 'Being part of this documentary made me take a step back and look at the environment I've been so used to,' says Putman in a statement on the film's website. However, sadly, one week after filming stopped Putman was arrested and then arrested again. He is up for three felony charges, two counts of second-degree robbery and one count of assault with deadly weapon. For Rajendran though, this documentary is his attempt to show exactly what goes on the streets, hopefully opening peoples eyes to reality.

"By . James  Nye . and Kip Groesnick In Betton Hills, Florida . The Harvard-educated professor mysteriously shot dead inside his own home was found in the garage after being ambushed there, according to a Tallahassee Police Department report released on Friday. The heavily redacted report only adds to the mystery surrounding the death of Florida State University Professor Dan Markel, 41, who was found inside his locked home on Friday 18 July having been shot point-blank in the head. And police sources who have spoken to MailOnline today have indicated that they believe Markel did not necessarily know his killer, rather he was 'specifically targeted' for this murder - raising the possibility that the Cambridge educated law expert was the subject of a contract killing. Scroll down for video . Shot dead: Detectives say Florida State University law school professor Daniel Markel was shot in the head inside his garage at home in Tallahassee, Florida last Friday . The police report also reveals that Markel's 2008 black Honda Accord was not locked inside the garage, however, it does not indicate where in the garage the father-of-two's body was discovered. The incident report of the baffling murder notes the specific time that the report was taken and that evidence was collected from multiple locations. The four-page report is redacted, especially what he appeared to be doing before the incident and what type of gun was used in the shooting. The report also reveals that the shooting was reporting was first reported by a 72-year-old neighbor, who told the dispatcher he heard a loud bang emanating from Markel's home and then saw a car driving away, 'possibly white or silver'. Touota Prius seen nearby: The 72-year-old man who called 911 after hearing gunshots said that he saw a Toyota Prius driving away . The man 'further described the car as being small, clean and possibly a newer model,' the report said. He added the car was a Prius or a Prius-type of vehicle. Investigators have not speculated on the circumstances of Markel's death in an apparent attempt to withhold information that a guilty party would incriminate themselves with in the event of an arrest. Indeed, on Wednesday, the police in Florida's state capital released an image of a Toyota Prius and declared it a 'vehicle of interest'. And on Thursday it was announced that friends, colleagues and members of the public have managed to raise almost $50,000 in just three days for a prominent Harvard and Cambridge educated criminal law professor who was gunned down in his own home last Friday. So far, police appear to at a loss as to who was responsible for shooting 41-year-old Professor Dan Markel in the head at his affluent Betton Hills home in Florida last week. Tragedy: Ex-wife Wendi Adelson with the couples two sons. She also teaches at Florida State University and is said to be distraught at the death of her children's father . Separation: Dan Markel and his wife Wendi split two years ago and their divorce was finalized in July of 2013 . Tallahassee police say it is likely the Florida State University professor knew his killer because there were no signs of forced entry. The shooting of the popular lawyer has stunned friends, colleagues and residents of his well-to-do community in Florida's state capital. A fund was set up at the start of the week to benefit his sons Benjamin Amichai Markel and Lincoln Jonah Markel. Those close to him have spoken of how he loved his students, his colleagues, his friends, his scholarly work, and helping all those in need. 'Most of all, he loved his faith and his family. Ben and Lincoln were his heart. Danny will live every day in our hearts, and we must work together to ensure his most beloved little bears know how much their Abba was loved and what a great, wise, amazing man and father he was...and how much he loved them,' the site states. Intentional? Police are investigating the . possibility that Dan Markel was the subject of a targeted killing inside . his Tallahassee home on Friday morning . As the investigation gathers pace, police have not ruled out a contract killing and have issued a picture of a white Toyota Prius that was seen close to the crime scene. 'There’s not enough information to suggest that this is a contract murder. It certainly could be,' said ABC News consultant Brad Garrett, a former FBI agent. 'The most likely theory is that it it’s somebody that he knows.' However, with no suspects being named, the police are being careful not to reveal crucial evidence that they are hopeful the murderer will volunteer and incriminate themselves. 'We must make sure that we are keeping the integrity of this case so we can bring it to prosecution,' Northway said. Markel, 41, who is divorced from the mother of his two children, a day after the attack in his upscale Tallahassee neighborhood, as police revealed there were no signs of burglary or robbery and police have admitted they have no suspects so far. 'This is a puzzle and we need to get all of the pieces of the puzzle put together to bring this case to a close,' said Officer David Northway. Officers were first called to Markel's home at 11am last Friday after a neighbor reported hearing a loud bang coming from his home. He was found with a gunshot wound to his head, but died later in hospital from his injuries. 'It was not a robbery,' Northway said. 'It does not appear that it was a burglary. At this time, it does appear that Mr. Markel was unfortunately the intended victim in this case.' Markel was known as a strict disciplinary at Florida State University where he taught law and was known across the country for his writing featured in the New York Times and the Atlantic. Markel, a Toronto native, had just published a theory of retributive justice in the United States that applied elements of mercy, capital punishment, damages and shaming. He was the co-author of the book, 'Privilege or Punish: Criminal Justice and the Challenge of Family Ties' and he founded the popular law website, PrawfsBlawg. Murdered: The 41-year-old had no enemies . according to his friends who have been left bewildered and scared by . their friends death . His friend and colleague, Stepehen Valdeck of the American University said that Markel's 'devotion to scholarly enterprise' was his key. Vladeck said that 'Dan was  brilliant scholar and writer, but there are lots of law professors who fit those labels,' Vladeck wrote in an email to FoxNews.com. 'Whether that meant tirelessly reading and providing feedback on his friends' paper, organizing conferences where folks could present their ideas, or starting a blog where folks looking for an outlet could find a forum to develop and distribute their ideas, Dan cared about legal ideas, as such — even those that weren't his own.' Markel's own attorney said that it is physically beyond him to imagine how this has happened. 'He’s … by all accounts one of the most dedicated fathers anybody has ever known. And for this to happen to him, it’s just beyond repugnant,' said Stephen Webster, Professor Markel’s lawyer to The Globe and Mail. And the respected scholar's friends were equally distraught. 'It doesn’t make sense on any level. But at least the initial theory was that it was some kind of robbery gone wrong, which is awful, but at least makes sense,' said Michael McCann, a friend who teaches law at the University of New Hampshire. 'This has become a story that no longer makes sense. If, in fact, he was somehow targeted, I literally just cannot understand that.'","Florida State University professor, Dan Markel was shot point-blank inside his garage in Tallahassee on Friday .

"By . James  Nye . Well respected: Law professor Dan Markel' death has understandably stunned his close friends and family - shocked that the prominent scholar was shot dead in his home in a suspected 'targeted' killing . The chilling murder of Dan Markel in the upmarket Tallahassee suburb of Betton Hills has baffled police and stunned family and friends who claim the loving father-of-two had no enemies to speak of and had just begun a new relationship after a painful divorce. Shot at point blank range inside his own garage with the car keys still inside his black Honda Accord, the Harvard and Cambridge-educated law professor's death has left authorities struggling to comprehend who would want him dead. Indeed, just 36-hours before he met his killer, 41-year-old Markel's thoughts were firmly fixed on his most passionate cause, the death penalty, posting an essay on the subject to his legal blog.

In person and on his blog, he introduced many people to each other and created whole new communities,' said the professor to the Miami Herald. A strong opponent of the death penalty, he achieved national prominence and wrote for Slate and the New York Times. The scholar, who was buried in his hometown of Toronto on Thursday, had his critics though. According to the Miami Herald, . Markel was the subject of an anonymous threatening post, that taken out . of context can seem ominous, but in fact was only a small part of a . wider academic argument.

Described as a devoted father to his two sons, Benjamin, five and Lincoln, four, Markel was called 'Abba' by them, Hebrew for father. 'The house was like a playpen,' said one of his students, Ryan Wechsler to the Miami Herald. 'The living room was just for the kids. There were toys on the floor, crayon drawings all over the walls. You could tell he loved being a father.'

Touota Prius seen nearby: The 72-year-old man who called 911 after hearing gunshots said that he saw a Toyota Prius driving away . Markel's happy home was turned upside down in September 2012 when Adelson filed for divorce. As the case moved through the courts, Markel's attorney's claimed that their client was stunned and that Adelson had upped and left the home with their children while he was away for a short business trip. 'This abrupt and cruel departure shocked Mr. Markel, who, in a six-year marriage unmarked by any abuse, addiction or infidelity, was devoted to his wife and children,' his attorneys wrote. 'For six weeks, Ms. Adelson gave no correct information regarding where she lived with the children.' According to the Miami Herald, Adelson tried to move south from her job as a professor, also at Florida State University, to a private law firm. A judge denied this and their custody issues were still ongoing at the time of his death. For her part, Adelson, through her attorney's has spoken of her total and absolute shock at the death of her ex-husband.

"By . James  Nye . A California family are in mourning after the sudden death of an Oakland tech-engineer who collapsed riding his skateboard on Tuesday - just three weeks before the expected birth of his first child. According to witnesses, George Schnakenberg, 38, came off his board with no warning. He was then taken to San Francisco General Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. His pregnant wife, Joanne Chang called her husband 'the light of my life' and revealed that the couple are expecting a girl and that they are to name her Nova. Happy: George Schnakenberg and his wife, Joanne Chang, on their wedding day . Distraught, Chang told the San Francisco Chronicle that she felt 'lucky to have had' George in her life. 'His energy was infectious, his creativity was unbounded. George had more ideas than he had time to develop them all.' Several witnesses reported to investigators that Schnakenberg fell while riding and may have hit a parked car afterward. Hailing from Pittsburgh, Schnakenberg was the co-founder and design director of Sollega Inc., which produces solar equipment and solutions for large firms. Tragedy: Joanne Change is eight months pregnant and is expecting her daughter with George Schnakenberg in three weeks time . Relaxed: Joanne wrote that she will desperately miss her husband and that he had too many ideas in his head to act on . He worked in the design industry for almost 20-years and made products for a wide range of clients, such Nike and TiVo. His wife said that the greatest tragedy is that he will never see his daughter. 'I still cannot comprehend that the invention he was most proud of - his daughter - is one he will not get to see,' she said. In his spare time, Schnakenberg also worked at the Oakland consultancy, Infinite Collective, where he created several products, including an electric skateboard and bike. 'He was just very upbeat, positive, innovative, creative ... a hard worker, really smart, a great designer and just a very good person and good friend,' said Chang to the San Francisco Chronicle.

"By . James  Nye . Wikipedia has put a ten day total ban on edits made from computers within the US Congress after a series of changes on entries that promoted conspiracy theories or made humorous changes to notable people's profiles. Edits to the page of Lee Harvey Oswald claimed that he assassinated President John F Kennedy 'on behalf of the regime of Fidel Castro' and former US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfled is described as a 'lizard alien'. A representative from the Capitol building said that the ban was caused by the actions of 'two or three' and was drawn to attention by the Twitter account, @congressedits which automatically tweets page changes by IP address from within Congress. Banned: Computers of the US Congress have been banned from editing Wikipedia for ten days . The changes were brought to the attention of Wikipedia administrators when an edit was made from a House IP address for the website Mediaite, calling the media blog 'sexist' and 'transphobic' and alleging that it 'automatically assumes that someone is male without any evidence.' The website had written a story beforehand about the false edits coming from computers in the Capitol building. Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, told the BBC that he was far from shocked by the edits and that it has 'always gone and it always will.' However, he did say that the Twitter feed may have been responsible in part for some of the more outrageous edits. Assassin and lizard: Some of the edits accuse Cuban leader Fidel Castro of ordering the death of President John F Kennedy and former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld of being a 'lizard' 'There is a belief from some of the Wikipedia community that it only provoked someone - some prankster there in the office - to have an audience now for the pranks, and actually encouraged them rather than discouraged them.'

"By . James  Nye . Jurors convicted an Iowa man Thursday of killing his pregnant wife after his third time on trial, rejecting his claims that an unknown intruder shot her while he was in the shower. The jury found 23-year-old Seth Techel guilty of first-degree murder and nonconsensual termination of a human pregnancy. The former volunteer firefighter who had once hoped for a long career in law enforcement now faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole. Justice: Lisa Techel was killed by by her husband Seth Techel, 23, in May 2012 while she was sleeping in the mobile home they shared in Agency, near Ottumwa. She was five-months pregnant . Prosecutors argued that Techel killed 23-year-old Lisa Techel - who was five months pregnant - on May 26, 2012, so that he could be with a co-worker with whom he had been exchanging sexual text messages for months and for whom he had promised to leave his wife. They said Techel shot his wife in their trailer in Agency, a tiny town in rural southeastern Iowa. Lisa Techel, a county jail employee and reserve sheriff's deputy, was 17 weeks pregnant with their first child. Techel displayed no apparent emotion at the verdict, though his parents and grandfather hung their heads in the first row of the courtroom. Three trials: Seth Techel sits at a bond hearing in Albia, Iowa in April 2013. Techel, 23, was convicted of first-degree murder in the death of his wife, Lisa on Thursday . Lisa Techel's father, sheriff's deputy Todd Caldwell, wiped away tears after all 12 jurors said they agreed with the guilty verdicts. Techel is scheduled to be sentenced September 15. The texts . between Techel and Rachel McFarland, who worked together at a job . training center in Ottumwa, 'read like a countdown to Lisa Techel's . death,' Prosecutor Andrew Prosser had told jurors. He . said the messages in which Techel promised to leave his wife to be with . McFarland the day before the slaying gave him a powerful motive to kill . his high school sweetheart. Techel . had told police that he was in the shower that May morning when he . heard a gunshot, came out and saw his wife wounded in their bed. He is heard on the audio of 911 calls sobbing as he says, 'my wife's been shot' and requests an ambulance. His . lawyers had argued that was the emotion of a man who witnessed his wife . dying at the hands of an unknown intruder. Prosecutors suggested they . were fake tears. Jurors at two previous trials last year in Ottumwa and Mount Pleasant had been unable to reach a verdict. The . third trial was moved to the Scott County Courthouse in Davenport, . where relatives of the defendant and victim often packed the courtroom . during the nine-day proceeding. Jurors this time deliberated about four . hours over two days. Affairs: Jason Tinnes testifies during the first-degree murder trial of Seth Techel on Tuesday, July 22, 2014 in Davenport, Iowa. Tinnes admitted that he had an affair with murder victim Lisa Techel, but that he wasn't responsible for her May 2012 death . Seth Techel claims that he was in the shower when he heard a gunshot and ran down the hall to find his wife dead in their bed. His defense argues that his wife was most likely killed by a mentally ill neighbor who has since died. Techel has downplayed the significance of the text messages to the other woman, saying their relationship wasn't serious. Two trials last year ended with juries deadlocked and judges declaring mistrials. The first was held in Ottumwa, and the second was in Mount Pleasant. The third trial has been moved to Davenport, where the slaying has received little publicity. Techel and his one-time high school sweetheart were both beginning careers in law enforcement under the guidance of Todd Caldwell, Lisa's father and a veteran sheriff's deputy in Wapello County. In the dock: Seth Techel sits in a in Davenport, Iowa  courtroom on Tuesday, July 22, 2014 during his trial for first-degree murder . Denied: Judge Daniel Wilson denies defense motions to dismiss the charges or declare a mistrial at the first-degree murder trial of Seth Techel, on Tuesday, July 22, 2014 in Davenport, Iowa . Techel had started working as a county jailer; his wife was a reserve deputy who had interned with the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation. Caldwell had previously investigated the neighbor, Brian Tate, and warned deputies to use caution around him, given his mental illness. But he has said he is convinced that Seth Techel, whom he once considered a son, is guilty in his daughter's death. Having multiple trials in a murder case isn't that unusual, but it usually gives the prosecution an advantage, said Laurie Levenson, a former federal prosecutor and law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. Prosecutors can better prepare to counter the anticipated defense, while multiple trials ""can wear down the defense's resources and emotional energy,"" she said. 'While there is no guarantee of a conviction, 'third time is a charm' often applies in these cases,' she said.","Seth Techel, 23, convicted of killing wife Lisa Techel, 23, in May 2012 .

"By . James  Nye . Criminal charges were filed on Wednesday against a 32-year-old man accused of molesting a 19-year-old woman while she was asleep on an international Delta Air Lines flight from Detroit to Amsterdam. Janarol Dickens is accused of putting his hand down her underwear while placing her hand on his crotch while she slept on the flight on June 10, 2012.

According to the FBI, American the US District Court in Detroit can hear the charges because the aircraft the assault allegedly occurred on departed from the United States. According to an FBI affidavit, the 19-year-old Norwegian woman boarded the flight and began conversation with Dickens, who is an American citizen, but not from Michigan. Dickens allegedly asked the woman whether she wanted to watch a movie with him and she declined and fell asleep. When she awoke, Dickens allegedly had his hand down her pants, underneath her underwear and was 'rubbing' her private parts according to the Detroit Free Press. Interviewed: Dickens was questioned by Royal Dutch Police in Amsterdam but no arrest or charges were pressed . At the same time, he had placed the woman's hand on his erect penis, according to the FBI affidavit. She left her seat and went to the flight staff in tears and was so upset she was trembling. Upon arrival at Amsterdam airport, Dickens was interviewed by the Dutch Royal Military Police and denied any wrong doing. No further action was taken by the Dutch police. It was not until Dickens re-entered the United States two years later in Miami that the incident was flagged. He was interviewed by the FBI and admitted to being detained by the Dutch police for the matter and initially denied the accusations. However, the affidavit claims that he eventually admitted to putting his hand inside the woman's pants for 10 seconds, but not down her underwear. He also said the woman had not agreed to this. According to the FBI this amounts to crime because there was no permission granted for a sexual act.",Janarol Dickens allegedly abused the woman in June 2012 on a Delta flight from Detroit to Amsterdam .
"By . Josh Gardner . Diners at a Manhattan sushi destination known for its famous clientel discovered a roach infestation in the worst possible way: it fell right on top of them. Blue Ribbon Sushi in Soho was hit with an indoor rain storm of roaches Wednesday as several of the creepy-crawlies fell from the ceiling and onto a table and even patrons' legs. Luckily there have been no reports that high-profile fans of the posh Japanese joint like Gwyneth Paltrow, Faith Hill and Taylor Swift were around to see it. Famous fans: Taylor Swift and model Cara Delevigne are two of the celebrities pictured most recently leaving the Soho hot spot Blue Ribbon Sushi, where roaches reportedly rained down on customers Monday . Consciously unsettling: Gwyneth Paltrow and Faith Hill have also been spotted lunching at the Soho sushi hot spot where several roaches tumbled down on customers from above . According to the New York Observer, a male diner was lunching at Blue Ribbon when a critter tumbled down onto his table. Four more roaches followed suit, with one evening landing on his leg. 'These weren’t small cockroaches,' he told the Observer. 'A person from the restaurant said, ""Maybe it’s about to rain, this hasn’t happened before.”' While none of the bugs fell directly onto food, another diner reportedly had one crawl right onto his leg. A customer said that five roaches rained down from the ceiling on Monday at the hip eatery . The Observer source said proprietors only comped half the patrons' food bills. Eric Bromberg, who co-owns the restaunt and several others carrying the Blue Ribbon name, says the issue has been resolved. 'Once we knew we had an issue, we scheduled our exterminator to come that day, as soon as possible, and we waged war. 'After many hours we found the source — located next door — and rectified the issue. The entire restaurant has been thoroughly searched and cleaned and we are moving ahead with service as usual.' Not a refund? No roaches landed on any of the unique sushi or sashimi creations and proprietors, who say the problem has been fixed, gave diners half off .","Blue Ribbon Sushi in Soho is a hot spot for celebrities like Gwyneth Paltrow, Cara Delevigne and Taylor Swift .

"By . James  Nye . A courtroom in Cincinnati witnessed extraordinary scenes on Friday when a bereaved father publicly forgave the young woman who had killed his 21-year-old son in a hit and run accident. So emotionally fraught was the moment Bill Walker absolved Lauren Balint, 23, for striking  Chris Walker in February of last year, that the judge admitted she almost broke down in tears ahead of her verdict. With his wife next to him and Balint stood only six feet away, Walker told her that she was 'totally forgiven. I hope you get married and have a good, long life.' Scroll Down for Video . Tragedy: Bill Walker with his son Christopher and wife, Mary, in this picture taken before the 21-year-old student's tragic death . As Walker fought back his own tears, Balint stood listening and raised her hands to her face and began to weep as the dad continued. Emotional: Lauren Balint, (seen here in her mugshot, following her arrest in February 2013) was forgiven by the Walker family for the death of their son, Christopher . 'From the bottom of my heart, I forgive you. I wish Chris hadn't been out there that night because it affected your life as well,' Walker said. According to Cincinnati.com, Walker believed that forgiveness was the best gift he could bestow on Balint as she stared down the barrel of a three-year sentence for failing to stop after an accident. Indeed, Hamilton County Common Pleas Court Judge Melba Marsh said that she had not decided what sentence to impose on Balint, who had earlier pleaded no contest to the charges following her arrest for striking Chris Walker when he drunkenly stumbled onto I-71. 'It almost brought me to tears,' said Judge Melba Marsh. Indeed, as Bill Walker, a pastor at his local church spoke, his words apparently cemented Judge Marsh's decision not to sentence Balint to a custodial sentence. 'There was no reason for two lives to be lost,' he said. 'We already lost one. We can't change what happened to Chris.' Marsh sentenced Balint to two-years probation for the incident last year which led to the death of Chris Walker, eight days after his 21st birthday . Devastated: Bill and Mary Walker told the young lady who killed their son by accident that she was forgiven . He was struck by Balint's car at 2am on February 24, when the University of Cincinnati architecture student mistook a country road for the interstate. His father believes his son, an avid urban explorer, was returning from an abandoned railway tunnel under William Howard Taft Road. He had been drinking. Balint struck the student and instead of stopping carried on at the insistence of her friends inside the car. 'You are totally forgiven. I hope you get married and have a good, long life.' Forgiving Bill Walker to Lauren Balint in court on Friday . 'It was a very bad decision. It was very overwhelming,' Balint said in court last week. 'I should have stopped. I think about it all the time.' Discovered dead at the scene, the police investigation led back to Balint, who was arrested. 'Chris made some mistakes that night,' his father said according to Cincinnati.com. 'It's so ironic, because he promised he'd never drink and drive, and he . was killed walking because he didn't want to hurt anyone else.' Balint . has been seeking counseling in the aftermath of the accident and she . wasn't charged with Chris Walker's death at the time of her arrest . because he was drunk. Wrong turn: Christopher Walker was an avid urban explorer and was struck on I-71 in February of 2013 . Balint's attorny, Bryan Perkins said that Walker's parents stunned his client. 'I sympathize with him as a father,' he said. 'I've never seen it at that magnitude. It got me emotional, for sure.' For Bill Walker, though, it wasn't about punishment. It was about peace. 'It's not for me to have her carry this guilt for the rest of her life,' Walker said. 'She seemed like a neat young lady, so I hope it helps.'","Pastor Bill Walker stood up in court in Cincinnati and faced the woman who killed his 21-year-old son, Chris .

"By . A. Greg . After a 17-hour air and ground search, an 18-year-old Michigan girl missing since Thursday has been found alive and delivered to police. Hayley Turner was 40 miles from home when she was seen jumping out of a moving vehicle in Ecorse by an unidentified woman. A homeowner found her sitting near West Outer Drive and East 19th Street, shirtless around 2:30pm today. Questions: It's unclear what transpired between the time Hayley Turner (left) went missing and her discovery 17 hours later 40 miles from home . Turner was on the phone with a friend saying she had come across a man in a ditch and was going to check on him when he produced a gun and the call was disconnected . According to Click on Detroit, Turner gave the homeowner her mother's cell phone number before the homeowner drove her to the Ecorse Police Department. Police believed Turner may have been abducted when she disappeared after a phone conversations with a friend that was cut off. Turner had gone to a local video store to rent some movies and spoke to her friend as she headed home around 10pm. A rental receipt would show that the Notre Dame Academy student had rented Muppets Most Wanted and Divergent. Employees would later tell the authorities that she was happy and smiling. On her drive home, she told her friend that she had spotted a man lying in a ditch and that she was going to check on him. Mystery: The 18-year-old was found without her shirt sitting outside a house in Ecorse . Sighting: A young woman fitting Hayley's (pictured second right) description was seen walking with a Caucasian male near the Telegraph and Erie Road near the Erie VFW . In an emotional press conference, mother Christy Turner begged for any word of her daughter's whereabouts . 'Seconds later, Hayley told her friend ""he has a gun"" and the phone was disconnected,' Monroe County Sheriff Dale Malone related to reporters at a news conference. According to Bedford Now, the unidentified friend called her father, who sped to the scene only to find his daughter's car running but empty, her iPad missing but her wallet still there. The ensuing search utilized dogs, helicopters, and even enlisted FBI agents. A potential suspect could be a white male described in a call to authorities Friday morning. Normal night: Turner went to get some DVDs from this local store but disappeared after telling her friend she'd seen a man with a gun . 'The male was described as a white male, 18-24 years old, wearing brown khaki shorts and a blue shirt. The female was described as 18-24 with a red shirt, long, black, tight-fitting pants and shoulder-length dark hair. This is very similar to Hayley’s description and what she was last seen wearing,' Malone told reporters. As she waited for word, mother Christy Turner was understandably desperate for information, pleading with the public for any word of her daughter's whereabouts. 'Hayley, please call. Call anybody,' Turner begged during a press conference. 'We miss you. We want you home.' She was taken to a local hospital, reportedly with minor injuries, but police declined to say whether she'd been assaulted.

"By . A. Greg . A disgraced former investment banker who pleaded guilty to insider trading has begged the judge for a lenient sentence in a Manhattan court, saying he only stole to help support his love child. Frank 'Perk' Hixon, Jr, 55, who is due to be sentenced Friday, told the judge that his ex-girlfriend and mother of his daughter was 'too proud' to accept money - but apparently happily accepted investment advice. A lawyer for Hixon, who has been married for 26 years to Marguerite Lammot Lee, wrote in a letter to Judge Ronnie Abrams that his client's crimes were committed out of love for his illegitimate daughter, and not greed. Stolen heart: Former senior managing director at Evercore Group Frank Perkins Hixon Jr. (pictured in April) is asking for a lenient sentence because he says he stole for love not greed . Hixon's crimes 'pale in comparison to the pervasive, calculated and economically-driven conduct of defendants such as Raj Rajaratnam,' William F. Johnson argued. Hixon was also charged with using inside information to trade in his father's account. Prosecutors are asking for 46-to-57 months in prison, reports the New York Post. He was a managing director at Evercore until January when he was fired following his arrest. He pleaded guilty to five counts of securities fraud and one count of making false statements to federal agents for crimes that occurred between October 2011 and January 2013. Hixon claims the mother of his daughter, Destiny Robinson, would not accept his child support checks for their daughter who was born in 2008, but she was happy to receive investment advice. He . committed the fraud in a misguided attempt to remain in contact with his . daughter, who was conceived during a two-year extramarital . relationship, reports Bloomberg. 'Her pride would allow her to accept his investment ideas, but not his checks,' Johnson said in the court filing. Indiscretion: Hixon's daughter from his two-year affair with Destiny Robinson was born in 2008 . So he set up an account in her name and used his inside knowledge to make trades on her behalf. When he was arrested, there was almost $1 million in the account, reports the New York Post. 'Mr. Hixon’s actions were a misguided expression of love and support for his younger daughter, whom he desperately feared losing,' Johnson argued. Despite is indiscretions and illegal activity, Hixon's wife says she wants to move forward with her husband. 'I know that Perk deeply regrets the actions that have brought him before you, and that he is embarked on the hard work necessary to rectify them,' Lee wrote in to Judge Abrams, adding that a lenghthy prison sentence would prevent the couple of 26 years from being able to 'heal.'","Frank 'Perk' Hixon, Jr, 55, pleaded guilty to insider trading and will be sentenced Friday .

"By . Joshua Gardner . Finally brought to justice? Robert Honsch was arrested in Ohio Tuesday, where he lived under a new name with a new family. His old wife and daughter were murdered in 1995 and only 19 years later have police found their suspect . A perplexing investigation into the murder of an Upstate New York mother and daughter that spans three other states and nearly two decades may finally have a resolution. Police on Tuesday arrested Robert Honsch for the 1995 murders of his daughter Elizabeth, 17, and wife Marcia. He'd been living in Ohio under the assumed name Robert Tyree along with a new wife and children. Elizabeth's body was found wrapped in plastic bags and a sleeping bag near a New Britain, Connecticut shopping center. The body of her mother, 53, was found by a hiker a week earlier near a Massachusetts park. Both died from a gunshot wound to the head. Police . say the case never officially went cold, but a phone call made last . month from Virginia Beach to police in New York became the linchpin that . allowed investigators to finally move forward in the 19-year-old case. The . mysterious tip was a missing persons report to New York authorities . that came nearly 20 years too late for reasons police will not reveal. 'This . has been an intensive investigation, it has never stopped,' New Britain . Police Chief James Wardell told the Hartford Courant. 'We don't give up . on any case. It does not matter how old the case is.' The . tip, which police revealed came from a family member, finally allowed . them to put a name to the bodies of Elizabeth and Marcia. Until now they had gone unidentified. Neither . body had identifying information, but examination of clothing and other . items found at the scenes suggested they were from New York. Slain: Elizabeth, 17, was discovered wrapped in plastic bags and a sleeping bag behind a New Britain, Connecticut shopping center in 1995. Her mother, Honsch's 53-year-old wife Marcia, was found dead a week earlier in Massachusetts. Both suffered gunshot wounds to the head . Troopers . began a missing-persons investigation into the disappearance of a . mother and daughter from the New York City suburb of Brewster, and . collaboration with authorities in Massachusetts and Connecticut . determined their identities.

Authorities said examination of items found near Elizabeth Honsch’s body connected him to the scene. New Britain, Connecticut, police said Wednesday they and Massachusetts State Police have separate arrest warrants charging Honsch with murder. He was being held in Wooster, Ohio, and is expected to be arraigned there Thursday before being moved to Massachusetts.

"By . Joshua Gardner . Unlike on Earth, rolling down a window to air out a foul odor is not an option in the vacuum of space. So, for the last nearly 40 years, NASA has employed a master smeller to sniff out foul odors before they make life unbearable for our intrepid astronauts. Meet George Aldrich of the White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico, who puts his highly-trained nose to everything from lab items to personal keepsakes that could bake in the atmosphere-free heat of space to become shockingly stinky. 'I actually use my sense of smell to help protect the astronauts from obnoxious odors in space,' Aldrich told odditycentral.com. 'I feel like I’m a bodyguard for the astronauts.' Tougher than it looks: George Aldrich has been smelling things that NASA intends to take into space for nearly 40 years . There was even an instance in earlier days of space exploration when a Russian mission was actually aborted early because of an unbearable stench. One reason objects are so stinky in space is the 90-minute night/day cycle, notes Wired. Every hour and a half, the cabin is in very hot daylight that causes objects to off-gas potentially offensive fumes. For some of his 'missions,' Aldrich and his team of sniffers basically bake samples of what's being taken into space in an oven for days to mimic space's harsh conditions. Space stench: In space, even something as simple as a watch can turn from innocent object to malodorous menace in the 90-minute day to night cycle of outer space where temperatures cause serious off-gassing . Overwhelming: A Russian mission was once aborted a month before it was scheduled to end because a smell became so overwhelming to cosmonauts . Then they smell them. A sample of the air around the sample is sucked into a syringe and then plunged into a face mask. 'I’ll-take-the-bullet type thing, before you are actually subjected to it,' he said. Even after all these years, Aldrich can still be surprised by how profoundly the conditions of space can turn a simple thing like newspaper ink into a malodorous menace. 'In my mind, I'm not really expecting them to be that bad,' he once told Wired. 'I guess what you worry about more than anything else is the stinky or pungent one, where it bites or burns up your nose. That's not pleasant.' No one can hear you gag: Thanks to Aldrich's intrepid nose, missions on the space station can expect a fresh scent, or at least fresher than it could be. Space is notoriously stinky for astronauts, thanks to the enclosed atmosphere of the cabin, and even space itself is said to smell like scorched metal .","Aldrich has been sniffing every object astronauts take to space at White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico for nearly 40 years .

"By . Joshua Gardner . A Virginia minor facing child pornography charges says that police, not satisfied with photos they've already taken of his genitalia for evidence, want to photograph him in a state of arousal--by force, if necessary. Manassas high school student Trey Simms, 17, was charged with manufacturing and distributing child porn in January. Police say he sent his 15-year-old girlfriend an explicit video of himself. Now Simms faces potential jail time and a lifetime on sex offender lists. And sooner than that, the teen's lawyer says authorities want to force him to become aroused using a drug injection. Sexual offense? Trey Simms, pictured, says police took pictures of his genitals in January when he was charged with distributing child porn after trading explicit photos with his 15-year-old girlfriend . NBC Washington reports the trouble started when Simms was exchanging texts with his then-girlfriend in January. The mother of the girl, who was 15 at the time, complained to police, who soon confiscated Simms' iPhone and iPad. But that evidence wasn't enough for Manassas City police, according to the teen's aunt Stacy Bigley. 'He said they took him to a room and took pictures of his genitalia,' a tearful Bigley NBC Washington. She also said her nephew tried to refuse initially. 'They told him if he did not they would do it by force.' That was months ago. This week, Simms' defense attorney Jessica Harbeson Foster said authorities want even more evidence with which to try their case and aren't afraid to use force this time, either. According to the Washington Post, Foster claims the prosecution now wants photos of Simms' genitals in a state of arousal, too. Unfairly targeted? Trey's aunt Stacy Bigley (right) says police took photos of her nephew's genitals to compare with the alleged pornography and that now they want to take things even further . When she asked how they intended to get such photos, Foster said the prosecutor told her: 'We just take him down to the hospital, give him a shot and then take the pictures that we need.' A magistrate signed off to allow a second warrant for such a search, which Foster plans to fight. 'This is a 17-year-old who goes to school every day, plays football, has never been in trouble with the law before. Now he’s saddled with two felonies and the implication that he’s a sexual predator,' she told the Post. 'I don’t want him to go through that. Taking him down to the hospital so he can get an erection in front of all those cops, that’s traumatizing.' Foster is also demanding to know why Simms is the only minor in the case being, which involves two of them sending photos, who's being charged. 'From what I gather, there’s no intention to charge and this was handled inefficiently,' she said. Simms is due back in court July 15.

"By . Joshua Gardner . A New York City woman was glad to be alive Wednesday after managing to walk away with just minor cuts when a jackhammer chisel flew through a gym window and struck her as she exercised. Robin Cocking, 59, was working out at Manhattan's Asphalt Green when the 10-pound metal bit crashed through two panes of glass and cut her as she lay shocked on a gym mat. The shocking freak accident now has residents in the area fuming now that the source of the bit has been traced next door, to the construction site of a controversial garbage depot next door to the Upper East Side rec center. Scroll down for video . Shocker: Robin Cocking was exercising at the Asphalt Green in Manhattan Wednesday when a 10-pound jackhammer chisel smashed through the window and nearly impaled her . Dangerous: The huge metal spike left a spattering of shattered glass across the floor of Asphalt Green where Cocking was exercising . 'I saw this thing come through the glass. I thought: if it’s breaking the glass it has to be heavy metal, and sharp,' Cocking, a database administrator at Asphalt Green, told the New York Post. When Cocking heard the glass shatter, she had the fast foresight to move out of the way. 'Thank God she rolled left, because the jackhammer chisel landed right where she was and would have impaled her,' said Kelly-Mimmo-Guengher, who works with Pledge 2 Protect community group, which exists in opposition to the East 91st Street Marine Transfer Station. The Marine Transfer Station was proposed by then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg in 2006 as part of a move to make Manhattan more responsible for its own trash. Critics have said from the beginning that the station is a poor fit for the largely residential area.

'There are 34,000 children who use Asphalt Green every year': A view from the gym shows where many children play in the Asphalt Green field . Powerful: Two panes of safety glass were shattered, leaving employees to believe the chisel had shot through at seriously high velocity .

There . are 34,000 children who use Asphalt Green every year.' Tweedy claims she and other asphalt green officials have documented several safety issues with the nearby construction site. Cocking was lucky to get away with only a few cuts. 'I only suffered minor cuts on my right hand, right foot and on my left arm,' she told DNAinfo. 'My hands are still shaking. I think I'm still shocked.' The city temporarily shut down all work at the construction site while they did an investigation.

"By . A. Greg . Mitt Romney has used a social media platform to share pictures of a recent family vacation he and his wife Ann took with five of their 22 grandchildren. The Romney clan undertook what the former presidential candidate describes as a 'family tradition' of hiking through the American West. 'My Mom and Dad began the tradition, showing their grandchildren the majesty of our country and teaching them about the sacrifices and character of the pioneers,' Romney wrote. Team Romney: Ann and Mitt Romney with five of their grandchildren on a recent hiking holiday . Adventurous: The family hiked 50 miles on their educational trip through the American West . Along the way, he says, the Romneys taught their newest members a bit about their ancestry and their ties to the settlement of the American West, Romney wrote on Medium. However, the Romneys got more than they bargained for, Mitt Romney writes in the short entry, with a close encounter with a a rattle snake and some 'unexpected obstacles.' As the millionaire Mormon posted his family's bonding adventure, a new poll placed him ahead of President Obama in a hypothetical re-run of the 2012 election. Romney is clearly enjoying his family life and the two-time presidential candidate has consistently stated that he is not considering a third run. Family tradition: Mitt Romney wrote that his parents took his children on the same trip and now he and Ann are taking their grandchildren . Imparting wisdom: Romney wanted to show his grandchildren the 'majesty of our country' and teach them about 'the sacrifices and character of the pioneers' Family time: Romney has consistently denied he'll run in 2016, although a recent poll showed he'd win if the 2012 elections were held today . According to the CNN/ORC International poll, the businessman would take 53 per cent of the popular vote to Obama's 44 per cent. But he'd lose to Hillary Clinton by 13 points, the poll found. Now, with the primaries less than a year-and-a-half away, Romney's name is still being bandied about and there's evidence that he still has a loyal following in some parts of the country. And Romney himself showed politics are never far from his mind. As he and his grandchildren enjoyed such imaginatively named sites as Goblin Valley, Spooky Gulch, Peekaboo Slot Canyon and Rainbow Arch, the sobering events in the Ukraine and Israel were brought into perspective. 'As we experienced the grandeur of the West, our hearts went out to those millions in the world who suffer.'","Mitt Romney and his wife Ann took five of their grandchildren on a hiking trip through the American West .

"By . A. Greg . She's already been censored by the Motion Picture Association of America for a poster advertising the upcoming Sin City: A Dame to Kill For, and now Eva Green's appearance in a trailer for the same film has been deemed too risque for ABC. The problem is a sheer white nightgown the sultry French actress is wearing in the poster and trailer, which ABC says makes Green 'appear to be naked.' For the MPAA, the 'curve of under breast' proved too much for the American public. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Modified: The poster (left) that was rejected by the MPAA for visible 'curve of under breast' was modified to be less risque (right) Trailer: ABC won't air the trailer until two scenes featuring Green in a white robe have been removed . The organization argued that the almost-visible nipple and the outline of Green's naked breast amounted to nudity. The filmmakers compromised and the poster, featuring Green wearing a sheer white robe with a pistol in her hand, has been modified so that the gown is less transparent. ABC, a source told Page Six, rejected the trailer for the film, which also stars Josh Brolin and Jessica Alba, because Green appears to be naked in the gown. The filmmakers were told to remove the footage of Green in the white robe if they want the network to air the trailer. By contrast, action films' advertising regularly features the movie's star aiming a gun or committing an act of violence. Sex and violence: Green doesn't understand what all the fuss over a breast is when violence is so freely depicted in the media . Green seems bemused by the reaction the sexy poster has provoked. 'You have so many more violent things in the movie business ... this is kind of soft. I’m not naked. It’s suggested. I find [it] really sexy,' she told vanity Fair. In 2011, the Los Angeles Times named the former Bond girl number 18 on their 50 Most Beautiful Women in Film list.

"By . Associated Press . and Lydia Warren . Personal emails sent by the wife of former Virginia governor Bob McDonnell to a businessman who lavished the couple with expensive gifts have been read out in court during their corruption trial. The luxury goods he allegedly gave them - including a $7,000 engraved Rolex watch and images of the McDonnells riding the millionaire's Ferrari - were also shown to the jury. On Friday, defense attorneys took aim at Jonnie Williams' testimony that his relationship with former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell and his wife was all about business - saying that the former CEO texted or called the first lady more than 1,200 times over the course of nearly two years. Among the messages read in court, a particularly racy one Maureen McDonnell sent him the day an earthquake hit Virginia read: 'I just felt the EARTH MOVE AND I WASN'T HAVING SEX!!!!' Questions: Businessman Jonnie Williams, seen leaving court Thursday, claimed he only had a professional relationship with former Gov. Bob McDonnell and his wife - but their texts show otherwise . Disgraced: If found guilty, McDonnell, pictured on Thursday, could spend decades behind bars . Accused: Former Virginia first lady Maureen McDonnell, left, heads into the Federal courthouse in Richmond with lawyer Heather Martin on Thursday for her and her husband's corruption trial . The McDonnells are charged in a . 14-count federal indictment with taking more than $165,000 in gifts and . loans from Williams in exchange for their help promoting his company's . products, primarily the dietary supplement Anatabloc. If convicted, they . could face decades in prison. Williams, who is testifying for a third day, has said his relationship with the McDonnells was about benefiting his business, not friendship. Williams testified on Thursday that he did not have a romantic relationship with former Governor Bob McDonnell's wife, Maureen. A defense attorney had said earlier this week that Maureen McDonnell, her marriage with her frequently absent husband on the rocks, had developed a crush on Williams and that the former Star Scientific Inc. CEO had deceived her into believing he cared for her. The relationship began when Williams . met the McDonnells in New York following the election and Maureen needed a dress for the inauguration - and he offered to buy her one.

They . later went on a luxury shopping spree, where he bought her $20,000 . worth of designer dresses and accessories from Bergdorf Goodman, Louis . Vuitton and Oscar de la Renta. A . month later, she allegedly told him she could help him with his . business if he helped their financial situation, all with her husband's knowledge, Williams testified. In court, Williams detailed a pattern of . requests for gifts by Maureen McDonnell and a $20,000 loan former . Governor Bob McDonnell asked for, along with several events to promote . Anatabloc the couple attended - including the product's official launch . at the governor's mansion. Williams said he handed out eight $25,000 checks to medical researchers at that event 'to prime the pump' for what he hoped would be state-sponsored clinical trials of Anatabloc. He also talked about his discussions with the governor about transferring some Star Scientific stock to McDonnell so he could borrow against it. Williams said he wanted to keep the deal secret because he knew it was wrong, and McDonnell went along. 'It could be violating laws. I don't know that. It could be,' he said. He said he ultimately concluded he . could not make the transfer without reporting it to federal regulators, . so he just made a $50,000 loan instead. Gifts: Williams also bought a Rolex that Maureen McDonnell then gave to her husband as a Christmas gift. This image of McDonnell wearing the watch was later sent by text to Jonnie Williams . Luxury: The Rolex cost nearly $7,000 and was engraved with: 'Robert F. McDonnell, 71st Governor of Virginia' Generosity: A check among the evidence for the trial shows a $15,000 check made out by Williams' company to the catering company who provided food for McDonnell's daughter's wedding . Helping hand: Caitlin McDonnell is seen at her 2011 wedding - which Williams helped pay for . Williams also wrote the . family a check for $15,000 for their daughter's wedding catering and . gave them yacht rentals and use of his private plane. Among other gifts was an engraved Rolex watch he said Maureen requested and then gave to her husband for Christmas in 2012. 'It . was a bad decision on my part to buy that watch when she asked for it,' Williams said. 'I shouldn't have had to buy things like that to get the . help I needed.' The watch was passed to the jury, where each juror briefly inspected it as a silent courtroom watched. Maureen . McDonnell also admired Williams' Ferrari and asked if anything like . that would be available at his lake house, where the McDonnell family . was planning to spend a vacation. Williams said no. 'She said, ""It would be nice. We never get to do things like this"",' Williams testified. He had the car delivered and the jury was shown photos of Bob McDonnell driving the sports car. Friendly: Jonnie Williams and Maureen McDonnell are pictured together at a NASCAR reception in 2011 . Acquaintance: Williams, pictured with Maureen at the same event, denied that he was friends with the couple - although the hundreds of emails and texts suggest otherwise, the defense team said .

"By . Lydia Warren . It took paramedics 19 minutes to reach the Florida State University professor who was fatally shot outside his home after a misunderstanding on the 911 call, it has emerged. Dan Markel, 41, was shot as he drove his car to his garage in Tallahassee on Friday July 18. The gunman - who has still not been identified - shot once through the car window, striking him in the jaw. A neighbor noticed the car on the driveway and, concerned about a recent spate of break-ins in the area, decided to check it out. After discovering the professor in a pool of blood, he called 911. 'He's inside [the car],' he said. 'I don't know if somebody tried to shoot him or if he shot himself or what. I don't know... You need to send an ambulance in a hurry. He's still alive. He’s moving.' Scroll down for 911 call audio . Victim: Florida State University law professor Dan Markel was shot dead in his Tallahassee, Florida garage on July 18 but it took an ambulance 19 minutes to reach him after confusion on the call .

[The EMT] is not going to come until we figure out what’s going on, but . they are on the way as well, OK?' the dispatcher said. The neighbor responded: 'They better be if this guy's got a shot at living.' On the 911 call, confusion can also be heard as one EMS unit was replaced by another and as the dispatcher urged police to go. ABC reported that the average wait time for ambulances in the area is just nine minutes. Clue? A 72-year-old man who called 911 after hearing gunshots said that he saw a Toyota Prius driving away .

Authorities have increased the reward in the case to $10,000. There are no suspects so far, even though police believe Markel was targeted.

"By . Lydia Warren . A high school's new principal - who was named Principal of the Year in his former job - has resigned after being involved in two drunk-driving crashes in one night. Just two weeks before he was due to start at Milton High School in Milton, Georgia, 37-year-old Nathan Buhl was captured looking battered and bruised in two mug shots from different counties. He was arrested twice on charges including hit and run, DUI, reckless driving and failure to report striking an object following the crashes on Saturday night - and after three nights in two different jails, he resigned from his new job on Wednesday. On Saturday, he had left a home in north Forsyth County about 9.42pm when he allegedly hit a parked car with his own car. The owner saw the accident and called deputies with the tag number. Scroll down for video . Busted: Two mug shots from two different Georgia counties show Nathan Buhl after he was arrested for DUI crashes on Saturday night. The high school principal said he could not remember the accidents . When deputies in Forsyth ran the plate, they learned it was from Cherokee County and when they called the sheriff's office, an investigator confirmed there had been another wreck with the same vehicle, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Authorities had found Buhl's . car off the road and lying on the driver's side door between two trees. A tire was missing and there were car parts . and debris strewn all over two lawns, CBS46 reported. Firefighters cut away the windshield to pull a bruised Buhl out of his smashed Chrysler 200. He miraculously only suffered cuts and bruises. Glen Edseth, whose parked car was hit in Forsyth County in the first wreck, said he . ran outside Edseth when he heard the collision and saw Buhl driving erratically through his . neighborhood. Respected: Buhl had been named Principal of the Year and was 2 weeks away from a new role . 'I suppose he probably didn't have any idea what he . was doing,' Edseth said. Deputies from both Forsyth County and Cherokee County caught up with Buhl when he was taken to hospital for treatment and he was arrested on Sunday when he was released. Authorities said Buhl admitted to drinking before getting behind the wheel but he was not sure how many drinks he had had - and could not recall the two accidents. A breathalyzer test showed his blood alcohol level was 0.193. The legal limit for Georgia is 0.08. He was booked into the Forsyth County jail, where he . was later released after posting $8,525 bond. There he was charged with DUI, hit and run, failure to report striking an object and failure to maintain lane. After being released, he then surrendered to the Cherokee County jail. He was released from this second jail on Tuesday after posting $3,551 bond. In Cherokee, he was charged with DUI, reckless driving, weaving and operating an unsafe vehicle. He resigned and sent an apologetic email to colleagues and parents on Wednesday. 'I am humbled and ashamed after making the worst decisions of my life Saturday night,' he wrote. 'A night of celebration quickly turned to nightmare because of the series of poor choices that I made.' He wrote that he had to reflect on what had led him to make the bad decision and said he was aware he could have killed someone. Resignation: After spending three nights in jail, Buhl stepped down from the new role at Milton High School in Fulton, Georgia. He said he was 'humbled and ashamed' by his bad choices . He added: 'Teenagers wrestle with the same kind of . choices I faced Saturday night on a regular basis. How can I stand . before them and tell them to do what I say, not what I did?' The Fulton County Schools superintendent said he was 'disappointed' to hear about the charges. 'But [I] believe he has done . the right thing by stepping down as principal,' Superintendent Robert . Avossa said. 'He is taking full responsibility . for his actions and their consequences, and this sends the right message . to the students and community we serve.' Buhl, who is married, was named principal at Milton High School in April and he was due to take over at the start of the term in two weeks. An interim principal has been assigned until a new one can be found. He had previously served as the principal of Crabapple Middle School, where he was named the 2013-2014 Principal of the Year by the North Fulton PTA Council, NorthFulton.com reported.","Nathan Buhl, 37, smashed into a vehicle and then drove off in Fulton County, Georgia on Saturday night .

"By . Lydia Warren . and Associated Press . A mother has been charged with child neglect after she let her seven-year-old son walk to a nearby park alone. Nicole Gainey, 34, of Port St. Lucie, Florida was arrested on Saturday after lifeguards saw her son Dominic walking past a pool on the way to the park, which is half a mile from his home. When they questioned the boy, who has a learning disability, he ran toward the park, where officers picked him up and drove him home. Arrest: Nicole Gainey, left, was arrested on Saturday for allowing her seven-year-old son Dominic, right, to go to a nearby park unsupervised. Strangers who saw him walking alone called the police . Gainey said she was shocked when officers turned up on her doorstep and told them that she allows her son to go to the park unsupervised once or twice a week. She said the park is about 10 minutes away and she always sends him off with a cell phone so that she can contact him or he can get in touch with her in case there's a problem. 'I honestly didn't think I was doing anything wrong. I was letting him go play,' she told WPTV. 'I'm totally dumbfounded by this whole situation.' Police said in their police report that there were 'numerous sex offenders living in the vicinity' - but Gainey said she felt her son was mature enough to walk to the park alone. Gainey was arrested on Saturday but was released later that day from the St. Lucie County Jail after posting a $3,750 bond. Shock: Gainey said she thought he son was mature enough to walk the half a mile to play in the park . Scene: She said she let her son go to the park once or twice a week and always sent him with a cell phone .

Attorney John Whitehead of the Rutherford Institute, a Virginia-based civil liberties group representing Gainey, says his client is a good mother who is scared but ready to fight the charge. But WPTV said it might not be necessary as an official from the Florida Department of Children and Families told the mother she could 'expect the case to be dropped'. Gainey said she will no longer let her son go to the park on his own because she is worried about being arrested again.

"By . Lydia Warren . and Mail Online Reporter . A Kansas foster father who mistakenly left a 10-month-old baby girl to die in his hot car has been charged with first-degree murder. Seth Jackson's lawyer said that the felony charge was far too strict for his client, who only remembered the baby was inside the car two hours later when something on TV jogged his memory. 'Rather high for a mistake,' attorney John Stang told NBC of the murder charge, which carries a life sentence with a minimum of 20 years in prison. 'I'm not trying to say it's not a horrible loss. The death of a child is an awful thing. But this person is looking at 15 more years than someone who was driving drunk and ran into a car and killed someone.' Scroll down for video . Charged: Seth Jackson, pictured left with his . partner Payton Schroeder, has been charged with murder after forgetting . about their 10-month-old foster child and leaving her in a hot car to . die . Stang added: 'He is grieving for the child. He knows he made a mistake and he accepts responsibility for the mistake. He knows because of his actions, Kadillak is dead.' But Sedgwick County District Attorney Marc Bennett said the charge was warranted because the child died because of an inherently dangerous felony, aggravated endangering of a child. Jackson, 29, was arrested after he found the baby - known as Anna to the new family and Kadillak to her biological relatives - inside his silver Dodge Charger and called emergency services. Baby Kadillak was being cared for by Jackson and his partner Payton Schroeder, 26, who are parents to two adopted boys, aged five and seven. They had cared for the girl for most of her life. Devastated: Jackson's mother is pictured with little Kadillak - known to the foster family as Anna . Loving: The couple have two adopted sons and three foster children. They had been trying to adopt Anna . Jackson had collected her from daycare last Thursday but left her in the car with the windows rolled up as he went inside his home with his five-year-old son - as temperatures reached 95 degrees. When he . ran outside to get the girl, he found he unresponsive. Emergency . dispatchers got a call at 6.41pm, and the girl was pronounced dead a few . minutes later. Seth Jackson's mother . One of . the foster parents was 'hysterically crying' outside the house before they were both taken in by police for questioning, witnesses said. Jackson and his partner had been trying to adopt the 10-month-old girl they had cared for nearly all her life. They also had three other foster children, ages three, five and 18; and had two adopted children, ages five and seven. The two younger foster children were visiting other relatives at the time. Police have said both foster parents were distraught over what happened. Tragic: The girl had been inside this Dodge Charger for more than two hours before she was found . Shocked: Neighbors hug in disbelief near the parked car where a 10-month-old Wichita girl died . Jackson's mother Dottie told NBC that she spoke to her son at 2am Friday. 'He wants to die,' she said. 'Seth's children - that's his life.' The little girl's biological grandmother Cindy Poe, drove to Wichita to try and discover how the tragedy had occurred. 'Accidents . do happen. We don't know if it was accident,' she told NBC station KSN. 'They have a lot of kids they take care of. I want answers.' The couple's adoptive children were taken into protective custody. A neighbor said the men were devoted parents. 'They . are two of the most kind-hearted guys that I have ever met. And I hate . that there's so much controversy right now with babies being left in the . car, because I truly don't feel from the bottom of my heart they would . ever do this on purpose,' Lindey TenEyck, who lives across the street, . told NBC. Devastated: Jackson's mother Dottie said that her son 'wants to die' after the unimaginable tragedy . Distraught: The girl's biological grandmother, Cindy Poe, said she wants to hold her one last time . Both the prosecution and the defense agree the circumstances are entirely different than a widely publicized case in Georgia, where a father is charged with murder and child cruelty charges on suspicion of intentionally leaving the 22-month-old boy in a hot car last month as he went to work. Bennett said this Kansas case is not charged as an intentional murder. 'No one is alleging, it is not charged that he did this intentionally,' Bennett said of the Kansas case. 'We are not intimating, as authorities in Georgia have, there was some plot or anything like that. It is a different charging theory and a different charging authority in Kansas than what appears to be in Georgia.' Jackson' partner, Schroeder, has not been charged. He was already home . when Jackson came in and assumed he'd brought the baby in, according to police reports. Like an Oven: After just 60 minutes, temperatures inside a car left out in 90-degree heat can feel like more than 130 degrees.

"By . Lydia Warren . Missing student Holly Bobo was filmed tied up and crying before her suspected murderer raped her, according to a witness who claims she saw the footage. Sandra King testified at a preliminary hearing on Tuesday that Jeffrey Pearcy, who has been charged with accessory after the fact and tampering with evidence, showed her the cell phone video. After King's testimony at the court in Lexington, Kentucky, the case against Pearcy was sent to the grand jury as the judge deemed there to be enough evidence against him, WMC reported . King said that Pearcy showed her the video and that Zachary Adams, who has been charged with murdering and kidnapping the 20-year-old in 2011, was also in the footage. Revelations: Witness Sandra King testified at a preliminary hearing on Tuesday that she saw missing student Holly Bobo tied up and crying in cell phone footage shown to her by Jeffrey Pearcy . 'I seen a woman that was tied up that was crying,' King told the court. 'She was blonde... It looked like Holly Bobo.' She said that Pearcy told her his brother Mark Pearcy - who has also been charged in the case - had taken the video of Adams raping the student, USA Today reported. King said she did not see the sexual assault. 'I knew what he was fixing to do. I did not want to see,' King said. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation has also not seen the video. Jeffrey Pearcy has denied the video exists and agents are now trying to find out if it is on his cell phone. But King testified that they had worked with her to trick Pearcy in to acknowledging the existence of the video on a phone call. Where is she? Holly Bobo, 20, vanished from her home in 2011 but her body has never been found . 'I . said to him, ""You know that video of Holly, if it would have been you . in that video, I would have watched it,"" and he said, ""Yes I know"",' King said. Speaking outside the court after the hearing, Pearcy said he couldn't hear what King was saying over the phone because he was driving with the windows down. He has previously claimed he never met Holly, doesn't know her family and hasn't met the two men charged with her kidnapping and murder, Zach Adams and Jason Autry. His brother Mark faces the same charges and is awaiting a preliminary hearing. He was also . charged with failing to register as a sex offender and unlawful . possession of a weapon. According to online records, Mark Pearcy . registered as a sex offender in 2000 for statutory rape. Both men have pleaded not guilty. Tampering with evidence is a Class C Felony and accessory after the fact is a Class E Felony. Denial: Pearcy, pictured outside court on Tuesday, has been charged with with accessory after the fact and tampering with evidence for the video - but he denies such footage exists . Charged: Zachary Adams, left, and Jason Wayne Autry, right, are suspected of kidnapping and killing Bobo . Bobo was abducted from outside her home in Darden on the morning of April 13, 2011. Her brother told investigators he saw a man in camouflage walking her into the woods. Adams was indicted in March on charges of especially aggravated kidnapping and first-degree murder. Another man, Adams' longtime friend Jason Wayne Autry, was indicted in April on first-degree murder and especially aggravated kidnapping charges. TBI director Mark Gwyn previously said the agency has sworn statements from witnesses who claim to have seen Bobo alive with Autry and Adams after she had been reported missing. Her body has never been found. See below for video .","A witness testified at a preliminary hearing on Tuesday that she had seen footage of Bobo tied up and crying after she was kidnapped in 2011 .

"By . Lydia Warren . Second trial: 23-year-old Daniel Floyd's murder conviction was overturned on a technicality . A man who was found guilty of shooting dead a rival over a gambling dispute has had his conviction overturned because his mother couldn't find a seat during jury selection, according to reports. The bizarre ruling means that Daniel Floyd, 23, who was sentenced to 15 years to life in prison for killing Leon Hill, a young dad, in Brooklyn, New York in March 2008, is about to start a second trial. His conviction was overturned by the Court of Appeals on the technicality in April 2013. The court ruled that because his mother, 41-year-old Melissa Floyd, was unable to find a seat in the courtroom, a . retrial was needed because it could not be deemed a public trial, the New York Post reported. It said that Floyd's mother 'has an . absolute right to be present' and defendants 'have an absolute right to . a ""public trial"".' Overcrowding meant that the courtroom had been closed. 'This violation... requires a new trial,' the judges ruled, the Post reported. Jurors who had convicted Floyd were shocked. 'What . difference would it have made to the jury selection if she had been in . the courtroom?' one male juror asked. The mother of the victim, Linda Dixon Hill, told the Post that the overturned verdict was 'frustrating'. Floyd was previously convicted of shooting her son Leon, whose daughter was just four months old at the time, in March 2008. Support: The conviction was overturned because his mother, Melissa Floyd (pictured), could not get a seat during jury selection because of overcrowding. Judges ruled that it was therefore not an open, public trial . The two men had been arguing about money in a dice game before Floyd left the room and returned with a gun 20 minutes later, according to court papers. He allegedly shot Hill in the neck, killing him. Floyd was in court on Monday for a pre-retrial hearing and his mother attended - getting a seat this time. She did not comment as she left the court. He will be back in court on September 12. He has remained incarcerated despite his conviction being thrown out.","Daniel Floyd was found guilty of shooting Leon Hill in the neck over a gambling dispute in Brooklyn, New York in 2008 .

"By . Lydia Warren . The teenager whose insurance company refused to pay for dentures after he lost his teeth beating two different types of cancer now has the money to pay for them thanks to the kindness of strangers. Alex Hunter, 16, raised the $11,000 he needs through his gofundme page in just 20 hours, so touched were the public by his story. Alex, from Delano, California, made the tough decision to get his 19 remaining teeth removed two weeks ago after years of radiation left them fragile and impossible to use. While his insurance - which is provided by the state because of his mother's job working for Bakersfield - covered part of the procedure to remove the teeth, it would not cover the dentures, his family said. 'They say it's not a medical issue but they know they took out the teeth because of a medical issue,' his grandmother, Roberta Hunter, told MailOnline earlier on Tuesday. 'It feels like the insurance is just bailing out on him.' Fighter: Alex Hunter, 16, has had all of his teeth removed after battling cancer twice -and his insurance company declined to cover his dentures because it is not a medical issue . Now the teenager, who loves to sing and one day hopes to be a counselor, will be able to go ahead and get his dentures fitted. Alex's family, who have never asked for anything throughout Alex's 11 years of treatments launched their gofundme page, Alex Hunter's Medical Fund, only yesterday in the hope of raising the money. By Tuesday afternoon, when the MailOnline first published Alex's story, the fund stood at $1,000, but in a little less than six hours had smashed through its target. The family is also applying for funds through various charitable foundations - anything that can help Alex get back his smile. Goal reached: Alex Hunter's gofundme page has managed to raise the $11,000 he needs to have dentures fitted after his insurance company declined to pay for them . On the mend: Alex was first diganosed with cancer when he was four and overcame it, before being diagnosed again when he was 13. His family is now hopeful that he is cancer-free for the second time . 'He doesn't smile because his teeth were never attractive,' his grandmother said earlier about the brave teen. 'He was anxious to get them out and get it over with but now we're waiting to see what's next.' Inspiration: Despite his health struggles, Alex is a top student who dreams of becoming a counselor . Alex was just four when he was first diagnosed with a rare type of cancer, Embryonal Parameningeal Rhabdomyosarcoma, after a mass started growing in his cheek. He underwent aggressive chemotherapy and stayed in hospital for months as he battled the side effects of the radiation. He lost vision in his left eye and feeling on the left side of his face. He was also left with a thin frame, teeth problems and thyroid gland issues, but in July 2003, doctors said he was cancer-free. Then in November 2011, when he was 13, he was back to hospital to undergo surgery on an enlarged thyroid gland - and doctors learned he had Hurthle Cell Carcinoma, a rare thyroid cancer. On the gofundme page, his family explained that the cancer is believed to be an effect of treatment from his first battle with cancer. But now, nearly three years on from his second diagnosis, and his family say he is free from cancer again. One final scan in October will confirm that he is again cancer-free. In the meantime, Alex is impressing his family with his commitment as a student and a friend. Relatives told KERO that he once put together a yearbook for a friend, including photos and signatures from staff and students, after the teen could not afford to buy one from the school. Hopeful: His mother Liz, pictured right, launched a gofundme help and is appealing to foundations for funds . Alex is also taking advanced placement classes and has been singing with the choir for two years. He is already thinking about college, where he wants to major in psychology and sociology. 'He's just so positive,' his grandmother said. 'He sings, he's really active in school - but kids do stare at him. I can't wait for him to get his teeth but right now all we can do is take it one day at a time.' For more information or to donate to Alex Hunter's Medical Fund, visit the family's gofundme page.

"By . Associated Press . and Lydia Warren . A group of whale watchers expecting just a three-hour tour were forced to spend a long night at sea after their boat became snagged by a lobster trap rope off Massachusetts. The 157 passengers and six crew members became trapped 15 miles of the coast of Salem, near Boston, on Monday evening after one of the vessel's propellers got caught. Divers eventually cut the Boston Harbor Cruises boat free early on Tuesday and it was undergoing a final inspection before heading back to shore for 7.30am, the Coast Guard said. The boat had been expected to return by 4.30pm on Monday. Scroll down for video . Night at sea: 157 passengers and six crew members became stuck overnight after this Boston Harbor Cruises boat became snagged on a lobster trap 15 miles off the coast of Salem, Massachusetts . Ken Maguire, one of the passengers on . the boat, said about 10 minutes into the return trip on Monday, the boat stopped after apparently . hitting something. The Coast Guard determined that the propeller had become caught on a lobster trap, but initial attempts to cut it free were unsuccessful. They also attempted to transfer the passengers and crew to a separate ship, but that also failed, according to Coast Guard Petty Officer MyeongHi Clegg. Overnight, Coast Guard boats stayed near the vessel for security and passengers were provided with food, water, and blankets as temperatures dropped. On Tuesday morning, divers hired by the vessel's owner eventually succeeded in freeing the boat, Coast Guard Petty Officer MyeongHi Clegg told The Associated Press. 'They were able to untangle the line from the propeller,' said Clegg. Clegg said the Coast Guard was monitoring the safety of the passengers overnight and no serious medical problems were reported. The vessel will now be escorted back to shore by two Coast Guard cutters, but will be operating under only one propeller since the other was damaged in the incident, Clegg said. She expected the passengers would be very relieved that their ordeal was over. Whale watches are among the most popular tourist activities in the Boston area. Maguire said passengers were told they will get refunds and other assistance. The boat company hasn't returned a phone message seeking comment.","The boat became stranded about 15 miles from Boston on Monday afternoon after one of the boat's propellers became entangled on a rope .

"By . Lydia Warren . and Associated Press . Tragic: Jim Garcia, 71, passed away on June 30 when he collapsed just yards from a VA hospital . The heartbroken wife of a Vietnam veteran who died in a VA hospital cafeteria as he waited for an ambulance to arrive is still demanding answers about what happened. Carol Garcia had received a phone call on June 30 saying her husband, 71-year-old Jim Napoleon Garcia, had collapsed in the cafeteria beside the VA hospital in Albuquerque, New Mexico. But rather than rush him the 500 yards to the emergency room, staff followed VA policy and called for an ambulance. The policy instructs staff to call 911 for an emergency outside the main hospital. Mr Garcia, a grandfather, received CPR as he lay on the floor but he passed away. 'If my . husband had been treated quicker, could he have survived his heart . attack?' his wife of 32 years, Carol, asked in an interview with KOAT as her sons comforted her. Emergency response records show that an ambulance arrived to help Garcia about 10 minutes after the 911 call. Mrs Garcia said she believes that authorities have not been straight with her about her husband's death. 'We're trying to get answers and they . keep shutting down,' she said. 'They keep saying they want to be . transparent but they're not.' Heartbroken: Carol Garcia, pictured with one of her sons, is demanding to know if more could have been done . U.S. Veteran: Mrs Garcia said her husband of 32 years was in Vietnam between 1964 and 1966 . Last week, acting VA Secretary Sloan Gibson met with Mrs Garcia and her sons and told them he was going to launch a full investigation. He promised them a copy of their results, she said. But the next day, VA officials from Washington, D.C. announced contradicting news in a press conference, saying that all efforts had been made to save Mr Garcia's life. At the press conference, Gibson said an initial review found staffers followed procedure in providing help to the Vietnam War veteran. 'I thanked every single one of them individually,' he said. 'As I heard what they did, and I stood and looked at them in the eye, I was very proud.' He added that it would have been difficult to keep Garcia on an automated external defibrillator or perform CPR if he was placed on a gurney and rush to the emergency room on foot. Mrs Garcia said the statement made no sense. Proud: Acting Veterans Affairs Secretary Sloan Gibson told reporters last week that staffers responded properly when Mr Garcia collapsed and that he had thanked every one individually for their help . Scene: Staff performed CPR on Mr Garcia but he died before reaching the VA hospital, pictured . 'He says VA is not at fault in the vet's death and I don't know how they could say that when the autopsy hasn't been concluded yet,' she said. She is now demanding answers as well as a policy change to prevent a similar tragedy happening to another family. Attorneys representing the Garcia family will file a federal tort claim this week, giving the VA notice that they plan to sue over the death. Mr Garcia had served in Vietnam from 1964 to 1966. The family said he was an active member of the Innocents Car Club of North Hollywood, The Bottle and Insulator Club of New Mexico, and a collector of coins, insulators and Depression-era glasses. The family's anger comes as the VA deals with a national outcry over reports of long delays for treatment and medical appointments and of veterans dying while on waiting lists.","Jim Garcia suffered a heart attack in the VA cafeteria on June 30 .

Troubled: Rachel Canning, pictured in court in March, has been granted a temporary restraining order against her boyfriend - the same man her parents had been trying to get her to stop seeing . In court . Wednesday, Kitzmiller asked to have the hearing postponed because his . attorney, Steven Caputo, is out of town, NJ.com reports. Canning told the court she was 'ready to proceed' as she appeared without an attorney, but accompanied by her parents. Morristown . Superior Court Judge James DeMarzo agreed to postpone the hearing until . August 6, when Caputo is expected to return to New Jersey. In . addition to postponing the hearing, DeMarzo advised both parties to . 'not publicize the case,' and to 'keep your business to yourself.' The judge specifically told the couple it would be ill-advised to discuss the case on social media outlets. 'This . is a private matter,' Sean Canning, Rachel Canning's father, told the . publication. 'We’re confident the court will handle it appropriately.

Party: Canning, pictured right with friends ahead of prom, graduated high school and starts college in the fall . She claimed her parents threw . her out when she turned 18. But they claimed she voluntarily left their . Lincoln Park home because she didn't want to abide by their . household rules. She moved in with attorney John Inglesino, and in February . his family filed the suit on her behalf. Though Canning went to court hoping to shame her parents into paying her child support, she was the one who took the brunt of criticism - both from her parent's lawyers and the judge himself.

"By . Lydia Warren . Arrest: Ashley Reed, 16, allegedly buried her baby's body after a botched home birth . A 16-year-old girl has been arrested for burying her newborn daughter's body in her family's backyard after keeping the pregnancy a secret from her parents. Ashley Marie Reed, from Louisburg, North Carolina, handed herself in to sheriff's deputies in Franklin County on Tuesday and was charged with concealing and failure to report a death. The charges are the lowest class of felony, which means the teen, who has no prior criminal record, could serve between three and eight months of community service if she is convicted, the Associated Press reported. Reed's 18-year-old boyfriend, Aaron Davis, had urged her to tell someone about the pregnancy but she was too scared and hid her bump beneath large shirts, he claimed. She was full term when she gave birth to the 8.5lb baby in June. When she tried to cut her umbilical cord, she cut it too close to the baby's body, likely causing her to bleed to death, authorities said. She wrapped the baby, whom she had named Emma, in a grocery bag and buried the body in her family's backyard, police said. Sheriff Jones told the Charlotte Observer that killing the baby could have been an accident. 'But she had ample time to do some type of planning to prevent this – plan a way to give the child up to keep this from happening,' he said. Secret: Her boyfriend Aaron Davis, the baby's father, said she had hid her bump beneath large shirts . Fears: Davis' mother, pictured right, said that her son had also not told her about the pregnancy until afterwards . It was previously reported that the sheriff's department first suspected the child's death when someone who had overheard a conversation about the dead baby went to authorities, he said. The person 'overheard something like, so-and-so is having a baby, and she's not going to tell anyone about it,' Jones said. Investigators found the family involved and went to their house. The girl was not home and her relatives were shocked by the possibility that someone there had given birth, Jones said. As investigators looked around the house, one saw what appeared to be a bloody towel or shirt in the teenager's bedroom, he said. 'We had some suspicions, but we didn't have anything else,' Jones said. Investigators left but the girl's father called back several hours after they'd left and said: 'You need to come back to our house. We found what you're looking for.' Together: He said that Reed had texted him after the birth saying that their daughter had not survived . Her father led investigators to a shallow grave in the backyard where he had uncovered enough to see the baby's head, Jones said. At first, Jones was skeptical that the parents wouldn't know their daughter was pregnant, he said. 'I didn't really agree with that when I first heard it,' he said. 'But the social services people said teens are very, very clever in hiding this type of stuff. There may be ways of concealment that I don't know about.' Reed's boyfriend, 18-year-old Aaron Davis, told WRAL that she had kept her pregnancy hidden under large shirts and jackets. He said he had urged her to tell someone about the baby, but she was too scared to tell her parents. 'The last couple months, I kept trying to tell her to tell somebody,' he said. 'I was telling her to let somebody know.' Discovery: The baby's body was discovered after a friend overheard about the secret pregnancy and tipped off police. After deputies visited the family's home, Reed's father discovered the baby's body in the backyard . But Davis didn't tell anyone about the imminent birth either, and his mother told WRAL that she only learned about her granddaughter after the baby had been born. He said Reed had texted him the morning that her water broke and they had planned to meet at a church but she didn't make it. She texted him with the bad news. 'That was when she told me that the baby didn't make it,' he said. Sheriff Jones said the investigation was still underway, but would not say if there would be any more arrests in the case. Reed, who is out of jail after posting $50,000 bond, is scheduled to make her first court appearance on July 29.","Ashley Reed turned herself into authorities on Tuesday and was charged with concealing and failure to report a death .

"By . Lydia Warren . A forlorn Shia LaBeouf headed to court in New York today to face multiple charges for his bizarre outburst during a Broadway performance last month. The actor, who wore a sharp suit as he appeared at Manhattan Criminal Court, is trying to work out an agreement with prosecutors to resolve the case, his attorney told the judge on Thursday. LaBeouf, 28, has been charged with harassment, disorderly conduct and criminal trespassing for allegedly yelling abuse and slapping actors' behinds during a performance of 'Cabaret' on June 26. On Thursday, the actor and his lawyer, G. Robert Gage, declined to comment as they left court amid a swarm of cameras and microphones.

His lawyer said he and prosecutors are trying to figure out an agreement in LaBeouf's disorderly conduct case. They will return to court next month . He will be back in court in September 10. On June 26, the former child actor had reportedly spent the afternoon drinking margaritas at Iguana Bar in Midtown and watching Belgium play South Korea in the World Cup. Later that afternoon, he was seen wild-eyed and disheveled as he chased a homeless man through traffic in broad daylight around the city's Theater District, photographs show.

Bizarre behavior: Theater-goers said he was yelling during the performance and hitting actors' behinds .

On Twitter, Tony nominated composer Benj Pasek wrote: 'Just saw Shia LaBeouf in handcuffs in tears surrounded by 6 police offers outside of Cabaret the musical.' LaBeouf screamed at the arresting officer: 'F*** you... this is f****** b******t... Do you know my life? Do you know who the f*** I am?', according to The Smoking Gun. Officers told the New York Post that LaBeouf was 'incoherent and agitated' during the arrest. One said that the actor smelled bad and told lies about having served in the military.

Hours later, he was taken out of a Broadway theater in tears and arrested for disorderly conduct for disturbing a performance . Since the melee, he has been taking part in an outpatient alcohol treatment program. Another celebrated actor also had a Manhattan court date Thursday. Alec Baldwin was to appear in a separate disorderly conduct case. Baldwin was arrested in May. Police say he got belligerent after being stopped riding a bicycle the wrong way down a one-way street. Bizarre behavior: LaBeouf arrived at the Nymphomaniac premiere in February wearing a brown paper bag . Sadly, Shia LaBeouf's arrest for . disorderly conduct at a Broadway theater on Thursday is just the latest . incident in a string of erratic episodes for the former child star. At the end of last year, the Transformers star admitted that he had plagiarized 52-year-old cartoonist Daniel Clowes' graphic novel in a short film, HowardCantour.com, starring Jim Gaffigan. Observant viewers attacked the film as an almost direct adaptation of Clowes' 2007 comic even though Shia had initially failed to give Daniel any credit. His actions were called 'shameless theft' by the comic's publisher Eric Reynolds and a steady string of apologies from Shia ensued. He then made headlines when he walked the red carpet at the Berlin Film . Festival with a brown paper bag over his head. Around the same time he declared he was 'retiring from public life because of attacks against his artistic integrity'. Early this year, LaBeouf also got into a scuffle with a fellow drinker at the . Hobgoblin pub in New Cross, South London, headbutting him apparently . over remarks made about the mother of his girlfriend Mia Goth. And last year, the actor famously quit the . production of Broadway's ORPHANS then shared several confrontational emails . between himself and fellow actors Alex Baldwin and Tom Sturridge, . explaining why he pulled out of the show. In 2007, he was arrested for refusing to leave a Walgreens in Chicago but the criminal charges were later dropped. In . February 2005, LaBeouf was arrested in Los Angeles and charged with . assault with a deadly weapon for driving into his neighbor's car after . losing his temper about having to wait to get into his garage. He then . later turned up at his neighbor's door, allegedly waving a kitchen . knife.","Actor, 28, was dressed in a sharp suit for his appearance at Manhattan Criminal Court on disorderly conduct charges on Thursday .

"By . Lydia Warren . Staff at a Veterans Administration clinic locked a retired Marine inside after forgetting he was there. Jeffrey Duck, 53, said he was baffled when no one came to help him in a consultation room at the VA community clinic in Orange City near Orlando, Florida after more than three hours. When he went to inquire yet again about whether someone was coming to help him, he found an empty waiting room and office - and took out his cell phone to record the sparse scene. 'I'm kind . of disappointed,' he told WKMG of the incident. 'Really disappointed.' Scroll down for video . Disappointed: Retired Marine Jeffrey Duck was locked inside a VA clinic on Monday after staff forgot about him . Duck, from Deltona, explained how he had gone to the clinic around 1pm on Monday to refill a prescription for pain medication and was expecting to wait a while because he was a walk-in. He was told to wait and after a couple of hours, he returned to the desk and asked how much longer it was going to be. The longer he waited, the worst pain he was in, he told WOFL. But even as it neared closing time at 4pm, staff told him to keep waiting to see a doctor. Around 5pm he realized that there was no one left. 'I was apparently left there and forgotten,' he said. He started to worry that he would be seen and be accused of breaking in, so he took out his cellphone to record the empty hallway and rooms as a burglar alarm started. Where is everyone? Duck pulled out his cell phone and recorded the empty rooms after he was locked in . He also called 911 to explain the bizarre scenario. 'I apparently got left in a VA facility - a medical facility - and the alarm has been going off,' he told the 911 operator. 'So you're inside and there's no employees?' the operator asked. 'None that I can see,' he replied. He was eventually freed and his prescription was filled the next morning. The Veterans Administration also issued an apology to Duck on Tuesday. Scene: After he was left inside the clinic at Orange City, pictured, the VA apologized to Mr Duck . 'We want to apologize to Mr. Duck for his experience yesterday at the Orange City VA Community Based Outpatient Clinic,' they said in a statement. 'We are looking at our closing procedures and will make changes to ensure that this does not happen again.' He said he wasn't angry, just disappointed. But he added that he hoped that sharing his story would force the VA to look at how they are dealing with veterans. 'There's a lot of people with bigger problems than me,' he said.

"By . Mail Foreign Service . Updated: . 12:47 EST, 26 February 2012 . A glamorous politician who French First Lady Carla Bruni accused of trying to ‘steal her husband’ has been invited by President Nicolas Sarkozy to join his election campaign team. The French leader hopes the presence of attractive former justice minister Rachida Dati - who he used to call ‘my little Arab girl’ - will boost his appeal among France’s large immigrant population. Sarkozy, 56, and Dati, 46, travelled to a campaign rally in Lille this week, where she addressed a crowd dressed in skintight jeans and red stiletto boots. Glamour: Rachida Dati, 46, has been brought in to Nicolas Sarkozy's campaign team. The appointment his likely to anger the president's wife Carla Bruni, right . But the highly provocative gesture is likely to enrage 44-year-old former supermodel Bruni, who once told Dati she was trying to squirm her way into the president’s bed. Dati - born to Moroccan immigrant parents - was Sarkozy’s deputy campaign spokeswoman in 2007, as then appointed justice minister as part of the president’s ‘ethnically diverse’ cabinet. But Bruni was widely reported by the French media at the time to believe that Dati had ‘slept her way to the top’. The First Lady once took her former love rival on a tour of the Elysee Palace, pausing by the presidential bed to hiss: 'You’d have liked to have occupied that bed, wouldn’t you?' Then in 2009, rumours erupted in French newspapers that Preisdent Sarkozy and Bruni were both having affairs, and Dati was swiftly sacked on suspicion of starting them. For the past three years she has been a reluctant Euro-MP in Brussels and the mayor of a Paris district. Uphill battle: Nicolas Sarkozy, pictured yesterday, faces a tough fight to be re-elected as French president and has brought in Rachida Dati to bolster his campaign team . Her latest invitation to Sarkozy’s campaign top table is also certain to infuriate French prime minister Francois Fillon, as he and Dati are both fighting for the same Paris constituency in June’s parliamentary elections. French daily Liberation wrote after Dati appeared at Sarkozy’s side at this week’s campaign rally: 'Miracle in Lille! kozy resuscitates Rachida Dati.' Asked why Sarkozy had invited Dati back, Bruno Jeudi, editor of the respected Journal du Dimanche newspaper, said: 'He may be looking to regain some of the magic of 2007 and Dati was part of that. 'One explanation may be that the president thinks she will help him recast himself as a man of the people. Campaign trail: Nicolas Sarkozy flanked by French Justice Minister Rachida Dati who he used to call 'my little Arab girl' 'The other explanation could be that Sarkozy doesn’t want Dati as an enemy. 'Some say she has damaging information about him dating back to when both worked in the Hauts-de-Seine department.' Sarkozy’s election policy supremo Emmanuelle Mignon backed Dati’s return to the political front line, adding: 'She has incredibly punch, daring and bravery. She’s a real personality.' And in an off-the-record chat with French journalists recently, Sarko said he regretted not protecting Dati more three years ago. He said: 'I believed in her. She has talent.'","Carla Bruni accused Rachida Dati of trying to get into president's bed .

"By . Lydia Warren . Police have identified a woman wanted in a $175,000 bank fraud scam by matching up her account name with sexy selfies she posted to Facebook. Tanya Monique Peel, from Raleigh, North Carolina, allegedly set up a business account at a JP Morgan Chase Bank in Atlanta last December before transferring $123,000 from a stranger's Charles Schwab account. Peel, 26, used her real name on the account and when police found the name on Facebook, her selfies matched the woman recorded by bank surveillance cameras, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Wanted: This photo of Tanya Monique Peel on her Facebook page matched a woman seen withdrawing stolen funds from a bank on surveillance footage. A warrant is out for her arrest . Authorities are still looking for the woman and secured a warrant for her arrest last week. 'I think she is with a group of professionals,' Atlanta Police Detective Ken Stapler told the AJC. 'There is no way she did this by herself.' The transfer was carried out after Peel and fellow suspects stole the identity of the Charles Schwab client, 45-year-old Atlanta resident Terance Fowler. The investigation began when Fowler reported the theft to police. His bank refunded the stolen sum. He lost his money when the group got hold of his identifying information and his cellphone number, knowing that Charles Schwab called account holders after transfers were made from their accounts. Scam: She allegedly transferred $123,000 from one victim's account and her co-conspirators pretended to be the victim when authorities called them to verify the transfer. In total, they stole $175,000 from accounts . The team then forwarded all of the victim's calls to an untraceable cellphone so that when they transferred the cash, Charles Schwab representatives called his cell but ended up speaking to one of the fraudsters. They pretended to be him and gave authorization for the transfers. In total, they transferred $123,000 from his account to Peel's phony business account and another $52,000 to a Walls Fargo branch in California. Investigators say that Peel then immediately withdrew all the money from the account. Crimestoppers of Atlanta is now offering a $2,000 reward for information that leads to arrest and indictment of Peel. Callers can leave confidential tips at 404-577-TIPS (8477).","Tanya Monique Peel, from North Carolina, 'set up a business account at an Atlanta bank to transfer massive sums from a stranger's account'

"By . Lydia Warren . Two Utah brothers have died after their small plane crashed in the Arizona mountains just hours after they sent a final Snapchat showing them posing in front of the aircraft. Pilot Daulton Whatcott, 19, and his 16-year-old brother Jaxon took off in the single-engine Cessna 172 from Davis County on Sunday evening to head to Las Vegas for a basketball tournament. Around 7.30pm, as their parents waited for them to land, the teens' plane went down in a rocky area in Littlefield, Arizona. Crews had to hike to the burning wreckage to recover their bodies. Hours earlier, Jaxon had sent their father a Snapchat photo of them posing in front of the plane in Utah with the caption: 'My ride to Vegas.' Their dad, Rhett, shared the image to his Facebook page. Before tragedy: Daulton Whatcott, 19, (back) and his brother Jaxon, 16, sent this Snapchat before heading from Utah to Arizona on Sunday. Their plane crashed into mountains around 7.30pm, killing them both . He described his sons as 'inseparable' and said he comforted himself with the thought that the teenagers were still together, the Deseret News reported. It is not yet known what caused the plane crash but friend Jaden Carlson told the newspaper that Daulton was an experienced pilot. The Utah State University student had received his pilot's license earlier this year and was hoping to become a commercial pilot. 'He took a lot of people out on flights,' Carlson said. 'Instead of Sunday drives, he would go flying on Sunday. He'd skip . classes and go flying. He loved it. 'There's no way he could . have just been distracted. He knew what he was doing and he was . cautious, and he knew he had to be cautious to keep the people he loved . safe.' An investigation is underway to determine the cause but the report could take months to complete. Crash: The wreckage of their single-engine Cessna can be seen smoldering after crashing in rugged terrain just south of Interstate 15 near the Arizona-Utah border in Mohave County on Sunday . Hobby: Daulton, pictured flying with his father Rhett, became a licensed pilot earlier this year . The plane was heading to Mesquite, where the brothers were going to meet their parents, who were driving. But on the way, the brothers were forced to land in Beaver because of the bad weather. They called their parents to let them know and eventually took off again - but when they failed to arrive in Mesquite, their parents began to worry. The plane wreckage eventually came to rest on a ledge and recovery crews had to hike to the area. They put out a small fire and recovered the bodies of the victims. An FAA . spokesperson said the plane crashed and . burned under 'unknown circumstances'. A vigil was held for the students, who had both attended Syracuse High School, on Monday. Close: Family members said Daulton, left, and Jaxon, right, were 'inseparable' and both loved sports . Missed: Daulton, pictured, and Jaxon leave behind two siblings and their parents, Rhett and Eileen, pictured . 'Daulton and Jaxon were like one person and the same,' their basketball coach Trent Whiting said at the vigil, noting the diversity of students that had come to pay their respects. 'They were the most positive, energetic players. It didn't matter the practice, it didn't matter the game. They were always positive and always kept everyone's spirits up.' Daulton graduated high school in 2013 and was attending Utah State University. His younger brother was about to start his junior year at high school. The brothers are survived by their parents, Rhett and Eileen Whatcott, older brother Dace Whatcott and younger sister Aubri Whatcott.","Daulton Whatcott, 19, was the pilot of a single-engine Cessna that crashed on Sunday, killing him and his brother, 16-year-old Jaxon .

"By . Lydia Warren . Found: Jeremy Witfoth's body was mistaken for a hoax when it was found hanging in a vacant home . Two cleaners who found a body hanging in a garage at a vacant home mistakenly dumped it at a landfill - thinking it was a mannequin left behind as a sick prank. The men, Israel Lopez, 50, and Adam Hines, 36, had been hired to clean out the Spring Hill, Florida home after the owner was forced to evict the tenants a month ago. When the men arrived at the home on Thursday, it was in a state of disarray and filled with dead rodents 'like an episode of Hoarders', Hernando County Sheriff Al Nienhuis said at a news conference. The body, later identified as belonging to 33-year-old Jeremy Witfoth, appeared to be in a state of mummification and they assumed it was a hoax, police said. The owners of the property had also seen the body the day before and they too believed it was a cruel prank played by the former tenants who were angry about being kicked out, the Tampa Tribune reported. 'Both individuals as well as the property . owners believed the lifelike mannequin was a distasteful Halloween-like . hoax left by the former renters,' sheriff's officials said in a news . release. After the two men cut it down, Lopez hauled it to the local dump, while Hines continued to clean. Scroll down for video . Scene: He had been renting the home in Spring Hill, Florida, until he was evicted a month ago. The owners had also seen the body but assumed the tenants had pulled a prank for being kicked out . Disarray: The inside of the home was a mess and the cleaners thought the smell was due to dead rodents . At the landfill, workers saw the body and thought it looked real. Shortly before noon on Thursday, they contacted authorities, who confirmed their suspicions. Lopez later returned to the landfill with a second load of trash and workers recognized him and alerted authorities. He was questioned along with Hines and the property owner. Hernando County Sheriff's officials said Witfoth had apparently committed suicide several weeks ago and his body was in a 'state of decomposition similar to mummification'. On one of the walls, he had left a suicide note, authorities said. He had lived at the home with his girlfriend and several children before they broke up and were evicted. Authorities believe he had been dead for several weeks. Suspicions: Workers at a nearby landfill, pictured, called authorities when they saw the body and thought it might be real. When one of the cleaners returned a few hours later, he was questioned by cops . 'Honest mistake': Sheriff Al Nienhuis said at a press conference on Thursday night that the body had been in a state of mummification. The cleaners who found it have not been charged . Nienhuis said the two cleaners do not face any charges because it was an honest mistake. He said the men thought the home smelled but attributed it to the dead rodents found inside. 'I think it's important to realize that… most people, they either have seen someone who has very recently passed… or they see them at a funeral home,' Nienhuis said. 'Obviously, this body was not anything close to either of those. It was somewhat mummified.' The bizarre scenario is not unheard of. In St. Petersburg earlier this year, a security guard threw out the body of an elderly woman who had jumped to her death, believing it was a mannequin. He was not charged but he was fired.

"By . Lydia Warren . A Connecticut state trooper has pleaded guilty to stealing jewelery and $3,700 from the body of a motorcyclist who died at the scene of a crash after it was caught on his dashboard camera. Aaron Huntsman, 45, entered an Alford plea for third-degree larceny and tampering with evidence - meaning he does not admit to the charges but accepts he would likely be found guilty at a trial. The trooper, who had been with the department for 18 years at the time of the crime in 2012, will spend more than a year in prison, the Connecticut Post reported. He . allegedly stole a gold chain, valued at $5,500, and a roll of cash from . 49-year-old John Scalesse's body when he was killed after he crashed . into a truck on Route 15 in Fairfield on September 22, 2012. Plea: Former state trooper Aaron Huntsman, pictured left with his attorney in court in 2012, pleaded guilty to stealing a deceased motorcyclist's gold chain and more than $3,000 in cash . Huntsman was the first trooper to the scene and his dashboard camera filmed him walking over to the body, picking up the chain from a pool of blood and taking out the cash from Scalesse's pocket. He later told the victim's family that he had not seen any money on him. An investigation was launched after the deceased man's relatives expressed concerns about missing items and the police log failed to show the jewelry. When questioned about the items by his supervisor, Huntsman said he had left the chain in the cup holder in his police car inside a glove and had forgotten about it - but denied having the cash. The money . was later found under the seat in Huntsman's cruiser, police said. Despite the evidence and the footage, Huntsman maintained he was . innocent. He was arrested in November 2012 and left the state troopers in May 2013. Missed: John Scalesse, pictured left and right, was killed when he crashed his motorcycle into a truck in September 2012. Huntsman's dashboard camera filmed him stealing the man's belongings . Investigation: Huntsman, pictured in his trooper uniform, has always denied stealing the items but they were both found in his car when authorities launched an investigation. He left the troopers in 2013 . The victim's family said they were relieved that the case was over. 'John didn't deserve his memory to be . tarnished like this and we are finally glad it’s almost over,' Scalesse’s mother, Marguerite, told the Post. 'After all we have gone through . we are glad that he (Huntsman) at least didn’t make us go through a . trial.' Huntsman will be sentenced on October 3, where he is expected to get 16 months in prison followed by five years of probation. He could have faced up to 10 years in prison but Superior Court Judge Robert Devlin said he would impose the shorter term but Huntsman's lawyer can still argue for a lesser term.","Aaron Huntsman, 45, entered an Alford plea - meaning he does not admit to the charges but accepts he would be found guilty at a trial .

"By . Lydia Warren . Arrest: Acquitted killer Robert Durst, pictured in a new mugshot, allegedly urinated in a Texas CVS . A millionaire real estate heir who escaped the public eye for years by crossdressing before he was accused of killing his neighbor has been arrested again for urinating in a CVS, police said. Robert Durst, who was acquitted of murder in 2003 after claiming self defense, has been arrested for allegedly urinating over $100 worth of candy at the register in a Houston drugstore on Sunday. He took the bizarre step after getting in an altercation with staff, sources told KTRK, and he was charged with a Class B misdemeanor. Durst, now 71, has been making headlines for years - first over his wife's mysterious disappearance and then over the murder of his elderly neighbor in 2001. His father, Seymour, was a New York real estate mogul who amassed billions . of dollars worth of commercial property in Manhattan. Robert, a . well-connected socialite, worked for his father's Durst . Organization for years as a developer. But he was estranged from his . family around 1994 after being passed over as heir to the company . leadership in favour of his brother Douglas. The . Houston Chronicle reported that in 2006 he finally won a $65 million . court settlement from his family, restoring a piece of his family . fortune. Scene: Durst allegedly urinated over $100 worth of candy at the register after getting into an argument with store staff at this CVS in Houston on Sunday, according to local reports . Ten years earlier, Durst had gained infamy in New York . due to the mysterious disappearance of his wife, Kathie, and many believed the real estate scion had something to do with it. He was questioned in her murder - and in the murder of her friend when the case was re-opened in 2000 - but was never charged. He has now re-married, KTRK reported, but the identity of his new wife was not released. Then in September 2001, remnants of the body of Morris . Black, Durst's next-door neighbor in the boarding house where he was . living, were found floating in the Galveston Bay in . Galveston, Texas. Questions: Durst, with his wife Kathleen Durst, was suspected to be responsible for her 1982 disappearance . A trail of blood led police back to an apartment being rented by a mute woman, . Dorothy Ciner - who was actually Durst in a dress. It emerged that Durst had gone into hiding for years, partially to escape the increasing inquiries about the death of his wife. After . spending a month on the run, Durst tried to steal a chicken . salad sandwich and a single a Band-Aid from a supermarket in . Philadelphia while wearing a blond mustache and was arrested. Durst . admitted to shooting Black and dismembering him before dumping the body parts in the Bay. But he insisted that he had acted in self defense as they struggled over a handgun and he was acquitted. Killer: Durst is pictured left in a police booking photo in 2001 after he was arrested for the murder of neighbor Morris Black, right. At the time of the killing, he had been crossdressing to conceal his real identity . Acquitted: He admitted to shooting and dismembering Black but claimed he had acted in self-defense after they argued over a gun. He was acquitted and served a year for tampering with evidence . But he was found guilty for tampering with evidence over the disposal of the body and was sentenced to five years in prison, but served just one. Despite his run-ins with the law, he still has access to his $43 million trust fund, which he has used to buy and develop real estate in New York. Just last week it was reported that Durst sold two Brooklyn buildings for $21.15 million, after buying them for $8.65 million in 2011.","Robert Durst, 71, 'got into an altercation with staff at a store in Houston and urinated over $100 worth of candy at the register'

The 53-year-old, identified Thursday afternoon as financial executive Eric McLean Slighton, had already passed through security at the airport on Tuesday morning before drinking for a few hours in the airport lounge, according to the police report. Slighton has been managing director of Barclays Capital and Deutsche Bank in Hong Kong, and according to his father he was due to fly to Hong Kong from San Francisco this week. He was carrying business cards at the time of his arrest listing him as a 'director' at Aktis Capital Singapore, a high powered private equity company that lists him as one of four partners. After passing through, he returned to the A-side . security checkpoint of the airport's International Terminal and . allegedly took a pair of plastic blue gloves so he would look the part. He was wearing khakis, a blue polo shirt and blue rubber gloves - which is similar to the uniform worn by screeners for security company Covenant, who man the checkpoint and he may have stolen the gloves. The financial powerhouse convinced an Asian woman, a foreigner who had already passed the screening, that he was a TSA agent and led her to a private screening area for a pat down, police said. Faker: The suspect posed as a TSA agent and patted down two female passengers after drinking for hours in an airport lounge, police said. He is believed to have stolen blue gloves so he would look the part (stock image) Authorities do not know what happened between Slighton and woman because she left for her flight afterwards and could not be tracked down. The man then led another woman, who was also not a U.S. citizen, into the booth - but this time he was stopped by fellow agents who had become suspicious. They noted that he was heading to the screening area alone with the woman - whereas male officers are only allowed to screen a woman if a female agent is with them. Agents detained until police arrived and he was charged with public drunkenness. Reached on the phone by the San Francisco Chronicle in New York, his father professed shock at his son's alleged actions . He said that while his son used to have a drinking problem, he has been sober for 10 year. Authorities were unable to track down the two women who he allegedly groped, but if they come forward, Slighton could face more charges, such as false imprisonment, authorities said. TSA have now taken over the investigation and has not returned MailOnline's request for comment about how the man was able to pose as an officer. A law enforcement source suggested to the . Chronicle that '[s]omeone has to pay for this'.","Eric McLean Slighton 'spent hours drinking in the San Francisco airport lounge before posing as an agent at security on Tuesday'

"By . Lydia Warren . Jerry Sandusky's adopted son has opened up to Oprah Winfrey about his convicted pedophile father's bedtime 'ritual'. Matthew Sandusky, one of the six children adopted by the Penn State coach and his wife, previously revealed he was sexually abused by his father for seven years, starting when he was just eight. In an exclusive interview with Oprah, which will air in full on OWN at 9pm on Thursday night, he revealed that the Sandusky home was a very happy place to be - until that bedtime ritual. 'The overnight visits were... they were good,' Matthew said in a preview clip for the interview. 'I mean, except for that one part: bedtime. Bedtime was the bad part.' Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Matthew Sandusky will detail his abuse at the hands of his father in an interview this week . Brave: He will speak to Oprah Winfrey, right, in his first television interview since the trial in 2012 . He explained: 'Any other time that we were in the home with the family, it was fine. You'd look at that family and you would say, ""Wow. I wish that I had brothers and sisters that cared about me. I wish that I had a mother who cooked dinner every night for the whole family. I wish that I had all of these things. 'But then at bedtime, his ritual began.' The interview will be his first television since his father was convicted in 2012. Ahead of its airing, OWN explained that Matthew would be sharing 'a deeply personal account of the grooming, methodical control and manipulation he faced as a child'. It adds . that Matthew will respond 'to the accusations his adoptive mother, . Dottie Sandusky, made on national television accusing him of lying and . stealing from the family'. Sandusky, . who retired in June 30, 1999 as Penn State's defensive coordinator, was . convicted in 2012 of molesting 10 boys over 15 years, some in the . football team's showers on campus. Pedophile: Jerry Sandusky, pictured in January 2013, was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison for his crimes . The 70-year-old is now serving a 30- to 60-year state prison sentence. Matthew . had met Sandusky when he attended his charity summer camp for . underprivileged children and he often stayed the night with the family. He began living with the family full-time when he was 16. He . had been expected to be a defense witness for his father until the . trial, when he told investigators that he also had been abused. His story first . became public when a secret tape of a 29-minute interview he did with police . during the middle of his father's trial was leaked to NBC. In the . tape, Matt said his father would enter his bedroom at night and 'blow . raspberries' on his stomach, then move his hand down his body, rubbing . up against his genitals. He said he would sometimes cower 'in a fetal position' in his bed trying to avoid his father. In total, he said he suffered seven years of molestation, between the ages of eight and 15, at the hands of his adoptive father. He initially denied there had been any abuse before speaking out. In an interview for a documentary at the Sundance Film Festival in January, he said that he felt 'betrayed' by the entire Sandusky family after he took the decision to speak out against his father. Hurtful: Matthew Sandusky said he felt betrayed by his adopted mother Dottie, right in 2011, after they failed to support him when he came forward with allegations about his father's abuse . But . he said that he refused to be a 'coward' and risked everything to turn . against those who had adopted him from a deprived upbringing and brought . him up in an affluent household. Last year he reached a settlement with Penn State and petitioned to legally change his . name, and that of his wife and four children. The interview comes a few weeks after Pennsylvania's attorney general released a review of the prosecution but found no evidence of political interference by then Governor Tom Corbett. The report, however, did reveal three years of 'inexplicable delays' to prosecute the former Penn State football coach on child abuse charges. The pedophile's home was not searched and the report notes that it took a full year, from March 2009 until March 2010, for the office to recommend charging Sandusky when 'Victim 1' came forward. It took more 18 months before Sandusky was arrested because the prosecutor's supervisors believed the testimony of one victim would be 'insufficient against a community icon like Sandusky'.

"By . Leon Watson . Francois Hollande's affair with the actress Julie Gayet appears to be over after she was seen on holiday with another man and he went off on a break alone, it was claimed today. Reports of a split follow months of speculation over the personal life of France's bachelor president since he dumped his live-in-girlfriend in January. Valerie Trierweiler, 49, had to leave the Elysee Palace when Mr Hollande’s secret affair with Miss Gayet, a 42-year-old actress, was made public. Scroll down for video . Actress Julie Gayet has been seen on holiday with another man while Francois Hollande went off on a break alone . But now it appears Miss Gayet, who kept a low profile ever since, refusing to even acknowledge she is seeing the head of state, has moved on. In pictures published in Voici, a glossy magazine, she was photographed on a beach in Corsica with another man, believed to be finance management lawyer Pierre Puybasset. The magazine said the actress stayed five days before returning to Paris. Ms Gayet had enjoyed a 'holiday of love' on the Mediterranean island, according to Atlantico, a news website. Meanwhile, Mr Hollande is spending ten days in La Lanterne, an 18th-century residence made available to presidents and prime ministers in Versailles, outside Paris. Mr Hollande’s secret affair with Julie Gayet (pictured), a 42-year-old actress, was made public earlier this year . French media reports had claimed last month that Mr Hollande was preparing to marry his mistress next week on his 60th birthday . The man Miss Gayet is pictured with is believed to be finance management lawyer Pierre Puybasset . Earlier this year Mis Gayet launched civil proceedings against magazines for publishing pictures of Mr Hollande arriving at flat in Paris on the back of a moped . New love interest? Miss Gayet, the 42-year-old actress, embraces a man in Corsica . French media reports had claimed last month that Mr Hollande was preparing to marry his mistress next week on his 60th birthday. The rumours intensified on July 14, Bastille Day, when Mr Hollande was asked directly about his private life in a live interview. Mr Hollande said: 'When I have information, I’ll communicate it, I’ll do it, but I have none.' Mr Hollande, a Socialist, has never expressed any interest in the institution of marriage before, despite having four children with his Ecology Minister, Segolene Royal, another former girlfriend. Francois Hollande has been plagued by rumours about his personal life since splitting up with his live-in-girlfriend in January . Ms Trierweiler (left) suffered an emotional breakdown when she heard about the deception, checking herself into hospital for more than a week . But it is thought that Mr Hollande has felt increasingly uncomfortable attending official engagements without an official partner. Writing on the website of Le Nouvel Observateur, Thierry de Cabarrus, a political commentator, said that if Ms Gayet had found a new lover, she had done Mr Hollande a favour. 'It is possible to imagine that the president, who wants to finish the catastrophic pollution of his political action through reports on his supposed private life, is satisfied by this epilogue. 'He is now going to be able to move on to something else and forget those humiliating moments when political journalists ... asked him questions that had nothing to do with his political life. François Hollande is freed from one hell of a problem.' Mr de Cabarrus said the president had been plunged into a 'vaudeville' by the disclosure in Closer, a magazine, of his liaison with Ms Gayet in January.","Reports follow months of speculation over president's personal life .

"By . Leon Watson . Victoria Quibell-Smith, 30, wreaked revenge on her husband by trashing her marital home in Cwmbran, South Wales . A spurned wife wreaked revenge on her husband by trashing her marital home after she was ordered out by his family. Victoria Quibell-Smith, 30, caused £7,300 damage in a wrecking spree at her house after splitting up with husband Paul. She even roped in her children to scribble on the walls. Quibell-Smith started destroying the inside of the house in the quiet suburban street in Cwmbran, south Wales, after father-in-law Roger Smith gave her notice to leave. Quibell-Smith then damaged all the couple's prized personal possessions and decor at the property. Prosecutor Gareth James said: 'He found smashed glass littering the floor, cigarette ends and ash were scattered in a bedroom - and with rooms smelling of urine. 'She had let her children write on the house’s walls with red pen.' Quibell-Smith wrote on the wall herself but tried to make out that it had been done by an infant by drawing with her left hand. Removals man Dale Cronin, who was called to collect her belongings, said in a statement that he had never seen a house in 'such a disgusting state'. He said: 'It was dirty, minging and smelled.' Mother-of-two Quibell-Smith lived in the house owned by her father-in-law while she was married to his son. Newport Crown Court heard when the marriage ended Quibell-Smith left her former father-in-law with a £7,304.44 repair bill. Among the personal items she wrecked were five of her ex-husband’s sports cigarette cards, each worth £150. Other pictures worth £600 were also damaged. Quibell-Smith, now of Ystrad Mynach, near Caerphilly, pleaded guilty to damaging property. Quibell-Smith left her former father-in-law with a £7,304.44 repair bill after wrecking her home in Cwmbran, south Wales . Judge Tom Crowther told her: 'You embarked on a campaign of deliberate destruction in the house. You are richly deserving of a custodial sentence.' But he said her protests that she was the sole carer for her children was the only reason she would not be sent to prison. Quibell-Smith was given a four-month prison sentence, suspended for two years. But she must pay her ex-husband £1,250 compensation for destroying his possessions after the court heard the damage was covered by insurance.","Victoria Quibell-Smith, 30, was enraged when she split with husband .

"By . Leon Watson . The only film poster ever to show the Phantom of the Opera's unmasked face has sold for $200,000. The poster was printed in 1925 to promote the release of Universal Studios' film about a deformed composer who terrorises an opera house in Paris after falling in love with an opera singer. Swedish artist Gustaf Tenggren designed four posters ahead of the film's release but only one revealed the disfigured face of the Phantom. For sale: The 90-year-old film poster which is the only one ever to show the Phantom of the Opera's unmasked face . It shows the Phantom lurking in the waters of the catacombs waiting to pounce on the partner of his object of desire, opera singer Christine. It is the only poster ever made in which the Phantom's disfigured face is unmasked, and original examples are considered among the most rare film posters on the market. The poster which sold is one of only four in existence worldwide, one of which is held by Universal Studios themselves. It was once owned by Hollywood actor Nicolas Cage.

The 41ins by 27ins poster was sold at Heritage Auctions in Dallas, Texas, on behalf of a private collector. It was snapped up for $200,000 - $34,000  more than was estimated. Grey Smith, director of movie posters at Heritage, said: 'In the 1920s Universal were the kings of horror thanks to their success with The Hunchback of Notre Dame which starred Lon Chaney. 'In 1924 Carl Laemmle, Universal's president, was looking for a follow-up hit and turned to Gaston Leroux's novel The Phantom of the Opera. 'Chaney was cast again to play the disfigured composer who falls in love with, and then kidnaps, a rising opera star. 'Four designs of poster were made for the film but only one - the one we have for sale - gave a glimpse of the Phantom's face without his famous mask. 'It is regarded by collectors as by far the best Phantom of the Opera poster for that reason. 'Only three other examples of this poster exist worldwide so it is incredibly rare and hugely sought after. 'Its history is not clear but at some point in the 1990s it was bought by Nicolas Cage before being sold on again to another private collector. 'It is in incredible condition - the colours are as bright as the day they were printed. 'It is simply a glorious image that for collectors of film posters would be a key piece to their collection.'","Poster printed in 1925 to promote release of Universal Studios' film .

"By . Leon Watson . Russia's richest and most powerful female oligarch is suing an oil tycoon with a pop star wife after he allegedly conned her out of £80 million. Elena Baturina, who lives in Holland Park, west London, says oil and gas magnate Alexander Chistyakov ripped her off over an investment. Mr Chistyokov, 41, who is married to Russian chart-topper GluKosa, 28, denies any wrongdoing and has accused Ms Baturina of breaching the agreement between them. Elena Baturina (left), Russia's richest woman. The billionairess oligarch is locked in an £80m Appeal Court fight with oil tycoon Alexander Chistyakov. Mr Chistyokov (right), 41, is married to Russian chart-topper GluKosa, 28 . The dispute is over an investment she made through one of her companies towards a proposed multi-million-pound luxury property development in Morocco in 2008. Ms Baturina, who is married to former mayor of Moscow Yuri Luzhkov, is the only Russian woman to have amassed a nine-figure personal fortune. The 51-year-old moved to the UK three years ago because of 'political difficulties' says there are good reasons why she does not feel able to return to her homeland. Now she is asking Appeal Court judges, Lords Justice Rimer, Lewison and Christopher Clarke, to rule that her dispute with Mr Chistyakov ought to be decided in an English court. Ms Baturina, whose two daughters, Elena and Olga, attended University College London, made her fortune in cement and construction during the years following the break-up of the Soviet Union. She is well known as an art collector and is the patron of several creative charities. Glukosa - real name Natalia Ionova - is pop star wife of oil tycoon Alexander Chistyakov . She claims that Mr Chistyakov, 41, chairman of an oil and gas company, 'induced' her into signing away almost £80million, which has now disappeared. Ms Baturina is now trying to force Mr Chistyakov - who caused a sensation in Russia by marrying GluKosa, a pop starlet 13 years his junior - to repay the money and wants her claim against him heard in England. Summarizing her case during a hearing last year, Mr Justice Walker said she claims 'that Mr Chistyakov made fraudulent representations to her which led to her signature of the agreement and to her participation in the joint venture.' GluKosa is a pop starlet 13 years younger than Mr Chistyakov . Mr Chistyakov, 41, caused a sensation in Russia by marrying GluKosa . However, Mr Chistyakov 'alleges that Ms Baturina's representatives caused him substantial personal loss' and that she 'failed fully to invest in the projects, thereby breaching the principal agreement.' The judge dealt Ms Baturina a serious blow when he ruled she would have to pursue her claim against Mr Chistyakov in Russia. Challenging that decision, Barbara Dohmann QC, for Ms Baturina, told the Appeal Court: 'The fundamental issue will be, to put the issue at its most straighforward, what happened to the £80m? 'It is Ms Baturina's case that she trusted Mr Chistyakov and that considerable sums went out... she invested nearly 100 million euros in the projects through funds advanced by a company of which she was then the sole owner. Ms Baturina is married to former mayor of Moscow Yuri Luzhkov (pictured) 'Ms Baturina's claim is that, in breach of the principal agreement, the bulk of the funds which she had provided were not invested in the projects, but were wrongfully dissipated by Mr Chistyakov through a series of international companies.' Insisting the case should be heard by an English judge, the QC added: 'It is apparent that the shape of the case has very little to do with Russia.' She told the court that there had been an agreement between Ms Baturina and Mr Chistyakov that any disputes would be settled under English law, though it was not specified which country would host any hearing. She added: 'Ms Baturina lives in England. Mr Chistyakov has important business interests in England. 'He was served with the proceedings in England in March 2013. There is not a great deal of Russian evidence. We would suggest there is a heavy weight of witnesses on the non-Russian side.' However, Stephen Moverley Smith QC, for Mr Chistyakov, insisted that Russia was the right forum for the case to be fought out. At the time of the deal, the parties were all living in Russia. 'The parties are Russian nationals. Mr Chistyakov resided in and carried on business in Russia. Until 2011 Ms Baturina resided in and carried on business in Russia. Any damage was suffered in Russia,' he told the judges. Ms Baturina says that she and her daughters moved to London after she and her husband were criticised on Russian state television following his dismissal  in 2010. She had retained part ownership of a 10-room Moscow apartment but said she 'did not feel able to return to Russia at present'. In his ruling last year, Mr Justice Walker accepted that she had 'a real anxiety' at the prospect of going back to Russia. But he went on to decide that it was 'clearly and distinctly more appropriate' for her dispute with Mr Chistyakov to be dealt with by a Russian court. The Court of Appeal has now reserved its judgement on Ms Baturina's appeal until a later date.","Elena Baturina claims oil magnate Alexander Chistyakov ripped her off .

"By . Leon Watson . A baby who had a heart attack 48 hours after being born and faced never walking or talking has finally returned home to join his twin brother. Joshua Arndt-Skyrme had been out of hospital less than 24 hours when mother Jaime Arndt, 25, noticed he was grunting unusually and took him back to A&E where he went into cardiac arrest. While his twin Charlie was thriving at home in Leominster, Herefordshire, Joshua spent two months in hospital fighting a life-threatening infection and meningitis when doctors gave his parents the grim warning that he might never wake up. Back home: Jaime Arndt, 25, from Leominster, Herefordshire, and her baby Joshua who suffered a heart attack . Jaime Arndt rushed Joshua to hospital where he had a heart attack and his condition deteriorated even further and he began to have constant seizures . But Charlie visited him in his hospital cot for 'twin time' every day and now he's returned home and his parents count themselves lucky to finally be changing double the number of nappies. When non-identical twins Joshua and Charlie were born weighing 6lb 1oz and 5lb 3oz on March 28 Jaime's biggest worry was how she was going to manage a double buggy. It was only when first born twin Joshua started making grunting noises at just two days old that Jaime started having other concerns. She rushed him to hospital where he had a heart attack and his condition deteriorated even further and he began to have constant seizures. He was diagnosed with Group B Strep - a normally harmless bacteria found in 25 per cent of humans that, if passed onto babies during labour, can have terrible consequences. The newborn spent three and a half weeks in intensive care and parents Jaime and Lee were told he was unlikely to survive and were given the chance to take him off the ventilator keeping him alive. Baby Joshua Arndt-Skyrme with twin Charlie in hospital. Joshua spent two months in hospital fighting a life-threatening infection and meningitis . Three weeks after his heart attack Joshua had started breathing independently and within two months he was back at home like any other baby . Joshua had a heart attack at just 48 hours old and faced never walking or talking . Doctors gave his Joshua's parents the grim warning that he might never wake up . Doctors warned that even if he did wake up it was possible he would never be able to walk, talk or move. But just three weeks later Joshua had started breathing independently and within two months he was back at home like any other baby. His hearing is perfect and now his family are waiting on other tests to confirm that he hasn't been affected in any other way. Back together: Non-identical twins Joshua and Charlie were born weighing 6lb 1oz and 5lb 3oz on March 28 . Jaime said: 'When they were born I was worried about changing all the nappies and the sleepless nights but now I couldn't be happier to be doing it' Joshua (left) was diagnosed with Group B Strep - a normally harmless bacteria found in 25 per cent of humans that, if passed onto babies during labour, can have terrible consequences . Now Jaime and her family are fundraising for Birmingham Children's Hospital where Joshua was treated and campaigning for all pregnant women to be offered the test for Group B Strep. If a simple test in the final weeks of pregnancy proves positive for the bacteria, antibiotics during labour can minimise the chances of babies developing the infection. In the UK, the test is currently only recommended for mothers deemed at specific risk but 40 per cent of cases develop where there are no known risk factors. Jaime said: 'One of the best things is having us all together as a family and the boys back together' Jaime and her family are fundraising for Birmingham Children's Hospital where Joshua was treated . Alright now: Joshua is back home where he belongs with his family . Jaime said: 'I'm just overjoyed that the twins are back together. 'When they were born I was worried about changing all the nappies and the sleepless nights but now I couldn't be happier to be doing it. 'The simple things mean a lot now! 'When they asked if we wanted to turn the life support off we knew it was touch and go. 'But he just needed a bit more time and he was such a fighter he was soon munching on the tube trying to breath for himself. 'The doctors really didn't know what his chances were. It's more common for babies who have been through what Josh has not to make it. 'So the fact that he's here with us and his hearing hasn't been affected at all in incredible. He's doing more every day. 'One of the best things is having us all together as a family and the boys back together. 'You can tell they know they've been reunited. They're more settled when they're together. Although they had 'twin time' during Joshua's hospitalisation when Charlie went to sit in his cot for a bit each day it wasn't the same. 'Now they cuddle up and they've always got one body part touching the other. Them having that time together in hospital must have helped him through. 'I'd definitely tell pregnant women to get the test for Group B Strep done. 'If we'd have known about it before Josh was born it would have prevented everything. It's heart-breaking to know that other parents could be in the same situation as us but not be so lucky when it could have been prevented.'","Joshua Arndt-Skyrme spent two months in hospital fighting infection .

Mother-of-two Emma Watkins, 32, of Washington, Tyne and Wear, told MailOnline how her holiday became a 'disaster' and her daughter was so ill she had to be taken to hospital. 'It was our first family holiday ever, the first time we had gone away with the kids and it was so traumatic.

Another holidaymaker commented: '(We) asked to be moved to a different hotel on our fifth day. On arrival we had to ask for a new mattress in our room as ours stank of vomit, not a great start. 'By day two children were being sick all around us, in the dining room and around the pool. I can’t help but wonder why this is the second year running that this hotel is plagued by bugs when other hotels of a similar standard are not? 'The fact that our mattress was rancid and would not have been removed unless we asked suggests that although the hotel is being cleaned on the surface, this is not enough.' Holiday compensation firm Your Holiday Claims said dozens of tourists were now taking legal action against both Thomson and Thomas Cook. Anne Thomson, head of travel law at Your Holiday Claims, said: 'I have spoken to a large number of holidaymakers who have suffered illness at the Stil Victoria Playa and had their long awaited, hard earned holidays ruined. 'Many families have been forced to spend their holiday attending the local hospital and days confined to their hotel rooms. 'I am very concerned by the continuing reports of illness. It is vitally important that Thomson and the hotel management carry out a full investigation in to the cause of the sickness bugs at this hotel.' A spokesman for Thomson said: 'We are aware of a very small number of cases of sickness in Victoria Playa hotel, Menorca, with symptoms experienced similar to a virus. 'Our holiday advisors in Menorca have been supporting and advising any customers who have reported that they are unwell. No new cases have been reported within the last week. 'A thorough investigation has been conducted by an independent health and safety consultant, who has also confirmed that the correct containment procedures are in place. 'Thomson closely audits all the resorts to which we operate to ensure that health and hygiene levels are maintained and 93 per cent of customers who stayed at the hotel over the last four weeks have rated it as good or excellent.' A spokesman for Thomas Cook said: 'We take health and hygiene issues very seriously and maintaining the safety of our guests is our number one priority. In early June of this year, a very small number of our customers staying at the Club Mac Alcudia in Majorca reported a stomach upset, usually lasting approximately 24 to 48 hours. 'We are aware that a statement was recently issued by a no-win, no-fee lawyer, which contains as yet unsubstantiated allegations with regards to the nature of this illness. 'Preliminary indications from the independent hygiene consultant and our own investigations suggest that this was of a viral nature. 'We know how important holidays are to people and how upsetting it can be when even a small number of customers fall ill while overseas. The Club Mac Alcudia management put into place internationally recognised Prevention of Spread of Infection procedures, and an independent hygiene consultant supported their efforts while ensuring that the relevant guidelines were being followed. 'We ask any customers who may have concerns relating to their holiday to contact us directly and as quickly as possible so that we can deal with them personally in an open, honest and fair manner. 'We are confident that those customers due to travel to the resort in the future will experience the excellent levels of quality and standards they would expect from a Thomas Cook property. Accordingly, normal booking conditions apply.' It comes after a sickness bug left at least 100 British tourists ill, with several on drips after it swept through an Egyptian holiday resort. Holidaymakers at the Coral Sea Waterworld complex were affected by the bug, thought to be Shigella, which causes diarrhoea, stomach cramps and fever. People staying at the four-star resort in Sharm el Sheikh said some tourists were confined to their rooms during the majority of their stay at the hotel, with some on intravenous drips. Many of those affected blamed the outbreak on poor hygiene and dirty utensils and buffet containers.","At least 50 fell ill at Club Mac Alcudia, on the Balearic island of Mallorca .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Speaker John Bercow tried to humiliate David Cameron in the Commons today by cutting him off mid-sentence. During raucous exchanges at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Cameron was shouted down by Labour MPs and interrupted by Mr Bercow. As the PM tried to protest that he had not finished, the Speaker hit back: 'He can take it from me that he is finished.' Scroll down for video . Speaker John Bercow slapped down the Prime Minister, cutting of his joke and telling he had finished before moving on to other business . Mr Bercow has been embroiled in a long-running feud with senior Tories who object to his attitude when chairing debates . The extraordinary slapdown from the Speaker marks a new low in relations between the two men, who have often clashed in the Commons. Senior Tories also accuse Mr Bercow of using obscure parliamentary tactics to embarrass the party and foster rebellion. During Prime Minister's Questions, the Speaker called 'order!' several times as the heckling drowned out exchanges at the Despatch Box. Mr Cameron and Labour leader Ed Miliband clashed over the government's handling of the Royal Mail privatisation. David Cameron protested that he had not finished speaking, before being interrupted by Mr Bercow . But as the PM went on the attack, accusing Labour of failing to acknowledge economic growth and joking about Mr Miliband;s new election guru David Axelrod. Mr Bercow rose to his feet and called out: 'Order! Order!' Mr Cameron protested: 'But I haven't finished.' He won loud, sustained cheers from his Tory benches for the put-down. But in an attempt to restore order, Mr Bercow said: 'In response to that question, the Prime Minister has finished and he can take it from me that he is finished.' Mr Cameron totally ignored the Speaker and buried his head in a folder of paperwork. In recent weeks Tory ministers have . also begun to suspect Mr Bercow is using his powers as Speaker to cause . trouble for the government. They complain that amendments to legislation . are called against standard convention, or the timing of debates and . votes are co-ordinated to maximise embarrassment for Mr Cameron's administration. 'What he is doing with the procedures of the House is far more worrying that outbursts during PMQs,' a Tory minister said. Today's episode is just the latest in a long-running saga between Mr Bercow and senior Tories. Last . year relations reached such a low that MPs designed badges with three . bees pictured, to show they were members of the BBB club: ‘Bol****ed By . Bercow’. They included Iain Liddell-Grainger, the . mild-mannered Bridgwater and West Somerset MP, who was wrongly accused on heckling at a Labour MP. Mr Bercow yelled: ‘Be quiet, and if . you cannot be quiet, get out. You are adding nothing, and you are . subtracting a lot. It is rude, it is stupid, it is pompous and it needs . to stop.’ But to the Speaker’s embarrassment, . Tory Minister Alan Duncan admitted that he was the heckler, with Mr . Liddell-Grainger the innocent party. Anna Soubry, now a defence minister, was . attacked three times by the Speaker, who declared that she ‘thinks her . views are relevant, but we are not interested’. Mr Bercow also issued an . extraordinary rebuke of respected Defence Secretary Philip Hammond over . his handling of a Commons statement on the Territorial Army, accusing . him of being ‘utterly incompetent’ and ‘woefully inadequate’ and giving a . strong suggestion that he considered him a bore.","David Cameron was shouted down as he launched attack on Labour .

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . Booming: Britons spend more than £1,200 each online every year, the most of any nation surveyed . The British spend far more online than any other nation in the world at an average of £1,175 per head, amid a dramatic shift in shopping habits. The figure is far ahead of the rest of the world, including the USA, and some £307 more than in the second ranked country, Australia. The shift has far-reaching implications for the nation’s high streets where tens of thousands of empty shops will need to be bulldozed. Recent studies suggest the nation’s town centres need to be dramatically remodelled to bring in more housing, schools, gyms and community facilities. Most people said the reasons for the shift to the web were because it was cheaper and easier, without the hassle, time and parking costs involved in going in to town. Three in four people (73 per cent) with web access in the UK are buying goods for delivery over the internet at least once a month. One in four do so every week, with internet shopping for groceries more developed in the UK than anywhere else in the world. Smartphones, such as the iPhone or Samsung Galaxy, with their access to the internet and online video have been adopted more enthusiastically in Britain than virtually any other country. Some 71 per cent of mobile users access the internet on their handset, which ranks second only to Spain, where it is 75 per cent. Companies trying to reach shoppers via advertising through smartphones are spending more per head in this country than anywhere else – at £8.04. Japan came in second with £7.50 per head, while it was an average of £6.74 in the US. Behemoth: It is good news for the ever-growing online shopping firm Amazon, whose giant 'fulfilment centre' warehouse in Peterborough, pictured, has come in for criticism over its employment practices . Relentless: Amazon staff pick up an order every 33 seconds. The firm may even start using delivery drones . The internet is also changing the way . we watch television. The British are most likely to access TV content . over the web, with over a third (36 per cent) doing so every week. Social networks, particularly Facebook, are among the most searched-for terms online, while the  photo sharing website ‘Instagram’ was the fastest growing term in the UK, the US, Canada, and Ireland. The study, which was compiled by . Ofcom, compared the internet, mobile and TV services across 17 countries . across the world, including the U.S., much of Europe and the Far East. It found that YouTube was the most popular website for online video content, with two-thirds of the nation’s laptop and desktop users visiting the site every month. Ofcom said: ‘In recent years, we have found that the UK is the country where online shopping is most popular, with the highest spend per head of all of our comparator countries.’ The figure of at £1,175 per head in 2012 compares to £867 in Australia and £663 in the USA. At the other end of the scale, the figure was just £180 in Spain and £126 in Italy. Total online web spending in this country was £74.3billion in 2012 and it appears likely to rise by at least another 10per cent this year. In Britain, some 59 per cent of shoppers said it was cheaper to shop online, while 58 per cent said it was easier, 50 per cent argued it was quicker and 47 per cent felt it offered a better choice. At one time, it was believed selling clothes online would never work because people like to try things on. However the sale of clothes and shoes over the web is now among the fastest growing sectors, thanks to the success of firms like Asos and the department stores, which have easy returns policies. The British were also most likely to trust web retailers and that goods bought online would be delivered speedily. However, there are some concerns about delivery charges with four in ten saying they are too high, while three in ten had some concerns that purchases might not arrive. Amazon suffered a backlash earlier this year when it scrapped free delivery on some items that cost less than £10. There have also been complaints about couriers and postmen dumping items in places where they may be stolen. The research found that 19 per cent of Britons said they did not shop online more often because of concerns about collecting their item if they missed the delivery. Derelict: One in seven high street shops is empty, a figure which threatens to rise with more online sales .","We spend £300 more each than the next-highest ranked country, Australia .

"By . MailOnline Reporter . A Wisconsin beautician who is accused of strangling her ex-boyfriend's dog with its choke collar after breaking into his home following an argument has had her charges upgraded to a felony. Selina Boulton, 32, was arrested in December 2013 after the November 14 incident, but on Friday prosecutors elevated charges to mistreatment of animals, a felony, and disorderly conduct. Boulton's preliminary hearing will be August 15 in La Crosse County Circuit Court. The scorned lover was charged in December with two misdemeanors. Charged: Selina Boulton allegedly strangled her ex-boyfriend's aged dog with its collar after an argument . Prosecutors argued she killed the . 13-year-old Basset Hound, Jixer, after breaking into her ex's house in . the 700 block of North Losey Boulevard. Police found the dog dead on the floor with its choke collar cinched tightly to its neck and a frying pan nearby, according to Twincities.com. An autopsy found the pet died of asphyxiation/respiratory failure as a result of severe trauma.Jixer also suffered fractured ribs, a collapsed lung and a cut consistent with a stab wound, according to court records. Boulton reportedly told investigators Jixer bit her when she entered the house and she denied breaking and entering. She had a blood alcohol level of 0.10 per cent after the incident. Scene: She allegedly broke into her ex-boyfriend's house on the 700 Block of Losey Blvd in La Crosse, pictured center, last month after arguing with him. The man found her crying in his bedroom . The beautician broke into the . unidentified man's house following an argument and tortured his . 13-year-old basset hound until it died, prosecutors said in December. On . November 14, her ex-boyfriend came home to Boulton crying in his . bedroom beside the dead body of his beloved dog, Jixer, who had . apparently been strangled by his own collar. The animal was also beside a frying pan and after further investigation, authorities learned he also had fractured ribs, a collapsed lung and a cut that appeared to be a stab wound. A necropsy found Jixer had died of asphyxiation/respiratory failure after severe thoracic trauma - that is, trauma to the chest. Boulton told investigators that the aged dog had bit her when she entered the house - but denied breaking in. Tortured: She denied hurting the pet but said it was four years past its life expectancy anyway (file picture) She added that the dog was four years past its life expectancy and complained that 'an animal has more rights than I do'. The . alleged attack came after Boulton had gone out with her ex-boyfriend . but the former couple began arguing when he refused to allow her into . his house, the La Crosse Tribune reported. Police said that she then broke into his house through the kitchen window. She had a 0.10 per cent alcohol blood level when police arrived. After initially speaking with authorities, the ex-boyfriend wrote a letter asking prosecutors to drop all charges against Boulton. He said he believed the dog died of a heart attack when it saw Boulton climb through a window. 'She didn't kill my dog,' he wrote. Boulton, who trained as an esthetician according to public records, has been banned from having contact with any animals as a condition of her $1,000 bond.","Selina Boulton 'strangled 13-year-old Jixer with his collar, fractured his ribs and stabbed him' after arguing with her ex-boyfriend, police said .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Playing golf is about to get a whole lot easier - as courses across the U.S. introduce a 15-inch hole on the putting green. The hole will be boosted from 4 inches to 15 inches in a pilot scheme - which is to be trialled at 100 courses across the country. It is hoped the move will improve player's scores, increase game speed and encourage more . beginners to take up the sport - which has lost around five million players . in the U.S. alone over the past 10 years. The average size of a golf hole is to be increased to 15inches in a pilot scheme which will be introduced to 100 courses across the U.S. and Canada. It is hoped the move will encourage more people to take up the sport . Sergio Garcia, pictured during day one of the 2012 Open Championship at Royal Lytham & St. Annes Golf Club, says the holes will help encourage more beginners to take up the sport . The new holes, which will be about the . size of an average pizza, have the backing of Ted Bishop, the president . of the Professional Golfers Association of America. He said: 'We’ve got to stop scaring people away from golf by telling them that there is only one way to play the game.' The Reynolds Plantation in Greensboro, Georgia, is to install the 15-inch holes. Top players Sergio García and Justin Rose played on the new course during a promotional event held last month. At the event, Mr Garcia said: 'A 15in hole could help junior golfers, beginning golfers and older golfers score better, play faster and like golf more.' One course in Canada, the Redwoods Golf Course in Langley, British Columbia, is also to install the larger holes. Doug Hawley, managing director of the course, told CBC News : 'Younger folks just don't think it's cool. 'Golf hasn't really grown. It hasn't really declined. It's just staying stable. Tiger Woods reacts to he misses a putt on the 14th green during the 2008 masters in Georgia. The game has slipped in popularity across the country - with five million people abandoning the game in the past decade . Justin Rose misses a putt on 18th hole at the European Ryder Cup. The sport is thought to have originated in Scotland in the 15th Century - although some suggest it originates from the Roman game paganica . 'If you can take out some of the frustration out the game ... the more relaxed they are, the more they'll enjoy their day, and the more they'll want to come back.' According to the National Golf Foundation, the sport has lost about 5million US players in a decade. Their research found that players under the age of 35, many of whom say it is too difficult, are most likely to give up playing. Nobody was available from the golf's professional body, The R&A, to comment on the changes. Golf historians differ as to where the game originated. Some say it originated in Scotland in the 15th Century. However, others insist the sport dates back to the Roman game of paganica - where players used a bent stick to hit a leather ball. Certain historians say paganica spread through Europe as the Romans conquered the continent before it developed into the modern game. A boost in hole size is far from the only change in golfing history. Until the fifties, a golfer was not allowed to move an opponent's ball if it fell in front of theirs. After a series of revisions, the so-called Stymie Rule was abolished in 1952. Until 1974, golfers were allowed to use a ball that was 1.62inches in diameter in the British Open - but it was made illegal in 1988. Since then, the United States Golf Association's 1.68inch diameter model has been the only one allowed. Currently, if a player wishes to drop their ball back in to play, they must extend their arm out in from of them and drop it from shoulder height. Until 1984, the ball had to be dropped over the shoulder. Previously, players were penalised if an element beyond their control caused their ball to move on the green. However, after several high-profile players were affected, the USGA took action and from 2012, players are allowed to play from the new spot if their ball moves due to reasons beyond their control. Those using long putters - such as Adam Scott and Webb Simpson - were hit with a shake-up last year. Although the 2013 USGA rule doesn't completely ban long putters - which are, as the name suggests, longer versions of their regular counterparts -  it prohibits players from anchoring them to their body during the stroke. Following the controversial ruling, USGA Executive Director Mike Davis said: 'This decision gets back to the USGA and R&A feeling that fundamentally golf for 600 years has been about picking up the club, gripping it with two hands and making a free swing away from the body.'","Courses across the US to increase 4-inch hole to 15 inches .

"By . James  Nye . It is going to cost Brussels $10.4 million to host Barack Obama on his first presidential visit to the Belgian capital. Even for the headquarters of the European Union and NATO the astronomical sum has raised eyebrows - especially as President Obama intends on spending only 24 hours in the historic city. Bringing with him a personal diplomatic and security entourage of 900 people and three cargo planes carrying 45 vehicles, the visit is also being policed by 350 police and military on motorbikes to secure the president's routes to EU and NATO summits on Wednesday. Arrival: U.S. President Barack Obama, center, steps off of Air Force One at Zaventem airport in Brussels on Tuesday, March 25, 2014. Obama is on a one day visit to Belgium to meet with EU leaders and visit the WWI Flanders Fields American Cemetery . Expensive trip: U.S. President Barack Obama arrives at Brussels Airport March 25, 2014 where he will attend the EU summit in Brussels . The president has been conspicuously projecting American power during his tour of Europe - arriving in Amsterdam on Monday flanked by a squadron of Marine-Corp gunships. The show of force was undeniably for the benefit of Russian President Putin who has angered the international community with his unilateral annexation of Crimea. The President landed on Tuesday night in Air Force One and was escorted in his armored car, nicknamed 'The Beast' to his hotel in the upmarket Toison d'Or shopping district. Advanced security teams have already combed every inch of Brussels, including the sewers and all major hospitals have been briefed. Security: U.S. President Barack Obama and his presidential limo nicknamed 'The Beast' appear in front of Air Force One as his Secret Service team check all is clear at an airfield in Minnesota last year . But for a city that hosts at least four EU summits a year that witness the visit of British, French and German leaders, this is expensive. Usually those summits cost Brussels $690,000, 'But this time round, you can multiply that figure by 20,' said Brussels mayor, Yvan Mayeur. Indeed, the city will raise its security level from two to three - with four being the most serious. There will be a ring of steel around The Hotel - a former Hilton - where the president will spend his only night. The city has readied 350 extra military and police to line the route for the presidential convoy as Obama attends NATO and EU summits on Wednesday. Making an entrance: A US helicopter squadron carrying Barack Obama advances to land on the 'Museumplein' in Amsterdam on Monday for the emergency summit to discuss how to punish Russia for annexing Ukraine's Crimea region . Crisis talks: U.S. President Barack Obama salutes as he arrives at the Rijksmuseum on the Museumplein in Amsterdam for a two-day Nuclear Security Summit in The Hague on Monday . Following that the same convoy of Marine-Corp helicopters will transport the president to an American first world war cemetery where he will meet Belgium's King Philippe and Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo. After that he will return to the Belgian capital for a meeting with European Council president, Herman Van Rompuy, and the European Commission president, José Manuel Barroso. From there he will travel to NATO's headquarters for a summit with its secretary-general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen. The president spent Monday in Amsterdam and The Hague and will leave Brussels on Wednesday evening to fly to Rome for his first meeting with Pope Francis. A presidential visit of this scale however, is not unique. Delivered the Presidential payload: A US helicopter squadron return after flying US President Obama to the Rijksmuseum on Schiphol airport in Amsterdam on Monday . Touch down: The helicopter squadron made a dramatic entrance when they touched down in Amsterdam on Monday . President George W. Bush took 700 people with him to London in November 2003, months before the UK and US invasion of Iraw. At the time, The Guardian described the visit as 'worthy of a traveling medieval monarch' and the trip cost the British government $8 million. Indeed, presidential trips set the taxpayer back enormously. The Washington Post reported in June 2013, that the Obama family trip to Africa cost the government anywhere between $60 and $100 million. Busy week: Obama was in Amsterdam to attend a G7 meeting to discuss how to punish Russia for annexing Ukraine's Crimea region, including possibly excluding Moscow from the G8 club of rich nations, and to attend the two-day Nuclear Security Summit (NSS) in the Hague . And the winner of the best car door goes to... The door to Barack Obama's car was a foot thicker than everybody else's, . including that of British Prime Minister David Cameron as they both attended the summit in Amsterdam on Monday . Russia's President Vladimir Putin speaks during an awarding ceremony in the Kremlin in Moscow, on March 25, 2014.  Russia said today its suspension from the G8 was counterproductive . The U.S. President, who accused Putin of trying to 'intimidate' Ukraine by amassing troops within striking distance of major cities such as Donetsk and Kharkiv, is pressed his western allies to support tougher sanctions against Russia, even if they risk hurting the continent's economies. In an interview with the Dutch newspaper de Volkskrant published ahead of his arrival, President Obama said his message to European leaders is that Putin needs to 'understand the economic and political consequences of his actions in Ukraine.' But he stopped short of suggesting Europe as a battleground between the East and the West, adding: 'That's the kind of thinking that should have ended with the Cold War. On the contrary, it's important that Ukraine have good relations with the United States, Russia, and Europe.'","President Obama's 24-hour stay in Brussels is costing Belgium $10.4 million in extra security .

"By . Associated Press . and Peter Rugg . A New Jersey man who said he was high on drugs and hearing voices when he fatally beat an elderly man with a sauce pan has been convicted of murder. The Record reports that a Bergen County jury deliberated for about 90 minutes Tuesday before convicting 22-year-old Edwin Estrada, of Cliffside Park. He also was found guilty of weapons offenses, burglary, robbery and credit-card theft charges. Edwin Estrada is led out of the courtroom after he was found guilty of murder in the fatal beating of an elderly man with a sauce pan . Prosecutors say Estrada attacked and robbed 88-year-old Vincent Leuzzi in the victim's Fairview home in July 2010. Estrada claimed he was not legally responsible for the murder because he was high on PCP and marijuana and was urged on by the voice of the devil. Leuzzi died of blunt force trauma caused by at least nine blows. North Jersey reports he now faces possible life in prison and a minimum of 30 years. An . expert witness for the prosecution testified Estrada fabricated his . claims, and that they were at odds with his presence of mind later that . day to go shopping and get dinner before leaving town. 'I tend to agree with the state's psychiatrist that it was a manipulation and not true,' said Leuzzi's stepdaughter Filomena Mazzone.

"By . Peter Rugg . State and local authorities are now investigating the death of John P. Gleeson Jr. who's family claims he begged for medical attention as an inmate at the Nassau County Jail but was ignored until it was too late. The Nassau County corrections investigator Capt. Michael Golio told reporters the death of Gleeson Jr., 40, is now under investigation by the New York State Commission of Corrections, the Nassau County Police Department, and the jail's health care providers. 'The death of Mr. Gleeson is under investigation by numerous . agencies,' Golio said. 'The Sheriff’s Department is . cooperating and assisting with these investigations.' State and local authorities are now investigating the death of John P. Gleeson Jr. who's family claims he begged for medical attention as an inmate at the Nassau County Jail but was ignored until it was too late. Tragic loss: Family members say John Gleeson Jr., pictured here with his two children, died after Nassau County jail guards ignored his pleas for medical treatment while incarcerated . The Post reports the Gleeson family attorney James Pascarella is also leading his own independent investigation. 'He was in a Nassau County correctional facility,' Pascarella told the paper. 'Any way you want to slice it, it’s their responsibility to . keep him safe. It’s their responsibility to take care of any health . issues he has. It appears that wasn’t done here and that’s . unacceptable.' Should an investigation show that the jail staff's action were criminal, Pascarella has promised to push for a prosecution. Gleeson Jr.'s death is now under investigation by the New York State Commission of Correction, the Nassau County Police Department, and the jail's health care providers . 'We’re doing our own investigation and, absolutely, if there’s . potential criminality, we will contact the DA’s office,' Pascarella said. 'We . want to make sure that, one, this never happens to anyone again, and . two, that John’s memory is preserved and that justice prevails here.' While Nassau County DA Kathleen Rice does is looking into the death, her office has not officially opened an investigation. On July 14, the Gleeson Jr. told the jail's guards he was experiencing pain and swelling from his hands to his chest and neck. He told them that he had a medical condition and that such swelling showed it had reached life-threatening levels. After hours went by without treatment, Gleeson passed out and was rushed to Nassau County Medical Center. He was pronounced dead at the hospital. Family say Gleeson Jr. told prison guards that he had a medical condition and that such swelling showed it had reached life-threatening levels but was ignored . Gleeson Jr. was jailed on . May 22 after being charged with petit larceny for stealing a manhole . cover from an Oceanside parking lot. His father, John Gleeson Sr., told Mail Online he refused to bail him out because he wanted to teach his son a lesson by leaving him in a Long Island jail. But . weeks later the retired FDNY captain received the devastating phone . call that John Gleeson Jr. had died while incarcerated. 'I didn’t bail him out,' Gleeson Sr. said. 'I said, ‘Let him get his act together.' 'He was down on his luck, trying to get scrap metal from abandoned . buildings, whatever he could get his hands on,' his father told The Post. Repentant: Gleeson Jr., pictured here with his children, had struggled with opiates in the past but was described as 'contrite' and ready to move forward with his life by family members . His family received the news when a correction officer called their home and reached Gleeson's mother, Margaret. Gleeson Sr. recounted the phone call: 'Are you John Gleeson’s mother?' 'Yes.' 'Well, he expired.' 'My wife started to scream and he [the man on the phone] said, ‘You . want more information, call the Nassau County Medical Center,’ and he . hung up,' Gleeson Sr. said. The Nassau County Sheriff’s Department has not responded to requests for comment. According to a family friend who works at the jail, the last hours of Gleeson's life were filled with terrible pain that went entirely ignored. 'They give him a Benadryl,' his outraged father told Mail Online. 'Then that doesn't work, an hour later they give him another Benadryl. He's sitting there in pain. I don't care what you did, you deserve to be treated like a human being.' The family knew something was off when Gleeson Jr. did not call home at his normal 6:30 p.m. time, but it would be hours before they had any idea how bad the situation was. Jailed: Gleeson's father, John Gleeson Sr., said he refused to bail his son, pictured, out of jail because he thought he needed tough love . Gleeson Sr. said that despite the fact his son was unable to speak he was not removed from his cell and taken to the hospital until 10:30 p.m. He was declared dead half-an-hour later. Gleeson Sr. told Mail Online that over the course of his son's month-and-a-half incarceration, the tough love seemed to be working. 'He was clean and sober,' he said. 'He missed his kids. He was contrite, talking about how he wanted to put his life together. 'It's beyond obscene.' Gleeson Jr. left behind a son John, 10, and a daughter Erin, 12. He had previously been arrested for forging an oxycodone prescription and had struggled with opiate addiction.","John P.

The mystery of Arizona Cardinals outside linebacker John Abraham's recent absence from training camp may have been uncovered with the revelation that the NFL star was charged with driving under the influence while leaving a Georgia strip club in late June. ESPN reports that Abraham was found unconscious in the driver's seat of his black Dodge Challenger at roughly 4 p.m. June 29 shortly after exiting the Pink Pony strip club. According to the police report it took officers several minutes of hammering on the car door to wake the NFL's active sacks leader. Outside linebacker John Abraham was found unconscious in the driver's seat of his black Dodge Challenger at roughly 4 p.m. June 29 shortly after exiting the Pink Pony strip club . Abraham was allegedly leaving the Pink Pony strip club in the late afternoon when police found him . 'He appeared confused and rambled while speaking,' according to a TMZ review of the police report. The 36-year-old failed multiple field sobriety tests but reportedly declined a breathalyzer. An officer confiscated his South Carolina driver's license which was found to be under suspension. When questioned about Abraham's three-day absence from training camp during a Monday morning appearing on Arizona Sports 620, Cardinals general manager Steve Keim dismissed speculation anything was wrong. 'I'm not concerned at all,' he said on the Doug and Wolf show. 'He'll be back at some point here.' As AZ Central notes, this is the second time Abraham has faced DUI charges. He was busted after crashing his SUV into a Long Island fire hydrant while playing for the New York Jets in 2003. In that case, he pled guilty to driving while impaired. He did not serve jail time. Abraham is currently NFL's active sacks leader. Cardinal's coach Bruce Arians declined to comment on what the June incident meant for Abraham's status with the team. Cornerback Patrick Peterson was more forgiving. 'He made a mistake. And he's still our brother. So we'll have to love on . him,' Peterson told reporters. 'We'll have to care for him, and hopefully he won't make this . mistake again to put this negative light on the Arizona Cardinals . football team. We're looking to move forward from it. We can't wait to . get him back just [to] see what kind of health and conditioning that . he's in, and we're hoping that he can put up another double-digit sack . season.'","Abraham was found unconscious in his Dodge Challenger and failed several field sobriety tests .

"By . Peter Rugg . An Arkansas man in custody for allegedly killing his pregnant girlfriend claims he has no memory of assaulting her. Douglas True, 21, reportedly dialed 911 for Fort Smith Police at around 11:52 a.m. on Sunday, asking that they come to a home on the 2900 block of South 66th Street. He waved them into the driveway, and upon entering the house police discovered the body of Briana Butler stabbed to death and lying on the bathroom floor. She was 22 years old and seven months pregnant. Scroll down for video . Police say Briana Butler was found stabbed to death seven months into a pregnancy this Sunday after a fight with her boyfriend . Douglas True, 21, told police that he had fought with Butler but had no memory of stabbing her to death . Butler's daughter Bonnie, 2, was discovered sleeping in a nearby room with minor facial injuries, KFSM reports. The toddler was immediately transported to a local hospital and should make a full recovery. Upon searching the home police recovered a knife they believe was used in the homicide, and it was later confirmed that lacerations on her throat and torso were consistent with knife wounds. True was arrested on suspicion of two charges of capital murder for her and her unborn child. He has been transferred to Sebastian County Detention Center to be held without bond. Police say True called his mother to say he'd done a terrible thing and would spend his life in prison . 'True was advised of his rights and gave a statement admitting that he and Butler got into an argument that escalated to a physical altercation,' according to an affidavit. 'True stated that he was intoxicated and did not remember what happened after that. True said that he got up in the middle of the night and found Butler's body in the bathroom and went back to the couch and passed out.' The next morning he woke up, cut a cast off his arm, then called his mother to tell her he'd done something bad and would spend the rest of his life in prison. Chief deputy prosecutor Linda Ward told the Times Record the investigation will continue before charges are filed. Butler's ex-husband and father of Bonnie, Joshua Butler, told WHBS that Bonnie had been an attentive and conscientious mother. Because Butler was pregnant, as this sonogram shows, True is being charged with two murders . 'No human being deserves to be done like that,' said Butler's ex-husband and father of Bonnie, Joshua Butler. 'To take your anger and rage out on another person and just totally take . them out, I mean that's just, cowardly right there' Eyewitness Barry Wayne, who saw True's arrest, said that a niece living in the complex where the crime took palce told him she was scared something had happened. 'She had never been in nothing like this before,' he said, 'I seen . three or four police cars and then I was sitting on the porch, and I . seen a gentlemen in the back and they said he had murdered her.' He said the girl would move out soon. 'You never know what’s going on in a person’s mind, so you always got . to be careful,' he said, 'You never know what’s going on with that . person.'","Douglas True, 21, called police Sunday to report a crime .

"By . Peter Rugg . A new regulation now bans drones from all national parks in the United States. The National Park Service has outlawed launching, landing, or operating drones on or over federally operated lands and waters, and was signed into effect by director Jonathan Jarvis on June 27. The NPS manages all of the country's national parks, monuments, and various historical sites. A new regulation now bans drones from all national parks in the United States . 'We . embrace many activities in national parks because they enhance visitor . experience with the iconic natural, historic and cultural landscapes in . our care,' Jarvis said, according to Yahoo. 'However' he continued, 'we have serious concerns about the negative impact that . flying unmanned aircraft is having in parks, so we are prohibiting their . use until we can determine the most appropriate policy that will . protect park resources and provide all visitors with a rich experience.' Parks have been banning drone use within their boundaries for some time. Yosemite National Park in California banned drones in its boundaries this May. Several parks have had complaints from visitors about the noise and distraction drones can cause . NPS reported such flying bots were often used to capture aerial views of the Yosemite landscape. The hope is that the ban will eliminate many noise and nuisance complaints and help ensure safety. In September, rangers in Mount Rushmore captured a drone that flew over the National Memorial amphitheater in South Dakota. Then in April, visitors to the Grand Canyon complained about noise from a drone that crashed into the canyon. Exemptions could still be made for drones if they're being used for search-and-rescue missions or scientific study . Still, the NPS may make drone exceptions if they can be used for search-and-rescue operations or fire safety and scientific study missions. However such exemptions would require special approval. The ban is meant as a temporary measure as the government assesses how to best pilot the machines over populated areas. The rules will not affect Federal Aviation Administration regulations, and that body is currently developing rules for commercial drone use.","New regulation went into effect in June .

"By . Peter Rugg . John Gleeson Sr. only wanted to teach his son a lesson by leaving him in a Long Island jail. But  weeks later the retired FDNY captain received the devastating phone call that John Gleeson Jr. had died while incarcerated. 'I didn’t bail him out,' Gleeson Sr. said. 'I said, ‘Let him get his act together.' John P. Gleeson Jr., 40, was jailed on May 22 after being charged with petit larceny for stealing a manhole cover from an Oceanside parking lot. John Gleeson Snr., his wife and his son John Gleeson Jnr: Before the tragic accident the family are ssen in this happy picture . Tragic loss: Family members say John Gleeson Jr., pictured here with his two children, died after Nassau County jail guards ignored his pleas for medical treatment while incarcerated . Family say Gleeson Jr. told prison guards that he had a medical condition and that such swelling showed it had reached life-threatening levels but was ignored . 'He was down on his luck, trying to get scrap metal from abandoned . buildings, whatever he could get his hands on,' his father told The Post. He was then locked up in the Nassau County Jail. On July 14, the younger Gleeson told the guards he was experiencing pain and swelling from his hands to his chest and neck. He told them that he had a medical condition and that such swelling showed it had reached life-threatening levels. After hours went by without treatment, Gleeson passed out and was rushed to Nassau County Medical Center. He was pronounced dead at the hospital. Repentant: Gleeson Jr., pictured here with his children, had struggled with opiates in the past but was described as 'contrite' and ready to move forward with his life by family members . His family received the news when a correction officer called their home and reached Gleeson's mother, Margaret. Gleeson Sr. recounted the phone call: 'Are you John Gleeson’s mother?' 'Yes.' 'Well, he expired.' 'My wife started to scream and he [the man on the phone] said, ‘You . want more information, call the Nassau County Medical Center,’ and he . hung up,' Gleeson Sr. said. The Nassau County Sheriff’s Department has not responded to requests for comment. According to a family friend who works at the jail, the last hours of Gleeson's life were filled with terrible pain that went entirely ignored. 'They give him a Benadryl,' his outraged father told Mail Online. 'Then that doesn't work, an hour later they give him another Benadryl. He's sitting there in pain. I don't care what you did, you deserve to be treated like a human being.' The family knew something was off when Gleeson Jr. did not call home at his normal 6:30 p.m. time, but it would be hours before they had any idea how bad the situation was. Jailed: Gleeson's father, John Gleeson Sr., said he refused to bail his son, pictured, out of jail because he thought he needed tough love . Gleeson Sr. said that despite the fact his son was unable to speak he was not removed from his cell and taken to the hospital until 10:30 p.m. He was declared dead half-an-hour later. Gleeson Sr. told Mail Online that over the course of his son's month-and-a-half incarceration, the tough love seemed to be working. 'He was clean and sober,' he said. 'He missed his kids. He was contrite, talking about how he wanted to put his life together. 'It's beyond obscene.' Gleeson Jr. left behind a son John, 10, and a daughter Erin, 12. He had previously been arrested for forging an oxycodone prescription and had struggled with opiate addiction. Gleeson Sr. added that he has recently retained an attorney but that any potential legal action is still in early discussions.","John P.

"By . Peter Rugg . A pair of documentary filmmakers have hit on a gimmick to attract viewers that should put 3D to shame, by promising free marijuana at screenings of their new movie. The appropriately named director Anthony Hashem and producer Adam Hartle announced the giveaway in conjunction with screenings of documentary Mile High: The Comeback of Cannabis. The film chronicles Colorado's legalization of recreational marijuana. High art: Filmmakers Anthony Hashem and Adam Hartle hope free marijuana samples might draw viewers to their new pot documentary . 'I'll be standing outside the Mayan and Boulder theaters before each screening this week, handing out a small amount of legal marijuana to anyone over 21 with a valid ID to take home and enjoy . The film chronicles the struggle to legalize marijuana in Colorado . responsibly,' Hartle told Deadline. 'No purchase necessary,' he added. 'But we highly encourage you to stay and watch the film.' The film follows the legislation efforts to pass and implement Colorado's Amendment 46, which created a system for growing, distributing, and selling legal marijuana. It also features vignettes of Hartle's stand-up comedy. 'We’ve shown this film to a few test audiences so far, and what we’ve found is the 20- to 40-year-old demographic who have used cannabis before absolutely love it, and the older crowd who hasn’t find it less favorable,' Hashem said. The film opens Tuesday at Denver's Mayan Theatre. Tongue in cheek, Deadline noted that rather than complain about the new incentive, theater owers may hope for it to hike concession sales. Sadly there are no 4:20 p.m. showtimes.","Doc Mile High: The Comeback of Cannabis, focuses on Colorado's legalization of marijuana .

"By . Peter Rugg . An Oklahoma teenager was burned so badly during an explosion that doctors said his wounds were typically only seen during autopsies. Dalton Henry, 15, was burned while helping his older cousin burn brush, and though his memories of the day are fuzzy he admitted that he had been told several times to leave the gas can alone but did not listen. Mother Carrie Henry told KFOR she saw the explosion from her kitchen window. Dalton Henry, 15, was severely burned while helping his older cousin burn brush when a gas can exploded . 'I just prayed to God that it wouldn’t be bad . and it was,' she said. 'I wish he would have just listened and not picked up that gas can,' she continued. 'It’s a very, very hard lesson for him, a very hard lesson.' After he was injured in February, doctors told the family his road to recovery would be long and arduous. The family has since set up a GoFundMe to help offset medical costs. While progress is slow, his family said it is still miraculous. 'Sometimes they say two weeks, three weeks and it turns into months,' Carrie said. And with several surgeries still ahead, the process has taken its toll on the family. 'I do my best not to cry every time I look at him,' she says. 'It just about kills me that he got burnt that bad.' She's quit her job so she can take care of Dalton full-time, and says she now knows her son is a fighter. 'I said you fought. You fought hard,' she says. 'You know, you’re a strong boy. Never once did he cry.' As he heals, he's been able to go fishing and even swim this summer. 'He’ll never be 100% back where he was, no. But even if it’s halfway . or 75% back, that would be just awesome,' Carrie says. And while most of the procedures have gone well the family is considering legal advice regarding the mishandling of skin grafts at a Dallas hospital that's left the teen missing two fingers.","Dalton Henry, 15, was burned after picking up gas can during brush burn .

"By . David Mccormack . and Peter Rugg . Rather than apologizing for his drunken rant in a viral video in which he declared his father owned 'half of Manhattan,' NYU student Gerry Shalam has decided to go on the offensive by threatening to sue the people who embarrassed him. The New York Post reports that legal action was hinted in a statement from attorney Darren Oved. 'This is a . shameful exploitation of a young man who was clearly protecting himself . and his friends from unwanted intrusions into their private lives at a . vulnerable moment,' Oved states. Scroll down for more . NYU student Gerry Shalam, 20, wants to sue the people who posted a video of his drunken rant that left him the talk of the internet . 'Our client takes this blatant violation of his civil . rights seriously and intends to take all appropriate measures to ensure . that this video’s publishers and all those who have and continue to . disseminate it are held legally accountable.' Shalam, . 20, provides plenty of laughs in the short video clip in which he . attempts to intimidate the person filming him with some rather grandiose . - and seriously ill-judged – boasts. ‘This . your property? My dad is in f**kin’ real estate, you’re gonna tell me . this your property? My dad owns half of f**king Manhattan,’ the student . from Allenhurst, New Jersey screams at the cameraman. The footage starts with Shalam and his equally well-oiled friends causing a nuisance outside a dry cleaners on 28th Street in Manhattan. A blonde girl attempts to help a man in a blue shirt stand up straight, while Shalam takes issues with the man filming them. The man with the camera explains that his is unhappy about them loitering on his property and so Shalam attempts to one up him by claiming that his father is in real estate and 'owns half of f**king Manhattan.' When asked his name, Shalam responds 'Gerry Adjmi,' adding later that 'I’m a f**king lawyer.' The footage starts with Shalam and his equally well-oiled friends causing a nuance outside a dry cleaners on 28th Street in Manhattan . Shalam apparently used the phony surname because his drunken friend - who by this point is on the pavement - is himself an Adjmi, a wealthy New York real estate family who don’t own half of Manhattan either. Eventually the drunken students depart the scene, but not before Shalam utters another classic lines: 'You think I don't own the cops?' and ‘Do you want me to call [New York City Mayor] Bill de Blasio on you right now?’ Since waking up with a hangover and realizing his embarrassing exploits are all other the internet, Shalam has done his best to disappear by deleting his Facebook and Instagram accounts. Unfortunately for Gerry, he wasn’t able to delete everything about him online and The Smoking Gun has reported that surprise, surprise, Gary wasn’t being totally honest with his idle boasts. His father isn’t a property magnate, but rather Lou Shalam is a garment industry executive, while his mother Frieda is an event coordinator and member of the Allenhurst Borough zoning and planning board. Shalam's attorney has called the video a violation of his client's civil rights . Perhaps deservedly Shalam is receiving a lot of scathing criticism online for being ‘over-privileged’ and ‘an insufferable rich-kid.’ But it appears this member of NYU’s Class of 2017 isn’t all bad and his accomplishments include co-founding a charitable organization called Brothers Helping Others that helps low-income immigrant families in Asbury Park, New Jersey. If this latest incident wasn’t embarrassing enough for Salam, it has also helped to shine a spotlight on his past as a former thespian. At age 13, he played the Scarecrow in a community center production of Hip Hop Wiz, a Wizard of Oz adaptation produced by his mother. The musical included 'unbelievable hip hop dance routines' and a script that 'was recreated with a Syrian twist,' according to a YouTube clip.

"By . Jonathan Block . 'I'd like an opportunity to prove my innocence,' Richard DeCoatsworth, 28, told a judge today. 'If I were a guilty man, the offer the commonwealth presented would be a good one.' At the hearing, the judge also said DeCoatsworth is too dangerous to be freed while awaiting trial, which is scheduled for November. Former Philadelphia police officer Richard DeCoatsworth (right), accused of raping two women at gunpoint, was seated next to First Lady Michelle Obama (left) and Dr Jill Biden (right) during the president's televised February 2009 address to Congress . If DeCoatsworth had accepted the plea, . he would have likely left prison with time served, about 10 months. However, he now faces several decades in prison if convicted of the most . serious charge. In June, a grand jury indicted him on charges of rape, sexual assault, intent to possess or distribute drugs, human . trafficking, promoting prostitution, witness intimidation and related . offenses in a May 16, 2013 incident involving two women. According . to court documents, the former cop met the alleged victims at a party . and took them to a house in north Philadelphia where the alleged . incidents took place. Heroic actions: DeCoatsworth was invited to attend the speech by Vice President Joe Biden after he was shot in the face but still managed to chase after his attacker . DeCoatsworth was hailed as a hero after . he was shot in the face during a traffic stop in September 2007 but . still managed to chase after his attacker, who was later sentenced to 36 . to 72 years in prison. 'The shot to the face changed his life forever. It really altered him,' his lawyer, A. Charles Peruto, told the Associated Press. 'He had his face reconstructed. The pain has been immeasurable.' Valiant: A bullet struck DeCoatsworth in the mouth during a routine traffic stop in September 2007, but he still went in pursuit of his assailant before collapsing and radioing for help . As a result of his heroic actions, DeCoatsworth was invited by Vice President Joe . Biden to attend the president's televised February 2009 address to . Congress and sat with first lady Michelle Obama. In a June bail hearing, Assistant District Attorney Joseph McGlynn told a judge that when SWAT teams searched DeCoatsworth's home two days after the alleged rapes it appeared he was about to 'take his last stand' as they found three loaded guns - a shotgun, Glock and revolver - as well as prescription pills and drug paraphernalia. McGlynn said the former cop had become a 'dangerous and scary person, someone the public needs to be protected from.' Defense attorney L. George Parry argued that DeCoatsworth was an 'addict' because of pain pills he began taking after getting shot while on duty. He also pointed out that he owns his guns legally and one of the women was a prostitute when he first solicited her. History of violence: Before leaving the force, DeCoatsworth was involved in two others incidents in April and September of 2009 where he shot two suspects .","Former Philadelphia police officer Richard DeCoatsworth, 28, withdrew a plea agreement that would have likely allowed him to leave prison with time served .
