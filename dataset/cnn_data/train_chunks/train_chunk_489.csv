A top Hollywood banker who is suing the Los Angeles police after officers allegedly beat him up claimed to have taken bath salts just two days earlier, it has been revealed. Brian Mulligan, who serves as vice chairman of media for Deutsche Bank, claims he was brutally attacked by the LAPD, leaving him bruised, bloodied, and with lacerations across his face. He has denied allegations by the police that he had admitted taking marijuana and bath salts - but he was recorded talking to an officer about his drug use just two days before the LAPD encounter, according to CBS This Morning. Scroll down for video . Bruised and broken: Deutsche Bank's Brian Mulligan, pictured left, before surgery, and right, after surgery to repair various lacerations and a nasal fracture; he alleges he was attacked by the LAPD last May . Mulligan, 53, was stopped by the LAPD . three times on the night of May 15 last year - the third time when he . was seen allegedly trying to break in to moving cars. When . officers tried to subdue him, the high-profile executive was injured, . and eventually when to hospital with multiple facial lacerations and a . broken nose. The police . report on the incident claimed Mulligan had said he was high on bath . salts and marijuana, but the banker's lawyer denied this. However, . it has now emerged that on May 13 he told a Glendale police officer he . had been taking 'white lightning' - another name for bath salts, which . are a form of synthetic methamphetamine. Lawsuit: The bank magnate is suiting the LAPD for $50million after the altercation left him with nasal fractures and other injuries . The . officer made a recording of the 10-minute encounter, which started when . Mulligan approached the police saying: 'I know this is gonna sound . crazy, but I feel like there are people following me - I feel like there . was a chopper, do you hear a chopper?' When . the policeman assured him that he was not being followed, Mulligan . described himself as 'a little paranoid', adding: 'I could be nuts.' The . officer asked him if he was on medication, and Mulligan replied: 'My . lawyer will kill me if I say this, but I went to a head shop and I . bought some of that white lightning stuff... I don't know what it is, . but it was bad.' Altercation: Vice chairman of Deutsche Bank Brian Mulligan got into an alleged altercation with the LAPD last May . As the policeman warned him about the dangers of the fashionable drug, the banker said, 'I've probably used it 20 times.' The officer continued his caution and concluded: 'It will continue to become worse if you don't stop.'Mulligan . said that he had last taken the drug two weeks previously, though he . appeared to accept that he was still suffering from its effects. The . tape has been turned over to the LAPD, who have said that based on . audio analysis and the recollection of the officer involved, they are . satisfied that the man on the recording was indeed Mulligan. According to an initial police . report, Mulligan appeared 'out of it' after officers responded to 911 . calls about a man trying to break into people's cars at a drive-thru in . Highland Park. Mulligan seemed to be 'under the influence based on his behavior', Lieutenant Andrew Neiman told MailOnline. Officers said they were told by Mulligan he was high on marijuana, had ingested ‘white lightning,’ and had not slept for four days. The bank executive was spotted wandering in a confused state by passers-by at around 10.40pm on May 15. Due to his erratic behavior, officers called a senior officer to the scene, who carried out a drug evaluation. Mulligan told officers he was 'tired and exhausted' and asked to be escorted to his car so he could collect his belongings to go to the local Highland Park Motel. When they reached the vehicle, there was a large amount of money in the car, causing officers to call for back-up. Mulligan was then left at the motel by officers without further incident. He said, she said: Police officers said they found Mulligan walking near this Los Angeles-area Jack-in-the-Box . At around 1am that night, the same officers who dropped Mulligan off at the motel responded to reports of a man trying to get into vehicles. They saw Mulligan . in the street, running into oncoming traffic. Officers called him . back on to the sidewalk, but rather than comply, Mulligan assumed a . ‘combative stance’, striking martial arts poses. At that point, officers claimed they . were forced to subdue Mulligan, adding that a ‘use of force then . occurred' before he was arrested. The businessman's injuries required him to be admitted to hospital for facial lacerations and as many as 15 nasal fractures. In August this year, Mulligan sued the LAPD for $50million, saying that he was battered by the police during the encounter. According to court documents, the Deutsche . Bank executive further alleged that the LAPD officers in question were . holding him hostage at the motel where he was staying as a means to . steal the $5,000 he had on his person at the time. Held hostage? Police say that he requested to be taken to the Highland Park Motel to rest, but his lawyer claims he was held hostage there . Mulligan’s . lawyer Michael Flanagan said in his claim that the officers stopped him . on a sidewalk in Los Angeles and discovered $5,000 cash in his car. At that point, Mr Flanagan said that his client was driven to a hotel and told he would be killed if he attempted to leave. He was also told that he would not be allowed to call his wife Victoria, to let her and their children know where he was. When, after a few hours, Mulligan did try to leave, Mr Flanagan said that police found him and beat him mercilessly. 'At that point, he was in such great fear that he believed the LAPD officer were not truly LAPD officers but may be impostors bent on robbing or killing,' the suit reads. Mulligan was booked for resisting arrest as well as interfering with law enforcement. The Deutsche executive suffered facial lacerations and as many as 15 nasal fractures, which will require extensive reconstructive surgery. His attorneys estimate that the incident has caused him the loss of $500,000 already and in the coming years, amount to a loss of $5million. Mulligan, a graduate of the . University of Southern California, has worked at numerous high-profile . firms, including Fox, NewsCorp, and Universal Studios. Premiere Magazine voted him as one of the '50 most powerful people in Hollywood' and the Los Angeles Business Journal voted him 'One of the 10 most prominent bankers in Hollywood'. From . 2003 to 2008, he served on the board of Napster as the Director, . Chairman of Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee and a Member . of Executive Committee.

The name Vera refers to his wife, Vera Grubb, whom he had married just eight months earlier. And today a wedding picture of the couple was released by relatives for the first time. Born in Derby, Flight Lieutenant . Chambers had an extraordinary career. He had flown 58 operational . sorties and had won a Distinguished Flying Cross and Bar before his . death at 23. His brother John, of Sunderland, has been searching for years to find out what happened to his sibling and was overcome when the discovery was made. The 76-year-old former mechanical engineer, who was just eight when his brother died, said: 'I had a day of sadness. 'I have personally been looking for the plane for four or five years. I remember a lot about him. 'Nine months after the flight he was registered as missing, presumed dead. Before that we kept hope that he was a prisoner of war, that somehow he had got out of the plane.' Despite his young age, he remembers Vera's reaction to the gut-wrenching news. He said: 'She was obviously grief-stricken. 'The whole family was, particularly my mum and dad. I remember being told at school to go home with my brother Tony and when I got home my parents were sobbing their eyes out. 'It was a tragic event.' John is now writing a book about his brother's exploits and hopes to visit the site of the crash soon. Chambers was 97 Squadron’s signals leader and was wireless operator and air gunner on the D-Day flight.

"By . Anthony Bond . UPDATED: . 15:29 EST, 17 February 2012 . He is currently battling to win over a sceptical British public, not yet convinced of his ability to lead the nation. But when Labour leader Ed Miliband met a 16-month-old baby today during a routine hospital visit, he would have expected to meet little resistance. Unfortunately for the beleaguered Leader of the Opposition, things didn't go quite to plan. Meet and greet: Ed Miliband was introduced to Carla Toner, left, and her 16-month-old son Marley Richardson during his visit to the Royal Bolton Hospital today . Not happy: Despite the Labour leader looking thrilled to receive Marley, left, the tot soon begins to look uncomfortable and bursts into tears, right . Mr Miliband was being shown around the Royal Bolton's Hospital's . children's ward. He was soon introduced to Carla Toner and her . 16-month-old son Marley Richardson in the ward playroom, where the . youngster was recovering from tonsillitis. But, despite being many years away from being able to cast his first vote, the youngster quickly made his feelings known. As soon as he was handed over to Mr Miliband, the poorly baby burst into tears and writhed around in discomfort. Despite trying his hardest to win over the tot, Mr Miliband was left with no choice but to hand him back over to his mother. Time for mum: Mr Miliband is left with no option but to hand Marley back to Carla Toner, after the baby started crying . Following his little set-back with Marley, Mr Miliband soon got back onto comfortable ground, by attacking Prime Minister David Cameron. During his visit, the Labour leader said the NHS would become the 'defining issue' at the next election. He said Mr Cameron had broken 'solemn . promises' at the last election to protect the NHS. Mr Miliband told hospital staff: 'David Cameron hid his plans for the NHS from the British public at the last general election. 'Now we know they will divert . billions of pounds from patient care to bureaucracy and lead to a . creeping privatisation of the NHS. 'People didn't get a chance to vote for these plans at the last election. 'I'm determined to make it the defining issue at the next general election if David Cameron does not drop this Bill. 'These are his plans and he will be judged on them. 'These plans won't help to reform the NHS, they will damage the NHS.' Mr Miliband said the British NHS was . the 'envy of the world' but the Prime Minister had not been 'straight' with the public over his plans. He added: 'If he doesn't drop the . Bill, I will make it a defining issue in the next general election . because I think these plans are dangerous. 'We are going to take this fight right up to the next election.' It was also claimed today that MPs may not debate the Government's controversial health reforms on the floor of the Commons despite an e-petition calling for them to be scrapped reaching 140,000 signatures. Under the Government's scheme, many . signatories hope that by putting their name to an e-petition they can . force MPs to debate the issue in the House of Commons. But . Labour MP Natascha Engel, chairwoman of the Backbench Business . Committee, said the amount of time allocated by the Government meant it . was increasingly difficult to schedule debates on contentious issues . such as NHS reform. Concerned: Ed Miliband, right, and shadow health secretary Andy Burnham, left, meet Steven Lowe and his son Lincoln, 4, during the visit to the Royal Bolton Hospital . A number of rebel Liberal Democrats or dissenting Tory MPs would also have to back the Drop the Health Bill petition as her committee can only schedule debates with cross-party support, she said. Ms Engel said she had 'big concerns' there would not be enough time to schedule a debate in the Commons. She said: 'We have loads of different debates waiting for allocation. The Migration Watch debate still hasn't been scheduled. 'It's such a contentious issue and it's against the Government's position and it's the Government that allocates us time, so there is definitely a conflict of interests.' Accusations: During his visit today, Ed Miliband said Mr Cameron, pictured, had broken 'solemn promises' at the last election to protect the NHS . The Government's website states any petition reaching 100,000 signatures 'could be debated' in the House of Commons, but this is not guaranteed. The Procedure Committee has said all e-petitions reaching six figures will trigger a hearing at least in Westminster Hall, a much smaller annexe where MPs can hold debates which do not require a vote. The Bill has also attracted opposition from health professionals and patients' groups, while there have been reports of deep unease among Tory Cabinet ministers and even Number 10 insiders about the legislation. On Monday, Downing Street dismissed suggestions that its author, Andrew Lansley, should be sacked as Health Secretary and insisted ministers were 'fully behind' the reforms. Mr Cameron is expected shortly to launch a new offensive to 'sell' the Bill to the public, saying at the weekend that he was 'at one' with Mr Lansley. Today, Health minister Simon Burns hit back at Mr Miliband's claims the Tories had reneged on their pre-election promises. He said: 'Ed Miliband can talk the NHS down all he likes, but the truth is that services are getting better all the time - with shorter waits since the election, 820,000 more people able to access an NHS dentist, 15,000 fewer administrators, 4,000 more doctors and 600 more midwives. 'Our plans deliver control for patients, power for doctors and nurses, and less bureaucracy. Labour still have no plan to help our NHS meet the challenges of the future. Their approach is simply one of cynical opportunism.'",Labour leader uses visit to accuse Prime Minister of breaking 'solemn promises' at last election to protect the NHS .

"Some nurses do not understand basic phrases including 'nil by mouth' Strict EU laws mean nurses coming in from European countries cannot be tested on language skills . By . Sophie Borland And Rebecca Evans . UPDATED: . 20:09 EST, 9 September 2011 . Patients have told how they are being forced to use sign language because hospitals are employing foreign nurses who struggle to understand English. One nurse mistakenly handed out a trifle with nutty toppings to a patient with a nut allergy because they did not understand warnings in his medical notes. Some hospitals have resorted to sticking pictures of syringes, blankets and other medical equipment on the outside of cupboards – rather than having written lists – so all nurses know where to find everything. Frustrating: But a breakaway in communication can also be dangerous . Language barrier: Fertility expert Lord Winston has warned that nurses who cannot speak English pose a grave danger to patients (picture posed by model) The examples have come to light a day after the Daily Mail revealed the grave concerns of Lord Winston, who said the poor communication skills of some Eastern European nurses was putting patients in danger. The world-renowned fertility doctor expressed particular worries over nurses from Romania and Bulgaria who had been trained in a 'completely different way'. Clear communication: Lord Winston said nurses must be able to understand their patients . Nearly 3,000 nurses from EU countries registered with the Nursing and Midwifery Council last year, a rise of 38 per cent in just 12 months. They made up more than one in eight nurses who registered to work in Britain. But strict EU rules mean that the NMC is banned from carrying out any checks on their English or competence as this is deemed to restrict the 'free movement of labour'. Since the Mail's front page story yesterday, dozens of patients and NHS workers have got in touch to express their own concerns over nurses' inability to communicate with those in their care. One man who had recently been treated in a hospital in Manchester said he had resorted to using sign language. Another described how a foreign nurse mistakenly gave him a trifle with a nut-based topping – despite his wearing a medical bracelet stating he had a peanut allergy, a fact which was also outlined in his notes. Yesterday's Daily Mail . As a student nurse I must agree with Lord Winston. In one placement upon a neonatal unit over half the nursing staff were foreign and much of the time they only spoke their own language to one another. On one night shift I was the only English-speaker. The entire handover was done in their own language and my mentor would not communicate with me. This led to something happening to a patient that could have been avoided. Student Nurse, NHS . I heard a nurse trying to explain the difference between a 'milligram' and a 'microgram' to a doctor about to inject drugs. The difference of course is 'correct dosage' vs 'fatal overdose'. Tom, Dorset . I work as an administrator in the NHS and see examples of this every day. Many nurses cannot write English, and when they add their nursing notes, the errors are astounding. Ensure you have access to your medical notes and those of any relatives whose care you are overseeing in hospital. It really is the only way. Rosi, Croydon, Surrey . It is a disgrace and Lord Winston certainly knows what he is talking about. Medical staff who cannot speak English? It has been going on for years. I personally dread having to be admitted to an NHS hospital for this very reason. Audrey McLean, Tadworth, Surrey . In the medical profession people MUST be able to understand our language. Hiring people who can't understand is nothing short of neglect. Lindsay, Warrington . I have worked overseas in a Swiss hospital.

Good communication between patient and practitioner is vital, not only for reassurance but also to ensure proper treatment is received.

A nursery worker has been sentenced to 12 months in prison after using hidden cameras to spy on children at an after school club. James Hoffman, 34, a self-confessed loner is suspected to have Aspergers syndrome. He made the recordings over eight years, Croydon Crown Court heard. Hoffman used used a camera concealed 'on his person' to film children between the ages of five and 11 at an after school club. Croydon Crown Court heard that nursery worker James Hoffman secretly filmed children between the ages of five and 11 . He also used a second hidden camera to film adult colleagues using the toilet at the nursery where he worked. Hoffman, of Purley, worked for the Jancett Nursery group across South London from the age of 18. He was arrested after a hidden camera was found by adults in a cubicle of the staff room toilets of a nursery in Sutton, Surrey. When Hoffman was asked by another member of staff why he had done it, he said it was because he was lonely and he had never had a girlfriend. A subsequent raid of his home found recordings dating back over many years. The films included at least 16 . secret recordings of people going to the toilet. There was also 25 minutes of footage of half-naked children playing in a garden was found which had been filmed over a fence. Ten indecent images of children were found on Hoffman’s laptop in the police raid. They included an image at level five, which are classified as the most extreme images of child pornography. Hoffman pleaded guilty to eight charges of voyeurism, and four of possession of indecent images of a child, on August 22. Sentencing, Hoffman to 12 months in prison, Judge Daniel Flahive said: 'This is a very serious offence as you were in a trusted position. You are anxious in the company of adults and unable to interact socially. I have read the psychiatric reports and it appears very likely you suffer from Aspergers, which goes some way to explain your behaviour. However, an immediate custodial sentence is necessary due to the invasion of privacy and your abuse of trust.' Hoffman will also be put on the sex offenders register for 10 years. He could be out of prison in six weeks because of time served on remand.","James Hoffman, 34, used hidden camera to film children at an after school club .

"By . Rob Cooper . UPDATED: . 15:03 EST, 17 February 2012 . Jailed: Drugs baron Dennis Kelly who hid in the Costa Del Sol for five years before he was discovered . A drugs baron who plotted to flood Britain with £166m of 'staggeringly high purity' cocaine has been told he is likely to die in jail. Convicted murderer Dennis Kelly, 62, planned to import 1.6tonnes of coke hidden in tins of asparagus. When the plot was uncovered by police in 2005 he went on the run for five years hiding in the Costa Del Sol. The drugs - which were around 92 per . cent pure - had a street value of £83million but their value could have doubled if . they were diluted with other chemicals. The Class A cargo had been shipped from Peru to Rotterdam before being moved to Amsterdam. However, police intercepted the haul before it was sent to Liverpool. The drugs baron ran the Merseyside end of the operation along with his son James as part of a 'family affair'. He has been given 27 years behind bars. Kelly and his gang were expecting to take a quarter of the haul themselves. When police uncovered the plot in November 2005, Kelly fled and left his family to face justice. While his father was lying low as one of Merseyside’s most wanted criminals James Kelly pleaded guilty to his part in the operation and, in 2007, was jailed for 19 years. His sister Sarah got a suspended prison sentence for concealing £29,000 of his ill-gotten cash found in a rucksack at her home. But Dennis Kelly, also known as Dennis O’Brien, was tracked down in the Costa Del Sol resort of Calahonda and arrested in December 2010. Upon his return to Britain he was immediately jailed for breaching the terms of his lifelong licence for the murder of Toxteth newsagent Billy Osu in 1983. Hideout: Calahonda, Costa del Sol where Dennis Kelly was hiding until 2010 when he was brought back to Britain . At the beginning of his trial last month prosecutor Anne Whyte QC, told jurors: 'He had the wherewithal, the guile and the means to support himself for the five years before his apprehension. 'That took precedence over the on-going prosecution against members of his own family. 'By the end of this trial you will be sure what motivated him [to stay away] - greed, criminality, the profits and the desire not to be caught.' His trial for conspiracy to import Class A drugs lasted for six weeks and saw dozens of witnesses called. But the jury of seven women and five men took just over seven hours to find him guilty. Marguerite Russell, defending, pointed out that at least Kelly had not given evidence and therefore not lied on oath. She made a plea for clemency, saying: 'Please offer a little glimmer of hope for someone of his age otherwise it will mean a sentence of life - complete life.' Judge John Roberts said: 'You kept, to quote the prosecution’s words, ""under the radar"" as the planner and director of operations. 'You commissioned the drug from the source while your son James travelled extensively in Europe. 'You and he had, in reality, a working partnership of equals. I am satisfied you were both right at the top of the UK supply chain. 'You were also prepared to lend money to others to allow them to participate in the wicked trade of drug supply. 'What was contained in those tins of asparagus was cocaine of a staggeringly high purity. 'This case is so serious that only a very long sentence of imprisonment can be imposed given the nature of the offence and the breathtaking scale of it.' He said Kelly could be expected to serve half of whatever sentence he passed, though he warned Kelly, of Stanfordham Drive, Garston: 'Whether you will actually be released will depend on your status at that time so far as a life sentence for murder is concerned. 'The sentence I pass upon you is one of 27 years imprisonment. That sentence will begin immediately.'","Dennis Kelly, 62, hid in the Costa Del Sol for five years after the plot was discovered in 2005 .

A Scottish farmer was faced with the extraordinary sight of his carrots standing upright above the ground after a nearby river burst its banks and washed away the soil around them. Allan Fearn, 60, went out to check his fields at Redford Farm in Laurenkirk after the North Esk burst its banks, and was worried that his crops might have been badly damaged or washed away.

Germany's latest masterplan for saving the euro involves a huge transfer of power to Brussels by countries using the endangered currency. But Britain is seen as a major stumbling block for his plans as the divide between Britain and the continent becomes wider by the day. Finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble says he is 'determined' to end the euro crisis once and for all. The antidote - giving the EU far greater powers over the national budgets of individual states. Man with a plan: Germany's Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble (left) speaks with Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister Kittirat Na Ranong (right) in Bangkok yesterday. He has proposed giving the EU far greater powers over the national budgets of individual states . 'We now need to go a major step in the direction of a fiscal union that will go beyond the proposals made so far,' Mr Schaeuble said on Monday night during a flight back to Berlin from a tour of Asia. Mr Schaeuble said he wants to concentrate on far-reaching reforms that include: . It is understood that Mr Schaeuble discussed his plans with European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, Euro Group President Jean-Claude Juncker, European Commission President José Manuel Barroso and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi before he went public with them and has received the green light. Mr Schaeuble's proposals look like being discussed at the EU summit in Brussels this Thursday and Friday. Enacting them will require changes to the EU treaties signed by member states. He wants to convene an EU convention by the end of the year in which EU members work on a draft that would then have to be ratified by the 27 member states. Observers say it would take at least 18 months, and probably longer, before they can be implemented. 'That, of course, assumes that Britain, . which is not a member of the euro zone and which often opposes steps . towards closer European integration, will play along,' said German . magazine Der Spiegel. Any resemblance? Angela Merkel this week compared David Cameron and the British to the irascible stars of The Muppet Show Waldorf and Statler . 'If it doesn't, it won't be possible to change the EU treaties. Eurozone governments would have to come up with a separate treaty as they recently did with the fiscal pact. 'The British should not underestimate Schaeuble's determination to solve the euro crisis. Chancellor Angela Merkel backs the proposals.' On Monday this week the same magazine said that Mrs Merkel is actively plotting for an EU without Britain in it and thinks David Cameron and the British are the Statler and Waldorf of Europe, it was claimed yesterday. The German chancellor apparently likens the Prime Minister to the grumpy Muppets who constantly grumble from the sidelines.","German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble 'determined' to end euro crisis .

"By . Kerry Mcdermott . PUBLISHED: . 03:30 EST, 15 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:08 EST, 15 October 2012 . A campaign aimed at preventing bullying in schools across the U.S. is being boycotted by a conservative Christian group that claims it promotes homosexuality among students. Mix It Up At Lunch Day, which sees schoolchildren encouraged to sit with fellow pupils they wouldn't normally spend time with, is designed to break up social cliques and stop students feeling isolated, organisers say. But the American Family Association, a conservative evangelical group, has branded the project a 'nationwide push to promote the homosexual lifestyle in public schools'. Mix It Up: Organisers of the event say it is designed to help break down social barriers and curb bullying in schools . Around 200 schools have cancelled plans to hold Mix It Up At Lunch Day on October 30 after the association e-mailed parents urging them to keep their children at home on the day of the event. Maureen Costello, from the Southern Poverty Law Center, which launched the programme 11 years ago, said the Christian group had lied to parents about the aims of the event and reverted to a 'cynical, fear-mongering tactic'. The Southern Poverty Law Center recently added the American Family Association - which describes itself as acting to 'restrain evil by exposing the works of darkness' - to its national list of active hate groups, which also includes neo-Nazis and Holocaust deniers. But Bryan Fischer, director of issue analysis for the association, said it was not a hate group but rather 'a truth group'. He said that, while Mix It Up Day does not specifically address homosexual students, the Law Center promotes equal treatment for gay and lesbian pupils and that philosophy informs the event. 'It's just another thinly veiled attempt to promote the homosexual agenda,' Mr Fischer told the New York Times. 'No one is in favour of anyone getting bullied for any reason, but these anti-bullying policies become a mechanism for punishing Christian students who believe that homosexual behaviour is not something that should be normalised.' 'Truth group': Bryan Fischer has accused organisers behind Mix It Up Day of trying to promote 'the homosexual agenda' Ms Costello, director of the Law Center's Teaching Tolerance project, told the newspaper Mix It Up Day was not about sexual orientation but rather about breaking up fixed social cliques, which can be especially evident in school cafeterias. She said pupils who are gay or perceived to be gay can often be on the receiving end of bullying at school, but insisted any suggestion the programme was intended as a means of homosexual indoctrination was totally wrong. 'We’ve become used to the idea of lunatic fringe attacks but this one was complete misrepresentation,' she said. Only one of around 200 schools that have cancelled planned Mix It Up Days agreed to comment. The Chattahoochee County Education Center in Cusseta, Georgia, said it decided to cancel because teachers were too busy trying to meet state teaching requirements, and not because it wanted to take a position on gay rights. 'Complete misrepresentation': The Southern Poverty Law Center said the Christian group had lied to parents about what Mix It Up Day stands for . The Avon Grove Charter School in rural Pennsylvania is still planning to hold Mix it Up At Lunch Day for its 1,600 students, despite complaints from parents. Headteacher Kevin Brady said the e-mail from the American Family Association described an event that bore 'absolutely no resemblance to what we do'. He said that once parents understood how the programme actually worked, they saw no reason not to allow their children to attend school. On Mix It Up At Lunch Day students are each assigned a number and then paired up by school officials to sit together at lunch time.","Mix It Up Day was launched as a means of breaking up cliques and preventing bullying at schools in the U.S.

Hollie is now 19 and a dairy farmer - and Little Puss has been piling on the pounds. Melanie Ashlin was over the moon to be reunited with missing cat Little Puss a decade after it vanished. But the food loving feline now weighs three times what he did when he left . Melanie said: 'His name’s a bit out of date now though - he's massive and perhaps we should start calling him Big Puss!' When Little Puss left he was a slimline 4lbs. Now he has tripled to a curvier 12lbs. 'He’s very fat and he doesn't stop eating,' Melanie said. 'I don't know whether someone has had him and has been looking after him. 'When he left he was only seven months old. I thought I would never see him again, so it is just amazing. 'It is lovely having him home. He is so sweet, he doesn't really want to go out, he's quite happy here.'

After almost a decade, he was found wandering forlornly and taken to a vet as a stray. There he was scanned and they found a microchip. That revealed his owners lived just a couple of miles from the spot he was picked up. Melanie was stunned when she received a call to say they had found her wandering feline. 'I was so shocked - even after ten years,' the mum-of-two said. 'I had never stopped thinking about him and wondering what had happened to him. 'When I went to pick him up I thought he would be a bit feral but although he was obviously a bit scared, he was as good as gold.

They took him to a vet in nearby Merstham who scanned him. Two weeks after he was found he has settled back in with his family. But he has had to adjust to having company.

Today's meeting approved 'additional restrictive measures in the financial, trade, energy and transport sectors' against Iran as well as imposing asset freezes and trade restrictions on more companies, notably those 'active in the oil and gas industry.' German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said the ministers had also banned the import of Iranian natural gas into EU nations. Meanwhile a leading European satellite provider took 19 Iranian television and radio broadcasters off the air, a result of earlier sanctions which prompted accusations of censorship and threats to sue from Iranian state television. The EU ministers also agreed to prohibit all transactions between EU and Iranian banks unless they were authorized in advance for humanitarian reasons. No transparency: Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is still refusing to come clean about the country's nuclear programme insisting it is intended for peaceful purposes . Financial restrictions: The EU's foreign ministers hope that the new sanctions against Iranian trade and freezing of assets will hit the Islamic nation's treasury . They also tightened restrictions on the Central Bank of Iran and imposed more export restrictions ‘notably for graphite, metals, software for industrial purposes, as well as measures related to the shipbuilding industry.’ Maryam Rajavi, president-elect of the Iranian Resistance, an organisation seeking to oust Ahmadinejad’s regime, welcomed the decision to expand sanctions. She called the move ‘an essential step to preclude this regime from acquiring nuclear weapons,’ and asked the EU to sever all economic and commercial ties with Iran. On his way into Monday's meeting, British Foreign Secretary William Hague said new sanctions would be ‘a sign of our resolve in the European Union that we will step up the pressure.’ Hague said such pressure would . continue to mount ‘over the coming months unless negotiations succeed. We remain open of course to success of negotiations.’ Many . countries fear that Iran is working to develop nuclear weapons but . Iranian officials say the country's nuclear program is intended solely . for peaceful purposes. Suspected site: Lavizan Shiyan, a restricted area next to a military complex in a Tehran suburb, was thought to be a possible location for weapons of mass destruction . Possible base: An alleged facility in Natanaz, Iran which the regime also claims is completely harmless . The European broadcast satellite cutoff means state broadcaster Irib’s television channels are no longer broadcasted in Europe and elsewhere. Satellite provider Eutelsat agreed with media services company Arqiva to block Irib's nine TV channels and ten radio stations as of Monday morning because of ‘reinforced EU council sanctions,’ Eutelsat spokeswoman Vanessa O'Connor said. Irib was targeted in a round of EU sanctions against Iran adopted in March after European officials said its broadcasts violated human rights. Iran's state-run Press TV said Irib could take legal action against Eutelsat over the cutoff ‘to compensate for any material and spiritual damages.’ Press TV says it was among the channels cut by the Eutelsat decision. Others include Farsi-language channels for Iranian expatriates and Arabic-language offerings, including the news channel Al-Alam. In a statement, Press TV said the move ‘shows that the European Union does not respect freedom of speech and is a step to mute all alternative news outlets representing the voice of the voiceless.’","Raised fear Iran is developing nuclear weapons as it refuses to come clear about its programme .

There appeared to be little chance of escape for this pelican when the jaws of a huge humpback whale opened up beneath it. But after disappearing into the huge mouth of the whale, these pictures show the incredible moment  the bird re-emerged, then made its bid for freedom. The pelican spent a few desperate moments flapping its wings before taking flight off into the air as the whale's jaws closed shut. The game is up: A pelican found itself trapped in the jaws of a huge humpack whale after diving for fish in Port San Luis Harbour, in Avila Beach, California . Collision course: It appears the pelican and the whale had both aimed for the same pool of fish when they collided . It seems the bird had tried to dive for the same group of fish as the whale in Port San Luis Harbor, Avila Beach, California, and ended up stuck in the humpback's jaws. But it appears the Humpback whale, which tends to feed on krill and fish, had no interest in eating a feathery alternative and, instead of descending to the watery depths which would have crushed the pelican to death, decided to open up its jaws to let it go. This amazing sequence of pictures were taken by amateur photographer Rob Bishop who lives near the harbour. He said: 'There have been an unusually large number of small fish in the harbour this year. 'Huge amount of brown pelicans have arrived and are diving for the fish. They have been followed by humpback whales coming into the harbour to feed on the fish. Lethal: If the humpback whale went under the water with the pelican still trapped in its jaws, the bird would almost certainly have died . Miracle escape: The bird frantically flaps its wings to escape the jaws of the humpback . 'Whales come up from below the surface with their mouths open and then close them before going back under the surface. 'In this case the pelican was diving down while the whale came up, causing the unlucky pelican to get caught in the whales mouth. 'It appeared the whale opened his mouth back up to safely let the pelican back out.' Mr Bishop revealed he managed to secure this incredibly close-up images because the whale had ventured unusually close to the harbour walls. He added: 'At the time I took the pictures I was standing on the Port San Luis pier along with around to 100 other people. Freedom: The pelican finally frees itself from the whale's mouth in Port San Luis Harbor . Big friendly whale: Photographer Rob Bishop said the whale appeared to open its mouth wider to let the bird out before going back under the water . 'The whales had been coming up farther out in the harbour, but suddenly this one came up fairly close to where we were standing. Maybe 75 to 100 feet away. 'It is very rare for them to come in this close to where people and boats are. It was amazing because there were so many pelicans flying overhead and diving into the water, a lot of seals also swimming around, and then the whales suddenly coming up so close to us. 'The sounds of all this along with the ooohs and aaahs of the crowd was very surreal.' The humpback whale - also known as a Megaptera novaeangliae - is a species of baleen whale and adults range in length from 12 to 16 metres and weigh approximately 36,000 kilograms. Humpback whales typically migrate up to 16,000 miles each year and only eat in summer while fasting during the winter.","Unlucky pelican was diving for fish when it collided with the humpback whale .

Young people do not want to work or find themselves a job, according to the management at one of the UK's largest care home groups. Barchester Healthcare, which employs 15,000 staff across 200 care homes across the UK, has failed to fill nearly 1,000 vacancies this year despite high youth unemployment. The group has 600 paid youth apprenticeship places but has only managed to get 100 under-25s onto the scheme. The placements last up to six weeks with a strong chance of a paid job at the end of the scheme – but many recruits don't even bother turning up. Scroll down for video . Uninterested: Barchester Healthcare claims many young people only joined the apprenticeship scheme so they could keep their benefits . Terry Tucker, director of learning at the group, told The Sunday Telegraph: 'We've had so much bad luck. Some young people just don't seem keen on work. Many are not turning up or turning up late, some are swearing, they're just not interested. Jobcentre Plus is really embarrassed, they've rung us apologising. 'The ones that do turn up have been sent by the job centre and are just going through the motions or they won't get their benefits.' She added: 'It is very frustrating to have apprenticeships available and not have them filled, particularly given the numbers out of work around the country.' The company has also only managed to fill a fraction of nearly 1000 general vacancies it has available. Failing: The company claims many are leaving school completely unprepared for the working world . The company human resources director, Jeremy Colman, said many young people just don't have the motivation for work as the latest figures reveal that there are 1.2million people aged between 16 and 24 who are out of work. And the number of under 25s out of work for at least two years has more than doubled in the last four years. Mr Colman told The Times: 'We have seen numerous examples of young people not able to arrive on time, having no questions to ask what the job entails or what the company does, or simply having no confidence and are unable to even make eye contact. 'It breaks my heart to say it, but schools simply have not prepared them for the world of work.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 10:41 EST, 21 October 2011 . A pair of drunken teenage girls stabbed a man to death with a kitchen knife outside his home over a row which had nothing to do with him. Christopher Chapman, 24, died from a single stab wound through his liver and stomach after being knifed by Natasha Jade Johnson outside his flat in Blyth, Northumberland. Johnson and her accomplice Megan Hope were both drunk on vodka, wine and whisky when they started abusing Chapman outside his ground floor home in April. Jailed: Natasha Johnson, 17, left, delivered the stab wound to Mr Chapman while her accomplice Megan Hope, 19, right, was also armed with a kitchen knife . As well as being intoxicated, Johnson had broken a night curfew imposed on her just three days earlier when she knifed Chapman outside his home. The teenage pair had become involved in late night row with a group of Chapman's friends and had threatened to 'come and smash their faces in' shortly before the horrific stabbing. And when Chapman himself went outside to confront the two girls after telling them to 'go away', Johnson, 17, plunged the 15cm blade into his chest. Chapman collapsed by a nearby tree close to Hope, 19, who had also armed herself with a kitchen knife. Johnson, of Blyth, Northumberland, and Hope, of Ashington, Northumberland, are now facing life behind bars after Johnson, then 16, brutally killed Chapman in the early hours of April 19. The pair were today jailed indefinitely after being convicted of murder by a jury at Newcastle Crown Court. Hope, who went to the scene with Johnson, was also convicted of murder at Newcastle Crown Court, although she did not deliver the fatal blow herself. Stabbed: Chris Chapman, 24, pictured with former partner Tonya Rutherford, was knifed to death despite not being involved in the argument with Natasha Johnson . Johnson, who can now be named after reporting restrictions were lifted, and Hope wept in the dock as the jury foreman relayed the guilty verdict for murder to both teenagers. Friends and family of the 24-year-old Mr Chapman hugged each other with joy on hearing the verdict. Tonya Rutherford, 24, Mr Chapman's partner of two years, said: 'I loved everything about him, he was such a kind and genuine lad. 'He had a lot of friends and everyone had a lot of time for him. 'I am pleased that they got done for murder but nothing is ever going to be good enough. 'The pathetic two excuses for life will never make up for Chappy's one life. I had been with him for two years but I had known him a lot longer.' The teenage pair were jailed indefinitely today, as it emerged that Johnson should have been at home under curfew when she fatally stabbed Chapman in the early hours of April 19. Johnson, who was 16 at the time of the killing, had been given a nighttime curfew by a youth court just three days earlier. Hope, who was 18 at the time, was under a supervision order, but also armed herself with a kitchen knife and was convicted of murder for 'encouraging' Johnson. Jailing Johnson for a minimum 15 years and Hope for 13 years, Judge James Goss told the pair: The circumstances of the violent and needless loss of Christopher Chapman's young life provide a stark example of the consequences of young, drunken people, out of control, arming themselves with knives and going out intent on fighting. Addressing Johnson, he added: 'Fighting at night with a knife in public places when intoxicacted naturally causes and in this case caused considerable public disquiet. Johnson had claimed during the murder trial at Newcastle Crown Court that Chapman 'ran into the knife' 'At the scene you clearly took the leading and most aggressive role and ignored repeated requests to go away. 'You did not intend to kill, however, carrying and using a knife in a violent confrontation always carries the inherent risk of fatal injury being caused, as happened here.' On the night he was killed, Chapman had invited friends round for a drink and in the early hours, three of them left his flat to go to nearby Asda for more drinks. Around the same time Johnson spoke on the phone to one of Chapman's friends, Christopher Armstrong, while he was in the store. It is unclear what prompted the call, but the pair were mutually abusive and threatening. During the call Hope is said to have joined in the abuse while Mr Armstrong's friend joined in on his behalf. Johnson threatened to 'come and smash their faces in' and threats and abuse were passing in both directions. The girls, drunk on whisky, vodka and . wine armed themselves with a kitchen knife each and set off from . Johnson's home shortly before 3am. They . turned up at the victim's home and appeared outside Mr Chapman's . ground-floor flat and started shouting for those inside to come out. Johnson reached through an open window and grabbed a woman who was inside and started calling her names. Mr Chapman, who had not been involved . in the earlier row, shouted out of his window for them to go away, . while another one of his friends went to confront them. In response Johnson then produced her knife and, as she did so, Mr Chapman came out of the flats, behind the girl. She turned to him and stuck the 15cm . knife in the chest.  Chapman immediately walked to where Hope was . standing, near a tree, where he collapsed. He was taken to hospital by ambulance, but was pronounced dead on arrival. Chapman died of a single stab wound which went through his diaphragm and through his liver, stomach and aorta. Johnson had claimed the stabbing was an accident and said that Mr Chapman 'ran in to the knife' she was holding. Both teenagers went back to the younger girl's home afterwards and put their clothes in the washing machine.","Teenage pair were drunk on vodka, wine and whisky .

Solved: The 'man with no name' has been identified as Michael Sutherland, 34, of Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire . The mystery of a 'man with no name' whose body washed up on an isolated beach almost 25 years ago has at last been solved thanks to advances in forensic science. When a six-month police investigation failed to establish the identity of a body that washed ashore on a north Norfolk beach in 1989, saddened villagers held a poignant funeral service at a local churchyard. Now, almost a quarter of a century later, police have used DNA evidence to identify the mystery man as Michael Sutherland, 34, of Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire. Mr Sutherland's body was discovered by fishermen on Weybourne beach on October 9th, 1989. The remarkable breakthrough came after detectives from Norfolk and Suffolk's major investigation team took a fresh look at the region's missing persons cases. The team carried out an exhumation to obtain DNA from Mr Sutherland's teeth, which was then cross-checked against the missing persons database. Detective Chief Inspector Andy Guy, who said it was rare to solve investigations dating back as far as this one, said: 'On April 19th last year an exhumation was carried out to obtain DNA from Mr Sutherland's body,' he said. 'From the teeth I got a DNA profile and put this on the missing person database and found a match.' The detective contacted Mr Sutherland's sister, 67-year-old Ann Stockton, of Cleethorpes, to give her the news and finally offer the family some closure. The painstaking process of re-examining the old cases, some of which go back as far as the early 1960s, is part of a bid to help families desperately hoping to be reunited with their loved ones or at least to find answers regarding their fate, the detective explained. Desolate: Mr Sutherland's body washed ashore at Weybourne beach in north Norfolk in 1989 . Saddened villagers organised a poignant burial at a nearby churchyard back in 1990, where a photo of Mr Sutherland has now been placed on the grave . DCI Guy said unidentified bodies recovered in Norfolk and Suffolk, such as Mr Sutherland’s, were also part of their investigations and the team used a national missing person database to help crack these cases. 'The person is added to the list and is shown as missing. Then we also have a list of human remains. But in this case the home force - the local force - had captured DNA from Mr Sutherland’s family and put it on the database.' He explained that DNA was usually taken from the missing person but if police were unable to collect any then a virtual profile was made up using family members, such as the mother, father, siblings or children. It would not have been standard practice to collect DNA before 1995. Now Mrs Stockton and other members of her brother’s family will be making the 118-mile journey to Norfolk to put him to rest after organising a dedication service at Weybourne’s All Saints Church, where Mrs Stockton will read a eulogy. Mrs Stockton has said anyone that attended the original service in 1990 was welcome at the dedication for her brother. The service will be held on November 1st at 10.30am. Mr Sutherland's family will travel from Cleethorpes to hold a dedication service at Weybourne's All Saints Church next month .","The body that washed ashore on a north Norfolk beach in 1989 has now been identified as Michael Sutherland, 34, of Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire .

Rice said that rate was even higher than before the monitors arrived and a clear indication the Syrian government was stepping up the violence. Also Wednesday, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported fresh violence in Syria. The group said soldiers and army defectors were fighting Wednesday in central Hama province. There was no immediate word on casualties. The group also said regime forces fired on students demonstrating in Daraya in Damascus province. The Arab League mission came under . fresh scrutiny Wednesday after a former monitor said he quit in disgust . because the regime was committing 'war crimes' against its own people. 'The . mission was a farce and the observers have been fooled,' Anwer Malek . told Al-Jazeera in an interviewed broadcast late Tuesday. 'The regime . orchestrated it and fabricated most of what we saw to stop the Arab . League from taking action against the regime,' Malek said, still wearing . the orange vest used by monitors. According . to Al-Jazeera's transcript of the interview, Malek said the regime is . committing 'a series of crimes against its people.' 'The . regime didn't meet any of our requests, in fact they were trying to . deceive us and steer us away from what was really happening toward . insignificant things,' he said in the interview. 'They didn't withdraw . their tanks from the streets they just hid them and redeployed them . after we left.' North: A handout photo released by the official Syrian News Agency . shows a pro-regime rally in Lattakia province, northern Syria . South: Another official handout photo shows a pro-regime rally in El Souweida province, southern Syria . There was no immediate comment from . the Arab League. But Malek's name was on a list of the observers who . were sent to Syria last month. He was identified as a Tunisian working . for the Paris-based Arab Committee for Human Rights. According . to an Arab League official, three observers declined to complete their . mission and returned, citing health problems. The official, who spoke on . condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the . media, didn't identify the three. Rare appearance: President Assad gave his first speech since June yesterday . and said he would strike back at those who threaten his regime with an . 'iron hand' Opposition groups have been deeply critical of the Arab League mission, saying it is giving Assad cover for his ongoing crackdown. The observer mission's Sudanese chief has raised particular concern because he served in key security positions under Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, who is wanted for crimes against humanity in Darfur. Critics also say the mission is far too small - and too dependent on government escorts - to be effective. The regime says the escorts are vital to the monitors' personal safety. On Wednesday, the United States announce dit is cutting back on staff at its embassy in Syria because of security worries. The State Department says it has ordered a number of embassy employees to leave as soon as possible. It also reminded Americans to avoid traveling to Syria. The travel warning was issued as Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton criticized Syrian President Bashar Assad for - as she put it - 'only making excuses' about the continued violence. The U.N. says at least 5,000 have been killed in 10 months of unrest. The Damascus embassy's consular section will no longer offer public hours, with services by appointment only. The travel warned that the embassy's ability to help Americans in the event of an emergency was now 'extremely limited'.","U.S pulls number of embassy workers out of country .

Parents of a woman brutally murdered were horrified when police handed back their daughter’s jewellery still specked with her blood. Christine Chambers, 38, died at the hands of her jealous and violent ex-partner David Oakes when he shot her and her two-year-old daughter Shania at their home in Braintree, Essex in June last year. Ms Chambers’ family were returned a selection of jewellery belonging to Ms Chambers and Shania but police failed to remove all traces of blood left over from the murder. Bloodied jewellery: The family of Christine Chambers and her daughter Shania, 2, were horrified when police returned their jewellery with traces of blood still on them after they were brutally murdered . Oakes, of Steeple, near Maldon, was given two whole-life jail terms after being found guilty of the murders in May this year. Her sister, Jeannette Chambers, slammed the police for their insensitivity following the family’s horrific ordeal. She said: ‘My mum and dad have been through enough. ‘They shouldn’t have had to see my sister and niece’s blood on the jewellery returned to them. ‘I don’t think the police have any understanding what a person goes through. Family's grief: Sister Jeannette Chambers criticised police for their insensitivity following the family's ordeal as they grieve the pair (family members carrying their coffins from their funeral) Grieving: Ms Chambers' parents Ken and Jean (pictured during the trial) 'have gone through enough,' Jeanette Chambers said. Jean had to clean the blood off the jewellery herself . ‘They should have made sure the jewellery was inspected. My mum had to clean it all herself, then I looked at it last week and there was still blood on it. ‘One earring was dented - the way it was bent you just saw how violent he (Oakes) was towards Christine and how heavy the blows were. ‘It is lovely seeing stuff we have not seen, but we are never going to have her back in our lives again.’ Items returned included two rings, bracelets, necklaces and Shania’s earrings and were handed back in the past few weeks. Essex Police apologised today for the major blunder. Jealous, violent ex-partner: David Oakes (right) shot Ms Chambers and Shania at their home in Braintree, Essex before he shot himself but survived (left) Blunder: Essex Police had been criticised over the case for their handling of harassment reports toward Ms Chambers by Oakes leading up to the attack in which police tried to negotiate with Oakes while he had Ms Chambers and Shania inside the house . A police spokesman said every effort had been made to clean up the items but accepted mistakes had been made during the cleaning process. He said: ‘During a family liaison visit, after the return of the jewellery, Jeannette Chambers informed police she had found small traces of blood on one of the items returned. ‘Understandably, she found this discovery very distressing. ‘An immediate apology was provided to Ken and Jean. The apology was accepted and both Jean and Ken were understanding that the officer responsible for the cleaning of the jewellery had done his best. Murder weapon: The shotgun used by David Oakes to kill his former partner and her two-year-old daughter . ‘The delay in returning property was largely due to waiting to see if Oakes would be appealing against his conviction or sentence.’ This is the latest blunder by the force over the crime which was criticised earlier this year for the way it handled reports of harassment towards Ms Chambers in the lead up to her untimely death. An Independent Police Complaints Commission Report revealed the tragedy may have been avoided if action had been taken earlier to arrest the former nightclub bouncer. An investigation heard that Oakes . stormed Ms Chambers’ house and blasted her and their daughter Shania . with a shotgun just weeks after the family gained a restraining order . against him. Worried calls: Ms Chambers (pictured with Shania and her 10-year-old daughter) had made many calls to police in the lead up to the double-murder after her relationship with Oakes ended . 'Poorly resourced': Essex Police say they have improved its response to domestic abuse incidents after the deaths of Shania (pictured) and Ms Chambers . The damning report showed how Essex . Police officers failed to act despite a surge in the number of worried . phone calls from Ms Chambers in the two months leading up to the . horrific double killing after they were told her relationship with Oakes . had ended. Oakes was known to be ‘bullying and controlling’ yet ‘inadequate action’ was taken to arrest him at the earliest opportunity when he breached a non-molestation order. The report revealed there had been a catalogue of 16 incidents over two years involving Oakes and Ms Chambers yet they were treated ‘largely in isolation’. The investigation said police had failed to realise that Ms Chambers’ fear of Oakes was a potential motivation for her not pursuing complaints against him. And the IPCC also said Essex Police’s specialist domestic abuse investigation teams were ‘poorly resourced’ with a substantial backlog in inputting domestic violence forms on the force intelligence system. Essex Police says it has learnt from the tragic incident and has improved its response to domestic abuse incidents. At Oakes’ trial, the Chelmsford Crown Court heard that Oakes 'systematically tortured' Ms Chambers for several hours before the killings, forcing her to strip and cutting chunks from her hair. Ms Chambers' 10-year-old daughter fled the house during the ordeal as police outside attempted to negotiate with the killer. After shooting Ms Chambers and Shania he shot himself in the face, but survived.","Christine Chambers and daughter Shania, 2, were shot dead by her ex-partner David Oakes last year .

A Royal British Legion chief has quit his position after being caught boasting that he could abuse his position to help arms dealers win lucrative defence contracts. Lieutenant General Sir John Kiszely, the national president, fell on his sword after being embroiled in the ‘top brass for hire’ scandal. The retired officer bragged he could use his role at the charity to help defence companies lobby ministers and senior figures in the British military. Quitting: Royal British Legion chief Lieutenant General Sir John Kiszely (pictured in 1996 in Ramici, Bosnia and Herzegovina) fell on his sword after being embroiled in the 'top brass for hire' scandal . The shamed Falklands hero even described the Legion’s annual Remembrance events - which honour men and women killed and maimed serving the country - as a ‘tremendous networking opportunity’. Sir John’s remarks were filmed by reporters posing as representatives of a South Korean weapons manufacturer looking to recruit him to help sell unmanned drone aircraft to the UK Government. He resigned in disgrace yesterday after admitting that it would be ‘inappropriate’ to remain as the Legion’s president. In a letter to the national chairman John Farmer, the former head of the Defence Academy said he had made ‘exaggerated and foolish claims’ about his involvement in bidding for defence contracts. But he insisted he had kept his position with the Legion ‘entirely separate’ from his business interests. He denies breaking lobbying rules. Sir John, 64, was one of several retired military officers secretly filmed by the Sunday Times allegedly claiming they could influence decision-making over arms deals. He made his boasts after being offered £110,000 a year from journalists. Bragging: Sir John claimed he could use Remembrance Sunday to lobby Defence Secretary Philip Hammond . In the covert footage, Sir John is shown saying he could push the fake firm’s interests with the Prime Minister in a private box at the Festival of Remembrance next month at the Royal Albert Hall. He also claimed he could use Remembrance Sunday to lobby the Defence Secretary. ‘You are standing there waiting for the Queen with nothing else to talk about to Philip Hammond than whatever,’ he said. Boast: Sir John claimed he could get his friend Armed Forces Minister Andrew Robathan (pictured) to consider bids by defence companies selling weapons to the government . The general boasted his role at the respected services body gave him top-level access at ‘various extremely boring affairs’. He explained: ‘If I tried to book in to have a meeting on behalf of a company, I probably wouldn’t get past the door.’ Sir John claimed he could get his friend Armed Forces Minister Andrew Robathan to consider bids by defence companies selling weapons to the government. He said: ‘I would get into his office by saying, “As president of the British Legion, you know, it’s time”... and that’s when you sow the seed.’ This was denied by the Ministry of Defence. Sir John, who advises defence firm Babcock International, also boasted about lobbying for a £4.3million contract during the ‘purdah’ period when the MoD is banned from discussing bids. In his resignation letter, Sir John said he always kept his ‘role of national president completely separate from any business interests’. He added he had ‘never used any access gained as president to raise the subject of, or discuss, any business interests whatsoever, let alone to make representations on behalf of clients. ‘But I made exaggerated and foolish claims to the contrary, incompatible with my position.’ Due to step down in December, Sir John said it was ‘in the Legion’s best interests’ for him to quit immediately. Royal British Legion director general Chris Simpkins said Sir John remarks were ‘out of character’. Lobbying: In the covert footage, Sir John is shown saying he could push the fake firm's interests with the Prime Minister in a private box at the Festival of Remembrance next month at the Royal Albert Hall (pictured) But he added: ‘The Legion’s work, including Remembrance events, must be kept free of any suggestion that they could be used for commercial or political gain.

Mr Hammond has launched a review of rules governing access to ministers and serving officers and vowed to ‘shut down’ meetings that could be seen as inappropriate. He insisted no contracts had been awarded as a result of outside influence. He accused some former officers of ‘bigging up their capabilities’. The other retired officers who boasted of their influence were former MoD procurement chief Lt Gen Richard Applegate; Admiral Sir Trevor Soar, until this year commander-in-chief of the Royal Navy; ex-Army heads General Lord Dannatt and General Sir Mike Jackson; and former head of the Armed Forces Lord Stirrup.

"By . Charles Walford . UPDATED: . 04:04 EST, 8 February 2012 . The world's last surviving First World War veteran has died - marking the end of an era in British history. Florence Green, who joined the war effort in September 1918, when she was aged just 17, passed away in her sleep at a Norfolk care home just two weeks before her 111th birthday. The great-grandmother, who lived through all but 400 days of the 20th century,  signed up to the Women's Royal Air Force two months before the end of the First World War. She was the last surviving person to . have seen active service in the Great War following the death of British-born . sailor Claude Choules in Australia last year. Write caption here . Mrs Green, who was born in London, worked at Narborough Airfield and RAF Marham, Norfolk, as an Officer's Mess steward. Florence spent her war days working . 'all hours' serving officers their meals. And she would often . spend time wandering the base simply 'admiring the pilots', she admitted.. Before . her death she said: 'I enjoyed my time in the WRAF. There were plenty . of people at the airfields where I worked and they were all very good . company. 'I would work . every hour God sent but I had dozens of friends on the base and we had a . great deal of fun in our spare time. In many ways I had the time of my . life. 'I met dozens of pilots and would go on dates. I had the opportunity to go up in one of the planes but I was scared of flying. It was a lovely experience and I'm very proud.' In later life she lived with her daughter May, 90, in King's Lynn, Norfolk, but had moved into Briar House care home shortly before Christmas where she died on Saturday. Her proud family today paid tribute to the veteran, describing her as 'a great woman'. May said: 'She so nearly made it to her 111th birthday. It is very sad. We are grateful for all the nice tributes.' Florence Green (circled far right third row up) with the other women who served at Narborough Airfield, where she was a waitress in the officers' mess . Mrs Green lived with daughter May (right) before she moved into a care home. May described her mother as 'a great woman' Mrs Green's younger daughter June Evetts, from Oundle, Northamptonshire, 76, said: 'I'm very proud of her and she was very proud of the recognition she received.' Her amazing story came to light after Andrew Holmes, a British correspondent for the US-based Gerontology Research Group, traced her name using the National Archive. Mr Holmes tracks and validates the ages of people over 110 and also keeps track of British men and women who are older than 107. He was stunned to locate a service record on the National Archive for Florence Beatrice Patterson, Mrs Green's maiden name. Mr Holmes traced the records further and was surprised to find Florence had joined the WRAF in September 1918 - two months before the war ended on November 11, 1918. He said: 'It's a common misconception that a veteran must be someone who saw action or fighting in the trenches. 'A veteran is someone who served in one of the Armed forces, regardless of their role - a medic, an ambulance driver or a waitress - they all count. 'Obviously the last surviving veterans of any war are likely to be the youngest and therefore would not have served long.' He added: 'I am saddened by her death. Florence was the sixth oldest person in the UK and the only remaining . WW1 veteran in the world.' The original aim of the WRAF, which was set up as an auxiliary organisation of the Royal Air Force in 1918,  was to provide female mechanics to allow men to serve on the front line. However, the organisation saw huge enrollment, with women volunteering for positions as drivers and mechanics and filling other wartime needs. This first WRAF was disbanded in 1920. Heroes: British-born Claude Choules (left) was the last surviving First World War combat veteran before his death last year. Harry Patch (right), who was Britain's last survivor of the trenches, died in July 2009, aged 111 . Last May the only living male First . World War combat veteran, British-born sailor Claude Choules, died in . Australia at the age of 110. Britain's last survivor of the First World War trenches Harry Patch - known as 'The Last Tommy' - died in July 2009 aged 111. RAF . Squadron Leader Paula Willmot yesterday said RAF Marham, where Florence . was stationed for seven months, would pay its respects to the veteran . 'in true style'. She said: 'We will be supporting the family at the funeral. We are sending a number of our stewards as a tribute to her. 'We kept in contact with her and visited her just before Christmas to give her a Christmas cake, which she was delighted with. 'We were due to visit her on Friday to celebrate her 111th birthday. It is a very sad occasion, but what an amazing woman. 'She is very much a Norfolk lass. We have very good memories of her. RAF Marham will be paying its respects in true style.' RAF Marham in Norfolk, where Mrs Green was stationed, is still in use today as a base for fighter pilots . Florence celebrated her 110th birthday on February 19, last year with her daughter May, who was her full-time carer. She is also survived by her son Bob, 86, who lives in Edinburgh, and four grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. She was married to husband Walter, a railway porter in 1920, for 50 years until his death in 1970. Sian Taylor, deputy manager of Briar House care home in King's Lynn, Norfolk, said Mrs Green 'always had a smile on her face.' She said: 'Florence came to us on November 23 last year. She was a lovely, very well-mannered woman and she always had a smile on her face. 'She was immobile, but would talk about the old days to the carers and other residents who would visit her in her room. 'A carer took her some water at 5am on Saturday and sadly found she had died in her sleep.'",Florence Green signed up to the WRAF two months before the end of Great War .

Flamboyant property tycoons Robert and Vincent Tchenguiz could sue the Serious Fraud Office for £100million following the collapse of Britain’s biggest-ever fraud inquiry. The brothers – who were arrested as they prepared to stage a champagne party on their yacht in Cannes – were questioned as part of an investigation into the collapse of Icelandic bank Kaupthing. However, the inquiry quickly became bogged down in legal disputes which exposed procedural blunders by SFO officials. Playboy lifestyle: Property tycoon Vincent Tchenguiz (left) pictured with his sister Lisa and brother Robert . Yesterday, in a humiliating climbdown, the agency dropped its inquiry into Robert, 52, just four months after ending its case against his 55-year-old brother. Now Robert is threatening to  join Vincent, who has issued a £100million ‘letter before action’ over compensation. The claim would almost certainly break the agency, which faces questions over its future and ability to handle the most complex cases. The brothers – who are said to have had a combined wealth of £4billion before the 2008 banking crisis – are renowned for their  playboy lifestyle. As well as the £30million London mansions, and offices adorned with Damien Hirst sculptures, there were dates with beautiful models and a place at the table alongside the movers and shakers of society. They bought their first property – a £47,000 one-bedroom flat in  London’s Marble Arch in 1979 – after their father, the Shah of  Iran’s former jeweller, gave them £1million with which to go into business. Just six months later, they had sold it for £73,000. Before long, the brothers were major London landlords, renting out flats to students and tourists. Soon after, they founded their  company, Rotch. The pair have continued to live a jet-set lifestyle. In 2010, despite reports that he lost £1billion in just 24 hours in the collapse of the Icelandic banks, Robert had allegedly commissioned a 200ft yacht. Probe: The brothers - who were arrested as they prepared to stage a champagne party on their yacht in Cannes - were questioned as part of an investigation into the collapse of Icelandic bank Kaupthing . The tycoon – who it is claimed introduced Dodi Fayed to Princess Diana – also continued to live in a £30million five-storey house next to the Albert Hall. It was reported  last year that Vincent still manages a £10million yacht and has kept hold of his  car collection, which included a Lamborghini, two Rolls-Royces, two Bentleys and an Aston Martin. In a statement yesterday, SFO director David Green said he has discontinued the investigation because there is ‘insufficient evidence to justify its continuation’. The SFO moved in during a  probe into the collapse of Kaupthing, one of three Icelandic banks which failed in October 2008. The fraud inquiry was one of the biggest-ever seen in Britain, with a senior Tory donor, at least one multi-millionaire and a leading luxury property developer all being dragged into the net. They are now not under suspicion. At one point, investigators even considered sending undercover officers into the Mayfair nightclub Annabel’s  to gather evidence. The Iranian brothers, who once owned 1 per cent of all British residential property, were arrested in March last year after questions were raised over the circumstances in which they secured huge cash loans against their property portfolios while also being depositors. The close links between the bank and one of its major investors was key to a 2,300 page report ordered by the Icelandic parliament. High life: It was reported last year that Vincent still manages his £10million yacht, the Veni Vidi Vici . It identified Robert as the ‘largest debtor’ in Kaupthing as well as a shareholder in Exista, an investment company that was the biggest shareholder in Kaupthing. In July, the High Court set aside warrants against both Tchenguizes, after finding that they had been unlawfully obtained. A month later it ruled the agency had acted unlawfully and unfairly in its search of the Tchenguizes properties. In a damning verdict two judges questioned whether the SFO was adequately funded and accused it of being incompetent. Earlier this year it also emerged that the SFO had secretly offered to accept a £50million payment to charity from Robert in return for closing its investigation. The climbdown is another setback for the organisation following a series of high-profile failures. In 2006 the SFO caved into  pressure by halting the investigation of alleged corruption at BAE Systems. Its cases against employees of DIY chain Wickes and Durex maker SSL also collapsed. In a statement, Robert Tchenguiz said he ‘welcomed the decision by the SFO to clear him formally of any wrongdoing in the collapse of Kaupthing Bank’. He added: ‘I look forward to closing this chapter and getting on with business.’ An SFO spokesman insisted a closed case was not a failed case. He added: ‘It would be unrealistic to expect every investigation to lead to a prosecution.’","Robert and Vincent Tchenguiz could sue Serious Fraud Office for £100million .

'Pagan' worshippers gathered this year - as they do every year - at Salisbury Plain to mark the occasion. But those of us who missed it can explore Stonehenge in considerably more comfort - and detail - using a new iPhone and iPad app, the Stonehenge Experience. The app not only lets users explore Stonehenge in 3D, but also lets you 'rub' the screen to reveal different layers of prehistoric artefacts from the site - and recreates the sounds of when Stonehenge was constructed. The application offers virtual 3D 'tours' of the site - but also lets you 'dig through' layers of artefacts such as the gold breastplate found at the site . The application lets you explore around the site to give a sense of the prehistoric people that lived around it - with pictures and even sounds of the people who built Stonehenge . The site uses 3D digital 'models' so users can do things that visitors simply can't - such as excavating down through layers of the site to reveal artefacts such as a 'flesh hook' and a solid gold breast plate found at the site. All the 3D views of the site can be controlled via pinching and zooming on screen to let you 'walk' through Stonehenge - without the fences that usually keep visitors far from the stones. You can stand in the middle of the stones, and an 'acoustic model' also captures what it sounds like to stand there. Rupter Till of Huddersfield University - who 'modelled' the sounds of the app, said, . 'Creating the sound of Stonehenge as . it was when it was first built was a really interesting challenge. When . put together with the Ribui app it makes for an absorbing immersive . experience and allows people to see and hear Stonehenge as it was five . thousand years ago.' The app lets you explore 'back in time' and unearth finds such as the Amesbury Archer, a Bronze Age man whose remains were unearthed at the site in 2008 . The app also offers reconstructions of how the site was constructed, complete with sounds created by an acoustic engineeer . The app incorporates some of the latest archaeological findings, providing you with up to date explanations of the site’s purpose, based on  respected academic theory.

Britain’s top law officer yesterday paved the way for new inquests to be held into the 96 deaths at Hillsborough. Attorney General Dominic Grieve QC said he was taking the ‘exceptional’ step of applying to the High Court to have the original verdicts of accidental death quashed. His announcement came after a report into the 1989 disaster revealed last month that 41 fans could have been saved if the response of emergency services had been swifter. Ninety-six Liverpool fans died in the crush at the Hillsborough ground in Sheffield, but only this year has new evidence confirmed the need for fresh inquests . It also revealed a vast cover-up by . police and paramedics designed to blame Liverpool fans for the tragedy. Families of the victims hope new inquests will record verdicts of . corporate manslaughter. Mr Grieve said he was still . considering the new evidence, but would apply for fresh inquests to be . held on the basis of what he has already read. He said he was making the announcement early to ease the ‘anxiety’ of victims’ families. ‘My view is that I will apply to have . every one of those 96 inquests quashed,’ he told MPs. ‘I believe that . these deaths, arising as they do from a common chain of events, should . all be considered afresh.’ It was clear there were ‘significant . issues over the original inquest’, he added. But he admitted the new . legal process ‘will take some time’ and acknowledged that ‘the wait for . truth and justice has been long and unspeakably painful for a great many . people’. Attorney General Dominic Grieve said he would go to the High Court to quash the original 96 inquests into the deaths of the Liverpool fans killed in the Hillsborough tragedy . The report into the Hillsborough . disaster, headed by the Bishop of Liverpool, rejected the findings of . the original inquests that no lives could have been saved after 3.15pm . on the day. Pat Joynes, whose son Nicholas, 27, . was killed, said: ‘I’m highly delighted. We want the accidental death . verdicts quashed so we can get manslaughter verdicts. ‘I have spoken to different families . over the weekend. That seems to be the opinion and it is what I would . want as well – corporate manslaughter and manslaughter verdicts. ‘Ninety-six people can’t die and hundreds injured without someone being held responsible. ‘The truth, in my opinion, is finally . coming out, I’m very pleased. We want to see justice. If that means . police officers have to stand trial, well they should stand trial in a . criminal court.’ Mrs Joynes, who lives near St Helens, Merseyside, added that she hoped any new inquests would be held in Liverpool. Former Labour Justice Secretary Lord . Falconer, who has advised the victims’ families, said David Cameron had . made a ‘huge difference’ to the campaign. ‘You have a government, led by a . prime minister, saying, “This is a huge injustice, let’s sort it out” – . and that makes a real difference,’ he said.

Liverpool fans have spent 23 years campaigning for justice, including new inquests into the events of April 15 1989 . ‘The undeniable fact is that the . original inquest was unsound and this application, if successful, will . mean that evidence will be able to be heard after the 3.15pm cut off . imposed by the original coroner in the 1989 inquests,’ he added. ‘For the first time in over two . decades, all the evidence can now be reviewed into the disaster and . potentially a new verdict recorded on the death certificates of the . deceased. ‘At long last, the full horror of . Hillsborough will be on the public record alongside the names of the . people and the organisations that are accountable for what happened.’ He went on: ‘The families’ heartache . has been well documented but what is less well known is that some . families have refused to pick up the death certificates of their loved . ones who died on that day.’ Last month’s report concluded police . officers had tried to smear the dead by checking them for criminal . records and medics had tried to prove they were drunk.

A wallaby believed to be living wild in the British countryside is a domestic pet on the run after his owner tried to send him to Germany, it was claimed today. The marsupial, usually found in Australia, shocked local residents in Cambridgeshire when it was spotted hopping across the road and through woodland over the weekend. Experts claimed it was descended from a group that has lived in the wild for 60 years after escaping from a zoo but now it seems the rogue wallaby was acting alone. Wallaby on walkabout: First thought to be living wild in the British countryside when he was spotted by locals, it has been revealed that the marsupial is actually William's pet . Called Skippy, the wallaby hopped over a hedge in owner William Fernando’s garden a day before he was due to be flown to his new home on the continent. Seventeen-year-old William, who trades exotic animals, had spent the last week trying to catch the walkabout wallaby with no luck despite the sightings in his village of Barton. Police officers did catch the animal in the early hours of Sunday morning but were told by experts to let it go, believing it had probably spent all its life in the wild. Now William has teamed up with specialists from Shepreth Wildlife Park in a bid to recapture Skippy. 'No one would believe me': Skippy was spotted by a taxi full of passengers late on Friday night. Jessica Wiltshire took this picture which led experts to claim it was a descendant from a wild group who had lived in the countryside for 60 years . Hopped the hedge: Owner William has spent the last week trying to catch the wallaby but with no luck, 'he was much to quick for me,' he said . Freedom dash: William had only had Skippy for six weeks after acquiring him from a private collector in South Yorkshire. He kept him in the large enclosure pictured . He said: ‘Skippy was meant to be going to a new owner in Germany but he obviously got wind of the move and decided he’d prefer to stay in England. ‘I was cutting the grass last Friday with the lawn mower and I think it must have spooked him because he did a huge leap over the picket fence and bounced off into the field behind our house. ‘I tried to run after him but he was much too quick for me.’ Bigger than a dog: Ms Wiltshire thought it was a deer or fox until she got closer . Mr Fernando has had Skippy, an adult . male wallaby, for around six weeks after acquiring him from a private . collector in South Yorkshire. He . had planned to take Skippy, who usually lives in a large enclosure, to . Germany last Saturday, before he made a dash for freedom. Skippy . made headlines earlier this week when taxi driver Tomas Tarjan, 32, . spotted the wallaby hopping across the road while taking a group of . girls home in the middle of the night. He . said: 'This is the weirdest thing I have seen. I said to the girls I . was sure we did not live in Australia. We spent 40 to 50 minutes . searching for the animal. 'As I had my hazards on, several taxis stopped. When I said we were looking for a kangaroo they just asked me if I was alright.’ Jessica Wiltshire, 20, one of the passengers in the taxi, said she thought it was hilarious and managed to snap a picture of the marsupial, usually found in the Australia. She said: 'I quickly got my phone out and took a picture of it because I thought no one was going to believe me. ‘We thought it was a deer or fox in the road so the cab driver slowed down, but when we got closer we realised it was a wallaby. ‘It looked just like Skippy the kangaroo and was up on its hind legs, staring at us in the dark. It was a little bigger than an average dog.’ Still on the loose: Police did catch Skippy on Sunday after the sightings in Barton (pictured) but let him go after experts said it had probably spent all its life in the wild . After Skippy was released by police residents continued to spot the wallaby. Roger Northfield, a 70-year-old entomologist, photographed him on a farm belonging to the Countryside Restoration Trust in Barton, Cambridgeshire. He said: ‘I was out looking for insects . when I saw it at a distance. I moved closer and closer to it, taking . pictures. I knew that a wallaby had escaped. Wallabies are members of the kangaroo clan found primarily in Australia and on nearby islands. Wallabies are typically small to medium-sized mammals, but the largest can reach 6feet from head to tail. Motorists were warned to take caution on the A40 near Highnam, Gloucestershire after police received a number of calls from people saying they had seen a wallaby or kangaroo in July this year. A colony of wallabies made the Cornwall countryside their home after they escaped from a farm about five years ago. Several sightings were reported in 2010 of a male, female and baby in the St Breward area. ‘I was surprised to see it but I thought it might pop up.’ Experts had said that they believed the marsupial was descended from a group of wallabies which escaped from Whipsnade Zoo, Bedfordshire, in the 1950s. Experts believe the resourceful group have managed to survive off shrubs and vegetation and even breed despite the harsh British winters. That was until it was discovered that a wallaby had escaped from Mr Fernando’s care. Rebecca Willers, animal manager at Shepreth Wildlife Park, said: ‘We had a call from someone in the village who said there is a resident who keeps wallabies as pets. ‘It is highly likely that it is a pet as it is alone and they usually are found in groups. ‘I called the police again to make them aware it was probably a pet and I am willing to offer the owner our services to recapture the animal.’","The wallaby was thought to be living wild in Cambridgeshire but is actually a domestic pet .

Media demands: Lord O'Donnell told the Leveson inquiry today that David Cameron's links with the media were 'too close' while in opposition . David Cameron became too close to the media while he was in opposition, former cabinet secretary Gus O'Donnell said today. Lord O'Donnell - who retired as head of the civil service at the end of last year - said he tried to ensure ministers maintained a distance from the press. But, giving evidence to the Leveson Inquiry into press standards, he admitted that he had not always been successful. 'I think the Prime Minister himself, the current Prime Minister, has said that he felt his relationships had got too close, and I agree with that.' Mr Cameron admitted last July that he and other politicians had allowed themselves to get 'too close' to media proprietors and editors, and he has since said that relations were 'too cosy'. However, he has stressed that his contacts were not only with Rupert Murdoch's News International, but with a wide range of media organisations. Lord O'Donnell also said today that Andy Coulson should have declared a £40,000 shareholding in News Corp when being vetted so he could have unsupervised access to top secret material. In his evidence, Lord O'Donnell said that while in opposition parties should have a different relationship with journalists than Government ministers. He said: 'You have much fewer resources, so you do not have big press offices and the like, so you do tend to make closer personal relationships with journalists. 'There tends to have been swapping of mobile phone numbers, all of those sorts of things.' Scroll down for video . 'Too close to the media': David Cameron with Lord O'Donnell, then Sir Gus as Cabinet Secretary, inside No 10 shortly after the general election . Lord O'Donnell said MPs should be 'much more careful' once their party forms a government.'Every . single Secretary of State is subject to collective responsibilities . much more important in government than we see in opposition. We have to . be much more careful,' he said. He added that a lot of special advisers come from a media or PR background. The peer said that the inquiry had . an opportunity to issue guidelines specifically for opposition parties . on their relationships with the press. 'I . think you would want to put it to the leaders of all the parties, ""Here . is a set of rules that we think opposition parties should abide by"", he . said. Lord O'Donnell . said he had suggested to David Cameron that all meetings between Ministers and newspaper . editors and owners should be recorded in a transparency drive. However, . he said it would not be right to record all discussions between MPs and . journalists because they are part of the 'basic lifeblood' of . parliamentary life. He said editors 'are different because of the ability to very strongly support different political parties.' News Corp shares: Andy Coulson told the Leveson inquiry he held £40,000 worth of shares while he was Mr Cameron's press secretary in No 10 - and didn't realise the potential conflict of interest until afterwards . The former head of the civil service also said that Andy Coulson should have revealed his News Corp shareholding. Mr Coulson admitted to the inquiry on Friday that he held £40,000 worth of shares while he was Mr Cameron's press secretary in No 10. He said he only realised the potential conflict of interest after he left Downing Street. He said in his witness statement: 'I was never asked about any share or stock holdings and because I knew that I wasn't involved in any commercial issues, including the BSkyB bid, it never occurred to me that there could be a conflict of interest. 'In retrospect I wish I had paid more attention to it.' However, Lord O'Donnell said Mr Coulson was asked to sign a form . declaring any outside interests when he entered Downing Street but the shareholding was not disclosed - . although it should have been. A decision was taken to vet him so he could have unrestricted access to secret materials after the airline bomb plot when printer cartridges packed with explosives were found on planes. Lord O'Donnell said Mr Coulson needed more access to top secret documents. The press secretary already had undergone a full security check giving him substantial access to secret materials and supervised access to top secret materials. Questions have been raised about why Mr Coulson was cleared only to SC level 'security checked' in No 10, rather than the tougher DV or 'developed vetting' level. Tony Blair's former spin doctor Alastair Campbell was given the higher level of security clearance when he was in Downing Street. Lord O'Donnell said he had been keen to keep the numbers of people given the highest vetting to a minimum, to help avoid leaks. He added that he didn't know whether other former press secretaries had been cleared to DV level. The ex-News of the World editor resigned before the process was complete. He also pointed out that DV was designed to establish 'whether you are blackmailable... in terms of your position or your personal life'. 'It would not have gone into enormous detail about phone hacking, for example,' Lord O'Donnell said. Exit: Jeremy Hunt's special adviser Adam Smith who resigned last month after admitting that the contacts over the BSkyB bid had become too close . Lord O'Donnell said that Jeremy Hunt's aide Adam Smith should have dealt with the BSkyB fairly. Mr Smith resigned last month after . admitting that the contacts over the BSkyB bid had become too close. Labour has been demanding that Mr Hunt quit for allowing the situation . to get out of control. Lord O'Donnell said it was for . ministers to authorise their special advisers' activities, but there was . not likely to be a written record of instructions. 'I would have expected the minister to be clear about what his special adviser should be doing,' he said. He insisted that 'keeping all parties informed about process is perfectly reasonable, but not getting into substance'. He added that reviewing the bid was a 'quasi-judicial procedure' and there was an obligation to deal with it fairly. Lord O'Donnell said he was right to tell Gordon Brown not to launch an inquiry into media standards in the weeks before the general election. He said that if a probe was launched it should have been done with all-party agreement - which would have been difficult in March 2010. 'There were stories that there was more information out there and I think there was still a question mark as to whether more would emerge ... 'On the basis of what we knew then I would stick with that recommendation.' Asked whether he had been unwilling to pick up a 'hot potato', the peer replied: 'I would say it was clearly a big potato. The timing was not ideal. 'If you are going to do this it would be good to have all-party agreement. Trying to broker such a thing in the weeks leading up to a general election would be quite difficult.' 'Forgetful': Rupert Murdoch was accused of 'selective amnesia' over a key 1981 meeting as he bought The Times . News International hit out today at 'fantasy' allegations made about Rupert Murdoch's 'sinister' back-room dealings with politicians. Robert Jay QC, counsel for the Leveson Inquiry, was accused of 'headline grabbing' by suggesting the media mogul was suffering 'selective amnesia' about his discussions with Margaret Thatcher. The idea that the pair had made an implicit pact over lunch in 1981 to allow his purchase of The Times was a 'science fiction theory', according to the company's barrister Rhodri Davies QC. 'This is the stuff of fantasy,' he told Lord Justice Leveson. 'Deals cannot be done through telepathy. What are the terms? What is the duration, what is the quid pro quo?' Mr Davies said the documentary record had no evidence of an explicit or implicit deal to exchange favourable media coverage for favourable treatment. Mr Murdoch also had no reason to lie about having no recollection of the key lunch at Chequers, as Mr Jay suggested last week in 'headline-grabbing style', he added. 'It is against the rules, and for good reason, to raise such an issue after the witness has gone, rather than when he is here to answer for it, but never mind that,' Mr Davies said. 'Mr Murdoch has nothing to lie about. The documents tell the story.' Mr Davies accused Mr Jay of suggesting it was 'sinister' for newspapers such as The Sun to back politicans they agree with. 'That is exactly what they are meant to do, and are expected to do, as agents of a free press in a democracy,' he said. 'In Mr Jay's hands, the characteristics of a large readership, floating voters, an absence of immutable party loyalties, begin to sound sinister.'","Former cabinet secretary says all meetings between Ministers and newspaper editors and owners should be disclosed .

The proportion of GCSE students scoring at least five Cs, including in English and maths, has fallen for the first time, official figures show. The drop is said to be down to fewer English entries from private schools, but the harsh grading of this June's GCSE English exam is likely to have played a part. The news comes as more than 45,000 pupils prepare to resit their English GCSE exams in November. Tough exams: The number students achieving at least five A*-C GCSEs has dropped for the first time . The number of students in England who achieved five A*-C grades, including the two key subjects, is down almost half a per cent from 2011. This year 58.6 per cent of pupils in England achieved five A*-C grades, according to Government data. Thousands of pupils received lower than expected results in GCSE English in the summer after grade boundaries were raised between the January and June exams. Not improving: The proportion of students achieving at least five C's is down by half a per cent since last year . A report compiled by the Association . of School and College Leaders published last week blames the summer exam . for ‘enormous and unprecedented’ fluctuations in results. The number of sixth-formers awarded with at least three top A-level grades has fallen for the first time in four years. One in eight students at all English schools and colleges achieved at least three A*s or As in their exams, down from 13.1 per cent in 2011, according to Government statistics. The Department for Education data also shows that private school students are three times more likely to score top grades than their state-educated peers. The proportion of private school pupils achieving three or more A*-A grades dwarfed state schools with 30.6 per cent compared to 10.7 per cent and 7.9 per cent of those at further education colleges. Overall, 91.7 per cent of all students achieved two or more A-levels at grade E or higher, down from 94.1 per cent in 2011. And more boys than girls achieved three or more A-levels at grade A or higher (12.7 per cent compared with 12.2 per cent). One in four secondaries saw at least a 10 . per cent drop in the proportion of pupils securing a C and a fifth . suffered at least a 15 per cent fall. The report concludes sudden changes in . pass marks between January and June’s English GCSE sittings led to . large swings in results. In a . letter to the Commons education select committee, ASCL’s secretary . Brian Lightman said pupils had suffered a ‘gross injustice’. He renewed his demands for the English exams to be re-graded and for an independent inquiry. A . document attached to the letter shows one in four out of 3,000 state . secondary schools, some 750, saw large drops in their results. However, the official Government figures show a rise in pupils entered for all the subjects in the Government’s English Baccalaureate, with 25 per cent and 18.1 per cent achieving the EBacc. The EBacc qualifications is awarded to pupils who score a C grade or higher in English, maths, science, history or geography, and a language.

Kathryn Bartlett, 44, was overjoyed and looking forward to getting on with her life after undergoing chemotherapy and radiation treatment for two years since her diagnosis in 2010. But while heading to work in Cardiff her car was struck by Nathan Cleaver's Peugeot van as he drove back after working a night shift 100 miles away.

The Nursing and Midwifery Council must now decide whether her actions while manager between February 2008 and August 2010 at Amerind Grove home in Ashton, Bristol, amounted to misconduct and whether her fitness to practise is impaired. A former colleague told the hearing: ‘On one occasion, she told me about being abused over a car bonnet in a car park. ‘This was what she wanted to happen. She talked of a number of sexual partners and involved BDSM [Bondage, Discipline, Sadism, Masochism], sadomasochistic sex, where Lesley was the slave and her partner was the master. ‘She showed us bruises she got from her sexual activity and was quite open when sat in the reception area.’ The workmate, who has been granted anonymity by the hearing, said he was scared to report Weir for fear she would lose her temper. He also told how Weir had spanked him on two separate occasions, including in her office. Another former colleague said Weir had proudly showed off bruises on her buttocks and breasts, and talked of the ‘unspeakable things’ she liked having done to her. The hearing also heard how Weir had . lifted her skirt to flash a couple of pensioners as they visited a . friend admitted at the home. 'Unspeakable' sex acts: Weir told a former colleague about the number of sexual partners she had and bondage and sadomasochistic sex (file photo) Terry Lewis, 76, said he had complained underwear belonging to their friend, a 93-year-old dementia sufferer, had gone missing, to which Weir retorted that he should be ‘on knicker inspection’. She then told the man he could inspect her underwear first ‘because I’m not wearing any’ before lifting her skirt. The nurse was sacked from the home after bosses discovered that she had pocketed £900 of rent paid by a nurse who lived in a flat above the home. Weir stuffed the envelopes of cash into her diary instead of passing them to the home’s accountant and handed the money back when she was discovered in August 2010 claiming she always intended to pay it back. Weir, who is not attending the central London hearing, wrote to the NMC admitting the majority of charges, but denied flashing her buttocks or asking if the patient was ‘dead yet’. If the panel find that her fitness to practise is impaired, she could be struck off the nursing register. Mark Elliott, regional director, Bupa care homes said: 'Even though no residents were involved, Lesley Weir’s actions were deplorable for someone in a position of such responsibility. 'We dismissed her in 2010 and referred her to the NMC.' The hearing continues.","Lesley Weir showed colleagues marks on her body .

A wealthy restaurateur plead not guilty yesterday to four counts of attempted murder after police said he tried to cause his pregnant girlfriend to miscarry their child by poisoning her with a substance known to induce abortion. Joshua Woodward, 40, who at one time was a prominent restaurateur with eateries in New York City and Los Angeles, was held on $4million dollar bail following his plea. Prosecutors say he used misoprostol, a drug known to induce labor or cause early-stage abortions, to terminate his girlfriend's pregnancy in the fall of 2009. Scroll down for video . Accused: Joshua Woodward, 40, who at one time was a prominent restaurateur, was held on $4million dollar bail following his not guilty plea. He is pictured with Paris and Nicky Hilton, who have no connection to the case, at the opening of Table 8 VIP Opening Party in Los Angeles in 2007 . Woodward, who once co-owned Manhattan's exclusive Table 8 restaurant and the 8oz. Burger Bar restaurants in Miami and Los Angeles, turned himself in on Wednesday, nearly three years after the allegations first surfaced. Woodward's then girlfriend contacted the LAPD after she discovered a mysterious white powder in her underwear in the fall of 2009 after a liaison with Woodward. She then described the circumstances of their relationship. She said that from the beginning she planned to keep the child but Woodward was adamant about terminating the pregnancy. According to the affidavit obtained by the New York Daily News, the pregnancy caused a 'bitter' breakup of the pair. However, Woodward eventually told the unidentified woman, now 42, that he wanted to be involved and the pair reunited. His then girlfriend told police and prosecutors after they rekindled their relationship, Woodward would often dip his hand into his backpack or pocket before touching her intimately. Claim: Prosecutors say he used misoprostol, left, a drug known to induce labor or cause early-stage abortions, to terminate his girlfriend's pregnancy . A few hours after an encounter on October 18, 2009, she suffered severe cramping and miscarried. She later noticed a suspicious white powder substance on her underwear and contacted police. They identified the substance as misoprostol. Misoprostol was initially FDA approved for the prevention and treatment of ulcers, but can also be used to induce labor or miscarriages of early-term pregnancies. Police told her to hide the fact that she had lost the baby and invite Woodward over. When he arrived, he allegedly pulled a small piece of clear plastic with a powdery substance out of his pocket. 'With his right hand he pulled out a small piece of clear plastic with a white powdery substance from his right front pocket and started grinding the item on his pants just below the pocket,' a Los Angeles Police detective wrote in the 2009 court paperwork, according to the Daily News. Investigation: Woodward turned himself in on Wednesday, nearly three years after the allegations first surfaced. One of his restaurants, the former Table 8 in New York City, is pictured . The investigation in 2009 did not lead to formal charges and prosecutors have spent years securing evidence in the case. Investigators spent that time interviewing additional witnesses, combing through medical records and conducting further testing on the powder, according to the Los Angeles Times. 'In the interim, there's been further investigation and analysis, and we obviously now decided what we deem appropriate charges,' Deputy DA Habib Balian said to NBC. The Los Angeles Times reports that police have secured 'new evidence' against Woodward. Woodward's attorney, Mark Werksman, said there is still no case against his client. Misoprostol was initially FDA approved for the prevention and treatment of ulcers, but can also be used to induce labor or miscarriages of early-term pregnancies. The commercial name, Cytotec, carries a label that warns pregnant women not to use the drug to treat ulcers. The charges, he said, are an attempt to turn 'an unfortunate natural miscarriage of a 13-week-old fetus into a ghoulish attempted murder case.' 'Nothing has changed in the last three years except the prosecution's determination to blame Joshua Woodward for the miscarriage suffered by his girlfriend,' Mr Werksman said to the Los Angeles Times. 'The evidence marshaled against him is so weak and speculative as to be nonexistent."" His then girlfriend has declined to comment. The charges listed on court documents describe four instances from September 15 until October 25 when Woodward allegedly tried to induce an abortion. He is formally charged with 'the crime of attempted, willful, deliberate, and premeditated murder...a Felony,' the documents state, explicitly claiming that Woodward 'did unlawfully and with malice aforethought attempt to murder Baby Doe, a human fetus.' When asked why he was charged only with attempted murder rather than murder, a spokeswoman for Los Angeles District Attorney said 'We file charges based on the evidence. That is all we can say.' Criminal law attorneys interviewed by MailOnline suggested that in order to prove he did commit murder, the district attorney would have to prove the fetus was 'alive.' Since the fetus was not viable at 13 weeks, that might present a difficulty. Woodward's intent, they said, would be simpler to prove. Now a Florida resident, he faces four counts of life in prison. Woodward is no longer associated with the day-to-day of the restaurants he once co-owned.","Unidentified ex-girlfriend, 42, lost baby on October 18, 2009 .

If you imagine spies are recruited with a discreet tap on the shoulder in the colleges of Oxford or Cambridge, think again. For the first time, the secret services are looking to recruit dozens of school-leavers for apprenticeships. Bosses are looking for as many as 100 recruits as young as 18 to take a ‘degree in spying’ instead of going to university. The first spy apprentices will arrive at GCHQ on the west of Cheltenham this autumn to learn how to protect Britain from the threat of cyber terrorists .

They will be paid an unspecified salary as well as earning a foundation degree as they train. William Hague unveiled the scheme yesterday during a visit to Bletchley Park – GCHQ’s Second World War predecessor. The Foreign Secretary compared the . role of the new recruits to that of the Buckinghamshire base’s famous . ‘code-breakers’, who cracked the Enigma codes used by the Nazis. He said cyber-warfare was ‘one of the . greatest challenges of our time’ and that he wanted to find the ‘young . innovators’ who would be able to help confront it. Candidates need three A-levels or . equivalent qualification, including at least two C grades in a science, . technology or maths subject.

Andrew Wantling who has beaten a rare form of cancer and son James who has battled unrelated leukaemia for two years . A family has been left devastated after both a father and son were diagnosed with different types of aggressive cancer at odds of 14 million to one. Andrew Wantling, 48, was diagnosed with a lymphoblastic lymphoma - a rare form of the disease in adults - nine years ago. Accountant Andrew underwent 18 months of gruelling treatment, including a stem-cell transplant and made a full recovery. But just four years later, the family were left devastated for a second time when son James, 13, was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The teenager is still battling the . disease two years later, taking medication every day and undergoing . monthly chemotherapy. The family has been told there is no link between . the two cancers. They . have been told that the odds of both Andrew and James developing . different cancers are higher than winning the lottery - which are 14 . million to one. Mother Miranda Wantling, 46, said James was inspired by his father in his own cancer battle. She . said: 'The treatment has been very tough at times, but James has . managed to keep up with school work and stay in touch with friends. 'We know only too well how cancer affects a family. We . were told there is no link between the two cancers my husband and son . have been treated for and the chances of this happening are extremely . low. 'I don’t know the exact odds but we were told there was more chance of us winning the lottery.' The Wantlings, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, spent Christmas and Boxing Day - James’ birthday - 2010 in Bristol Royal Hospital for Children as he received treatment. The grammar-school student who loves music and plays the violin, faces another two years of treatment. It is hoped that he will be able to start playing his beloved rugby and other contact sports after the treatment finishes. The Wantling family are supporting Cancer Research UK and Channel 4¿s new campaign called Stand Up to Cancer . Mrs Wantling, a primary school teacher, added: 'It was very hard to go there for the second time, but it did mean that we knew what to expect in terms of treatment. 'The fact that Andrew has been through a very similar treatment has given James and the rest of the family a lot of strength. 'Although the treatment is continuing, James still tries to get to school every day and lead a full life.' The family, including the couple’s other children, Amelia, 21, Eleanor, 19, and Philip, 16, received support from a number of charities, including CLIC Sargent. Andrew has embarked on a number of fundraising campaigns to thank them for their help, including running the London Marathon, the Bristol half marathon and triathlons. He has already donated more than £3,000 to charity. The family are now supporting Cancer Research UK and Channel 4’s new campaign called Stand Up to Cancer.

Foie gras with truffle sauce, monkfish liver with pancetta jus....we've heard of haute cuisine, now it's time for 'oat cuisine'. Think of the word porridge and you will probably remember the steaming pile of Quaker Oats served up to keep you warm on the journey to school. But rather unexpectedly, this most solid of cereals has become a gourmet dish. Top New York chef Samantha Stephens is championing an exotic range of recipes that use the Scottish oats as their base. She calls her approach Extreme Oatmeal. Abandoning traditional toppings such as honey and milk, she serves porridge with pesto sauce, pumpkin puree and bacon. The menu includes Indian spiced oatmeal with raisins, sliced almonds, coconut milk, crystallised ginger, cardamom, vanilla and brown sugar; and Canadian oatmeal served with bacon, cheddar cheese, roasted apples, maple syrup and sea salt. But there's no need to travel to New York to partake in the Extreme Oatmeal trend. Porridge is so simple to make that anyone can experiment with unconventional ingredients. Flavours that suit risotto tend to work well with porridge. So how about a bowl of mushroom, parmesan and pancetta porridge for breakfast tomorrow? Flavours which work well with risotto also work with oats . Who said porridge was boring? Originally from Fairfax, Samantha Stephens now lives in New York City where she OatMeals, the cosy dining room in which she puts 'modern twists on an old-fashioned wholesome favourite'. Her idea for gourmet porridge stemmed from being an impoverished student looking for ways of spicing up cheap oats. These days, from her pretty perch on 3rd Street, Stephens uses her colourful imagination to conjure up ideas both sweet and savoury for warming, comforting, health-giving bowls of oatiny goodness. Some of the most decadent sounding concoctions served in OatMeals are the Pumpkin Pie - made from a pumpkin purée swirl, pecans, brown sugar, pumpkin spice and whole milk - the Shaved Parmesan - extra virgin olive oil, flaky sea salt, cracked pepper, bacon topping recommended - and the the Croque Monsieur - diced ham, gruyere cheese, nutmeg, steamed milk. The squidgy  treats can also be made to order with ingredients including Gorgonzola, carob chips, chia seesds, butterscotch chips, truffle oil, agave nectar, ginger, mini-marshmallows, pineapple and pesto.

An man has been reunited with his beloved 15-year-old dog two months after the pet wandered off on a camping trip and was feared eaten by coyotes. In a touching display of affection, Romeo the Nova Scotia Toller pounced into Mike Stotts' arms and licked his face after a couple from California tracked down Stotts to his home in Austin, Texas. Eli Madrid came across the dog near Hyde Memorial State Park near Santa Fe, New Mexico on Sunday and found Stotts' contact after calling the microchip company listed on Romeo's collar. 'It was surreal,' Stott, 60, told ABC News of the reunion. 'All . of a sudden it was back to normal, like he was never gone.' Happy to be home: Romeo appears to be smiling as he is reunited with owner Mike Stotts after two months . Until Romeo became lost on a camping trip two months ago, the man and dog, who was adopted from a shelter as a puppy, had been inseparable. Romeo would join Stotts everyday as he went to work as his business, an apartment-locating service, and the dog followed him on every hiking trip he went on - particularly enjoying swimming holes. But in August, they ventured to  Hyde Memorial State Park together and Stotts returned alone. 'The first night there it started raining a little bit, so I unzipped the tent to put up the rain flap, and apparently he snuck out and I didn’t notice,' Stotts said. Content: Stotts launched a three-day search after Romeo jumped out of his tent on a camping trip . Overjoyed: Romeo, a Nova Scotia Toller, and Stotts had been inseparable for 15 years . 'As soon as I noticed I went out looking with a lantern because there’s a big coyote problem in the park and I knew time was of the essence.' For the next three days, he searched for Romeo - posting fliers and enlisting the help of park rangers and fellow campers - but with no luck. 'By that last day I'd given up,' Stotts said. 'Everyone said there was no way he could survive. 'I put a little cross memorial up on the mountain the last time I went up looking for him. I wanted to picture him that way instead of being eaten by coyotes.' He returned home to Austin but missed his companion of 15 years. Even visiting a rescue shelter in the hopes of adopting a new dog did not help, and he left empty handed. Relief: Stotts had microchipped Romeo years ago so he could be located when the dog was found . But on Monday, he received a call from a company that manufactures microchips implanted under animals' skin in case they are lost. Romeo had a chip implanted years ago, Stotts said. They had been called by Eli Madrid, who had found the dog five miles from the nearest camping ground. 'My first thought was that I better not get too excited because I thought they'd found his remains,' Stotts said. But he jumped in his car with his girlfriend and drove 12 hours to Santa Fe. They were finally reunited with Romeo on Tuesday afternoon. 'It was indescribable because it was like . seeing a loved one resurrected,' Stotts said . Lost: Romeo vanished at Hyde Memorial State Park near Santa Fe, New Mexico in August and was eventually found at the weekend five miles from the nearest camping ground . Romeo, who is partially deaf, had lost a great deal of weight and had a tear on his ear, but is expected to make a full recovery, ABC reported. 'It’s a testament to the will to survive,' Stotts said. 'Here he is a little coddled house dog, but his instincts kicked in when necessary.' Stotts thanked Madrid and his wife Jamie for caring for his pet and making the effort to contact him.

A gate used for the movement of water.’ When asked by the coroner if Laurence may have become stuck on the gate, Inspector Wood said he could not confirm either way. Family ties: Laurence had a 'special relationship' with his grandmother, who lived nearby . He . said: ‘The examination of both the recovered bodies indicated no form . of assault and there was nothing suspicious at the scene.’ Coroner .

The open-top racer was tipped onto its side and then smashed into the tyre wall before landing on its wheels during the the practice session of the 15th annual Petit Le Mans in Road Atlanta. Scroll down for video: . Moment of impact: Gunnar Jeannette was testing the Nissan DeltaWing when his vehicle was tipped onto its side and then smashed into the tyre wall . The driver gets turned so that all the pressure lands on his helmet - experiencing forces of 7G during impact . Danger: Jeannette experiences a potentially fatal experience as his helmet is dragged across tarmac and grass following the collision . Terrifying on-board footage from Nissan appears to show Jeannette's helmet being dragged across tarmac and grass following the collision. However, he is being protected by the car's roll hoops which held firm - preventing a near-certain catastrophe. Jeannette, 30, emerged from the wreck unscathed and, after a short trip to the hospital, was released having suffered no injuries. The impact generated a staggering 7Gs, according to the team's telemetry system. Jeannette later described the incident as ""not the best of practice sessions"", after being sent ""for a bit of a ride"". Batman-like: The Nissan DeltaWing Supercar can travel up to 185mph . He added: ""Luckily, the guys built a very strong car. While the damage looks to be bad in photographs, the car took the impact quite well. ""We have all the spare parts to fix it and we have an excellent crew that got to work straight away and had the car stripped down remarkably quickly."" The Nissan DeltaWing has been dubbed the Batmobile because of its unconventional design looks and stealthy paintjob.

China's Bayan Obo mine produces around half the world's supply of the 17 'rare earth' metals - metals crucial to high-end electronics such as mobile phones, telephones, hi-tech cars and weaponry. Few Western journalists have ever visited the open-cast mine in China's Inner Mongolia - and with reason. It spews out 420,000 cubic feet of toxic gas for every ton of rare metal mined, along with acidic waste water and radioactive material. Nasa's Terra satellite has captured the growth of the secretive facility over five years - as China aims to stockpile rare earths to gain an economic advantage against the West. [caption . Rare-earths are so-called because when they were first discovered in the 19th Century in Sweden, they were believed to be some of the most uncommon elements.But through further scientific discovery, rare-earths have been found to be relatively abundant in the Earth's crust. However, the high cost of extraction means that only areas with rich deposits are worth exploiting.Rare-earth metals are typically malleable. They also have high electrical conductivity.They are often extracted from minerals through a process that involves dissolving elements in different liquids - usually water and a solvent.There are 17 rare-earths and their purposes include being used in shielding for nuclear reactors, fibre optics, flatscreen displays and earthquake monitoring equipment. In 2008, China supplied 139,000 tons worldwide, 97 per cent of the world's total rare-earth production. The architect of modern China, Deng . Xiaoping, realised the significance of the elements lurking in the arid . wastes of Inner Mongolia almost 20 years ago when he said: 'There is oil . in the Middle East but there is rare-earth in China.' With names like cerium, lanthanum, and ytterbium, rare earth elements aren’t exactly household names. But the consumer products they are used in - such as magnets, camera lenses, and batteries - certainly are.There are 17 rare earth elements in all, but these key metals aren’t as rare as the name suggests. (In fact, some are relatively abundant in Earth’s crust.) The vast majority of rare earths—96 percent of the market—come from China. China has a stranglehold on the . global supply of 17 rare earth materials essential for making high-end . goods such as hybrid cars, camera lenses, mobile phones and weapons. About half come from Bayan Obo, a single mine. On July 2, 2001 (below) and June 30, 2006 (above), the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) on NASA’s Terra satellite acquired these false-color views of the mine in the Nei Mongol Autonomous Region.Vegetation appears red, grassland is light brown, rocks are black, and water surfaces are green. Two circular open-pit mines are visible, as well as a number of tailings ponds and tailings piles. Use the image comparison tool to see how the mine has grown larger since 2001. According to a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) report, China produced about 81,000 tons of rare earth metals in 2001; the number jumped to about 120,000 by 2006.Such an intensive mining operation has a definite impact on the surrounding environment. According to the Chinese Society of Rare Earths, 9,600 to 12,000 cubic meters (340,000 to 420,000 cubic feet) of waste gas—containing dust concentrate, hydrofluoric acid, sulfur dioxide, and sulfuric acid—are released with every ton of rare metals that are mined. Approximately 75 cubic meters (2,600 cubic feet) of acidic wastewater, plus about a ton of radioactive waste residue are also produced. Around 100 miles south of Baiyun Obo, . larger rare-earth refineries sit around the banks of the world's largest . tailing lake, Baogang - seven square miles of evil-smelling toxic waste . that shows the shocking extent of this industry's impact.

Vegetation appears red, grassland light is brown, rocks are black, and water surfaces are green. According to a USGS report, the United States has enough rare earth elements in the ground to meet global demand for decades to come. But until California’s Mountain Pass Mine recently reopened, few of these minerals were being mined in the U.S.","One single mine produces half the world's supply of 'rare earth' metals .

A high school student who 'Tebowed' on stage at his graduation ceremony was denied his diploma for the stunt. Chuck Shriner, 17, dropped on one knee in front of his principal on Saturday during Bishop Verot's graduation ceremony. Inspired by Tim Tebow, the New York Jets stand-in quarterback, the move mimics the football star's trademark pose of dropping to one knee and resting his hand on his forehead as he prays. After his comedy moment, Shriner was told the school would withhold his diploma  - and later gave it to his mother instead. The teenager told Naples News: 'They said what I did would give underclassmen inspiration to do something else, that it might lead to something else.' Shriner, who plays football at the private Catholic school in Fort Myers, Florida, saw the audience erupt into laughter - but unfortunately his mother was not one of those who saw the funny side. Along with being denied his diploma, Mr Shriner's mother, who is a math teacher, arranged for her son to clean the school gym as punishment. The 17-year-old is due to start at the University of Central Florida studying mechanical engineering. He said that he was put up to the dare by his classmates - who rewarded him with five dollars for his trouble. He cleaned the school gym yesterday but added: 'I think it was worth it.'

One surgeon who had just performed life-saving surgery was even snapped striking the pose. Celebrities were quick to jump on the Tebowing bandwagon with everyone from Alec Baldwin, Katy Perry, Maria Menounos and Robert Downey Jr adopting the move for the camera. Earlier this month, a dateless senior asked Tebow to her prom - and when she didn't hear back from him, decided to take a cardboard cut-out of the Jets player instead.

"By . Hugo Gye . UPDATED: . 18:27 EST, 25 February 2012 . The son of Robert F. Kennedy has been arrested for allegedly attacking two nurses who tried to stop him removing his newborn baby from hospital. Douglas Kennedy, a journalist, is charged with harassment and endangering the welfare of a child following the altercation, which happened last month. He is alleged to have twisted the arm of one nurse and kicked another in the crotch as they tried to make sure his two-day-old son Boru was not being treated roughly. Charges: Douglas Kennedy, pictured with wife Molly and one of their children, was arrested this week . Hospital: Mr Kennedy is shown in security footage trying to take his newborn son for a walk . Mr Kennedy strongly refutes the charges, and told NBC New York the claims were 'absurd'. The accusations date from January 7, when Mr Kennedy, 44, was visiting his wife Molly and their newborn son - the couple's fourth - in Northern Westchester Hospital in New York. Mr and Mrs Kennedy then started to take the baby for a walk outside, but were stopped by nurses concerned for the boy's safety. They asked him to return the newborn to the emergency room, but he refused - encouraged by Dr Timothy Haydock, a family friend who works at the hospital. When Mr Kennedy ignored them and walked in to the elevator, nurses triggered a 'code pink', which alerts staff that someone is trying to abduct a baby. 'Attack': A figure shown falling over in the hospital corridor is said to be a nurse kicked in the crotch by Mr Kennedy . Fall: Mr Kennedy is also said to have twisted the arm of a nurse who tried to block his way . Police said that one nurse, Anna Margaret Lane, stood in Mr Kennedy's way, so he grabbed her wrist and twisted it to move her out of the way. A police statement continued that the baby's head started to 'move from side to side, and in an attempt to stabilize the baby's head, nurse Cari Maleman Luciano reached toward the infant's head.' Ms Luciano told authorities: 'Instinctively as a nurse, I raised both my arms toward the neck of the baby to steady the violent shaking of the baby's head and neck.' But Mr Kennedy then allegedly kicked her in the pelvis and caused her to fall over. In security footage of the incident, a figure can be seen to fall backwards away from the elevator. Mr Kennedy then fell on the floor, still holding his son, and jumped up to run downstairs, according to the police report, but was 'stopped by security and escorted back to the infant's room'. Accused: Douglas Kennedy, pictured with his wife Molly, has been charged with harassment and endangerment of a child following an incident last month . Scene: The altercation happened at the Northern Westchester Hospital in suburban New York on January 7 . Family: Mr Kennedy is pictured as a baby with his parents Bobby and Ethel Kennedy, months before the assassination of the former Attorney General and presidential candidate . He was charged with the alleged offences on Thursday. The Kennedys deny any wrongdoing, and said in a statement: 'The nurse had no right to attempt to grab our child out of his father's arms and I, Douglas, was shocked and appalled when she did so.' The family's lawyer told the Daily News: 'This is nothing more than a money grab.' Dr Haydock has supported the couple's story and claimed that 'the nurses were the only aggressors'. Mr Kennedy is a reporter and occasional presenter for Fox News, having started his career with the New York Post. He is the tenth son of Bobby Kennedy, the U.S. senator, Attorney General and presidential candidate who was assassinated in 1968, five years after the death of his brother JFK.","Douglas Kennedy, 44,fought with nurses at suburban New York hospital .

Brainwave-controlled robot radiation suits could be used to protect engineers working in the disaster zone around the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant. Researchers in Japan showed of the latest incarnation of HAL - Hybrid Assistive Limb - a full-body suit that allows wearers to don heavy radiation protection without feeling the burden. HAL – coincidentally the name of the evil supercomputer in Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey – has a network of sensors that monitor the electric signals coming from the wearer's brain. It uses these to activate the robot's limbs in concert with the worker's, taking weight off his or her muscles. Poised: HAL on display at the Japan Robot Week exhibition yesterday. The new type of robot suits are to be used by workers at nuclear disaster sites and will be field tested at TEPCO's Fukushima power plant . Yoshiyuki Sankai, professor of engineering at the University of Tsukuba, said this means the 130lb (60kg) tungsten vest workers at Fukushima have to wear is almost unnoticeable. He said the outer layer of the robot suit also blocks radiation, while fans inside it circulate air to keep the wearer cool, and a computer can monitor their heart-rate and breathing for signs of fatigue. The robot is manufactured by . Cyberdyne, a company unrelated to the fictional firm responsible for the . Terminator in the 1984 film of the same name. HAL . was on display yesterday as part of Japan Robot Week, which also featured small . robots that run on caterpillar tracks designed to move across difficult . terrain and gather information in places where it is not safe for . humans. Strong: HAL picks up on traces of nerve signals to move in concert with its user, enabling him or her to carry heavy objects more easily, left. Right, Yoshiyuki Sankai, Cyberdyne president, shows off the pioneering suit . Cyberdyne have developed the technology for a range of purposes, including also as an assistive device for disabled people. The company described the suit as a 'cyborg-type' robot that can supplement, expand or improve physical ability. HAL works by scanning the user's skin to detect very weak traces of nerve signals sent by the brain to the muscles via motorneurons. Based on the signals it receives, the device moves its joints in unison with wearers' muscle movements, supporting their daily activities.

A huge tsunami in March 2011 smashed into the power plant, sparking meltdowns that forced the evacuation of a huge area of northeastern Japan. The decommissioning of the crippled plant is expected to take several decades.","HAL detects traces of nerve signals to move in concert with its user .

Louis Smith looked more than happy to take on the challenge as he practised with professional dance partner Flavia Cacace this week. The pair are set to recreate some of the famous sequences from the 1987 film Dirty Dancing, starring Swayze and Jennifer Grey.

UPDATED: . 09:39 EST, 18 October 2012 . Cyndi Lauper's classic disco hit Girl's Just Wanna Have Fun is increasingly becoming out-dated after it was revealed that it is actually men who have more fun. According to the latest study, a third of women admit being ‘a bit boring’ after getting stuck in a rut in their work and social lives while they are convinced men are having a better time. Balancing full-time employment with raising a family leaves women with less time to relax or let their hair down on nights out with friends. A third of women admit being 'a bit boring' while they are convinced men are having a better time - a view shared by many British men . Many women believe men have more fun than they do, with three quarters saying it is because partners have 'less responsibility in the home' and over half believing it's down to men caring less about what others think of them. And 39 per cent say men are more joyful, simply because they have busier social lives. But it seems personality also has a role to play, with some women admitting they are just too shy to get the party started. Only one in seven women claim to take the lead as an 'extrovert' or 'instigator of fun'. Furthermore, just five per cent of women say they make themselves laugh most, while a third say their husband or boyfriend is most likely to make them giggle. As a result, a mere 17 per cent believe of women they are more fun than their male counterparts and 35 per cent admit being boring. This is in stark contrast to men with a quarter of British males viewing themselves as fun-loving extroverts and eleven per cent even insist they make themselves laugh more than anyone else. Because of busy work schedules and the pressures of raising a family, women are finding it harder to enjoy their social life . Consultant psychologist Anjula Mutanda . said: 'Women feel they are still shouldering more of the household . responsibilities, giving them less time to step back and have fun. 'Couples need to stop psychologically dividing household tasks into men’s and women’s work and adopt a more 50/50 approach. 'Women also tend to laugh more when a man tells a joke than vice versa. 'This affects how a woman may behave and her confidence about being seen to be the instigator of fun and humour.' The . research, by bingo website Jackpotjoy, also found that men dominate . lists of people we think are most fun and who make us laugh. Funny man Alan Carr and Mayor Boris Johnson were voted as the ideal best friends because they look fun, according to the survey . Chatty man TV host Alan Carr is the celebrity Brits most want as a best friend because he is the 'most fun'. Mop-haired mayor of London Boris Johnson came second in the poll, with 16.5 per cent, and flirty comic Russell Brand third, with 10 per cent. Barbara Windsor has launched the new £250k Jackpotjoy.com FUNdation on Facebook that grants FUNds for daft ideas.

Mr Fogle, who presented the popular show between 2006 and 2008, said he doesn’t agree with the breed requirements set by the Kennel Club, who own the franchise. Sadness: Ben Fogle (left) spoke for all dog lovers when he revealed his grief at losing his labrador Inca (right) He said: ‘I don’t mind saying that I am glad we stopped coverage of Crufts until the Kennel Club change their standards because breeding shouldn’t all be about aesthetics and looks, it should be about health’. Happy memories: In July, the 38-year-old presenter admitted that he 'couldn't stop crying' after he was forced to put down Inca. They are pictured in 2001 . The BBC dropped Crufts from their coverage in 2009 after not being able to agree to the breeding terms with the Kennel Club. The decision came shortly after a BBC documentary which claimed that over-breeding had caused major health problems in breeds including bulldogs, boxers and pugs. In July, the 38-year-old presenter admitted that he ‘couldn’t stop crying’ after he was forced to put down his 12-year-old Labrador, Inca. The loveable dog, which had epilepsy, was Mr Fogle’s trusty sidekick and was with him when he got his first television break. Twelve years ago, Mr Fogle was selected to be one of 36 unknowns to spend a year on the Island of Taransay for the BBC reality show Castaway in 2000. Allowed one luxury, he opted to bring Inca, whom he had bought as a puppy for £1,500, picking name that was inspired by his travels in South America. And Mr Fogle, who also met his wife Marina when he was out walking with Inca, revealed that he believed the Labardor’s illness was ‘pretty much unquestionably’ down to his pedigree breeding. Speaking to Dogs Today magazine, Mr Fogle confessed that he is still coming to terms with Inca’s loss. He said: ‘I described Inca as my shadow and, although I like to think about my relationship with Inca was deeper than anyone else’s because she helped me find a job and a wife, I am aware that my story is mirrored all across the UK and all across the world’. Last month, Mr Fogle released a book the Accidental Naturalist. Not impressed: Mr Fogle, who presented Crufts between 2006-2008 (show pictured in 2007), said he doesn't agree with the breed requirements set by the Kennel Club who own the franchise . In the self-penned memoir which he . describes as a ‘eulogy’ to Inca, the TV star said he wanted to encourage . people not to feel shy about grieving for an animal. He said: ‘The brutal reality is that we all outlive our dogs and we will all go through this bereavement. 'I . wanted to share my experience to help people I suppose, so that people . understand that you shouldn’t be embarrassed to grieve’. And Mr Fogle added that the unique kind of grief that follows the death of an animal can be difficult to comprehend. Couple: Mr Fogle, who was recently made a special correspondent by NBC News in the US, lives in London with his wife of six years, Marina (left) and their two children - a son Ludo, two, and a one-year-old daughter Iona . He said: ‘If you’re not an animal person, if you’re not a dog owner, it is hard to understand how a fluffy, furry creature on four legs, who can’t talk, can have this effect on you’. 'I don't mind saying that I am glad we stopped coverage of Crufts until the Kennel Club change their standards because breeding shouldn’t all be about aesthetics and looks, it should be about health' Ben Fogle . In his 12-year career, Mr Fogle has become one of Britain’s most popular presenters.

Killer Jeremy Bamber has lost the first stage of his latest legal battle over his convictions for murdering five members of his family more than 25 years ago. A High Court judge in London has rejected Bamber's bid for a judicial review of an earlier decision not to refer his case back to the Court of Appeal for the safety of his convictions to be looked at once more. The 51-year-old is serving a whole life term for murdering his wealthy adoptive parents, his sister and her two children in a remote Essex farmhouse in 1985. He has always protested his innocence. Killer: Bamber, seen left in 2011, and being taken away by police following his murder trial in 1986, was seeking a judicial review of an earlier decision not to refer his case to the Court of Appeal . The decision not to refer Bamber's case back to the Court of Appeal was made earlier this year by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), an independent body which investigates possible miscarriages of justice. A Judicial Office spokeswoman today confirmed that a judge had turned down Bamber's application for permission for a judicial review. It is still open to Bamber to seek to renew his application before the full court. Murdered: Bamber's parents, Neville and June, left, and his sister Sheila with her twin sons Daniel and Nicholas, right . Bamber, who has been behind bars for over 25 years for the 1985 killings, claims his schizophrenic sister Sheila Caffell shot her family before turning the gun on herself in the farmhouse in Tolleshunt D'Arcy, Essex. He was convicted in 1986 of killing his parents June and Neville, his sister Ms Cafell, and her six-year-old twin sons Daniel and Nicholas on August 7, 1985. Bamber's sister Sheila 'Bambi' Caffell, pictured, was a former model . Bamber's latest request for an appeal was based on a fresh analysis of three burn marks found on his father and gunshot wounds on his sister which suggested they were not killed with a weapon fitted with a silencer, which suppresses the sound of a gunshot. His trial in 1986 was told he had shot his family using a weapon fitted with such a device, and that he had later removed it. When announcing its decision not to refer the case to the Court of Appeal in April the CCRC said that, despite a lengthy and complex investigation, it 'has not identified any evidence or legal argument that it considers capable of raising a real possibility that the Court of Appeal would quash the convictions'. In July this year it emerged the mass . killer was again pursuing a challenge against the decision to hand him a . whole-life term because it is 'inhuman and degrading'. Bamber . appealed after Europe's human rights judges ruled in January that . Britain's most notorious killers could be kept behind bars for the rest . of their lives. The ruling will be tested in . Strasbourg's Grand Chamber, the appeal court of the European Court of . Human Rights, next month. Two . other British killers - Douglas Vinter, who stabbed his wife in 2008, . and Peter Moore, who killed four men in 1995 - will also have their . appeals heard in cases that will test whether the UK's law allowing the . most dangerous offenders to be sentenced to whole-life tariffs is cruel. In 2009, Bamber lost a . Court of Appeal challenge against the order that he must die behind . bars. He has twice lost appeals against conviction. He is being held at Full Sutton prison in York.","Killer's bid for a judicial review of an earlier decision not to refer his case back to the Court of Appeal has been rejected by a High Court judge .

Neglect: Janette Milne has been banned from owning a dog for two years after her emaciated pet bull terrier had to be put down after swallowing a plug and cable . The owner of a dog that died after swallowing an electric plug and cable has been banned from keeping animals for two years. Janette Milne failed to get treatment for her English bull terrier Henry - which was found emaciated and unable to lift its head at her home in Inverness. An x-ray later revealed the animal had swallowed the objects, badly damaging his intestines, and was humanely put down . because of the injuries he had suffered. The ruling banning Milne from keeping animals came yesterday after an investigation by Scottish SPCA investigators. Milne, of South . Kessock, was convicted at Inverness Sheriff Court in August of causing the dog unnecessary suffering. The twenty-eight year-old had . been given Henry only six weeks before he died. At a previous court hearing Milne’s solicitor Jim Friel said she did not want to lose the right to keep a dog. Sheriff Ian Abercrombie had deferred . sentence until this week because social background reports on Milne had not addressed her suitability to care for animals in the future. Milne had, however, admitted causing the dog unnecessary suffering by failing to provide adequate . treatment. The court had heard that when Scottish SPCA inspectors found the sick animal at her home, it was so emaciated and . unwell it was unable to even lift its head. Swallowed: An x-ray of the dog shows the electric cable and plug inside it. The hungry dog had been fed by worried neighbours before its death . Deputy fiscal Heather Swan described . at a previous hearing how Scottish SPCA inspector Gill MacGregor visited . Milne’s home and went upstairs with her partner to see Henry. 'He was extremely unwell, emaciated, unable to move or lift his head,' she said. 'Milne told the inspector the dog had . been ill for three days and [that] neighbours had been feeding him with . mushrooms which made him unwell,' said the fiscal. Sad: Ms Milne left the English bull terrier (like this one) in a terrible condition before its death (file picture) Ms MacFarlane said Milne regretted what had happened to Henry and accepted she should have sought help for the dog sooner. But because of her personal circumstances she had not registered him with a vet. 'She said she felt the dog was stressed because of its change of environment, said Ms MacFarlane. 'It is accepted by her she should have taken much more urgent action. She obviously panicked when it became known to her how seriously ill the dog was and is very much devastated by the pain and suffering caused.' Ms McFarlane said the social work report on Milne said she was a woman with a genuine fondness of animals but because of her personal circumstances was not able to react to her dog's ill health. She said Milne was concerned 'there may be an order which affects her ownership of a dog.' Sheriff Peter Anderson told Milne he accepted what had been said about her life and circumstances. 'But the fact remains you did not do anything to help it. I can’t ignore that fact,' he said. He imposed a £300 fine as well as banning Milne from keeping a dog for two years. Solicitor Diane McFarlane said Milne . and her partner had another dog that belongs to him. The ban on Milne does not affect him.","English bull terrier was put down because of damage to his intestines .

Rwanda's defence minister is commanding a rebellion in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo that is being armed by Rwanda and Uganda, according to the United Nations. Both countries sent troops to aid the insurgency in a deadly attack on UN peacekeepers, it is claimed. The UN Security Council's Group Of Experts said in a confidential report that Rwanda and Uganda - despite their strong denials - continued to support M23 rebels in their six-month fight against Congolese government troops in North Kivu province. A woman walks with her child in the Kanyaruchinya camp for internally displaced people near the city of Goma in east Congo. The UN has claimed that Rwanda's defence minister is commanding a rebellion in the region . 'Both Rwanda and Uganda have been supporting M23,' said the 44-page report. 'While Rwandan officials coordinated the creation of the rebel movement as well as its major military operations, Uganda's more subtle support to M23 allowed the rebel group's political branch to operate from within Kampala and boost its external relations.' Bosco Ntaganda, a former Congolese general wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes, controls the rebellion on the ground and M23 leader Sultani Makenga is in charge of operations and coordination with allied armed groups, the UN report said. Both Ntaganda and Makenga 'receive direct military orders from RDF (Rwandan army) Chief of Defense staff General Charles Kayonga, who in turn acts on instructions from Minister of Defense General James Kabarebe,' it said. Uganda and Rwanda have denied the accusations of involvement by the UN experts, who monitor compliance with sanctions and an arms embargo on the Congo and delivered their report to the Security Council's Congo sanctions committee earlier this month. 'Rwandan officials exercise overall command and strategic planning for M23,' the report said. 'Rwanda continues to violate the arms embargo through direct military support to M23 rebels, facilitation of recruitment, encouragement and facilitation of FARDC (Congolese army) desertions as well as the provision of arms and ammunition, intelligence, and political advice. 'UPDF (Ugandan army) commanders sent troops and weapons to reinforce specific M23 operations and assisted in M23's recruitment and weapons procurement efforts in Uganda,' it said. Nearly half a million people have been displaced due to the fighting. M23 has proven so resilient that one senior UN diplomatic source said Rwanda has effectively 'annexed' mineral-rich eastern Congo thanks to the rebel force. Rebel leader? Bosco Ntaganda, a former Congolese general wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes, controls the rebellion on the ground, according to the UN . UN peacekeeping chief Herve Ladsous . said last month that the rebels had set up de facto administration in . eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, controlling the people and . collecting taxes. The rebellion is also being funded by traders in Rwanda who are profiting from tin, tungsten and tantalum smuggled across the border from mines in the eastern DRC, according to the UN report. An interim report from the Group of Experts that was published in June raised similar accusations against Rwanda but with far less detail. Kigali was furious about that report, saying it was one-side and contained false allegations. Rwanda has backed armed movements in the Congo during the past two decades, citing a need to tackle Rwandan rebels operating out of Congo's eastern hills. The new report said that M23 had expanded its control of Rutshuru Territory with extensive foreign support in July 2012 and had taken advantage of a recent informal ceasefire 'to expand alliances and command proxy operations elsewhere'. Rwandan President Paul Kagame denied any involvement in the Congo rebellion at a high-level meeting in New York last month . The experts said that units of the Ugandan and Rwandan armies 'jointly supported M23 in a series of attacks in July 2012 to take over the major towns in Rutshuru Territory, and the (Congolese army) base of Rumangabo'. During these attacks, the rebels killed a UN peacekeeper and fired on a UN peacekeeping base at Kiwanja. The report said: 'According to several M23 soldiers, RDF troops provided the rebels with heavy weapons such as 12.7mm machine guns, 60mm, 91mm and 120mm mortars, as well as anti-tank and anti-aircraft launchers ahead of the attack. 'RDF Special Forces in Rutshuru also aided the rebels and fired 13 rounds on a FARDC (Congolese army) combat helicopter during the takeover of Kiwanja.' Ugandan military spokesman Felix Kulayigye rejected the report. He said: 'Where's the evidence for their claims? Some of those so-called experts came here and did not interview anyone. Where's their authentic facts to back those claims? Those accusations are absolute rubbish, hogwash.' Olivier Nduhungirehe, senior Rwandan diplomat at the country's UN mission made a similar denial. He said the UN experts have been 'allowed to pursue a political agenda that has nothing to do with getting at the true causes of conflict in the eastern DRC'. Rwandan President Paul Kagame reiterated Rwanda's denials at a high-level meeting in New York last month that both he and Congolese President Joseph Kabila attended. The Group of Experts said that it has corroborated its findings with multiple intelligence sources. The report said: 'Various South African Development Community (SADC), European, Ugandan, and Burundian intelligence agents also confirmed the group's findings concerning Rwandan violations of the (arms) embargo.' It added that the Rwandans have stepped up recruitment for M23, which has around 1,250 soldiers. 'M23 faces challenges in carrying out independent operations and controlling heavily guarded positions due to troop shortages,' said the report. It said the Rwandan army was targeting Rwandan demobilised soldiers and civilians and Congolese refugees to recruit for M23, while M23 itself has stepped up its use and recruitment of child soldiers. Since May, the experts said M23 has recruited some 250 children and killed dozens who tried to escape. The report said: 'Furthermore, certain M23 commanders have ordered the extrajudicial executions of dozens of recruits and prisoners of war. 'M23 uses boys on the front-lines as cover for advancing units, often after a week of training. Others act as porters, intelligence operatives and bodyguards. The rebels use young girls as cooks and as commanders' wives.'","Both countries sent troops to aid the insurgency in a deadly attack on UN peacekeepers, it is claimed .

The teenagers were found during a company investigation at its factory in the eastern city of Yantai and sent back to school.

Last month, Foxconn suspended production for an entire day at a factory in the city of Taiyuan after a brawl involving as many as 2,000 employees, in which 40 people were injured. The Fair Labor Association, which was hired by Apple to audit working conditions at Foxconn factories, said in August that improvements it recommended in March were being carried out ahead of schedule. That included verifying the ages of student interns.","Minimum working age in China is 16 .

'A private plane was flown out of New York to take guests to Italy, including both their publicists,' a source told the newspaper.

That’s something I learned from . both my stepdad and my grandfather - that there is a thing called . chivalry and it doesn’t have to die with the birth of the internet. 'The way I see it, if you’re asking a girl out on a date, it’s only right to do it in a way that she can hear your voice.' But because he was a big name popstar at the time, not to mention a former Mouseketeer, it was not an easy sell. Getting ready: Some guests stroll through the grounds of the château where the nuptials are said to be taking place . Pre-party: The wedding guests dressed casually for the drinks, as they mingled in the rustic surroundings . New photograph: The Timberlake picture was first seen on Life & Style's website, with the new issue out now . The SexyBack singer admitted: 'I had to be pretty persistent in order to get her to say yes. 'But I have a fair amount of tenacity and if I want something I stick to it. And in the end she agreed.' He also said that their most important quality as a couple is their willingness to work hard on their relationship. He said: 'Some days are better than . other days for all of us - and if we have our good days and bad days . individually, and then we’re dealing with someone else’s good and bad . days on top of that, it’s going to add up. 'But what I have learned from my stepdad is something as important, which is patience and compassion. 'Because when you are living with someone else, those two qualities go a long way.' Jessica has meanwhile insisted she has not turned into a fearsome 'bridezilla' in the run-up to the big day. She told E!

A schoolboy has stunned medics by fighting back from the brink of death on two separate occasions in just over a year. Kyle Reeve, 14, fractured his skull in a bike accident in June 2011, leaving him in a coma on a life support machine. Doctors told his family he might not pull through but, amazingly, he recovered from his injuries and was sent home. Miracle boy: 14-year-old Kyle Reeve has come back from the brink of death twice in just over a year . Then in August of this year, the teenager fell victim to a potentially deadly form of meningitis that caused unconsciousness and seizures. Again doctors feared for his life, and his mother said they told her Kyle might have contracted the condition due to his earlier skull fracture. Mother Nicky, from Alvaston, Derbyshire, recalls how the nurses who helped save Kyle’s life before could not believe he was back in hospital. 'They didn’t think he’d make it. It was like history repeating itself.' But battling Kyle pulled through and has now gone back to school. Intensive care: After breaking his skull in a BMX accident, Kyle was in a coma on life support for three days . Nicky kept a vigil at her son’s hospital bedside in June 2011 after he fractured his skull falling off his bike. 'I remember seeing Kyle playing on a climbing frame and I told him to get down as I didn’t want him to get hurt. 'Then later he went out with his friends on his bike and I got a call asking me to pick him up because he’d come off the bike. 'I was scared he’d died and went straight down there. When we got to Alvaston Park he was lying on the floor and looked quite a mess. 'In the ambulance, his eyes started rolling back in his head. He was fighting and kicking. It was horrible. He kept trying to get up and get the collar off his neck.' Kyle was taken straight to the accident and emergency department at the Royal Derby Hospital and had tests and X-rays. Stunned: The speed of Kyle's recovery - on both occasions - surprised staff at Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham (file picture) He had suffered a fractured skull and was taken to the intensive care unit of Queen’s Medical Centre in Nottingham. He stayed in a coma and was on life support for three days. Nicky says: 'I waited there and spoke to him. I was there every day and I only came home to get changed. They tried to wake him up from the coma but his body wasn’t ready for it so they put him back to sleep.' Kyle stayed on the ward for five days before being discharged. The recovery stunned medical staff and Nicky: 'We expected to be in the hospital for more than a month. He was there just over a week. They called him a miracle boy.' Struck down: Kyle returned to school after the bike accident, only to contract meningitis a year later . Omen? After the bike accident there was a heart-shaped bloodstain on Kyle's T-shirt . Kyle eventually returned to his life as a student at Noel-Baker Community School, where teachers gradually introduced him back into lessons. Nicky said: 'Noel-Baker were really good. They kept in contact with me on the phone to let me know how he was getting on. I was really nervous when he went back to school but Kyle just wanted to do what he always did and carry on as normal. He wouldn’t let anything stop him. 'We noticed after the accident that there was a heart-shaped bloodstain on the T-shirt he was wearing during the accident, just above where his heart is. We were so glad he was back at home and well again.' 'Like history repeating itself': Doctors told Kyle's mother Nicky, right, that her son was unlikely to recover from the meningitis . 'I'll stay out of trouble from now on': Kyle has returned to his studies at Noel Baker Community school and is trying to lead as normal a life as possible . But in August 2012 Kyle became unwell after staying at his sister’s house for a few days. Nicky says: 'I went round to check on him and he was struggling to walk and started feeling weaker. His eye, near to where he had fractured his skull the year before, started to get bigger and bigger. He started having seizures. We moved him but it was like lifting a dead weight. There was no movement in him whatever.' Once again, paramedics rushed Kyle to the Royal Derby Hospital. 'In the ambulance they said ‘you have a very poorly boy here. 'We went to the emergency room. They told me they thought it was meningitis. 'I asked them if I would lose him. They didn’t think he’d make it. It was like history repeating itself. 'A team from the Queen’s Medical Centre came to the Royal Derby to examine Kyle. They said he was really poorly and had to take him to the intensive care unit at the Queen’s Medical Centre. The staff there couldn’t believe he was back again.' Kyle was diagnosed with pneumococcal meningitis, which is rare in children of his age. It causes the membranes around the brain and spine to swell. Despite the severity of his condition, Kyle again amazed medics by being discharged from hospital just over a week later. 'The infection might have been caused by a hairline fracture still left in his skull from the BMX accident', speculates Nicky. Kyle is now back at school and leading as normal a life as possible. He said: 'When I first fell off my BMX my life flashed before my eyes. It went pitch black. I can’t remember anything. It was all black to me. 'I’ve promised my family I will stay out of trouble from now on.'","Kyle Reeve in a coma in June 2011 after breaking skull in BMX crash .

After the dramatic decision by Home Secretary Theresa May to block the computer hacker’s extradition to the US, the spotlight falls on Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer. Mr Starmer must now decide whether Mr McKinnon can be charged in this country. Prosecutors are being encouraged by the US to bring the 46-year-old to justice in the UK. Ready: Computer hacker Gary Mckinnon, pictured, with his mother Janis Sharp, is willing to stand trial in Britain, his family has said . Some supporters claim he has suffered enough already, by having spent ten years on bail, living under the shadow of extradition. But his mother, Janis Sharp, said: ‘Our ten-year battle was to stop Gary being sent to stand trial in the United States. We have always said we wanted him to face justice in a British court. If he is charged, so be it. ‘After what Gary and my family have been through this is almost the least of our worries. We will deal with it. We are just delighted and overjoyed that Mrs May blocked his extradition.’ Asperger’s sufferer Mr McKinnon – who faced up to 60 years in a US prison for hacking into Nasa and Pentagon computers looking for evidence of the existence of alien life – was yesterday coming to terms with his reprieve alongside his family and girlfriend Lucy Clarke. Mrs May stopped Mr McKinnon’s extradition on human rights grounds after medical reports showed he was very likely to try to kill himself if extradited. In the spotlight: Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer must now decide whether Mr McKinnon can be charged in this country . The decision – a huge victory for the Mail’s Affront to British Justice campaign – was applauded by MPs and civil liberties groups. It is the first time a Home Secretary has blocked an extradition to the US under the hugely controversial Extradition Act 2003. Mrs Sharp said yesterday: ‘This was the first morning we could wake up without this awful fear hanging over my family. Gary says he had forgotten what it feels like to be happy. ‘He’s still tense and it will take time but we now want to concentrate on helping Gary get his life back on to an even keel.’ The DPP provoked fury when he ruled in 2009 that there was ‘insufficient evidence’ for Mr McKinnon to be tried in Britain, even though Mr McKinnon admitted hacking into the US computers from the bedroom of his North London flat. If a UK prosecution does proceed, it would probably be under the Computer Misuse Act 1990, with a maximum sentence of five years. The US expressed anger at Mrs May’s unilateral decision to halt extradition. It raised questions about whether the Americans – who hold the bulk of the evidence against Mr McKinnon – would co-operate in the legal process. However, officials say the diplomatic fall-out has been limited. The US Department of Justice stressed: ‘Our extradition relationship with the United Kingdom remains strong, as is demonstrated by the extradition of five alleged terrorists from the United Kingdom just last week.’ David Cameron’s spokesman said the Prime Minister had not been in touch with the US authorities to discuss the McKinnon case. Mr McKinnon’s lawyer Karen Todner said last night of Tuesday’s decision: ‘I believe the decision was a courageous one but it was also both legally and morally correct. ‘The medical evidence that I supplied to the Home Secretary was overwhelming and extremely powerful. It would have been astounding for her to ignore it. ‘I do not believe that this case sets any precedents. The medical evidence in Mr McKinnon’s case was, in my view, unique. ‘I hope that Mr McKinnon and his family will now be able to enjoy a modicum of normal life after enduring ten very difficult years.’ Decision: Home Secretary Theresa May blocked the computer hacker's extradition to the US .","Computer hacker's extradition to the US was blocked by Theresa May .

"By . Amelia Proud . PUBLISHED: . 17:56 EST, 19 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 22:02 EST, 19 October 2012 . Lawyers for the defence in the Britney Spears trial are blaming . Britney's breakup with Justin Timberlake for the downward spiral that eventually saw her sectioned. A lawyer for Lynne Spears and Britney, who made opening . statements for the defence earlier today, says the end of this relationship with her childhood sweetheart was so painful that she changed almost overnight, according to TMZ. According to the lawyer, before they split, Britney . was a 'ray of light,' but afterwards she became 'angered and . depressed.' So happy: Britney Spears' break up with Justin Timberlake 'caused the downward spiral' that led to her being sectioned, her parents' lawyers claim . They also claimed that Lutfi would hide the singer's dog, wait for the tears to come and then 'find' the pup to appear as a 'saviour figure' to the star. They added that Britney's parents, especially her father Jamie, had made heroic efforts to help their daughter. Lawyers also mentioned that when Jamie tried to ask Lutfi to stay away from his daughter, the parent touched Lutfi's arm and is now being sued for assault. 'And at that point Jamie touched Lutfi. For that, Jamie is being sued for battery,' lawyer Leon Gladstone said. He said Lutfi was not hurt and was out that night with Britney. Spears attempted to put on a brave face as she faced on the world on Thursday afternoon while her ex manager made a series of bombshell claims about her in court at the same time. The 30-year-old looked tense and dishevelled as she stepped out in LA with a male companion wearing grimy tracksuit pants and a white T-shirt. Back in the fray: Britney Spears parents, Lynne and Jamie Spears arrive at court on Friday . Her former manager Sam Lutfi claimed she was once hooked on . prescription drugs, downing up to 30 a day, and was in such a grip of . addiction she shaved her head to beat a drugs test. Lutfi is suing Spears, her mother Lynne and father Jamie for defamation, breach of contract and libel. 'She liked to use amphetamines. Mostly everything that went wrong was because of this drug,' Lutfi's lawyer Joe Schleimer told the jury, alleging that Mr Lutfi was made a scapegoat for the singer's mental breakdown back in 2008. Schleimer told the jury that Spears had a 'prescription for amphetamines, and overdosed on them' before being put in the involuntary 5150 hold. Carrying on as normal: On Thursday, while Sam Lutfi gave evidence... Britney shopped and worked out as normal . Gym visit: The X Factor judge stopped in for a workout on Thursday as she tried to carry on as normal . Lutfi felt that Spears should not perform at the 2007 MTV Awards as she was still overweight and did not rehearse. However 'Britney wouldn't hear it.' The star's subsequent lacklustre performance at the ceremony was roundly criticised. Schleimer added that Lutfi was trying to help the singer but lost control in a series of events that led to her being hospitalised and placed under a court-ordered conservator. Lutfi is also seeking a share of the singer's fortunes, claiming he had an agreement to serve as her manager in exchange for 15 percent of her earnings. Schleimer conceded the case would be a complicated one. His opening statements included flashing photos of Spears with a shaved head and striking an SUV with an umbrella back in 2007 during a period of her life which he described as a 'complete shambles.' He said one of Lutfi's first actions after being hired as manager was having drug-sniffing dogs search the singer's hilltop home. He claimed Spears favoured . amphetamines and that the dogs turned up a substance the Grammy-award winner . told Lutfi was probably crystal meth. Turned sour: Lutfi, pictured with Spears in 2008, was once an integral part of the singer's camp but is now suing his former client and her parents for defamation and breach of contract . But Jurors are unlikely to hear directly . from the singer, who remains under a conservatorship overseen by a judge . who has ordered her not to appear for trial or a deposition. Superior Court Judge Susan Bruguera told Schleimer during a break in . proceedings that all the accusations he raised during his opening . statement should be supported by evidence to be presented at trial. Schleimer said he would prove them through either 'testimony or documentary evidence.' Attorneys for Spears' parents and conservators will have their own opportunity to present opening remarks to jurors. Lutfi and Spears' parents, Jamie and Lynne, were all in court as Schleimer made his opening statements to the panel of eight women and four men; Britney's parents took notes throughout. Jamie Spears did not look up at the photos of his daughter that Schleimer displayed. Lacklustre: Lutfi claims he did not want Spears taking part in the 2007 MTV awards but she 'wouldn't hear it' Lutfi is seeking millions of dollars from Spears and her family, claiming her mother's Lynne's 2008 book: Through the Storm: A Real Story of Fame and Family in a Tabloid World, lied about him drugging and isolating the pop superstar. He is also seeking a portion of the singer's profits, claiming he was a key player in her 2007 album Blackout and had the right to serve as her manager for years. The case is the culmination of years of acrimony between Lutfi and Spears' family and conservators, who successfully obtained a restraining order against him to keep him from contacting the singer or trying to intervene in her life. The order has expired, but conservatorship attorneys are seeking repayment for more than $93,000 in legal fees - a judgement Lutfi is appealing. Shaved head: Schleimer told the jury Britney had shaved her head to avoid a drugs test on her follicles . Lutfi sued back in February 2009, roughly a year after Spears was hospitalised and placed under the conservatorship to take control of her health and finances. The move by Jamie Spears came after months of erratic behaviour by his daughter, including shaving her head, speaking in a British accent and other bizarre incidents that also led to her losing custody of her two sons with ex-husband Kevin Federline. Lutfi was a constant presence around Spears during this tumultuous period of her life, her parents accused of him of crushing tablets into her food. It's also been claimed  that Britney was going broke during her time with Lufti. With no source of income, the star - who was worth $32 million - was spending $700 a month, paying huge legal bills in her custody case with ex-Kevin Federline and renting luxury mansions, one of which she spent just three nights in. In his court case he maintains that he was trying to help her, though her parents say Lutfi cut her phone line, hid her cellphones and used the paparazzi as 'henchmen.' He also said that Britney shaved her hair to avoid the courts finding drug residue - which can remain in the strands for months after use. Turned life around: Britney now has a role as a U.S. X Factor judge and plans to wed agent Jason Trawick . Schleimer claimed Lutfi befriended . the paparazzi so that they would treat Spears with more respect and . claims he tried to assemble top talent agents to jumpstart her career. 'Sam was trying to find top notch people to work with Britney,' he told the court. Lufti is also planning to call Lourdes Torres to testify that Britney is being controlled by her parents via the conservatorship. 'Lulu ended up quitting her job because she was so disturbed by what she saw was happening to Britney…Lulu’s testimony could have significant impact on the jury because she spent a great deal of time with Britney and her parents after the conservatorship was put in place. Lulu isn’t after money, she just wants the truth to come out and it will be shocking,' a source told Radar. Many of the claims about Lufti were included in court filings used to obtain the conservatorship, but Lynne Spears also included them in her book. Lutfi . is suing for libel based on three chapters in the book that describe . him as a 'general' to the paparazzi and portray him as a man trying to . manipulate not only the singer, but also her mother. Although she is still under conservatorship, Spears is now firmly back on track with a role as a judge on X Factor USA. She is also now preparing to . marry long-term love Jason Trawick. The case continues today.","Sam Lutfi would hide Britney's dog then 'find the pup to appear as a saviour figure'

But now Mr Dean, 56, from Lincolnshire, says he has finally had his spirits lifted after winning the Daily Mail’s Dream Cottage Competition.

He said he was ‘in absolute shock’ when . he received the call telling him he had won the 17th century cottage . worth £340,000 in Suffolk. He added: ‘I’m overwhelmed. At first I thought it was one of my friends pulling my leg. David Dean said he was in 'absolute shock' when he received the call saying he'd won the cottage . ‘If you believe in fate, this is certainly it. I feel it’s my reward for the difficult time I’ve had. ‘It has been a tough few years watching my father’s health slowly deteriorate, but this is some light at the end of the tunnel for me.

It has three bedrooms, all its original beams and fireplaces as well as a summer house and hot tub in the garden – vastly different from the small 1960s semi-detached house in Lincolnshire where he lived with his father. The cottage, appropriately named The Retreat, has a pretty garden with a rockery,  a partly walled terrace and a rose archway – a spot where Mr Dean can enjoy summer barbecues with his five brothers.","David Dean, 56, quit his factory job to care for his father in his final years .

A 15-year-old schoolgirl who was found dead on the tracks at London's St Pancras station had visited a website featuring self harm and anorexia, campaigners said today. They called for websites to be forced to remove content that glamorises suicide and self harm to help prevent any more deaths like that of the private school pupil from Hampstead. Tallulah was struck by a train on Sunday after posting messages on Twitter about killing herself. Shocking discovery: Tallulah Wilson, 15, was found dead on the tracks at St Pancras International station after she was struck by a train . She wrote 'I'm done' and added the hashtag '#suicide' in a tweet dedicated to 15-year-old Rosie Whitaker, who died in similar circumstances in Beckenham in July, after being bullied online. Tallulah, who had reportedly been bullied at her school, wrote: 'why the f*** should I stay if no one around me stay for . me? It’s not f***ing fair. I’m done. I’m f***ing done #suicide . #goodbye.' It was followed by another harrowing message last week that read: 'I don’t want to wake up anymore'. A family spokesman said: 'Tallulah . will always be remembered as a loving daughter and caring sister. She . was a clever, cheerful and creative girl with a talent for dance and . huge potential. She will be sadly missed by all those who knew her. 'The family now request the media leave them to grieve and respect their privacy.' Campaigners today called on the government and internet companies to do more to prevent young people accessing harmful websites. Sad tale: The schoolgirl had tweeted about being being unhappy shortly before she was found dead at St Pancras, pictured . Tallulah, who lived with her family in £1million Victorian terraced house in West Hampstead, was a pupil at £11,000-a-year St Margaret’s School. She started at the school in September after leaving St Marylebone School, where she had reportedly been bullied. Mark Webster, head of St Margaret’s School, said: 'Tallulah had only been with us for a few weeks but she was already a very popular member of our community, well-liked by literally all who knew her, teachers and staff alike. 'Her good-natured charm, kind manner and sweet sense of humour will be deeply missed. We feel for her family and are thinking of them at this very difficult time.' Elizabeth Phillips, head of St Marylebone School, did not comment on questions about bullying, but said: 'St Marylebone School offers pastoral care and counselling services to our pupils, rated excellent by Ofsted. That support is available at this time as it is throughout the year.' A spokeswoman for eating disorder . charity Beat said: 'Our heart goes out to Tallulah’s family at the loss . of such a young life. Pro-anorexia sites, although not directly a cause . of an eating disorder can be particularly dangerous in that they . encourage people to believe that eating disorders are a life style . choice and not the serious mental illness that they truly are. 'They also encourage people to avoid treatment. 'There . is no internationally enforceable legislation in this area and indeed . many of these sites are run by young people who are ill and we are not . sure what purpose it would serve to criminalise someone with a serious . mental illness.' Fresh start: Tallulah had reportedly been bullied at St Marylebone School, pictured, which she left last month to join £11,000-a-year St Margaret's . A spokeswoman for The Samaritans said: 'Samaritans agrees that certain types of suicide-related material online can be potentially dangerous when accessed by vulnerable individuals. 'It is important that organisations which run sites that are highly popular with young people develop responsible practices around suicide-related content, including promoting sources of support and by removing content which actively encourages or glorifies self harm or suicide. 'However, we also know that many people find emotional support by using online forums, blogs and social networking sites to discuss feelings of distress and despair and so the right balance has to be struck to make sure that legitimate online dialogue about suicidal feelings is not prohibited.' Emma-Jane Cross, CEO of BeatBullying said: 'We know from our research that young people are alarmed by the number of self-harm and suicide sites they encounter in their cyber lives and for young people who become engaged in these sites they can be incredibly damaging and have devastating consequences. 'Much is being done, by various organisations and children themselves, but the government and the internet industry must take the issue of keeping children safe online more seriously. It is clear that we cannot afford to wait any longer for this to happen.' Loved: The head of St Margaret's School in Hampstead said Tallulah 'was already a very popular member of our community', despite only having been at the school for a few weeks . Tallulah, nicknamed Toots, had sung in the junior choir at the parish church of St John in Hampstead, where news of her death was announced to worshippers at Evensong on Sunday. One churchgoer said: 'It’s very sad. She has two siblings and was well known at the church. There was even a CD produced not long ago with music from the choir. We weren’t told exactly what happened. It’s such a tragedy.' Tallulah’s friends expressed sadness about the loss of the 'beautiful' and 'loved' girl on Twitter, with many suggesting that bullying may have been a trigger for her death. One friend tweeted: 'Bullying is such a sick thing. RIP Tallulah.' Another wrote: 'Rip tallulah wilson - didn’t know you but everyone was crying at school today so you were loved.' Another said: 'Never really knew you, but you’ll never be forgotten! RIP Tallulah wilson, so young and left school cause of bully’s.' Jenny Stephen, headteacher of nearby South Hampstead High School, wrote to parents about Tallulah’s death because she had been friends with some pupils there. Ms Stephen wrote: 'A Year 11 girl at another school, who was friends with some girls at our school, committed suicide yesterday [Sunday]. This has obviously been an enormous shock to all the girls who knew her. 'I wanted to let you know so that you are aware your daughter may come home upset or be upset in the coming days.' She added: 'Our experience would tell us that Facebook will play a huge part in communicating between pupils their feelings. Of course, restricting access to Facebook and other social media sites is hard but the communication can happen 24/7 and can be quite difficult for the students to handle.' A British Transport Police spokesman said: 'BTP officers attended St Pancras International Railway Station on Sunday 14th October 2012 at around 1005 hours after a report that a person had been struck by a train. 'Officers from BTP attended the scene, which was reported to police at 1002 hours and this incident is currently being treated as non-suspicious. 'Paramedics from the London Ambulance Service also attended but sadly, a female was pronounced dead at the scene.'

David Cameron’s Fiat 500 which he bought as a surprise birthday present for his wife is up for sale and expected to fetch £10,000 at auction. The Prime Minister may have moved on to bigger and better cars than the small, humble Italian car, preferring to travel in the comfort of a chauffeur-driven Jaguar XJ, but back in 1998 the iconic Fiat was the present of choice for his wife Samantha Cameron. The couple kept the car for ten years, clocking just 1,000 miles around the Cotswolds. Memento for sale: This Fiat 500, which David Cameron owned for ten years, will go under the hammer in November and expected to fetch between £8,000 and £12,000 . This original right-hand drive Fiat 500 L was first registered on 20th August 1971 in Warwickshire and has covered what is believed to be a genuine 13,000 miles from new. It will be sold by Silverstones Auctions on November 17 at the Footman James Classic Motor Show at the NEC and is expected to fetch between £8,000 and £12,000 when it goes under the hammer. Nick Whale, managing director of the auction house said: ‘No matter what your political persuasion, this is one cool car and we are delighted to be able to offer it for auction at our sale in November as part of the Footman James Classic Motor Show weekend. Surprise present: Mr Cameron bought the car as a surprise birthday present for wife Samantha (pictured together today at the Conservative Party Conference) in 1998 . ‘After all, it’s not everyday that you get the chance to bid for a car that was once owned by a global figure.’ Will Smith, a specialist at the auction house, said: ‘It was bought as a birthday present and it really was a thoughtful gift. ‘The Fiat 500 is a trendle little car and would have been the perfect car for the Camerons to drive to the shops in. ‘It is in pristine condition and has been restored beautifully. Not only is it ideal as a weekend car but it is also perfect as a city run-around.’ Iconic car: Auctioneers said the car, first registered in 1971, is in pristine condition and will go on sale at the Footman James Classic Motor Show . Fiat built the 500 between 1957 and 1975 and it became one the most iconic and unmistakable cars of the 20th century. With a tiny 479 cc two-cylinder, air-cooled engine, the Fiat 500 characterised working class motoring in the past. The auction comes after Mr Cameron recounted a ‘terrible’ experience of having his Skoda stolen in a burglary. He recalled how raiders once burgled his home then escaped in his car, telling Sky: ‘I’ve been burgled a couple of times when I lived in London, in North Kensington. There was one occasion when I left the keys in my car and they loaded up my Skoda and drove off. It is a horrible feeling when your house has been invaded.’","David Cameron owned the Fiat 500 for ten years .

And it seems that 'dressing down' requires a lot more effort than meets the eye with a staggering 43 per cent spending more time on hair, makeup and grooming on a Friday compared to any other day of the working week, with 24 per cent choosing the day to experiment with their look. This experimentation, which adds an average of fifteen minutes to an individual’s morning routine, has also had an effect on our pockets as 50 per cent claim to spend more on their Friday fashion than they do for the remainder of the week. Mini-skirts have become a norm on dress down Friday as many people gear up for the night ahead and hit the town straight after work . And it seems that the office is increasingly becoming a catwalk with high heels over four inches, party dresses and mini skirts all seen as acceptable Friday attire, especially for the 50 per cent of those surveyed who claim to go straight out from work every week. With 15 per cent of men claiming to have pulled a colleague aside to tell them about a Friday fashion faux pas, and one in five women admitting to whispering at the water cooler behind a colleague’s back, it’s not surprising that more than one in ten of us have enlisted the advice of a professional stylist over what to wear to work. 'It's a dilemma that can be easily solved with a few individual items that can be mixed and matched to create that killer, day-to-night combo' says Very.co.uk ambassador Fearne Cotton . The study, carried out by leading online fashion retailer Very.co.uk, found that regionally, those in Birmingham and the West Midlands are the least confident in choosing their outfits alone, with 53 per cent of respondents asking partners, 38 per cent asking family members and nearly a quarter asking complete strangers for style advice. Brand ambassador for Very.co.uk Fearne Cotton said: 'We’ve all been there, rummaging through drawers and trying to find the outfit that makes you look fabulous without looking like you’ve tried too hard. 'It’s a dilemma that millions of us face every week that can be easily solved with a few individual items that can be mixed and matched to create that killer, day-to-night combo.' Julie Donnelly, head of womenswear buying at Very.co.uk added: 'The pressure to look good in the office has never been more intense, and with 51 per cent of people claiming to go straight out from work on a Friday, day-to-night fashion like our latest range of party dresses, is proving increasingly popular.'","Nearly one quarter have been late due to indecision over what to wear .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 13:24 EST, 21 January 2012 . These CCTV pictures showing millionaire City lawyer Francis Bridgeman drunkenly swaying through a train station helped show up a web of lies that ultimately led to him being jailed. Bridgeman, 43, was found guilty of perverting the course of justice for lying to detectives after he crashed his £50,000 Range Rover Sport into a telegraph pole. Rather than admit what had happened, he concocted a story that he hoped would preserve his reputation. Rocky road: CCTV footage showed Bridgeman stumbling along a platform just before he said he had been kidnapped . Problems: Bridgeman then appears to have some trouble negotiating a post at the tube station - and left, the disgraced lawyer at court . He told officers who breathalysed him three hours after the crash and found him to be over the limit, that he had been the victim of a kidnapping. However, Bridgeman’s story unravelled . when CCTV footage showed him weaving drunkenly along a train platform at . London Bridge Station after a post-work pub binge, where he drank five . pints of Guinness with a friend. Police launched a kidnap investigation after the Oxford-educated school governor claimed armed men had stolen the luxury car at knifepoint before taking him away in another vehicle. A jury in December decided that the story was an elaborate ruse to escape a drink-driving charge. Sentencing him for 12 months at Lewes Crown Court yesterday, Judge Guy Anthony said: ‘I doubt a drink-drive conviction would have led to this but any conviction of perverting the course of justice is serious.’ Quoting a line from Sir Walter Scott’s poem Marmion, he added: ‘Oh, What a tangled web we weave, When first we practise to deceive.’ A long walk home: Bridgeman walked for three hours back to his oasthouse in East Sussex . The lawyer drove his car off the road . on April 6 last year on his way home to the Grade-II listed, . £1.25million house he shares with his wife Maggie in Wadhurst, East . Sussex. The car snapped a telegraph pole in half and ended up 80 metres away in a field. But . instead of waiting for police to arrive, Bridgeman set off on foot . through the countryside for three hours to avoid a breath test. When . detectives eventually visited his home and found he was over the limit, . he said he had been kidnapped and claimed his attackers must have . crashed the car. He said: ‘I felt an arm around my throat with what felt like a knife. I was almost in tears and didn’t know what to do.’ (File picture) Bridgeman, 43, drunkenly crashed his £50,000 Range Rover Sport into a telegraph pole . Forensic officers found his DNA on the Range Rover’s airbag, showing that he must have been driving the car when it crashed. Prosecuting, Richard Barton said: ‘The sad truth is you started lying in order to get out of a possible drink-driving offence. ‘You thought that with your experience as a lawyer you would be able to talk your way out of trouble. That lie got bigger and bigger as you went on. 'Like jumping into a bramble bush, it got harder to get out of it the more you struggled.’ Bridgeman, who is a governor of The Skinner’s School in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, resigned from London law firm Macfarlanes in December where he was an equity partner. DC Emma Penrose-Reed, from East Sussex CID, said last night: ‘Francis Bridgeman tried to portray himself as a victim of crime and continually displayed acts of ill-health throughout the investigation. ‘But due to the hard work and close liaison with our valuable partners at British Transport Police, we were able to discredit his fabricated story and bring him to justice.’ Judge Guy Anthony jailed Bridgeman for 12 months and told Lewes Crown Court (pictured) the sentence would have been less if he hadn't spun his web of lies .","Francis Bridgeman jailed for a year for perverting the course of justice .

A hospital has been shut to patients after finding traces of the potentially deadly bacteria in its water system that can lead to Legionnaires’ Disease. St George’s Hospital, in Hornchurch, Essex, has closed its two wards containing 44 patients following the discovery of the bacteria during routine water testing. The decision was taken by North East London NHS Foundation Trust.No fresh admissions were being made today, but other services were staying open - subject to an ongoing review, a spokesman said. Legionnaire's bacteria was detected during water testing at St George¿s Hospital, in Hornchurch, Essex . Legionnaires’ disease is a type of pneumonia contracted by breathing in small droplets of water contaminated with legionella bacteria. It can be fatal if left untreated but isn't contagious. It obtained its name in 1976 after delegates at a conference being held by the American Legion in Philadelphia became ill with this strain of bacteria for the first time. Hospital chiefs insist it is not uncommon for testing to detect the bacteria and most people exposed do not go onto develop Legionnaires’ disease. The symptoms are mild headaches, muscle pain, fever, persistent cough and sometimes vomiting and diarrhoea. Legionella pneumophila under the microscope: The bacteria causes Legionnaires' disease, first named in 1976 . A statement from North East London NHS Foundation Trust said: 'During routine water testing at St George’s Hospital in Hornchurch, preliminary results show elevated levels of legionella bacteria in sections of the water system. 'To ensure the safety of patients at the hospital, NELFT has made the decision to move bed-based patients from the hospital. 'There are currently 44 patients in two wards at St George’s. Plans are being finalised to move patients to suitable accommodation later today. 'We are closed to inpatient admissions. Other services on site will remain open and are subject to ongoing review. Final test results are expected on Monday. 'It is not uncommon for routine testing to detect legionella bacteria. 'Legionella bacteria are widely distributed within the environment and can be found in artificial water sources such as water towers associated with cooling systems, domestic water systems and spa pools, and natural water sources such as rivers and streams. 'Most people exposed to the bacteria do not become ill with Legionnaires’ disease and the illness cannot be spread from person-to-person.'

"By . David Richards . UPDATED: . 08:08 EST, 29 December 2011 . The severe economic downturn is being blamed for the sudden closure of a 71-year-old independent school just days before the start of the new term. Governors waited until the day after Boxing Day to tell parents of pupils at £9,000-a-year St Michael’s School in Tawstock, North Devon, through letters and emails that it would not reopen next week. It is understood the school's 30 staff also learned of the news on Tuesday. The gradual decline in pupils from 300 ten years ago to 170 at the start of the term combined with the unexpected withdrawal of 10 pupils before the Christmas break forced the governors' hand. Set in 30 acres, St Michael's School (main white building) in Tawstock, Devon, looks down to the church further down the Taw Valley. The 71-year-old school stunned pupils and staff this week when it announced it had gone into administration . Some parents are believed to be attempting a rescue bid for the school . However some parents are believed to be attempting a rescue bid. One parent, a nurse from Bideford who wished to remain anonymous, said reading the e-mail was a huge shock. She said: 'I have three children at the school and the eldest joined two years ago. 'It was just such a great atmosphere. All the teachers knew the children’s names, it was like a big family. 'It is just devastating - friends with children at the school have already said ""Oh my God, what are we going to do?"" 'I don’t think the news has sunk in yet with the children.'The school was set up in 30 acres of parkland overlooking the Taw Valley during World War II for evacuated boys from Sussex. It caters for youngsters aged three months to 13 years. Mark Parkhouse, chairman of governors, wrote: 'It is with enormous regret that the governors of St Michael’s School have had to announce that, after 71 years at Tawstock, the school will not be reopening in January and has been placed into administration with immediate effect. 'The school’s closure will be a huge blow to staff, parents and especially the children, and we cannot emphasise enough our sadness at having to take this devastating decision. 'Falling numbers, due in large measure to the severe economic downturn, have played a substantial part in the school’s decline.' The decision to close came just a month after the school’s latest visit from the Independent School’s Inspectorate, which gave it a glowing report. Inspectors said: 'A purposeful and enjoyable learning environment is evident throughout the school.' A study in September revealed that nearly a third of parents who pay for private education are thinking twice about sending children to independent schools or slashing the amount of money they spend. It emerged that up to 500,000 families would consider educating one child privately while sending other siblings to state schools. The Schroders bank survey found that changes in the way money is spent on private education could leave a swathe of independent schools vulnerable to closure as parents search for more competitive alternatives. On the St Michael's official Facebook page a statement said: 'The governors have made the very difficult decision today to pass the school over to receivers.' It added 'some current parents are trying to make a final attempt to save it, if you would be interested in helping please get in touch'. A meeting is due to take place today for parents where schools allocation for the pupils’ will be discussed. Representatives from other private schools in North Devon and from the local education authority will attend to help with preparations. Former headmaster Bill Pratt, who also heard the news of the closure on Tuesday, said: 'We have been waiting for it to happen. 'The rapid decline in pupils in the last couple of years has been noticeable but that doesn’t mean it is any less of a shock. 'A lot of people will be very sad, including myself.' On the unofficial 'Friends of St Michael’s School Tawstock' Facebook page parents and former pupils expressed shock and sadness as the news emerged. One said: 'I can’t believe it. It always seemed such a solid fixture in our lives.' Until the 1970s the school, formerly Tawstock Court, catered for boys aged up to 13 and provided boarding. Later it opened admissions to girls. Boarding came to an end in 2000 and it was after this the nursery was set up which cared for children as young as three months.","'It is just devastating - friends with children at the school have already said ""Oh my God, what are we going to do?""

Killer: Christopher Halliwell's ex-girlfriend has told how they had sex hours after he murdered 22-year-old Sian O'Callaghan . The former lover of killer Christopher Halliwell has revealed how they had sex just hours after the taxi-driver assaulted and murdered office worker Sian O'Callaghan. Heather Widdowson was unaware when she got into bed with her 48-year-old partner that he had abducted and stabbed 22-year-old Sian while out driving his cab in Swindon in the early hours of that same morning. 'He took me to bed that afternoon just hours after he killed her,' the 55-year-old said, as she described her revulsion at discovering what 'sick' Halliwell had done. 'I don't know how he managed to keep his feelings to himself but I remember he was laughing and joking,' she said. Ms Widdowson also told The Sun the divorced father-of-three text her to tell her he loved her shortly before he carried out his brutal attack on Miss O'Callaghan in March last year. The office worker was making her way back to the home she shared with her boyfriend after leaving Swindon's Suju nightclub when she got into Halliwell's green Toyota Avensis taxi. Instead of taking her home, the killer drove Miss O'Callaghan to nearby Savernake Forest where he sexually assaulted and killed her. The taxi-driver was jailed for life for her murder at Bristol Crown Court on Friday. Ms Widdowson told how, the morning after the savage attack, her then partner awoke unusually early and told her he had 'a lot to do', before taking his cab to a car wash. She now knows Halliwell's early-morning errand was an attempt to cover up his horrific crime. The cab driver also moved Miss O'Callaghan's body to a location in Uffington, Oxfordshire. He eventually led police to her remains following his arrest on March 24 2011. Victims: Halliwell has been jailed for life for the murder of Sian O'Callaghan, left, but a second charge over the death of Becky Godden-Edwards, right, was withdrawn due to a breach of police protocol . Halliwell's ex-wife Lisa, a nurse, has told how the killer collected his teenage son in his taxi the day after his attack on Miss O'Callaghan. Halliwell seemed 'completely normal' the day after the attack, according to his then girlfriend Heather Widdowson . She said the 48-year-old, who will serve at least 25 years in prison, has sent a grovelling letter to his family begging their forgiveness. Ms Widdowson, who met Halliwell in 2003 and moved in with him following his split from his ex-wife, told how he put posters of missing Sian up in the cab he used to abduct her as police searched for the 22-year-old following her disappearance. Halliwell's former partner said he grew ashen-faced when asked to give a DNA sample by police who were interviewing local taxi drivers as a routine part of their investigation. He was arrested on March 24. To Ms Widdowson's horror, she learned the taxi driver also led police to the remains of another victim, Becky Godden-Edwards. She had been dead for at least six years. It has now emerged that Halliwell could now face questioning over a string of unsolved killings. 'In all the years I'd been with Chris, he was hiding this sick secret,' his ex-partner said. Sentencing Halliwell to a minimum of 25 years for Miss O'Callaghan's murder, Mrs Laura Justice Cox DBE said he had abused his position as a taxi driver. 'There was here a prolonged period of time in which she would have suffered extreme fear and terror as well as severe pain from the injuries you inflicted upon her,' the judge said. Investigation: Police officers are seen searching a wooded area near Uffington, Oxfordshire, where Sian O'Callaghan's body was found . In an emotional statement outside the court, Miss O’Callaghan’s mother Elaine said: ‘There is never total closure, just accepting my life has changed for ever. I am just a mother who wants her daughter back.’ While the sentencing would not bring her daughter back, it would mean Halliwell could not take any more, she said. Grief: Sian O'Callaghan's mother Elaine made an emotional statement outside court following Halliwell's sentencing, flanked by her partner Pete Shawe (left), son Liam (right), and daugher Lora (far right) Karen Edwards, the distraught mother of Becky Godden-Edwards, was also at the hearing on Friday. But Halliwell escaped justice over the charge related to Miss Godden-Edwards death after a judge ruled his legal rights had been breached by detectives during the course of their investigations. The outcome was slammed by Karen Edwards, who said: 'What is wrong with this country when Halliwell's rights are more important than ours? 'He led police to my daughter's body, but he can't be tried for her murder? It doesn't make any sense,' she said. 'All we want is justice for Becky.' A heroin addict since the age of 16, troubled Becky left home on December 17 2002, promising her mother she would return when she was clean. But police arrived at her mother's door in April last year- on what would have been Becky's 29th birthday - to tell her that her daughter's remains had been found in a shallow grave in a field.

Devious: Shop worker Farrakh Nizzar told an elderly couple their winning £1million lottery ticket was worthless before trying to claim the prize for himself . A shop worker nicknamed 'Lucky' who tried to trick an elderly couple out of their winning £1million lottery ticket has been jailed for 30 months. Farrakh Nizzar, 30, told Maureen Holt her EuroMillions ticket was worthless before asking if she wanted the ticket back. Mrs Holt, 78, and her husband Fred, 80, who knew Nizzar by his nickname told him to bin the ticket. But unbeknown to them, when Nizzar had scanned the ticket at his cousin’s Best One shop in Oldham, Greater Manchester, where he worked, a message had flashed up advising the holder to contact Camelot. Nizzar, . who was due to be deported to Pakistan before the incident, lied to the . Holts and kept the ticket for himself. He later called the lottery . company himself in an attempt to keep the prize. But the firm became suspicious when he was unable to answer questions about the winning ticket. Camelot . checked CCTV and traced the rightful owners of the ticket using Mr . Holt’s Tesco Clubcard to unite the couple with their £1million prize. Nizzar pleaded guilty last month to one charge of fraud by false representation committed on May 31 this year. He bowed his head and made no reaction as he was jailed at Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester. Passing sentence, Recorder Philip . Cattan told the defendant: 'This goes to the heart of public confidence . in the National Lottery. 'The courts must demonstrate to you and to others that this type of fraud will be met by significant custody.' Back to its rightful owner: Nizzar had told Maureen Holt, 77, and her husband Fred, 80, that her EuroMillions ticket was worthless when she popped into her local corner shop to check if she had won a prize . Duncan . Wilcock, prosecuting, told the court that on June 21 this year, Mrs . Holt and her husband, a retired Royal Navy engineer, had bought the . EuroMillions ticket from a Tesco Extra in Oldham. The couple then went to Spain to celebrate Mr Holt's 80th birthday. On their return  Mrs Holt went to Best One to check the ticket. After being told it was worthless, Mrs Holt had purchased more tickets for the next draw, left the shop and 'thought no more about it,' Mr Wilcock sai, adding that Mrs Holt had thought Nizzar 'a really nice man, nice in all ways'. Lies: But in fact when Nizzar had scanned the winning ticket at his cousin's Best One shop in Oldham, Greater Manchester, where he worked, a message had flashed up advising the holder to contact Camelot . Checks: Camelot became suspicious about Nizzar's claims and checked Mr Holt's Tesco Clubcard . records to see that he had in fact bought the ticket at his local branch of Tesco extra in Oldham . When Camelot became suspicious and confronted Nizzar with the CCTV evidence he had 'looked at the floor for some time' but had claimed it was his ticket and blamed his 'bad . memory,' Mr Wilcock told the court. He was arrested by police on July 29 and pleaded guilty at . Oldham Magistrates' Court last month. Speaking from their home in Oldham, . Mr and Mrs Holt, who have suffered sleepless nights because of the . ordeal, said they were glad justice had been done. In a statement the new millionaires said: 'We are glad that justice has been done and that this matter is now behind us. Finally celebrating: The new millionaires said they had suffered sleepless nights over the ordeal but were now looking forward to enjoying their lottery win . 'We can now look forward to enjoying our lottery win and spending some time with our family and friends. We understand the defendant has written a letter to us and we look forward to reading this.' Carolyn Smith, mitigating, said Nizzar came to the UK in 2007 on a student visa and completed a postgraduate diploma in business studies. But when his student visa ran out, he was refused leave to remain in the UK and exhausted all his rights to appeal. Waiting for an apology: The court heard that Nizzar had written the Holts a letter, which the couple said they were looking forward to reading . As an 'over-stayer' he had no rights to work or claim benefits and was faced with 'irresistible temptation' to claim the winning ticket himself. He has since written a letter of apology to Mr and Mrs Holt, the court was told. Miss Smith added: 'This offence was the very definition of opportunistic. When the machine indicated the ticket holder should contact Camelot he would have realised that was a winning ticket for a significant amount. 'Clearly this was a split second decision to keep it and tell Mrs Holt she had not won.' A spokesperson from Camelot said: 'We . have stringent operations in place to prevent and detect fraud and to . monitor suspicious activity. Indeed, . the robustness of our investigation and the strength of evidence we . provided in the case of Farrakh Nizzar resulted in him pleading guilty . to the charge he faced.

One of the longest standing mysteries of migration has finally been solved after scientists discovered where the UK's Painted Lady butterflies go each autumn. The large, colourful butterflies, commonly seen in the UK countryside, migrates to our shores in varying numbers from the continent each summer. But until now scientists had no idea whether the Painted Lady made the return journey at the end of summer, like the closely related Red Admiral, or simply died in the UK. Long distance traveller: A Painted Lady butterfly sits atop lilac flowers. A new study of their migration habits has finally solved the mystery of where they disappear to each winter . Thanks to a massive survey of the creatures' habits, it has now been revealed that they make an epic intergenerational journey each year spanning thousands of miles from Africa to the Arctic and back again. In one of the largest citizen science projects ever conducted, scientists from Butterfly Conservation, the NERC Centre for Ecology & Hydrology and Rothamsted Research amongst others, discovered exactly what happens to Painted Ladies each autumn. More than 60,000 public sightings of . the butterfly were collected across Europe during 2009, with 10,000 . British observers taking part. Painted Lady on an Oxeye daisy: The creatures undertake a huge migration from Africa to the Arctic that takes them six generations to complete . Scientists also used radar to track their . movements across southern England. They discovered that the Painted Lady did indeed migrate south each autumn but made this return journey at high altitude out of view of butterfly observers on the ground. Radar records revealed that Painted Ladies fly at an average altitude of over 500m (1,640ft) on their southbound trip and can clock up speeds of up to 30mph by selecting favourable conditions. The findings also revealed that the species undertakes a phenomenal 9,000 mile round trip from tropical Africa to the Arctic Circle. That's almost double the length of the famous migrations undertaken by Monarch butterflies in North America. The whole journey is not undertaken by individual butterflies but is a series of steps by up to six successive generations. Painted Ladies returning to Africa in the autumn are thus several generations removed from their ancestors who left Africa earlier in the year. The UK's first major study of 'flying ant day' has revealed not one but two flying ant days, and indeed large numbers of ants were reported over two flying ant weeks. When the UK’s garden ants took to the air this summer, the Society of Biology received over 6,000 reports from members of the public as part of its first flying ant survey. About one-in-five sightings happened on Tuesday 24th July, and another one in five came two weeks later on Wednesday 8th August. These peaks were extremely striking, but still these two flying ant days accounted for fewer than half of the records. In fact, flying ants were a common sight for the days in July and August around the two peaks. The time between the two peaks was a period of low pressure, which is usually associated with clouds, wind and rain. This suggests that the weather had a large role to play in determining when the ants flew. Professor Adam Hart, an ecologist at the University of Gloucestershire, said: 'We found a relationship between flying ant swarms and weather conditions, which we expected, and geographical variation, which we didn’t expect.' Richard Fox, Surveys Manager at Butterfly Conservation, was one of the report authors. He said: 'The extent of the annual journey undertaken by the Painted Lady butterfly is astonishing. 'This tiny creature weighing less than a gram, with a brain the size of a pin head and no opportunity to learn from older, experienced individuals, undertakes an epic intercontinental migration in order to find plants for its caterpillars to eat. 'Once thought to be blindly led, at the mercy of the wind, into an evolutionary dead end in the lethal British winter, this amazing combination of mass-participation citizen science and cutting edge technology has shown Painted Ladies to be sophisticated travellers. 'We are extremely grateful to the many thousands of members of the public who reported Painted Lady sightings and contributed to this extraordinary discovery.' Radar in Hampshire operated by Rothamsted Research revealed that around 11million high-flying Painted Ladies entered the UK in spring 2009 with 26 million departing in autumn. Dr Jason Chapman, a researcher at Rothamsted Research, who led the radar studies of Painted Ladies, said: 'The apparent lack of a return migration of the late-summer generation of Painted Lady butterflies was one of the greatest enigmas in insect migration ecology. 'But, through a combination of traditional monitoring by butterfly enthusiasts and new radar techniques, we have finally solved this long-standing puzzle. 'Migrant insects continue to amaze the public and research community alike as they are capable of carrying out the most remarkable journeys.'","The large, colourful butterflies migrate to UK each summer, but until now no-one knew where they disappeared to .

A teenager has made a miracle recovery - after he had a massive heart attack that left him technically dead for seven minutes - before being saved by his teacher. Dan Edwards, 17, from  Worcester, collapsed after running up stairs at college - while rushing to get to a hospital appointment. The teenager was technically 'dead' as his heart stopped beating for seven minutes. Back at home: Dan is now recovering with his family, including mum Sue (left) sister Megan and dad Darren (right) But thanks to the quick thinking of his tutor, who started CPR, he has made a miraculous recovery. Tutor Matt Harwood desperately battled to keep him alive after calling paramedics - but after realising he had no heartbeat for more than seven minutes, feared the worst. After arriving at hospital, doctors warned his terrified parents, Sue and Darren, that they didn't know whether their sporty son would pull through - and if he did, feared he would be severely brain damaged. Lucky: Doctors had suspected Dan had issues with his heart . But less than a month after his brush with death, Dan has stunned medics by making an amazing recovery - and is now recovering at home in Worcester. His mum, Sue, 40, an NHS administrator, said: 'We are so grateful to everyone who has helped Dan pull through - we can't thank them enough. 'We came so close to losing our son, we're just so grateful that so many people knew basic first aid, and for everything the doctors have done for him. 'Even after Dan's heart had been restarted, the doctors told us they didn't know if he'd make it through the night. 'We were distraught - just a few hours before our healthy and happy son had been heading off to college on his moped, and now we were being told we might lose him forever. 'It was devastating. Once his heart had been stabilised, they still said that he might have suffered bad brain damage because his heart had been stopped for so long. 'We were told it would take a long time for him to properly wake up - but a few days later, Dan was sitting up in bed laughing and joking. 'Even the nurses in the hospital told us it was a miracle - he was really one of the lucky ones.'Engineering student Dan had been due to attend a hospital appointment for tests after doctors told him they suspected he might have issues with his heart. But after running up a flight of stairs at the Worcester College of Technology, to grab his coat, the teen suffered a cardiac arrest and collapsed, on September 28. Fortunately, one of his tutors, engineering manager Matt Harwood, heard him fall - and despite initially thinking that Dan had fainted and put him in the recovery position - but quickly realised he had no pulse and began CPR. He was joined by colleagues, including community first responder David Price, who took over the CPR, until paramedics arrived and restarted his heart with a defibrillator. Dan, who collapsed on the top floor of the Cathedral Building at about 10.30am on Friday, September 28, said: 'I can't remember much about what happened. 'I felt like I was in a swimming pool and I had fallen asleep. 'I could hear the faint voices of the paramedics calling my name, but I didn't know where I was. 'I'm so thankful to the people who saved me - it hasn't really sunk in yet how serious it was.' Dan's parents were already at Worcester Hospital, waiting for Dan to arrive for his appointment when they got a call from the college to say their son was being rushed in. Sue said: 'We were completely panicked - it didn't seem real when they said Dan had collapsed and was in an ambulance. 'We feared the worst, and seeing him in intensive care was devastating. 'The doctors told us they didn't know if he would pull through - they said he was very very sick. 'He was being kept alive by machines and was in a coma. 'They said it would take a long time for him to wake up, but four days after it happened, he was alert and awake. 'The nurses said there's not many people lucky enough to survive what he did - and they said it's a miracle he recovered as quickly as he did."" Healing: The teenager has now had a pacemaker fitted. The device is roughly the same size as a matchbox . Matt said: 'We knew that Dan's life was in the balance, so we all worked as hard as we could to save Dan. 'The paramedics were first class and reassured us we did the correct thing and that our reaction had given him a fighting chance. 'I think someone must have been looking down on him.' Dan, who was diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, has now been fitted with a cardioverter defibrillator to regulate his heartbeat. The device, slightly larger than a matchbox, monitors the heart rhythm and can deliver low-voltage electrical impulses to keep the heart beating correctly and larger shocks if needed. Dad Darren, who works in manufacturing, said: 'We are so grateful to the staff at the college, and especially to Matt, who realised what had happened and sprung into action so quickly. 'We want to share Dan's story to encourage people to consider learning basic first aid - it's so simple that anyone could do it, but all of Dan's friends have said that if he'd collapsed in front of them, they wouldn't know what to do. 'I can't thank the staff at the school enough for saving my son's life - there's no way we can repay them.'","Dan Edwards was rushing up stairs at college while trying to get to another hospital appointment on time .

"Emails from reporter Liz MacKean to friend expressing concerns about management . interference 'blocked by Panorama from appearing in show' By . Emily Allen . PUBLISHED: . 02:41 EST, 23 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:08 EST, 23 October 2012 . Calls: Harriet Harman, Labour's shadow culture . secretary, called for an independent inquiry . into the BBC's handling of the allegations . BBC boss George Entwistle will be quizzed about the handling of the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal by MPs today as calls were made for an independent inquiry into the Corporation's actions. Harriet Harman, Labour's shadow culture secretary, called on the Government to set up an independent inquiry into the BBC's handling of the allegations surrounding the late DJ. It comes after excerpts from last night's Panorama highlighted the different explanations given by BBC . bosses about a Newsnight documentary, which planned to expose Savile's crimes, and reasons why it was dropped. Mr Entwistle faces the Culture, . Media and Sport select committee a day after Newsnight editor Peter . Rippon stepped aside after the BBC said his explanation of why the show . dropped its investigation was 'inaccurate or incomplete'. In a statement last night Ms Harman said: 'With every day, new information comes to light of the pervasive and appalling nature of Jimmy Savile's sexual assaults. 'Tonight's Panorama programme means that the BBC will have to answer more questions about who knew what and when; and why the Savile tribute programmes were aired while the Newsnight investigation was axed. 'This will be a very distressing time for the many victims of Jimmy Savile and they will understandably want an independent inquiry which gets to the truth about what happened - not just at the BBC but at the other places where he committed these terrible crimes. 'It is not good enough for the government to leave the BBC - and other institutions - to investigate themselves in such a serious scandal. 'All this underlines the need for the Government to establish an overarching inquiry and for it to be truly independent.' This morning's select committee is expected to quiz Director-General Mr Entwistle, who took up his post last month, about the two reviews into the case set up by the BBC, the corporations vetting procedures at the time it employed the late DJ and its existing policies on sexual harassment. Questions: BBC director-general George Entwistle leaves his home in south London this morning ahead of being questioned by MPs, and right, Peter Rippon, editor of Newsnight who stood aside from his role yesterday . Mr Rippon has handed over control of the flagship current affairs show while the inquiry headed by Nick Pollard, the former head of Sky News, into how the BBC handled the scandal is carried out. Earlier this month, he defended his decision to axe the report in a BBC blog but yesterday the corporation issued a correction. He originally said there was no evidence staff at the Duncroft approved school in Surrey, which Savile regularly visited, could have known about allegations Savile abused children, but the BBC said: 'In fact some allegations were made (mostly in general terms) that some of the Duncroft staff knew or may have known about the abuse.' Mr Rippon also said the women who spoke to Newsnight journalists had already spoken to police, but the BBC now says that is untrue and Newsnight actually uncovered new evidence about Savile's alleged crimes. When BBC director-general George Entwistle appears before the Culture, Media and Sport select committee today there are key questions that must be asked if the truth is to emerge about why the Newsnight investigation into Jimmy Savile was dropped. The corrected blogpost also said that while no allegations were made BBC staff 'were aware' of Savile's behaviour, Newsnight did hear allegations of 'abusive conduct on BBC premises'. A BBC spokesman said: 'On the basis of material now available, it is apparent from information supplied by the Newsnight editor and programme team that the explanation by the editor in his blog of his decision to drop the programme's investigation is inaccurate or incomplete in some respects.' After Newsnight shelved the programme Entwistle wrote to all staff saying the investigation was into 'Surrey Police's inquiry into Jimmy Savile towards the end of 2011'. But producer Meirion Jones immediately emailed Mr Entwistle countering that, writing: 'George - one note - the investigation was into whether Jimmy Savile was a paedophile - I know because it was my investigation. 'We didn't know that Surrey Police had investigated Jimmy Savile - no-one did - that was what we found when we investigated and interviewed his victims.' Mr Entwistle will also face questions about a reported conversation he had with BBC director of news Helen Boaden who told him - in his then role of director of vision - about the Newsnight investigation and its possible impact on planned tributes to Savile during an awards lunch on December 2. She told him if the Newsnight investigation went ahead, he might have to change the Christmas schedules. Last night's Panorama heard from Mr Jones and reporter Liz MacKean who both claim they interviewed at least four alleged victims of Savile - and confirmed with Surrey Police they had investigated sex abuse complaints against the Jim'll Fix It star in 2007. They say when they told bosses the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) did not charge Savile because of insufficient evidence, they were told to end the investigation - and the show was withdrawn. Abuse: After Newsnight shelved the programme . Entwistle wrote to all staff saying the investigation was into 'Surrey . Police's inquiry into Jimmy Savile towards the end of 2011' - and not the allegations of paedophilia . Last night it emerged that Surrey Police had found evidence of 'three further potential offences' by Savile as a result of its investigation. Daily Telegraph's Neil Midgley: 'So Panorama was a programme that left open more questions than it answered. 'We still weren’t given a convincing . explanation as to why Rippon decided to pull the Newsnight investigation . at all – and, in particular, to pull it completely, instead of allowing . it to gather more evidence.' Guardian's Mark Damazer: . 'The noble reason for this acute and sometimes embarrassing navel- . gazing is the need to protect the BBC's impartiality and integrity'. Piers Morgan ‏@piersmorgan: 'This #Panorama expose of Savile is absolutely horrifying. Which makes it all the more scandalous that Newsnight covered it up.' Bianca Jagger ‏@BiancaJagger: 'I am watching #Panorama about #JimmySavile, I am speechless, shocked and revolted by the cover-up. We must expose other celebrities... Phillip Schofield ‏@Schofe: 'What a shame Peter Rippon chose not to talk to Panorama. #BBC #Panorama . Labour MP Tom Watson ‏@tom_watson: 'Can't believe #Panorama. If I was the BBC's impressive Liz MacKean or Meirion Jones I would be furious. What do you think?' But a CPS spokeswoman said charges were not brought because in each case 'the evidence showed that none of the alleged victims would support a prosecution'. The horror stories about Savile emerged only after ITV broadcast a documentary at the start of this month - sparking mayhem at the BBC over losing its scoop and leading to the allegations of a cover-up. A Panorama statement said: 'Peter Rippon has always maintained the story was pulled for 'editorial reasons' and not because of a potentially embarrassing clash with planned BBC tributes to Savile over Christmas. 'Panorama has found no evidence to contradict that view.' Mr Jones and Ms MacKean told . programme-makers bosses wanted them to stand up a suggestion Savile was . not prosecuted because the Crown Prosecution Service thought he was too . old and frail. When it . emerged that was not true and he was not prosecuted because of . insufficient evidence, the pair were told to abandon the investigation . rather than get more proof, Panorama reports. Ms . MacKean said: 'Ever since the decision was taken to shelve our story, . I've not been happy with public statements made by the BBC. 'I think they're very misleading about the nature of the investigation we were doing.' Ms MacKean said Mr Rippon went cold on . the story and she was left with the clear impression her editor was . feeling under pressure, writing to a friend: 'PR (Peter Rippon) says if . the bosses aren't happy... (he) can't go to the wall on this one.' Controversial: Last night's . edition of Panorama highlighted the different explanations given by BBC . bosses about a Newsnight documentary, which planned to expose Savile's crimes, and reasons why it was dropped . Reporter: Liz MacKean, a Newsnight reporter, said in the programme last night that she has 'not been happy with public statements made by the BBC' since they decided to shelve their Jimmy Savile story . Ms . MacKean told Panorama: 'I was very unhappy the story didn't run because . I felt we'd spoken to people who collectively deserved to be heard and . they weren't heard and I thought that was a failing... I felt very much . that I'd let them down.' Mr Jones emailed Mr Rippon five days later to warn him about what would happen if the investigation was dropped. 'I was sure the story would come out . one way or another and that, if it did, the BBC would be accused of a . cover-up,' Mr Jones tells Panorama. 'In . fact, I wrote an email to Peter saying 'the story is strong enough' and . the danger of not running it is 'substantial damage to BBC . reputation'.' Traumatic: Karin Ward, one of Savile's victims of child abuse, gave an interview to Newsnight 11 months ago while she was suffering from cancer. She spoke out in last night's Panorama over the scandal . Footage of Savile surrounded by girls was aired on last night's show entitled What The BBC Knew . More footage of Savile on one of his many shows lifting up the skirt of one female member of the audience . According to The Daily Telegraph three emails sent by Ms MacKean expressing concerns about management interference to an unnamed friend were blocked by Panorama's lawyers from appearing in last night's programme. The newspaper claimed that publication was prevented because of the potential for legal action.

"By . Jill Reilly . UPDATED: . 04:10 EST, 27 February 2012 . A New Zealand scientist is spending thousands of dollars on a study of zebrafish in an effort to find out why some females are attracted to older males. It it hoped the results could reveal why Catherine Zeta Jones fell for Michael Douglas with a 25 year age gap, explain the attraction between Prince Albert II of Monaco and his new wife who is 20 years younger than him and how Tom Cruise snared Katie Holmes when he is 16 years older than her. Research fellow Dr Sheri Johnson at Otago University, New Zealand is putting a $345,000 (£220,000) grant towards finding out, using 700 zebrafish, reported Stuff.co.nz. Age old question: A New Zealand scientist is preparing to spend thousands of dollars on a study of zebrafish to find out why females prefer older males . Famous age gap: It it hoped the results could reveal how Tom Cruise snared Katie Holmes when he is 16 years older than her and why . Catherine Zeta Jones fell for Michael Douglas with a 25 year age gap . For years many people have argued a . female tendency to be attracted to older males, goes against evolution . as older men have a decline in sperm function and the chance of a birth . defect also increases with age. Zebrafish . have been selected because they fertilise their eggs externally, making . the process easier to mimic, according to the scientist. Explanation: There is a 20 year age gap between Prince Albert II of Monaco and Princess Charlene who married last summer in Monaco . Aside from ethical issues, Dr Johnson . said trying to run the study in humans and controlling all of the . variables would be too difficult. Research fellow Dr Sheri Johnson at Otago University hopes she will find out the answer with the help of 700 zebrafish . She . cites one human study which was a cross-cultural comparison . done in the 1980 and the results indicated that women's preference for . older men was related to their tendency to have accumulated more . attractive resources called 'resource acquisition.' Dr Johnson says that seems a relatively obvious attraction and even makes evolutionary sense in terms of safety and protection. 'But if a woman was coming to the end of her fertility window and she wanted to get pregnant and needed a sperm donor, she would definitely choose a young male over an older one, right?' she told Stuff.co.nz. She says studies show a marked differences in semen volume, sperm motility and morphology in men in their thirties and fifties, which means they should be less attractive to women looking to have a child. Increasing male age has also been linked to a number of medical complications, such as miscarriage and higher rates of autism and Down's Syndrome according to Dr Johnson. But the number of men between 35 and 49 years old fathering children had increased in the past few decades, reports Stuff.co.nz. John Peek, group manager of Fertility Associates, said a man's age did increase the chance of a cell disorder, but not as much as a woman's age. 'Jumping 30 years in the male's age – from 20 to 50 – might be the equivalent of jumping two or three years in a woman in her late 30s,' he said. Mr Peek said said Dr Johnson's study could be very useful as current knowledge was based on indirect evidence and small samples sizes. 'There's going to be a bit of a difference between tiny little fish and people but it's a lot clearer if you know what the basics are and you can say `OK, what might be different between zebrafish and humans?' rather than saying we don't actually know the fundamentals at all.'","Otago University is putting a $345,000 grant towards finding some answers using 700 zebrafish .

"By . Simon Walters and Brendan Carlin . UPDATED: . 19:13 EST, 28 January 2012 . Kitchen cabinet: Ed Balls (pictured) and his wife, Yvette Cooper, have been wining and dining political allies . Ed Balls and Yvette Cooper were last night accused of a ‘lasagne-gate’ dinner party plot to undermine Labour leader Ed Miliband. The husband-and-wife Labour frontbench duo have each been tipped to succeed the embattled party leader if he is forced to resign before the next Election. They have been wining and dining hand-picked Labour MPs at their London home and in Westminster. The couple say that the events are merely intended to boost the party’s morale. But critics have accused them of disloyalty, claiming that they are attempting to build up their own power base ready to make a leadership challenge. At a gathering over New Year at their North London home, Mr Balls cooked lasagne for more than 30 of their closest political allies and afterwards the couple’s children performed a party piece. When a guest cheerily observed to one of the children, ‘Well done! You would clearly make a great leader of the Labour Party,’ the youngster replied: ‘No, my mummy is going to get that job.’ The Balls-Cooper charm offensive has not gone unnoticed by allies of Ed Miliband’s brother, David, who remains determined to avenge his defeat in the contest for the Labour leadership in 2010. Blairite David is a long-standing personal and political foe of the Brownite Mr Balls. A source close to the former Foreign Secretary said: ‘The Balls-Coopers are like the Borgias. They invite you round to lunch, then pour poison in your ear.’ Mr Balls also reportedly discussed Ed Miliband’s future at a separate dinner he had with a fellow senior Shadow Minister. Labour Lasagne-eater to Balls Minor: . Balls Minor: . According to one account, Mr Balls, the Shadow Chancellor, asked the dinner guest if they thought  the Labour leader would survive. Worried about falling into the trap of saying something disloyal, the guest declined to answer. The ‘lasagne-gate’ affair comes after a series of polls showed support for Ed Miliband falling away badly, even among Labour voters. Power couple: Balls and Cooper's charm offensive has not gone unnoticed by Ed Miliband's brother, David, who still harbours leadership ambitions himself . Mr Balls and Ms Cooper, Shadow Home Secretary, are understood to have invited MPs, peers and other key Labour figures to lunch, dinner and late-evening whiskies. The party over New Year was held for members of their respective Treasury and home affairs teams. Mr Balls remains bitter at his defeat by Ed Miliband in the contest that took place after Gordon Brown stepped down as Labour leader following the 2010 Election. But he has recently been overtaken as a potential future leader by his wife, who is seen as being more attractive to the public than her husband, who has a reputation as a political bruiser, despite making attempts to soften his image. Under fire: Balls has reportedly raised the questions of Ed Miliband's political survival among his dinner party guests . In recent times, he has toned down his aggressive style and talked of his love of cooking and how he was learning to play the piano. Mr Balls has also said he cries while watching the TV programme Antiques Roadshow and has claimed that he would happily stand aside to let his wife become leader. But some observers have said this would be untenable, claiming it would be impossible for the formidable Mr Balls to remain Shadow Chancellor because people would suspect he was still pulling the strings behind the scenes. He is still viewed with great suspicion by many Labour politicians, and in particular those close to Tony Blair, who say the Shadow Chancellor was at the heart of the Blair/Brown feuding when Labour was in government. However, other Labour MPs view Mr Balls as one of the party’s few ‘big hitters’, whose warnings that the Coalition is strangling economic growth by slashing public spending too quickly are increasingly being borne out. A spokesman for Mr Balls last night said that he and Ms Cooper had no comment.","Pair have wined-and-dined Labour bigwigs at home .

Escort Dania Londoño caused a storm earlier this year when she revealed that at least ten secret service agents had picked up prostitutes in Columbia brothels - and that one agent refused to pay. She will now tell her story in a book called Room Service, which is likely to further embarrass the Secret Service even further. Scandal that rocked the service: Dania Londoño (in an image she posted on Twitter) alleged that an agent refused to pay her $800 for intimate services . The scandal began following a dispute over payment at the Hotel Caribe in Cartagena on April 12. One man, identified as Arthur Huntington, allegedly agreed on a price of $800 to have sex with Miss Suarez, she said in a recent interview. She explained during a televised interview that during the . transaction she gestured the amount with hand signals and using the . words 'sex', 'sexo', 'cash' and dinero' to get the point across.

She also claims eight members of the U.S. military used girls from the Cartagena brothels. The incidents occurred just a few days before President Obama arrived for a summit, and led to a wave of resignations as the details became public. Following the scandal, Londoño moved to Spain, saying her security was compromised.

"By . Mark Duell . UPDATED: . 23:15 EST, 29 August 2011 . A mother who videoed herself punishing her adopted son by squirting hot sauce into his mouth and giving him a cold shower has avoided jail. Jessica Beagley, 36, of Alaska, was convicted of child abuse after carrying out the brutal punishment on her seven-year-old adopted Russian son. She used an eight-minute video of herself punishing the boy for lying as a ploy to get on the ‘Dr. Phil’ television show, prosecutors said. Discipline: Jessica Beagley shouts at her son before squirting hot sauce into his mouth in a video for the popular television show, 'Dr. Phil' Beagley avoided jail but was sentenced to three years of probation, a 180-day suspended jail term and a $2,500 suspended fine. She submitted the eight-minute tape for a show segment titled ‘Mommy Confessions’ and said the boy lied about getting into trouble at school. After squirting hot sauce in the young boy's mouth for lying, she also punished him with a cold shower. Beagley wasn't trying to get help for him through the show and had set up counselling sessions previously, Cynthia Franklin, prosecuting, said. The punishment of the child on tape was a gratuitous act aimed at getting herself on television, Ms Franklin told the court. ‘Jessica Beagley did not have to make this video and did not have to do this to her son,’ she said. Sentenced: Jessica Beagley, 36, of Alaska, was convicted of child abuse after the brutal punishment for her seven-year-old adopted Russian son . With her husband, an Anchorage police officer, at her side, Beagley said it was her most important job to love and nurture her children. She said being a good mother meant teaching children right from wrong. 'Jessica Beagley did not have to make this video and did not have to do this to her son' Cynthia Franklin, prosecuting . ‘I would ask that the court would allow me to be that mother that I would like to be, to not disrupt the lives of my children any more than has been already,’ she said. Noting the seriousness, District Court Judge David Wallace rejected a request by Beagley's lawyer for a suspended imposition of sentence. This could have allowed Beagley to have her conviction erased. But Judge Wallace said: ‘It was a premeditated, gratuitous act.’ Beagley had faced a maximum sentence of one year in jail and a $10,000 fine. She adopted the boy and his twin brother with her husband in 2008. No jail: Defense lawyer William Ingaldson, sits next to Jessica Beagley, and her husband, Gary, who listen as District Court Judge David Wallace sentences her . The boys were five years old at the time and had spent three years in an orphanage. Before that, their family had lived in a shack and the twins slept on shelves in an armoire. 'I would ask that the court would allow . me to be that mother that I would like to be, to not disrupt the lives . of my children any more than has been already' Jessica Beagley, mother . One twin adjusted to his new home in Alaska, but the other exhibited behavioural problems that included lying and urinating on the floor. Beagley's lawyer said his client turned to unusual forms of punishment when spankings, time-outs and restricting television did not work. Beagley had asked the ‘Dr. Phil’ show for help, William Ingaldson, defending, said. The incident sparking the videoed punishment happened last October. The boy got in trouble at school for sword-fighting with pencils and lying about it, his mother said. Confession: The show's host, Phil McGraw, told Beagley her actions to punish her adopted Russian child were 'outrageous' During the trial, Ms Franklin told the jury it wasn't Beagley's first attempt to get on the 'Dr Phil' show. After seeing a segment in April 2009 titled ‘Angry Moms,’ she contacted the show but heard nothing for a year and a half, Ms Franklin said. Jessica Beagley, 36, was convicted of misdemeanor child abuse at a court in Anchorage, Alaska. She was sentenced by District Court Judge David Wallace to: . The show eventually called to find out if Beagley was still angry, Ms Franklin added. Beagley submitted audition videos in which she yelled at the boy, but producers wanted to see her actually punishing her son, prosecutors said.

Then she recruited her ten-year-old daughter to shoot the video, Mr Franklin said. Days later, Beagley was headed to Los Angeles, California, to tape the show that first aired last November.

Accused: TV anchor Greg Kelly strenuously denies the claims against him; a source says the two exchanged explicit text messages before their date . The woman accusing New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly’s son of rape exchanged 'explicit' texts with Greg both before and after their date, a source has revealed. The source told the New York Post exclusively that she first encountered Greg on a downtown street and told him he was ‘so cute.' ‘They were sexual,’ the source said, referring to the alleged texts. ‘They talked about what they wanted to do to each other.’ The source told the Post that texts between the 29-year-old paralegal and the Good Day New York anchor was like ‘two days of foreplay.’ In all, 17 text messages were exchanged between the two. The woman, whose name has not yet been released, lied to her boyfriend so she could go out and meet Kelly, the source said. She reportedly told him that she was going out to meet a girlfriend.

'I . have absolutely no idea what source of that incendiary quote is,' Mr . Vance said on Saturday, 'nor would I support an anonymous quote like . that.' His comments came days after NYPD boss Raymond Kelly refused to comment on the rape . allegations against his TV host son Greg. The major leak in the investigation came when the District Attorney's . office said it will likely not file criminal charges against the . 43-year-old after he produced text messages he says . prove the sex between him and the woman was consensual. Sources . from the DA's office said they don't buy the law-firm paralegal's . allegations against Greg Kelly and believe it to be a 'bunch of . bulls***.'

Accused: Greg Kelly, right, with his parents Ray - New York City Police Commissioner - and Veronica . 'Whether or not the case is provable, leaking the idea that it seems like . garbage is really reckless,' he said. 'It is unfortunate and it is . dangerous.' 'I'm not answering anything related to that matter,' Commissioner Kelly said at an officer promotion ceremony Friday, the New York Post reported. 'All those questions are for the district attorney.' The Manhattan DA's office is handling the investigation to avoid any conflict of interest at the NYPD, where Greg Kelly's dad is the top cop. The Good Day New York presenter, who was absent from his job this week, claims that 'flirtatious' texts from the woman will show the sex was consensual and they met for that purpose only. An investigator told the New York Daily News: 'That could be the big key. Unless she taped the phone call, whether this guy gets . charged could be determined by the texts.' Full confidence: Good Day New York co-anchor Rosanna Scotto, left, said today that she supports Greg Kelly . The phone call referred to is one . which the alleged victim claims she made to Kelly after the alleged rape . in her downtown Manhattan law office, angrily demanding to know: 'What . happened? Why did you do that?' She claims she was woozy from too much . alcohol and doesn't remember parts of the evening but knows they had . sex and that she didn't consent to it. However a source told the Post she then sent him texts afterwards talking about 'doing it again'. The woman - who has a boyfriend who . had a vasectomy - also claims she became pregnant as a result of the sex . and had to have an abortion. It was her boyfriend that is said to . have encouraged her to go to the police after first confronting police . commissioner Kelly at an event telling him: 'Your son ruined my . girlfriend's life.' Mr Kelly told him to write the . allegations in a letter, but no letter was ever sent before the alleged . victim walked into a New York police station on Tuesday to report the . rape. A source told the New York Post: 'It sounds like she . got caught [cheating] by her boyfriend, and then he forces her hand: ""If you’re not lying, you better report"".' New York Mayor: Michael Bloomberg said yesterday he thinks the case has been handled correctly . The DA's office are said to be . suspicious of the woman's claims for a number of reasons. Questions have been raised over the three-month time delay from when the alleged rape took place on October 8 . and when she actually reported it, the fact she does not remember most details . of the attack, and the fact she stayed in contact with Greg Kelly after . he allegedly raped her. The source told the Post: 'The length of time (she took to complain) is a problem. 'And you don't communicate with someone who raped you.' Another law-enforcement source said: 'The fact pattern is very suspicious . . . It just reeks of bull sh**.' The Manhattan district attorney is . investigating the serious allegations, as an NYPD probe could be seen as . a conflict of interest. Kelly, a former Fox News . correspondent, is cooperating with the investigation, his lawyer, Andrew . Lankler, said in an emailed statement. Greg Kelly 'strenuously denies any wrongdoing of any kind',Mr Lankler . said. 'We know that the district attorney's investigation will prove Mr . Kelly's innocence.' The lawyer didn't respond to questions about the . focus of the investigation. The woman is said to be a graduate . from a prestigious Manhattan private school and is the daughter of a . prominent lawyer. Mayor Bloomberg spoke about the . incident Thursday and said it was the 'right call' to turn it over to . the DA's office to avoid a conflict of interests. Family: Father and son are both well-known figures in New York . He said: 'Everyone has a right to have . their complaints investigated. I suspect that what happens to Ray Kelly . happens to me all the time. 'People are always, while you're . walking through a crowd, saying things. When you get to be my age, you can't hear most of them, ' he said, . referring to the confrontation between the commissioner and the woman's . boyfriend. 'So half the time I have no idea what . they're talking about, and the answer is: If you have a complaint to . write it, and we take every complaint seriously. 'In this case, I thought the Police Department did exactly what they should do. 'And I also point out that as far as I . know, Greg Kelly's not been charged with anything. So I don't know how . that's going to turn out.' Lower Manhattan: The two allegedly went to the South Street Seaport in New York's Financial District for drinks, sources say . Lew Leone, the general manager of the . local Fox station, has meanwhile confirmed Kelly 'has requested some . time off' while the investigation is underway. He did not elaborate. His co-host Rosanna Scotto offered support for him, saying today: 'I love Greg. That’s all I can say.' A friend of the alleged victim’s . boyfriend told ABC News that the woman had been ‘an emotional cripple’ since the alleged incident. Mr Kelly, 43, joined Fox News Channel in 2002 and was the White House correspondent from 2005-2007. A Marine Corps veteran and reservist, he also covered the Iraq War, including four assignments in Baghdad. Before that, he covered politics for local cable news channel New York 1 and was an anchor and reporter for NewsChannel 34, an ABC and NBC affiliate in Binghamton, New York. He also served for nearly a decade in the Marine Corps and is now a lieutenant colonel in its reserves.

Five people were found dead inside an east Denver bar by firefighters responding to an early-morning fire, authorities said. Police are calling the blaze an arson-homicide. Denver Police Chief Robert White says the fire at Fero's Bar & Grill in east Denver was reported at about 2am Wednesday. Scroll down for video . Horrific discovery: The bodies of a man and four woman were discovered at Fero's Bar & Grill in Denver after firefighters extinguished a fire at the bar early Wednesday morning . Investigation: Authorities continue to look into the crime scene; they believe that the victims were killed before the blaze began . Speaking at an impromptu early-morning news conference, Chief White said that the four women and a man also appeared to have suffered other injuries. ‘It appears there was some trauma to the bodies, it also appears to be arson,’ he said, according to the Denver Post. He added did not know if the deaths occurred before or after the bar was closed. Denver Police Commander Ronald Saunier said that the victims were likely killed before the fire was started. He said that the bodies had visible signs of trauma, but would not go into detail over the victims' injuries. 'The business has obviously been set on fire, an arson, I'm guessing, to mask the homicide that occurred inside,' Mr Saunier said. 'There is just trauma, enough information to believe that we have a homicide that occurred here. They didn't perish in the fire.' Grisly: Police said they believe the victims were killed before the fire was started, calling it an arson-homicide . The bar is located in a strip mall about five miles south of downtown Denver just outside of the tony Cherry Creek North shopping district on one of the city's busiest streets, Colorado Boulevard. In listings in Denver's alternative weekly, Westword, Fero's is described as a 'longstanding dive' that attracts regulars as well as people staying in nearby hotels. It shares the strip mall with a check cashing store and a car repair shop. The bar's owners couldn't immediately be reached for comment. No one answered the door at the Aurora home of Young Fero, listed in state records as one of the owners of the bar. A sign on the door read, 'Day sleeper, please don't ring the doorbell! Thank you.' It was signed 'The sleeper,' the Associated Press reported. Neighbour Mike Spinale described Fero as 'really nice.' 'She didn't speak much, but I know she owned a bar and she worked all the time,' Mr Spinale told AP. 'She told me she did everything herself.' Location: Fero's Bar & Grill is located in a shopping complex next to a check cashing business . After sunrise, residents in a neighbouring apartment building were out walking their dogs as police looked in trash bins and checked out cars parked outside. The five dead are believed to be the only ones in the bar when the fire started - other than whoever is responsible for their deaths -so police are asking anyone else who was at the place earlier to come forward, as investigators try to piece together what happened. The victims haven't been identified. Autopsies were expected to be conducted later in the day. Frank Peluso, who works in an office building a half block away, said he used to eat lunch at the bar but hasn't been there in three years. He said it seemed to be declining and the owners have tried various things to attract more business, including offering karaoke. 'It's one of those places that you wonder how it stays in business,' Mr Peluso said. Resident Matthew Neam said you can't see into the bar because the front windows are frosted. He said he and his friend used to joke about what might be inside. 'I've never gone in there. It always looked kind of sketchy to me,' Mr Neam said.","Firefighters responding to early-morning blaze discovered five bodies in bar .

Sporting glasses and a pencil protector during high school really is a death sentence, according to a new paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research. Though the marginalized adolescent brainiacs have oft been encouraged that success later in life can be their best revenge, a team of researchers found that social success in high school is actually key to making it in the real world. A team of researchers tracked a group of students from high school to adulthood and found that those who were rated as popular retained their appeal in the marketplace and earned an average of 2 per cent more than their geeky counterparts. Scroll down for video. The ruling class: Popularity, social graces, wealth and intelligence are key ingredients to becoming a high school Brahmin. Pictured, the social elite as represented by the cast of Gossip Girl . Authors Gabriela Conti, from the . Harris School of Public Policy at The University of Chicago, Gerrit . Mueller from Germany's Institute of Employment Research, and University of Essex researchers Andrea Gaeotti and Stephen Pudney have concluded that over the years, being cool in school will pay off. 'We investigate these questions [about the impact of high school social standing] using an objective measure of popularity derived from sociometric theory: the number . of friendship nominations received from schoolmates, interpreted as a . measure of early accumulation of personal social capital,' wrote the academics who authored the working paper, published in October. In . the scientific quest to understand the impact of a high schooler's . social standing, researchers looked at Wisconsin's Longitudinal Study, a . survey that has tracked a group of students in the Badger State who . graduated in 1957. The . study has monitored this population of roughly 10,000 and reviewed their progress over the course . of 35 years. After . tracking this group through the years, the cool kids still stood out among . the crowd, earning an estimated 2 per cent more than their less cool . compadres. So many friends, so little time: Social success in high school actually yields results in the real world.

Pictured, the cast of the 1984 college comedy, Revenge of the Nerds . To measure popularity, researchers had respondents list three students they considered to be their closest friends. Researchers reviewed the answers and the names most frequently listed were considered to be the most popular from the group. 'Popularity as measured by the number . of friendship nominations that the student receives from his school . mates has a sizable effect... consistent with our view, we interpret . our measure of popularity as a measure of the stock of social skills of a . particular individual,' the researchers wrote. 'If Paul nominates John as his friend, he reveals his affection towards John. In receiving a claim of friendship, John is socially approved by Paul. We can then distinguish students on the basis of the number of friendship nominations they give.' They found some trends . among this elite group. The cool kids tended to come from 'warm family . environments,' they actually excelled at school and contrary to conventional wisdom that being brainy is a turn off, intelligence was part of their allure. The research also found that if an individual moved from the 20th percentile of popular to the 80th percentile, that could provide a salary that was 10 per cent higher, over the course of 40 years. Popularity was found to be a key factor in this determination, even after accounting for a person's family background, school quality, cognitive ability and adult personality traits. The popularity . factor seemed to give a student a leg up in the real world because . it was the training needed 'to be socially adequate for the successful . performance of their adult roles,' the authors concluded.

Sir Richard Branson has been asked to continue running the West Coast Rail Line for another year, as minsters scramble to keep trains moving. In an embarrassing u-turn, the Department for Transport had to plead with Virgin Trains to remain in control of the line for between nine and 13 months despite stripping it of the lucrative franchise in August. Virgin was due to hand over the line to rival First Group on December 9 but ‘significant technical flaws’ in the contract competition were unearthed this month, which saw three civil servants suspended and the deal torn up. Virgin Trains boss SVirgin Trains boss Sir Richard Branson has been asked to continue running services on the West Coast main line for up to 13 months . Virgin Trains will now run the services in the short term while the government decides who will operate the franchise on a more permanent basis. Today Sir Richard said on Twitter: 'Positive day for all the wonderful staff at Virgin Trains.' The decision marks a major PR coup for Sir Richard, who said on Twitter: 'Positive day for all the wonderful staff at Virgin Trains.' This summer the tycoon saw his complaints that the contest had not been fair repeatedly rebuffed by the government. He branded the bidding process for the London to Scotland line ‘insane’ and launched a legal challenge. He called on David Cameron to intervene, but the Prime Minister was assured that the decision was safe. As the DfT prepared for the court case, major flaws were discovered in the use of inflation and passenger numbers. The future of the West Coast Main Line, which runs from London to Scotland, will remain uncertain for several months . The collapse of the deal is expected to cost taxpayers more than £100million in compensation and re-running a new bidding process. The quick-fix of Virgin running services until next year will be followed by an interim franchisee before the full-length contract is awarded. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said today: ‘The cancellation of the InterCity West Coast franchise is deeply regrettable and I apologise to the bidders involved and taxpayers who have a right to expect better. ‘My priority now is to fix the problem and the first step is to take urgent action to ensure that on December 9 services continue to run to the same standard and passengers are not affected. ‘I believe Virgin remaining as operator for a short period of time is the best way to do this and my officials and I will be working flat out to make this happen.’ Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin today said the cancellation of the West Coast franchise is 'deeply regrettable' As the rail chaos grips the department, Mr Mcloughlin also announced he was pausing the live competitions to run services on Essex Thameside, Great Western and Thameslink. Two independent reviews will also examine what went to catastrophically wrong with the West Coast competition and the way the DfT runs its rail franchise programme. Virgin has run the West Coast line since 1997 but in August Justine Greening, the then Transport Secretary, announced she was handing a new 13-year deal to FirstGroup. As DfT officials prepared for Virgin’s legal challenge to the decision, they uncovered major problems with the economic model used to decide who to award the contract to. Today a Virgin Trains spokesman said: 'Our customers have made clear they want us to continue our excellent service and we now have the chance to deliver that and offer customers some short-term continuity. 'We will now be working hard to make sure we continue to provide the service that has made us successful. We are grateful for the fantastic support from customers and staff over recent months.' Angela Eagle, Labour's shadow transport secretary, said ministers could not claim to be unaware of the details of the deal. She told BBC News: 'These are multi-billion pound contracts. This contract was supposed to run for up to 15 years. It’s simply not good enough for ministers to claim that it was all a technical issue, and that they couldn’t be expected to look at this, at the same time as they’ve made franchising much more complex, they have then taken away part of the Department’s ability to deal with this, and removed the department’s capacity to get it externally checked. 'That to me seems to be squarely a problem with ministerial oversight, ministerial leadership, and it’s not correct for them to try and blame three civil servants for what’s gone wrong – especially not before their own investigation has even reported.' The Flying Scotsman service was reintroduced by the government-owned Directly Operated Railways . The decision to ask Virgin to continue running trains on the West Coast line means ministers have rejected the idea of running the line themselves. Renationalisation of the railways is something the unions have demanded for years.In 2009 National Express walked away from the East Coast Main Line franchise, and the Labour government took control of services. A new government-owned company, Directly Operated Railways, was created and has run the services ever since. It recorded a seven per cent rise in profits to £7.1 million in 2011-12. In the four weeks to August 19, 93 per cent of East Coast trains were on time up from 87 per cent on 2011. The four-hour Flying Scotsman express . service from Edinburgh to London (pictured) was reinstated and extra services to . Lincoln and Harrogate were introduced. The apparent success of the state-running of services caused the RMT transport union to call for the same to happen on the West Coast line. Responding to the news that Virgin will continue to operate the franchise for up to 13 months, RMT leader Bob Crow said today: 'The Government are ideologically opposed to public ownership of the railways and, in collusion with the private train operators, have stitched up a shabby deal that will enable them to rerun the whole franchise fiasco in a year’s time. 'Richard Branson and his shareholders are laughing all the way to the bank. Not only have they made hundreds of millions from the rail privatisation lottery but they have now scooped the rollover as well. 'We will continue to fight for public ownership of the railways, a position supported by the vast majority of the British people. This short-term political fix will not detract from the call for rail to be run as a public service free from the chaos and greed of privatisation.' DOR overhauled the East Coast timetable, introducing almost 20 new weekday services. It also invested in better First Class carriages including at seat food and drink and on board wi-fi which lead to First Class passenger numbers rising by a third.","Virgin boss hails a 'positive day' for his staff as the Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin says the public deserve better .

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin today said the cancellation of the West Coast franchise is 'deeply regrettable' Ministers spent £1million preparing to take charge of the West Coast main line from Whitehall before resorting to pleading with Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin trains to continue running his trains. Five civil servants drew up a plan for the lucrative line from London to Scotland to be renationalised after the collapse of the franchise competition which had been won by Virgin’s rival FirstGroup. But as the clock ticked down to the December 9 deadline when Virgin was due to be kicked off the London to Scotland line, ministers were forced to ask Sir Richard to stay on while they find a more permanent solution. The £1million price tag for the abortive plan for the line to be taken back into public control will raise further questions about the Department for Transport’s handling of big rail franchises. Labour's shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle today responded to the revelation by calling on ministers to 'come clean' about the full scale of the cost of the fiasco. FirstGroup was awarded the £13billion, 13-year deal in August but Virgin launched a legal challenge. As officials prepared for the High Court proceedings last month, ‘significant technical flaws’ in the contract competition were unearthed. Three civil servants were suspended and the deal was suspended. In a major PR coup for Virgin, last week Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin asked Sir Richard to continue running services after December 9 for up to 13 months. However, it has now emerged that the minister drew up plans to take control of the line himself, through the government’s company, Directly Operated Railways.

MPs: ‘Directly Operated Railways has been undertaking prudent . contingency preparations and they will continue to stand ready should . they be required. ‘We do . not yet have final figures, but spend to date has been around £1 . million. This includes expenditure on salaries and consultants.’ He added that the work consisted of . ‘prudent contingency preparations and they will continue to stand ready . should they be required’.

Lohan, 26, had been scheduled to . appear in Manhattan court in New York on Tuesday over her September 19 arrest for leaving the . scene of the accident, in which she allegedly drove a Porsche into a . bystander at The Dream Hotel. However after examining surveillance footage, prosecutors have determined there is not enough evidence to get a conviction. The alleged victim, restaurant worker Jose Rodriguez, could still pursue . civil charges - but Lindsay is said to be 'ecstatic' that the criminal . case has now been dismissed, TMZ claims. The news comes as Lohan's father is seeking a conservatorship for her. Michael Lohan is convinced his . daughter has resumed abusing drink and drugs and after trying to stage . an intervention on Friday he is trying to go through the courts to get a . conservator appointed to look after Lindsay. Michael claims his daughter is hanging out with the wrong people, including her mother, Dina Lohan. He is not requesting he be made . conservator - an appointed person who has legal control over the subject . - as he doesn't want to be in control of Lindsay's finances, so people . can accuse him of going after her money. According to website TMZ, Michael wants a judge to decide who to appoint conservator, but he says he will not accept Dina. Michael has told his lawyer the first . thing he plans once there is a conservatorship in place is to convince . them to send Lindsay to rehab. He claims every time Lindsay has been to rehab 'she went in dirty and didn't come out clean'. He also blames the people around Lindsay for helping to fuel her addictions. And he believes he, Dina and Lindsay need to go for family therapy, which his ex-wife has refused in the past. However according to TMZ Lindsy has laughed off reports that he father wants to be made her conservator. According to the website, the actress told a pal: 'No judge would buy it . 'They would have a hard time . believing the claims of someone who was investigated for insider . trading, arrested for domestic violence multiple times, arrested for . assault, has a drunk driving arrest, and has been in and out of jail and . prison for years.'

The police force under fire for its role in changing evidence from the Hillsborough disaster is today under pressure over its role in prosecutions made during the 1984 Miners' Strike. South Yorkshire Police is facing calls for an inquiry into allegations some police colluded in writing statements after the infamous violence between officers and pickets at the Orgreave coking plant. Lawyers claim there was ‘widespread collusion’ between officers five years before the Hillsborough tragedy when 96 Liverpool fans died and statements were altered to remove criticism of police. South Yorkshire police face claims officers used the same phrases in dozens of witness statements from the Battle of Orgreave between officers and miners in 1984 . The Hillsborough Independent Panel report, chaired by the Bishop of Liverpool, claimed 164 police statements were altered in the wake of the tragedy. Tonight a BBC documentary will reveal allegations that officers from the same force colluded in compiling evidence from the so-called Battle of Orgreave in Rotherham, South Yorkshire. More than 90 people were arrested in one of the most famous clashes of the year-long miners’ strike. The Inside Out Yorkshire and Lincolnshire programme claims to have obtained copies of around 100 police witness statements which it is claimed show the extent to which officers used identical phrases to describe what they had seen. The Independent Police Complaints Commission is expected to be asked to look at the claims, which could undermine convictions of those arrested. Chris Kitchen, general secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers, said: ‘Many miners were subjected to malpractice during the strike by South Yorkshire police – and other forces. ‘I will be asking the NUM's national executive committee to consider complaining to the IPCC and DPP for the police operations at Orgreave and elsewhere during the strike to be investigated, now the details of what South Yorkshire police did at Hillsborough have been revealed,’ he told The Guardian. Former Labour MP Vera Baird QC, who represented Orgreave miners in court, said she was 'frankly shocked' by the 'deliberate nature' of putting together this case against those involved in the clashes . Former Labour MP Vera Baird QC, who represented Orgreave miners in court, said: ‘I was frankly shocked by Orgreave by the deliberate nature of putting together this case.’ Barrister Mark George QC carried out analysis of dozens of documents. He found that 34 officers' statements, used the identical phrase: . ‘Periodically there was missile throwing from the back of the pickets.’ Some 22 statements used the same paragraph, of four full sentences, including the phrase: ‘There was however a continual barrage of missiles.’ Mr George told the BBC: ‘It's very obvious in the Orgreave case that there was widespread collusion.’ Mounted police moved in on striking miners picketing at Orgreave coking plant, near Sheffield when 90 people were arrested . Asked about the Inside Out programme, a South Yorkshire Police spokeswoman said: ‘South Yorkshire Police notes the issues raised in the programme and will consider whether any review is necessary. ‘The force is not aware of any adverse comment about the statements from the trial judge in the case. ‘If concerns existed then normal practice would have been for the judge to raise them at the time.’ However, the claims will add to the pressure on the force, coming just weeks after revelations about its handling of the Hillsborough tragedy. The independent panel last month revealed 116 statements had negative comments about the policing of the football match removed or changed. Last week, the current South Yorkshire chief constable, David Crompton, told MPs his force would take just two weeks to give the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) the names and addresses of up to 1,000 officers who were on duty on the day of the Hillsborough disaster.","190 people were arrested during clashes in the 1984 Battle of Orgreave between officers and pickets .

Connect: David Cameron, will be urged to adopt policies which appeal to the 'strivers' Forty Tory MPs are behind a Blue Collar Conservatives Group set up to woo back aspirational voters lost by the party, it emerged last night. David Cameron, who has faced criticism that he and his Cabinet are ‘out of touch’, will be urged to adopt policies which appeal to the ‘strivers’. The group will try to champion the plight of the socio-economic ‘C2 and D’ groups, the struggling private sector workers who helped Margaret Thatcher secure her election victories. Carlisle MP John Stevenson said: ‘The Conservative Party already has a lot of policies which appeals to this section of society but we have not been able to channel that into an electoral alliance on the ground.’ He admitted that the row over class which had engulfed the party had not helped, adding that ‘the Conservative Party has certainly scored some own goals recently.’ Mr Stevenson said Blue Collar Conservatives would call on the Government to raise the tax threshold to be in line with the minimum wage. Clark Vasey, founder and co-ordinator of the group, said: ‘You don’t have to work in a factory to support us, it is about sharing the same values.’ Mr Vasey, an aviation security consultant, said while he was now middle-class, he identified with the values of his factory worker father and his shop assistant mother, who had left school at 14. Change: The group will try to champion the plight of the socio-economic 'C2 and D' groups, the struggling private sector workers who helped Margaret Thatcher secure her election victories . He said the Prime Minister was doing a good job and had recognised the ‘strivers’ in his conference speech, but he added that ‘perception matters, and there is a perception that the Tory party is out of touch’. The group has the backing of 40 MPs so far, including Mr Stevenson and Yorkshire MP Philip Davies.Mr Vasey wrote to all Conservative MPs shortly before their party conference. In the same week, former party deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft identified ‘Blue Collar Tories’ as the key to winning the 2015 election. At the last General Election, the Tories won 29 per cent of these voters, compared with 19 per cent who voted Labour. Now, 25 per cent say they will vote for Labour, with 20 per cent intending to vote Conservative again.","David Cameron, has faced criticism that he and Cabinet are 'out of touch'

A new photo has emerged showing the gunman behind massacre at a suburban Milwaukee spa on Sunday posing for the camera with an assault rifle. Radcliffe Haughton, 45, would have had to give up the weapon and all of his other guns once his estranged wife's restraining order, filed three days before the shooting, made it through the legal system. His wife Zina is reportedly among the three women who were killed when he opened fire a Azana Spa in Brookfield, Wisconsin. Four others were hospitalized with non-life threatening gunshot wounds. Dangerous: This photo is believed to be Radcliffe Haughton holding an assault rifle. He would have been forced to give up his guns when a restraining order against him took effect . Troubled: Haughton, 45, had recently slashed his wife's tired and was given a restraining order . Police have not released the names of the victims in Sunday morning's shooting, but WTMJ-TV in Milwaukee quotes an anonymous source as saying Mrs Haughton was murdered in the attack. Officers believe Radcliffe Haughton was looking for his wife when he entered the spa about 11.10am and began shooting. The two were having marital problems and she had recently moved out of their house. He committed suicide after the rampage inside the spa. Mrs Haughton was a respected hair stylist at the salon who was highly sought-after by customers. Court . records show that a judge issued a order of protection against Haughton on Thursday, and said there was a credible threat against her. Under that order, Haughton was required to turn in his guns -- though it's unclear when that part of the order would have taken effect. The protection order was filed after an . October 4 incident at the salon, when Haughton slashed his wife's tires . in the parking lot. Haughton's daughter, age 13, and Mrs Haughton's daughter from a previous relationship, age 20, . were both found by police and are safe. One of the them was at the salon at the time of the shooting, according to Brown Deer police chief . Steven Rinzel. During the investigation, cops encountered smoke from a small fire that had been started in the building, prompting them to issue a call for extreme caution and keeping them out. Brookfield Police Chief Daniel Tushaus said at an evening news conference: 'It appears that he is deceased of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.' He added: 'There is no other suspect that we are seeking.' In an earlier statement to the press, Chief Tushaus said the shooting began at 11.09am Sunday morning inside the Azana Spa.

Federal investigation: An FBI tactical team patrols outside the Brookfield Square mall in Brookfield, Wisconsin, after the shooting at the Azana Spa . Perimeter: Tactical team members move past a McDonald's on the way to spa next door where the shooting occurred . Chief Rinzel said that his department was familiar with Haughton - most recently on a domestic violence investigation at the home, which resulted in Haughton's arrest. The Journal Sentinel contacted the suspect's father, Radcliffe Haughton Sr., who lives in Florida. He said the he spoke to his son by phone last week shortly after his estranged wife had been awarded the restraining order against him. 'I told him, whatever you do, don't do anything stupid,' Mr Haughton Sr. said. 'He told me, ""I have to get out of Wisconsin."" 'I am so saddened. I don't know what to tell you. As his father, I am very, very sorry and I did not expect this from my son.

A witness saw a woman screaming, and running out of the spa towards traffic. 'She ran right out into the street (and) was pounding on cars,' David Gosh told The Journal Sentinel. He then saw a man carrying a handgun run after her, and he was thought to be chasing after the woman. The gunman then saw police beginning to gather and he ran back in the direction in which he came, and back into the spa. First responders: Emergency vehicles surround the spa after the shooting massacre . On the scene: Multiple ambulances responded to the shooting Sunday afternoon . Unknowns: The shooting began at a spa near a Milwaukee mall . 'He was the shooter. He was looking for an escape route,' Mr Gosh said. A witness told the Journal-Sentinel that a he saw a young girl running through a parking lot in a panic after her mother was reportedly shot. 'She was screaming, yelling, crying hysterical. She was pleading for help,' Christopher Pfeiffer told the local paper. 'She . kept saying, ""My mother was shot."" And she mentioned that there was a . gunman. She ran into the bookstore and I followed her. But I watched her . from afar.' Live video of the Azana spa shows a tactical team moving in around 2pm on Sunday.

Almost every woman accused of being a witch is poor and powerless. An ActionAid survey of the camps found more than 70 per cent of women were accused of being witches after their husbands died. The survey also found one in three women in the camp was not earning money before they were accused of being a witch and were seen as an economic burden by their community. However, the camps do provide sanctuary for women accused of being witches, as many in their communities believe the women cannot practice witchcraft once they are in a camp. ActionAid calls on the government of Ghana to ensure the basic human rights of women in the camps are upheld with access to health and education services. Action Aid also believes the international community and UK government must do all they can to address issues relating to the ‘witch’ camps’ and engage with the Ghanaian government to ensure women’s human rights are protected.","Hundreds of women in northern Ghana are accused of witchcraft and condemned to a life of violence, harassment and isolation ."

Mary Archer, who worked at the restaurant chain in East Dayton, Ohio, had to climb through a drive-thru window to escape the robber, who rang the doorbell armed with a knife just as she was closing up for the night. The 56-year-old said she was cornered in the fast food chain's office by the man, who repeatedly shouted 'give me the money'. Fearing for her life, she made her escape - only to be fired the next day for being alone in the restaurant at the time. Fired: Mary Archer, 56, had worked for Arby's for 23 years before the attempted robbery on Friday night . Late night attack: The Arby's fast food restaurant in East Dayton was attacked on Friday night . The attempted robbery happened in the early hours of Saturday morning as Archer closed up following a busy night. Her co-worker had just left at about 12.45am when, a few minutes later, the doorbell rang. Ms Archer, who has worked at Arby's for 23 years, said her first thoughts were that her co-worker had left her belongings behind - but instead the man burst in demanding money. She told News Center 7 how she was cornered in the office, before shoving the man backwards and escaping through the window, where she screamed for help. She said: “He held up a knife and kept saying ""give me the money"". 'I had pushed him away…because I’m like, ‘I’m not going to die in Arby’s tonight…I’m just not.' A customer at a nearby shop heard her calls for help and called the police. Vulnerable: Archer said the fast food chain has been targeted three times in the last six months . But although the thief fled empty-handed, the event ended up costing Archer her job. The following day she was told she had broken Arby's safety and security policy by being alone in the fast food business when it was robbed. For this, she was fired less than 24 hours after the armed robbery - which Archer said was the third attempted robbery within six months. The thief was described as about 5-foot-10, 150 pounds and wore a dark colored hoodie, dark pants and a dark wool stocking cap. Arby's told New Center 7 that violations of its safety and security policy mean termination of employment without exception. A vice-president of Arby’s Human Resources told WHIO TV that 'he feels bad that Ms. Archer had to go through this' - but that she knowingly violated the company’s safety and security policy, and had been warned before.

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 11:47 EST, 23 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:00 EST, 23 October 2012 . Infiltrating: Shamuir Rahman (left) attended a Muslim student group's talk, where he posed for a photo with prominent but controversial New York imam Siraj Wahhaj (right) A paid informant for the New York Police Department's intelligence unit was under orders to 'bait' Muslims into saying incriminating things as he lived a double life. Shamiur Rahman, a 19-year-old American of Bengali descent, was paid up to $1,000 per month for snapping pictures inside mosques and collecting the names of innocent people attending study groups on Islam, he told The Associated Press. He now denounces his work as an informant, saying police told him to embrace a strategy called 'create and capture.' The strategy had him create a conversation about jihad or terrorism, then capturing the response to send to the NYPD. In addition to the monthly payments, Rahman also earned goodwill from the police after a string of minor marijuana arrests. 'We need you to pretend to be one of them,' Rahman recalled the police telling him. 'It's street theater.' Rahman, who said he plans to move to the Caribbean, said he now believes his work as an informant against Muslims in New York was 'detrimental to the Constitution.' After he disclosed to friends details about his work for the police — and after he told the police that he had been contacted by the AP — he stopped receiving text messages from his NYPD handler, 'Steve,' and his handler's NYPD phone number was disconnected. Rahman's account shows how the NYPD unleashed informants on Muslim neighborhoods, often without specific targets or criminal leads. Much of what Rahman said represents a tactic the NYPD has denied using. Informants like Rahman are a central component of the NYPD's wide-ranging programs to monitor life in Muslim neighborhoods since the 2001 terrorist attacks. Police officers have eavesdropped inside Muslim businesses, trained video cameras on mosques and collected license plates of worshippers. Informants who trawl the mosques — known informally as 'mosque crawlers' — tell police what the imam says at sermons and provide police lists of attendees, even when there's no evidence they committed a crime. The programs were built with unprecedented help from the CIA. Secrets: In the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the NYPD activated and enlisted informants who could attend Muslim community events and mosques without being noticed . Police recruited Rahman in late January, after his third arrest on misdemeanor drug charges, which Rahman believed would lead to serious legal consequences. An NYPD plainclothes officer approached him in a Queens jail and asked whether he wanted to turn his life around: the next month, Rahman said, he was on the NYPD's payroll. NYPD spokesman Paul Browne did not immediately return a message seeking comment about Tuesday. He has denied widespread NYPD spying, saying police only follow leads. Rahman said he received little training and spied on 'everything and anyone.' He took pictures inside the many mosques he visited and eavesdropped on imams. By his own measure, he said he was very good at his job and his handler never once told him he was collecting too much, no matter whom he was spying on. Rahman said he thought he was doing important work protecting New York City and considered himself a hero. One of his earliest assignments was to spy on a February lecture at the Muslim Student Association at John Jay College in Manhattan. The speaker was Ali Abdul Karim, the head of security at the Masjid At-Taqwa mosque in Brooklyn. The NYPD had been concerned about Karim for years and already had infiltrated the mosque, according to NYPD documents obtained by the AP. Denials: Police officials, including commissioner Ray Kelly, denied widespread NYPD spying, saying police only follow leads . Rahman also was instructed to monitor the student group itself, though he wasn't told to target anyone specifically. His NYPD handler, Steve, told him to take pictures of people at the events, determine who belonged to the student association and identify its leadership. Rahman attended the event with Karim and listened, ready to catch what he called a 'speaker's gaffe.' The NYPD was interested in buzz words such as 'jihad' and 'revolution,' he said. Any radical rhetoric, the NYPD told him, needed to be reported. Talha Shahbaz, then the vice president of the student group, met Rahman at the event. As Karim was finishing his talk on Malcolm X's legacy, Rahman told Shahbaz that he wanted to know more about the student group. Rahman told the student leader that he wanted to turn his life around and stop using drugs, and said he believed Islam could provide a purpose in life. In the following days, Rahman friended him on Facebook and the two exchanged phone numbers. Shahbaz, a Pakistani who came to the U.S. more three years ago, introduced Rahman to other Muslims. 'He was telling us how he loved Islam and it's changing him,' said Asad Dandia, who also became friends with Rahman. Within the ranks: According to the report, the NYPD regularly sent a number of informants into Muslim-heavy events . Really, Rahman was mining his new friends for details about their lives, taking pictures of them when they ate at restaurants and writing down license plates on the orders of the NYPD. On the NYPD's instructions, he went to more events at John Jay, including when Siraj Wahhaj spoke in May. Wahhaj, 62, is a prominent but controversial New York imam who has attracted the attention of authorities for years. Prosecutors included his name on a 3 ½-page list of people they said 'may be alleged as co-conspirators' in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, though he was never charged. In 2004, the NYPD placed Wahhaj on an internal terrorism watch list and noted: 'Political ideology moderately radical and anti-American.' Rahman was told to spy on the speakers at the annual Islamic Circle of North America and Muslim American Society held in Hartford, Connecticut. According to NYPD documents obtained by the AP, the NYPD sent three informants there in 2008 and was keeping tabs on the group's former president. Rahman, who was born in Queens, said he never witnessed any criminal activity or saw anybody do anything wrong. Look out: Rahman said that he was never given specific instructions on what or who to look for, but told to bring up controversial topics and see how they reacted . He did say that he sometimes intentionally misinterpreted what people had said. For example, Rahman said he would ask people what they thought about the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Libya, knowing the subject was inflammatory. It was easy to take statements out of context, he said. He said wanted to please his NYPD handler, whom he trusted and liked. 'I was trying to get money,' Rahman said. 'I was playing the game.' Rahman said police never discussed the activities of the people he was assigned to target for spying. He said police told him once, 'We don't think they're doing anything wrong. We just need to be sure.' Rahman said he eventually tired of spying on his friends, noting that at times they delivered food to needy Muslim families. He took $200 more from the NYPD and told them he was done as an informant. He said the NYPD offered him more money, which he declined. He told friends on Facebook in early October that he had been a police spy but had quit. He also traded Facebook messages with Shahbaz, admitting he had spied on students at John Jay. 'I was an informant for the NYPD, for a little while, to investigate terrorism,' he wrote on October 2. He said he no longer thought it was right. Perhaps he had been hunting terrorists, he said, 'but I doubt it.'","Police enticed Shamiur Rahman, 19, to help spy on Muslims for them .

Controversial: Planning minister Nick Boles defended the new policy - arguing the current regulations are holding back economic growth . The minister behind controversial planning reforms rounded on his critics yesterday, saying unsightly home extensions were not a ‘crime against humanity’. Nick Boles – who has previously described green belt campaigners as ‘Luddites’ – defended Government plans to double the size of extensions permitted without planning consent. Town hall chiefs have hit out at the policy, saying it would encourage unsightly buildings, while councils have refused to implement the plans. But in a combative session with MPs yesterday, the Planning Minister insisted that fees and regulations were holding back economic growth. And he claimed that when councils scrapped ‘expensive and unnecessary bureaucracy’, they would find ‘the world doesn’t end’. Mr Boles also announced that major commercial projects would have to be fast-tracked through the planning process or they would be taken out of councils’ hands. Business parks, distribution centres, chemical works, oil refineries and manufacturing plants will have to be processed within a year or the decision would be referred to the Government’s Planning Inspectorate – with no right of appeal. In his first appearance at the Communities and Local Government Committee, Mr Boles insisted many homeowners were being put off building works because of prohibitive planning fees of around £2,000. Families can currently build a 10ft single storey extension to a terraced property and 13ft to a detached home without permission. David Cameron wants to double these limits to 20ft and 26ft respectively, for three years. Additions: Homeowners can currently build a 10ft extension at a terraced property - and 13ft at a detached house - without planning consent . Mr Boles said the change was ‘not a free for all’ as an extension could not take up more than half the property’s garden and neighbours’ rights to light and party walls would be protected.‘It’s quite a limited proposal,’ the Planning Minister said. ‘We have a growth problem. The economic situation is such that we have an urgent need to support growth. We want to encourage people to do extensions in three years because the construction industry is having a miserable time and we need construction activity in local areas. ‘But if, as I fully expect, in three years everybody has accepted it, we may look at keeping it.’ He added: ‘The simple question is, is it really such an appalling thing to take the permitted extension right on a terraced house from three metres [10 feet] to six metres [20 feet]? ‘I can see it’s a liberalisation, we came into government to do things like that. But I don’t see it as a sort of crime against humanity.’ Extensions: A YouGov poll commissioned by the Royal Institute of British Architects revealed 54 per cent believe the shake-up would lower the quality of neighbourhood design . Last year councils rejected outright 10 per cent of the 200,000 applications they received. A spokesman for the Local Government Association – which represents more than 370 councils – said: ‘The 22,000 applications rejected each year are knocked back for good reasons and it would be wrong if extensions which were previously rejected due to objections from neighbours or because they were judged to blight the neighbourhood could now sneak back in.’ Tory-run councils in Lincolnshire, Mr Boles’s constituency, as well as Richmond in southwest London have already said they will not cooperate. Whitehall sources said that plans to fast-track major infrastructure would limit residents’ legal bills for opposing them and make the process transparent.","Nick Boles defended Government .

Alex Salmond labelled UK politicians ‘incompetent Lord Snooties’ as he declared it was ‘game on’ for the independence referendum. The Scottish First Minister hit out at the Government who he claimed was ‘unwilling to do what is best for Scotland’. With voters north of the border due to vote on the country’s future in 2014, Mr Salmond insisted: ‘Now is the time for Scotland to choose, to seize a different future.’ Thumbs up: Alex Salmond said it was 'game on' for the independence referendum . The First Minister used his speech to the Scottish National Party’s annual conference in Perth to launch a furious attack on a Westminster Government plagued by political woes in the last 24 hours. Andrew Mitchell yesterday resigned as chief whip after just six weeks in the job. He admitted he had lost the confidence of Tory MPs after launching a foul-mouthed tirade at police officers in Downing Street – althoughhe continued to insist he had not called a policeman a ‘pleb’. Meanwhile Chancellor George Osborne was forced to pay a £160 upgrade for his train ticket after he was caught sitting in first class with only a standard ticket. To cheers from the audience Mr Salmond asked: ‘Why on earth do we allow this incompetent bunch of Lord Snooties to be in positions of authority over our country?’ He added: ‘Westminster would put this first class nation in the second class carriages.’ The SNP leader then declared: ‘No more second best for Scotland. It is time, it is past time, for a fresh start for our nation.’ Incompetent bunch of Lord Snooties: The Scottish First Minister hit out at Westminster politicans who have been plagued by woes. George Osbourne (pictured) was caught sitting in First Class with a Standard ticket . On your bike! Andrew Mitchell resigned as Chief Whip after just six weeks in the job after a spat with a policeman . Mr Salmond told the conference: ‘Westminster has had its chance and Westminster has fallen short. ‘It’s not just that in Westminster and London we have a government that is unwilling to do what is best for Scotland. It is incapable of putting the people of Scotland first.’ He continued his attack, criticising the UK Government’s stewardship of the economy and its continued support for nuclear weapons. ‘We face a Westminster government that is hell-bent on pulling our society apart at the seams,’ Mr Salmond said. ‘Austerity, a one-way street with tax cuts for the rich and benefit cuts for the poor. ‘Billions to be spent on new nuclear weapons while families struggle to heat their homes. ‘What kind of brave new world is this?’ In his keynote conference address the Fist Minster declared: ‘Westminster is beyond salvation.’ But he added: ‘Our social democratic Scotland can still be won.’ With the independence referendum taking place in two years he said the choice before voters was clear. Mr Salmond said: ‘Scotland can vote no and achieve nothing. 'There must be a better way': Mr Salmond stressed that the referendum was not just about an independent Scotland . ‘Or we can vote yes to get the platform that we need.’ Although a poll on Thursday showed just 30 per cent of Scots supported leaving the UK, Mr Salmond insisted there was a majority in favour of some kind of constitutional change. He told the packed auditorium: ‘Many want independence. Many want more powers. But have no doubt, once again the majority of our fellow citizens are for change.’ ‘Over these next two years our task is clear. To tell the truth about Scotland and what we can achieve. To proclaim that we have, in ourselves, all we need to truly prosper. ‘That is the platform on which we shall win independence for our country.’ Mr Salmond insisted if Scotland left the UK it would benefit from an ‘independence dividend’. He claimed the SNP's defence plans would cost almost £1billion a year less than under Westminster rule, with £230million of that coming from ending payments for the Trident nuclear weapons programme. And he pledged over the next year Scottish Nationalists would ‘spell out what that independence dividend can do for services and for jobs’. The First Minister insisted Scotland was ‘financially stronger than the UK as a whole to the tune of £2.7billion’, saying that while the country paid 9.6% of taxation it received a smaller proportion - 9.3 per cent - of UK Government spending. 'Game on'! Mr Salmond's conference came after signing a deal with David Cameron on the staging of the referendum . He argued: ‘With access to our own resources we could invest more, borrow less and save for the future, protect services, or a combination of the three.’ He described the run-up to the independence referendum as being the two most important years in the SNP's history, announcing his Scottish Government would introduce legislation within the next few weeks to ensure that all 16 and 17-year-olds could vote in that ballot. The First Minister stressed that the campaign for independence was not just about achieving the party's constitutional objective. ‘This referendum is not just about an independent Scotland,’ he said. ‘It is about our belief that for Scotland there can be - there must be - a better way. ‘It is about using that power to create a more prosperous economy and a more just society.’ Mr Salmond's conference address comes just five days after he signed a deal with Prime Minister David Cameron on the staging of the referendum, . And he declared: ‘It is game on for Scotland. This referendum creates a once in a generation opportunity’ He hit out at the anti-independence campaign, saying: ‘Instead of telling people in Scotland what they can do, they tell us what we can't do.’ Mr Salmond continued: ‘Their message is clear enough 'Abandon hope all ye who vote No'.’ It was only independence, he insisted, that would protect the gains Scotland had made since devolution, such as the introduction of free personal care for the elderly. Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont has recently questioned the continuing affordability of policies such as this and others including free prescriptions and the abolition of tuition fees for Scots studying in the country's universities. Mr Salmond claimed both Labour and the Tories were ‘united in a death grip programme to sweep away concessionary travel, free prescriptions and education’. He warned: ‘What was won could now be lost. Have no doubt what was gained with devolution can only now be guaranteed with independence.’","Claimed Government was 'unwilling to do what is best for Scotland'

Distracted: Long hours means six in ten children feel they don't see enough of their mother or father . Children are growing up wishing they could spend more time with their parents, a survey suggests. Six in ten youngsters thought their parents spend too much time away from the family. One in eight parents admitted they give their children their full attention only ‘once or twice a week’. The most hard-pressed said they are never able to focus just on their child. The Family and Parenting Institute, which commissioned the survey, said the findings showed the extent to which pressures on parents’ time affect family life. The charity said British parents work longer hours than those in most European countries and are adding to their workload due to economic uncertainty. The survey findings were released to coincide with Parents’ Week, which starts today. Research firm Childwise interviewed 255 children aged six to ten and one parent of each child. It found that 59 per cent of youngsters wished they could spend more time with their mother or father – rising to three-quarters in London and the south of England. Only four in ten (42 per cent) wanted to spend more time with their friends and even fewer, seven per cent, wanted to do more with their siblings. When parents were asked how much time they spent with their children, just over half (52 per cent) said they were able to give their child their full attention at least once every day. But 13 per cent of parents could devote their full attention only ‘once or twice a week’ and two per cent never could. Parents of the oldest children, ten-year-olds, were most likely to admit being unable to give their full attention to their child more than once or twice weekly. One in five (18 per cent) said this was the level of one-to-one interaction with their children.Nearly two-thirds (64 per cent) of parents believed that the quality of time spent with children was more important than the actual amount. Bedtime story: But 13 per cent of parents admit they can only give their children their full attention once or twice a week . Despite these findings, the survey suggested that parents today spend more time with their children than their own mothers and fathers did. Dr Katherine Rake, chief executive of the Family and Parenting Institute, said: ‘Evidence shows children need dedicated time with their parents if they are to realise their potential. 'It is often the simple things that make a lasting impression on children.’ She called for parents to be given greater flexible working rights. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - .

Marc Capre, 34, allegedly stabbed Davide Loffredo eight times in the back after he went across to the defendant’s side of the room to plug in a hair dryer. Mr Loffredo, 23, left a trail of blood as he frantically tried to flee with Capre continuing to knife him as he followed him into the street outside their home in Murchison Road, Leyton, London, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard. The incident was sparked by a disagreement over where the alleged victim could plug in his hairdryer (file picture) Mr Loffredo then fell to the ground and was stabbed again by Capre, it was said. Horrified onlookers who rushed to help Mr Loffredo saw the tip of his nose was hanging off after the April 27 attack, jurors heard. Mr Loffredo was taken to hospital by air ambulance and treated for life threatening injuries, including a collapsed lung and slashed artery. He was finally discharged from hospital on May 14. Prosecutor Bill McGivern said Capre and his roommate struggled to get on, prompting Mr Loffredo to make a complaint to their letting agents. 'The crown say it was later on that day when he complained about him that the incident took place,’ Mr McGivern told the jury. 'The room had a dividing curtain, which the crown say was something the defendant had set up because he wanted a degree of privacy. 'On that day, Mr Loffredo had gone to have a shower in a separate part of the house. 'Mr Loffredo went to the defendant’s side of the room to use a plug to dry his hair.' Moments later, Capre produced a large kitchen knife and 'went for' his roommate, Mr McGivern said. 'He stabbed him in the shoulder.

Passers-by came to Mr Loffredo’s assistance and one of them noticed the tip of his nose was hanging off, Mr McGivern added. A number of wounds on his back were bleeding quite substantially, the court heard. Capre later handed himself into a nearby police station, throwing the knife on the ground outside. The blade was bent from the force it had been used to stab Mr Loffredo, jurors were told. Capre, who was covered in blood, insisted it was roommate who had started the fight and claimed he was simply trying to defend himself and he panicked. 'The Crown say that far from being self-defence, even if it were, it was clearly excessive, the defendant was the aggressor,’ Mr McGivern added. 'He armed himself with a knife and went for Mr Loffredo. 'Not content with stabbing him in the room, he chased him while he was in the street. 'He stabbed him with considerable force, a man who, at that stage, was injured and lying defenceless on the ground. 'The Crown say that, at that stage, he was intent on killing him.

The San Francisco claimed 'dog lover' Abraham Taylor, 36, was convicted of four misdemeanour counts of animal cruelty after his day care and dog-walking business unearthed four one-year-old skeletal puppies with scabbed skin and scars. 'They were malnourished and left in their own faeces,' District Attorney George Gascón told the San Francisco Examiner adding that the dogs 'couldn't even walk on their own.' Rescued: This one-year-old dog whose ribs, hips and spine are seen protruding from its body was one of four removed from a San Francisco dog daycare center in March . Owner: The daycare's manager Abraham Taylor, 36, was convicted of four misdemeanor counts of animal cruelty and sentenced to 60 days in jail . It was in March Taylor's establishment, Unleashed SF Doggy Daycare in Bayview-Hunters Point was visited by animal care and control officers after an anonymous complaint reporting the dogs' condition. Inside the four black Labrador-Weimaraner mixes were described terrified of human contact with their ribs and hipbones protruding. Taylor's attorney Jo Golub said that he had given the dogs an appropriate amount of food but that they had worms. She said medicine had been administered to the animals just before authorities visited the day care. Gascón called the crime 'disgusting' saying that the dogs doubled their weight within a month of their rescue. Recovering: Within a month the dogs, two pictured, were said to have gained half of their weight while two of the four have since been adopted . On Thursday Taylor, who is still a manager but signed his business over to his girlfriend Allison – who renamed it Allison’s Unleashed at the same location - received his sentence which includes a $880 fine and three years’ probation. During that time he cannot adopt, care for, feed or board animals with the exception of the three dogs he personally owns. Those dogs, they city said, were found in good health. He has additionally been forbidden from adopting any additional dogs. Golub said her client plans to appeal his conviction, calling Taylor a lifelong dog lover. Other dog lovers in the area, however, voiced their upset with his punishment with one calling it a ‘slap on the wrist.’ 'Places like this should be shut down. This guy just got a slap on the wrist,' a Yelp user, one of several who took to its page to downgrade the business and share their own stories, wrote on Friday. ‘I reported prior abuse on Yelp,’ another user wrote. ‘Allison and /or Abe managed to have my report deleted so the public was not warned or informed.

Ramunas Slusnys, 33, drove the luxury vessel as far as a lock before realising he was unable to get through without a booking - so turned around and parked it. He then helped himself to a bowl of cornflakes and drank a bottle of wine on the 48-foot Fairline Phantom craft moored in St Katharine Docks, near Tower Bridge, central London. Jailed: Ramunas Slusnys was given 18 months behind bars after being found guilty of taking the boat - but will be released immediately as he has already served the sentence while on remand . But as he made himself at home on the vessel, owner William Carter was alerted by dock staff who became suspicious and the homeless 33-year-old was arrested. Yesterday he was jailed for 18 months at Snaresbrook Crown Court after a jury unanimously found him guilty of attempted theft of the boat and taking the bottle of wine. However, he is expected to be released as he has already served 10 months behind bars while on remand - the equivalent of a 20 month sentence. Slusnys, who kept his eyes shut for the entire two-day case, was arrested on the vessel on March 28. Piers Wauchope, prosecuting, told the . jury during the case: ‘The question you’ve got to ask yourself is . whether he was trying to steal the boat or whether he was just taking it . without authority. ‘There are two scenarios - one in . which he’s a sort of Lithuanian pirate in the sight of the City of . London, taking a very expensive powerboat or intending to take it. Perhaps this time he was just seeing if he could work it. Attempted theft: The Lithuanian tried to drive off in a 48-foot Fairline Phantom worth £550,000 . ‘The alternative is that he’s little . more than a homeless man, although a homeless man with a knowledge of . boats as few could manoeuvre it in the way he did without causing damage. ‘While he was there, in his desperate . condition, he had some cornflakes and a bottle of wine but he had no . plans and was just messing about.’ Giving evidence, Mr Carter said he had bought the boat as a pleasure craft three months before Slusnys had attempted to take it. He added that the vessel was complex to pilot and it took extensive training to avoid damaging it. James Mehigan, defending Slusnys, of no . fixed address, said boat-owner William Carter had only really lost out . to the tune of a £10 bottle of wine. Passing sentence, Judge Timothy Lamb said it was remarkable that the Lithuanian had not had an accident in the vessel. 'It is miraculous, that having manoeuvred that boat single-handed around St Katherine's dock, that no damage resulted to it, which is also fortunate for you. 'The jury were satisfied that your intention was to make off with this asset worth half a million pounds. Before that theft they found that you stole a bottle of wine which was on the boat. 'I take full account of the fact that you are homeless and you have had problems with your health. Nonetheless, these are serious offences.'","Ramunas Slusnys, 33, jailed for 18 months for attempting to take the vessel .

Around 120 prisoners have escaped from a jail in Libya after security guards allegedly accepted bribed to release them. Libya's Supreme Security Committee said the mass break-out happened at one of the main prisons in the capital city of Tripoli. Spokesman Abdel-Moneim al-Hurr said only two of the 120 have been arrested since their escape from Jdeida prison yesterday. It is the second jailbreak in Tripoli this year. Unrest: The region has been reeling from a security breakdown following an eight-month civil war . Mr Al-Hurr said no security guards were injured during the escape and it is believed guards through the keys into one of the cells. He said: 'We don't know why the policeman threw the keys into the prison. We've been able to catch only seven of the prisoners so far.' Jdeida prison is the biggest jail in Libya and falls under the jurisdiction of the interior ministry. Hurr said the prisoners were in jail for crimes such as murder and rape, many of them were serving sentences issued by judges under the Gaddafi administration. He said: 'This incident shows how weak the police system is in western Libya where we haven't been able to gauge the loyalties of all the security officials working for the government.'

Prisoners claim they have been . languishing in prisons without charge since Libya's uprising. They also . claim the courts have not moved to hear their cases. The North African country has been reeling from a security breakdown and a weakened judiciary following last year's eight-month civil war. The news comes as U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton took responsibility for security at the U.S. consulate in Libya where an attack by extremists last month killed the US ambassador and three other Americans. There are three separate investigations into the attack going on now: an FBI probe into the deaths of the four Americans, an independent inquiry by a panel appointed by Mrs Clinton and the congressional hearings.

Terrorism: Armed groups planned out the September 11, 2012 attack on the consulate that led to the death of Stevens an three other Americans . Ambassador Chris Stevens was among the four killed in the attack, which came on the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in New York and Washington. Pushing back against Republican criticism of the Obama administration for its handling of the situation, Mrs Clinton said in Lima, Peru, that security at all of America's diplomatic missions abroad is her job, not that of the White House. She told CNN: 'I take responsibility. I'm in charge of the State Department's 60,000-plus people all over the world (at) 275 posts. 'The president and the vice president wouldn't be knowledgeable about specific decisions that are made by security professionals.

Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan says he is sorry for the conduct of his employees tied up in the embarrassing Colombia prostitution scandal. At a Senate hearing on the scandal Wednesday, Sullivan apologised 'for the conduct of these employees and the distraction it has caused.' Sullivan testified before Congress for the first time since the scandal erupted in Cartagena, Colombia, in advance of President Barack Obama's arrival for a South American summit in April. Apology: Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan said he was sorry for the conduct of his employees tied up in the embarrassing Colombia prostitution scandal during a hearing today . The woman who brought down the Secret Service: Dania Suarez is pictured during a radio interview about the Secret Service prostitution scandal . Sen Joseph Lieberman said there have been 64 instances of allegations or complaints of sexual misconduct made against Secret Service employees in the last five years. Many of the instances involved employees sending sexually suggestive emails. Three involved charges of inappropriate relationships with a foreign national and one was a complaint of 'non-consensual intercourse,' Sen Lieberman said during his opening statement at the Senate hearing. Lieberman said the allegations were troubling and raised questions about the culture of the agency but the reports did not necessarily show a pattern of wrongdoing by employees. Party: Dania Suarez has said she was swindled by the U.S. agent who agreed to pay her for sex . By the end, Sullivan's job appeared secure even as new details emerged that left little doubt, senators said, that a pattern of sexual misbehavior had taken root in the agency. Sen Susan Collins of Maine, the senior Republican on the Homeland Security panel that heard Sullivan's first public accounting of the episode, said Sullivan 'kept saying over and over again that he basically does think this was an isolated incident and I don't think he has any basis for that conclusion.' Sen Lieberman added: 'For the good of the Secret Service, he's got to assume that what happened in Cartagena was not an isolated incident or else it will happen again.' Still, Sullivan insisted repeatedly that in his 29-year Secret Service career he had never heard anyone say that misconduct was condoned, implicitly or otherwise. 'I just do not think that this is something that is systemic within this organization,' Sullivan said. Investigators have already interviewed the Colombian prostitute at the centre of the affair, Dania Londono Suarez. She said a dispute over payment at the Hotel Caribe in Cartagena led to the April 12 incident becoming public. One man, identified as Arthur Huntington, allegedly agreed on a price of $800 to have sex with Miss Suarez, she said in a recent interview. Shocking revelation: Sen Joe Lieberman, right, says there have been 64 instances of allegations or complaints of sexual misconduct against Secret Service employees in the last five years . She explained that during the transaction she gestured the amount with hand signals and using the words 'sex', 'sexo', 'cash' and dinero' to get the point across. She said the pair had 'normal' sex and then the agent fell asleep, giving her ample opportunity to steal whatever she wanted from his hotel room - which she did not do. The 24-year-old said the next morning, although the man wanted her to stay, she asked for the money they had agreed upon the previous evening - which was when he became 'very angry'. The agent then gave her $50 and closed the door on her. Then police got involved, sparking a Secret Service investigation. Seedy: The U.S. Secret Service agent allegedly took Miss Suarez to his room in Cartagena's Hotel Caribe after agreeing to pay her $800 for sex . A dozen Secret Service officers and supervisors and 12 other U.S. military personnel have been implicated in the incident, which took place before President Obama's visit to the Summit of the Americas. Eight people with the Secret Service, including two supervisors, have been axed from their posts as a result of their involvement. The Secret Service is moving to permanently revoke the security clearance for one other employee, and three others have been cleared of serious wrongdoing. Prostitution is legal in Colombia.

Three decades ago, Ken Kallin began amassing the 120,000 pieces in a memorabilia collection that includes photographs signed by Muhammad Ali and Neil Armstrong along with rare books and trading cards. By the end of Saturday, he’s hoping to have gotten rid of nearly all of it — at an auction to benefit his ailing daughter. Mr Kallin’s daughter suffers from a rare autoimmune disease that makes her bones dangerously brittle and causes her body’s defenses to attack her own blood vessels. Scroll down for video . Everything to go: Memorabilia collector Ken Kallin shows off autographed photos of Ann B. Davis, left, and Betty Davis, at his Oakland Park, Fla. office after three decades of collecting 120,000 pieces . Her treatments are expensive and can involve powerful chemotherapy drugs often used to treat cancer patients. A memorabilia expert who’s not involved in the sale described Mr Kallin’s collection as 'once-in-a-lifetime' and expects the auction to attract big spenders. 'It’s for a higher purpose,' said the 67-year-old Mr Kallin. His daughter, 43-year-old Julie Susi, suffers from mixed connective tissue disorder, or MCTD, which shares features with lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Her brittle bones make it difficult to get around. She walks with a boot on her broken right foot and takes a dozen pills a day to help relieve back and joint pain. She also received chemotherapy treatment for vasculitis, an inflammation of blood vessels. She can’t work and said she and her husband are struggling financially. They have two children, she pays $2,200 a month for their insurance and her deductible is $1,250. 'I’m in a lot of pain,' Susi said. 'Some days are better than others.' Pretty price: Holding up a copy of his autographed Nelson Mandela book Mr Kallin believes his collection could bring in $4.5 million . Benefiting: Money raised from the collection is to go to his daughter, Julie Susi, who suffers a rare autoimmune disease that makes her bones dangerously brittle and causes her body's defenses to attack her own blood vessels . But she also sees the sale as a chance for her father’s private collection to have a public debut that shows the value of his years of collecting. The sale is taking place at a warehouse outside Fort Lauderdale with J. Sugarman Auction Corp. 'I had never looked at this to benefit me. I just want to see my father make it,' she said. Susi said she didn’t bother turning down her father’s offer. He wouldn’t have listened to her anyway. Mr Kallin says he began collecting memorabilia after meeting actress Bette Davis in 1980. By the end of the evening, Davis had given Mr Kallin five photographs with her signature on each. From there, he pieced together his collection by attending golf tournaments and other celebrity appearances, often carrying head shots and other glossy photos to be signed. He scoured garage sales for collectibles. He even bought some items from friends. 'When I started, I said everything I get has to be on an item with their picture on it,' he said. 'Anybody can walk up to a celebrity and get a piece of paper and have them sign it. But to be prepared and to get it on a photo, takes a lot more work. But it’s more viable.' Prized collection: One of Mr Kallni's antique books are seen, one of 680 others and over 22,520 photos that will be auctioned off in Florida on Saturday . Throughout the years, his collection grew to include 22,500-plus original photos with everyone from Michael Jackson to Julia Child and Elizabeth Taylor. Mr Kallin said he researches every photo’s authenticity before including it in the collection by recording every detail from where it came from to its condition. He then follows two dozen other steps before placing the photos in protective plastic covers. 'There is a profit factor here, but if you calculate all of the sacrifices that we’ve made, it’s a return on investment,' said Mr Kallin, who’s earned money with a number of jobs ranging from counseling veterans to helping businesses be more efficient. The collection includes more than 680 antique books; 7,300 or more contemporary books; about 1,430 letters; over 22,520 photos and some 60,740 trading cards — all autographed. He is also selling movie posters, sheet music dating back to 1864, vintage Tin Tin books in French, bowling pins, collectible plates in sets, sports memorabilia and other collectibles. Mr Kallin said he put together the massive collection for personal enjoyment and hasn’t sold pieces of it before. Strangling costs: Mrs Susi, a mother of two, rummages through her medications that cost $2,200 a month through her insurance with her deductible being $1,250 . The collection hasn’t been independently appraised, but the auction house and Mr Kallin believe it’s worth $4.5 million based on valuations for comparable items that have sold recently. Mr Kallin and the auction house also say his books would beat the Guinness World Record for a private collection of autographed books. They’ve asked Guinness to verify the claim, but it hasn’t said whether it will send a judge to the auction. 'I don’t think there’s been a collection like this offered, or featured, in the history of auctions,' said Jay Sugarman, the owner of the auction house. The auction will include a dozen lots divided by category, so the 7,300-plus books will be auctioned as a complete set. Bids can be made online and the auction is expected to last just over an hour. 'That’s a hall of fame caliber collection,' said Neil Whiteley-Ross, who sells trading cards and other items for Bristol Collectibles on eBay. 'That is a once in a lifetime collection that needs to be seen by everyone.' Whiteley-Ross, who isn’t involved in the sale, said the collection should attract some of the biggest spenders in the industry. Mr Kallin is keeping two books by Bob Graham, a former Florida senator and governor, and one photo of Davis, the woman who started it all. 'There’s things that have memories,' he said. 'They are all favorites. They were all like my babies when they came in.' Watch the video here: .","Owner expects will bring in $4.5 million for daughter suffering autoimmune disease .

Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers was warned in the Commons today that the threat downgrade could be 'counter-productive' Ministers were today accused of being ’premature’ in downgrading the terror threat in posed by dissident republicans from Northern Ireland. The Home Office downgraded the threat for Great Britain from substantial to moderate, meaning an attack is possible but unlikely. But Nigel Dodds, the DUP leader in Westminster, warned against any ‘complacency’ by security services. In a statement to MPs, Home Secretary Theresa May said the decision to downgrade was taken by the security service not ministers. She added: ‘Today the Security Service reduced the threat level to Great Britain from Northern Ireland-related terrorism from substantial to moderate. ‘This means that a terrorist attack is possible, but not likely. The threat level to the UK from international terrorism remains at substantial, which means that an attack is a strong possibility. ‘The threat level to Northern Ireland from Northern Ireland-related terrorism remains at severe, meaning that an attack is highly likely. Neither of these two levels has changed.’ However, Mr Dodds told the Commons that many people will be concerned that the downgrade ‘may be both premature and somewhat counter-productive’. DUP leader in Westminster Nigel Dodds warned against the security services becoming complacent . He urged newly-appointed Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers to give an assurance that ‘there won't be any reduction in security or any complacency on the part of the security forces’. Ms Villiers replied that in both Great Britain and Northern Ireland the Government was focused on defeating terrorism and would ‘use all means at our disposal to do that’. Ms Villiers replied: ""I can give him that assurance that we will continue to be vigilant in the face of the continuing threat in relation to Northern Ireland-related terrorism. ‘He will appreciate that the change announced today as he says relates to Great Britain, the threat level in Northern Ireland remains at severe. ‘In both Great Britain and Northern Ireland the Government is focused on defeating terrorism and we will use all means at our disposal to do that.’ Ms Villiers added that her office would ‘certainly be in discussions’ with the chief constable Police Service of Northern Ireland) and the Treasury about extending the £200 million Treasury reserve funding announced in 2010 to help deal with the terrorist threat in Northern Ireland. The threat assessment was increased in September 2010 after Jonathan Evans, the director-general of MI5, warned that dissident Irish republicans could attempt a new wave of terrorist attacks on the British mainland.","Home Secretary Theresa May announced the threat of a Northern Ireland-linked attack in Great Britain was 'possible but unlikely'

James Tindell skipped out of state this spring rather than attend drug treatment and follow other conditions he accepted to avoid prison after pleading guilty to robbery in 2010. But rather do everything possible to avoid detection, he used Facebook to taunt his probation officer and write angry messages about the Multnomah County judge who sentenced him, The Oregonian reported. 'Fresh out of another state,' Tindell wrote April 20, 'Catch me if you can.' Later, he signed a rant about the criminal justice system: 'the 1 who got away.' Facebook flub: Convicted robber James Tindell posted status updates of his whereabouts, which were read by police . Tindell apparently didn't realize who might be reading his Facebook page, with such posts as, 'I'm in Alabama.' He also posted a sonogram of his unborn son that showed the name of the county general hospital in Alabama where it was taken. But probation officer Todd Roberts does monitor the social network and he collected the posts. He figured out where Tindell might be, and asked prosecutors to issue a nationwide arrest warrant, which Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber signed. 'The way we found out where James Tindell was, was through Facebook,' deputy district attorney Michael Schmidt said. 'And, it's not because we were super sleuths.' Last month, Tindell was arrested for speeding in Daphne, Alabama. An officer ran his license and found the warrant. Antisocial network: He was sentenced to two and a half years in jail and must repay the state of Oregon the cost of his flight back . Soon, he was on a flight to appear before the same judge he had criticized on Facebook. 'Mr. Tindell,' Judge Eric J. Bloch said at a June 8 hearing in Multnomah County Circuit Court. 'You turned in some good periods of performance. And then, for whatever reason, you decided that you had had enough, and you just took off, and you never looked back.' Tindell, in tears, pleaded for leniency. Bloch cut him off. 'Sir, you could have stayed here and done treatment. You decided to run away. So how could you now be asking for me to give you another chance to avoid prison? ' Crying, Tindell admitted, 'I messed up.'

A headmaster convicted of sexually abusing his student may lose his court appeal after she filmed them having sex using a spy pen. The now 23-year-old woman was only 14 when she began a sexual relationship with her headmaster, 51, at a school in Bodø, Norway. The pair had a sexual relationship for five years and when he threatened to end it, she decided to gather evidence using a camera hidden in a pen. Caught on tape: The woman filmed them having sex in the headmaster's flat using a pen with a hidden camera . The 51-year-old man was convicted to three-and-a-half years in prison in May this year, but appealed against his sentence. The clips, which were filmed in 2009 and allegedly show sexual encounters between then 19-year-old woman and the headmaster, were brought forward as evidence during yesterday’s proceedings in Hålogaland Court of Appeal, Tromsø. The relationship began in September 2004, when the woman was 14 years old, Norwegian newspaper Avisa Nordland reports. Coming from a troubled home and bullied at school, the 23-year-old says she turned to the only adult she felt she could rely on. She told the court during the May proceedings she agreed to sex a month later because she was scared of losing him. Underage abuse: The relationship began in 2004 when the woman was a 14-year-old student at the headmaster's school in Bodø, Norway . She said: ‘I wasn’t ready. I didn’t want sex; I just wanted someone, an adult, to relate to. I may have fallen in love with my headmaster and teacher. He was a caregiver to me. I was so scared of losing him.‘ . Student and headmaster would meet in school, in his office or places where they would be left alone, she said. They would have sex three times a week, and he made her text him every three hours. She first fell pregnant in 2006 and then second time in 2009, but terminated both pregnancies. By the time of her second pregnancy, both headmaster and student had left the school, but the relationship continued. She was given a key to his apartment, which is where the two sexual encounters were filmed. Convinced he was ‘looking for a new woman’ , she . had bought the spy pen to gather proof of what had been going on. New evidence: The films were shown at Hålogaland Court of Appeal, Tromsø, where the headmaster is trying to get his three-and-a-half-year conviction overturned . The headmaster admits that the two videos were filmed in his flat and that he is the man caught on tape in one of the videos. The clip shows the 51-year-old massaging the woman’s naked upper body. ‘It is the only time anything happened which can be seen as sexual contact’, he said. He denies being the man in the other clip which shows the young woman having sex with a person only visible from the back. ‘It is my flat, yes. But it isn’t me being filmed with her. I don’t know who it is, apart from the fact that I know it's not me. The girl has a key to my flat. She still does.’ The police have found the man’s DNA in the woman’s underwear, to which the headmaster responded: ‘It is amazing how far some people will go to fake evidence. 'She is detailed so she can reinforce her story. She is good at talking and easy to pity.' The accused admits he went travelling around the country and abroad with his former student visiting, London, New York and Sweden.

"By . Graham Smith . UPDATED: . 10:24 EST, 22 December 2011 . A brutal rapist who terrorised a suburb for two decades, preying on elderly and disabled women living alone, has finally been jailed. Michael Roberts, 45, raped three women and viciously attacked a fourth in a spate of attacks in Bermondsey, south London, in the 1980s and early 1990s. Detectives finally caught up with him 15 years later in a cold case review of his crimes. Advances in DNA evidence helped police pinpoint the serial criminal. Guilty: Michael Roberts, 45, has been found guilty of raping elderly women in Bermondsey, south London, during a campaign of terror in the 1980s and early 1990s . Police had long been baffled as to the . identity of the rapist, known as the 'Bermondsey Beast' and also as 'The . Praying Rapist' after a victim recalled him crossing himself and . uttering part of a Catholic prayer. A jury at Southwark Crown Court this week found . Roberts guilty of three charges of rape, four charges of burglary, two . charges of indecent assaults and two charges of causing grievous bodily . harm with intent. His rape victims were aged 57, 66, and 77 and the assault victim was 83. All lived within a short distance of his home. Roberts, . who had a 'substantial criminal record', attacked the 57-year-old woman . so savagely that she was left with a broken jaw and a fractured eye . socket. Forty-six suspects were interviewed . and eliminated. DNA evidence was also collected, but technology was not . advanced enough to use it in identifying the culprit. Roberts was found guilty at Southwark Crown Court of three charges of rape, four charges of burglary, two charges of indecent assaults and two charges of causing grievous bodily harm with intent . Then, in 2005, thanks to new techniques, Roberts was finally identified after a DNA match. At that time, he was serving a life sentence for the brutal robbery and assault of an elderly man in his home in Lee. Detective Inspector Nathan Eason, who led the investigation, today spoke of his relief that Roberts was finally caught. He . said: 'Michael Roberts obviously has no regard for the lives of others, . and picks on those least able to defend themselves in order to steal . their property. 'In the . late 1980s, he went even further by committing vile sexual attacks on . his victims which are beyond most people’s comprehension. 'Thanks to the advances in DNA, Michael Roberts was identified and has been convicted. 'He will have many years in prison to reflect on the suffering he has caused. 'Unfortunately, none of his victims lived to see him finally brought to justice for what he has done.' Dubbed the 'Beast Of Bermondsey', Roberts left elderly women in the south London community (pictured) in fear during the 1980s and 1990s . The . fresh investigation was headed by Detective Chief Inspector Brian . Bowden-Brown, who was brought out of retirement for the case. He knew he had his man when he asked . Roberts to remove his top and found brown marks and moles, which one of . his victims had mentioned to police. Roberts's former neighbours of south London today remembered him as a violent man who they tried to avoid. They said he was frequently abusive towards his girlfriends and the court had heard he had been violent towards two partners. One neighbour said: 'You heard him because they was always fighting. He had the kids screaming - he used to smash the place up. 'He used to count up to ten and, if he got there, he would smash the place up. 'It sounded like wardrobes were coming down the stairs.' Roberts is due to be sentenced on January 12.","Michael Roberts, 45, terrorised Bermondsey, south London, in the 1980s and early 1990s .

Householders face continued confusion over energy bills after watchdog Ofgem announced proposals that watered down David Cameron’s promise to compel companies by law to put customers on the cheapest deals. The power regulator said gas and electricity firms would merely be forced to inform bill payers about the best deals, even if offered by a rival company. It also wants suppliers to offer four tariffs instead of the 558 deals currently available, in an effort to tackle soaring bills that now average £1,300 a year for dual-fuel users. Number Ten yesterday played down the differences between Ofgem’s plan and what the Prime Minister told the Commons on Wednesday. A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘Their proposals will help make bills simpler and easier for consumers. This is complementary with what we are trying to achieve. It is really the same agenda. ‘The Energy Bill will be published in due course and we will take into account the Ofgem proposals.’ Ofgem . said it would look at the Prime Minister’s proposals when they were . published in full, but communications director Ian Marlee said: ‘We . still think that competition is the best way to protect consumers in the . market’. However, Joe . Malinowski, of price comparison website TheEnergyShop.com, said: ‘The . logical conclusion of everyone coming on to one standard tariff is that . there will be losers as well as winners – some people will see their . bills go up.’ He said the one in four customers who currently shop around for deals save up to £190 a year. Mr Cameron insisted he wants to be 'on the side of hard-working families' They could see their bills go up by just over £100 while most of those on standard tariffs would see theirs fall by £34. Energy . firms were left baffled by Ofgem’s plans. Angela Knight, the chief . executive of Energy UK, which represents major suppliers, said: ‘What . they have here is a pretty challenging set of requirements on the . companies and we will work with Ofgem and others, once we have got the . detail, to get what is in the best interests of our customers.’ The Prime Minister’s announcement caught out his ministers, with Energy Secretary Ed Davey distancing himself from the proposal. However, . Mr Davey welcomed Ofgem’s plan: ‘These are the sort of measures I have . been urging for some time.

Disgraced Leeds fan Aaron Cawley's level of alcohol consumption was laid bare as he was jailed for 16 weeks after attacking Sheffield Wednesday's Chris Kirkland on Friday night. In a reminder of the darkest days of hooliganism, the 21-year-old from Cheltenham ran onto the pitch at Hillsborough after his own team scored before violently shoving the keeper to the ground on live television.

The shocking scenes were caught on camera by Sky Sports which was broadcasting the derby game. Cawley wore a blue T-shirt at today's hearing, exposing an 'LUFC' tattoo on his neck and a Leeds United club crest on his right arm. Sheffield Magistrates Court heard the 21-year-old had been the subject of two football banning orders in the past, which he had breached four times. Despite living with his mother in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, he had supported Leeds United all his life and went to every game - home and away, a district judge was told. Prosecutor Paul Macaulay said Cawley told police he was so drunk he could not remember the incident, which has been seen by millions of TV viewers. District Judge Naomi Redhouse heard that Cawley, of Blenheim Square, Cheltenham, only realised what he had done when other people told him and then he saw himself clearly on TV. He emailed the police to say sorry and also emailed Sky Sports in the hope that his apology would be passed on to the two clubs and Kirkland. Pain: Shocked keeper Chris Kirkland fell to the ground after taking the surprise knock to the face as he swore in teh background . His solicitor Elizabeth Anderton asked the district judge to accept that her client pushed Kirkland rather than slapped him. She said Cawley had shown a 'great deal of regret and remorse'. 'It's certainly not something he would ordinarily do,' she said, adding that, as well as drinking a huge amount of alcohol, her client had not eaten before the match. 'He was absolutely disgusted by his own behaviour,' she said. But District Judge Redhouse said she had no choice but to impose an immediate custodial sentence. She said a huge effort had been made to tackle hooliganism in football and 'make football an event where there's no violence and where families are happy to attend with children'. The judge said footballers were at matches as part of their employment and that everyone has the right to be 'protected from being assaulted by a stranger' at work. She also noted that, while she had heard all the evidence about how much Cawley had to drink, she did not see any evidence of his drunkenness on the TV footage she had been shown. Later, Cawley returned to court where he was formally given a six-year football banning order. One of the conditions is for him to stay at least a mile away from football stadiums where Leeds United are playing on match days. He was handcuffed before being led from the dock. Named: Aaron Cawley, seen posing outside the Leeds United ground, pleaded guilty to assault at Sheffield Magistrates' Court today . Trouble: Aaron Cawley had already been banned from entering any football ground in Britain . Cawley was barred from all football matches for five years at the age of 16 . after being caught at the centre of a 200-strong riot at the team's . Elland Road ground. Magistrates subsequently extended the ban to the end of 2013 after the thug repeatedly breached the order. Former England keeper Ben Foster fears a player could one day be confronted by a knife-wielding thug on the pitch. The West Bromwich goalkeeper said: . ‘The guy who interrupted the Boat Race got six months. Why can’t someone . who runs on to the pitch and slaps Chris in the face get at least that? ‘If someone has got it into their . head that they are going to run on to the pitch with the aim of hurting a . player, they will do it — regardless of how many stewards there are. ‘It’s impossible to put a steward . along every metre. You have to trust the fans to behave themselves. I . was watching it and it made me feel sick. 'I wish Chris had  flattened him. I wish he had fronted him up and given him a boot up the a***. But Chris isn’t expecting it. 'He’s been smacked in the face and . didn’t have a clue what was about to happen to him. That lad could have . had a blade. It’s ridiculous if you think of it like that. To be quite . honest, it’s scary.’ Wednesday manager Dave Jones has called on fans to ‘police their own’ in the wake of the attack. Jones, the subject of foul-mouthed . chanting from Leeds fans, told 5 Live’s Sportsweek: ‘It’s a football . match and we’re looking at blaming police and stewards because they’re . not there. He was a hero, he ran in the crowd, they were slapping him on . the back, so what do you do about that? It’s not one person. ‘In this country we seem to end up . going with the minority all the time and it’s going to take the majority . to sort it out. You’ve got to police your own clubs. ‘The people who go to the games who . are disgusted — and it’s going to be hard — they are the ones who should . walk out and isolate or point out the  people there who are doing it. ‘Neil Warnock said I was upset . because I didn’t win the game but Neil must be deaf and blind because . there wasn’t just one person chanting vile stuff.’ Leeds boss Warnock believes the law should make a stand to prevent these incidents from happening. 'Every club has got these fans and . it’s got to start at the very top,’ he said. ‘It’s all right saying, “Go in and . get them out”, but you’ve got to be there. It’s frightening for stewards . — I wouldn’t want to be a steward.’","Television cameras captured the man creeping up behind Sheffield Wednesday goalkeeper Chris Kirkland and shoving him to the ground .

A busy mother of two has invented a back-to-front rucksack that acts as an extra pair of hands to help multi-tasking parents. Mary Campbell, from Falkirk, had got used to cooking with one hand while loading the washing machine with the other, but she was certain there was an easier way. So the ingenious 43-year-old came up with the 'PackaPouch', a simple but effective bag that straps on to the chest of overstretched mothers and fathers. Too many demands: Mary Campbell invented the PackaPouch after she found she had her hands full when trying to cook, clean and keep control of her children Catherine, seven, and Patrick, eight . The cheerful printed leaves harassed mothers and fathers them hands-free to cook, clean or look after children while carrying washing, books or stray toys. Now no matter how many discarded items Mrs Campbell collects as she does the housework, she is ready for any emergency, and the clever rucksack even prevents any strain on the back. Mrs Campbell is now selling the rucksack online and has been granted a Registered Community Design (RCD), which protects her design from duplication within the European Union. 'I found at the end of the day I was . almost crippled after spending all day looking after two young children, . picking up toys, washing clothes and it got to the point where I . couldn’t take it anymore,' said Mrs Campbell. 'I looked around for something that . could help me, something I could attach to me like a backpack but be . able to reach more easily. The 43-year-old can now store toys and washing in the back-to-front bag as she goes about her daily business . Pulled in all directions: Mrs Campbell found it tough to cope with all the demands on her time when Catherine was born and Patrick was just one . 'I looked everywhere and couldn’t find anything suitable, so I decided to invent what I needed. 'I have had a fantastic response and I have sold 20 in my first two weeks and that’s just through word of mouth.' Mrs Campbell, who lives with IT . expert husband Peter, 46, and their two children Patrick, eight, and . Catherine, seven, developed the idea after tying a bedsheet to her . chest to help with the housework, . Following encouragement from her . friends and family, she experimented with different designs and . different material, using old backpacks for fabric, . buckles and netting. She hit on the winning idea earlier this year and has now found a manufacturer to finish her product to a professional standard. All business: The pouch of the bag is positioned high up to prevent any strain on the back - and it is already proving a hit online . The pouch sits high up on the body, to save the constant bending and lifting . associated with washing bundles of children’s clothes. Mrs Campbell added: 'I spent a long time . testing different ideas and showing them to my husband and he would tell . me if he liked them and if he didn’t. 'The pouch is especially useful for . people with back pain. I spoke to some medical experts who said the best . place for it would be high on the chest which limits the movements you . have to take and it is also better for your posture. 'I hope the invention will help . people like me, mothers and fathers. I have also used different material . such as oil cloth and nylon to be used outdoors.' 'I have never done anything like this before but I felt it was something that I needed so I am very pleased with the result.

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 11:22 EST, 25 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:39 EST, 25 October 2012 . A lawyer for James 'Whitey' Bulger has identified the federal official who he says gave the Boston mobster immunity to commit crimes while he was an FBI informant. In court papers filed on Wednesday, former U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts Jeremiah O'Sullivan was named as having granted Bulger immunity for past or future crimes. Bulger's . lawyers said the judge in his case has a conflict of interest because he worked in the U.S. attorney's office in Boston at the same time as . O'Sullivan, who died in 2009. U.S. attorney Jeremiah O'Sullivan (pictured left) allegedly gave Boston mobster Whitey Bulger immunity for past or future crimes when he was an FBI informant . The revelation was made in a defense motion from attorney J.W. Carney for Judge Richard Stearns to recuse himself. Prosecutors have said Bulger never received immunity from anyone. The 83-year-old Bulger is accused of participating in 19 murders and is currently awaiting trial. Bulger has pleaded not guilty to . charges linked to the murders in the 1970s and 1980s, when prosecutors . say he ran the mostly Irish-American gang. He fled Boston in 1994 and remained one of the FBI's most wanted fugitives until his capture in California last year along with his longtime girlfriend Catherine Greig. Greig and Bulger, 82, were arrested on June 22, 2011, in an apartment hideout in Santa Monica, California, blocks from the Pacific Ocean, where they had lived under a number of fake and stolen identities for most of their years on the run. A cache of some 30 weapons as well as more than $800,000 in cash was hidden in a hole in the wall. Bulger, the former leader of the Winter Hill Gang, was also an FBI informant. Identification: Identification cards, including Social Security and AARP, are seen identifying Bulger as pseudonym Charles Gasko . His girlfriend Ms Greig, 61, was sentenced to eight years in March after being charged with conspiracy to harbor a fugitive, conspiracy to commit identity fraud, and identity fraud. Prosecutors had sought 10 years in prison while her attorney had recommended 27 months. The . accused mob boss fled Boston in 1994 after getting a tip from a corrupt . FBI agent that authorities were closing in on him. Greig joined Bulger a . few weeks later. Bulger's . trial is scheduled to start on November 5 although his lawyers have . said they need more time to sift through hundreds of thousands of pages . of evidence. Bulger's case inspired Martin Scorsese's 2006 Academy Award-winning film 'The Departed.' Bulger got his start in crime robbing banks and when he ended up in prison for nine years, he studied military tactics and strategies, according to Massachusetts police officer Thomas Foley who chronicled his decades' long hunt for Bulger in his book Most Wanted. Bulger was able to evade capture for almost 50 years thanks to the help of the FBI, according to Mr Foley. Bulger would tip off the agency on rivals in exchange for not being arrested, despite a $2 million tag on his head. John Connolly, one of the FBI agents who helped Bulger, is now serving a forty-year prison sentence.

"9,513 items of clothing are disposed of every five minutes . Louise Roe and Zara Martin join Oxfam and M&S to help combat this . By . Bianca London . PUBLISHED: . 10:43 EST, 10 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:24 EST, 10 September 2012 . With a new season comes a new wardrobe and many fashionistas live by the motto 'out with the old and in with the new.' The seasonal shift is often the catalyst for many to clear their summer . wardrobes to get rid of last season's trends and make space for new garments. But unbeknown to many, a staggering 9,513 items of clothing are disposed of every five minutes by the British public. Marks and Spencer have joined with Oxfam to encourage women to recycle their old clothes . So, in charitable fashion, high-street giant Marks and Spencer have joined forces with Oxfam to launch a campaign which aims to end the disposal of this many clothes. 'Shwopping' is the revolutionary . sustainable fashion initiative created by M&S and Oxfam, asking . consumers to adopt a ‘buy one, give one’ mentality when shopping and . encourage greater sustainability on the high street. The campaign aims to put an end to . the one billion items currently ending up in landfill every year. All M&S clothing stores now . accept used and unwanted items of clothing from any brand, all year . round with items going to Oxfam to be resold, re-used or recycled. The campaign aims to put an end to the one billion items currently ending up in landfill every year . The partners have enlisted the help of two ‘Queens of Style’ to help the British public clear out their wardrobe ahead of the new autumn season and encourage them to give their unwanted items of clothing a future life through the retailer’s shwopping initiative. US Glamour magazine’s Fashion Editor-at-Large, Louise Roe and TV presenter Zara Martin have each given a clear step-by-step guide to consumers to give their wardrobe a diet and help the environment at the same time. Louise Roe said: 'Be brutal, throw out anything you haven’t worn in two years or more. If you haven’t been attracted to it in that long, you never will be – but someone else might!' Zara Martin sent a clear message to those thinking that they will one day fit into their treasured old items again: 'It doesn't fit anymore, move on.' Past ‘on trend’ items of clothing have also been dealt a blow with Roe stating: 'Any trends that you wore the first time that they were in fashion (i.e. 70’s flares, 80’s shoulder pads) rarely work again on you decades later, unless it’s a timeless evening piece.' Martin added: 'You tried the trend. RIP. Now, remove the remnants.' Louise Roe gives her top tips on how to be brutal with your clothes . Spend a Sunday afternoon . giving your wardrobe some rehab- you can't do this half-heartedly. So get the whole lot out on your bed and buy new hangers, drawer . separators, boxes to label, it'll feel like a totally fresh start and . you might find some hidden gems . Throw out anything you . haven't worn in two years or more. If you haven't been attracted to it . in that long, you never will be. If a garment is two or more . sizes too small or too big - chuck it. You don't need visual reminders . of how skinny or chubby you used to be. Better to love dressing the body . you have now! Don't be too sentimental. Of . course, hang onto anything that makes you well up at the thought of . losing it, but clinging onto garments because they remind you of . ex-boyfriends or drunken nights at university, are just not worth it. Any trends that you wore the . first time that they were in fashion (ie. 70's flares, 80's shoulder . pads) rarely works again on you decades later, unless it's a more . timeless evening piece. I hate to be brutal, but if you were rocking . bright eye shadows and neon’s in the 80's, you shouldn't be rocking them . out again now! 'If it doesn't fit anymore, move on' says Zara Martin . Stop being a hoarder:  If you have . clothing with the labels still on it hanging in your closet, the general . rule is you're probably never going to wear it. Admit it was a mistake . and get rid. It doesn’t fit anymore, move . on: We all have a pair of jeans lurking somewhere deep within our . wardrobes that we wish we could still fit into - 'Inspiration jeans', if . you will. In reality, they serve as a constant reminder of the good . times (before we discovered Krispy Kreme). Say bye-bye, embrace the ones . that do fit AND the booty! Stick to what you know: You tried the Bo-Ho (insert equivalent) 'trend'. RIP. Now, remove the remnants. Quality, not quantity: One . well-cut jacket is infinitely better than 3-5 mediocre ones. Invest in . quality, timeless pieces that you can enjoy wearing over and over again. There are no seasons: We live . in the UK. Bummer for us that summer looks like winter and vice versa. Do you really need another pair of short-shorts?","9,513 items of clothing are disposed of every five minutes .

A schoolboy was stabbed to death in a horrific attack filmed on his own mobile phone, a court heard. Leroy James, 14, was allegedly ambushed with a four-inch blade as he brawled with another teenager in a north London park. His 15-year-old attacker produced the knife - which he had christened his pet ‘alligator’ - from his pocket and plunged it into the victim’s heart, the Old Bailey was told. In the days before the killing, he had threatened friends of Leroy using Facebook and boasted on violence he was planning towards others from his victim’s area, jurors heard. He is even said to have bragged to a friend: ‘If you see me on road ... and I have my right hand in my pocket dat means I have a knife.’ Jurors were played a shocking 15-second clip of the killing in Ponders End Recreation Ground in Enfield, north London, last August 18 on the first day of the murder trial. Prosecutor Duncan Penny told them: 'As, most regrettably, you will see when you watch these very events on video-recorded footage - of all ironies from the camera on the mobile telephone of the dead boy - the killer did indeed have his right hand in his pocket just prior to the fatal act as the dead boy, Leroy James, aimed his first unarmed punch. 'And when that hand was in due course produced from that pocket, it was thrust to the chest of Leroy James, no doubt containing the blade which [the alleged attacker] had been concealing.’ Dressed in a white T-shirt, Leroy can be seen falling to the floor in the footage, amid shouts of, 'You’ve bored him'. He handed his mobile phone to a female friend seconds before the stabbing. Family tragedy: Left, grieving Leroy James . senior had to comforted by friends as he visited the scene where his 14-year-old . son, right, was stabbed to death . Investigation: A forensics tent was set up . in Ponders End Recreation Ground . The victim and his attacker, who . cannot be named, squared up in an area of the park known as 'The Gym', . which contained exercise equipment arranged in the pattern of the 2012 . Olympic logo, jurors heard. 'But . what unfolded that afternoon on the London 2012 logo, just less than a . year before London’s games, in no way reflected Olympic ideals to be . celebrated in this city in coming weeks,' said Mr Penny. 'For while there was violence, it did not proceed according to Queensberry rules. 'To those who were watching what was expected to be a fist fight transpired to be anything but.' Leroy, a pupil at the Aylward Academy in nearby Edmonton, was pronounced dead by paramedics at the scene, despite the efforts of an air ambulance crew. A post-mortem examination gave the cause of death as a single stab wound to the heart. The alleged killer harboured 'ill feeling' towards Leroy and the 'N9 guys' - a reference to the north London postcode area including Lower Edmonton - and had posted messages about buying guns to kill them, the court heard. He fled the scene immediately after the stabbing and headed for a friend’s house, where he confessed to the killing, jurors were told.

Kelli's funeral took place just a few miles away at St. John of the Cross Church in Western Springs, Chicago at around the same time, with mourners lining the road as her coffin passed by. It was also revealed today that a local police officer stopped Wilson Jr, who was out on parole for armed robbery when the killing took place, on the night of the murder but had no cause to arrest him. Scroll down for video . Murder: John L Wilson Junior, 38, right, is in court today charged with the first-degree murder of 14-year-old Kelli O'Laughlin, left, in her suburban Chicago home . Leafy: Wilson Jr allegedly sent taunting text messages to Kelli's mother from the girl's cell phone after the killing at their $500,000 house, pictured . Homicide: Kelli O'Laughlin,was remembered by school friends as a happy, fun girl who always wore a smile . The 38-year-old, whose last known address is on South Lafayette Avenue in Chicago, was taken into custody on Wednesday afternoon, six days after the killing at the O'Laughlin's $500,000 family home in Indian Head Park. Today Judge Peter A. Felice ordered Wilson Jr, who has spent 17 years of the last two decades behind bars, be held without bond during an appearance at the Cook County courthouse in Bridgeview. Wilson Jr was dressed in a grey sweatshirt that covered his arm tattoos and said nothing during the hearing, in front of a packed courthouse, the Chicago Sun Times reported. Those in attendance were told how last Thursday Wilson Jr entered the O'Laughlin's leafy neighbourhood and broke a dining room window of their $500,000 home with a rock wrapped in a red knit cap. When popular Lyons Township High School freshman Kelli arrived home around 3.40pm, 'she was confronted by John Wilson,' Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez said at a news conference. Wilson Jr grabbed an eight inch carving knife from a butcher's block and stabbed Kelli in the neck, back and chest, before dragging her dead body from the family room into the kitchen, Ms Alvarez said, accordingh to the Chicago Tribune. He then ransacked the home and fled with a bowl of coins, an iPod Touch and Kelli's phone. The knife was found in large pool of blood in the family. She was discovered by her mother Brenda at around 5.30pm. In the hours after the murder, Wilson Jr used the phone to send 'taunting and disturbing' messages to Kelli's mother. 'There are no words to describe how horrific it is,' Ms Alvarez said. She would not reveal the exact nature of the taunts.

She found her daughter dead . Assistant State’s Attorney Peter Troy said the messages to Kelli's mother Brenda came within hours of her daughter's murder. He said: 'A horrific crime was committed here, and then to have the mother of the victim subject to taunts by the person who did it ... I can’t describe it.' 'To me that doesn't sound like a . random burglary,' Marie Raleigh told Fox News Chicago. ' I'm a little . bit concerned that someone could be so vicious and cruel as to do that . to the family of this victim. Kelli didn't deserve that and neither did . her family.' 'The United States Secret Service was able to track the defendant’s cellphone and Kelli’s cellphone,' Mr Troy said, according to the Chicago Tribune. 'The agents learned these two phones travelled in tandem with one another throughout the city of Chicago.' Wilson Jr was located Wednesday on the South Side. When found, he had his phone but not Kelli's, the Chicago Tribune reported. DNA recovered from the knit cap matched Wilson Jr, Alvarez said. Three witnesses identified Wilson in a line-up, she said. Wilson Jr has an extensive history of criminal violence, including a combined nine years spent in prison for carjacking in 1993 and aggravated battery in 2001. His most recently received an 11-year sentence for robbert. He was taken into custody in August 2002 and paroled on November 16, 2010, the Chicago Tribune reported.

Kelli's funeral will take place in Western Springs, Chicago this morning . Plans: Kelli had spoken of growing up in that day's Spanish class, friends said . Suburban home: Kelli was discovered by her mother in the 6300 block of Keokuk Road, Indian head Park, a suburb of Chicago . He . said he was walking in the area because his car had broken down and he . needed a cab, leaving the officer no cause to arrest him. That . officer was then off work for several days, Fox News Chicago reported, . and only saw the composite sketch of the suspect when he returned to . service recently. He . reportedly identified Wilson Jr as the man in the drawing, which depicts . a black man, 5'8"" to 5'9"" inches tall, with a medium build. He was was . seen in the area at the time wearing a dark, hooded sweatshirt and had a . backpack. Police then . traced the driver of the cab the suspect got into after being stopped by . the officer at a 7-11 in Willow Springs, for miles from the murder . scene. Investigators arranged for a line-up, in which Wilson Jr was positively identified, Fox News Chicago reported. The . unsuspecting taxi-driver took the suspect to Midway airport where the . man paid for his fare with coins. These were not the special gold coins . taken from the victim's home however.

A thug high on cannabis ripped a veil off the face of a Muslim woman in a violent unprovoked rage because the movie he wanted to see was not being shown, a court heard today. Ian Brazier, 26, tore off 26-year-old Farhana Chughtai's Niqab in the middle of a busy shopping centre in Solihull, West Mids. in front of her shocked family. Brazier today pleaded guilty to one charge of racially aggravated common assault by beating at Solihull Magistrates Court - and is facing a maximum sentence of two years in prison. Guilty plea: Ian Brazier, 26, leaves court after pleading guilty to one charge of racially aggravated common assault . The court heard Miss Chughtai - who . was not present at the hearing - was with her family in the Touchwood . Shopping Centre on March 3 when she felt her . hair being tugged from behind. Prosecutor . John McCann told the court Brazier then tore Miss Chughtai’s veil off . her head leaving her face exposed - a major taboo in Islam. He . said: 'The complainant was wearing the Niqab, walking through the . shopping centre on a Saturday afternoon with other family members. 'She felt a tug to her hair from the back and shortly afterwards felt the Niqab come away from her face . 'She turned to see this defendant, a complete stranger, standing behind her. 'She felt humiliated and very upset. 'There was clearly no injury, the pull on the hair is the assault. 'It . is clearly racially aggravated because of the nature of the assault and . the removal of this particular item of clothing by this defendant.' Facing jail: Jobless Brazier faces a possible two-year jail sentence . Jobless builder Brazier ran off but was caught after he was spotted fleeing the scene on CCTV. He initially gave a ‘no comment’ interview but returned to a police station and made a full confession. Habib . Ahmed, defending, said Brazier had headed to the shopping centre’s . cinema after smoking cannabis for the first time that day. He . said: 'When his second choice film was also not showing, Brazier became . angry and directed his anger towards the first person he saw, who . happened to be Miss Chughtai. 'He had smoked cannabis for the first time that day, and had not anticipated the effect it would have on him. 'He was clearly upset and decided to leave. 'Mr Brazier holds no hostility to anyone wearing the Niqab on a day-to-day basis.' Brazier has pleaded guilty to racially aggravated common assault after the incident which took place at Touchwood Shopping Centre in Solihull (pictured) Brazier, from Shirley, West Mids., was bailed and ordered to return to court for sentencing on July 4. The maximum sentence for racially aggravated common assault by beating is two years in prison. Magistrate Tony Tindall told Brazier: 'We believe that the immediate effect of your actions on the victim and the racial humiliation that she suffered were the key points in this particular offence.''It was carried out in a public place, namely Touchwood Shopping Centre, and while you were under the influence of drugs, which are clearly aggravating matters.”Brazier refused to comment outside court.","Ian Brazier, 26, had smoked cannabis for the first time before attacking Farhana Chughtai, 26 .

Kent County Council . A council chief who lasted just 20 months in her job was given a £589,165 pay-off, the local authority has been forced to admit. Katherine Kerswell left Kent County Council in December. The council had refused to disclose . details of the settlement, saying it was subject to a confidentiality . agreement. But it was forced to declare the sum under new transparency . rules on executive pay. Its Conservative administration . insisted at the time that her departure was part of a cost-saving . reorganisation. But there was also speculation she had fallen out with colleagues and . councillors. It is thought to be one of the highest . ever remuneration packages for a council manager, and is more than four . times the Prime Minister’s £142,500 salary. The statement of accounts for 2011-12 . revealed that Mrs  Kerswell, 49, received £139,806 of her £197,000 . salary, £420,000 in redundancy payments and a £29,359 pension . contribution. Robert Oxley, campaign manager of the . TaxPayers’ Alliance, said the council had shown ‘scant regard’ to value . for taxpayers’ money. He added: ‘Councils may have a legal requirement . to make a redundancy pay-out, but this is staggeringly excessive. ‘Councillors need to scrap the overly . generous contracts that make these deals possible before any more money . is blown on gargantuan redundancy pay-offs.’ Expensive business: Kent County Council headquarters. A total of £10.08million has been paid in 'exit packages' to staff between 2011 and 2012 . Mrs Kerswell had a £197,136 salary in . her previous job as chief executive of Northamptonshire County Council. She had defended the pay deal by saying it was equal to only 29p for . each person in the county. She was also lampooned at the time for . her ‘Taste the Strawberry’ campaign – management speak that was meant . to represent the overall ‘flavour’ of the council’s services and help it . to improve its performance. She moved to Kent in March 2010 and oversaw . a shake-up of the way the county council was run under its ‘Change To . Keep Succeeding’ programme, which involved a cull of senior directors. Kent County Council, which needs to . make savings of £97million this year, paid out £10.8million in so-called . ‘exit packages’ to about 1,000 staff in 2011-12. This included £172,000 . to the authority’s former finance director, Lynda McMullan, who left in . September last year and now works for the National Audit Office. History: The council gave the chief executive who Ms Kerswell replaced a £200,000 pay off . Council leader Paul Carter said: ‘Removing chief executive posts is what more and more councils should be doing. ‘Employment law and contractual . obligations mean we have to pay significant redundancy costs, but it . will save a fortune in the long run. Our council is now being guided by . officers who have worked their way up and know what life is like from a . Kent taxpayer’s perspective.’ Last year it emerged that Phil Dolan, . the former chief executive of South Somerset District Council, which has . just 162,000 residents, had received a redundancy package of almost . £570,000. The transparency rules which forced the council to reveal Mrs Kerswell’s pay were introduced by the Coalition government. Local Government Minister Grant Shapps . last night criticised Mrs Kerswell’s pay deal as ‘deeply concerning’. He said: ‘I find dipping into the public purse to make such an . eye-watering pay-off unacceptable.’","Former chief exec had led major shake-up of the way .

The end of slavery in the United States led to anarchy and the deaths of hundreds of thousands of black Americans claims a new revisionist history of the Civil War. Instead of a granting former slaves a glorious moment of freedom, President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation condemned millions to a life of disease and hunger says historian Jim Downs in his new book, 'Sick from Freedom'. Scouring through obscure records, Professor Downs has revealed that freed slaves were subject to outbreaks of cholera and smallpox as they attempted to start new lives for themselves and that thousands starved to death. Slave Family In Cotton Field near Savannah, Georgia in 1860: A new book has shed new light on the struggles of freed slaves in the U.S. after the end of the Civil War . Writing about the period of 1862 to 1870, Professor Downs claims that one million of the four million salves former slaves freed by Lincoln's 1863 executive order died or got sick. This number includes at least 60,000 who lost their lives in a smallpox epidemic that started in Washington and spread to the south as black Americans left their former slave-masters in order to find work. Calling this 'the largest biological crisis of the 19th century', Downs states that this tragedy has failed to be acknowledged because it does not match with the rosy view of the Civil War being a fight between the Unionist North and Confederate South for God-given rights. Professor Jim Downs new revisionist history of the Civil War and Emancipation Proclamation claims that a million black Americans suffered hunger and died following the end of slavery . 'The freed people we want to see are the ones with all their belongings on the wagon, heading towards freedom,' said David W. Blight, a professor of history at Yale to the New York Times. 'But the truth is, for every person making it there may have been one falling by the way.' As the anniversary of President Lincoln's order approaches, Mr. Downs, 39, is part of new school of thought re-addressing commonly held beliefs about the history of emancipation. 'We're getting ready to celebrate 150 years of the movement from slavery to freedom,' said Professor Downs to the New York Times. 'But hundreds of thousands of people did not survive that movement.' In fact in the years following 1863, the public health problems that freed slaves experienced attempting to set up their own homes, getting jobs and feeding their families seemed so intense that some historical observers wondered whether all black Americans might die. In 1863, one white religious figure . wrote, 'Like his brother the Indian of the forest, he must melt away and . disappear forever from the midst of us.' While . the accepted view is that the Unionist North was sympathetic to the . plight of all southern slaves, Professor Downs feels that there was in . fact an element of turning a blind eye to the problems the newly freed . people experienced. 'In the 19th century people did not want to talk about it,' said Professor Downs to the Observer. 'Some . did not care and abolitionist, when they saw so many freed people . dying, feared that it proved true what some people said: that slaves . were not able to exist on their own.' Harriet Tubman (far left), was an American abolitionist and she is photographed with a group of slaves she helped escape in the 19th century . A family of former slaves outside their ramshackle house in Fredericksburg, Virginia in 1865 . A group of freed slaves gather on the plantation of Confederate General Thomas F. Drayton in Hilton Head, South Carolina, during the Union occupation of the property in 1862 . Professor Jim Downs has written 'Sick from Freedom' which takes a fresh look at the continued racism which freed black Americans encountered in the U.S. in the years following the end of the Civil War . Professor Downs paints a desperate . picture of freed families staggering away from southern plantations and . finding themselves in Union run 'contraband camps' struggling for food . and living in unsanitary conditions. His . book points out the irony that these camps were sometimes no better . than the freed slaves previous living conditions and that the only way . out was to offer to return to the same plantations from which they had . escaped. In 'Sick from . Freedom' Professor Downs recounts the tragic story of one former slave, . Joseph Miller, who arrived at a union camp in Kentucky with his wife and . four children in 1864 and watched them all die within months, before he . died in 1865. During his research, Professor Downs discovered the horrific conditions within what were essentially refugee camps doted around the south. A military official with the Union army wrote that life for the former slaves was so appalling that they were: 'dying by scores - that sometimes 30 per day die and are carried out by wagon-loads without coffins, and thrown promiscuously, like brutes, into a trench.' Not wishing to cast aspersions on the . Emancipation Proclamation, for which Professor Downs still holds its . true moral value, he nonetheless wants to bring a fuller picture to the . public. 'I've been alone with these people in the archives,' said Professor Downs. 'I have a responsibility to tell their stories.'","President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation gifted freedom to four million black Americans in 1863 .

But as the term at Cambridge University ended, the occasion became just another chance to get hopelessly drunk and frolic in the streets. As the sun came up this morning, throngs of the young and wealthy scions staggered through the streets of the city following the lavish Trinity May Ball. Scroll down for video . Pased out: A student in a dinner jacket lies on the pavement after too much to drink at the May Trinity Ball . Frivolous: Girls clad in elegant gowns snigger and drunkenly dance their way through the streets of Cambridge . Defiant: One female student, who refused to dress in the elitist style, blows a raspberry at the photographer as a group of fellow scholars stagger out of the £215-a-ticket ball in the early hours of the morning . Wearing dinner jackets and top hats, some of the men passed out in pavements while others teetered home with no trousers on following the £215-a-ticket event. Binge-drinking has become an age-old ritual at Cambridge and there are even special drinking societies that organise debauched events like: . Caesarean Sunday is seen as the birth of the drinking parties for the summer term. It historically included members of Girton and Jesus colleges’ drinking society takes place at a park in Cambridge’s city centre, on the first bank holiday of the summer term. This year thousands of students got drunk, exposed themselves and fought. Suicide Sunday: The party at Cambridge University is a traditional event in which hundreds of students celebrated finishing their exams. Three years ago the Suicide Sunday garden party, organised by the Wyverns, an all-male Magdalene College drinking society, had to be held in a new location for the first time in 80 years after officials banned students from holding the event on university . VT valley rally: Its winter equivalent, the VT valley rally, occurs during the annual Varsity ski trip, is quickly catching up to Suicide Sunday’s levels of debauchery. Last year female students stripped to their underwear in front of hundreds of onlookers, while both men and women simulated sex acts with each other.Wyverns drinking society . The Wyverns drinking society has a reputation for its hard partying and excessive drinking.Its initiation ceremony involves eating a 15-course meal with delicacies such as a pig’s snout with wasabi sauce and a pint of water with a goldfish swimming inside. The Ferret drinking society: The Ferretz, an inter-collegiate drinking society, must consume 80 units on their initiation. They usually start with a bottle of gin and finish off with a bottle of port - consumed through a condom. Girls are also encouraged to kiss strangers. Some were seen hurling abuse at passersby . and fighting with security staff as they desperately tried to save the . last morsels of their champagne and beer. One unsavoury student was even seen flashing his penis in the street and laughing at his own loutish behaviour. The women, who - like their male counterparts – were mostly educated at expensive public schools before arriving at Cambridge, were not much more dignified. Some had to be carried back to their rooms by boyfriends, while others sniggered as they lurched through the same streets once trodden on by eminent scholars like Isaac Newton. Others continued to celebrate at the expensive end-of-term party with drunken punt rides on the River Cam and a champagne breakfast in the college gardens. The sold-out ball is the largest event of . the Cambridge student social calendar and the coveted tickets cost a . staggering £430 a couple.

Students . could tuck in to oysters, hand-made crepes, a hog roast and a cascading . chocolate fountain, while drinks were served from a floating punt on . the river. They could also opt for luxury spa treatments, a gamble at the casino or relaxing in the jazz tent. The night was brought to a close with a spectacular fireworks display. One . reveller said: 'It was a brilliant night we had copious amounts of . champagne and we all really enjoyed ourselves. Its just a great bit of . fun.' Trinity May Ball is held on the first Monday of May Week, which, despite the month in the title, always takes place in June after exams. The first one was held in 1838 when 38 .

Backer: Government funding for the Affordable Medicines Facility for malaria was signed off by the Department for International Development while Andrew Mitchell was in charge . A foreign aid programme receiving more than £70million in Government cash to fight malaria is ‘a dangerous distraction’, according to a damning report by Oxfam. The charity wants funding withdrawn and says the scheme, which aims to boost provision of malaria medication in Africa, fails to help those most in need. Oxfam’s concerns follow renewed criticism of the Department for International Development over the billions it is pouring into overseas aid. International Development Secretary Justine Greening is to examine every aid contract worth more than £1million in a bid to tackle waste. The UK is one of the main financial backers of the Affordable Medicines Facility for malaria, which hopes to boost the circulation of the most effective anti-malaria medication by subsidising private sector suppliers. But Oxfam says selling medication ‘excludes poor people’ and that treatments are not reaching those who are most at risk of dying from the mosquito-borne disease. The Government has spent £71.6million on the AMFm project since it was launched in 2009. It contributed £40million during the first two years followed by £31.6million last year. Funding for the past two years was signed off while Andrew Mitchell –who resigned as Chief Whip last week – was in charge of the DfID. Oxfam says the programme, which is administered by The Global Fund and is being piloted in seven countries including Kenya, Ghana and Nigeria, should be abandoned. The charity admits the programme has led to increased distribution  of medicine but says it distracts from more effective solutions. Oxfam’s senior health policy advisor, Doctor Mohga Kamal Yanni, said: ‘There is no cheap option or short cut to combat malaria. Support: Funding for the scheme was approved while Mr Mitchell was International Development Secretary . ‘The AMFm is a dangerous distraction from genuine solutions like investing in health workers. The Global Fund must act on the evidence and put a stop to the AMFm now.’ The scheme is also backed by UNITAID, an international drug-purchasing body; the Canadian government; and Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates’s charitable foundation. A DfID spokesman said: ‘Studies have shown that drugs have got to remote areas and more vulnerable groups are now being reached.’ The Global Fund defended the programme and a spokesman said: ‘Some Western aid groups oppose a pragmatic approach that includes any involvement of the private sector. ‘But the reality of this programme is that it is getting life-saving medicine to people who need it most from the private sector outlets where they already seek treatment. ‘To call that a health risk is simply untrue.’ UK aid spending is due to rise from £8billion a year to £12billion in order to hit a target of 0.7 per cent of GDP.

Jersey should 'be ready to become independent' in the wake of a slew of political attacks and crackdowns on its tax schemes, a senior politician said today. Sir Philip Bailhache, the island's assistant chief minister, wants officials to begin preparations for severing its links with the UK because the largest of the Channel Islands is getting a 'raw deal'. Prime Minister David Cameron last . week branded comedian Jimmy Carr 'morally wrong' for pumping millions into Jersey-based . company K2 to avoid paying tax. Row: Sir Philip Bailhache, pictured with the Queen, wants officials to begin preparations for severing links with the UK . The people of Scotland are already set to vote on independence from the UK in 2014. Jersey is suffering increasingly strained relations with Westminster and its government claims over the last five years MPs have made it 'very plain' they want to damage its economy. For decades its relaxed laws drew in the rich and big business because of its tax set-up, but since the financial crisis successive UK governments have fought to clampdown on banks and tax avoidance, hitting Jersey badly. This was further compounded when Jersey and Guernsey lost their High Court bid in March to stop the Treasury scrapping a tax loophole that allowed the Channel Islands to sell DVDs and CDs VAT-free. Battle: The picturesque islands have become a tax haven for the rich and big business but the British Government is fighting that . 'I feel that we get a raw deal. I feel it's not fair. I think that the duty of Jersey politicians now is to try to explain what the island is doing and not to take things lying down,' Sir Philip said in an interview with the Guardian. 'The island should be prepared to stand up for itself and should be ready to become independent if it were necessary in Jersey's interest to do so. 'I hope that the constitutional relationship with the UK will continue. But if it becomes plain that our interests in fact lie in being independent it doesn't seem to me that we should bury our head in the sand and say we're not going to do that.' Scandal: Jimmy Carr invested in a Jersey-based tax scheme and islanders fear this could make the situation even worse . Despite being largely self-governing and not officially part of the UK or the EU, it is not independent from Britain. And the Coalition has tried to clamp down hard on its tax affairs to drag more revenue into the Treasury. In his last budget Chancellor George Osborne told MPs: 'I regard tax evasion – and, indeed, aggressive tax avoidance – as morally repugnant,'  and said he would close loopholes related to offshore pensions and VAT-free websites - hitting Jersey hard. Civil servants have been asked build new anti-avoidance laws, many of which would also hurt the island's economy. Bailhache has said that Jersey would have to deal with the moral outrage in Britain over tax avoidance but would also have to get a fair deal. Another senior politician said that the island was in huge danger of being unfairly hit because Jimmy Carr's investment in Jersey has become so high profile. 'The UK tax code is horrifically complicated. It has all sorts of exemptions and allowances and schemes – and that's fertile ground for tax avoiders,' he told the Guardian. And in the face of this vitriol Jersey has opened offices in London and Washington DC for the first time as well as hiring PR specialists Brunswick to improve their image. Bailhache, who is also in charge of Jersey's international relations, added: 'We want to educate. We want to explain what the island is doing. 'We understand that the movement is towards collecting as much tax as the UK legitimately can do and it's not part of our function to help UK citizens to avoid paying their dues in the UK.' Jersey has an interesting and sometimes violent history, changing hands several times in the past 1,000 years or so. It was conquered by the Vikings in the ninth century and eventually claimed by the Normans in 933. When William the Conqueror took England from King Harold at Hastings the islands first became linked to Britain. Two centuries later King John lost all his territories in mainland Normandy, and the islands, in 1204. But Jersey and the Channel Islands decided to become Crown dependencies and have been loyal to the English monarchy . ever since, despite several skirmishes and invasions. In 1781, at the height of tensions . between France and Britain, a French invasion force of 2,000 tried to . take over the island but failed. During World War II, Jersey was . occupied by Nazi Germany for nearly five years between July 1 1940 until . May 9 1945. Russian slaves were brought there to fortify it and it was . one of the last parts of Europe to be freed from German tyranny.","'We are getting a raw deal,' says Sir Philip Bailhache, the island's assistant chief minister .

China's ruling Communist Party could be heading for reform after subtly dropping references to the county's late leader Mao Zedong from two policy statements. Mao has always been held up as an ideological great in party communiques, his name mentioned almost by default in homage to his role in founding modern China and leading the Communist Party, whose rule from the 1949 revolution remains unbroken. Which is why the dropping of the words 'Mao Zedong thought' from two recent statements by the party's elite Politburo ahead of a landmark congress, at which a new generation of leaders will take the top party posts, has attracted so much attention. Also absent were normally standard references to Marxism-Leninism. Changing times: A guard posted at the Tiananmen Gate of the Forbidden City in Beijing stands in front of a portrait of Mao Zedong, and a placard to the glory of China. But some think the country could be heading for reform after subtly dropping references to Mao Zedong from two policy statements . The omission in the latest statement by the powerful decision-making body on Monday, revealing that the congress next month would discuss amending the party's constitution, has been seen by some as sending a signal about its intent on reform. One of the constitution's key platforms is Mao thought. 'It's very significant,' Zheng Yongnian, the director of the East Asian Institute at the National University of Singapore, said of the removal of a reference to Mao Zedong Thought and the implications of that for the direction leaders were taking. The wording has in the past talked about 'holding high the banner of Mao Zedong thought and Marxism-Leninism' in carrying out the party's work, and is often included at the end of statements almost as a mantra. But the latest two statements mentioned only that the party should follow 'Deng Xiaoping theory', the 'three represents' and the 'scientific development concept'. Late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping introduced the idea that China can be both communist and have market-based reforms, while the 'three represents' refers to former President Jiang Zemin's policy which formally allowed capitalists to join the party. The last idea is current President Hu Jintao's thinking of promoting more rounded economic development. Leader: President Hu Jintao is in favour of allowing capitalists to join the Communist Party, to promote more rounded economic development . Mao Zedong Thought adapted the original theories of Marxism that grew out of industrial Europe to the conditions of largely rural China when Mao took over in 1949. 'Before the fall of Bo Xilai, that direction was not so clear. But now it's become quite clear. I mean, less Maoism, but more Dengism,' Mr Zheng said. Bo, a former high-flying politician supported by leftists, was ousted this year in China's biggest political scandal in two decades. By removing Mao Zedong Thought, the top leaders were signalling a push for reforms, Mr Zheng said, in the same way Deng introduced landmark market reforms in the late 1970s that turned China from a backwater into an economic powerhouse. There was also no reference made to Mao thought in a previous announcement on the date of the party congress. Doctrinal differences between reformist and leftist factions reflect an internal debate about the direction of the new leadership whose taking up of the reins of power starts at the congress opening in Beijing on November 8. The debate has been under the spotlight since the rise and subsequent fall of Bo, who, as party boss of the southwestern city of Chongqing, drew support from leftists critical of aspects of the market-based reform agenda. China heads into the congress with the economy heading for its slowest annual growth rate in at least 13 years, while social stresses, such as anger over corruption, land grabs and unmet welfare demands, stir protests. State media, as well as experts close to the government, have made increasingly strident calls for bold reform to avoid a crisis, though nobody seriously expects a move towards full democracy. Despite his ruthless political campaigns in which tens of millions died, Mao, whose portrait looms large on Tiananmen Square, has always been largely revered as a charismatic ruler who stood up to foreigners and unified the country. Mao's legacy in China remains tightly guarded by a Communist leadership bent on preserving his memory to shore up their own legitimacy, which, unlike his, was not forged in war. In 2003, on the 110th anniversary of Mao's birth, Hu declared that 'the banner of Mao Zedong Thought will always be held high, at all times and in all circumstances'.","Mao Zedong has long been held up as an ideological great .

"The youngster, who has achondroplasia, appeared on last night's episode of the TLC reality series . By . Tamara Abraham and Kristie Lau . PUBLISHED: . 14:08 EST, 17 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 14:35 EST, 17 May 2012 . A child pageant queen with a form of dwarfism has emerged as an adorable new star of Toddlers & Tiaras. Lacey-Mae, from Brooklyn, Connecticut, has achondroplasia, which means that though she is eight years old, she is only as tall as a three or four-year-old. She is seen competing among children of her own age group though, and more than holds her own in a Bollywood-inspired dance routine. Child star: Lacey-Mae, an eight-year-old dwarf, has become the new star of TLC's Toddlers & Tiaras. She was shown dancing a Bollywood-inspired routine during a pageant featured on last night's episode . Passion: Unlike other children featured in reality show, it is Lacey-Mae's enthusiasm, rather than her mother's (right) that drives her involvement on the pageant circuit . Her mother, Kerry Ann, says performing on the pageant circuit has done wonders for her daughter's self-esteem. 'It doesn't matter if she's three feet tall or six feet tall, her personality rules the stage,' she tells the cameras. In fact, Lacey-Mae is so bursting with enthusiasm and energy, Kerry Ann even goes as far as to call her a diva. She explained how Lacey-Mae was first entered into a pageant because so many people had commented on her looks. Supportive: Kerry Ann, her mother, says that entering the youngster into pageants help to boost her confidence . Champion: Lacey-Mae got into pageants after people kept stopping her mother to tell her how cute she was . 'We decided to enter Lacey-Mae into her first pageant because people used to stop us and tell us how cute she was,' she said. 'Didn't figure that she would turn into the little pageant diva that she turned out to be.' Unlike many of the children featured in the hit TLC show, it is Lacey-Mae's enthusiasm - rather than her mother's - that drives her involvement on the pageant circuit. Kerry Ann is ready to acknowledge this, adding: 'Pageants can have a bad reputation. Some people wonder, why do you put your kids in them? This is very special for her, its for her self esteem.' Some of the more extreme grooming requirements for 'Glitz' pageant contestants leave Kerry Ann with some concerns. Before and after: With a face full of make-up and curled locks, she looks just like any other pageant star . Challenging: Due to her size, it is hard for Lacey-Mae to be fitted in traditional pageant frock sizes . Both are seen looking apprehensive as they contemplate false eyelashes. Kerry Ann tells producers: 'This is the first time we will be trying to put fake eyelashes on Lacey. I know she’s a little nervous about it’ Echoing her mother, Lacey-Mae asks: 'If it gets stuck what are we going to do?’ Luckily they make it through without any mishaps, but it's not the only challenge they face. Costumes, too can prove tricky given Lacey-Mae's size. 'It's hard because of Lacey’s size, to do a lot of adjustments,' Kerry Ann explains. 'I usually wind up cutting off probably half of the sleeve in order to fit her arm correctly. 'These dresses are very very heavy for her because her legs are so small and her torso is average-sized so I have to go in and put in some more gel pads to hopefully take off the weight of the dress for Lacey.' Pain: Typical pageant frocks are too heavy for Lacey-Mae, shown above struggling under the weight of one, so her mother is forced to adjust each of them before she performs . The episode shows how Lacey-Mae's size does attract some attention from other contestants and their parents, who don't understand that she is competing in the correct age group. One mother is seen pointing at Lacey-Mae as she asks her own eight-year-old: 'She’s in your group?' It is the judges who Lacey-Mae cares about impressing, though, and she does. After the youngster's beauty performance, Lindsay Rogers, one of the All Around The World pageant judge, says: 'I think Lacey-Mae is amazing, I think the one thing I would critique would be just to shorten the dress because it was too long.' It seems Lacey-Mae is not immune to post-show tantrums, just like any of her fellow pageant contestants. A scarf used during her Bollywood performance gets caught on her head as she attempts to twirl it around her. Upset: She feels disheartened by one of her performances which causes her to sulk once she's off stage . Post-show tears: Lacey-Mae is consoled by her mother who assures her that she did a 'fine' job on stage . She is seen crying once she has left the stage. She tells Kerry Ann: 'I'm not going to win and you know I'm not. I did horrible.' The mother assures her she did 'fine' before telling the camera that her daughter had 'felt insecure' during the performance. At the end of the day, the judges confirm that Lacey-Mae is a pageant star regardless of the slight hiccup. Crowned: Lacey-Mae is awarded a prize for scoring the best overall score for her pageant outfits . Star quality: Her mother says she looks forward to seeing what the youngster achieves next in the world of pageantry . She is awarded the Overall Best Outfit Of Choice award, which includes an unspecified amount of cash as well as a tiara, naturally. Kerry Ann says: 'We would've never thought that back when Lacey was a littlebaby that she would be where she is today. 'I can't wait to see what the futurebrings for Lacey-Mae and what she will do next.'","The youngster, who has achondroplasia, appeared on last night's episode of the TLC reality series ."
"By . James Chapman and Sean Poulter . PUBLISHED: . 18:37 EST, 18 March 2012 . Sunday trading laws are to be relaxed this summer in a move that could pave the way for longer weekend opening hours all year round. George Osborne confirmed yesterday that he is to push through emergency legislation lifting the six-hour limit on opening hours for larger stores over eight weekends in July, August and September. The move, which brought protests from Labour, church leaders and trades unions, is designed to coincide with London’s hosting of the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Cashing in: Shops will be open around the clock for eight weeks beginning on July 22 . The Chancellor, who will set out details in the Budget on Wednesday, said it would be an opportunity to try to stimulate the economy. ‘We have got the whole world coming to London and the rest of the country for the Olympics,’ he told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show. ‘It would be a great shame, particularly when some of the big Olympic events are on a Sunday, if the country had a “closed for business” sign on it.’ But Mr Osborne faced a backlash over the speed of the move – which will mean emergency laws being rushed through Parliament in the next ten days. Critics also predicted the Government would move to a permanent shift in opening hours, undermining family life for those working in retailing. The Chancellor fuelled that suspicion yesterday when he said he was proposing ‘at the moment’ only a temporary change during the Games. Under starters orders: The 2012 Olympic Games will take place between 27 July and 12 August . John Cridland, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, told Sky’s Murnaghan programme: ‘I think there is a big difference between a temporary measure to try and lock in some of the spending of the thousands and thousands of international visitors who will come to Britain during the Olympics on a Sunday and a permanent change. ‘If it is a permanent change we would need to consult a lot of people, the shops themselves and the workers in those shops, but a temporary change just for the Olympics – every little helps.’ Labour accused the Government of a ‘disgraceful’ failure to consult on the move. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said: ‘Today, on Mothering Sunday, there are mums at home with their kids because Sunday trading laws mean they can have the morning off.’ John Hannett, general secretary of shopworkers’ union Usdaw, said: ‘Our members are vehemently opposed to any further deregulation of Sunday trading hours and the Government’s own consultation on this just last year showed that there is no widespread support from either retailers or the general public for change. ‘Any change would fly totally in the face of the Government’s commitment to be family-friendly. To suggest that the  legislation, which allows shops to open for 150 hours a week, means Britain is “closed for business” is ridiculous.’ Announcement: The Chancellor will set out his Sunday trading plans in the Budget this Wednesday . Mr Hannett said he suspected the Olympics was being used as a ‘prelude to permanent change’. He said Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who has responsibility for the Olympics, had agreed to an urgent meeting on the issue tomorrow. Under the Sunday Trading Act 1994, large shops over 280 square metres in England and Wales are restricted to six hours’ continuous trading between 10am and 6pm on Sundays and cannot open at all on Easter Sunday. Some major retailers have been lobbying in Whitehall for at least five years for the restrictions to be torn up. The stores argue that 7,500 jobs would be created, generating extra money for the economy and the Government through tax. Tesco, Asda, Ikea and the DIY chains have thrown their weight behind the campaign in the past. But any change will alarm the owners of small stores, which can open all day on Sunday and benefit from the restriction on their large rivals. Tory MP Mark Menzies, who tried to change Sunday trading law via a private member’s bill, said he was ‘absolutely delighted’ that the plan was now being taken up by the Chancellor. It would ‘send out a very powerful message that Britain is open for business’. The MP for Fylde, who used to work in retailing, said about 1,700 extra part-time jobs could be created as a result at the giant new shopping centre near the Olympic park alone. But a Church of England spokesman said: ‘The Church would strongly oppose any further attempts to erode the special nature of Sunday, which legislation still reflects.’","George Osborne confirmed he is to push through emergency legislation lifting the six-hour limit .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:16 EST, 21 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:18 EST, 21 April 2012 . Hundreds of thousands of people could lose access to the internet by July following a hackers' scam - and they don't even know it. Unknown . to most of them, their problem began when international hackers ran an . online advertising scam to take control of infected computers around the . world. In a highly unusual response, the FBI . set up a safety net months ago using government computers to prevent . Internet disruptions for those infected users. But that system is to be . shut down. Connection timebomb: Most victims don't even know their computers have been infected, although the malicious software probably has slowed their web surfing and disabled their antivirus software, making their machines more vulnerable to other problems . Infected: It is estimated that a network of about 570,000 computers was targeted by hackers . Now, the FBI is encouraging users to visit a website run by its security partner . that will inform them whether they're infected and explain how to fix . the problem. After July 9, infected users won't be able to connect to . the Internet. Most victims don't even know their . computers have been infected, although the malicious software probably . has slowed their web surfing and disabled their antivirus software, . making their machines more vulnerable to other problems. Last . November, the FBI and other authorities were preparing to take down a . hacker ring that had been running an Internet ad scam on a massive . network of infected computers. Tom Grasso, an FBI supervisory special . agent, said: 'We started to realise that we might have a little bit of a . problem on our hands because ... if we just pulled the plug on their . criminal infrastructure and threw everybody in jail, the victims of this . were going to be without Internet service. 'The average user would open up Internet Explorer and get `page not found' and think the Internet is broken.' On the night of the arrests, the agency brought in Paul Vixie, chairman and founder of Internet Systems Consortium, to install two Internet servers to take the place of the truckload of impounded rogue servers that infected computers were using. Federal officials planned to keep their servers online until March, giving everyone opportunity to clean their computers. But it wasn't enough time. A federal judge in New York extended the deadline until July. Grasso added: 'The full court press is on to get people to address this problem.' Hackers infected a network of probably more than 570,000 computers worldwide. The number of victims is hard to . pinpoint, but the FBI believes that on the day of the arrests, at least . 568,000 unique Internet addresses were using the rogue servers. Five . months later, FBI estimates that the number is down to at least 360,000. The U.S. has the most, . about 85,000, federal authorities said. Other countries with more than . 20,000 each include Italy, India, England and Germany. Smaller numbers . are online in Spain, France, Canada, China and Mexico. Vixie . said most of the victims are probably individual home users, rather . than corporations that have technology staffs who routinely check the . computers. They took advantage of vulnerabilities in the Microsoft Windows operating system to install malicious software on the victim computers. This turned off antivirus updates and changed the way the computers reconcile website addresses behind the scenes on the Internet's domain name system. The DNS system is a network of servers that translates a web address - such as www.ap.org - into the numerical addresses that computers use. Victim computers were reprogrammed to use rogue DNS servers owned by the attackers. This allowed the attackers to redirect computers to fraudulent versions of any website. The hackers earned profits from advertisements that appeared on websites that victims were tricked into visiting. The scam netted the hackers at least $14 million, according to the FBI. It also made thousands of computers reliant on the rogue servers for their Internet browsing. When the FBI and others arrested six Estonians last November, the agency replaced the rogue servers with Vixie's clean ones. Installing and running the two substitute servers for eight months is costing the federal government about $87,000. FBI officials said they had taken the . unusual step of organising a system to avoid any appearance of . government intrusion into the Internet or private computers. And while . this is the first time the FBI used it, it won't be the last. Eric Strom, the FBI's Cyber Division unit chief, said: 'This is the future of what we will be doing. 'Until there is a change in legal system, both inside and outside the United States, to get up to speed with the cyber problem, we will have to go down these paths, trail-blazing if you will, on these types of investigations.' Now, he said, every time the agency gets near the end of a cyber case, 'we get to the point where we say, how are we going to do this, how are we going to clean the system' without creating a bigger mess than before.

"By . Rebecca Seales . PUBLISHED: . 04:46 EST, 1 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:01 EST, 1 June 2012 . Vanishing act: Ben Stirling was set to take the starring role of legendary American entertainer Jimmy Durante . The star of a new London musical left his fellows fuming when he popped to the loo just an hour before the play's debut - and never came back. The bizarre bolting incident occurred at the Gatehouse Theatre in Highgate, north London, where leading man Ben Stirling was due on stage for the opening night of Goodnight Mrs Calabash. The actor was set to take the starring role of legendary American entertainer Jimmy Durante, and no-one thought anything of it when he took a toilet break before curtain-up. After 15 minutes, though, the worried cast went to check on Mr Stirling - only to find he had fled into the night. Shocked . theatre bosses were forced to refund 30 tickets bought in advance of . the opening night, and turn another 30 people away from the door. Mr . Stirling, who has just done worldwide tours of Fame and Jesus Christ . Superstar, never returned to the theatre after apparently walking out . for personal reasons. John Plews, artistic director of Upstairs at the Gatehouse, said: 'We did the dress rehearsal and everybody was happy. 'At . about six o'clock some of the actors went downstairs to eat and then . the leading man got up from the table and we have never heard from him . since. 'At that time we were hoping that maybe he was just sick, but he had done a runner.' He added: 'It was like being left at the altar.' Mr Plews said it was the first time in his career that he'd seen an actor flee his own play. The incident is hardly a first in theatre-land, though: In one infamous episode 17 years ago, comedian Stephen Fry quit a West End production without notice and disappeared to France. 'At first we felt sorry for Ben because he obviously had a problem, but then we felt really angry because he had let down so many people,' said Mr Plews. The Gatehouse Theatre: Bosses at the North London venue say the show must go on . Last-minute replacement: Tim Frost (shown here) has taken the play's leading role at the last minute after Ben Stirling ran out on proceedings . To make matters worse, theatre bosses had already spent £350 on a fake nose for Stirling, who needed the prop because his character Durante had a huge hooter. 'The lead role in the musical is Jimmy Durante, a famous American entertainer in the 1940s, who was known as ""the big schnozzola"" because of his big nose,' said Mr Plews. 'Ben didn't have a very big nose so we got a prosthetic nose especially made for him at quite considerable cost. 'Because it was moulded especially to his face it sadly can't be used again.' The theatre has since been told by Stirling's partner that he has returned to his mother's home in Scotland. Luckily for theatre-goers, a new leading man, Tim Frost, who appeared last year in the Gatehouse's production of Play It Again Sam, has replaced Mr Stirling at zero notice. 'Tim has stepped into the breach and the show will go on,' said Mr Plews. Stephen Fry is perhaps the most famous example of an actor who went missing during a play's run. His walk-out took place in 1995 on the set of West End play Cell Mates, and he later revealed it was prompted by his manic depression. In 2008, Entourage star Jeremy Piven made a swift exit from David Mamet's Broadway play Speed-the-Plow, claiming he was suffering from mercury poisoning. The actor's spokesperson said doctors had advised him to step down two months early, but director Mr Mamet was sceptical, saying: . 'He told me that he discovered that he had a very high level of mercury. So my understanding is that he is leaving showbusiness to pursue a career as a thermometer.' Peter Bowles, star of 70s sitcom To the Manor Born, at least produced an interesting excuse when he walked off the stage during a 2007 performance of The Waltz of the Toreadors. Though it was later reported that he had been suffering from a viral infection, the thespian told the audience he 'was going to put the cat out'.","Ben Stirling left for 'toilet break' - but 15 minutes later he'd fled theatre .

Saskia Hamer, 37, wore the dress to an evening event to mark International Women’s Day with her boss Naz Malik from the All Wales Ethnic Minority Association. But Miss Hamer, who worked as a development officer for the charity, told how she felt 'intimidated and very uncomfortable' by Mr Malik’s personal comments. Tribunal: The boss of a race equality charity Naz Malik, left, told staff member Saskia Hamer, right, she was 'dead sexy tonight' in a dress . Miss Hamer was giving evidence in the case of a colleague claiming sexual harassment and discrimination against Mr Malik . She said: 'Mr Malik has made numerous comments to me of a personal nature. 'We were celebrating International Women’s Day. Some of my female work colleagues were intending to wear dresses. 'I was uncomfortable with that but, however, I did wear a dress. 'The evening broke up at approximately 11.30pm and myself and another colleague were carrying exhibition stands to Mr Malik’s car. 'I was then there by myself with Mr Malik. At that point he told me that he had to let me know that he thought I looked 'dead sexy tonight'. 'I found this very intimidating and very uncomfortable. 'This is just one example of how Mr Malik would come out with comments. 'When my colleague arrived back he did not make any more comments that evening.' Miss Hamer gave evidence in support of charity AWEMA’s former finance officer, Sylwia Bobrowska who claims Mr Malik, 60, sexually harassed her, discriminated against and victimised her. She claimed Mr Malik 'made a habit of being over-critical of women colleagues and belittling them in meetings'. Miss Hamer told how Mr Malik talked about the problems of having an affair in Swansea where the charity was based - and targeted his comments at Mrs Bobrowska. She said: 'He said that if she wanted to have secrets then she was living in the wrong city as he could find out within a matter of weeks the name of her grandmother. 'He then proceeded to say that if she was going to have an affair, then she was not to do it in Swansea. 'He then started giving an example of the gay politician who had moved to Wales. 'He said that within a few months everybody knew this politician was gay.' Ms Hamer said that from her body language it was clear that Ms Bobrowska was very upset by his comment. She said: 'My immediate reaction was to think that Naz Malik knew something about Sylwia and that Sylwia was having an affair in Swansea and that he wanted to make her know that he knew about it. 'The comments were not humorous nor said in a humorous manner. I was concerned for Sylwia during this time. 'Mr Malik does not behave like this towards male colleagues. He would not have said such comments to any of the male staff but he has no hesitation about making such comments to female members of staff.' Mrs Bobrowska was suspended and then dismissed after she lodged a grievance about her treatment by Mr Malik. Mr Malik denied Ms Bobrowska’s allegations and also denied telling Miss Hamer that she was 'dead sexy'. Mr Malik did not dispute making comments about the difficulty of having a secret affair in Swansea, although he denied they were specifically addressed to Ms Bobrowska.

A quarter of people who go on to be diagnosed with cancer have to go to their GP at least three times before being referred for a hospital test, a major report shows. The Government's £450million programme should have allowed women to get chest X-rays more quickly . Many are still waiting far too long, despite millions being invested in giving family doctors quicker access to crucial tests. According to the Department of Health’s own survey, nearly one in ten patients saw their GP five or more times before finally being referred to hospital. A further 16 per cent – nearly one in six – had to see their family doctor either three or four times. Cancer survival rates in Britain are far lower than those in other  European countries, largely due to late diagnosis. In . an attempt to remedy this, the Government last year invested . £450million in a four-year programme to make it easier for GPs to send . their patients for tests. This included allowing them to be . referred directly for ultrasounds, chest X-rays and brain scans instead . of having to see a consultant, who would decide if this was needed. But the results of the department’s National Cancer Patient Experience Survey for 2011-12 imply that the  initiative is having little effect. Of the 71,793 patients who took part, 25 per cent had seen their GP at least three times before being sent to hospital. This is exactly the same proportion as the previous survey from 2010, before the initiative came in. Andrew . Wilson, chief executive of the Rarer Cancers Foundation, said: ‘The . survey shows that many patients get a rapid diagnosis. People are encouraged to consult their GP as soon as they find a lump . ‘However, it is worrying there are still big variations in the number of times they have to visit a GP before getting a referral. ‘The NHS needs to do more to help GPs identify signs of cancer if potentially fatal delays are to be avoided. GPs should be making better use of tests to rule out cancer first.’ Dr Rosie Loftus, GP adviser at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ‘It is disappointing there is no improvement in the past year. ‘Spotting cancer in its early stages can make a huge difference to getting vital treatment and have a very real effect on a patient’s prognosis.’ Last year, GP magazine found that a quarter of NHS trusts are telling family doctors to send fewer patients for scans to save money. This summer, research by the National Cancer Intelligence Network found the chance of being referred was a postcode lottery. Patients in some areas were more than 60 times more likely to get sent for a scan than others. A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘GPs have a vital role in diagnosing cancer earlier and it is important they receive the right support to assess and refer patients with symptoms of suspected cancer.’","Nearly one in ten patients saw their GP five or more times before being referred to hospital .

A little-known Canadian actress is to portray Casey Anthony in a movie chronicling the controversial murder trial that led to the shock acquittal of America's most hated mother, it was revealed today. Holly Deveaux will play the 26-year-old, who has been vilified by the public after a Florida jury found her not guilty of killing her two-year-old daughter Caylee. And West Wing star Rob Lowe will play prosecuting lawyer Jeff Ashley, whose book Imperfect Justice is the basis for the movie titled Prosecuting Casey Anthony, which begins filming today. Resemblance: Casey Anthony, left, will be played by little-known Canadian actress Holly Deveaux in the movie . Striking: Miss Deveaux with her Baxter co-star Kyle Mac at the E1 Entertainment Party in Toronto . Oscar Nunez, best known for his part as Oscar Martinez on the U.S. version of The Office, will portray her defence attorney Jose Baez. It is the biggest project yet for Miss Deveaux, 19, who - despite sharing a resemblance to Anthony - has so far only starred in the Canadian TV series Baxter. She beat Kristen Stewart, Alyssa Milano and Jennifer Love Hewitt to get the part for the movie, which - due to cost - is being shot in the Canadian city of Winnipeg rather than the trial location of Orlando. However, the Toronto-born actress's role will actually be relatively limited because Lifetime producers plan to rely heavily on news footage to give the film a documentary look. Court presence: The trial's prosecuting lawyer Jeff Ashley, left, will be portrayed by West Wing star Rob Lowe . Difficult job: Anthony's defence lawyer Jose Baez, left, will be played by The Office actor Oscar Nunez . The film's writer Alison Cross told the Orlando Sentinel: 'It’s not our intention to make a movie that tries Casey Anthony for the third time. 'She was tried in court and she was tried by public opinion.' However, it emerged yesterday that Anthony will appear in court again after being found in hiding in Florida by investigators who subpoenaed her for a defamation case. She is being sued by Zenaida Gonzalez, who shares the name of a fake babysitter 'Zanny the Nanny' who Anthony initially told police had kidnapped Caylee. Anthony admitted fabricating that story. It later emerged that Anthony, whose acquittal last July has been compared to the infamous OJ Simpson case, did not know anyone by that name and the real Miss Gonzalez is not even a nanny.

Now Miss Gonzalez is suing her after claiming she lost her job and apartment due to the association with the disappearance of Caylee, whose body was found in woods near Anthony's home in 2008. After initially sticking by the claim that the kidnapper had been kidnapped, Anthony's lawyers then insisted at the start of the trial that Caylee had accidentally drowned in the family's swimming pool. 'Zanny the Nanny': Zenaida Gonzalez is suing Anthony after she falsley claimed a woman with her name had kidnapped Caylee . It is this primary Inconsistency in her story that has sparked public outrage in the case and forced the defendant into hiding after her release from Orange County Jail. Her attorneys asked that she not be forced to appear in court, saying she has received death threats since being found not guilty of murder, aggravated child abuse and aggravated manslaughter. She was convicted of four counts of lying to police and is now on probation on an unrelated cheque fraud conviction. The defamation trial is set to begin at the start of the New Year. But, as Anthony had not been seen in public, lawyers for Miss Gonzalez feared she might go missing and decided to track her down. They staked out her home for several days without Anthony appearing to be served a subpoena. Eventually, the defendant's lawyers intervened and said she would attend the court hearing. 'Our investigation team had her whereabouts pinned down,' Miss Gonzalez's attorney Matt Morgan told People magazine. 'Their backs were against the wall, so her attorneys said that they would accept service on her behalf.' Despite going into hiding, Anthony had not entirely shied away from publicity. In October she appeared in a video diary that she posted on YouTube. In it she said she was 'making changes for herself', although failed to mention Caylee. It has since been claimed that she become a newborn Christian and was been baptised again in a bid to  symbolise a new beginning.

However, this apparent new devotion to faith has not stopped her revealing a string of racy photographs of herself. Anthony has been in hiding in Florida since she was acquitted last July in one of the most controversial verdicts since the OJ Simpson case. She was released from prison after a jury found her not guilty of killing her daughter Caylee in 2008, after the toddler's remains were found in woods near Anthony's family's home.","The Office's Oscar Nunez will also play Anthony's defence lawyer Jose Baez .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 04:19 EST, 28 November 2011 . Nearly 300 trucks carrying supplies to U.S.-led troops in Afghanistan clogged the Pakistani border crossings Sunday, leaving them vulnerable to militant attack a day after Islamabad closed the frontier in retaliation for coalition airstrikes that allegedly killed 24 Pakistani troops. As Pakistan army chief General Ashfaq Pervez Kayani attended the funerals of the victims, including a major, the U.S. sought to minimize the fallout from the crisis, which plunged Washington's already troubled relationship with Islamabad to an all-time low. Pakistan also ordered the U.S. to vacate an airbase that is used by American drones to target al-Qaida and Taliban militants in the country's tribal region along the Afghan border.

Pakistan still relies on billions of . dollars in American military and civilian aid, and the U.S. needs . Islamabad's help to push Afghan insurgents to engage in peace talks. But tensions could rise further if militants unleash attacks against the stranded trucks ferrying NATO supplies to Afghanistan. The attack is the worst single incident of its kind since Pakistan uneasily allied itself with Washington in the days immediately following the September 11 attacks on U.S. targets. A spokesman for NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) said he believed aircraft that had been called in to provide air support for ground troops was responsible for the Pakistani casualties, guardian.co.uk reports. NATO has called the attack a 'tragic unintended incident.' Laid to rest: Pakistan army soldiers carry coffins of Saturday's NATO attack victims in Peshawar, Pakistan . Salute: Pakistan army soldiers march among the rows of coffins . Suspected militants destroyed around 150 trucks and injured drivers and police a year ago after Pakistan closed one of its Afghan border crossings to NATO supplies for about ten days in retaliation for a U.S. helicopter attack that accidentally killed two Pakistani soldiers. The situation could be more dire this time because Pakistan, outraged at the alleged NATO attack before dawn Saturday, has closed both its crossings. Nearly 300 trucks carrying coalition supplies are now backed up at Torkham in the northwest Khyber tribal area and Chaman in southwestern Baluchistan province. Last year, Pakistan only closed Torkham. A Pakistani military statement immediately denied those claims, saying they were attacked first and had to respond 'with all available weapons.' Pakistani officials say the troops at the outposts were sleeping at the time of the attacks. John Allen, the US commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, issued a statement saying the incident had his 'highest personal attention.'

The White House said on Saturday that senior US civilian and military officials have extended condolences to their Pakistani counterparts following the deaths, with the Obama administration pledged a full investigation into the attack. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta in a joint statement offered their 'deepest condolences' and said they 'support fully NATO's intention to investigate immediately.'

The statement said: 'In their contacts, these US diplomatic and military leaders each stressed - in addition to their sympathies and a commitment to review the circumstances of the incident - the importance of the US-Pakistani partnership, which serves the mutual interests of our people. 'All these leaders pledged to remain in close contact with their Pakistani counterparts going forward as we work through this challenging time,' the statement concluded. Full probe: The President and Hillary Rodham Clinton support 'NATO's intention to investigate immediately' The unidentified officials also said they wanted to work with Pakistan to investigate the deaths, the Associated Press reports. The airstrike dealt a huge blow to American efforts to rebuild its strained relationship with Pakistan. The White House statement did not address Pakistan's decision to block supply routes for the war in Afghanistan or its demand that the US to vacate the base. Supply trucks were stopped on their way into the country at the Takhtabeg check post in the tribal area of Khyber, Pakistan. Talks: Pakistani senior cabinet members, including Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani, left, met today in Islamabad today to discuss all arrangements with NATO and the U.S. The two countries have found tensions . rising since the killing of Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden by US . special forces in a secret raid on the Pakistani garrison town of . Abbottabad in May. Pakistan called the raid, which took place in the early hours of Saturday morning, a flagrant violation of its sovereignty while the Foreign Office equally condemned the attack. 'Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani has condemned in the strongest terms the NATO/ISAF attack on the Pakistani post,' ministry spokeswoman Tehmina Janjua said in a statement. 'On his direction, the matter is being taken (up) by the foreign ministry in the strongest terms with NATO and the US' Nato helicopter attack . The commander of NATO-led forces in Afghanistan, General John R. Allen, said he had offered his condolences to the family of any Pakistani soldiers who 'may have been killed or injured' during an 'incident' on the border. A spokesman for the force declined further comment on the nature of the 'incident' and said an investigation was proceeding. It was not yet clear, he said, whether there had been deaths or injuries. Two military officials said that up to 28 troops had been killed and 11 wounded in the attack on the Salala checkpoint, about 2.5 km (1.5 miles) from the Afghan border. The attack took place around 2 a.m. (2100 GMT) in the Baizai area of Mohmand, where Pakistani troops are fighting Taliban militants. Pakistani soldiers on patrol today close to the area near the Afghan border where a Nato helicopter killed up to 28 troops . A senior Pakistani military officer said . efforts were under way to bring the bodies of the slain soldiers to . Ghalanai, the headquarters of Mohmand tribal region. 'The latest attack by NATO forces on our post will have serious repercussions as they without any reasons attacked on our post and killed soldiers asleep,' he said, requesting anonymity because he was not authorised to talk to the media. About 40 Pakistani army troops were stationed at the outpost, military sources said. Two officers were reported among the dead. NATO supply trucks and fuel tankers bound for Afghanistan were stopped at Jamrud town in the Khyber tribal region near the city of Peshawar hours after the raid, officials said. Attack: Nato helicopters similar to this one opened fire on the checkpoint close to the border with Afghanistan killing 28 people, it was claimed . 'We have halted the supplies and some 40 tankers and trucks have been returned from the check post in Jamrud,' Mutahir Zeb, a senior government official, told Reuters. Another official said the supplies had been stopped for security reasons. 'There is possibility of attacks on NATO supplies passing through the volatile Khyber tribal region, therefore we sent them back towards Peshawar to remain safe,' he said. The border crossing at Chaman in Baluchistan was also closed, Frontier Corps officials said. Pakistan is a vital land route for 49 percent of NATO's supplies to its troops in Afghanistan, a NATO spokesman said. Reflecting the confusion of war in an ill-defined border area, an Afghan border police official, Edrees Momand, said joint Afghan-NATO troops near the outpost Saturday morning had detained several militants. 'I am not aware of the casualties on the other side of the border but those we have detained aren't Afghan Taliban,' he said, implying they were Pakistani Taliban operating in Afghanistan. The Afghanistan-Pakistan border is often poorly marked, and differs between maps by up to five miles in some places. The incident occurred a day after U.S. General John Allen met Pakistani Army Chief of Army Staff General Ashfaq Pervez Kayani to discuss border control and enhanced cooperation. A similar incident on Sept 30, 2009, which killed two Pakistani troops, led to the closure of one of NATO's supply routes through Pakistan for 10 days. Angry: Pakistan's Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani has condemned the attack . NATO apologised for that incident, which it said happened when NATO gunships mistook warning shots by the Pakistani forces for a militant attack. The attack is expected to further worsen U.S.-Pakistan relations, already at one of their lowest points in history, following a tumultuous year that saw the bin Laden raid, the jailing of a CIA contractor, and U.S. accusations that Pakistan backed a militant attack on the U.S. Embassy in Kabul. The United States has long suspected Pakistan of continuing to secretly support Taliban militant groups in a bid to secure influence in Afghanistan after most NATO troops leave in 2014. Saturday's incident will give Pakistan the argument that NATO is now attacking it directly. 'I think we should go to the United Nations Security Council against this,' said retired Brigadier Mahmood Shah, former chief of security in the tribal areas. 'So far, Pakistan is being blamed for all that is happening in Afghanistan, and Pakistan's point of view has not been shown in the international media.' He called the attack unprovoked and said Pakistan should respond by shooting down NATO aircraft and keeping the supply lines closed. 'Those who say that Pakistan cannot afford a war with the U.S. and NATO, I think we should realize that U.S. and NATO also cannot afford a war with Pakistan.' Other analysts, including Rustam Shah Mohmand, a former ambassador to Afghanistan, said Pakistan would protest and close the supply lines for some time, but that ultimately 'things will get back to normal.'","Worst single incident since US and Pakistan became allies .

The close links between Google and the upper echelons of the Conservative Party were on public display this weekend at a society wedding attended by David Cameron. The Prime Minister and his wife Samantha were guests at the marriage of Naomi Gummer, a senior Google executive. She was a political adviser to Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt – whose brief includes internet regulation – before moving to the web giant where she is now a public policy analyst. David Cameron and his wife Samantha arrive for the wedding with their 21-month-old daughter Florence who was wearing a red and white spotty dress . Miss Gummer, 27, married the Duchess of Cornwall’s godson Henry Allsopp, 38, heir to the 6th Baron Hindlip, in Chadlington, Oxfordshire. The duchess also attended the ceremony as did Mr Allsopp’s sister Kirstie, the TV presenter. Embattled Mr Hunt was there with his wife Lucia and their two young children. He has faced repeated calls to resign over his links to News International and faces a crunch session before the Leveson Inquiry this week. He wore a morning suit, like most of the male guests, while the Prime Minister opted for a less formal blue lounge suit. Mrs Cameron wore a Peter Pilotto dress. Miss Gummer is the daughter of PR guru Lord Chadlington. His country estate borders the Camerons’ in Oxfordshire, and is president of the Prime Minister’s Witney constituency party.

Mr Cameron and his wife Samantha, attended the ceremony with their 21-month-old daughter Florence, in what looks set to be a testing week for the relationship between the Prime Minister and his Culture Secretary. Both men were pictured with their families at the marriage ceremony in Chadlington, Oxfordshire. Despite the public show of unity between the men, however, it is believed the Prime Minister is preparing contingency plans for Mr Hunt leaving the cabinet. It is thought the Culture Secretary could take time out from his role in the autumn after it emerged his department is in a state of paralysis following the revelations at the Leveson Inquiry. Naomi Gummer and Henry Allsopp pictured at their wedding ceremony in Chadlington, Oxfordshire . A senior Government source, speaking to the Sunday Telegraph, said the Department was 'barely functioning': . 'The DCMS is in a state of suspended animation at the moment and this obviously has an effect on the Olympics. 'I think Jeremy could well decide to take some time out after the Games. 'He would say he has done nothing wrong and has nothing to hide, but he needs to recharge his batteries for a while.' The Prime Minister, who has also been damaged by the revelations, is likely to be tested further by Hunt's evidence at the Inquiry this Thursday. High profile: David Cameron and his wife Samantha arrive for the wedding, while right, the Duchess of Cornwall also arrives in a white dress covered in butterflies. She is Henry's godmother . It is expected that Mr Hunt's argument that he acted properly in his quasi-judicial role overseeing the News Corp bid will come under intense questioning. For now, however, Mr Hunt looked relaxed as he was pictured at the wedding with his family. A number of other high-profile guests, including the Duchess of Cornwall, who is Henry's godmother, were also at the Oxfordshire ceremony. Camilla, who was not accompanied by the Prince at Wales, wore a white summer dress with matching headwear to the wedding.

Art dealer Allsopp was previously in a relationship with the widow of Nirvana lead singer Kurt Cobain. Allsop and Gummer announced their engagement last December. The pair had grown up in the same street in Kensington, west London but only met four years ago on a Caribbean island, before starting dating each other last summer. One guest at the wedding ceremony, which took place in brilliant sunshine, described the pair as 'blissfully happy'. At the high-society wedding, nearly every male guest - including the beleaguered Culture Secretary - chose to wear the traditional morning dress, making David Cameron's decision to wear a lounge suit all the more surprising. Samantha Cameron appeared to also upstage her husband by appearing in a bright summery Peter Pilotto dress at the Oxfordshire ceremony.","Defining moment in Culture Secretary's career as he faces Leveson grilling into his handling of BSkyB bid .

He had a hand in some of the ‘most heinous and brutal crimes in human history’ during an 11-year war in Africa. And yesterday Charles Taylor, the former president of Liberia, received his punishment as he was jailed for the rest of his life by a war crimes judge. He is likely to serve his sentence in Britain following a pledge by the Labour government in 2006. Scroll down to watch the sentencing . Jailed: Liberian ex-president Charles Taylor looks downbeat as his sentence is read out today . Killer: Charles Taylor, pictured here in his heyday, was told his crimes were of the 'utmost gravity' Richard Lussick, the judge at the . UN-backed court in The Hague, said Taylor was in a ‘class of his own’ when it came to war crimes and sentenced him to 50 years. Taylor, 64, had provided arms and . support to the brutal Revolutionary United Front rebels in neighbouring . Sierra Leone – in return for a steady supply of ‘blood diamonds’. ‘While Mr Taylor never set foot in . Sierra Leone, his heavy footprint is there,’ the judge said. The rebels’ atrocities included cutting off the limbs of their victims and cutting . open pregnant women to settle bets on the sex of their unborn children, . he said. Taylor immediately lodged an appeal which means he will remain in the Netherlands for now. It will cost at least £100,000 a year . to keep him in jail here. Labour boasted that its 2006 offer of a cell . was proof of a commitment to international justice. During Taylor’s trial, model Naomi . Campbell’s evidence provided a key link between Taylor and the diamonds . he received in return for arms. First: Charles Taylor is the first former head of state convicted by a war crimes court since WWII . Warlord: As president of Liberia from 1997-2003, . Taylor was accused of war crimes including the employment of child . soldiers, rape and murder in the brutal war against neighbouring Sierra . Leone . Taylor is the first former head of . state convicted by an international war crimes court since World War II . and judges said they had no precedent when deciding his sentence. He looks likely to serve his sentence . in a British jail after Tony Blair's government in 2006 made the offer . to resolve a stand-off that had delayed Taylor's two-year trial. He said: 'The special status of Mr . Taylor as a head of state puts him in a different category of offenders . for the purpose of sentencing.' At a sentencing hearing earlier this . month, Taylor expressed 'deepest sympathy' for the suffering of victims . of atrocities in Sierra Leone. But he insisted he had acted to help . stabilise the West Africa region and claimed he never knowingly assisted . in the commission of crimes. He said: 'What I did...was done with . honour. I was convinced that unless there was peace in Sierra Leone, . Liberia would not be able to move forward.'

A child soldier of the ex-president's militia in Sierra Leone. However, judges ruled that Taylor . armed and supplied the rebels in full knowledge they would likely use . weapons to commit terrible crimes. This was in exchange for payments of 'blood diamonds' often obtained by slave labour. Prosecutors said there was no reason . for leniency, given the extreme nature of the crimes, Taylor's 'greed' and misuse of his position of power. Prosecutor Brenda Hollis wrote in a . brief: 'The purposely cruel and savage crimes committed included public . executions and amputations of civilians. 'The display of decapitated heads at . checkpoints, the killing and public disembowelment of a civilian whose . intestines were then stretched across the road to make a check point. 'Public rapes of women and girls, and people burned alive in their homes.' Soldiers backed by Charles Taylor wreaked havoc in Sierra Leone so he could obtain blood diamonds . Taylor armed child soldiers who rampaged through Sierra Leone . Taylor stepped down and fled into . exile in Nigeria after being indicted by the court in 2003. He was . finally arrested and sent to the Netherlands in 2006. While the Sierra Leone court is based . in that country's capital, Freetown, Taylor's trial is being staged in . Leidschendam, a suburb of The Hague, for fear holding it in West Africa . could destabilise the region. One of Taylor's sons is in jail for . torture, another is awaiting trial for murder and two more children were . fathered while he was in Dutch custody. More than 120,000 people were killed . and two million displaced in Sierra Leone’s civil war which was . characterised by atrocities, the use of enslaved child soldiers and the . amputation of children’s limbs as a weapon of terror. Claims: Naomi Campbell (right) allegedly accepted a 'blood diamond' from the former . African despot. She said she was given it by unknown men. Mia Farrow . (centre) contradicted this, as did Campbell's former agent Carole White (left) who said Campbell knew Taylor sent two men . to her room to give her the precious stones . Britain played a vital role in ending . the war after Tony Blair sent in 800 troops in May 2000 to evacuate . foreign nationals and support Sierra Leone’s fledgling democracy. The UK troops also assisted in . capturing rebel leader, Foday Sankoh, and helped to form a military . strategy which forced the Revolutionary United Front to retreat from the . capital, Freetown, a former Crown colony.

Captain Marc Dubois took more than a minute to return to the cockpit of Air France flight 447 after his co-pilots lost control of the plane during a severe thunderstorm. What delayed the captain has never been revealed, but two sources say that the 58-year-old veteran pilot was travelling socially with an off-duty Air France flight attendant, Veronique Gaignard. Marc Dubois, captain of the Air France jet which crashed in the Atlantic in 2009, may have been with a woman when the plane ran into trouble. Two sources say he was travelling socially with off-duty Air France flight attendant Veronique Gaignard (right) Jean-Paul Troadec, director of the . Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses, France's air accident investigation . unit, told ABC News that Ms Gaignard was not part of the investigation. The . agency was 'not interested' in the 'private life of the pilot', Mr . Troadec told the news network, which revealed Ms Gaignard's presence on . the flight. Air France 447 had been travelling . overnight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris on May 31, 2009, when it ran into . trouble, crashing into the Atlantic in the early hours of June 1. Wreckage: Brazil Navy sailors recover debris from Air France flight 447 . Disaster: The aircraft was in an aerodynamic stall, but the pilots failed to push the nose down to correct it . Black box recordings revealed that . Dubois was on a routine break as the plane entered a tropical storm, . leaving his two co-pilots - David Robert, 37, and Pierre-Cedric Bonin, . 32 - in charge. As their Airbus A330 rolled from side . to side in the storm's turbulence, Bonin and Robert - who respectively . had 2,900 and 6,500 flying hours between them - were unable to bring it . under control. They . desperately called on Dubois for help, but for reasons that have never . been completely explained, it took him more than a minute to return to . the plane's cockpit. Black box recordings revealed that Dubois was on a routine break as the plane entered a tropical storm, leaving his two co-pilots - David Robert and Pierre-Cedric Bonin (pictured with his wife Isabelle) - in charge . Bonin was in control for most of the descent, while Robert took over one minute from impact. The . emergency began with a stall warning two-and-a-half hours into the . flight, and nine minutes after Captain Dubois had left the cockpit for . his regulation rest. Although . Bonin had told flight attendants to prepare for a 'little bit of . turbulence', the report highlighted the fact that passengers were never . warned about how serious the situation had become. Inexperience? One of the plane's flight data recorders on the ocean bed. Recordings made in the cockpit have revealed the two co-pilots were too panicked to tell the captain what was happening . Instead . the Airbus climbed to 38,000 feet and then began a dramatic rolling . movement, with Bonin simply getting passengers to fasten their . seat-belts. Those on board included Bonin's 38-year-old wife, Isabelle, who was travelling without their two boys, aged 8 and 4. A detailed analysis of two black box . flight recorders from the plane has established that airspeed sensors . had malfunctioned - probably because they had frozen up. In itself, this was a problem which could have been dealt with, but the co-pilots had failed to deal with a high-altitude stall. Investigation: More than 600 pieces of . Air France Flight 447 were sent from Brazil to France by ship to be . studied further . The terrifying end of Flight 447 involved a three-and-a-half minute plunge at 120mph, in the dark, belly first, with the nose slightly elevated. 'It seems that the pilots did not understand the situation and they were not aware that they had stalled,' Mr Troadec told ABC. All those on board - who came from 32 nations, including five from Britain, three from Ireland, and two from America - died after the plane hit the sea at a speed of 180 feet a second.","Captain Marc Dubois was 'travelling socially with off-duty Air France employee Veronique Gaignard'

Tony Blair has reiterated his desire to return to frontline politics, speaking about it for the second time in a week. The former Labour premier, who left Downing Street in 2007 after 10 years in power, said he missed being prime minister and was keen to secure a top international job. He said he would have considered the posts of president of the EU or the World Bank if they had been offered to him. And he suggested that the experience . gained from his business and advisory roles since leaving power, which . are thought to have netted him about £20million last year, made him well . suited to make a comeback. Eager to return: Tony Blair said he missed being prime minister and was keen to come back to frontline politics . 'I feel I've got something to say,' he told the FT Weekend magazine. 'If people want to listen, that's great, and if they don't, that's their choice... 'I would want to emphasise how fast the world around us is changing and how incredibly dangerous it is for us to think we can stand still.' Mr Blair's comments come only two days after he admitted in another interview that he would like to be Prime Minister again. Mr Blair, now 59, has used his contacts made in Downing Street to build a multi-million-pound business empire since leaving office. Lucrative: Mr Blair, a Middle East envoy, has used contacts made in Downing Street to build a multi-million-pound business empire since leaving office . It is believed that he earns about £2.5million a year working on the bank JP Morgan's international advisory board. He has a similar role with Zurich Insurance Group, and has plans to expand his boutique financial and government advisory service significantly over the next five years. He expects the number of people he employs in his private business and his foundations to rise from 150 to 200. But the Middle East envoy denied suggestions that his growing business interests would lead to conflicts of interest. When it was put to him that Labour aides were concerned about his taking money from despotic governments such as Kazakhstan, he insisted that he used his private business to support philanthropic work, including inter-faith dialogue and pro bono work for African countries. 'Let me be absolutely clear,' he said. 'The purpose of these businesses is to generate value. 'How I then use what I take out of that is, you know (my own business)... the bit that is important to me is to build foundations of real scale.' In an interview with the Evening Standard published on Thursday, Mr Blair suggested that he would make a better Prime Minister now than he was when he was in power. He said: ‘I am seeing a lot of the world and I have learned an immense amount in the past five years. ‘One of my regrets is that what I have learned in the last five years would have been so useful to me [as Prime Minister]. Because when you see how the world is developing you get a far clearer picture of some of the issues our country is grappling with.’ Asked directly if he would do the job again, he said: ‘Yes, sure, but it’s not likely to happen is it.’ Mr Blair also said Gordon Brown had condemned Labour to defeat by ditching the New Labour policies that got him elected three times. He accused Mr Brown of having him ‘forced out’ of power, saying he would have liked to have stayed in the job but left to avoid a ‘bloody battle’ with Mr Brown’s supporters. Looking back to the day of his resignation, he said: 'I didn’t want to go but I felt that I had to. 'The only choice would have been to have fought a very bloody battle internally which I thought would damage the country as well as the party.'

The family of a five-year-old girl left scarred for life after being 'attacked by an Alsatian' have reacted with fury after the owner was told he will not be prosecuted because of 'insufficient evidence'. Abbie Varrow was forced to undergo emergency surgery after being left with severed nerves in her nose. But Darren Bartlett, 42, who was held on suspicion of having a dangerous dog, has now been given his pet back. After: Abbie has made a good recovery from the attack - but will be left permanently scarred . The schoolgirl was jumping up and down on a trampoline in the back . garden of her friend Harry Chapman’s house when she says the dog jumped at the . same time and lunged in Great Notley, Essex. Abbie will have to see a psychiatrist because she has been sleepwalking and wetting the bed after being mauled by the dog in March. The Crown Prosecution Service have told Mr Bartlett he will face no further action and he will not even have to pay for the time his Alsatian Sky spent in kennels. He denies that his dog could have been responsible for the injuries. But if his pet had been behind the mauling, the father-of-five said he would have had her put down immediately. The electrician said he should have been cleared weeks ago. Abbie had to have 60 stitches and underwent two hours of surgery at Chelmsford’s Broomfield Hospital following the attack. Her parents, Tony and Alyson, said their daughter was suffering pain every day as they hit out over the decision not to charge the suspect. Family fury: Abbie with her parents Alyson and Tony, both 50, at the spot where she was attacked by the dog in March. The animal jumped over the fence, left, and attacked her while she was on the trampoline . Mauled: Abbie Varrow, five, who was forced to undergo two hours of emergency surgery and have 60 stitches in her face . Mrs Varrow, 40, said: 'Abbie will be going . through pain every day to sort out the scar tissue on her face. Yet the . owner has got away with it and won’t even have to pay for when it was . in the kennels.' The attack on March 27 left Abbie, whose . parents have ten other children from previous relationships, in hospital for two days. Her father Tony, 40, added: 'Since this has happened, Abbie has been sleepwalking and bed-wetting. 'The . surgeon was happy to discharge her. But then after he heard about . sleep-walking and bed-wetting, he wants her to see a psychiatrist.' The family said that Abbie could have been killed by the dog. 'She could have lost her life, and in that respect you have to look at what you have got,' Tony said. No charge: Father-of-five Darren Bartlett, 42, said his Alsatian Sky, aged three, could not have attacked Abbie Varrow as he was playing with her at the time . Attack dog? Dog owner Mr Bartlett said his dog Sky, pictured, was not responsible for mauling the schoolgirl . 'She knows all the people around her are supporting her and in time we hope she can get back to normal.' Mr Bartlett said his dog could not have been to blame for the attack as she was not playing in the garden at the time of the incident. 'I was playing with her at the time so I know for a fact that she did not do it,' he said. 'If the Old Bill had done their job properly it would never have got to this point and I would have been cleared weeks ago. 'My kids have been asking me every day where Sky is while the police have had her wrongly locked away in kennels for two months – it’s disgusting.' Mr Bartlett lives at home with his 41-year-old wife Kerry Bartlett and the couple’s five children Georgia, 13, Megan, 11, Rosie, 10, Becky, 8, and Daisy, 8. The electrician continued: 'If I thought for one minute she had done it I would have had her put down myself. 'There is no way I would allow a dangerous dog in my house with five children. 'What I would ask is if my dog is so dangerous, why was it left in my house for seven-and-a-half hours with five children while cops arrested me? 'It was terrible what has happened to the little girl and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone but what I have to focus on is clearing my name and clearing my dog’s name.' A . Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said after a careful review, it was . decided there was 'insufficient evidence' for charges to be brought.

Kidnap mother Karen Matthews has got her first ever job working as a £7 per hour part-time factory cleaner, it was revealed today. The mother, 36, was jailed after faking her nine-year-old daughter's kidnap but was released after serving just half her eight year prison sentence. Matthews has been given a new identity after her release and was forced to sign on at a local job centre. The mother is living in a bail hostel . but will try and find a flat to live in with the help of a housing . association and probation officers, the People reported. She is planning on starting another . family with her new lover in the south and has found employment cleaning before staff get to work each morning. She . had seven children and lived on benefits in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, . before she was jailed for organising the kidnap of her daughter Shannon. A source told the People: 'Karen is a woman with a criminal record, no qualifications and no skills - and who has never worked. 'Her . work is in a factory but early in the morning before the workers clock . on. It is the first job she has ever had, so it will be interesting to . see if she sticks at it.' Matthews was released from Foston . Hall prison, near Derby, in April, with a new identity as she tries to rebuild her life. She now has a short hair cut and has lost a considerable amount of weight. Matthews was jailed in 2008 for the horrifying crime of kidnapping her own daughter and doping her up with temazepam and travel sickness pills. She made a plea on national television for her daughter to be returned. She was chasing £50,000 of reward money when she tried to con police into thinking a predator had kidnapped her daughter. Matthews found a new love after he began writing to her when she was . behind bars and now, according to relatives, she wants to . have his children. But the . mother could yet face fresh court action after a probe into alleged . benefit fraud was reopened. Investigators are examining more than . £100,000 she is believed to have pocketed between 2004 and 2009. Matthews was entitled to much of it - including thousands of pounds in child benefit. First job: Karen Matthews, pictured enjoying the sunshine as she goes on a shopping trip, works cleaning a factory part-time for £7 per hour .

Stacy Bowman, 25, passed away in her sleep in the mouldy property in Stoke-on-Trent while she was five months pregnant with her second child. The council had ordered the landlord Saint Pir Pandariman to carry out improvement works on the home. Tragic: Stacey Bowman, 25, died in her sleep while she was five months pregnant with her second child. her landlord is facing prosecution over his alleged failure to repair her 'damp' property . He now faces prosecution after allegedly failing to do the work and he is likely to appear before magistrates next month. Mrs Bowman shared the property with her husband Lee who she had married just a few weeks before she died in December. They had made numerous complaints to their landlord about the state of their home which they only moved into last August. Stoke City Council said the landlord was served with an enforcement requiring him to carry out repairs by November 25 last year. Stacy died on December 4 . Inspectors went back to the property just two days before Stacy passed away, only to find the landlord had not done the work. Mr Bowman believes the condition of the property may have had a significant part to play in her death. Tragic: Young mother Mrs Bowman, who leaves behind a daughter Molly, died in her sleep from inflammation to the heart and lungs . The barman said: 'She went to sleep and never woke up. The worst part was when the paramedics came and said they couldn't do anything - it was the worst moment of my life. 'The damp and mould was really bad.' A post-mortem revealed that Stacy died from inflammation to the heart and lungs. She left behind a daughter, Molly, from a previous relationship. Previous tenants in the property had complained about the state of the house and environmental health officers had launched an investigation. A Facebook tribute site was set-up following Stacy's death last December and so far over 400 people have joined the page. Tragic: Stacy Bowman who died in her property which her landlord had allegedly failed to repair . Her husband Lee Bowman wrote: 'Can't believe you have gone babe, missing you so much already. We have been married four months today and thought we had years ahead of us. 'I just want to know why you were snatched away from me and Molly. Look after yourself and baby Leyton for me. Love you both to bits and I will see you soon. 'Love you always and forever Mrs B.' Stacy's cousin Laina Gilbride said: 'Can't believe I am writing on a tribute page for you, it still doesn't seem real. 'I . thought we have had many more years together. It still hasn't sunk in . properly yet. I know you and your little man are safe up there now.' Linda Podmore said: 'Stacy you now have your heavenly wings. 'Sleep . well babe knowing your loving family will take real good care of Molly. I'm sure she will turn out the same feisty lady that you were.' Tony Oakman, director of people services at the council, said they were hoping to prosecute the landlord. He said: 'Shortly after Mr Bowman moved into his rented property in August 2011 an environmental health officer inspected it. 'This inspection revealed some repair . issues. While these issues, we believe, would not have had a significant . impact on the occupiers' health or safety, the housing standard team . served an enforcement notice on the landlord requiring them to complete . the repair works by November 25.

Plans: George Osborne is believed to be setting up a growth bond scheme to use Britain's savers to pay for Government projects . Hard-pressed Britons may be asked to bail out the Government and help finance a spending spree to pull the UK out of the economic doldrums, it was claimed today. Britain's 'cash rich' savers could soon be encouraged by the Chancellor to transfer billions of their own money into the Coalition's coffers to help force the UK out of recession. Using a ploy used during the Second World War, George Osborne wants the Treasury to offer new 'growth bonds' that will persuade people to move savings out of their bank and building society accounts. The billions this would raise would be spent on new toll roads, green energy schemes and building new houses, sources say, and help boost Britain's faltering economy. In return savers would get attractive interest rates and potentially tax-free profits. In 1940, as Britain struggled to cope with the crippling cost of . fighting Germany, savings certificates as they were known, paid for Spitfires, . tanks and warships, as well as keeping the country running. Now it appears that the Government wants to use the nation's savers . in the same way, building new tube lines, toll roads along Britain's . busiest routes and new housing with their money. 'While a lot of families are struggling and have no disposable income, there are others who are quite cash rich but have nowhere secure to put their money with a decent return,' a senior Government source told The Independent. Cash rich: The Treasury believes that although there are many hard-up families many others have savings they are desperate to invest into a scheme like this one, it was claimed . 'Because interest rates are as low as they are, there is the potential to tap into this money and get it invested in infrastructure, which will have a dramatic effect on Britain's long-term growth. 'Not only will it provide a welcome kick-start to the economy at a time when it is sluggish, but infrastructure  improvement will will also help Britain's long-term competitiveness and encourage investment from overseas. It is a win-win.' Mr Osborne's key bargaining chip is . believed to be offering savers more of the tax-free returns given to . those who have ISAs. And having their money in the Treasury would give savers added security as they would not lose their money. Old idea: In World War Two a similar scheme was used to raise money to pay for Britain's Spitfires and Lancaster Bombers as the economy struggled with the cost of war . ISAs alone hold more than £385 billion worth of cash and a lack of other decent investment opportunities may open the door for these growth bonds. Since taking power the Coalition has promised to spend big on infrastructure improvements like a new Dartford Crossing or Northern Line tube extension in London, as well as £20 billion from its balances to support small business borrowing. Nick Clegg and David Cameron have sought investment from all over the world, including from South Korean pension funds and Gulf countries like Qatar, who have enormous sovereign wealth funds. But a move to get British pension funds to bankroll some of the proposed improvements have so far not come to fruition, prompting the growth bond plan that could be up and running by the autumn. A Treasury source told the MailOnline said today the claims were 'speculative', with an official spokesman adding: 'As the Prime Minister said last month, the Government is looking at ways to use the UK’s credibility, through the use of its wider balance sheet, to support growth in the economy. Further details on this will be brought forward in due course.'","The Chancellor is said to be planning Government 'growth bonds' that offer savers attractive interest rates .

A former middle school principal who lost his job over a drug arrest went on a rampage Friday, stabbing several people - killing at least two - and then drove his car into a crowded porch, authorities said. Anthony Giancola, 45, apparently told his mother before the carnage that he was ‘going to kill all the drug dealers,’ Pinellas Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said. Then, covered in blood, Giancola again phoned his mother saying that she’d be very proud of him because he just killed 10 drug dealers, according to Sheriff Gualtieri. Scroll down for video . Checkered past: Former middle school principal Anthony Giancola, seen in a 2007 mug shot, left, for drug use, and this Friday, right, after he allegedly killed two people and injured nine more . Arrested: A police dog led officers to the former principal, who was hiding at a storage facility; he is seen after his arrest in 2007 . Authorities said there were 11 victims in all around Lealman, Florida, and that several are being treated at area hospitals for injuries ranging from minor to life-threatening. Sheriff Gualtieri said Giancola told his mother in the morning that he was 'going to kill all the drug dealers,’ and told her that she’d be proud of him for killing ’10 drug dealers,' according to WTSP. The horrific crime spree began shortly before 11 a.m. in the small city of Lealman in Pinellas County, about 20 miles west of Tampa. Authorities say that's when Giancola went to a halfway house for the hearing impaired, where officials said he stabbed four people, killing a man and a woman. Of the two wounded, one person was reported to be in serious condition. A 9-year-old girl who lived there was not home at the time, said neighbours who were stunned by the day's events. 'It's crazy,' Ken Seidl, 52, told the AP. He lives down the street from the group home. 'There's always problems in this neighbourhood, drugs, prostitution. But never nothing this drastic.' Scene of the crime: Two people were stabbed to death at this halfway house for the hearing impaired; two adults were killed here; there daughter was found a few houses down . Patching together: Officers can be seen outside of one of the crime scenes talking; in total, there were 11 victims, with many in critical condition . Pinellas County Sheriff's spokeswoman Cecelia Barreda said officers are still piecing together the timeline. 'It appears at this moment, this is all random,' said Barreda, stressing that the details of the story could change throughout the evening. However, she said, investigators believe that after the stabbings at around 11:30a.m., Giancola pulled up in front of a house in the nearby city of Pinellas Park and asked residents where he could find women. The residents told him to go away, and Giancola drove away angry. He soon returned and crashed his car into their porch, injuring three women and one man, police said. The women were taken to a nearby hospital, but the man refused treatment. Giancola also hit a 13-year-old boy on a bike as he was fleeing, officials said. The boy's injuries were minor. Shameful past: In 2007, Giancola, the then-principal of Van Buren Middle School, made a deal to buy $20 worth of crack cocaine in his office Thursday while students were still on campus . Soon after, investigators reported that Giancola went to the Kenvins Motel in Pinellas Park, where he used a microwave to attack the married couple who own the motel. Kanu and Indiranden Patel, both 57, were taken to a nearby hospital for treatment. The husband is in critical condition, officials said. By that time, officers had spoken with victims that were able to communicate and had pieced together the name of the suspect, Barreda said. A police dog tracked Giancola near a storage facility and that's where he was arrested. Giancola was first arrested in 2007. Authorities said he bought $20 of crack cocaine from an undercover police officer during the school day in his office at Van Buren Middle School in Tampa. Giancola eventually pleaded guilty to purchasing crack cocaine, possessing crack cocaine and possessing marijuana. Court records show he was sentenced to a year in jail and three years of probation. A message left at a telephone listing for Giancola seeking comment from his family wasn't immediately returned, and it wasn't clear if he had an attorney. He was charged arrested for two-counts first degree murder and two counts attempted first degree murder, according to the police report.","Former middle school principal Anthony Giancola allegedly stabbed two people at a halfway house .

A man has died after crashing into a post while strapped to a board in a new craze known as 'land surfing'. The 26-year-old  and two friends were skating with their feet secured to a surfboard on wheels when the accident happened. He suffered life-threatening head injuries after hitting a post in the car park of the D-Day Museum in Southsea, Hampshire. He had not been wearing a helmet. Scene: The 26-year-old man died after crashing into a post in this car park in Southsea, Hampshire . The man, who is believed to be from Lithuania, was taken by air ambulance to the neurological unit at Southampton General Hospital. Hampshire Constabulary informed his next of kin of the accident, which happened on Sunday evening. He was placed on life support in a critical condition with his family at his bedside and died in the early hours today. Now calls are being made for people taking part in the sport to wear proper safety equipment. David Evans, the seafront manager for Portsmouth City Council, said: 'The thing about longboards is they tend to have straps on. 'People will take risks, but they should find a place to do it safely and wear the proper equipment. 'Even in the skate park they must wear helmets and knee and elbow pads. 'It's like climbing rocks without ropes on. His parents must be devastated.' Mr Evans said land surfing was not allowed on the museum's private car park area. He added: 'Land surfing is relatively new and there are no by-laws against that particular activity. 'The carpark is not the highway - it's private land so it wouldn't be permitted. 'We would ask our community wardens to talk to people they see doing it, not least because they can get injured and bystanders can be injured. 'Any activity of this type is dangerous and users can be involved in a serious accident as has sadly happened in this case.' David Walker, leisure safety manager for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, said land surfing can be dangerous. He said: 'We would recommend that those participating in skateboarding and land surfing take the opportunity to learn from those with more experience. 'They should approach it in a similar way as they would to other adventurous activities. 'Joining a club and practising runs within their limits, while still learning the basics, are the key ways to avoid injury and improve quickly. 'Finding an appropriate location to take part and choosing the right safety kit, including a helmet and wrist guards - particularly if you are beginner - is also advised.'",Lithuanian man was not wearing helmet when he smashed into post .

Gary Lineker, Mark Lawrenson and Alan Hansen made the trip from Warsaw to Kiev yesterday. The trio, who had previously been covering the tournament from Manchester, had taken a chartered flight to Poland on Friday. Flying in style: Pundits Gary Lineker, Alan Hansen and Mark Lawrenson landed in Poland on Friday and travelled from Warsaw into Ukraine yesterday . A BBC spokesman insisted the private charter was saving licence fee-payers’ money because it meant the Corporation could cut down on accommodation costs. She also said there was a shortage of space on scheduled flights. Interest in flights to the Ukraine capital surged yesterday as fans' low expectations were turned around after England won its group stage of the tournament. Fans swamped travel websites to secure their place in the Olympic Stadium when England take on Italy on Sunday. Website CheapFlights reported an 800 per cent increase in inquiries for flights in the three hours before, during and after England's win over Ukraine on Tuesday. The cheapest flights available from London to Kiev - for just under £400 - were those going via other European cities with a stopover. On the road: England fans faced a battle for plane tickets after a reported 800 per cent increase in inquiries on Tuesday . The cheapest direct London-Kiev flight was £577, going out with Alitalia on June 23, the day before the game, and returning with KLM on June 25, the day after the game. Other direct flights available on the same dates were £590 with Luthansa and Austrian Airlines. The cheapest direct flight landing on the day of the game, June 24, was £540 with Swissair. Pricey: The cheapest direct London-Kiev flight was £577, going out with Alitalia the day before the game, and returning with KLM the day after . For those fans willing to spend up to 18 hours travelling, a £394 flight with a stopover and long wait in the airport lounge at Paris was available via flight comparison website Skyscanner. The Football Association's official licensed tour operator Thomson Sport yesterday chartered an extra plane for its £649 per person 24-hour trip for the quarter-final after the package sold out. But this package did not come with a match ticket, so fans had to find one of those on their own. It did include the cost of return flights and transfers between the airport and stadium. Skyscanner reported a massive surge in flight searches to Ukraine late on Tuesday night as Wayne Rooney fired England into the quarter-finals. Overall searches on the day of the big match against Poland were yesterday up 120 per cent compared to the day before, with flight searches doubling between 8pm and 10pm as expectation levels soared. It is flights that are the expensive part - once these have been purchased, England fans can buy tickets to the quarter-final from Uefa's official website for as little as £33. England's victory over Ukraine on Tuesday was watched by 18.5million people on ITV1, the biggest viewing figure of the year so far. The final match of the group stage of Euro 2012 eclipsed the 17million who tuned in to watch the Diamond Jubilee concert earlier this month. The BBC will now be hoping to set a new 2012 record when it airs England's quarter-final match against Italy on Sunday. Prince William could be heading to Euro 2012 if England beat Italy tonight. Palace aides confirmed they have been in touch with the Foreign Office, whose advice they must seek before the Prince travels, and the situation is ‘under review’. The semi-final is in Warsaw on Thursday. BBC pundit Alan Hansen was told to borrow a shirt from colleague Mark Lawrenson after his luggage went missing. TV anchor Gary Lineker tweeted: ‘Slight hiccup at Warsaw airport. Alan Hansen’s luggage didn’t show up. He could always borrow one of Lawro’s shirts.’ Match Of The Day presenter Gary Lineker, the face of Walkers crisps in the UK – which are called Lays in many countries – tweeted: ‘Early flight to Kiev. Just saw Polish Walkers/Lays advert at the airport. It stars Szczesny, the Arsenal goalie. Don’t get any ideas Mr Hart.’ Italy's Alessandro Diamanti takes his own hairdryer to every match, earning the nickname ‘The Hairdryer’ from teammates. It’s one better than England’s Wayne Rooney – who celebrated scoring the winning goal against Ukraine by ‘spraying’ hair gel on his £30,000 hair transplant. Hundreds of fans claim they are victims of fraud after booking online hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation in Donetsk and Kiev that did not exist. A spokesman for Booking.com acknowledged the complaints and said: ‘We have moved to resolve these matters as quickly as possible.’ England striker Jermain Defoe – now back with the team after his father’s funeral – has suffered a second family tragedy. His 16-year-old cousin Shervon Poleon died from a head wound after an alleged attack at his school in St Lucia. Defoe lost his father Jimmy, 47, to throat cancer.","Gary Lineker, Mark Lawrenson and Alan Hansen made the trip ."

Groundbreaking: Made by OraSure Technologies Inc, the $17.50 test is the only government-approved rapid HIV test that uses saliva . Would you go to a drugstore for an AIDS test? Health officials want to know, and they've set up a pilot program to find out. The $1.2 million project will offer free rapid HIV tests at pharmacies and in-store clinics in 24 cities and rural communities, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced on Tuesday. Officials are hoping testing for the . AIDS virus will become a routine service at drugstores like blood . pressure checks and flu shots. 'By . bringing HIV testing into pharmacies, we believe we can reach more . people by making testing more accessible and reduce the stigma . associated with HIV,' CDC's Dr. Kevin Fenton said in a statement. He . oversees the agency's HIV prevention programs. The tests are already available at seven places, and the CDC will soon pick 17 more locations. The HIV test is a swab inside the . mouth and takes about 20 minutes for a preliminary result. The test . maker says it's correct 99 per cent of the time. If . the test is positive, customers will be referred to a local health . department or other health-care providers for a lab blood test to . confirm the results, counseling and treatment. When . the project ends next summer, CDC officials will analyze what worked . well and what didn't, said Paul Weidle, the epidemiologist who is . heading up the project. An . estimated 1.1 million Americans are infected with HIV, but as many as 20 . per cent of them don't know they carry the virus, according to the CDC. It can take a decade or more for an infection to cause symptoms and . illness. Pilot scheme: Walgreen's pharmacy manager Sarah Freedman stands in her store in Washington, which has put up prominent signs advertising the tests . Since 2006, the CDC has recommended that all Americans ages 13 to 64 get tested at least once, not just those considered at highest risk: gay men and intravenous drug users. But fewer than half of adults younger than 65 have been tested, according to the agency's most recent statistics. It's important to know about infection not only for treating the condition but also to take steps to prevent spreading it to others. An HIV diagnosis used to be a death sentence, but medications now allow those infected to live longer and healthier lives. On special occasions, health organizations have sent workers to some drugstores to offer HIV testing. This week, Walgreens — the nation's largest chain of pharmacies — is teaming with health departments and AIDS groups to offer free tests in 20 cities. Subtle: Sarah Freedman's pharmacy has put out stacks of special test request cards so that ustomer can very quietly request the test . But the CDC program is different: It's an effort to train staff at the pharmacies to do the testing themselves, and perhaps make it a permanent service. 'I'm excited. It's such a new and novel thing for us,' said Sarah Freedman, who manages a Walgreens in Washington, D.C., that is participating in the pilot program. Would you be prepared to take a free HIV test in your local drugstore? At her pharmacy, prominent signs advertise the test but the testing is done in a private room. They've also taken steps to make sure that a customer can very quietly request the test. For example, they've put out stacks of special test request cards — they look like business cards — at George Washington University and nearby businesses. Anyone seeking a test can simply hand the card to the clerk, she said. Only three or four customers have gone through with a test in the first few weeks. 'We get a lot of questions,' she said. 'Usually they get the information and they go and sit on it and think about it.' There's a second Walgreens in Washington offering the test, as well as branches in Chicago and Lithonia, Georgia. Other test sites include East Pines Pharmacy in Riverdale, Maryland, Mike's Pharmacy in Oakland, California and a federal Indian Health Service location in Billings, Montana. Other rapid tests on the market analyze a finger-prick blood sample and are used routinely in doctor's offices . Each location will get enough tests to check 200 to 300 people.

Rapid tests are used routinely in doctor's offices, hospitals and clinics. The OraSure test can also use a blood sample but the CDC drugstore program will use a mouth swab, said company spokesman Ron Ticho. The stick-like testing device is used to wipe the inside of the mouth, then it is put in a solution. If two lines appear, that indicates a positive test. The company is seeking government approval to sell it over-the-counter for home testing. A decision is expected later this year. The test is sold in about 40 countries. Ticho said he is not aware of another country where pharmacies routinely offer the testing.","An estimated 1.1 million Americans are infected with HIV but fewer than 20 per cent know it .

A binge-drinking young man has lost the fight against liver failure at the age of 22 after he refused to give up alcohol. Gareth Anderson is thought to be one of the youngest victims of chronic alcohol abuse in the UK. He first suffered liver failure when he was 19 but was rejected for a liver transplant because he was still drinking. Gareth Anderson, pictured aged 19 in 2009, at the Ulster Hospital in Belfast. He tried and failed to give up alcohol, which ultimately killed him . Mr Anderson died in hospital surrounded by his family earlier this month after spurning several attempts to beat his addiction. The young man’s heartbroken father Brian Anderson, a former police officer, said the loss of his son has been extremely traumatic. 'We’re devastated, really and truthfully,' Mr Anderson said. 'The whole family is upset. My son was just 22-years-old and he died of liver failure. My head is wrecked at the moment, to be honest.' Brian Anderson had spoken in the past of his hope that Gareth could turn things around and get back to full health, but his son's addiction proved fatal. Gareth, from Northern Ireland - made headlines in August 2009 when, aged 19, he was refused a place on the liver transplant list because he had not been free of alcohol for six months. At one stage his desire for drink was so great he left his bed in the Ulster Hospital and walked to the nearby Moat Inn to try and get a pint of beer. His father said the act had been a 'cry for help'. Gareth, pictured in hospital in 2009, could not be considered for organ transplant because he was unable to remain alcohol-free for six months . Gareth recovered after being moved from the Ulster Hospital to the liver unit at King’s College Hospital in London, where the late Northern Ireland football star George Best underwent a controversial liver transplant. While in London, a remorseful Gareth vowed to his family: 'I’ll never touch another drink for the rest of my life. 'This is terrifying, I just want to get better and go home. 'I don’t want to end my life this early. I’m going to keep on fighting and hope for the best.' However, in January 2010 Gareth found himself back in intensive care at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, for treatment when his kidneys failed. Gareth appeared to be turning his life around and worked at this father’s pet shop in Newtownards, but within six months, he was back drinking alcohol and even attempted to take his own life. He ended up in a Young Offenders Centre, charged with beating up and threatening to kill his mother Vivienne, attacking his brother Lawrence, and for possessing drugs. He was in and out of court during 2011 on different charges, including assaulting a police officer - for which he was imprisoned for three months. After getting out of jail he was back binge drinking and died two weeks ago surrounded by family.

Gavin Plant and Lindsay Carrington have brought forward their wedding to that their son Riley can take part . The parents of an 18-month-old who has an untreatable brain tumour have brought their wedding forward four months so their little boy can be a page boy before he dies. Riley Plant has been battling a grade-four tumour since he was diagnosed in April, but last week doctors told his parents Gavin Plant and Lindsay Carrington that his condition is terminal. The couple, from Burnholme, North Yorkshire, say the news has 'crushed and devastated them', and want to make the time Riley has left special - starting with him being page boy at their wedding. They are also raising funds to take him on a dream holiday to Disneyland Paris. Father Gavin, 24, a private with the Royal Signals, said: 'We're trying to cram as much into the weeks he has left so that he's happy, and so we have some good memories - because memories are all we'll have after he's gone.' He and fiancee Lindsay, 25, first noticed that Riley was unwell at Christmas, when he starting being sick, but they put it down to his feeding.  In the next few months, they noticed he was wobbling around a lot, and being sick. They took him to their GP who told them Riley had a virus. Two weeks before Easter Riley stopped walking because he was so weak. They took him to nearby York Hospital, where again they were reassured it was just a virus. Unconvinced, after Easter they returned to the hospital, where a CT Scan revealed a tumour on Riley's brain. On April 17, surgeons at Leeds General Infirmary operated on little Riley - but unfortunately they could not remove a small part of the tumour. Riley was started on chemotherapy three weeks later, and doctors tested his spine and brain fluid which was found to be clear of cancer. Grandma Simone, 42, said: 'Little Riley was very poorly during the chemo. Every side-effect you could think of, he got. He lost his spark, it was really hard to watch. 'It was a very tough time for the whole family, watching Riley being so poorly.' Riley, left, before he became unwell, and right, during treatment . Despite the family's hopes that Riley would pull through, at the beginning of July doctors found a shadow on the back of his neck during an MRI scan. Although they could not confirm it was a tumour, they told the family that it was a cluster of cells which could develop into a tumour.  They also tested his brain and spinal fluid again - and devastatingly found that it was riddled with cancer. Simone, who runs a beauty salon, said: 'Unfortunately last Thursday the doctors told us that there was nothing more they could do, and they were going to stop the treatment. 'They've told us to make the most of being with him, to do what he can do before he gets too ill.' The family are planning to take Riley on two caravan holidays, to Cadbury World, as well as a dream holiday to Disneyland Paris with the help of Yorkshire Children's charity Make a Dream. Surgeons at Leeds General Infirmary could not remove all of Riley's brain tumour . Family and friends have been generous in their donations, raising £5,000 so far, but the family are still intent on raising more to make sure their little 'Smiley Riley' can live life to the full. Doctors have not been able to put a time on his life, Simone explained, adding: 'They said it could be weeks or months. But they said Riley had done well to live this long with his tumour. 'They said if it was an adult, they wouldn't have lived this long, but because Riley's skull is soft the tumour has been able to grow so much.' Lindsay, who already has two girls, Ebony, eight, and five-year-old Kelsy, has managed to get her wedding dress made in time and the photographer, cars and venue - the Pavilion Hotel in Fulford - were rearranged when they decided to bring the wedding forward. Gavin said: 'We are just devastated - it's like our whole world has been crushed. 'It feels like we are in a bubble, we're just trying to get on with things as best we can and keep ourselves busy. 'Riley's nothing like he was before he was diagnosed and he never will be again, but since he finished his chemotherapy he has been much happier - smiling and dancing - he loves to dance. 'But his condition will only get worse. Every day we see him getting a little bit weaker and it's heartbreaking. 'We just want him to be at the wedding - it wouldn't be special if he wasn't there.'

Staring back at the camera with a look of resignation, bogus bride Helena Puchalska is frogmarched out of a register office in handcuffs. Polish Puchalska, 20, arrived for the sham ceremony with Asif Ali, a 31-year-old Pakistani graduate whom she barely knew, in a tight white dress wrapped in a fur coat. The happiest day of their lives: Polish 'bride' Helena Puchalska and her Pakistani husband-to-be Asif Ali are marched away from their wedding ceremony in handcuffs . Jailed: Puchalska (left) was sentenced to 15 months in prison, while Ali (right) was given two years . But the couple found officers from the UK Border Agency ready to arrest them after being tipped off by a suspicious registrar. Officers discovered Ali had arrived in . Britain four years earlier to study on a legitimate visa at a London . university. But the visa had expired. Northampton Crown Court heard how he . offered money, believed to be £2,500, to EU citizen Puchalska if she . married him, which would have allowed him to remain in the UK. Puchalska, a warehouse worker, was . jailed for 15 months while Ali, described as the driving force behind . the deception, was jailed for two years after they admitted conspiring . to breach immigration laws with their sham wedding. Sentencing the pair, Judge Richard Bray said the bogus ceremony struck at the 'sanctity of marriage'. He said: 'You were caught undergoing a sham marriage for the purposes of immigration. 'This . is a serious offence, not only because it breaches our immigration laws . but because of the aggravating feature that it strikes at the sanctity . of marriage. Sham: Officers from the UK Border Agency arrested the couple at Northampton Guildhall just as they were about to go through with the ceremony . 'Such offences . are still prevalent today as anyone who reads the newspapers knows. Sentences of some length are needed for such blatant and cynical . offending. 'You, Ali, were . the instigator and had most to gain. You are intelligent and knew . perfectly well what you were doing. You, Puchalska, went along with this . enterprise for money.' They claimed to have met in a . nightclub last March. Ali said they toasted their engagement with vodka – . in honour of Puchalska's Polish heritage. In December the couple met the . registrar at Northampton Guildhall  – where they would be arrested the . next week – to plan the ceremony. The official became suspicious  when . Ali could not spell his bride-to-be's name and did not know her home . town. The only thing he could tell the . official about his bride's homeland was that it was cold, had forests . and that soup and ham dominated the national diet. Joe Spicer, prosecuting, said: 'There was a ceremony planning meeting on December 19 at which the registrar became concerned this wedding did not appear to be genuine. 'She noticed Ali was answering all the questions and the bride appeared to be entirely disinterested in what was to take place. There was also no intimacy or contact between them.' After the hearing, a UK Border Agency spokesman said: 'As they pleaded guilty, the notes were not subject to handwriting analysis so we cannot say they were definitively written by Ali but it's true to say they were found in the boot of his car.' Inspector Andy Radcliffe, of the UK Border Agency's Criminal and Financial Investigations team, added: 'This was a marriage of convenience - convenient for Puchalska because it would have lined her pockets and convenient for Ali because it was a means to UK residency.'","'Bride' and 'groom' were arrested as they made their vows during ceremony .

Skilled at sports: Alexis Busch's father was an . executive vice president of the San Francisco baseball team and, as a . teen (right), she was the first ever female bat girl in the league . Disaster: The 28-foot boat is seen here, surrounded by seals, after crashing into the Farallon Islands in the San Francisco Bay following freak waves during a race on Saturday . The expert sailors were participating in the Full Crew Farallones Race, which has been held since 1907 without incident, circles out from San Francisco Bay out to the barren islands before returning back to port. This crew were aboard a 38-foot Low Speed Chase when they were struck by unexpected 12-foot waves and pushed off board. The owner of the boat, James Bradford, was one of the three survivors and he reportedly turned the boat immediately around to go after the crew who had been pushed overboard. When he did that, the Low Speed Chase was then hit by a second massive wave that crashed it into the rocks off the Farallon Islands. The other two survivors were Nick Vos, who was the longterm boyfriend of the female victim, and Bryan Chong. A search began for the four missing but now it is feared they may never be found after the U.S Coastguard called off the search indefinitely, saying that the viable search time had passed. Lieutenant Chris Hanzlik of the  U.S. Coastguard said: ‘The operation continued for 30 hours covering an area . of 5,000 square miles.’ Irish sailors: Alan Cahill (left) and Elmer . Morrissey (right) both moved from Ireland to America and were two of the . five fatalities in Saturday's boat race . Found . dead: Marc Kasanin, 46, was the only victim whose body was found by . rescuers. When he wasn’t busy sailing or painting nautical scenes, he . would help his mother who lived within walking distance . Coastguard and California Air National Guard helicopters lifted off after receiving an emergency alert from a satellite beacon on the Low Speed Chase, as well as a mayday radio call from a nearby yacht. The female victim, Alexis Busch, was born in San Francisco and was an a part of the close-knit sailing community. On her Facebook profile, she had pictures of she and her boyfriend, Mr  Vos, at a 2010 race in Sydney, Australia. The couple had been dating for 10 years since meeting in high school. Ms Busch was the daughter of former San Francisco Giants executive vice president Corey Busch and she became involved in the game as Major League Baseball’s first bat girl, carrying bats around for the team. ‘I’ve never experienced anything like this, and I don't ever wish anyone to experience what we're going through,’ Mr Busch told The San Francisco Chronicle. Rescue: Coast Guard and National Guard helicopters and water craft rescued three crew members who were clinging to rocks . Saved: The rescued crew members had life vests on and cold weather gear - equipment that gave rescuers hope in the search for the missing . ‘I can't even describe what the heartache is. You're not supposed to lose a child, and Alex was an incredible person. She was a very special person. It's hard to imagine life without her.’ In a statement, Giants President and CEO Larry Baer said: ‘We were deeply saddened to learn that a member of the Giants Family - Alexis Busch - was one of the victims of this horrible tragedy. The devastated mother of victim Alan Cahill, originally from Ireland, Nóirín, said her son had moved to the U.S. a decade ago. Speaking . from her home in Cork, Ireland, she said: ‘We are totally heartbroken. Alan loved the U.S. and he loved his sailing. But he kept in touch with . his family and friends, and loved to come back to Cork whenever he . could. He has friends all over Ireland, especially in the sailing . community. ‘Alan married an American girl called Shannon. They have two beautiful children in California.’ Phil . Oakley, who played college hockey with Elmer Morrissey, another . victim who was also from Ireland, said the sports enthusiast was ‘the . life and soul of parties’ and a ‘very funny’ writer of sports blogs. ‘You wouldn’t forget him,’ he added. Stranded: The boat was washed onto the barren islands and it remains there now . Unexpected: Trouble came when they were struck by two 12-foot waves . He said his friend, who wore the No.13 jersey, had been ‘so unlucky’ with hockey injuries. Mr . Oakley added: ‘One of our friends is getting married in Italy in August . and he was due to be one of the best men. It was going to be a big . reunion of all the people in college.’ Mr . Morrissey graduated from University College Cork with a PhD in energy . engineering in 2004. He then studied in California thanks to a . scholarship and returned to live there last year. He had worked in the research and development field in Ireland. Fr John Paul Hegarty of Glounthaune parish said Mr Morrissey’s parents, Michael and Ena, are dealing with a terrible grief. Memorial: The team paid a special tribute to the victims at their game on Monday, making particular mention of Ms Busch . Local: Ms Busch (bottom left), seen here with Mr Vos (top right) and two friends, was born in San Francisco . Long term: Ms Busch (left) and Mr Vos (right) met in high school 10 years ago . He . said: ‘Elmer’s family are abroad and are due home today. He has a . sister, Kelda. We said special prayers at Mass for Elmer and Alan. ‘He . and Alan would have been accomplished sailors. They were very good . friends. They were very fine sportsmen who liked the outdoors and were . very athletic. The final missing victim, Jordan Fromm, had grown up sailing and his parents were longtime members of the club that manages the annual race. ‘He was just a sweet guy. A lot of times young sailors who are really good can be cocky- but not him. He’d take the time to explain things to you,’ said Kerry Spiller who raced with the Low Speed Chase several times. Mr Kasanin, whose body was the only one recovered by rescuers, was raised similarly and went on his first sail at age 5. Tragedy: Women walk together to a vigil at the San Francisco Yacht Club in Belvedere, California for the missing sailors during a race . Upset: The close-knit sailing community in San Francisco is devastated upon hearing the news of a dead sailor, four missing and three rescued . The San Francisco Chronicle reports that when he wasn’t busy sailing or painting nautical scenes, he would help his mother who lived within walking distance with the gardening. ‘I just relied on him for everything, and he was a good friend,’ his mother Anne Kasanin told the paper. The three survivors escaped with fairly minor injuries, the worst being a broken leg. Ed Lynch, director of the yacht club, said the accident was ‘a tragedy of unbelievable proportions’. He said that Mr Cahill was a ‘close personal friend and neighbour’ who was ‘a very experienced sailor who had done a lot of open ocean racing’. He added: ‘Alan was a terrific guy, who had the Irish wit. Around the yacht club he was named Irish Alan.’ The club, founded in 1869, held a private candlelit vigil on Sunday. This tragedy was the first fatal accident in its history. The Full Crew Farallones Race is a century-old tradition that has never been for the faint of heart. Winds averaging 10 to 20 knots . (18-37kilometres) and churning 14-foot Pacific Ocean swells are among . the rough conditions typically braved by yachts and their crews during . the day-long regatta, a favourite of skilled sailors. The search: Coast guards stopped looking 30 hours after the accident . The 87kilometre race, organised by the 143-year-old San Francisco Yacht Club, had 49 entrants. But as the Low Speed Chase cruiser . with two Irish crewmen aboard rounded the South Farallon Island, two . strong waves swept them from the boat. The steep and rocky Farallon Islands . are visible from San Francisco on a clear day and uninhabited except for . a manned research station. Part of a national wildlife refuge and . closed to the public, they are home to vast quantities of birds and are . surrounded by waters rich with seals and sea lions, and sharks that . feed on them. Low Speed Chase remains grounded but intact. R David Britt, a chemist who skippered . his sailboat, Split Water, in the race for the third time said the . sailing on Saturday was ‘pretty intense’. He added: ‘The worst thing is to have a . wave break on you. You can go up and down, up and down, but if a wave . breaks on the cockpit on top of the crew, that’s how somebody could get . swept out of the boat.’ WATCH THE VIDEO HERE .","Five of the eight people on board a .

A 'person of interest' in the murder of marine's wife Brittany Kilgore left a series of bizarre postings on a depraved BDSM sex website, it emerged today. Louis Perez, 47, who is also a Marine, used to live in Fallbrook, California, with his girlfriend and made posts on the website BMEHookups.com about wanting to find another 'sex slave' to join his home. Jessica Lynn Lopez, who has been charged with murder in Mrs Killgore's death, currently lives with Perez's girlfriend. The families of both Mrs Killgore, 22, and Lopez, 25, both vehemently deny that the two were linked with Perez's sex ring. Alternative lifestyle: Louis Perez, a persona of interest in the murder of Brittany Killgore, posted several photographs like these on a kinky sex website . Master and slave: Perez's girlfriend, seen here with her face blurred, said she had 'two slave girls' However, in a posting on another BDSM website, TSRnetwork.com, Perez's girlfriend wrote: 'We have a poly home in which I own two slave girls. Life is good,' the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. Poly refers to 'polyamorous,' an alternative 'open' relationship style with multiple sexual partners. Authorities have not said what led Lopez to allegedly kill Mrs Killgore and Perez has not been formally implicated in her death. Perez is currently in jail after he was arrested for possessing an assault rifle stolen from nearby Camp Pendleton, where he had served for 10 years. He is not cooperating with police, the Union-Tribune reports. On BME Hookups, a website devoted to matching connecting people with kinky sex fetishes, Perez, who used the online alias 'Ivan' wrote: 'I am lord and master, dom and daddy of my house. My slave, Ms. Dee, is a slave to no one, but myself.' His 36-year-old girlfriend described herself as 'an alpha slave to master Ivan.' Perez posted several photos of himself and his girlfriend on the website and said he was looking for another woman to join his home. Internet outlet: Perez's girlfriend posted several messages on the website TSRnetwork.com . Mrs Killgore was married to Cory Killgore, a Marine who was recently deployed overseas to Afghanistan. Mrs Killgore, it was revealed, maintained a blog years ago where she wrote about fears about marriage and divorce. In the blog titled 13smyfavoritenumber, Killgore, whose nude body was discovered on Tuesday, wrote about her insecurities and how she suffered from depression, according to NBC San Diego. ‘im so insecure sometimes its not even funny (sic),’ she wrote aged 17, adding that she had recently stopped taking anti-depressants. Tragic: The body of Brittany Killgore was discovered on Tuesday, four days after she was last seen with a marine who was later arrested on an unrelated charge . Suspect: Authorities believe that the victim knew Jessica Lynn Lopez (pictured here), and the two were involved in some kind of sex slave ring . She also told how she was worried . about getting married because of the high divorce rates. Tragically, . Killgore had filed for divorce from her Marine husband Cory Killgore the . week before she went missing. When responding to a question about . whether she wanted to get married, Killgore wrote in 2007: ‘i want to . be, but … i want to love that person. the divorce rate is so high its . sad.’ In other postings, Killgore revealed . she did not get on with her family and was looking forward to moving out . and going to college. ‘im planning to move out its very . difficult. i dont get along with my family all that well i think it will . be better when i move out. my sister and i have gotten closer though, . its actully realy weird,’ she said . The blog comes to light as the woman accused of killing the young wife pleaded not guilty to murder charges on Thursday. Prosecutors offered no details of the . motive Jessica Lynn Lopez, 25, had to allegedly harm Killgore, whose . body was discovered in brush near a lake in San Diego, California. Suicide attempt: Jessica Lynn Lopez was found with numerous self-inflicted stab wounds on her body at this Ramada Inn near the San Diego Airport . Estranged: Brittany Killgore, right, filed for divorce from husband Cory, left, last week . However, Lopez's neighbor claims she and Mrs Killgore were involved in a dangerous sex ring, playing sex slaves. A . second Marine, Louis Ray Perez, who has been named a person of . interest, has not been charged with the murder. He is currently in jail, . facing charges he stole an assault rifle. Lopez was discovered with the note in a San Diego hotel room, . prosecutor Patrick Espinoza said. No further details were released about . the note. Authorities said earlier this week . that paramedics hospitalized Lopez after finding her with self-inflicted . cuts in the room but didn't disclose the suicide note. Within hours of . finding Lopez, searchers discovered the body of Killgore. Bail for Lopez was set at $3 million at her arraignment in Vista Superior Court, north of San Diego. Lopez's . attorney Dean Broyles said he didn't know if his client knew Perez or . Mrs Killgore, who was reported missing Saturday -- one day after Lopez . turned 25. 'There's a lot of speculation, a lot of innuendo, a lot of weak allegations and charges out there,' he said. Missing: Brittany Killgore lived in Fallbrook, California, not far from Camp Pendleton . 'I would caution everyone to not jump to conclusions and prejudge based on all the information flying around right now.' Mr . Broyles said Lopez would ask the judge for a public defender after her . family sought his help in fielding media questions. Lopez's parents, who . live in nearby Escondido, released a statement saying they loved their . daughter. 'We pray for the . family of Brittany Killgore and ask that the Lord comfort them during . their time of grief and anguish,' the parents said. 'We ask that you pray for all of those impacted by this tragic situation, including our family.' Authorities have not disclosed Mrs Killgore, Lopez, and Perez are connected. A neighbour, who declined to be identified, told ABC 10 that both Lopez and the victim took part in some kind of sex ring, saying: 'They're into the sex slave things... I try not to judge, but that's what they're into.' Perez, 45, pleaded not guilty . on Wednesday to stealing a AR-15 rifle from Camp Pendleton. Investigators have given few . details about that case, and it was not known if they suspect the weapon . was tied to Killgore's death. Perez was being held on $500,000 . bond. His attorney Jeffrey Reichert said his client has no criminal . history, is married and has lived in San Diego County for 10 years. Mrs Killgore went missing shortly after . filing for divorce from her husband, Cory Killgore a 22-year-old Marine deployed to . Afghanistan. Fears: Cory, right, is returning from Afghanistan after hearing about the disappearance of his wife, left . Her body was found in brush near Lake Skinner in Riverside . County about 25 miles northeast of her modest, two-story apartment in . Fallbrook, a San Diego County community known for its avocado orchards. Killgore lived a short walk from an . entrance to Camp Pendleton, and her complex - like others around it - is . full of Marines and their families who tend to be short-term residents . and often don't get to know each other well. Killgore's husband, Lance Corporal . Cory Killgore, flew back to California after learning his wife was . missing. Sheriff's authorities say he is not a suspect.

A bankrupt company boss is attempting to make legal history by claiming he is unable to pay maintenance to his ex-wife because he has no money. If Alexander McRoberts gets his £350,000 claim written off, it could open the flood gates to similar legal challenges the High Court heard. Mr McRoberts , 54 of Datchet, Berkshire, is asking the court to rule his matrimonial debt did not ‘survive’ his declaration of bankruptcy in 2006. Legal history: If Alexander McRoberts (right) gets his claim that he is unable to pay maintenance to his ex-wife Mandy McRoberts (left) because he is bankrupt, it could open the flood gates to similar legal challenges . He was once the head of a multi-million pound company who separated from his wife Mandy McRoberts in 2003. Under their divorce agreement, she was given their marital house and Mr McRoberts agreed to pay her more than £500,000 in instalments. Mrs McRoberts, who lives in a £500,000 house in Newton Court, Old Windsor, had received £211,000 of that money before her ex-husband fell on hard times and declared himself bankrupt. Mrs McRoberts, who is a director of a chauffeur-driven car hire company, now wants the remaining £349,000 he still owes her from the divorce settlement but this is ‘impossible’ for Mr McRoberts now, the court heard. His bankruptcy was discharged in September 2007 and Mr McRoberts later re-established himself as CEO of an international baggage handling firm, although his barrister, Simon Calhaem, said ‘the curtain has come down’ on that venture. His ex-wife was registered as a creditor in his bankruptcy and Mr Calhaem said that Mr McRoberts feared he will be again bankrupted if his debt to Mrs McRoberts is not expunged. Acknowledging that the case raises a ‘novel point’ of potentially huge significance, Mr Calhaem told the judge: ‘Mr McRoberts' financial position is such as to make any chance of a payment of £349,000 impossible now, or in the foreseeable future. ‘Mrs McRoberts' financial circumstances, as is clear, are far more comfortable than her ex-husband's.’ ‘Neither Mr or Mrs McRoberts have had any real contact with each other or any knowledge of each other’s dealings since 2003.’ Although . Mrs McRoberts ‘challenges the veracity of her ex-husband's financial . status,’ Mr Calhaem insisted that ‘a full scale change in his financial . circumstances’ had taken place. 'Further reflection': Justice Robert Hildyard said at the High Court (pictured) that the case 'raised some curiosity as to the relationship between the bankruptcy jurisdiction and the family jurisdiction' Byron James, representing Mrs McRoberts, warned the judge that a ruling in Mr McRoberts’ favour could create a legal loophole for exploitation by unscrupulous spouses. It would be ‘opening the door to all the bankrupts out there who don't want to pay their lumps sums in family proceedings,’ Mr James said. Mr Justice Hildyard said: ‘I don't want to do anything that suggests that so long as you go into bankruptcy that is the gateway to avoiding the family court's orders. There are lots and lots of husbands and wives who are company directors. ‘The default position is that, although the bankrupt gets a new start in life, he still has round his neck orders made in family proceedings for lump sums and costs.’ ‘If the on-going order was made as a crystal ball assessment of the parties' needs, it may well be that the bankruptcy court can take those changing needs into account.’ Mr Justice Hildyard said the case ‘raised some curiosity as to the relationship between the bankruptcy jurisdiction and the family jurisdiction’ and that ‘there is a point which possibly needs some further reflection’. The decision on the case was reserved until a later date. Neither Mr McRoberts nor Mrs McRoberts made any comment outside court.","Alexander McRoberts hopes to have his £350,000 claim of maintenance payments written off because he says it did not 'survive' his bankruptcy .

A four-year-old girl whose mother and sister were shot dead in front of her revealed the identity of the suspected gunman to detectives, it has emerged. When armed police officers arrived at the murder scene in Lawrenceville, Georgia - at which two other people had also been killed - they heard shuffling noises from the upstairs of the house. They pointed their guns in the direction of the noise and demanded that the person reveal themselves. Horrific: Nhaje Butler witnessed the fatal shootings of her mother Atania Butler, left, and her sister Jhane Thomas, right. She identified the suspected gunman to police officers . At that point, young Nhaje Butler came out into the open from behind a stair rail and held up her hands in surrender. Gwinnett County Police Sergent Kevin Eisenhouer said she then calmly told officers 'he's gone' and said 'Rich killed my whole family'. The revelations of the girl's extraordinary bravery were revealed during witness statements at the trial of Nhaje's mother's boyfriend, Richard Ringold, 47. He could get the death penalty if found guilty of the four murders in August 27, 2009. Prosecutors say Ringold shot Atania Butler, 28, after the pair had had an argument. The court was told that, the day before the shooting, she had discovered Ringold was cheating on her with another woman. They allege that after the pair had had an argument, he shot his girlfriend and then raced through the house shooting at her daughters, Nhaje and 11-year-old Jhane. In the dock: The revelations of the girl's extraordinary bravery were revealed during witness statements at the trial of Nhaje's mother's boyfriend, Richard Ringold, 47, pictured . He is also alleged to have shot Miss Butler's 19-year-old roommate Rico Zimmerman and LaKeisha Parker, 30, who was a blind and mentally challenged woman who Mr Zimmerman was caring for. The only survivor of the shootings was Nhaje. Speaking yesterday at the start of the second week of witness statements at the trial, Sergeant Eisenhouer said he picked up the youngster into his arms and asked if she was ok after she emerged in front of police officers at the murder scene. But she replied: 'No, he shot me, too.' Sgt Eisenhouer told the jury that when carrying Nhaje outside of the house, he had to cover her eyes as he stepped over the body of her mother which was sprawled across the entrance to the front door. Tragic: The murders of the four people took place at his house in Lawrenceville . After Nhaje was passed onto paramedics, she asked that they did not cut off her shirt because it had been given to her by her mother and it was one of her favourites. After lifting the shirt over Nhaje's head, paramedics discovered she had been shot through the chest and left shoulder. The brave youngster had also placed Band-aids on her chest and arm in an attempt to dress her own wounds before the emergency services arrived. Now 7, Nhaje is expected to take the witness stand today. Ringold has pleaded not guilty. The trial continues.

Scandinavia may be known for its grey, downbeat television thrillers, but something has recently brought a smile to their faces: A contender for the world's most 'ridiculously photogenic' policeman. Henrik Ruonala posted a photo of himself with a lost puppy on Facebook in a bid to find the animal's owner - and overnight became the most desirable man in Sweden. Officer Ruonala, who is based at a station in Skärholmen, a suburb south of Stockholm, put the picture of himself and the Yorkshire Terrier on the station's Facebook page alongside the message: 'Is there someone missing this little fellow, we found him Wednesday night and he is now at our police station.' Ladies' man: Police officer Henrik Ruonala has become the most wanted single man in Sweden after posting a photo of himself with a missing puppy on Facebook last week . Little did he know that the post would go viral and he would be inundated with messages from admiring ladies. The picture has now been liked by some 25,000 women and over 1,700 comments have been posted commenting on the young officer's Viking good looks. Its incredible popularity has brought comparisons between Officer Ruonala and the 'Ridiculously Photogenic Guy' meme that went viral in April, making a worldwide star of handsome Zeddie Little. Under the photo of Officer Ruonala, one lustful lady wrote: 'Too bad the guy in the picture is not missing, I could really think of taking care of him.' Another said: 'It is war now ladies, the man in uniform is mine.' Mr Ruonala is shocked by the attention. While he has not been on a date with any of the women, he has received . lots of offers - some more graphic than others - in recent days. 'I'd love two for the price of one. Mmmmmm.' 'I want make him dinner, have him in my kitchen right now.' 'I want to go on a date with the guy in the picture, we can get a dog later.' 'l'lI take the policeman, somebody else can take the dog.' 'It is war now ladies, the man in uniform is mine' 'He can sleep on my stomach. The dog can sleep on the sofa.' 'Never mind the dog, I want to take that little fellow in uniform with me home.' The officer said: 'I have my own dog, he is a four-year-old Rottweiler named Rex. I guess I have some explaining to do when I . come home and meet him now.' The photo has also been shared by more than 2,000 people and some comments have been written by excited women as far afield as Germany and Italy. At the small . police station where he works, Mr Ruonala's colleagues are now having some fun at his expense. Chief Constable Mikael Sundberg said: 'As his superior, I would like to . tell everyone that Henry is single and I would also like to add that his . superior is also single and even better-looking.' The puppy, called Chico, has now been reunited with his owners. They wrote on Facebook: 'We are very happy to have . our beloved Chico at home again and that he is well. 'We hope that Henrik . now will find the woman of his dreams and live happily ever after. Our . little dog has really given him a chance, so now it is up to him.' Admirers: Mr Ruonala's army of female fans stretches way beyond Sweden . The 'Ridiculously Photogenic...' trend began when photographer Will King took a picture of Zeddie Little running the 10km Cooper Bridge run in his hometown of Charleston, South Carolina. The photograph was posted on Flickr and Mr Little became an internet sensation - even appearing on television show Good Morning America as Ridiculously Photogenic Guy. He was followed by Ridiculously Photogenic Surgery Girl - also known as Rachel - who became a similar internet sensation after posting a photograph of herself in hospital as she recovered from lung surgery. The internet's eye was then - bizarrely - drawn to the Syrian civil war, where a handsome soldier carrying a grenade launcher liberated people's hearts with his smouldering looks to become Ridiculously Photogenic Syrian Rebel. It was only a matter of time before a sports star became the focus of the craze, and New England Patriots wide receiver Brandon Lloyd's smile for the camera as he scored a touchdown three weeks ago was the textbook 'Ridiculously...' photo opportunity. The moment will be recorded in sports history for nothing more than the six points, but to those in the know it will be forever remembered as the birth of Ridiculously Photogenic Football Player.","Henrik Ruonala found the adorable Yorkshire Terrier a week ago .

Chaos: George Osborne's plan to reform child benefit is causing problems at the HMRC because they are struggling to explain the changes to those involved . George Osborne’s scheme to cut child benefit risks descending into chaos because the taxman is struggling to explain the complicated reforms to parents. HM Revenue & Customs is planning to send letters to better-off taxpayers in the next few weeks to tell affected families what to do. The controversial changes will see households where one parent earns more than £50,000 no longer receiving full child benefit. Families where a parent earns more than £60,000 will lose the money entirely. But the fiendish complexity of the reforms means that the HMRC cannot come up with a form of words that taxpayers can understand. Letters have been scheduled to be sent since the start of the autumn. Accountants warn of chaos because the taxman has left it far too late to implement the scheme in time for the planned January 7 launch. Last night HMRC said the first letters would start to be sent out from next week. A spokesman said they will ‘set out the options clearly so that an informed choice can be made in time for the 7 January rule change’. The reforms will require half a million people to fill in complicated self-assessment returns for the first time. From next year, households where one parent earns more than £50,000 will no longer receive the total amount of child benefit, which is worth £1,055 a year for one-child families. Setting out the options: The HMRC said that it would start sending out letters next week well ahead of the 7th January deadline . Those on more than £60,000 will not receive any at all, with the amount of benefit decreasing on a sliding scale as a person’s salary rises between £50,000 and £60,000. Some 1.2million families are affected. The new rules have been criticised for penalising stay-at-home mothers because they take into account only the highest salary in the household. Two working parents each earning just under the limit could earn £100,000 together and retain the full child benefit, while a household with just one income of £60,000 would lose all theirs. ‘The letter isn’t yet ready but it should be ready to go by the end of this week,’ said the HMRC spokesman. ‘We always said it would go out in the autumn and we want to get all the details right.’ The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales warned the Coalition yesterday that HMRC had left it too late to implement the scheme in time. Family friendly? David Cameron with daughter Florence . Anita Monteith, a manager at the institute’s tax faculty, said the ‘ill-judged’ policy would overburden a tax system already ‘creaking at the seams’. ‘I don’t think it is the right time to bung in a whole bunch of people who have never had to engage with self-assessment before and be lumbering them with a tax charge that is not intuitive,’ she said. She added that most people did not know the changes were coming, warning: ‘Jan 7 is not far away.’ Elaine Clark of Cheapaccounting said: ‘There is barely a matter of weeks to go before a radical overhaul, yet those affected know next to nothing about what is happening. It’s a ridiculously complicated system that, in an era supposed to usher in “tax simplification”, looks set to be almost unable to be implemented.’ Mike Warburton of accountants Grant Thornton said: ‘There’s so much work involved and very little time left to get it sorted. ‘For example, it’s going to be very difficult to work out what actually constitutes a family for the purposes of making these tax calculations. ‘How does the taxman work out what constitutes a partner, and how will it track it? It could take at least two years for the policy to settle down.’ Cathy Jamieson, Labour’s Treasury spokesman, said: ‘For hundreds of thousands of parents on middle incomes, who face losing every penny of their child benefit in just a few weeks’ time, this is no laughing matter. ‘David Cameron and George Osborne’s policy is unfair with some couples earning as much as £100,000 keeping all their child benefit but one-earner families on just £50,000 seeing theirs cut. ‘And the chaotic way this ill thought through policy is being implemented looks set to be yet another example of this government’s incompetence.’ A Treasury spokesman said: ‘It is unfair to continue paying child benefit to those on high incomes and we are making the system fairer by introducing the changes.’ ANALYSIS By SAM DUNN . Within days around 1.2million letters need to be sent to households that will be stripped of child benefit. Yet officials have still not drafted the all-important wording of the document or even set up a telephone help-line. The delay is creating enormous uncertainty for families – almost half of which will now need to fill out a self-assessment tax form. And concerns are growing that thousands of stay-at-home mothers, whose state pension credits depend on child benefit, will be caught out. When the Chancellor announced the changes, his Treasury aides insisted such parents would not lose out. But there is still no detail as to how this will be made to happen. There are also complex ‘claw back’ calculations to grapple with from January 7. Where one partner earns £50,000, the household must pay back 1 per cent of child benefit for every £100 earnt above this – up to the £60,000 ceiling. To make matters worse, the sums are based on the higher earner’s salary – not household income. So, in another first, tax policy may force parents and partners to find out exactly what the other earns. HM Revenue & Customs appears not to have anticipated fully the impact of half a million families using self-assessment forms for the first time. Asking them to apply a tricky formula to an already complicated form is a disaster in the making. In particular, the definition of what actually constitutes a ‘partner’ – temporary or otherwise – will be contentious. It is even possible that a man who moves in with a woman who has three children could see himself landed with a £2,450 tax bill. The way in which families where one earner makes more than £60,000 can opt out of claiming child benefit is also unclear. The payments are currently worth £20.30 a week for the first child, and £13.40 for further offspring.Taxpayers have suffered greatly at the hands of bungling HMRC in recent years with shock tax demands, shoddy customer service and incorrect tax codes. All that families want is certainty. But with just weeks to go before child benefit is stripped away, HMRC looks to be heading for another disaster.","Complexity means HMRC cannot agree on form of words taxypayer will understand .

Doctors said there was a procedure used successfully in adults which involves transplanting faeces into a patient's body to clear up serious symptoms caused by the bacteria C.diff. Scroll down to hear a doctor discuss C.diff risk . 'I was all for it': Tatum Williams (left) helped to save the life of her young son Jesse (right) by using her faeces in a transplant operation to cure his killer gut infection . 'I was all for it,' said the Baltimore mother-of-two. 'We had been dealing with his C.diff for nine months. He was losing weight because of everything he would lose in his diaper.' Jesse, who was born extremely premature, has suffered various health problems which have been exacerbated by the C.diff infection. He had already been given strong antibiotics and injections to boost his immune system, but they were not effective. According to federal health officials, C.diff causes some 14,000 deaths every year and make another 300,000 seriously ill.

Public sector workers enjoy pensions that are worth 50 per cent more than the retirement payouts given to many private sector workers, a report said yesterday. The authoritative finding challenges union claims that the pensions of state workers have been destroyed by the Government’s reforms. The report, from the Pensions Policy Institute, a non-political research body, said there were ‘still significant differences between pensions in the public and private sectors’. Better off: Despite numerous protests against public sector pension cuts, a new report has found that they still offer a better deal than most private sector pensions . Niki Cleal, a director of the . institute, said: ‘Even after the Government’s proposed reforms, the . average value of the pension benefit would remain more valuable than the . pensions which are most commonly available to employees in the private . sector.’ The average public sector worker also . earns a higher salary, works shorter hours and takes more sick days than . the average private sector employee. Under the reforms, which are being . introduced at the moment, state workers must work longer and contribute . more to their pensions. 'Extremely generous' deal: Taxpayers Alliance chief executive Matthew Sinclair supports the proposed pension reforms . They have lost the link to their final . salary and their pensions will be based on career average salaries, but . their pensions remain gold-plated. The institute said that typically, . their pensions are worth 15 per cent of their salary. Before the . reforms, they were worth 23 per cent. By comparison, a typical private sector worker’s defined contribution pension is worth only 10 per cent of salary. The institute said that if state . workers were to be stripped of their pension rights they would need to . get a 15 per cent average increase in their salary to make up for the . loss. Most private sector workers do not . have a company pension scheme, with the number of members at its lowest . level since records began in 1953. Only 2.9million of the 23.9million . private sector workforce are in a company scheme. For private sector workers who have a . gold-plated final salary scheme, it is highly lucrative, typically worth . 23 per cent of their salary, but the numbers have collapsed. Tom . McPhail, head of pensions research at the financial advisers Hargreaves . Lansdown, said state workers have suffered ‘some swingeing cuts’ to . their benefits in recent years. But he added: ‘They will still do very well relative to the typical private sector worker.’ Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of . the Taxpayers’ Alliance campaign group, said: ‘The vociferous opposition . to any reform of public sector pensions looks even more out of touch . with reality given this independent assessment. ‘Even after necessary and moderate . reform, public sector pensions will remain extremely generous, yet the . unions still fight tooth and nail even the smallest of changes. Well off: Nearly 9000 retired NHS workers are on pensions worth between £50,000 and £100,000 a year (posed by models) ‘It is absolutely right that those . enjoying these premium deals should pay a fairer share of the cost of . their retirement, especially as we are all living longer.’ The Government’s pensions tsar, Lord . Hutton, the ex-Labour minister who was the architect of the reforms, . said state workers’ pensions before the reforms were ‘not sustainable . and fundamentally unfair’. For example, 8,700 retired NHS staff in England and Wales enjoy a pension worth between £50,000 and £100,000 a year. The institute’s report looked at the . four big public sector schemes, which cover NHS workers, teachers, local . government staff and civil servants.","New report finds public sector worker pensions are worth 50 per cent more than private sector pensions .

Revelation: Teacher's aide Paula Pace has been suspended after a caller phoned her school to reveal she had killed a girl as a teenager . A teacher's aide in Iowa has been suspended after an anonymous caller revealed to the school she was part of an Indianapolis family who tortured and killed a 16-year-old girl in 1965. Paula Pace, now 64, has worked in Conrad, Iowa since 1998 and was a teacher's aide at the district's high school. Yet the caller revealed Pace was in fact Paula Baniszewski, who was jailed for killing Sylvia Likens with her mother, siblings and children in the neighborhood after months of beatings and humiliation. 'They wanted to make us aware of it because of the crime that was . involved and because she was in the school system,' Grundy County Sheriff Rick Penning said of the caller.

Pace and Paula Baniszewski have the same birth date, and said she has no criminal charges pending. Busted: The caller revealed she was actually Paula Baniszewski, right, who tortured and killed a girl in 1965 . The discovery comes nearly five decades after Syvlia Likens and her sister Jenny moved into the Baniszewskis Indiana home for a summer while their parents worked at carnivals. The Likens, whose three other children stayed with relatives, were put in touch with mother-of-seven Gertrude Baniszewski by a mutual friend and agreed to pay her $20 a week for the childcare.

Sylvia's malnourished body was found dead in the cellar on October 26, 1965 and it was determined she from brain swelling and internal hemorrhaging of the brain. In May 1966, Gertrude was found guilty of first degree murder while Paula was found guilty of second degree murder, and they were both sentenced to life in prison.

A quarter of those suffering from bowel cancer are diagnosed only once they are admitted to hospital as an emergency, say researchers. Many of these patients are less likely to have potentially life-saving surgery because they are diagnosed too late and the cancer is too advanced, according to surgeons. Women, the elderly and less well-off were most at risk of losing out on early diagnosis and care. Too late? One in four cases of bowel cancer are diagnosed in A&E . A national audit found that around . 8,000 bowel cancer patients in England each year get attention only . after an emergency admission to hospital. Records on 31,000 patients admitted in a 12-month period were analysed by the National Bowel Cancer Audit and linked for the first time with hospital data. The new data is in keeping with research by the National Cancer Intelligence Network about bowel and other forms of cancer released last month. It found one in three cancer sufferers over 70 is diagnosed only after they turn up in A&E departments, sometimes with severe symptoms caused by the cancer, such as pain, breathing difficulties or fitting. More must be done: Professor Norman Williams said patients who present at A&E with the disease are more likely to be suffering with end stage cancer . Professor Norman Williams, president of the Royal College of Surgeons, which co-authored the latest data, said: ‘It is extremely concerning that so many patients are being diagnosed with bowel cancer at such a late stage. ‘Patients who present with this disease as an emergency  are more likely to be suffering with advanced stage cancer  and, as a result, are less likely to be suitable for potentially life- saving surgery. ‘More must be done to improve early detection and to raise awareness around the symptoms of bowel cancer. ‘The NHS Bowel Cancer Screening programme has now been rolled out across the country and it is so important that patients take up the invitation to be screened as this will vastly improve rates of early diagnosis and treatment outcomes.’ The data, covering the period between August 2009 and July 2010, found 28 per cent of women patients – 3,820 of a total of 13,570 – were diagnosed after an emergency hospital admission.For men, this figure was 22 per cent – 3,870 of 17,240 patients. Older people, aged 85 and over, accounted for 47 per cent – 1,690 of 3,580 patients.Altogether, 30 per cent of the most deprived patients were first diagnosed after emergency admission (1,470 out of 4,940) compared with 22 per cent of  the least deprived (1,410 of  the 6,550).","Women, the elderly and less well-off most at risk of losing out on early diagnosis .

Just two months ago, Olympic athlete Alistair Brownlee was receiving a rapturous applause after he won a gold medal in the triathlon in front of a home crowd. But the super fit athlete proved he is human after all after he was rushed to hospital in Leeds with stomach cramps. There doctors diagnosed him with appendicitis - an inflammation of the appendix and said they would need to remove it quickly. Thankfully, the operation passed off without a hitch and Brownlee even posted a graphic surgical picture of his infected body part shortly afterwards. He asked his 59,000 followers: 'Anyone know what this is? I might put it on ebay!' The 24-year-old, from Branhope in Leeds, had been on his way to Heathrow to catch a flight to Brazil when he was taken ill. Luckily . his father Keith, who is a consultant paediatrician, was on hand and . sent him straight to A&E at the Leeds General Infirmary. He tweeted: 'Yes it was my appendix. Got horribly ill last week, went into hospital with a sore tummy and . came out 2 days later. Thanks Dad and the NHS!' He added: 'Was on my way to airport en route to Brazil, trip put back a week and first trip to a Hospital instead.' An appendicectomy takes around 30minutes to perform and performed under general anaesthetic. The appendix is now often removed via keyhole surgery as it means a shorter stay in hospital and a quicker recovery. The surgeon makes two or three small cuts of about 1cm each in the lower abdomen and passes special instruments through to remove the organ. The cut is then closed with stitches or glue. Anyone know what this is? Alistair Brownlee tweeted a picture of his operation to his 59,000 strong-stomached followers . Dr Brownlee told the Yorkshire . Evening Post: 'The whole family was absolutely delighted at the care and . treatment Alistair received from the doctors, nurses and other staff at . Leeds General Infirmary.' Dr Brownlee did not perform the appendectomy. Alistair won his gold medal in front of cheering crowds in London's Hyde Park, providing one of the most memorable images of the games. His brother Jonny took a bronze in the same event. Alistair is now having to rest-up following his operation and yesterday flew to South America for a three-week holiday starting in Brazil and going on to Peru. He will be forced to watch his brother compete in the Auckland Triathlon on the TV. He wrote on Twitter: 'Would . have been great to help Jonny out in Auckland but I've been forced into . and am ready for a rest.

A gunman jumped into a car and opened fire immediately killing two of five victims inside before pushing out the driver’s body and taking off with his three surviving passengers still inside. Police in Camden, New Jersey say the masked man armed also with a machete jumped into the parked vehicle late Saturday night sparking a shockingly gruesome attack even for a city consistently ranked as the nation's most dangerous. The gunman is said to be still at large while investigators believe he may have known at least one of his victims. Scroll down for video . Slain: The vehicle's driver 20-year-old Jewel Manire was one of the two victims killed during Saturday night's horrific attack . Tragic death: Khalil Gibson, 20, of Camden was sitting in the passenger seat when he was shot and killed by the gunman . While parked in an alley on Hull road around 11.45pm, the group’s vehicle was approached by the masked man who entered on the driver's side soon before delivering a spray of bullets inside, said Camden County prosecutor's spokesman Jason Laughlin. He fired several shots, killing the 18-year-old driver, Jewel Manire, and Khalil Gibson, 20, of Camden. A 20-year-old woman was wounded in the face during his gun fire, a 16-year-old was shot in the head and another 16-year-old in the arm, Laughlin said. After the gunman stopped shooting, he pushed aside Ms Manire's body and drove off with all the victims inside except the teenager who was shot in the arm and managed to escape and called 911. Identity: Police are working to find a motive for the gunman, who has not been identified, attacked the vehicle and its passengers while they suspect he knew at least one of his victims, Ms Manire and Mr Gibson pictured . The car was driven to a nearby dirt road, where the 20-year-old woman also jumped out and ran off. The gunman briefly pursued her but could not catch her, and he soon ran away. He was described as Hispanic and about 6 feet tall. He wore a black mask over the lower part of his face and yellow latex gloves. All three wounded victims remained in the hospital on Sunday with two in critical condition. Camden, a city of about 80,000 that sits along the Delaware River across from Philadelphia, continually ranks as one of the most dangerous and poorest in the U.S. The two fatalities bring the city's homicide total this year to 50, eight short of the record reached in 1995. Fleeing the scene: Police are seen late last night where the vehicle was abandoned by the gunman before he took off remaining at large by Sunday . City officials are trying to replace the police department with a force run by the county, a move that would circumvent union rules in order to increase the number of officers while keeping costs the same. Last month, authorities said they were trying to determine whether a contaminated batch of PCP was going around town after a child was decapitated and two other children's throats were slashed by people believed to be on the illegal drug. A man charged in the attack admitted to police that he had smoked 'wet,' a combination of PCP and marijuana.

The Colorado schoolgirl's dismembered body was found on October 11, six days after she vanished on her way to school. After initial speculation about a . possible connection to an attempted abduction in the same area of . Westminster where Jessica’s body was found, police confirmed the . connection on Monday October 22. A clue? A tuft of blonde hair was found about a mile from where 10-year-old Jessica Ridgeway's body was discovered prompting local station Fox 31 to link the evidence to the case . In the abduction attempt, an . unidentified young woman was jogging around a lake in May about a . half-mile from the Ridgeway home was grabbed from behind by a man. The . attacker tried to cover her mouth with a chemical-soaked rag but she was . able to escape. According to The Denver Post, the woman described her attacker as a . light-skinned Caucasian male between 18 and 30 years of age, 5 feet 6 to . 5 feet 8 inches tall with a medium build and brown hair. 'Police believe there may be a . connection between the Jessica Ridgeway murder and the attempted . abduction at Ketner Lake, and urge the public to specifically look for . someone with a cross like this that matches the suspect's description . from Ketner Lake,' Mr Materasso said. This new line of investigation comes . the same day that police found a tuft of blonde hair just a mile away . from where 10-year-old Jessica Ridgeway's body was discovered. From missing to murdered: The Colorado . schoolgirl's gruesomely dismembered body was discovered in a park 10 . miles from her home on October 11, six days after she vanished on her . way to school . Someone walking in a field made the . discovery at the weekend and comes just days after police found a wooden . cross which they believe may be a vital piece of evidence in the case. A local news channel reported that the . source alerted police to the scene and a grid search was conducted . while the hair was taken into evidence. But Westminster police investigating her murder are dismissing claims that the hair is a definite clue in the case. He told the Denver Post that so far there is nothing to suggest the hair has anything to do with Jessica or is even human. 'We don't even know if this is dog . hair yet,' he said. 'Like everything else, every tip we've gotten, it . was taken and we'll take a look at it to see if it's connected.' Another recent clue in the tragic . investigation that police are examining carefully, appeared in the form . of a wooden cross last week. Pictures of the cross, which is 1.5 . inches tall by 1 inch wide with a hole at the top so it can be worn as a . necklace, were released by Westminster Police Department on Friday. Hope gone: After the grisly discovery of Jessica's body on October 11, the search for Jessica turned into a hunt for her killer . 'Authorities are looking for someone . who may carry or wear this type of cross, may have recently purchased . one of these, or is known to have some association with one,' Westminster Police Department Mr Materasso said in a statement. Police are also looking for local businesses that may sell these types of crosses. The solid wood pendant has three . vertical markings etched into the horizontal bar of the cross and a . zig-zag pattern carved into the opposite side. 'The cross appears to be a solid piece . of wood and the upper post portion is offset from the lower post below . the short horizontal section,' Mr Materasso said. He added that the item 'could become a pivotal piece of evidence that helps authorities identify and locate Jessica's killer.' Recent clue: Pictures of the cross, which is 1.5 . inch tall by 1 inch wide with a hole at the top so it can be worn as a . necklace, were released by Westminster Police Department today . Jessica was last seen beginning a . short walk from her home to Witt Elementary School on the morning of . October 5. She never arrived. A search by hundreds of law officers . did not start until hours later because Jessica's mother works nights . and slept through a call from school officials saying Jessica wasn't . there. Then, on October 7, Jessica's backpack was found on a sidewalk in Superior, some 6 miles northwest of her Westminster home. At about 5pm on Wednesday October 10, . dozens of officers flooded into Pattridge Park in Arvada, combing the . foot of a hill, walking no more than five feet apart, reportedly working . on a credible tip. Life cut short: Jessica's body was so dismembered that police had trouble identifying the body . Heartbroken: Jessica's dad, Jeremiah Bryant, pictured, breaks down during a press conference, as Jessica's mother describes their little girl . Family in mourning: Jessica's father, Jeremiah Bryant (left) and mother, Sarah Ridgeway, (second right) were initially investigated by police but have since been cleared of any involvement . The focus of their search was an . abandoned cabin that appeared to have been part of a former mining . operation. The area is now a popular park where neighbors often come to . hike, ride bicycles and fly model airplanes. Police said they are not suspicious . that Jessica's parents, who are divorced and fighting a custody battle . over her, had any involvement in the disappearance. The U.S. Marshals Service, immigration . officials and state Department of Corrections were reviewing registered . sex offenders in the area, Yacone said without elaborating. Investigators have received more than . 1,500 tips from the public. Authorities also have searched more than 500 . homes and more than 1,000 vehicles but still need the public's help, .

Troubles continue for Vernon Winfrey, the 79-year-old father of talk show host Oprah, as he reported to a Tennessee court that he has overdrawn at his bank. Mr Winfrey is in the midst of a contentious divorce from his third wife Barbara , who claims that he both cheated on her and made threats to kill her. Now Mr Winfrey is returning with accusations that Barbara, who is asking for spousal support, makes far more than the $282.33 he makes per month. Divorce battle: Barbara Winfrey, right, made accusations against Vernon Winfrey, left, in divorce papers saying he threatened to kill her and cheated on her numerous times . Barbara told The Tennessean that in addition to the salary he earns from his barbershop, Vernon also receives $25,000 ‘every three months from a trust funded by his daughter’. Money: Oprah's stepmother says that the TV personality set up a fund that pays her father $25,000 every three months . Barbara hopes to have Vernon pay for their mutual bills and expenses for the duration of the trial, which given the many areas of disagreement, may go on for some time. She also claims that her husband conspired with his billionaire daughter to have her thrown out of their home in East Nashville, Tennessee even though she has nowhere to go. Another aspect of the case is the supposed violent threats that Vernon made to Barbara over the course of their 12-year marriage, including one occasion where her husband 'became angered at her, chased her with a gun and threatened to shoot her. She also claims he had 'more than one adulterous relationship'.. The accusations were made in a counterclaim after Vernon Winfrey filed for divorce from his third wife on June 22, just five days after their 12th anniversary. He claimed that his 64-year-old wife was 'guilty of inappropriate marital conduct' and cited irreconcilable differences. She denies the claims. The couple lived together in the gated Laurel Brooke subdivision in Williamson County’s Grassland community, according to the Tennessean, in a property worth almost $1.5million. But because the home is titled in Oprah's name, both she and her father have been trying to force Barbara - who is seeking alimony support - out of the marital home even though she has nowhere to go, according to the court papers. The store in Nashville, Tennessee, was bought by Oprah last week for $475,000. Barbara Winfrey said the purchase means the chat show host, who now runs her own TV network, has gained control of the business and cut her out. ‘I know what is going on. I'm tired of it, and I've had enough,’ Barbara Winfrey told WSMV TV in Nashville. Family feud: Oprah Winfrey bought her father Vernon's property when it went into foreclosure at the beginning of July, paying $425,000 . On the same day Oprah bought the property, Williamson County Sheriff’s officials responded to a call from Barbara who said Vernon and an 'entourage of his friends' had shown up at her home. Barbara told the local media that Oprah was controlling her father. ‘He believes what he's told. His daughter doesn't care about the community. His daughter doesn't care about the barbershop. But I do,’ she said. WSMV said they had confirmed that Oprah, who is worth an estimated $2.7billion, paid $475,000 for the barber shop. In a statement to the TV station a spokesman for Oprah said: ‘Oprah purchased the property that was in foreclosure. ‘Vernon Winfrey has been a fixture in the community for decades and will continue to manage the business on a day-to-day basis.’ Dispute: Vernon Winfrey filed for divorce from his wife of 12 years saying she was guilty of 'inappropriate marital conduct' which she has denied . In a telephone call to the TV station Vernon said: ‘My wife and I, we have not been getting along well, and I did not want to endow myself to another drawn-out, struggling debt.’ Vernon, a former town council official, has run a barbershop in East Nashville for 50 years. He moved from the old premises in 2011 and the new salon had a boxing theme. At the opening of the new barber shop Vernon said the premises would be his legacy to the community. ‘When I'm gone, I'm glad I'll be able to say I left the neighborhood looking nice,’ Winfrey said. He said his daughter had urged him to give up cutting hair, but he planned to continue. ‘Some folks say, “Winfrey, you're kind of old to be doing it.” I say, “You're right, but I feel good,”’ he said.","Barbara Winfrey claim's Oprah's father Vernon 'cheated on her multiple times and threatened to shoot her'

Lloyds last night dashed hopes that it will curb excessive bonuses,saying that it would not be reforming its pay structure in the ‘foreseeable future’. Expectations were raised after it  emerged that the state backed lender has mooted plans to ban annual bonus payments for top staff in the wake of the investor backlash against boardroom greed. Its remuneration committee has been discussing a series of proposals to change the way it dishes out windfalls. Lloyds is mulling over proposals to change the way it dishes out windfalls to staff . Options include ditching annual bonus payments and extending the timeframe for share payouts – called long-term incentive plans – from three to ten years. This would tie the awards of directors to the long-term performance of the company and help clampdown on reckless behaviour. But last night it appeared to distance itslef from the proposals. ‘We keep our remuneration plans under review at all times but have no current plans to change our structures and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future.’ Deborah Hargreaves, director of the High Pay Centre, said: ‘It’s a shame that the first radical thinking to come out of the banks for five years has been rebuffed. We urgently need one of the banks to have the courage set an example.’ While rivals, including Barclays and Citigroup, faced a pay rebellion in the so-called shareholder spring, Lloyds escaped a bruising at this year’s annual showdown with investors in May. But the issue of pay is particularly toxic at a state-backed bank. Lloyds and RBS are already banned from paying cash bonuses of more than £2,000. Loyds boss Antonio Horta-Osorio also defused pressure by waiving his £2.4m bonus for last year. But his pay package - worth up to £6.9m a year – has come under intense criticism. News of the proposed reforms emerged as the incoming financial watchdog warned it would dish out early fines to clamp down on wrongdoing. Antonio Horta-Osorio, group chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group waived his £2.4bn bonus last year under media pressure, but is still paid £6.9m a year . The Prudential Regulation Authority said enforcement action would no soon longer be used merely as a last resort and that it would consider taking enforcement action at ‘an early stage’. The PRA will be one of two watchdogs taking over from the Financial Services Authority next April. It will supervise banks to ensure they are being run safely while the Financial Conduct Authority will seek to protect consumers against mis-selling.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 12:59 EST, 22 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:31 EST, 22 October 2012 . A former security contractor, fired from his role as a medic in Afghanistan after being filmed so stoned he couldn't speak, has spoken out about the shocking culture of alcohol and drug abuse he claims was rife in his military camp. 41-year-old Kevin Carlson was exposed by a pair of whistle-blowing former colleagues who felt so outraged by what they saw taking place they secretly recorded it and passed it on to news outlets. Employed by Jorge Scientific, a major U.S. defense contractor, Carlson was working as a team medic in Kabul, a role that gave him free range and access to prescription drugs. He was stationed at the contractor's base of operations, which he described as a 'frat house', turning into a 'nightmare' environment where he felt so trapped he turned to drugs. Scroll down for video . Admission: Medical officer Kevin Carlson admitted that he frequently injected himself with narcotics just to 'get away' because the place was such a 'nightmare' 'I don't like airing my own dirty laundry, don't like showing my own faults,' Carlson told Abc News. 'But the story needs to be told… It was getting to be such a nightmare, just living in that place. Carlson's intoxicated state was among the disturbing scenes captured by whilstleblowers John Melson . and Kenny Smith, but he insisted that the drugs and alcohol were rife among other employees, including soldiers who would join them for 'dinner and parties'. 'They consumed some of the alcohol,' he said. 'It's not like they didn't have an idea of what we were doing.' In the interview Carlson told how he used Percocet and Diazepam tablets, at times injecting himself with Ketamine to give his mind 'a mental break'. 'I didn't want to use alcohol because that impaired you for so long and you have the effects the next day,' he said, 'so I chose Ketamine. 'I would take the Ketamine every once in a while just to give my mind a break and escape from the reality that was actually going on.' Other contractors and staffers would help themselves to Carlson's medical stores, he said, putting the safety of the camp at serious risk. 'There's no way if we ever came under attack that they'd be able to do anything to protect or repel an invasion or an attack.' Shocking video: The security manager for the company can be seen half-naked and chugging a glass of vodka at the covert location in Afghanistan . Drunk: Melson said there is no way any of the employees involved would have been able to respond to any terror attack because they were so 'out of it' It was a bitter cycle that Carlson said he felt trapped by, until he was eventually found out and fired. 'The longer I stayed there they kept drinking more. Doing more things that were not normal. Some just childish, dangerous things.' He added that he hopes he might be able to rekindle his once-promising career. The shocking video allegedly showing U.S. Security contractors drunk, stoned and engaging in outlandish behavior while they were in Afghanistan protecting American lives was leaked last week. The footage is believed to have been recorded earlier this year at a Jorge Scientific operations center in Kabul. It appears to show key personnel drunk or high on drugs, chugging drinks, semi-naked wrestling and injecting drugs. The alleged behavior went undetected by U.S. military officials and put American lives at risk. The whistle blowers revealed that if a terrorist attack had been made at this time, then employees would have been too 'out of it' to respond. Outlandish behavior: As two of the men wrestle, bottle of alcohol - which is supposed to be forbidden - can be seen lined up in the background . Lawsuit: The footage is believed to have been recorded earlier this year at a Jorge Scientific operations center in Kabul and appears to show key personnel drunk or high on drugs, chugging drinks, semi-naked wrestling and injecting drugs . Melson Smith, gave the video to ABC and say it documents a number of allegations they have made in a . lawsuit against Jorge Scientific. The U.S. Army has now launched a criminal investigation into the Virginia-based company, who has won almost $1 billion in U.S. government contracts. They said they were unaware of both the video and the allegations until last month. Whistle blowers Melson and Smith worked as armed . security officers for three and five months respectively, in Kabul as . part of a $47 million contract Jorge Scientific had under the U.S. Legacy Program to train the Afghan National Police in counter-insurgency . efforts. They said they quit out of sheer disgust for the behavior, because of the way they were treated by their colleagues, who would bully them for not joining in the party, and out of concern their own safety was being compromised by the behavior. Melson, a National Guard sergeant who served in uniform in Iraq and Afghanistan before working for Jorge Scientific, told ABC: 'It was going against everything that we were trying to do over there. It was like a frat house for adults. 'Some of them to the point where they were passing out, . there's firearms laying around, some of them still carrying the firearms . on them.' High: The medical officer appeared totally out of it after injecting himself with Ketamine, the used syringe is shown lying on the floor beside him . The company says it has taken . 'decisive action to correct the unacceptable behavior of a limited . number of employees' and that several of them seen on the video are no . longer employed by Jorge Scientific. In . a short clip of the video provided to ABC, the security manager for the . company can be seen chugging a glass of vodka and staggering around . before starting a wrestling match with another employee. Several bottles of alcohol can be seen sitting on a table in the background. The . use of alcohol or illegal drugs by U.S. contractors in Afghanistan is . prohibited by the military, with the manual describing a . 'zero-tolerance' as personnel must be on alert 24/7 for possible . terrorist attacks. The . video then switches to the company's medical officer after he allegedly . injected himself with Ketamine. The man stares at the camera wide and . glassy eyed, not being able to respond when asked a question. When . asked about the video, medical officer Kevin Carlson admitted to ABC . that he frequently injected himself with narcotics just to 'get away' because the place was such a 'nightmare'. Though . he is no longer employed with them, he revealed there was 'massive drug . and alcohol abuse' at that Jorge Scientific facility, involving . executives, armed security personnel and himself. Whistle blower: John Melson, a National Guard sergeant who served in uniform in Iraq and Afghanistan before working for Jorge Scientific, quit after only three months . Accuser: Melson said he quit because of the way he was treated by their colleagues, who would bully them for not joining in the party, out of sheer disgust, and out of concern that their own safety was being compromised by the behavior . The company's senior on-site executive Chris Sullivan was often the ringleader behind the parties and would try to pressure others into taking part, the suit alleges. He would also allegedly hold blazing bonfires in the outdoor patio despite the fact the location was supposed to be covert. Employees would often throw live ammunition rounds . and fire extinguishers into the flames and watch as they exploded, often . sounding like a real bomb explosion, the whistle blowers claim. Melson said: 'There was nothing covert with bringing all that added attention. Afghanistan is not the time or the place . to be carrying on like that.' Sullivan does not work with Jorge Scientific any more and refused to comment on the allegations. In a statement to ABC News, Colonel Tom Collins, a U.S. Army spokesperson for the International Security Assistance Force, said: 'Clearly, behavior such as that described by ABC News is not indicative of the outstanding work that thousands of contractors and service members perform every day in Afghanistan. 'We are confident that our personnel conduct themselves in ways that makes our nation proud and we should not allow the actions of a few, if determined to be true, to detract from that fact.' Jorge is now conducting their own investigation but said they made management changes to the operation in Afghanistan before the lawsuit was filed. Their statement said: 'These individuals are seeking monetary damages by mis-characterizing . these actions as ""fraud"". 'The company remains confident that the personal misconduct did not . impact the company's contract performance.' If the allegations turn out to be true, it may stoke U.S.-Afghan relations even further and could add to rage over perceived U.S. disrespect for local values. 'This arrogant image that Americans have worldwide, this was feeding right into it,' said Melson.

"By . Amy Oliver . UPDATED: . 12:10 EST, 26 June 2011 . What was life like for Catherine Greig, the long suffering girlfriend of mob boss Whitey Bulger? Before her arrest last week after 16 years on the run with Bulger, the 60-year-old had been by his side for more than three decades. She had seemingly turned a blind eye to his criminal career, in which he allegedly killed 19 people, two of whom may have been her own brothers-in-law. Beloved dogs: Mob boss Whitey Bulger wasn't too fond of moll Catherine Greig's toy poodles, accusing her of caring more about them than him . She also put up with the gangster's . famous fiery temper not to mention an odd jealousy he harboured for her . beloved toy poodles. As . if that wasn't enough Bulger was also leading a double life with her . and his previous long-term girlfriend Teresa Stanley, alternating . between the houses he shared with both women. Neighbours of the couple, who ended up in a modest apartment in Santa Monica, said Greig had been friendly, but guarded. One, . Janus Goodwin, claimed Greig had recently confided over coffee that she . thought Bulger may be suffering from dementia, according to the New . York Times. Ms Goodwin had tried to offer support but it was rebuffed. Life on the run: Greig turned a blind eye to Bulger's alleged criminal activities, but also the relationship he carried on with hid previous girlfriend . 'I’d say, ""Why don’t we do this, why don’t I do that?"" And she said to me, ""I can’t really make any new friends"".' Ms Goodwin also noticed the alleged gangster's temper and how Greig dealt with it. 'When he called out to her, . she acted as if he did this wonderful thing and God had called to her,' she said. Thomas Rudolph, who had known . the couple in Louisiana, told the Boston Globe in 1998 that Bulger . thought 'women should be seen and not heard.' He added Bulger had boasted that all need do was clap his hands and Greig would jump. Wanted: Greig, seen left in an FBI wanted photo from 1990, spent 16 years on the run with Bulger, right, before their arrest last week . Greig, now 60, was well versed in mobster life when she met Bulger. She had married Bobby McGonagle, a Boston firefighter with close family ties to the Irish mafia, in her early twenties. Extreme violence and shootings were a regular occurrence in the South Boston neighbourhood where the couple lived. McGonagle was wounded during a shootout in 1969, while one of his brothers was killed the same year. Another in 1974. He blamed Bulger, who was a member of a rival gang. McGonagle and Greig were divorced a few years later only for her to become embroiled with Bulger - 20 years her senior. If she could overlook his alleged involvement in the deaths of her brothers-in-law perhaps she could turn a blind eye to other things. Fugitives: Bulger, seen left in a courtroom drawing, appeared almost jovial during a hearing last week, in contrast Greig, right, was timid . The FBI was onto Bulger even before he disappeared from the Boston house that Greig bought for $160,000 cash in 1986 and still owns, according to reports. In one recording, taken from bugs the bureau laid in the couple's home, Bulger can be heard screaming that Greig cared more about her poodles than she did for him. Bulger left Boston in 1994 with his previous moll Teresa Stanley. But after being tipped off by a crooked FBI agent that he was about to be charged in a major racketeering indictment a year later, the gangster sped back to Boston. He dumped Stanley in a parking lot, according to book Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the F.B.I. and the Irish Mob, saying: 'I'll call you.' Friendly: Neighbours of the couple in Santa Monica described Greig as impeccably turned out, friendly yet guarded . She never heard from him again. He then picked up Greig and they fled into rural America. Her poodles were left behind. There they led a life of deception. They used aliases when renting apartments and paid cash for everything. Greig underwent multiple plastic surgeries, including breast implants, a facelift and nose job, according to the FBI. But she also liked to keep up appearances. The bureau said she had her teeth cleaned once a month and regularly got her hair dyed in salons. In Grand Isle, Louisiana she even visited a salon owned by a police chief’s . daughter. After her arrest her Santa Monica neighbours told reporters she was . always impeccably dressed with manicured nails; she had let her hair go white, but it was always set. Greig had been friendly, but had never been allowed to get too close to anyone. Even in court last week she seemed timid in contrast to Bulger's almost jovial stance. She glanced over to her lawyer when asked questions and seemed nervous, only smiling for her twin sister Margaret McCusker, who was in the front row. Greig is charged with harbouring a fugitive and faces five years in prison, while Bulger, is charged with 19 murders, extortion, money laundering . and other crimes. If convicted, he faces life in prison or the death . penalty.","FBI recorded Bulger accusing Catherine Greig of caring more for her poodles than him .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 05:28 EST, 8 July 2011 . Failed: Michael Gilbert was repeatedly let down by police and social services . Police and social services repeatedly failed a vulnerable young man who was tortured and imprisoned for a decade before his headless body was found dumped in a lake. Two separate reports into the murder of Michael Gilbert, 26, found he was let down by numerous professionals from early childhood until his body was found dumped in the Blue Lagoon in Arlesey, Bedfordshire, in 2009. He was kept as a slave by a family known to the police, beaten and sexually abused before being killed while his captors claimed his benefit money. Three police investigations involving Michael Gilbert were 'flawed', the Independent Police Complaints Commission has said. Last year, three members of the Watt family were jailed for life for murder, and three others for familial homicide, with a judge branding their crime 'depraved'. Today the IPCC said a Serious Case Review had looked at the consequences of actions by police and other agencies who had contact with Mr Gilbert. The review paints a miserable picture of Mr Gilbert’s childhood. He was in and out of foster care and children’s homes with no one in charge of his well-being. When he left the care system he went to live with the Watt family after meeting James Watt in a children’s home when he was 15. He endured appalling violence at their home including being stabbed, hit with a baseball bat, forced to stand in boiling water and shot at with an air pistol. Evidence given during the criminal trial revealed he had locking pliers attached to his body to lead him around ‘like a dog on a lead’. Depraved: James Watt and Natasha Oldfield were jailed for life for murder . Richard Watt was sentenced to six years in prison and Jennifer Smith-Dennis was jailed for 10 years . Robert Watt was jailed for eight years;  Nichola Roberts was jailed for life . When Mr Gilbert did manage to . escape, the family would contact the Department for Work and Pensions . and state his national insurance number to track where he was signing on . to receive his benefits so they could track him down. James . Watt, 27, his girlfriend, Natasha Oldfield, 29, and his brother . Richard's girlfriend, Nichola Roberts, 22, were jailed for life. James's brother, Robert Watt, 20, and his mother, Jennifer Smith-Dennis, 58, were jailed for eight years and 10 years respectively for familial homicide. A third brother, Richard Watt, 25, who previously pleaded guilty to familial homicide, was sentenced to six years in prison. The gentle giant: Michael Gilbert grew into a naive and vulnerable young man . Police were first alerted to Mr Gilbert after a violent assault in 2002. They were told by Mr Gilbert that he had been abducted by the Watt family in 2007 and again in 2008. But in a serious of deadly blunders police took down the wrong phone number for Mr Gilbert and officers even said he could have been inventing his injuries. Today, the IPCC said police had investigated each of the incidents, but all three inquiries were hindered. The 2002 assault investigation was hampered after it was given inaccurate information from other public services; the Cambridgeshire abduction inquiry was not told Mr Gilbert confirmed to a Bedfordshire officer that he had been taken against his will, having previously denied it. And in Lancashire, the wrong mobile phone number was written down for Mr Gilbert, the IPCC said. The probe only comes after Mr Gilbert's mother contacted the body in July 2010, alleging police had failed to investigate three incidents involving her son. Commissioner Rachel Cerfontyne said: 'This is a tragic case and one where the horrific manner of Michael's death must make it even harder for his loved ones to cope with their loss. 'We looked at specific allegations that the police did not investigate three incidents involving Michael and the Watt family. 'We have found that on each occasion investigations had taken place, but were flawed due to misinformation, failures in communication and human error.' In January 2002 a member of Mr Gilbert's family called Bedfordshire Police to report he had been cut with a knife and shot with a pellet gun. Officers pull a bag containing Michael Gilbert's body from the lagoon . A statement was taken and three members of the Watt family were named as the offenders, but despite efforts by police to investigate, their calls were not returned and Mr Gilbert did not turn up for a meeting. There was no record of him going to hospital when he said he had and social services told detectives he had a history of making false allegations. But the IPCC said it emerged Bedfordshire Police were passed 'inaccurate information in good faith' by social services and the hospital. The false allegations were later found to relate to another Michael Gilbert and the subsequent murder investigation found that instead of making a note on records, the doctor who treated him sent a note to his GP outlining his attendance and treatment. The IPCC found detectives understandably believed Mr Gilbert had invented the causes of his injuries, based on incorrect information from 'normally reliable sources'. In June 2007 Mr Gilbert was with a friend in Cambridge when he was approached by James Watt - one of his killers - and got into a car with him. Michael Gilbert's body parts were found in a prison bag which had been thrown into a lake . His concerned friend contacted police and efforts were made to trace him, then on July 3 Cambridgeshire Police received a request from Bedfordshire Police for his arrest on suspicion of rape. Mr Gilbert was found with Watt in the Arundel Shopping Centre in Luton on July 11. He was arrested and taken to a police station where he was interviewed on suspicion of rape. A Cambridgeshire officer was told he had been arrested and no claims of abduction had been made, so the force closed its missing person and abduction inquiry. But the IPCC said after the interview finished Mr Gilbert told the Bedfordshire detective he had been abducted but would not cooperate with any investigation. He was released, but the allegation of abduction was never passed on to Cambridgeshire Police. The watchdog said if Bedfordshire Police had informed Cambridgeshire of the abduction allegation, it should have resulted in a crime being recorded and the potential gathering of intelligence about the Watt family. 'But given his suggestion that he would not help any investigation, it is impossible to say what would have happened had the information been passed on,' a spokesman said. In the third incident, in January 2008, Mr Gilbert was abducted from outside a job centre in Blackburn when he was with his girlfriend's brother. His girlfriend's family later received several text messages from Mr Gilbert, as well as speaking to him. Officers visited the girlfriend's house and took details of the incident and a contact number for Mr Gilbert. But the wrong number was written down and when it was dialled the man who answered said he was not Michael and did not know him. Officers closed the call thinking he was avoiding contact with the informant's family. Luton Borough Council today welcomed the report's eight recommendations, which include using Mr Gilbert's circumstances in training; sharing the review with partner agencies; and promoting training in assessing mental capacity and decision-making. Chief executive Trevor Holden said: 'While the report clearly states that professionals made the decisions expected of them in following legislative requirements at the time, the council and its partners are determined to learn the lessons from this Serious Case Review. 'We have an action plan in place for each recommendation which will help us improve services to the people of Luton and we hope will also help shape policy on a national level. 'As an adult Michael was not registered as vulnerable because, by law, he was deemed to have had sufficient mental capacity to make his own decisions. 'The support that was offered 20 years ago for Michael in Luton and other children across the country is very different to the services of today,' he said.","Vulnerable Michael Gilbert was stabbed, shot at with an air gun and treated like a dog for a decade .

The U.S. death toll from fungal meningitis linked to potentially contaminated steroid injections has risen by two to 23, with North Carolina reporting its first death. Tennessee's death total in the outbreak rose to eight, the highest state total, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said. States reported 13 new cases of fungal meningitis, raising the total to 281. There are also three peripheral infections caused by injections into joints. Deadly injections: The U.S. death toll from fungal meningitis linked to potentially contaminated steroid injections has risen by two to 23, with North Carolina reporting its first death . Raided: The Food and Drug Administration search the NECC pharmacy in Framingham last week after at least 50 vials of steroids containing fungi linked to meningitis were discovered . The outbreak stems from medications . shipped by the New England Compounding Center (NECC) in Massachusetts. The company faces federal and state investigations and lawsuits over the . tainted medications. Indiana . and New Hampshire reported two new cases apiece, while Virginia, . Tennessee and New Jersey each had three new cases, the CDC said. Health . regulators last week confirmed the presence of the deadly Exserohilum . fungus in vials of the NECC steroid used for pain injections. They estimate that as many as 14,000 people may have been exposed to the contaminated medication. NECC . and its executives face a civil suit in Massachusetts that seeks to . freeze the officers' personal assets. Florida, which has had three . deaths and 17 cases, has barred NECC from doing business in the state. Last Monday, the federal Food and Drug . Administration (FDA) said it had widened its investigation to other . drugs produced by NECC, fearing all of their products' sterility, following a raid on its Massachusetts phramacy. NECC has shipped more than 17,000 vials part of three suspected lots of the drug to clinics in 24 states. Investigation: The pharmaceutical company's Massachusetts headquarters were cordoned off . Confirmed: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have said they have found Exserohilum, a type of fungi, in patients with meningitis . The Massachusetts company faces multiple investigations and lawsuits over the tainted medication linked to the meningitis scare. Experts believe the outbreak will get worse before it gets better. Dr . William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at the Vanderbilt . University Medical Center in Nashville, said: ‘We will see more patients . reporting in ill and we'll have to treat many more.’ Earlier this month, the FDA said that more than 50 vials of steroid treatments from . NECC tested positive for a fungus that causes meningitis. Infections have been detected within two weeks of a patient receiving the NECC-supplied medication methylprednisolone acetate, on average, and up to 42 days afterward. But anyone exposed to the vials of . the steroid  - used to treat back pain and other conditions - should be . vigilant for health problems for several months, CDC officials said. Back pain: Lilian Cary, 67, from Michigan died of meningitis last month, weeks after being treated with steroids . Grieving: Mrs Cary's husband, George, received similar treatment at the same clinic where his wife was treated but said there was 'no evidence' he had contracted meningitis . Local health authorities have contacted over 90 per cent of patients who . may have been exposed. Although . it remains unclear exactly how any medication could have been . contaminated, federal regulators have come under criticism for failing . to prevent the outbreak by closely regulating drug compounding companies . such as NECC, which prepare medications for clinics and doctors largely . outside federal oversight. The FDA has said the law does not give it adequate authority to do so, leaving regulation largely to the states. The pharmacies are owned by Gregory .

The last leg of the fastest road in America opened on Wednesday where the speed limit is 85mph. The final 41-mile stretch of Texas Highway 130 was finally finished after three years of construction. The toll road is intended to alleviate the crowded Interstate 35 corridor between Austin and San Antonio, which are two of the state's largest metropolitan areas. Scroll down for flyover of the new high-speed road . Controversial: The 85 mph speed limit has been approved for a 41-mile-long toll road near the increasingly crowded Interstate 35 corridor between Austin and San Antonio . The new stretch will be from . Mustang Ridge, ten miles south of Austin's international airport, . to Interstate 10, just east of Seguin. A 50-mile stretch bypassing . Austin is already open. Tolls . for cars displaying an electronic toll tag will be about . 15 cents per mile. But no tolls will be collected until November 11. The new stretch of high-speed road has prompted fears that fatalities could increase. 'The research is clear that when speed limits go up, fatalities go up,' said Russ Rader, a spokesman for the nonprofit Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Higher speed limits get people to their destinations faster, Rader said, 'but the trade-off is more crashes and more highway deaths.' A 2009 report in the American Journal of Public Health studied traffic fatalities in the U.S. from 1995 to 2005 and found that more than 12,500 deaths were attributable to increases in speed limits on all kinds of roads. Speed strip: The map shows exactly where motorists can hit the gas . The study also said that rural . highways showed a 9.1 per cent increase in fatalities on roads where . speed limits were raised, but did not cite specific numbers in those . instances. There are no longer any roads in the . U.S. with no speed limit like Germany's autobahn with most top speeds being 75mph. Some highways in rural . West Texas and Utah have 80 mph speed limits. The . Texas Legislature last year approved 85 mph limits for some new . stretches of road.  The . Texas Transportation Commission, which is appointed by Gov. Rick Perry, . approved the 85 mph speed limit at a public meeting on August 30. A . transportation department spokesman said commissioners would not comment . on their decision. Agency officials had previously said they would study the toll road's topography, the speeds that most drivers were reaching, and the safety of access points and cross sections before approving the 85 mph speed limit. 'Safety is our top priority and tests have shown the designated speed is a safe one,' agency spokeswoman Veronica Beyer said. Record speeds: Map shows top speed limits across the U.S . Alan Guckian, who lives in Austin and regularly drives to Seguin to visit family, said he'll likely use the road for convenience and the pleasure of driving fast. 'I would love it,' Guckian said. 'Sometimes it's fun to just open it up.' Steve Marcy sometimes uses another part of the toll road on his daily commute from Round Rock, north of Austin, to his job in San Antonio. The section he drives now has an 80 mph speed limit. Marcy said he'd be comfortable driving 85, but would be concerned about others driving vehicles that are not in good condition. 'A tire blowout (at 85 mph) could be a big hazard,' Marcy said. Chris Lippincott, spokesman for SH 130 Concession Co. that is building the road, said the company is committed to operating a safe highway. 'On any road, drivers hold the key to safety based on traffic, travel conditions and the capabilities of their own vehicles,' Lippincott said. Toll prices have not yet been set for the new section. Marcy predicted the higher speed limit will attract new drivers, but said most won't think it's worth the cost of the tolls. 'For most people I talk to, it's a cost issue,' Marcy said.","Road between Austin and San Antonio will have country's top speed .

"By . Daniel Martin . UPDATED: . 08:48 EST, 7 March 2012 . Civil servants tasked with reducing Whitehall bills have cost taxpayers nearly nine times more than the so-called efficiency savings they made. Government departments have squandered £1.4billion over the past seven years on elaborate programmes to share 'back-office' functions. But the National Audit Office has found that the initiative - launched by Labour - has so far saved taxpayers just £159million. Down the drain: Piles of money have been wasted in a bid to save Government costs. In total, a seven-year programme has saved just £159million at a cost of £1.4billion . That 'saving' is 8.8 times less than the amount they actually spent, which is enough to pay the salary of more than 60,000 nurses. And auditors revealed that it is possible that civil servants may have saved even less than £159million outlined in a damning report.. This is because some ministries were no longer monitoring progress - and those that are doing so report a net cost to the taxpayer. In a damning report, it concluded that a combination of over-expensive IT systems and poor co-ordination between departments and quangos had seen costs soar instead of being slashed. Last night, Labour MP Margaret Hodge, chairman of the powerful Public Accounts Committee, said it was 'a shockingly familiar story of spiralling costs and poor value for money'. The huge projects for government departments and their quangos to share back-office functions - including human resources, procurement, finance and payroll - was enthusiastically launched by Labour in 2004. In its report, the NAO said that private-sector firms typically slash a fifth off their annual spend within five years using similar methods to share back office functions. Labour MP Margaret Hodge said it was 'a shockingly familiar story of spiralling costs and poor value for money' But despite trying a similar approach, central government had managed to undermine the whole point of the programme by increasing costs. In just one shocking entry in the catalogue of waste, auditors discovered that the shared services system set up by the Department for Transport with four of its quangos had so far cost £129million more to set up and run than it had saved. But with the net savings of joint working totalling only £1.3million last year, the watchdog said 'at this rate it would seem difficult to break even'. In one example of the problems to beset the scheme, the report found that the Maritime and Coastguard Agency was blocked from joining the DfT scheme because it did not have security clearance for Whitehall IT systems. Another shared services unit, set up by Research Councils UK, has recorded a net cost to the taxpayer so far of £126million. Shockingly, financial oversight is so lax that two ministries - the Department for Work and Pensions and the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs - have no idea whether their schemes have saved any money at all, because no one has been tracking progress. There was one success story. The Ministry of Justice was saving £33million a year and broke even ahead of schedule - at which point officials there also stopped monitoring performance. The NAO acknowledged that ministers have recognised the problem and put in place plans to shake up the system and impose more central control over the process. But they warned that the reform was 'ambitious and contains significant risk'. Mrs Hodge said: 'The Shared Service Initiative started out filled with good intentions to save money and reduce duplication of back-office functions across Whitehall. This has not been delivered. 'Departments lost sight of their overall objective to save money. Departments ordered tailor-made systems which have cost the taxpayer too much. 'The Cabinet Office is now committed . to bring this initiative back under control but it may be too little, . too late to achieve value for money.' Sharing . back-office functions - also including finance and payroll - was a key . recommendation of the 2004 Gershon Review into slashing Government . running costs. In total, . eight projects have been set up in various departments - with the five . examined by the NAO costing £500million more than budgeted: £1.4billion . rather than the expected £900million. The . NAO said one of the main problems was that the bodies that were . supposed to be pooling their operations stuck rigidly to individual . systems - frustrating the aims of co-operation. It . questioned why officials ordered expensive IT systems without even . considering far cheaper versions which would have been more than . adequate. The National Audit Office acknowledged that ministers have recognised the problem and put in place plans to shake up the system and impose more central control over the process . It also blamed a 'collaborative' culture of letting individual departments have freedom from central control for the failure to produce any of the hoped-for cross-Whitehall sharing. Other factors the NAO highlighted were the need for organisations such as town halls to go through a full European Union tendering process in order to join shared procurement schemes. A system of sanctions against poor performance - and the power for the Cabinet Office to require bodies to sign up to collaboration - would also help, the NAO said. Its head, Amyas Morse, said: 'The initiative for government departments to share back-office functions has suffered from an approach which made participation voluntary and tailored services to meet the differing needs of individual departments. 'The result was over-complexity, reduced flexibility and a failure to cut costs. The new Cabinet Office strategy on shared services acknowledges these issues but, if it is to achieve value for money, it must learn the lessons from past implementation. 'Only in this way can the sharing of back-office functions have a realistic prospect of contributing towards the government's drive to cut public spending in the long-term.' Robert Oxley, campaign manager of the TaxPayers' Alliance said: 'Whitehall bureaucrats appear utterly incapable of taking steps to work more efficiently and save taxpayers' money. It defies belief that civil servants have wasted such incredible sums on an exercise that has failed so spectacularly to save any cash. 'This gross failure suggests an institutionally lax attitude with taxpayers' money that cannot be allowed to continue unchallenged. Hard pressed taxpayers can't afford to keep handing Whitehall a blank cheque only to see it frittered away with nothing to show for it.' Last night a spokesman for the Cabinet Office said: 'We have been clear that the Government will leave no stone unturned in the hunt for savings. The Government has already announced a new approach to shared services that will cut through the complexity in the current system and save money for taxpayers. 'The Government is committed to the correct management of major government projects which previously have not always delivered what they set out to achieve. 'A Major Projects Authority - set up under a mandate from the Prime Minister - was created in 2010 and introduced tough new controls for major projects to manage risk.'","Whitehall spends £1.4bn in seven years finding savings .

"By . Claire Bates . PUBLISHED: . 07:55 EST, 30 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:25 EST, 30 July 2012 . A new prenatal test for Down's syndrome has been given the green light in Switzerland amid controversy over whether this will lead to more abortions. Testing will be available there from mid-August following a decision by the national agency for therapeutic products, according to a Swiss newspaper. The test involves screening pregnant women's blood samples for the presence of foetal Down's syndrome, which is also known as trisomy 21. Pregnancy: The makers of the PrenaTest claim it is 95% accurate in the first trimester . The German-firm LifeCodexx described the procedure, marketed as PrenaTest, as a 'risk-free alternative to common invasive examination methods such as amniocentesis'. It claims that the test can detect 95 per cent of cases if it is performed in the first trimester. The company said demand is high in Switzerland from doctors and expectant mothers. The test will also be marketed in Germany, Austria and Liechtenstein, according to the German-based firm's website. The Swiss national health insurer Santesuisse and the Swiss gynaecological society are happy for the cost of the test to be reimbursed as part of standard medical cover if it proves successful, according to the Neue Zuercher Zeitung am Sonntag. However, the international federation of Down's syndrome organisations has objected to such testing at the European Court of Human Rights. The risks of having a pregnancy that is affected by Down’s syndrome increases as a woman gets older... 15-29 years . 1 in 1,500 . 30-34 years . 1 in 800 . 35-39 years . 1 in 385 . 40-44 years . 1 in 106 . 45 years + . 1 in 30 . The federation, grouping 30 associations in 16 countries, said in June that the Strasbourg court should 'recognise the human condition and protect the right to life of people with Down's syndrome and those handicapped'. Down's syndrome is caused by having an extra copy of chromosome 21. It is a life-long condition that affects a baby's normal physical development and causes moderate to . severe learning difficulties. Women are allowed to have abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy if their baby has Down's. The risk of having a baby with Down's increases as a woman gets older. Invasive procedures currently used for prenatal diagnosis - in the 16th week of pregnancy - pose a one per cent risk of miscarriage. Since 2003 all pregnant women in the UK have been offered screening for Down's syndrome. However, only those who are judged to be 'high risk' can then opt to have a diagnostic test, so not all cases are picked up. From 2007 to 2008, 1,843 cases of Down’s syndrome were diagnosed during pregnancy, and 743 babies were born with the condition. There is currently no screening programme during pregnancy for other conditions such as Cystic Fibrosis or Patau's syndrome.",The test involves screening blood samples from the pregnant woman for the presence of foetal Down's syndrome .

A baby died of whooping cough after doctors failed to diagnose it despite a nationwide campaign among GPs to raise awareness of the symptoms. Sarae Thompson-Haynes – who was just five weeks old – had been seen at two clinics and a hospital without being tested for the illness. She is one of five babies to have died as a result of whooping cough this year. The tragedy came two months after GPs were issued with a Health Protection Agency alert warning that cases had doubled in a year. Tragic: Doctors failed to diagnose baby Sarae Thompson-Haynes with whooping cough despite a nationwide campaign to publicise the symptoms . Yesterday Sarae’s parents, Chelsea Thompson and Todd Haynes, said she might still be alive had tests happened more quickly. Their daughter was born on February 11. At a month old she developed a cough, so they took her to the Hawthorn Drive Surgery in Ipswich where, they say, doctors assured them she was fine. When her condition worsened that evening, her family took Sarae to a nearby out-of-hours GP service, Riverside Clinic. There, they say, a doctor again reassured them all was OK, giving them an inhaler for the baby. Let down: Mother Chelsea Thompson, pictured with Sarae, believes her daughter might be alive today if she had been tested more quickly . The parents claim neither clinic tested for whooping cough. The following day, after Sarae’s condition deteriorated further, Miss Thompson phoned NHS Direct and was advised to go to A&E. She took her daughter to Ipswich Hospital where doctors said she might have bronchitis. She was kept in but the parents say she again was not tested for whooping cough. Precious few weeks: Chelsea with 'cheeky' daughter Sarae, who died in March . Tiny: Sarae Thompson-Haynes was just five weeks old when she died, and was seen at two clinics and a hospital without being tested for whopping cough . Grieving: Chelsea and Todd were left heartbroken after the death of baby Sarae (pictured) Sarae's mother said her baby daughter's death had left her 'angry and devastated' Two days later, on March 18, Sarae experienced breathing difficulties and was transferred to Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge, where tests were finally carried out. She was then referred to Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, where she died on March 21. Test results – which came back after her death – revealed she had been suffering from whooping cough and had succumbed to related health issues. Miss Thompson, 21, said she felt let down by the NHS. ‘We are angry and devastated,’ she said. ‘When I found out she died of whooping cough, I did my own research and realised that there was a massive outbreak this year. ‘I also found out that GPs can test for it. Had they done tests earlier, there is a chance that my little girl would still be here today. They all treated me like a young mother who didn’t know what she was talking about.’ Miss Thompson, who lives in Ipswich . with Mr Haynes, 23, is calling for pregnant women to be immunised . against the infection. The couple plan to make formal complaints to the . clinics and hospitals involved. The HPA says there have been 2,466 cases . of whooping cough in the first six months of this year, already twice . as many as the whole of last year. The condition is an infection of the lining of the airways. The main symptom is a hacking cough followed by a sharp intake of air which sounds like a 'whoop.' Other symptoms include a runny nose, raised temperature, severe coughing fits and vomiting after coughing . The condition usually affects babies and young children. In rare cases it can be fatal . Children are vaccinated against the infection at two, three and four months of age. It can be treated successfully with antibiotics and most people make a full recovery.

Evidence: When Ann Curry asked if Dyer thought she had made a mistake, Dyer pointed to her face and asked, 'What do you think?' The Today show’s Ann Curry asked Ms Dyer this morning if she thought she made a mistake in leaning near the dog’s face, looking back with 20/20 hindsight. ‘What do you think?’ Ms Dyer asked, pointing to her heavily scarred face. ’I got too close.’ ‘It was just the perfect storm,’ she said on the show. ‘We think we know what dogs are saying but we don’t really know.’ The animal lover told Ms Curry that she’s kept a healthy attitude toward the incident, joking that she’d have to slather on the lip liner to get back her cupid’s bow. ‘I’ll have to work (it) really well,’ she laughed. ‘It was a bad morning, but ever since I got in good hands…I knew it was all going to work out,’ Ms Dyer said. ‘I just feel a lot of love.’ Maximus the mastiff was quarantined for ten days and then released to his owner, which is protocol after a bite. In good form: TV anchor Kyle Dyer has had two surgeries since she was attacked by a Mastiff February 8 but looks to be healing quickly . Battle scar: A V-shaped scar can be seen on the anchor's top lip, as well as bite marks on her nose and lower lip . Ms Dyer . of Denver’s KUSA-TV gave her first interview two weeks after the attack, bravely showing . scars on her face, which include a V-shaped scar on her upper lip where . skin had to be grafted. The . anchor told the Denver Post that the first thoughts that went through . her mind after the Argentine Mastiff bit her was: ‘I’m bleeding, and it . had to be on television!’ Despite the painful weeks of recovery, two surgeries, and the long road ahead, Ms Dyer said she feels lucky and calls the attack ‘a fluke.’ ‘It could have been so much worse,’ she said. She was bitten in the face during a live taping of her show February 8. ‘It may seem like a superficial business, but the people out there in Colorado are not superficial,’ she told the Post. She said she’s received an outpouring of support from people who have also been bitten by dogs and who are wishing for a speedy recovery. ‘I just keep reading those letters and know that I’m going to heal. I’m going to be better than ever,’ she said. The news of the attack spread like wildfire around the world.

Ferocious: Though immediate reports said that he was not properly vaccinated, the owners of the dog have put out a statement saying that he was up-to-date with all of his shots . She said her niece read about the attack in the town’s local newspaper. ‘There’s so many different learning things that have come out of this,’ she said.

Over Valentine’s Day weekend, the anchor wrote on her Facebook page that her mouth was stitched shut so the graft over her lips could receive better blood circulation. While more surgeries may be in her future, Ms Dyer won’t know for certain until this summer, as doctors asses her progress. Ms Dyer, who had been working at the Denver station for over 15 years, underwent reconstructive surgery and over 70 stitches after the attack. She said she harbours no ill will toward the dog. ‘It was just an accident,’ she said, saying that she’s glad he is back with his owners.

A number of viewers expressed . concern that the dog would be euthanized as a result of the incident, . which was something they appeared angry about. 'It was clearly human fault. Why should the animal be blamed for both the owner an kyle's mistake? Argentine mastiffs, also known as the . Argentine Dogo, are known as big-game hunters and historically have . gone after wild boars and pumas. While they are now used as pets, they were bred from a rather violent group of dogs. Because of the dogs' violent nature, several areas have banned the breed, including Aurora, Colorado. Aurora borders Denver, where the broadcast took place. The . animal is also banned in New York City public housing, and laws in the . UK allow police to take the dogs away from their owners and prosecute . them. Hope he isn't put down, it would be a crime,' wrote Bruno Naletto. Brendan Flynn echoed that sentiment, writing: 'Lord knows 9News will hear from all of us and alot more if Max is put down.' Unless the dog has rabies - which it is not showing signs of - it will not be put down. Even if the vaccinations are current, the owners will definitely face two charges from Denver Animal Care and Control: a penalty for having the dog bite someone and a second penalty for having the dog off its leash at the time. 'While we normally walk Max on-leash, we understand that by letting him off-leash in an open area away from anyone was still a mistake. We will never walk him off-leash in public areas after this,' the Robinsons said in their statement.

Take up arms: Mark McGowan, 29, also a leader of the group, and his wife Jennifer, 25, are both charged with offering illegal paramilitary training . The arrests over the weekend were the second wave of busts in a major FBI investigation of white supremacist groups in central Florida, the Southern Poverty Law Center reported. The other three arrested over the weekend were: Diane Stevens, 28, Kent McLellan, 22, and Paul Jackson, 25. Christopher Brooks, 27, an ex-con was arrested Monday. Police are also searching for his friend, Richard 'Swamp Nazi' Stockdale. All of them belong to American Front in St Cloud, Florida, an organization that bills its mission as 'religious and cultural preservation of the European people,' according to the Orlando Sentinel.

Marcus Faella has a long history in white supremacist groups in Florida. In the early 1990s, he was a member of another racist group, the Confederate Hammerskins, and was the head of the chapter in Melbourne, Florida. In March, authorities arrested six people in Orlando who were members of the Outlaws Motorcycle Club and the 1st SS Kavallerie Brigade Motorcycle Division, also a white supremacist group. Police say those six people were plotting to blow up buildings and attack their enemies.

America's most hated mother Casey Anthony has piled on the pounds after spending her freedom doing little else but sat in front of her computer eating, it was claimed today. The 26-year-old, who is being forced to face a judge again after being served a court order for a defamation case, was found not guilty of the murder of her two-year-old daughter Caylee 10 months ago, despite a string of inconsistencies in her trial defence. Following her dramatic acquittal she went into hiding in South Florida but rarely leaves her new home in case she's spotted, choosing to sit indoors on the computer and eat instead according to a source. She's back: Sporting short, blonde locks and glasses, Anthony is almost unrecognisable on the October YouTube diary she filmed. She has apparently piled on the pounds since she was freed 10 months ago . Casey Anthony (centre) looks thinner and has dark brown hair as she confers with attorneys Jose Baez, and Dorothy Clay Simser during the murder trial last year . She is unemployed, has little money while probation reports show she recently stopped attending counseling sessions. The source told People magazine: 'Quite honestly, she's gained a few pounds.' However, she has apparently started speaking to her estranged mother Cindy in a bid to get their relationship back on track, although she does not speak to her father. Anthony is also said to be 'annoyed' about having to take the stand again at the Orange County courthouse in January after her attorneys accepted the defamation subpoena.

Gone: Toddler Caylee, whose body was found in woods near Anthony's home in 2008 . The source said: 'She was really ready to move on with her life. This has ruined everything.' But despite being vilified by the public after going into hiding, Anthony has not entirely shied away from publicity. In October she appeared in a video diary that she posted on YouTube. In it she said she was 'making changes for herself', although failed to mention Caylee. It has since been claimed that she become a newborn Christian and was been baptized again in a bid to symbolise a new beginning. However, this apparent new devotion to faith has not stopped her revealing a string of racy photographs of herself.

Anthony is being sued by Zenaida Gonzalez, who shares the name of a fake babysitter 'Zanny the Nanny' who Anthony initially told police had kidnapped Caylee. Anthony admitted fabricating that story. It later emerged that Anthony, whose acquittal last July has been compared to the infamous OJ Simpson case, did not know anyone by that name and the real Miss Gonzalez is not even a nanny. Now Miss Gonzalez is suing her after claiming she lost her job and apartment due to the association with the disappearance of Caylee, whose body was found in woods near Anthony's home in 2008. In hiding: Casey has been spending time with her new boyfriend who she made reference to in the new video . All smiles: Casey Anthony hugs what appears to be her adopted Yorkshire Terrier Smooch in a photo of the 26-year-old . After initially sticking by the claim that the kidnapper had been kidnapped, Anthony's lawyers then insisted at the start of the trial that Caylee had accidentally drowned in the family's swimming pool. It is this primary Inconsistency in her story that has sparked public outrage in the case and forced the defendant into hiding after her release. Her attorneys asked that she not be forced to appear in court, saying she has received death threats since being found not guilty of murder, aggravated child abuse and aggravated manslaughter. She was convicted of four counts of lying to police and is now on probation on an unrelated cheque fraud conviction. Anthony has not been seen in public since her trial, pictured, and has spent most of the last 10 months inside . But, as Anthony had not been seen in public, lawyers for Miss Gonzalez feared she might go missing and decided to track her down. They staked out her home for several days without Anthony appearing to be served a subpoena. Eventually, the defendant's lawyers intervened and said she would attend the court hearing. 'Our investigation team had her whereabouts pinned down,' Miss Gonzalez's attorney Matt Morgan told People magazine. 'Their backs were against the wall, so her attorneys said that they would accept service on her behalf.'","She is broke, unemployed, and has stopped attending counseling sessions .

Vatican police have arrested Pope Benedict XVI's personal butler following an investigation into the leaking of sensitive church documents, it emerged today. In a scenes worthy of a Dan Brown thriller, the butler identified as Paolo Gabriele, 46, was held by gendarmes after a special commission of three top senior cardinals had been appointed by a furious Pope Benedict to identify the source of the leaks which have caused severe embarrassment. Gabriele, who has been at the Pope's side for six years, is one of the German born pontiff's closest members of his inner circle which totals just four lay people and four nuns and he is always at his side - he is so close that he and the nuns who look after him are described as the 'pontiff's family'. The Pope's butler, Paolo Gabriele (bottom L) has been at the Pope's (right) side for six years. He has been arrested on suspicion of leaking internal documents . It is believed that Gabriele, who is known by the nickname Paoletto (little Paul) was held as he arrived for work at the Papal apartments in the Apostolic Palace behind St Peter's and tonight he was being held in custody - the first time in years the Vatican jail had been used. Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said a man had been detained with 'documents in his possession' adding that he was not supposed to have them and he went on to describe him as 'a lay person and not a member of the clergy'. The arrest of Gabriele comes just days after author Gianluigi Nuzzi published a book on the leaked documents called Sua Santita (His Holiness). The Vatican had condemned the book as 'criminal' and the printing of the documents were a violation of the Pope's privacy it said. The Vatican said it has arrested a man caught in possession of secret documents in a bid to crack down on the source of the leak scandal . Nuzzi hit back and said that the files were not private and were documents between states and he added they had been given to him by people who work inside the Vatican and in a reference to the Bible, he said the sources wanted to 'get the moneylenders out of the temple'. Today's arrest came just a month after Pope Benedict turned detective and appointed a special commission to investigate the series of damning and embarrassing leaks of sensitive Catholic Church documents from the Vatican as it still tries to recover from the priest sex abuse scandal. Dozens of documents including private letters to the Pope have found themselves into the hands of the Italian media in what has been dubbed, unsurprisingly, Vatileaks. The documents show how contracts were awarded to favoured companies and individuals and also highlight allegations of internal power struggles with the Vatican's bank known as the Institute for Religious Works. Dozens of documents including private letters to the Pope, right, have found themselves into the hands of the Italian media in what has been dubbed Vatileaks . By coincidence on Thursday the head of the bank, Ettore Gotti Tedeschi, who is already under investigation for money laundering resigned after a vote of no confidence and initially there were rumours that he was the person responsible for the leak of documents. The scandal began in January with the publication of leaked letters from the former deputy governor of the Vatican City archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, in which he pleaded not to be transferred after he had exposed what he said was corruption over the awarding of contracts. Archbishop Vigano was deputy governor from 2009 until last year when he was moved to Washington DC to be papal nuncio in the United States. He had written to the Pope protesting the fact adding that it would bring an end to his efforts to 'clean up' the Vatican. Earlier this year there was even a report leaked which claimed a plot to assassinate Pope Benedict had been uncovered although this was dismissed as ""absurd"" by Father Lombardi who threatened to take legal action against the TV station that screened the documents. The Pope was said to be 'shocked and saddened' at the constant leaks and it led to him appointing the cardinal commission which worked with the Vatican gendarmes and lead to the arrest. Paolo Rodari, an expert on Vatican affairs with newspaper Il Foglio,believes Paolo Gabriele, pictured, has been made a scapegoat . Vatican prosecutor Nicola Picardi was questioning Gabriele and the news was dominating Italian media with many describing the arrest as an 'earthquake within the Holy Sea' although some questioned if he was perhaps being made a scapegoat. Sources said that sensitive Vatican documents had been recovered from father of three Gabriele's home inside the Vatican. But Paolo Rodari, an expert on Vatican affairs with newspaper Il Foglio, was sceptical of his involvement and said: 'I know Gabriele. He is a nice guy but I don't think he would be behind this. I think he may have been imprudent and taken the odd document home but he is not the main person. 'If you ask me he has been made a scapegoat just to satisfy the media. The documents found at his house were from the Pope's personal correspondence but a lot of the leaked documents have come from the Secretary of State's office and he would not have had access to those. 'This is all part of a plot to discredit Pope Benedict and Cardinal (Tarcisio) Bertone (Secretary of State) and I think it has been ordered by senior figures from within the Curia who may have exploited Gabriele but I personally don't think he is the driving force behind Vatileaks.' A Vatican spokesman added that the Vatican did have cells but said he had 'no idea when they were last used'.","Documents also show how contracts were awarded to favoured people .

A university student who was raped after being ‘turfed off’ the last bus home because she was 20p short of the fare, has revealed how she offered to pay the money next time she travelled with the company. A harrowing police interview filmed days after the attack was shown to the jury today, in which the 22-year-old victim told officers she was left 'feeling depressed' after the bus driver refused to wait so she could withdraw extra money from a nearby cash dispenser. Some . of the woman’s injuries -  bruising, swelling and cuts to her face - were . still clearly visible on the film, which was recorded 12 days after she . was attacked on December 10 last year. The law student was left stranded in Nottingham city centre at 3am and after walking for less than a mile, the prosecution claim she was targeted by drink-fuelled Joseph Moran, 19, who then allegedly launched a ‘savage’ attack. 'Turfed off': The woman, 22, was said to have been thrown off the late-night bus in Nottingham because she was 20p short of the bus fare . Today it was revealed to the jury she also said to the driver that her mother could meet the bus at the end of her journey and hand the driver the missing 20p. Both offers were refused by the driver. Recalling how she felt about being stranded alone, the woman told police: 'I remember having a gross sense of injustice that he (the driver) wouldn’t let me on.' The victim said: 'I was . counting out how much money I had. I remember it being 20p short, it . might have been more or a bit less than that. 'I remember having a conversation with the bus driver. I said I was ‘short’ and I said could I get on anyway and he said 'no.' The victim said her last memory of the night was walking towards home alone. She could recall nothing about the attack and her next memory was waking up in hospital about 8.30am the same day. Attack: The woman was allegedly set upon and raped at Nottingham's Forest Recreation Ground . Michael Auty, prosecuting, told the court the . woman 'was effectively turfed off the bus and left stranded in . Nottingham city centre at 3am in the morning.' She then called her mother who agreed to pick her up in the family car. The . victim volunteered to walk a short distance to the edge of the city . centre so her mother would not have to negotiate a one-way system she . was unfamiliar with and to avoid driving on streets busy with late-night . revellers. Nottingham Crown Court heard the victim was grabbed by the neck and dragged in to Nottingham’s Forest Recreation Ground where she was beaten and raped. Her ‘substantial’ injuries included black eyes, a badly swollen face and bruises to her body, breasts and neck. Mr Auty said the injuries were so . severe that when her mother first saw her at hospital, she did not at . first recognise her daughter. Mr Auty described the attack as 'savage and almost devoid of any mercy.' Mr . Auty told the jury that 'in the cruelest of circumstances' the mother . had pulled up on a stretch of the road where she expected her daughter . to be walking, and just yards from where she had been attacked. Tragic: A night bus drives through Nottingham. The victim tried to get on board a similar one but was refused because she was 20p short . The . mother called her daughter’s mobile phone twice and on each occasion . she could hear a male voice making 'grunting' sounds before the line . went dead. Police in a passing patrol car stopped to ask the mother if was all okay and she explained that she was looking for her daughter, who, unbeknown to her and the officers, lay injured nearby. Moments later the defendant ran to the police car and banged on the roof. The court heard he told the officers he had been walking through the park and had come across the victim who had already been attacked. Accused: Joseph Moran, 19, denied rape and wounding at Nottingham Crown Court, and claimed he was the one who spotted the attacked girl . He . told the officers 'you had better come quick. I think a girl has been . raped or something.' He claimed to the officers that mud and the woman’s . blood were transferred to his body and clothes when he tried to help . her to her feet. The girl was found nearby sat with her knees pulled tight to her chin and she was naked from the waist down. When . told he was being arrested on suspicion of attacking the woman,the . defendant replied: 'This is what you get for trying to help someone.' Tests . showed the defendant was around two-and-a-half times over the legal . drink-drive limit. There were also traces of cannabis and cocaine inside . his body. Mr Auty alleged Moran panicked when he spotted the nearby police car and quickly fabricated his story. 'He made out he was her saviour, her knight in shining armour,' said Mr Auty. The . victim told how she and fellow students celebrated the end of exams . with a lunch-time glass of mulled wine at a Christmas fair in . Nottingham’s Old Market Square. She then returned home and helped her . mother with the weekly supermarket shop before returning to Nottingham . to continue her end-of-examination celebrations. The . student watched friends in a band play at a bar before moving on to a . house party and ending the night at a city centre club. Moron, of Sneinton, Nottingham, denies rape and wounding.

Under-fire Tory party co-chairman Baroness Warsi could have profited from parliamentary expenses by billing the taxpayer up to £165 a night for accommodation despite staying at a Premier Inn for less than half the price. The cabinet minister claimed £12,247 in overnight subsistence costs related to her House of Lords attendance between October 2007 and March 2008, which equates to her receiving the maximum £165.50 on 74 occasions. But sources told The Sunday Times that during this period she stayed on a number of occasions at the Premier Inn in Wembley, London, paying about £75 a night. Warsi, 41, did not break parliamentary rules by using a cheap hotel, but by claiming the maximum allowance - and pocketing the difference - she leaves herself open to accusations of profiting from expenses rather then using them to cover costs. Expenses: Baroness Warsi claimed £12,247 in House of Lords overnight expenses between October 2007 and March 2008 . Fellow peer Lord Hanningfield, jailed for falsely claiming overnight House of Lords expenses, said: 'I don't want to say anything against Baroness Warsi but, as I said at my trial, 85 per cent of peers were claiming the full allowances.' The news comes a week after allegations that Warsi had claimed up to £2,000 in House of Lords expenses while staying rent-free at the Acton home of GP and Tory party member Wafik Moustafa. Warsi has admitted she spent occasional nights at the property after she entered the Lords in October 2007 and before she moved into a two-bedroom flat she bought in Wembley. She has said she stayed there on about 12 occasions as a guest of Tory official Naweed Khan, who later became her special adviser. Controversy: Wafik Moustafa at his home in which Baroness Warsi briefly stayed shortly after she entered the Lords . The peer denies these allegations and has referred herself to Paul Kernaghan, the Lords Commissioner for Standards, who is expected to carry out an investigation. Warsi has also been criticised . for failing to declare to Parliament that she had been receiving . thousands of pounds in rent since moving out of her Wembley flat. She additionally faces the prospect of a police probe, after the Met received a complaint from a member of the public. Warsi said: 'I believe the membership of the House of Lords is a . privilege, which is why I have at all times sought to ensure that my conduct, . including claims for overnight accommodation and subsistence, is in accordance . with both the letter of the law and the spirit of the rules. 'That is why I have . referred the allegations relating to my claims for overnight allowances to the . Commissioner for Standards in the House of Lords, thereby enabling the . Commissioner to carry out an investigation that would otherwise be . time-barred.' Separately, the Mail On Sunday today revealed that Warsi made two trips to the Middle East that were funded by the Saudi Arabian government. Both trips were to Saudi Arabia and Warsi was joined on one of them by her husband. She has declared both trips in the House of Lords register but no costs have been disclosed. Warsi added that her husband had 'met his own costs'. So far, the prime minister has backed Warsi despite calls for her to resign.","Peer says her expenses claims are 'in accordance with the letter and the spirit of the rules'

"By . Ian Garland . UPDATED: . 02:02 EST, 11 June 2012 . A new search for missing aviator Amelia Earhart will resume next month, 75 years to the day after she disappeared over the Pacific. A research team will set off for the remote island of Nikumaroro to try and establish what happened to the legendary pilot after she vanished on July 2 1937. It's the tenth time in 23 years the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR) will have searched the island for clues about Earhart's disappearance - but this time they'll be looking specifically for crash debris. Enduring riddle: American avirator Amelia Earhart, posing by her plane in Long Beach, California, in 1930, disappeared while flying over the Pacific in 1937 . Nikumaroro Island: Researchers will scour the island for clues and crash debris . Earhart, then 39, was on the final stage of an an ambitious round-the-world flight along the equator in a twin-engine Lockheed Electra when she and navigator Fred Noonan disappeared. The holder of several aeronautical records, including the first woman to cross the Atlantic by air, Earhart had set off from New Guinea to refuel at Howland Island for a final long-distance hop to California. In what turned out to be her final radio message, she declared she was unable to find Howland and that fuel was running low. Several search-and-rescue missions . ordered by then-president Franklin Roosevelt turned up no trace of . Earhart or Noonan, who were eventually presumed dead at sea. Conspiracy theories flourished. One contended that Earhart was held by Japanese imperial forces as a spy. Another claimed she completed her flight, but changed her identity and settled in New Jersey. TIGHAR is working on the hypothesis that the duo reached Gardner Island, then a British possession and now known as Nikumaroro, and managed to survive for an unknown period of time. Nikumaroro, uninhabited in Earhart's time, and a mere 3.7 miles (six kilometers) long by 1.2 miles (two kilometers) wide, is about 300 miles (480 kilometers) southeast of Howland Island. Missing: Earhart and Fred Noonan, left, before they set off on their doomed flight. Right: Earhart as a young pilot . This year's TIGHAR expedition will see about 20 scientists depart Hawaii to explore over 10 days both the island and an underwater reef slope at the west end of the island. 'This time, we'll be searching for debris . from the aircraft,' TIGHAR's founder and executive director Richard . Gillespie, himself a pilot and former aviation accident investigator, revealed. They will be equipped with a multi-beam sonar to map the ocean floor, plus a remote-controlled device similar to the one that found the black boxes from the Rio-to-Paris Air France that crashed into the South Atlantic in 2009. If debris is found, it will be photographed and its location carefully documented for a future expedition, Gillespie said. Sustaining the search are clues . worthy of detective story, including items from the 1930s previously . discovered on the island such as a jar of face cream, a penknife blade, . the heel of a woman's shoe and a bit of Plexiglas. Skeletons of birds apparently cooked over a campfire have also contributed to the mystery, and settlers who reached Nikumaroro after 1937 have spoken of the existence of aircraft wreckage. Bone fragments have meanwhile been subjected to DNA testing that turned out to be inconclusive, said Gillespie, who remains hopeful that parts of Earhart's Electra remain to be found. The US government is lending technical and diplomatic support to the TIGHAR effort, budgeted at $2 million and otherwise privately funded. A documentary is due to be broadcast on the Discovery cable television channel. Celebrated: Earhart posing in Southampton after completing a successful flight . Intrigue: In her day, Earhart was extremely popular, but her mysterious death has kept that fame alive more than 75 years later . The most widely accepted theory is that the aeroplane ran out of fuel and ditched in the sea. There have been several searches by many different professionals eager to solve the mystery, but none have been proven. Another popular theory is that they landed on the island of Nikumaroro in the Pheonix Islands, 350 miles southeast of Howland Island and fended for themselves for serveral months until they succumbed to injury or disease. Improvised tools and bits of Plexiglas that are consistent with that of an Electra window were found on the island. A few theorists reckon that she Earhart was spying on Japan and had been captured and executed. This theory has been discounted by the American authorities and press. A rumour claimed that she was one of many women sending messages on Tokyo Rose, an English-language Japanese propaganda station designed to attack the Allies' morale. An Australian aircraft engineer said he found a map that showed Earhart and Noonan may have turned round to try and refuel but crashed before getting to an airstrip. The most whacky theory is that she was still alive and had a different identity. A woman fron New Jersey successfully sued for $1.5m in damages from the author of a book who pursued this theory.","New search for the wreckage will start on July 2 - 75 years after Amelia Earhart set off on her doomed trip .

The actors, who met 20 years ago and went on to marry and have a child, are appearing together as a couple for the first time in a serious case of art imitating life. 'The play is about a marriage that is at . least 20 years old. It's about a marriage that has children,' Ms NcNenny, 50, said of their respective parts, and instant intimacy. 'If we come in with people we didn't know, there's a . period of time before you even start to build with that. With us, a lot . of steps got cut out of the process.' Chemistry: Boyd Gaines and Kathleen McNenny, who met 20 years ago and went on to marry and have a child, are appearing together as a couple for the first time in a serious case of art imitating life . New York theatergoers be . able to see the husband-and-wife team up close as they star in Manhattan . Theatre Club's An Enemy of the People, a new version of Henrik .

Mr Gaines plays a public-minded doctor in a small town who discovers the . water supply for the public spa is contaminated and may have made . tourists - the community's economic lifeblood - ill. But his efforts to . clean up the mess pit his ethics against political cowards and the . media. His family suffers - including his wife, played by Ms McNenny. Ms McNenny said during a joint interview: 'You always want to work with people that are better than you. Not only do I get to work with someone who is better - who's really, really great to be onstage with - but I also feel safe. I don't feel intimidated by it because it's my husband.' However her four-time Tony Award-winning husband, 59, takes issue with that. He said: 'I'm certainly not better than she is. God knows that is not true. I'm always dumbstruck by how creative Kathy is and how much she brings to the table.' 'I don't feel intimidated by it because it's my husband' Fitting for a pair of actors, Gaines and McNenny first became smitten while onstage. They had been paired as the lovers Luciana and Antipholus of Ephesus in the 1992 Public Theater production of William Shakespeare's The Comedy of Errors in Central Park. They had briefly met before while shooting the 1991 miniseries A Woman Named Jackie, but it was really when The Comedy of Errors director Caca Rosset set up private meetings with his cast that they first connected. Mr Gaines went first to meet Mr Rosset and when he came out, Ms McNenny was waiting her turn. The director reintroduced them and asked the pair, 'So, do you think you can fall in love?' Opening soon: The husband-and-wife team star in Manhattan Theatre Club's An Enemy of the People, a new version of Henrik Ibsen's play opening September 27 on Broadway . 'We both shrugged our shoulders and went, ""Well, sure. That's our job. We were going to act that,""' Mr Gaines recalled. Ms McNenny, too, was game: 'I said, ""Sure, I'll fall in love with him. Fine.""' And after the show ended, they began dating. Over the years, they have shared a stage only rarely. There was a two-night benefit on Broadway in 2002 and a play at the Westport Country Playhouse a year later. They also were in A.R. Gurney's  Sylvia in 2010 at the George Street Playhouse in New Brunswick, N.J. But that's about it, until now. Why so  few times sharing a stage? 'First of all, Boyd can do musicals and I can't,' said Ms McNenny. 'Well, they let me do them occasionally. I don't know if I can do them,' says her husband, modestly.

He said: ‘Barclays needs to operate . commercially and that includes setting remuneration for our executive . directors appropriately.’ Data provided by Barclays shows that £100 invested in shares in 2006 was worth just £29 at the end of 2011. RBS and Lloyds, backed with £66billion of taxpayers’ money, sneaked their pay reports out late in the day. Stephen Hester, the chief executive of RBS, stands to get a total package of £7.9million.

"By . James Tozer and Louise Eccles . UPDATED: . 12:25 EST, 22 July 2011 . Rebecca Leighton, wearing a cowboy hat, poses with a toy gun in her mouth at a fancy dress party. Detectives have been given until 9pm tonight to continue to question the nurse on suspicion of murdering three patients . As the toll in the saline murder inquiry rose to five yesterday, detectives were set to review dozens of other deaths at Stepping Hill Hospital. The inquiry escalated as another of the 14 patients whose saline is suspected of having been tampered with, 83-year-old Derek Weaver, died yesterday morning. Tonight police named Vera Pearson, 84, as the fifth victim to be linked to the investigation. She was not one of the 14 patients police . initially believed had been treated with 36 vials of saline contaminated . with insulin, raising fears there could be yet more victims. The pensioner's family said they wanted to be left alone to grieve in peace. Her death on July 14 was referred to detectives by a coroner earlier this week because of her low blood sugar level. Police say saline solution at the hospital was contaminated with insulin, which can cause low blood sugar. A further patient, a 41-year-old  man, has improved slightly but remains 'poorly'. A police source said: 'Although the focus of our investigation is . the deaths that have occurred this month, we will be reviewing a number . of deaths at the hospital over the last few weeks and months to see if . there is anything suspicious about them. Detectives have been given until 9pm . tonight to continue to question nurse Rebecca Leighton on suspicion of . murdering three patients, George Keep, 84, Arnold Lancaster, 71, and . Tracey Arden, 44. Victim: Vera Pearson, 84, who is the fifth person whose death is being linked to allegations of sabotage at Stepping Hill Hospital . Yesterday her fiancé, friends and family took to the internet to protest her innocence, with her fiancé's mother writing: 'We all believe in you.' The alarm was raised last Tuesday when an experienced nurse reported a higher than normal number of patients with 'unexplained' low blood sugar levels. Concerns that controlled drugs were not . kept securely on the wards at the centre of the current inquiry were . highlighted by an internal report earlier this year. The clinical audit, seen by the Daily . Mail, found that cupboards in which medicines were stored on wards A1 . and A3 were not routinely locked. It also revealed that staff on ward A3 did not check their supplies of controlled drugs on a daily basis. The . proportion of keys to locked medicine cupboards held by the appropriate . staff had dropped from 100 per cent the previous year to 84 per cent. Last night the trust said it had reacted by retraining staff, replacing faulty locks and redistributing keys. Security at the hospital has been drastically increased, with medics working in pairs to minimise the chance of foul play. None . of the deaths has so far been definitively linked to insulin . contamination and while further toxicology reports are awaited, police . are classifying all five as 'suspicious'. Murder probe: Derek Weaver, 83, is the latest . patient to die at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport, where it is . alleged saline drips have been sabotaged. Nurse Rebecca Leighton has . been arrested on suspicion of murder . Victims: Tracey Arden, 44, George Keep, 84, and Arnold Lancaster, 71, who died at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport . Police question visitors to Stepping Hill Hospital . Chameleon: Miss Leighton, who was arrested in a dawn raid, shows off her different looks on camera . Miss Leighton, 27 - herself born at Stepping Hill - was described by colleagues as 'dedicated'. She was arrested at 6am on Wednesday in the flat she shares with her fiancé Tim Papworth, 28, a 15-minute walk from Stepping Hill. Her Facebook profile revealed she enjoyed getting drunk on wine on days off and dreaded night-shifts at the hospital lasting as much as 14 hours. Assistant Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said that the deaths of two elderly patients were being linked to the ongoing investigation . Last night Miss Leighton's uncle, Geoffrey Sweetman, 54, a Cadbury's worker of Bourneville, Birmingham, said: 'Becki is a lovely girl, she's good-hearted, a friendly and loving family member. 'I do not believe she is a murderer.' Miss Leighton was inspired to become a nurse by her mother Lynda, a nurse trainer at Stepping Hill, ex-colleagues said. Rebecca Leighton's Facebook pages tell of a frantic social life that helped her cope with the stress of work. Fun loving: Miss Leighton poses for pictures during nights out. Police have searched her Stockport flat . Her Facebook page is littered with entries about not looking forward to work . Retired senior staff nurse Valerie Rowlinson, 61, said: 'Initially she was a healthcare assistant but she desperately wanted to make the step up so she did the Open University nursing degree to become a fully-qualified nurse. 'I always found her very committed and diligent. She is a good nurse in my opinion and the whole thing has left me shocked.' Miss Leighton - who was registered as a nurse in 2008 - is understood to have temporarily held an acting position as ward sister. Messing around: The nurse has been described as a 'polite and caring' The latest suspected victim, Derek Weaver, was a retired businessman who lived near the hospital. He is understood to have deteriorated suddenly after suffering a serious low blood sugar episode on July 11, the day before the inquiry was launched. Last night Mr Weaver's sister, Lynda Bleasdale, said she was horrified by the allegations. 'I'm absolutely sick that anybody could do that,' she said. 'Everyone in the hospital has said what a charming, lovely gentleman he is. The staff have been absolutely wonderful with him.' Greater Manchester Assistant Chief Constable Ian Hopkins stressed that there had been no further acts of contamination at the hospital since the start of inquiries. 'As with the deaths of George Keep, Arnold Lancaster and Tracey Arden, the cause of this man and woman’s death is not known and it is important we do not lose sight of this fact,' he said. Mr Hopkins predicted that police would be asked to investigate other deaths at the hospital. The 'fast-moving' investigation has revived memories of Beverley Allitt, who was convicted of murdering four children and trying to kill nine others at a Lincolnshire hospital in the early 1990s. She injected some of her victims with insulin. Party-loving: Rebecca Leighton's social life was catalogued on Facebook . Friends and family of Rebecca Leighton turned to the internet to protest her innocence. After the nurse's party-loving lifestyle came under scrutiny due to her numerous entries on social networking websites, they launched a campaign of support. Pleading with her to stay strong, they said they did not believe she could have carried out the murders. And her fiancé, Tim Papworth used his father's Facebook profile to thank everyone for their support. His mother, Heather Papworth, wrote: 'Innocent, we all believe in you bekki, love you loads. No she hasn't done it and she will be holding her head high, love you bekki xx'. Friend Leah Hunt wrote: 'The most kind hearted person in the world ur fantastic person great friend n brilliant nurse love u loads becki n don't believe one word of it ur amazin keep ur chin up babe we are all thinking of u honey stay storng ur in my heart and prays. X' Using her nickname, Spuggy, Sarah Warburton wrote: 'Can't stop thinking about what your going through Spuggy! They couldn't be more wrong'. And friend Diane Rothwell wrote: 'Becki, the news is totally insane ... You would never hurt a fly and I cannot understand this.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 10:07 EST, 8 July 2011 . A man who killed his girlfriend and beat her corpse so savagely her mother was not allowed to see her remains hung himself before he was due to face a court. Blake Ross, 36, a 6ft 3in tall former weight trainer, from Two Mile Ash, near Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, was found dead in his cell. He had been due to stand trial for the murder and mutilation of his partner, mother-of-one Kim Jeffery, also 36, after she ended their relationship. Killer: Blake Ross, left, committed suicide in his cell where he was waiting to stand trial for the brutal murder of partner Kim Jeffery, right . Out-of-control Ross killed Ms Jeffery as her nine-year-old daughter slept upstairs by punching her in the face and stabbing her several times with a kitchen knife. He then disfigured her dead body, beating her face so savagely her eyes were forced from their sockets and her teeth smashed into her throat. Ms Jeffery's distraught mother, Hazel Simpson, 62, described her killer as 'totally evil'. 'Kim was so badly mutilated I was not even allowed to see her body,' she said. 'He had punched her teeth and palate down her throat, her eyes into their sockets and broke her jaw and cheekbones. 'It was totally evil. She phoned me in tears that day and said, 'Mum, he's so possessive... I am frightened of him. 'Although we begged her to come and stay with us she refused, insisting later she was OK and that Blake was in a better mood and had agreed to leave in the morning.' Miss Jeffery, who ran her own cleaning business, ended her relationship with accountant Ross on April 3 this year and told him to leave her home in Milton Keynes. But Ross brutally murdered mother-of-one Kim on April 10. He then pummelled her face, broke her jaw and cheek bones and left her body completely disfigured. Police were called to the home they shared at 8.46pm and Ross was arrested at the scene. HMP Bedford: Ross was on remand here when he committed suicide . Now Ms Simpson has revealed how Ross became so jealous he burned her daughter's favourite dresses and threaten her for just talking to other men. 'Kim loved meeting people, dancing and playing sport. She was always busy. But Blake hated her doing anything without him,' she said. 'If she so much as talked to another man he gave her an evil stare or even beat them up. 'He burned her favourite dresses but I only learned this after she died. 'We cannot forgive Blake Ross and his death is scant comfort for the loss we feel. 'He was an evil man who killed my beautiful daughter and he deserves to be dead.' She revealed how Ross would ring Ms Jeffery over ten times an hour whenever she went out for drinks or meals with friends. 'Kim and her friends booked a family holiday with their children before she met him,' said Ms Simpson. 'When she told Blake he tried to book into the hotel next door, Kim just thought he was being over protective. 'Even when she went on the school run, the week before she died, he hobbled after her with his leg in plaster. It just wasn't normal. 'Some people say it would be better if he'd suffered in prison for years but I don't agree. We feel that justice has been done. 'Although she is gone, Kim will live forever in the collective heart of our family, but sadly her young daughter is now forever without a devoted, wonderful mother.' Post-mortem tests carried out at the time of Kim's death showed that she died from stab wounds and 'blunt force trauma'. Ross, of Tavelhurst, Two Mile Ash, admitted manslaughter but pleaded not guilty to murder and was due to face trial at Luton Crown Court on October 11. However, he was found dead in his jail cell at Bedford Prison at 5.45am on June 30. A Thames Valley Police spokesman said: 'Thames Valley Police can confirm Blake Ross was found dead in his cell at HMP Bedford at 5.45am on June 30. 'The matter is not thought to be suspicious and a post-mortem will be carried in due course.'","Blake Ross killed Kim Jeffrey as her daughter, nine, slept upstairs .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 15:46 EST, 4 April 2012 . He’s been tied to three paramours, but that doesn’t stop former Google CEO Eric Schmidt from speaking amorously about his current wife. In an extraordinary step, the Google exec publically backed his wife Wendy at a UC Berkeley alumni function two weeks ago. In his speech, Schmidt lavished on what an important decision it was to attend the research university –partially for his education, but in large part because that’s where he met current wife Wendy. Scroll down for video . Sign of affection: Speaking at UC Berkeley, Google exec Eric Schmidt gestured to his wife during his speech . Costly split: Chairman of Google Eric Schmidt, centre, and his wife Wendy Schmidt, right, are set to have the second most expensive divorce in history; they are pictured with Arianna Huffington, left . Schmidt, who is worth nearly . $7billion, spoke while accepting the award for 2012 alumnus of the year. He got his M.S. in 1979, and his Ph.D. in 1982 from the university. Acknowledged: Eric Schmidt gestured to his wife Wendy at the public speaking event . Mr Schmidt began his address commenting on the beautiful California weather, but soon transitioned into International House. ‘It is a great institution, and where . I met my wife, Wendy,’ he said, gesturing with a hand and smiling at . Wendy, who was apparently sitting off camera. ‘Pretty important decision to come to Berkeley, and I-House,’ he said. According to a report by Gawker, the Google chairman has had at least two paramours in the past – Marcy Simon, Kate Bohner. The New York Post says he also had a third - Lisa Shields. All three worked as TV news hands and then went into careers in public relations, according to Gawker. The Post states that he is currently dating Ms Shields, and has been for more than a year. As Gawker pointed out, the . sentimental, romantic gesture to his wife was remarkable in part because their . relationship is said to be on the rocks. In February, the New York Post reported that the Google exec was expected to be heading for a divorce costing up to $1.5billion - the second most expensive in history. The Post reported that the Google . executive chairman is planning to sell 2.4million of his shares in the . company to help pay for his split with wife Wendy as he continues a year . and half long liaison with Manhattan beauty Lisa Shields. Mr Schmidt is looking towards a . ‘transition and an amicable separation and settlement’ with the mother . of his two children, but needs the extra cash to pay for it according to . the Post. Paramours? Schmidt has been linked to Lisa Shields, left, Kate Bohner, centre, and Marcy Simon, right . If it all . goes to his wife it would mean Schmidt, the 136th richest man in the . world, would be giving away a quarter of his $6.2billion fortune to . Wendy, to whom he has been married for 13 years. During . that time, Schmidt has overseen Google as it has become one of the . biggest companies on Earth with annual profits of $9.7billion. A source said: ‘There are many . reasons why he’s selling shares, mostly business reasons, but he’s also . working towards a transition and an amicable separation and settlement . with his wife. ‘They are both very private, so they’re quietly dividing up assets without drawing attention. There’s been no paperwork filed.’ An aerial view of Schmidt's $20million Montecito mansion last August as it was being set up for Kim Kardashian's wedding . Schmidt paid a reported $72million for the 195-foot megayacht Oasis, pictured here . If the divorce goes through then Schmidt’s property empire would be among the assets up for division including his $20million mansion with four acres of land in Montecito, California he bought from U.S. TV show host Ellen Degeneres in 2007. The site has landscaped gardens, a tennis court, a swimming pool and spa, a 5,000 square foot main house with four bedrooms and six bathrooms. Millions of viewers were treated to an inside look at the Montecito property when Kim Kardashian rented it for her wedding last year. Schmidt also has a mansion home in Nantucket in Massachusetts where he and his wife used to spend their summers in addition to a home in Atherton, near Google's Silicon Valley headquarters. Schmidt's home in Atherton is worth $3.7million and has five bedrooms and three-and-a-half bathrooms covering a total of 4,840 sq ft. The neighbours include actress Shirley Temple and Grateful Dead singer Bob Weir. Schmidt also owns the 195-foot super yacht Oasis which he bought for $72.3million. The boat its said to be one of the . ‘highest spec yachts ever built’ with its own pool and gym that can be . converted into a disco. Love: Schmidt and Lisa were seen together last summer in The Hamptons. he bought her a Dutch Warmblood show-jumping horse as a token of his affection (file photo) The divorce would also shed a light on the exact nature of Schmidt’s marriage, which has been the subject of speculation for years. Schmidt’s current girlfriend is Council on Foreign Relations executive Lisa Shields, 46, who he has been seeing for a year-and-a-half. The two were seen together last . summer in the Hamptons and he has bought her a Dutch Warmblood . show-jumping horse as a token of his affection. Schmidt and Shields were seen cruising on Oasis in the Caribbean and the South of France last summer. Shields, . a divorced mother, used to be a producer at ABC News and was linked to . Andrew Cuomo shortly before he began dating Sandra Lee. Schmidt . stepped down as chief executive and chairman after ten years in the . role last April and was given a $100million parting gift. 1. Rupert Murdoch and Anna Murdoch: $1.7 billion . 2. Formula 1 tycoon Bernie Ecclestone and Slavica Ecclestone: $1.2 billion. 3. Saudi businessman Adnan Khashoggi's and Soraya Khashoggi:  $874 million . 4. Tiger Woods and Elin Nordegren: $750 million as part of their divorce settlement. 5. Casino operator Stephen Wynn and Elaine Wynn: $740 million . Wendy Schmdit has a master's in journalism from Berkeley and has played a prominent role in the Eric Schmidt Family Foundation, which campaigns for responsible use of natural resources. The most expensive divorce in history was between media mogul Rupert Murdoch and his wife Anna, which cost him a reported $1.7billion. Currently the second most expensive was between Formula 1 tycoon Bernie Ecclestone and his model wife Slavicia which was a reported $1.2 billion. A Google spokesman said in February: ‘The sale is part of a standard selling procedure to allow for diversification.’ Divorce lawyer Ayesha Vardag said that Schmidt could potentially lose even more than quarter of his wealth as under California law anything earned during a marriage is split 50 / 50. She said: 'The principle is known as community property and it is fairly cut and dried - anything earned by either party during the marriage is split down the middle. 'The biggest thing that will be argued about in a divorce like this is not so much the proportion of a husband's money but what is in the pot. 'Liquidity will be a big issue and he will either have to borrow against the value of his stocks in Google or sell them, which would be destabilising for him and the company. 'I would be advising Mr Schmidt to get a realistic assessment about the worth of Google whilst trying to make the assessment it as conservative as possible - and keep things civilised. 'If he has a pre-nup, which are valid in California, it will significantly limit the amount his wife is entitled to.'","Speaking at a UC Berkeley alumni event, Eric Schmidt talked about how he and his wife met .

Marc Kirvin leaves Manchester Magistrates Court where he pleaded guilty to stealing the handbag of a woman knocked down and decapitated by a lorry . A thief stole the handbag of a hit-and-run victim as her decapitated body lay in the road, a court heard yesterday. Marc Kirvin, 46, picked up the bag, which contained £1,600 in cash, minutes after grandmother Sawari Ashraf, 62, was hit by a lorry. The impact propelled Mrs Ashraf’s bag 400ft from her body and Kirvin claimed he did not know an accident had occurred. He told police he was looking for work that day and had taken the money ‘because of greed’. His arrest came after CCTV pictures were published of the theft – during which he also took the dead woman’s shoes – on March 29 in Longsight, Manchester. The grisly nature of the incident also led to ghoulish onlookers taking sick pictures of the scene and posting them on the internet. Jennifer Baines, prosecuting, said she accepted it was plausible that Kirvin, who was travelling in a different lorry, may not have been aware of the crash as there had been little reaction by motorists in that area and there had been no obvious debris. She added: ‘The most aggravating feature in this case is because he took the handbag, police had no identification and the lady’s family weren’t aware for two days that their mother and their grandmother had been taken from them.’ Officers had to trawl missing persons’ records and issue several public appeals for information before finally identifying Mrs Ashraf’s remains. Opportunist: Kirvin clutches the handbag containing £1,600 as he approaches one of the dead woman's shoes lying on the ground . Grasping: Kirvin reaches down for Mrs Ashraf's handbag, which was thrown some 130 metres from her body after she was hit by the lorry . Shameless: Marc Kirvin, 46, is seen on CCTV carrying the decapitated woman's shoes. A witness said a man calmly picked up the footwear and handbag - which where catapulted 100 yards from her body . Sarwari Ashraf, 62, was killed instantly on when she was struck by the lorry in Manchester . Since the family are Muslim, they were said to be deeply troubled at the fact they could not bury her body as soon as possible, which is  traditional. Their statement concluded: ‘Our family cannot express the stress, anxiety, heartache and sadness this has caused.’ Manchester magistrates’ court heard Kirvin was arrested after an appeal on Crimestoppers was answered. His wife Alison said he felt guilty taking the money and was going to spend it on their children at Christmas, but she said she had persuaded him to hand it in to the police, which he planned to do. Kirvin, of Altrincham, Greater  Manchester, yesterday admitted theft and was warned he faced imprisonment. District Judge Wendy Lloyd adjourned the case until June 20 for reports. She said: ‘The defendant must have known that losing that sum of cash would be massively distressing to anyone. He must be prepared for the worst.’ A lorry driver was arrested on suspicion of causing death by careless driving but has been freed on bail pending further inquiries.

A man, who is believed to be a 21-year-old university student, has started a dangerous craze around Britain's campuses - downing bottles of alcohol as quickly as possible on camera. In a series of videos, which have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times across the world, the man who is thought to study at the University of Leeds, covers his face with a  ski-mask to 'protect his identity.' He then completes various dangerous alcohol challenges, which have been deemed by one alcohol charity as both 'foolish' and 'embarrassing.' But now his videos have sparked so many copycat clips that the student even faked his own admission to hospital to warn others of the dangers after realising he was 'sending out the wrong message.' Scroll down for video (warning: explicit language) Challenge: A man, who is believed to be a 21-year-old university student, has started a dangerous craze around Britain's campuses - being filmed downing alcohol as quickly as possible . The Leeds Student newspaper reported that the student drunk 'close to 160 units of alcohol on screen in just two weeks -  almost four times the maximum suggested amount for that period of time.' In one video, filmed in a kitchen with an audience, he drinks a pint of vodka in seven seconds, while in another - deemed 'the rainbow challenge' - he downs a bottle of red wine, a bottle of white wine and a bottle of rose within a minute. Since he began posting the videos as 'Man Vs Booze' on YouTube just over a month ago, his online following has grown each time he produced another 'episode' - each more risky than the last. When some users commented that he may be drinking water, the man lit a pint of sambuca in front of the camera before downing it. Binge drinking: Leeds Student website reported that the 21-year-old decided things had to stop earlier this month and pretended he had been admitted to hospital for an alcohol related incident . Dare: When some users commented that he may be drinking water, the man lit a pint of sambucca in front of the camera before downing it . Rory Anderson, news editor of the Leeds Student newspaper, who also says various sources have confirmed he is drinking alcohol, spoke to the man in the video. He told Mr Anderson: 'I’m worried all this attention is getting to my head.' Mr Anderson said the student has 'become something of a campus legend.' 'He has proven himself to be a huge hit with students across the country who have been impressed with both his drinking ability and the entertaining persona he adopts in the videos,' he said. He said that one fan 'even had 'MvB' tattooed on his backside whilst another wrote on YouTube that the unidentified student was 'more inspiring than my Dad'. Dangerous craze: Since he began posting the videos as 'Man Vs Booze' on YouTube just over a month ago,  his online following has grown each time he produced another 'episode' - each more risky than the last. In this video he downs a bottle of jäger and a large bottle of an energy drink poured into a bin . The student now has close to 10,000 followers on his Twitter page: @officialmvb and a similar number of fans on his official Facebook page. Worryingly, the series of videos, which has now hit 12, have been widely watched in Britain's universities and now a growing number of students across the country seem to want to match 'Man Vs. Booze' drinking. They have posted response videos of themselves downing massive amounts of alcohol in a bid to be 'Britain's biggest student drinker'. One of these, the 'Swansea Student Drinker', from Swansea University, has even posted a video reply in which he downs a pint of Jack Daniels and a pint of vodka in 30 seconds. Sparking a trend: Worryingly, the series of videos have been widely watched in Britain's universities and now a growing number of students across the country seem to want to match 'Man Vs. Booze' drinking 'achievements' Tweet: Leeds Student website reported that the 21-year-old decided things had to stop earlier this month and pretended he had been admitted to hospital for an alcohol related incident . The student explained why he pretended to get admitted to hospital in an email to Leeds Student. He write: 'When [Man Vs Booze] gained in popularity I realised that it was sending out the wrong message and too many people were trying to replicate it. This is when I decided to take action by fabricating the story that I had been admitted to hospital; to deter anyone else from trying to drink these irresponsible amounts of alcohol.' On his Twitter page, the student had written: 'This is MVBs housemate- he's just been taken to hospital after 2 pints of absinthe, please don't anyone try copy him, it's dangerous.' The videos have worrying health implications - under government guidelines men are advised not to drink more than four units in any one day - in one video the man consumes 18 units within one minute. Chris Sorek, Chief Executive of alcohol education charity Drinkaware, said: 'There’s nothing wrong with enjoying a few drinks on a night out but there are both short and long-term health and social harms that can come from overdoing it. 'Drinking to excess in a short period of time can cause an individual’s blood alcohol concentration to sky-rocket and can lead to nausea, confusion, loss of bladder and bowel control and ‘passing out’. 'In the most serious cases, alcohol poisoning can cause slowed breathing and result in a coma or even death. 'Socially, the digital world we live in means that people who have been drinking to excess can have their actions come back to haunt them online. What might appear fun when drunk can feel foolish and embarrassing in the cold light of day.' Leeds University Union Welfare Officer, Harriet Rankin, has told students she does not condone the behaviour and urged all students who have watched the video not to try anything similar. Leeds Student Union said they 'were aware' that the student media have covered the story, but they could not confirm or deny the man in the video was a student at the university.

"By . Emily Allen . PUBLISHED: . 05:28 EST, 19 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:09 EST, 19 June 2012 . While most people are content to cuddle up next to a cat or a dog, Katie Dunsmore only has eyes for her four woolly friends. But the model and actress is no farmer, her flock - Tilly, Rosemary, Ethel and Pearl - are strictly pets and she says she would never dream of using them for meat or anything else. Her four farmyard friends - who she calls 'my babies' - enjoy nothing more than following her about just like the character from the nursery rhyme and snacking on their favourite treats, jelly babies, from out of her hand. Friends: Shepherd Katie Dunsmore says she would never use Tilly, Rosemary, Ethel or Pearl for meat . She has even trained her beloved sheep to play football with her on the rolling fields near her home in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire. She said: 'My friends all think I’m crazy for having four pet sheep - I’m a girlie girl and I’m not really the kind of person you would expect to enjoy mucking out in the fields with a bunch of sheep but I love it. 'My dad calls me Little Bo Peep but I don’t mind. My sheep are my best friends and I wouldn’t trade them for the world.' Devoted Miss Dunsmore, 20, said the idea to buy the sheep earlier this year came about from a chat with her father Stuart, 65, a former farmer. Pampered: Miss Dunsmore has owned the four Texel sheep since January and has spent £1,800 on them . The pair, who until January had been living together happily in the town of Messingham with their just their two Persian housecats for company, decided something was missing from their lives. She said: 'He had been talking about how he worked on a farm when he was a little boy and loved hanging about the sheep and I suggested we should get some. 'When he agreed, I at first thought he was joking - I didn’t know the first thing about keeping sheep. But then we just thought it would be great to do something completely different. 'Everyone has cats and dogs and gerbils, but I don’t know anyone else who has four pet sheep. 'The more we talked about it the more I realised it would be a fun thing to do so we rented a piece of land and got four Texel cross sheep from a farmer in January.' Miss Dunsmore has since spent nearly £1,800 on the sheep, including £450 for a shed and £700 for the annual land fees. Baarmy: The four sheep have become quite tame and enjoy snaffling jelly babies out of Miss Dunsmore's hands . She said: 'At first we thought they were all female so I gave them all old lady names, but then I later found out they are actually all male. 'I kept the names because I thought they suited them, especially Pearl who has a big tuft of curly white hair on the top of her head like a little old lady.' Looking after the sheep is a lot of hard work so every day Miss Dunsmore can be found in the field, mucking them out and feeding them. Once the hard work is over however, she is then free to enjoy the company of her bleating babies. She said: 'They are a lot of work but they are more fun to look after than a guinea pig or a goldfish in a bowl. 'I love just sitting there and watching the world go by with my sheep. They are getting really tame now and will follow me all over the field. 'One day I brought a football with me for them to play with and now they love to have a little kickabout. 'They can get quite boisterous, especially when they know I have jelly babies on me and they come up and snaffle them out of my hand. 'Ethel is the brave one, she loves being stroked and will jump up if I have treats. Tilly was really timid to begin with but has really come out of her shell now. 'Rosemary is the rowdy one and will push the others out of the way to get to the food and Pearl, who is named after my nana, is the shy one. She prefers to be on her own.' Miss Dunsmore admits the sheep are number one in her life and even her boyfriend Michael Lewis, 36, is forced to get stuck in with the cleaning and care of her unusual pets. She said: 'I think people probably think I’m a bit mad when they first meet me and find out about my sheep and maybe I am. 'I put some photos of them on my Facebook and my friends couldn’t believe I’d gone out and bought four sheep to take care of but they are coming round to the idea now. 'I can’t imagine life without them, they are my babies.'","Tilly, Ethel, Rosemary and Pearl enjoy nothing more than following her around and snacking on their favourite treats - jelly babies ."
