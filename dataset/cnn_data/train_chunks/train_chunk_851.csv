"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Dale Bolinger, 57, is alleged to have told police he had fantasies about eating kindergarten staff at the age of six . A male nurse accused of arranging to meet a 14-year-old girl he planned to have sex with, behead and eat started having fantasies about cannibalism at the age of six, a court has heard. Dale Bolinger, 57, formerly of Canterbury, Kent, is said to have told police fantasied about taking kindergarten staff in to the kitchen and eating them when he was a child. Prosecutor Martin Yale told the court the male nurse made the confession when he was first arrested in February last year for attempting to sexually groom a girl under the age of 16. Bolinger is on trial at Canterbury Crown Court accused of arranging to meet with a girl, 14, that he met online on a site called the Dark Fetish Network (DFN). It is alleged he planned to meet up with the girl - known by her online profile name Eva Gonza - at Ashford International station before taking her to his home to have sex with her. He then planned to behead her with an axe and eat her, it is claimed. Reading Bolinger's police interview to the court, Mr Yale said: 'By the time I got to 14, I turned into the villain of the piece and I wondered what it would be like to eat a girl. Bolinger, who worked at the Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother Hospital in Margate, Kent,  also blamed his 'very domineering' mother for his behaviour which he described as 'weird' and 'very strange', the jury was told. He told police he had never discussed his fantasies with his wife Rosemary or his son Rick and said he felt ashamed, the court heard. He told police: 'It was less to do with sexual gratification and more to do with anger. 'The people that do it (cannibalism) are seriously deranged, and I may be many things but I am not deranged.' Prosector Mr Yale said Bolinger described his cannibalism fantasy as 'Jekyll and Hyde' but not something he could fulfil as he would never harm anyone. Bolinger said in interview: 'I think it was more to do with disliking my mother more than hating women.' He told police he had been brought up in a military household because his father was in the US Air Force and he had been suppressed as a child. Bolinger is said to have told police . that his mother had also made a drunken pass at him when he was 15, . which had left him 'shocked'. He said he had been emotionally absent from his son, the way his father had been with him, the court heard. Bolinger is said to have told police his cannibalism was 'less to do with sexual gratification and more to do with anger' during an police interview conducted when he was first arrested in February last year . He . told police he had had online chats with a girl he believed was 14 and . called Eva, who wished to be decapitated, the court heard. Bolinger . claimed he was so concerned by their conversation that he believed the . girl to be at risk, which is why he travelled to Ashford International . station in Kent to meet her, it is alleged. Mr Yale said Bolinger told police: 'At no time have I ever killed, kidnapped, taken or eaten a person.' The . court heard that Bolinger told the police he had bought the axe from . Homebase to remove two tree stumps from the side of his house. He admitted in interview that the discs found in his home which . contained indecent images of children were his, the jury heard. When . questioned about the images, Bolinger told police: 'I do not find . children sexually attractive but I do find them interesting as a food . source.' Paul Jarvis, . defending Bolinger, said: 'There is not a single piece of evidence from . the family home to say that anyone met their death there or has been . consumed at the property.' He asked Bolinger whether he had ever killed anybody, eaten human flesh or sexually assaulted a child. He said: 'Have you ever attempted to do any of those things?' 'I do not find . children sexually attractive but I do find them interesting as a food . source.' Bolinger in interview with police . Bolinger replied: 'No, not in reality, just in fantasy.' He . told the court he had previously been married for about 34 years and . that he and his wife had four children, including a boy called Martin . who had died before the age of one. Mr Jarvis asked him: 'When did your interest in the sorts of things we have been hearing about begin?' Bolinger said: 'Probably with puberty but before that it was me saving other children. 'When I first started school I had a fantasy about children being stolen and cooked and I would save them. That changed around puberty.' He also told the court he had found the DFN website through another website which contained cartoons of cannibalism. Bolinger told the court he had visited the DFN website out of curiosity and that the people he spoke to seemed to be 'willing to accept anything'. He said: 'I wanted to get them to the point where they said ""surely this is fantasy?""' He claimed he would say things to try to shock the people he was chatting to and that he did not believe that Eva was a 14-year-old girl. The male nurse is on trial accused of grooming an underage girl for sex. It is alleged he planned to meet up with a girl, 14, that he wanted to sleep with, behead and eat at Ashford International station, pictured . He told the jury: 'Initially, I was looking to find people with like minds and to see where they came from, but it soon spiralled down into trying to shock people enough that they would ask ""is this fantasy?""' Mr Jarvis asked Bolinger what he got out of the chat groups. Bolinger replied: 'I think it goes back to the feeling of power. When you have people trolling others I always think that they are trying to get some sort of power. 'They are trying to get a rise out of someone, and I am ashamed to say that is what I was trying to do.' Asked what sort of a buzz he got from the chats, he said: ""My buzz on it is non-terminal, biting, licking, that sort of thing. 'The idea of killing, eating someone, no.' He told the court he was there to work with people's fantasies but that he had taken it to the extreme. Mr Jarvis asked Bolinger whether he would ever decapitate someone in reality. Bolinger said: 'No, not only would you be killing somebody but the mess would be quiet incredible.' Mr Jarvis said: 'Why did you buy the axe?' 'At no time have I ever killed, kidnapped, taken or eaten a person.' Bolinger in police interview . Bolinger replied: 'Initially, I had been thinking about buying one, secondly they were on sale, and thirdly, she (Eva) said she would not come unless I bought one.' He told the court his concern for her safety was the only reason he had gone to meet her at Ashford International station and that he 'probably would have wet himself' if she had turned up, but that he would have called social services and the police. Bolinger was also asked about administering a poison or a noxious substance to his friend Urlene King after he put a cloth soaked in dry cleaning fluid over her mouth in July 2010 - a charge he pleaded guilty to in February this year. He told the court he had loved her and had sexual feelings for her and that he had made this known but Miss King had not really made her feelings towards him clear. He said they had been shopping, bought some fish and returned to his home. As he went to wash his hands he saw some gauze and the dry cleaning fluid and put it over her mouth. He said: 'I was intending to put it over her face. Why I was intending to put it over her face; I don't really remember it. 'I was watching myself from above. I was not aware; I could not feel any emotion or anything. 'Was I living out one of these fantasies? No. Was it to kill her? No. Was it to rape her? No. 'Why I was doing it I am not too sure. I cannot really give an adequate answer.' The trial was adjourned until 10am on Friday when Bolinger will be cross-examined by the prosecution.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A reformed burglar has been hailed a hero after saving the life of an elderly woman while on his window cleaning round. Jeff Rochford, who has 80 convictions on a criminal record that began at the age of eight, spotted June Hoyle, 78, through the window of her Stockton-on-Tees home as he set to work on her house. Seeing she looked unwell and that her face had dropped slightly on one side, the father-of-three realised she was showing symptoms of a stroke and dialled 999 on his mobile phone. Reformed burglar Jeff Rochford is being hailed a hero after he called emergency services after noticing June Hoyle was suffering from a stroke . His quick-thinking may have saved Mrs Hoyle's life as doctors later confirmed she had been having a stroke. Mr Rochford said of the incident on Monday: 'I'm really glad that she's doing well in hospital and getting the care she needs. Mr Rochford is now studying to be a mentor and hopes to help other criminals turn their lives around . 'She wasn't her usual lively self and then I saw her face had dropped a bit I was concerned so I called for an ambulance. I waited until they arrived and then her son came round that night to tell me she had had a stroke and thank me.' The 36-year-old is determined to put his criminal past behind him. Mr Rochford said: 'I don't make any secret about my past, I was a prolific offender and I have been in prison. But that's my past now and I will never go back to it. 'It was an awful life to lead, my life was totally chaotic and at times it seemed as though there was no way out of it for me.' And he wants to help other do the same, and has passed level one and two of a diploma in peer mentoring. 'I want to get into offender management and work with offenders to help them turn their lives around.' Mrs Hoyle remains in hospital having treatment but is said to be 'doing well'. Her son Dennis said: 'He saved my mum's life. I don't care about his past, what he did was fantastic and the whole family is grateful to him. 'Everyone knows the longer you leave a stroke the worse it gets. Jeff's actions made sure mum got to hospital quickly. God knows how long it would have been if he had not been there.'","Jeff Rochford, who has 80 convictions, is being hailed as a hero .

"By . Katy Winter . They are rather new to the game, but the parenting styles of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are already attracting attention. William and Kate first broke with royal tradition by not hiring a full time nanny to help with child care, then William chose to drive his son home from the hospital rather than rely on a family chauffeur, and now in his first interview since the birth of George Prince William has admitted he wants to be a hands on father. William's admission indicates that he may already be favouring 'terrier' tactics, one of three behavioural types identified by new reseach. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge look to be planning to be hands on parents to baby Prince George . Will William be a 'terrier' dad- closely involved with his son and joining in his games and activities? Childcare expert, Denise Robertson, reveals there are three main types of parent, which can each be represented by an animal; terrier, lion and penguin. ‘Terrier’ parents, which Wills and Kate seem to be lining up to be, want to be highly involved in their child’s life. A quarter of parents polled in the research (24 per cent) want to squeeze in as much time with their children as they can and try to get involved as much as possible. Terrier fathers  are seen as big kids with 30 per cent of terriers getting involved with everything their child does and 26 per cent take up a hobby just because their child likes it. William may try and recreate his happy early childhood within the walls of  the royal palaces with his son, as almost a third of fathers (30 per cent) report playing the same games as they did as a child because they want their child to have the same upbringing. For some mothers and fathers getting involved in their child’s life is as much because they want to keep them entertained as for the benefits of hands on parenting – almost half of parents (45 per cent) worry their child will be bored during the holidays. William (seen here with Diana and Harry) may try and recreate his happy early childhood with his son, as almost a third of fathers report playing the same games as they did as a child . ‘Lion’ parents however, take a very different approach to raising their children. Much like the lion, these parents believe independence is key and that sometimes kids just need time with their own imagination. One in ten parents polled agree and take a hands off approach to childcare, leaving the kids to their own devices with 41 per cent admitting that looking after the children can be tiring so by giving them some time to play on their own not only gives busy parents time to rest, but also helps them improve their creativity. The third parenting type identified by the research by Capri Sun and Denise is 'Penguin' parenting, where parents share responsibilities to look after the children. Childcare can often be a bit of a balancing act for busy working parents and 34 per cent say they struggle to get time off work, while over a fifth (21 per cent) say finding childcare is difficult. Spending time with your kids is . important for all parents so when it comes to looking after their . children, Penguin parents want someone close to home to look after the . little ones. A quarter rely on family and friends and topping the list is grandparents (57 per cent) and neighbours (11 per cent). 'Lion' parents allow their children a lot of independence (left) while 'penguin' parents share parenting duties with others - often extended to family members such as grandparents (right) While it may be tempting to try and fit yourself into the mould of one these three animal definitions of parenting, founder of mumsnet Justine Roberts warns that it isn’t necessarily helpful. ‘Mothers are, sadly, used to being criticised for their parenting techniques whatever they do, whether it's being a stay-at-home-mum, working mum, getting involved or being hands-off. ‘It seems that Terrier, Lion and Penguin parenting are new labels to replace Tiger Mums, helicopter parents and the rest. ‘Parents broadly share only a couple of common characteristics - that they're doing their best and are knackered most of the time,’ Jane says.","Parenting experts have identified three parenting styles .
'Terrier' parents want to be very involved in all aspects of their child's life .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Rebecca Coales takes a well-deserved breather – after swimming nearly four lengths of an Olympic-size pool without coming up for air. The 38-year-old held her breath for more than two and a half minutes as she swam an incredible 587ft underwater. Her feat earned her a UK record for freediving, which can involve competitors with no breathing apparatus swimming as far as they can without surfacing. Making waves: Rebecca Coales, 38, takes a well-deserved breath after she broke the British record for freediving in Stockport, Greater Manchester . Miss Coales, who carried out her dive in Stockport, Greater Manchester, beat the previous record by 13ft. Her specific discipline is called Dynamic With Fins, and she propels herself through the water with a giant flipper resembling a mermaid’s tail. The swimmer, who trains for 12 hours a week, said: ‘I am so pleased I have done it. It’s my first monofin record. ‘My sights are now on the world championships where I will compete in no fins, monofins and static dives (a type of freediving in which the competitor stays in one place). ‘I look forward to achieving even more in the sport.’ Technique: The swimmer swam nearly four lengths of an Olympic-sized pool without surfacing and propelled herself in the water using one giant fin . Poolside: Miss Coales (centre) with (from left to right) cameraman Paul Butterworth, judge Gary Lowe, coach Steve Millard and manager Kirsty Hockley . The record was observed by her coach Steve Millard and international judge Gary Lowe. Mr Millard said she had made fast progress, adding: ‘Rebecca is a relative newcomer to the competition circuit, only starting to explore her potential in the last 18 months.’ Miss Coales is a member of freediving club Apneists UK, which trains across the North West. Kirsty Hockley, general manager at the Life Leisure swimming pool in Stockport, said she was thrilled that it had been chosen for the record attempt. The world Dynamic With Fins record is 767ft, and was set by Natalia Molchanova from Russia in June last year. Build-up: Before the record-breaking swim, she prepared by lying at the side of the pool listening to music .","Rebecca Coales, 38, swam nearly four lengths of an Olympic-size pool .

"By . Jack Doyle . Charles Clarke has poured cold water on Ed Miliband's chances at the next election - saying he has failed to show how he will control spending . Ed Miliband is a worse Labour leader than Neil Kinnock and will lose next year’s General Election, a former Labour Home Secretary warned last night. Charles Clarke, a senior Cabinet minister under Tony Blair, said the party had spent too much money while in office – and Mr Miliband had failed to show how he would control spending if elected. Mr Clarke said the Labour leader had ‘no narrative’ and had set out an ‘assembly of odd policies’ which were failing to appeal to voters. And he said Labour would be doing better in the polls if Ed Balls was replaced by Alistair Darling.  The Tories seized on the comments, saying they showed Labour would ‘send us straight back into economic meltdown.’ Mr Clarke, a leading Blairite minister, entered academia after losing his Norwich South seat in 2010 to the Liberal Democrats. His comments are the latest blow to Mr Miliband, who has seen his abysmal personal poll ratings slide in recent months, amid a string of PR disasters. The negative comparison with Lord Kinnock is particularly toxic – as the Welsh former Labour leader lost two consecutive elections in 1987 and 1992. In an interview with the Huffington Post, Mr Clarke said of Lord Kinnock: ‘Neil has far, far more qualities than Ed Miliband as a leader. Neil was a fantastic leader and brought Labour back towards victory.’ Mr Clarke said the ‘most likely outcome’ of next year’s election was a victory for David Cameron’s Conservatives. And, asked whether Labour could convince voters of its economic credibility in time for the May 7 poll, he replied: ‘I don’t completely exclude it but I think it’s unlikely.’ Asked if Mr Miliband passes the test with voters that they could imagine him at 10 Downing Street, he said: ‘He does actually. I think he has a problem with the population, undoubtedly.. he is an intelligent man, he’d be a good prime minister. I don’t myself think he’s geeky.’ Mr Clarke served in Tony Blair’s government from 1998 to 2006 but resigned as Home Secretary following the foreign prisoners scandal. He said that Labour under Mr Miliband was ‘not remotely near’ providing the necessary narrative of where it felt it succeeded or failed in Government. Mr Clarke said Mr Miliband needed to set out a clear statement of what Labour would actually do in power . He said that critics were right to say Labour spent too much while in power, accusing Gordon Brown of overspending ‘not very, very dramatically but significantly’ between 2006 and 2008. He said Mr Miliband now needs to ‘set out a clear statement of what Labour would actually do - give people a reason to vote Labour, not an assembly of odd policies like the electricity (price) freeze or whatever’. Mr Clarke said Tony Blair’s money-making activities since leaving Government had ‘damaged his reputation’. But he claimed Mr Blair would have ‘every chance’ of being chosen leader and elected prime minister if he was still a Labour MP. Asked whether former chancellor Alistair Darling would do a better job than Mr Balls as shadow chancellor, Mr Clarke stressed he was ‘not calling for Ed Balls to go. But he added: ‘I don’t think Alistair wants to do it [but] definitely I think it would be better for Labour if Alistair was there rather than Ed Balls.’ A poll last month found that 51 per cent think Mr Miliband is a weak leader, 56 per cent think he is out of touch with ordinary people, and 60 per cent think he would not be up to the job of leading the country. Two weeks ago, former London mayor Ken Livingstone said Mr Miliband was ‘like me’, adding: ‘People have always thought I’m weird.’ Tory MP Nigel Adams said: ‘Charles Clarke admits what Ed Balls can’t: under Labour spending ran out of control, leaving us with the biggest deficit in our peacetime history. ‘Just like then, Labour are incapable of taking the difficult decisions required to secure a better future for Britain. ‘Nothing’s changed. Labour’s plans for more spending, more borrowing and more taxes would send us straight back into economic meltdown.’","Former Labour Home Secretary says party spent too much money in office and Ed Miliband had failed to show how he would control spending if elected .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . It is claimed images taken by spy planes may provide clues to what happened to missing girl Madeleine McCann, disappeared in Portugal in 2007 . Madeleine McCann's abductor may have been caught on camera by a spy plane on a training exercise for Nato, it was claimed today. Military expert Philip Burden said highly-detailed aerial pictures were taken of the Portuguese coastline on the day the child went missing six-and-a-half years ago. Mr Burden, a former Ministry of Defence employee, claimed the Portuguese Air Force then passed on the film to Portuguese police investigating Madeleine's disappearance. It is believed the spy cameras used are so detailed they can pick out the registration number on a car if a good image is taken. If . high quality images are available, detectives could use them to piece . together what happened on the day Madeleine disappeared, he said. Mr Burden told The Sunday Express: 'The aircraft may provide a new lead in the hunt for Madeleine. 'During the early and late evening of May 3, 2007, the day Madeleine . disappeared from the holiday resort of Praia da Luz, the plane took . aerial photos of that stretch of the Algarve.' Mr . Burden added: 'I'm told there were a number of low-level passes over . the resort as part of a lengthy photo reconnaissance training mission. Although the light was fading, people and buildings could be clearly . seen.' The Portuguese . shelved their inquiry into her disappearance in 2008, but in October . said that a review had uncovered enough new information to justify . reopening the case. British . police received hundreds of calls and emails after renewed . television appeals for information in the UK, Holland and Germany. They appealed for help trying to trace a . man who was seen carrying a child towards the sea, and a number of fair- . haired men who were lurking around the holiday apartments where . Madeleine was staying. The Ocean Club Resort in Praia Da Luz where the McCann family were staying when Madeleine went missing . Last month, it emerged police were planning to reinterview several employees at the Ocean Club, the hotel where the McCann family were staying. More than 130 workers were questioned during the initial inquiry, including two men who fixed a blind in the McCanns’ apartment two days before Madeleine disappeared.

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . A Jaguar advert featuring Hollywood actor Tom Hiddleston has been banned for promoting speeding and unsafe driving. The video was published on Jaguar Land Rover’s YouTube channel and was titled The Art Of Villainy. It showed the actor - perhaps best known for his role of Loki in several Marvel Studios films - playing a villain while driving a Jaguar F-Type in an underground car park and through central London. Scroll down for video . A Jaguar advert that featured Hollywood star Tom Hiddleston, pictured, has been banned by a watchdog for promoting speeding and unsafe driving . The advert - which was called The Art of Villainy - showed the actor driving an F-Type Jaguar in an underground car park and through the streets of central London . The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) received a complaint that the advert was socially irresponsible because it featured and encouraged unsafe driving. An investigation was launched and, despite the car maker claiming the car barely moved in the advert, it was banned by the watchdog. Last month the ASA banned a set of . four video adverts on Jaguar’s website showing a car travelling at speed . through a tunnel and crossing over the single white lines in the middle . of a road, before driving across a mountain road at night. It said the overall impression of the adverts was a focus on the speed and . acceleration of the cars. It added that the cars were being driven on . what appeared to be public roads and in a manner that would be . 'irresponsible and illegal' in the UK. On hearing about the latest complaint, Jaguar Land Rover said the advert was . set almost entirely in an underground car park and that during this time . the car barely moved. Another still from the advert shows the actor accelerating along Embankment. The Advertising Standards Authority said this scene 'encouraged irresponsible driving' Another scene from the advert showing two stationary cars outside a building. Last month, four other Jaguar adverts were banned by the ASA - also for promoting speeding and unsafe driving . The . car maker added when the car leaves the car park towards the end of the . footage, it was shown to be travelling at normal road speeds. The company claimed that, although the vehicle accelerated briefly along The Embankment, the speed limit was not exceeded. In its ruling, the ASA said that - although the car's appearance was the main focus of the film - acceleration and speed did feature in the footage. It said: 'Whilst we acknowledge the sequences were brief, we considered that the second part of the ad suggested that the car was being driven at excessive speeds and that the ad therefore encouraged irresponsible driving.' It ruled that the advert must not appear again in its current form, adding: 'We told Jaguar Land Rover not to portray speed or driving behaviour that might encourage motorists to drive irresponsibly in future.' Last month a series of four Jaguar adverts were banned - including this one showing who cars travelling down a dust road - for promoting unsafe driving .","Jaguar released latest advert The Art Of Villainy on its YouTube channel .

"By . Daniel Martin . and Ray Massey . Death toll: Conservative Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said too many people were dying on the roads because of mobile phones . The penalty for drivers who use a mobile phone at the wheel could be doubled to six points. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said yesterday that the high death toll from accidents caused by motorists texting or making calls had prompted him to consider a fresh crackdown. ‘The amount of casualties has been absolutely appalling,’ he said. ‘We’ve got to change this. We’ve got to get that message across.’ Foolish use of mobiles destroys lives, he said, with the latest figures showing phones contribute to one road death every fortnight. The new rules, being considered by his officials, would mean a driver could be banned after two mobile offences over three years. A newly-qualified driver could be banned after one offence because their threshold for a ban is six points. The increased penalty would also dramatically affect a driver’s insurance premiums. In addition, the department is looking at raising fines from £100 to £150. Mr McLoughlin said he was so taken with the idea – floated by Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe – that he asked civil servants to work up potential legislation. A change in the law is not likely until after the next election. It follows research showing texting at the wheel can be more distracting than the effects of drink or drugs. The Transport Research Laboratory found sending a text slows reaction time by 37 per cent. Using cannabis delayed it 21 per cent, and drinking to the legal limit 13 per cent. Speaking on a phone slowed it by 46 per cent. At a Westminster lunch, Mr McLoughlin said ‘sometimes people do silly things they don’t realise the consequences of’, adding: ‘I’m particularly referring to the use of mobile phones when driving. ‘The person who is using their phone doesn’t realise the damage or the danger that they could be in, so it ends up ruining different people’s lives.’ In 2011, driving while using a mobile was recorded as a contributory factor in 23 fatalities and 74 serious injuries, he said. Danger: In 2011, driving while using a mobile phone was recorded as a contributing factor in 23 deaths, nearly one every fortnight (file picture) Although road deaths are falling, Mr McLoughlin said ‘one death is too many’. ‘Bernard Hogan-Howe has called for six penalty points for the use of a mobile phone. It’s an interesting suggestion. It’s one that I would want to look at.’ Using a mobile at the wheel has been illegal for a decade, with the fine initially £30. In 2007, it was increased to three points and £60, and last year it rose to £100, and a possible £1,000 on conviction in court. Between May 2012 and August 2013, the number of drivers with points on their licence for using a mobile phone fell by 14 per cent, from 677,500 to 583,700. Last year, Sir Bernard said: ‘If I was able tomorrow, I would say you get six points for driving while using a phone. The problem at the moment is we are dishing out lots of tickets, somebody gets three points and they have got another three chances.’ Stricter punishments: Met police commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe believes people caught using mobile phones at the wheel twice should be banned from the road . Yesterday, Mr McLoughlin said: ‘I just want to look at it. I also want to alert people to what they are doing – that it is a foolish thing to do.’ He said one difficulty is that drivers who have passed in the previous two years lose their licence if they get six points – compared to 12 for other drivers. This means a new driver could be banned for one offence. A Department for Transport source said one way to prevent this was to give three points for a first offence, six for a second. Ministers recently increased fixed penalties for a range of offences by 66 per cent – from £60 to £100. Offences upgraded include using a handheld mobile phone to speak or text, speeding, running a red light and failing to wear a seatbelt while driving. All bar the last also carry three points. Motoring groups and MP watchdogs broadly welcomed the points move but said more enforcement is needed. Louise Ellman, head of the Commons transport select committee, said: ‘I think he is right to raise this serious road safety issue.’ Professor Stephen Glaister, of the RAC Foundation, said official figures show the number of infractions may fall as new laws are introduced, only to rise again later on. He said: ‘The issue is less the size of the penalty and more the level of enforcement . . . The message seems clear: drivers believe they won’t be caught.’ The latest RAC Report on Motoring said 51 per cent of motorists think they will escape prosecution for texting in traffic as they see others ‘getting away with it’. There are not enough police patrols, it said. AA president Edmund King said: ‘Harsher penalties such as six points and bigger fines are only part of the solution. They won’t be effective unless accompanied by more cops in cars to enforce the law.’","Patrick McLoughlin  considering doubling  penalty points for the offence .

"By . Jason Groves, Deputy Political Editor . New role: Downing Street yesterday confirmed that Philip Hammond will replace William Hague at the Foreign Office . David Cameron risked moving Britain closer to the EU exit door last night – by appointing a man dubbed ‘the most Eurosceptic Foreign Secretary since Viscount Halifax declared war in 1939’. Downing Street yesterday confirmed that Philip Hammond will replace William Hague at the Foreign Office following the latter’s dramatic decision to step down on Monday night. Mr Hammond, 58, is one of the few senior Tories to publicly state he would vote to leave the European Union unless it reforms. Other prominent Eurosceptics receiving promotions included Mr Hammond’s  successor as Defence Secretary, Michael Fallon, and new Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss. The appointment of Mr Hammond, who is close to Home Secretary Theresa May, will also make him a major player in the eventual contest to replace Mr Cameron as Tory leader. But the main focus yesterday was on what the appointment signals about Mr Cameron’s approach to negotiations with Brussels ahead of a promised in/out referendum on Europe in 2017. Mats Persson, director of the respected Open Europe think-tank, said the Cabinet had ‘clearly taken a more Eurosceptic turn’, adding that Mr Hammond ‘undoubtedly has a higher threshold than William Hague’ for what would be a good deal for Britain. Mr Persson said: ‘Having a figure who has said that reform must be substantial for him to back an “in” will add credibility to their election campaign and help win back voters who have left to vote for Ukip. ‘It’s fair to say Mr Hammond is the most Eurosceptic Tory Foreign Secretary since Viscount Halifax declared war in 1939.’ Former Tory minister Tim Loughton welcomed the appointment: ‘He’s clearly much more of an overt Eurosceptic and the whole story post-the-2015-election is going to be about renegotiation with Europe ahead  of a referendum. Same policy: William Hague rejected the theory that naming Mr Hammond as his successor marked a more Eurosceptic approach from the Tories . ‘William . has done a fantastic job, one of the best Foreign Secretaries, but has . not been as outspoken on Euroscepticism as many perhaps would like him . to be.’ But Mr Hague rejected the theory that naming Mr Hammond as his successor marked a more Eurosceptic approach from the Tories. He said: ‘We are very clear and united on Europe. Philip Hammond, David Cameron and I all have exactly the same policy on Europe. ‘We want to improve Britain’s relationship with the EU and then hold a referendum on staying in or leaving the European Union.’ Last year Mr Hammond said he would vote to leave the EU ‘if the choice is between a European Union written exactly as it is today and not being a part of that’. But yesterday he attempted to play down his doubts about Brussels, saying he believes Britain can achieve an acceptable deal from the EU. Mr Hammond said: ‘I’m going to focus on making sure that we get a successful renegotiation with our European partners. I don’t think the way to enter a negotiation is to start issuing threats. The way to enter a negotiation is to look for the areas where we do agree. ‘There are many issues where Britain is not isolated, where there are other members of the European Union that also understand the need for reform and particularly understand the need for reform to allow the Eurozone and the non-Eurozone part of Europe to be able to work together. ‘I believe it will be possible to renegotiate significant change to the way the European Union works.’ Mr Hammond is seen by the Prime Minister as a safe pair of hands and was instrumental in tackling the disastrous finances of the Ministry of Defence. But his cheese-paring approach was unpopular with some members of the military top brass. Mr Hammond will be plunged immediately into a series of international crises, including the bloody civil wars in Iraq and Syria, the renewed fighting in Israel and  the continuing Russian threats against Ukraine.","Philip Hammond will replace William Hague as Foreign Secretary .

"By . James Chapman . Out: Michael Gove paid the price for his 'toxic' public image which was blamed for turning voters against his school reforms . Michael Gove was demoted yesterday as David Cameron’s election guru Lynton Crosby engineered a ruthless elevation of women and Eurosceptics. The Education Secretary, a hero for the Tory Right, paid the price for his ‘toxic’ public image which was blamed for turning voters against his school reforms. To the alarm of education reformers, he was shifted to become chief whip – a position hailed as ‘one of the most important jobs’ in government by David Cameron, but one which will mean a substantial pay cut and an end to his full Cabinet status. Mr Gove’s former aide, Dominic Cummings, accused the Prime Minister of ‘surrender’. The populist hand of Mr Crosby, the Tories’ Australian chief election strategist, was detected across yesterday’s reshuffle. Designed to turn the Tory top team into an ‘election-winning machine’, it was by far the most extensive shake-up Mr Cameron has carried out in his nine years as party leader. A succession of telegenic women – including two working mothers, Elizabeth Truss and Nicky Morgan – won big promotions. At 38, Miss Truss, tipped as a potential future party leader, became the youngest woman Cabinet minister ever, while Mrs Morgan will replace Mr Gove as Education Secretary. Philip Hammond, appointed as Foreign Secretary after William Hague stood down to become leader of the Commons, was hailed as the most Eurosceptic holder of the post since the Second World War. Opponents of Tory plans to reform European human rights laws, including Attorney General Dominic Grieve, were swept away. In all, 11 male ministers, most of them middle-aged, jumped before they were pushed or were sacked by Mr Cameron. His most difficult exchange is understood to have been with outgoing Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, whose dismissal infuriated some on the Right of the party. The biggest shock was the move out of education for Mr Gove, one of the Prime Minister’s oldest friends and allies. Just weeks ago, Mr Cameron appeared to guarantee him his job during exchanges at Prime Minister’s Questions. Mr Gove, the architect of the Government’s . new free schools, funded by the state but unshackled from council . control, told allies just days ago that he was going nowhere. Shake-up: Lynton Crosby (left), David Cameron's election guru, designed the reshuffle to make the top Tory team an 'election-winning machine'. It's by far the biggest shake-up in the Prime Minister's nine years as leader . But senior figures in Downing Street, including chief of staff Ed Llewellyn, are understood to have been increasingly exasperated by Mr Gove’s public battles with colleagues. In recent months, he has clashed with education minister David Laws and Home Secretary Theresa May, and has maintained a constant state of warfare with an education establishment he branded ‘The Blob’. Mr Crosby is thought to have pointed to polling evidence suggesting Mr Gove’s unpopularity had spread beyond teachers and was contaminating the Government’s education message more widely. One recent YouGov poll showed voters now oppose schools becoming academies by 41 per cent to 31 per cent and Mr Gove’s flagship free schools project by 53 per cent to 23 per cent. Other polling evidence showed the Education Secretary had become one of the most recognisable members of the Government – equal only to Mr Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne – but by far its most unpopular senior minister. Within the past few days Mr Cameron is understood to have spoken to Mr Gove to suggest a move to replace Sir George Young, the outgoing chief whip, who is in charge of party discipline. Traditionally, the role is conducted out of public view, but the Prime Minister sought to sweeten the pill by promising Mr Gove he would be one of his main election advisers and would appear regularly in the media. Former Tory whip Sir Greg Knight said: ‘If the spin is true and we have a chief whip who regularly addresses the nation, I think this will prove a mistake.’ There were claims – hotly disputed by the Treasury – that George Osborne initially opposed the idea of a move for the Education Secretary, who has emerged as the unofficial head of the Chancellor’s campaign to succeed Mr Cameron. Britain's teachers wasted no time in gloating over Michael Gove’s demotion yesterday, going online to share expletive-filled insults and pictures of voodoo dolls to send the Education Secretary on his way. Within hours of the shock announcement, #GoveGone was trending on Twitter amid reports of teachers cheering, ‘weeping with joy’ and high-fiving each other in the corridors of schools around the country. One staff room reportedly even brought out ‘the posh biscuits’ to celebrate. A knitted doll of Mr Gove, stuck with pins, was tweeted by @HPUKStudents, with the message: ‘Nicky Morgan replaces Gove as education secretary. Probably won’t need this any more then.’ Opponents were also encouraged to attack him on Twitter via an online game called ‘Slap Michael Gove’, which saw him being struck hundreds of thousands of times yesterday. There were also mocked-up photos of Mr Gove receiving an ‘F’ in his exam results and being ‘sent to the naughty step’, while he was even likened to a sexually transmitted disease. Trade unionists could not contain their glee as they claimed the NUT strike last week, which caused disruption to thousands of parents and pupils, had successfully ousted Mr Gove. An NUT poster was circulated online, stating: ‘Your pressure has had an impact. Government policy must now urgently change.’ Glee: The NUT poster that was shared online (left) and a mobile phone game which allows you to 'slap Gove' Asked if the change of job represented a ‘punishment’, Mr Cameron insisted: ‘I can tell you, if you are Prime Minister, the chief whip is one of the most important jobs in government. I wanted one of my big hitters, one of my real stars, one of my great brains, someone who has done extraordinary things for education in this country, to do that job, to deliver the Government’s programme, to help secure the future for our country.’ He said he was proud to lead ‘a fresh team with the ideas, the energy and the ability to take this country forward’. Aides . insisted Mrs Morgan was ‘100 per cent’ behind Mr Gove’s reforms. Mr Gove . insisted the Prime Minister had given him the choice of taking charge . of the whips’ office or staying where he was. He appeared unaware that . the move will mean taking a pay cut – from £141,647 to £103,937. He . admitted: ‘It’s naturally a wrench to be moved from a job I love … . Demotion, emotion, locomotion, whatever I’m engaged in today, I’m . pushing forward the Government’s agenda.’ There was dismay on the Right of the Conservative Party at his move. Senior MPs questioned why Miss Truss, who was Mr Gove’s deputy as schools minister, had not been promoted to take the job if there was no desire to signal a break with his agenda. There were indications on unhappiness in the party at the scale of Mr Cameron’s purge. Centrists were dismayed at the departure of pro-European veteran Kenneth Clarke, Mr Grieve, who had defended the European court of human rights, and climate change minister Greg Barker. Former Tory MP Louise Mensch claimed the ‘desire for publicity’ of Mr Gove’s former aide Mr Cummings, who has been scathing about Mr Cameron and his senior officials, had ‘got the best education secretary we’ve ever had sacked’. Mr Cummings dismissed that accusation and suggested instead it was a surprise that Mr Gove had lasted so long. He added: ‘We got away with subverting every Whitehall and Number Ten process, and it took David Cameron four years to surrender. We assumed he would in 2012 and 2013.’","Gove paid the price for his public image which turned voters against him .

"By . Kate Ferguson . Cyclist Brian Robinson - the first Briton to finish the Tour de France - has been admitted to hospital after a collision with a car while on his bike. The veteran road racer, 83, was cycling with friends when he was hit by a car just three miles from his home in West Yorkshire. Emergency services were called to Lees Hall Road in Thornhill Lees at around 1.20pm and rushed Robinson to hospital where he was being kept in overnight and being treated for a suspected broken collar bone and cuts and bruises. Landmark achievement: Brian Robinson was the first Briton to complete the Tour de France . The pioneering cyclist's son-in-law Martyn Bolt, a Conservative councillor for Mirfield in West Yorkshire, said the family was 'shaken up' by the crash. He said: 'He was descending a road when the collision happened. He has suffered multiple bruises and lacerations and what looks like a broken collar bone. Skin and blood came off. 'Your leg is one of the places that is hurt when you are hit and bounce across the road, but unlike many cyclists on the Tour de France, he hasn't got as much padding as some of the younger ones. 'We don't know how long he will be in hospital for, but we are hoping he will be back on his bike before too long. He likes to go out twice a week to keep fit and spend time with his friend.

"Departing Brazil technical director Carlos Alberto Parreira has warned the country's football federation (CBF) against appointing a foreign coach. Luiz Felipe Scolari stood down as the Selecao's coach after their World Cup dream fell apart in a 7-1 semi-final hammering by Germany, followed by another defeat to Holland in the third place play-off. His backroom staff left with him and attention will now turn to finding a successor, with suggestions a first ever overseas appointment could be on the agenda. Note of caution: Outgoing Brazilian Football Federation technical director Carlos Alberto Parreira believes Luis Felipe Scolari's successor should not come from outside the country . Gone: Luis Felipe Scolari stepped down as Brazil coach following their humiliation at the World Cup . But Parreira, like Scolari a former World Cup-winning Brazil coach having led them in 1994, wants to see another home-grown coach. 'Great teams have to have a local coach,' Parreira told ESPN Brasil. 'If somebody from another country takes the job, he is going to suffer a lot. And when he starts to get it, it will be too late. 'I'm not against the idea but I think it will be difficult for a foreign coach to implement his ideas. In six matches, if he loses three, people are going to criticise him. 'I think there are competent people here who can do the job.' Humbled: Brazil were thrashed 7-1 by eventual winners Germany in the semi-final, one of the worst results in the country's proud footballing history . Bad to worse: Brazil were then beaten 3-0 by Holland in the third-place play-off, with defender Daley Blind one of those on target . Sao Paulo's Muricy Ramalho and former Corinthians coach Tite are among the Brazilian coaches linked with the vacancy. Manchester City's Manuel Pellegrini, from Chile, is reported to have rejected advances from the CBF but Parreira pointed to England and their experience with high-profile coaches from abroad as a cautionary tale. 'Sven-Goran Eriksson was a failure and Fabio Capello was an even bigger failure,' he said. Even a semi-final place was arguably a good achievement for a below-par Brazil squad and Parreira admits much work is needed to find the next generation of players.

"By . Ian Drury . Lawyers, accountants and financial advisers who turn a blind eye to organised crime will face five years in jail under new laws to be unveiled in the Queen’s Speech. Hundreds of white-collar professionals who help the most dangerous gangsters evade the law but are not directly involved in crimes will be targeted by police. They help gangs set up their illegal businesses by writing contracts, arranging property purchases, offering advice or sending funds overseas. Facing the threat of jail: Hundreds of white-collar professionals who help the most dangerous gangsters evade the law but are not directly involved in crimes will be targeted by police . The crackdown will also tackle ‘Mr Bigs’, such as the Adams family crime syndicate, who often plan and co-ordinate crimes but avoid prosecution because they do not ‘get their hands dirty’. The wide-ranging overhaul of the law will be laid out in a Serious Crime Bill in the Queen’s Speech. Similar to America’s anti-mafia laws, the legislation is part of a concerted drive by ministers to land a blow on Britain’s £24billion-a-year organised crime industry. The Home Office is determined to focus on the corrupt professionals behind the underworld gangs who bring terror to the streets of Britain. The so-called ‘crooks in suits’ help crime bosses set up their illegal businesses by writing contracts, arranging property purchases, offering advice or sending funds overseas. But they avoid ending up behind bars by adopting a ‘no questions asked’ approach and then claiming in court they had no idea that they were involved in a crime networks. Now a new offence of participation in an organised crime group – which includes everything from credit card fraud to cigarette smuggling – will allow police and prosecutors to take action against these individuals. The authorities will only have to prove there were ‘reasonable grounds’ to suspect an individual knew they were helping carry out wrong-doing. The measures will also target others who help gangs commit crimes by, for instance, renting warehouse space, hiring vehicles or delivering packages. Those convicted under the new offence would face up to five years behind bars. Ministers believe up to 200 people, including professionals such as lawyers and accountants, will go to prison under the laws each year. 'Nobody is above the law': Tory Home Office minister Karen Bradley said the new offence sends out a clear message to professionals helping criminals . The move follows rising concern about crime lords such as David Hunt, an East End businessman known as ‘Long Fella’ whose gang a judge said was involved in fraud, money-laundering and extreme violence, and the Adams family, whose members have been linked to at least 25 murders worldwide, as well as drug trafficking, extortion and hijacking. Home Office minister Karen Bradley said: ‘Nobody is above the law. But for too long corrupt lawyers, accountants and other professionals have tried to evade justice by hiding behind a veneer of respectability. ‘This new offence sends out a clear message to those individuals - if you are helping to oil the wheels of organised crime, you will be prosecuted and face being jailed.’ Ministers will also beef up powers to prevent ‘Mr Bigs’ holding onto their multi-million pound gains because of flaws in the enforcement system. The aim is to close loopholes which enable criminals to get round confiscation orders and tackle those who avoid paying. The shake-up will bolster prosecutors’ ability to freeze assets and introduce prison sentences for offenders who hold onto their illegal profits. The proposed legislation comes in the wake of a highly critical report by the National Audit Office which warned only 26p in every £100 generated by criminal activity was recovered by the authorities. Under the changes, criminals who ignore court orders to repay over £10million of illicit gains will lose their right to early release from prison. Organised crime bosses will be barred from using ‘designer divorces’ to conceal their illegal profits. Assets will be allowed to be frozen earlier in investigations and the maximum time to pay confiscation orders will be increased from six to 12 months. Some £1.48billion is currently outstanding in unpaid confiscation orders. One of the worst examples of criminal defiance is convicted fraudster Gerald Smith who still owes taxpayers £57.2million. Smith, who was jailed in 2006 and is now free, made his illicit fortune from a dotcom swindle and used the money to buy a £3million house overlooking Wentworth golf course, another home in Jersey, a yacht and an art collection. The oldest outstanding confiscation order is for £300,000 and dates back to 1988.","Lawyers and accountants who help gangs will be targeted by new law .

"By . Luke Kirchner . Ben Davies is the young Swansea defender being chased by Liverpool and Tottenham. Reds boss Brendan Rodgers has had an £8million bid rejected with the Swans holding out for £12m. Sportsmail takes a closer peek at the player whose career path is very much on the up. Who is he and what position does he play? Davies was born on the April 24, 1993 and is a Welsh left back who came through Swansea City’s youth system to become a regular first-team starter. Exciting prospect: Ben Davies has already played 84 times for Swansea despite only turning 21 in April . No nonsense: Davies is a tough tackler as well as providing an attacking threat from left back . What’s all the fuss about, then? Davies, 21, is best known amongst the Swansea fans for his consistency. They could count the mistakes he’s made on one hand and, in playing 43 games for them last season, he showed no signs of burnout. He is calm and composed on the ball and a threat going forward. So he’s another Luke Shaw? He’s very similar. Davies, like Shaw, came through the ranks at his first club to become a regular starter and has international experience with Wales as well. Davies is an attacking full back, too, but has scored three goals while Shaw is yet to register a senior strike. Davies' passing accuracy is much better than Shaw's at 83 per cent compared with 70 per cent. He has the ability to become a centre back later in his career, according to former Swansea manager Michael Laudrup. Shaw thing: Davies has been compared to England and Manchester United left back Luke Shaw . Goal threat: Davies nets against West Brom in the Premier League back in September 2013 . Swansea want £12m for him. Is he worth it? If Shaw is worth £30m, then why not? He’s experienced for his age and has played in Europe seven times. Davies can also boast League Cup success in 2013... what a bargain! Is he leaving? Possibly. He’s a Swansea fan, so he obviously has emotional ties to the club and Garry Monk seems reluctant to let him go, but if his price tag is met we could see him in Liverpool colours by September. Do Liverpool even need another left back? Yes, desperately. With only Jose Enrique and Jon Flanagan at their disposal to play there Liverpool have no time to lose this summer. They have also expressed interest in Sevilla's Alberto Moreno and Ajax's Daley Blind, but Davies would be an important addition to Brendan Rodgers' squad. Capped up: The Swansea man - seen here celebrating with Gareth Bale - has already played 10 times for Wales .","Swansea's Davies a transfer target for Liverpool and Spurs .

"By . Carl Markham . Former champion David Duval does not feel disrespected being sent out in the first group for the start of the 143rd Open Championship at Royal Liverpool and insists he is just grateful to have a tee time at all. The American, who won the Claret Jug in 2001 on another north-west course at Lytham St Annes, goes out with David Howell and Robert Karlsson at 6.25am on Thursday. Some may have perceived that as not treating a former winner with the respect he deserves, but the 42-year-old does not see it that way. No problem: David Duval (right) isn't feel disrespected by being sent off in the first group at the Open . Having seen his career go into a downward spiral after his Open win, with injuries, illness and personal issues all contributing to a spectacular loss of form, Duval is keen to make the most of every opportunity. 'I don't take it as being disrespectful at all,' he said. 'I have always said I don't care when I tee off, just give me a tee time. 'I am fortunate to have been a past champion and as long as I'm playing golf I'll be coming. Rough time: Duval's form since his 2001 Open win has dropped due to injuries, illness and personal issues . 'Everyone has their opinions and favourites but I think this is the most cherished event in golf. 'I take it as Peter Dawson (R&A chief executive) sending me out to make sure the pace gets set properly. 'He is asking me to do him a favour so we're not backing up the course. 'I hope we're done by 10.25 - if it is up to me we will be.' Such an early start creates its own logistical challenges for any professional golfer, but for a player with Duval's long list of back, neck and wrist injuries there are additional difficulties. At least he has had some preparation for what lies ahead, as he practised with Tiger Woods in his customary early morning start on Tuesday. 'It is a little harder, I'm getting a little older and stiffer to get up at 4am and it takes a while to get loose and warm,"" added the former world number one, currently ranked 940th having been as low as 1,508 at the end of last year. 'I hit 5.30am balls on Tuesday morning and I still wasn't ready to tee off at 7am. 'I am contemplating whether to go to bed or not. Maybe I should go to the pub till 4am and then come over here? 'I struggle to go to bed real early but I'm going to have to figure a way to get to sleep at nine o'clock tonight - maybe watching British television will help.'

"By . Harcharan Chandhoke . While relations between England and India may have sunk below basic standards of civility, the teams are at least united by one common issue – do they have a specialist spinner good enough to play in the next Test? India, in particular, may reflect with some regret on how they lacked the confidence to select a frontline slow bowler to exploit helpful conditions in the series opener at Trent Bridge. After predictions of rain and swing at the English bowlers’ favourite venue, they were instead greeted by baking sunshine and a groundsman apologising for producing the type of flat track more readily found in Nagpur than Nottingham. Negative spin: Ravichandran Ashwin (centre) is India's best slow bowler but has a poor record away from home . It was only when a few clouds appeared for a mere hour or so on the last morning that we saw significant ball movement and an Indian batting wobble. Then the sun reappeared and the game resumed on its ponderous path to an inevitable draw. The pace bowlers on both sides toiled manfully in the circumstances, but if this is what we can expect for the rest of the series – and the forecast is for a heatwave in the opening days at Lord’s – then just imagine the havoc that could be wreaked by a skilled spinner. It is fair to ask how the land of twirlers and tweakers and doyens of the doosra can find itself in the same predicament as England in scratching around for such a man? How can the country that regularly used to field an attack of four spin bowlers now find itself unable to select even one of them to help the seamers? Well, there is one actually. His name is Ravichandran Ashwin and he reached 100 Test wickets quicker than any bowler in Indian history. Turning it on: Ashwin reached 100 Test wickets faster than any other Indian bowler in history . The 27-year-old has nine five-fors from only 18 Tests, and boasts an impressive array of variations beyond his stock off-spinner. He can even bowl the carrom ball, which is flicked out between the thumb and a bent middle finger (anyone who has played the Indian board game of the same name will understand why it is so called). There’s just one problem. Only nine of his 104 Test wickets were taken away from the dustbowls of India. Net gain: Ashwin, pictured in practice ahead of the first Test, is surely worth a place in India's team for Lord's . He was selected for just one of the four Tests that India played in South Africa and New Zealand last winter, when he went wicketless at Johannesburg while conceding 108 runs. While he has taken his wickets at 28.5 runs apiece overall, his figures are severely tarnished by a bowling average of 75 away from home. Hence the concerns over selecting him in England. But there is no doubt he is the best that India have got. And with the prospect of a long hot summer on the cards and six left-handers in the English team who won’t like the ball spinning away from their bat, it is surely time to change tack. India’s batsman have shown they can be comfortable in these conditions, and it is encouraging that the bulk of the runs at Trent Bridge came from unheralded sources like the opener Murali Vijay rather than the acknowledged stars Virat Kohli and Cheteshwar Pujara. Meanwhile the seam bowlers, while a little slower than their English counterparts and even less capable of taking the last wicket, were at least able to bowl some probing lines and lengths as well as extracting a little ball movement. Ishant Sharma and Bhuvneshwar Kumar, in particular, showed in the first innings that they can make inroads into this English batting line-up. All they needed was a proper spinner to put on a different type of pressure at the other end. Although the Indian camp has been quick to justify its selection in the first Test, and there are signs they may remain loyal to same XI for now, it would be foolish to delay Ashwin’s introduction for too long. In danger: Ashwin could replace Stuart Binny (left) or Ravindra Jadeja (right) - or India could play two spinners . Ashwin's Test bowling record: . Tests: 19 Wickets: 104 Best bowling (inns):  7/103  Best bowling (match): 12/85 Average: 28.50 5wkt inns: 9 10wkt match: 2 . The all-rounder Stuart Binny, whose innocuous up-and-down medium pacers only took up 10 out of the 145 overs India bowled at Trent Bridge, is the obvious candidate to make way. Such a move may seem harsh after his disciplined 65 helped see out the draw on the last day, but he offers no more with the bat than Ashwin – who can boast two Test centuries and a batting average nudging 40. The other option would be to leave out the spinning all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja, who may be a recognised top order batsman in Indian conditions but looked less comfortable than Binny when wielding the willow at Nottingham. The great factor in his favour, however, is that his left-arm spin dovetails nicely with that of Ashwin, who turns the ball the other way. Pitching an idea: India could go with two spinners at Lord's, no matter what the track looks like . With favourable conditions, playing the pair of them represents the best chance for India to close out a game over this long five-match series. They have won countless matches over the years through their tried and tested method of triggering a second innings collapse by crowding the bat with close fielders, incessant chatter and over-optimistic appealing. It doesn’t matter if the pitch is not entirely responsive at Lord’s, or if this tactic does not yield immediate dividends. This is simply what India do. It is in their DNA. They always do it back home and it is time to show the conviction to try it here.","Ashwin was the quickest Indian bowler to 100 Test wickets .

"By . Eleanor Crooks, Press Association . Former triathlon world champion Helen Jenkins has been ruled out of the Commonwealth Games through injury in a huge blow to Team Wales. Wales had hoped triathlon might provide two medals with Jenkins and reigning world champion Non Stanford in line to compete in Glasgow but both have been forced out. Stanford has not raced at all this season and her hopes of making the startline in Strathclyde Country Park next Thursday were ended in June when she sustained a stress fracture in her ankle as she tried to recover from a foot problem. Out: Helen Jenkins will miss the Commonwealth Games through injury . Dragon: The former world champion had been set to represent Wales in Glasgow . Tuesday's news is particularly cruel for Jenkins, the world champion in 2008 and 2011, after her hopes of Olympic gold in London were ruined by a knee injury. She raced and finished fifth but did not compete again until earlier this season and even contemplated retirement before finally getting to the bottom of the knee problem. Jenkins' comeback had been very encouraging, the 30-year-old finishing on the podium in the World Triathlon Series races in Cape Town, Chicago and Auckland to put her second in the world rankings. But she pulled out of last Saturday's race in Hamburg during the run because of a foot problem. The decision was described as precautionary but further tests have shown the injury is likely to end Jenkins' season. She said: 'I'm obviously devastated. I was very proud to be selected to represent Wales and was looking forward to racing on a tough, honest triathlon course in Strathclyde. 'I will get more information from the specialist this week but with a grade two tear of my Plantar Fascia, it's almost certain that I won't be racing again this season. 'I particularly want to thank my support team who have worked so hard to get me back racing after such a difficult 18 months after the Olympics.' Leading the pack: Jenkins represented Team GB at London 2012 . The women's race had looked set to be a mouthwatering duel between Wales and England, who will be represented by world number three Jodie Stimpson, Vicky Holland and Lucy Hall. The remaining Welsh triathletes are not medal contenders, and Brian Davies, chef de mission of Team Wales, said: 'It's undoubtedly a huge blow to the team and she'll be sorely missed but first and foremost our thoughts are with Helen. 'We wish her a speedy recovery and look forward to seeing her in action again in the near future.' Stimpson will go into the race as the gold medal favourite with her main challenge now likely to come from Australia and New Zealand.","Former world champion Jenkins ruled out of the Commonwealth Games .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . A lottery winner who bought a Grade II listed mansion with his wife after taking home a £148million fortune has moved his stable girl fiancée into the £6million property, it was reported today. Adrian Bayford and his ex-wife Gillian bought the seven-bedroom Suffolk home shortly after winning the EuroMillions jackpot in August 2012. But the couple, originally from Haverhill, Suffolk, moved out of the Georgian home after announcing their separation just 15 months after winning the jackpot. Scroll down for video . Lottery winner Adrian Bayford, 43, has reportedly moved in to the £6million Suffolk mansion he bought with his ex-wife Gillian with his new financée Samantha Burbidge, 27 . Mr Bayford met stable girl Ms Birbidge, pictured, at his local pub earlier this year. In March, the couple confirmed they were to marry in a James Bond themed wedding after a whirlwind romance . Now, Mr Bayford, 43, has moved his new fiancée Samantha Burbidge, 27, in to the Grade II listed country property, according to a friend of Mr Bayford. Richard Hudspith, 40, said the new lovers were already settled in the multi-million-pound Suffolk home. Another friend is said to have joked: 'They'll be Lord and Lady of the manor.' The couple were previously living at a £750,000 property in Haverhill, Suffolk, which Mr Bayford bought and moved in to following his divorce. The Bayfords were the second biggest lottery winners in British history when they scooped £148million two years ago. Just a year later in November 2013 the couple split - citing the stresses of their win for the breakdown of their nine-year marriage. A friend of the former postman said he and Ms Burbidge had moved into the Grade II listed mansion (pictured) The Bayfords, pictured in 2012, were the second biggest lottery winners in British history when they took home a £148million jackpot. But they split a year later due to the stress of their win . The couple told the media their relationship had ‘broken down irretrievably’ following their win - and they were officially divorced earlier this year. At the time, Mr Bayford said: 'Gillian and I have split. When you win the lottery it’s so stressful.’ Shortly after the split, it was reported that mother-of-two Mrs Bayford, 42, was in a relationship with married gardener Chris Tovey, 40. However, the former healthcare worker has always strenuously denied these claims. Then, at the end of last year, it was speculated that Mrs Bayford was in a relationship with car dealer Alan Warnock. Mr Warnock sold Mrs Bayford a fleet of Audis when she visited his dealership - which is near to her hometown of Dundee. The couple are now thought to be living on the outskirts of the Scottish city in an exclusive estate bought by Mrs Bayford. Mrs Bayford, 42, is now said to be in a relationship with former Audi dealer Alan Warnock. The couple are thought to live on an exclusive estate near to Mrs Bayford's hometown of Dundee .

However the Polish-born 30-year-old said she just worked for the multi-millionaire as his driver and bodyguard . In February this year, it was suggested that Mr Bayford was 'being comforted' by former sausage factory worker Marta Jarosz, 30. However, Polish-born Ms Jarosz claimed she was employed by the multi-millionaire as his driver and bodyguard - and that the two were not romantically linked. When asked about his relationship with Ms Jarosz, Mr Bayford said: ‘I am not with Marta. She works for me and that’s it.’ In March this year, Mr Bayford confirmed he was seeing a stable girl 16 years his junior. It is thought Mr Bayford met Ms Burbidge, who worked in a stable near to the Georgian property where the couple will now live, at a local pub. Six weeks later it was announced the pair were engaged to be married. Mr Bayford previously lived with Ms Burbidge at this five-bedroom property in Haverhill, Suffolk - which he moved in to following his separation with Mrs Bayford . It is understood Mr Bayford proposed to Ms . Burbidge during a candlelit dinner on the beach while they were on holiday at a . plush £500-a-night resort in the Maldives. The couple then celebrated their engagement with steak, chips and pints of cider at a Suffolk pub with friends . It is thought the wedding will be James Bond themed - and the bride will walk down the aisle to the 007 theme tune.

"By . Simon Boyle . Gordon Ramsay is being investigated for ‘serious fraud’ after a whistleblower leaked a damning internal document to the taxman. The explosive memo alleges that a massive unpaid tax bill – understood to be a seven-figure sum – was covered up during a previous investigation in 2010. It was written by Trevor James, former finance director of the TV chef’s restaurant empire, who  began working for him having previously investigated Ramsay on behalf of HM Revenue &  Customs. Mr James was sacked by Ramsay in mysterious circumstances earlier this year. Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay who is appearing in the new US show Junior Masterchef . Ramsay’s business was first probed by the taxman in 2005, when HMRC looked at claims that management had been abusing cash from the company’s tips fund. Ramsay was later cleared of wrongdoing by inspectors, after agreeing to pay back some outstanding tax. Now HMRC has launched a second major investigation into Gordon Ramsay Holdings, after suggestions that Mr James – who was recruited by Ramsay in 2007 – misled officials during the previous probe. Ramsay, 46, denies any wrongdoing and has employed consultants Deloitte to act for him and his  company at ‘enormous expense’, with five senior partners trawling through 30,000 emails in an attempt  to clear the chef’s name. The investigation is a civil matter, but Revenue officials have the power to bring criminal charges if individuals are found to have committed serious tax evasion, and the penalties can include jail. The leaked letter, dated 2010, is understood to have detailed how the restaurant empire had slashed its tax and National Insurance bill by hiding the facts from HMRC’s inspectors. Trouble: Ramsay, pictured with his wife Tana, is facing a fraud probe over an unpaid tax bill . The memo is believed to have boasted of Mr James’s success in reducing the company’s tax liabilities, saying the whole truth had not been told to HMRC – and also alleging that money from the staff tips fund was used inappropriately. Company reports show that Mr James officially resigned as a Gordon Ramsay director in May, with sources close to the chef claiming his position had become ‘untenable’. Mr James signed a watertight gagging clause to prevent him speaking out about the case. Ramsay’s spokesman last night insisted he had personally disclosed the document to tax officials as soon as he was made aware of it, and claimed HMRC is ‘satisfied Gordon was unaware of its contents’. However, sources connected with the business have told this news-paper that the chef was ‘well aware’ of the contents of the memo, and ‘refused advice’ from senior staff to approach the authorities. Mr James, the company’s compliance director, was hired by Gordon Ramsay Holdings from his previous role as a tax inspector. He had even been involved in the previous investigation into Ramsay’s accounting practices, and was referred to in the chef’s autobiography as ‘Mr Delve’. He later helped strike a deal with authorities which saw the business settle its affairs in 2010. He was made a director of the business when the company’s previous finance chief, Ramsay’s father-in-law Chris Hutcheson, left amid a bitter row with the chef over cash. Fiery: Ramsay, known for his abrasive onscreen personality, is coaching pre-teen cooking wannabes . Documents filed with Companies House . show Mr James’s final positions among Ramsay’s businesses were . officially terminated on May 7 this year, but one accounts document says . he ceased to act as a director on September 17, 2012. A source involved with the chef’s restaurant management yesterday . claimed the investigation had yet to be concluded, but said a new . strand of the probe had been opened recently after authorities accepted . Ramsay’s innocence. When The Mail on Sunday approached the chef about the document yesterday, while he was filming his US television show in Colorado, he said: ‘It wasn’t even to me. It wasn’t a document, it was a letter. Yeah, it wasn’t even an email. You will have to excuse me.’ The document also claims that Ramsay may have misused tips intended to be split between restaurant staff, suggesting £375,000 had not been declared to the taxman. Asked about the allegations, the chef said: ‘Complete and utter rubbish.’ The company yesterday accepted that some funds from the company’s tips account – known as a ‘Tronc fund’ – had been distributed ‘incorrectly’ but insisted that none had gone to the chef personally. A spokesman said the tips issue related to the payment of National Insurance contributions and using the tips as part of an employee’s  salary for taxation purposes, and added that Ramsay believed the Tronc issues had been resolved. It comes amid major financial concerns for the firm, which has debt liabilities of £36.6 million and cash assets of just £45,500.","Celebrity chef's business accused of hiding unpaid tax bill from officials .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Traitor: MI6 chiefs refused to denounce double agent Kim Philby, pictured in 1955, despite him helping fellow Soviet agents escape to Russia . Britain's spy chiefs refused to denounce traitor Kim Philby for years despite him helping fellow Soviet agents escape to Russia, newly released documents have revealed. The previously top secret Downing Street file contains documents showing how MI6 maintained that Philby was innocent, and believed it would be 'un-English to label him a traitor based on suspicion. Major General Sir John Sinclair, the head of the Secret Intelligence Service in the mid-1950s, also stated that the master-spy had helped uncover the identities of other agents, including Donald Maclean. In documents prepared for then-Prime . Minister, Harold Macmillan in 1963, following Philby's defection to the . Soviet Union from Beirut, the Major General had said that the spy should . not have to prove he was innocent. 'It is entirely contrary to the English tradition for a man to have to . prove his innocence even when the prosecution is in possession of hard . facts,' he had argued in his defence, which dates from 12955, according to the Telegraph. In 1951, Philby resigned from his role . as the senior SIS liaison officer in Washington DC, after his fellow . Cambridge Spies Maclean and Guy Burgess vanished. Although suspicions cast a long shadow over Philby, there was not enough evidence to prosecute him. Fresh evidence fingering him as the infamous Third Man came to light in 1955 via a Soviet defector in Australia and a question was put to Parliament in which Philby was named as the Third Man. However, MI6 was still defending Philby, with Sir John telling Mr Macmillan, who was at that time foreign secretary, by letter that other evidence 'reduced very considerably' the suspicions that Philby might have been a Soviet spy. Defected: Donald Maclean (left) and Guy Burgess (right) both escaped to the Soviet Union . Information from Philby had led to the senior British diplomat Maclean being unmasked, and had exposed scientists Klaus Fuchs and Allan Nunn May, who were key figures in revealing the how the atomic bomb was created to Moscow. A report written by MI5 lawyer Helenus Milmo, who led the 1951 investigation concluded that  Philby was a Soviet agent, but the findings were disputed by Sir John - who said it had not managed to provide evidence that Philby was the Third Man. It is constructed of suppositions and circumstantial ­evidence, summing up in a circular argument everything the ingenuity of a prosecutor would devise against a suspect. It seems likely to remain as a permanently accusing ­finger pointed at Philby,' he wrote. Double agent: Kim Philbyin Russia with his fourth wife Rufina Ivanovna Pukhova in 1975 . By then working as a journalist for both The Observer and The Economist, Philby moved to Lebanon in 1956, and continued to work for MI5 part-time. In 1962 an MI6 officer Nicholas Elliot manged to get Philby to admit to his double dealings, only for Philby to refuse to sign the confession. The following year Philby vanished from a party at the  British embassy in Beirut, leaving his wife Eleanor behind, and escaped to Russia. He died in 1988 aged 76.","Downing Street file shows spy chiefs refused to denounce Philby .

"By . Jane Shilling . The U.S. television journalist Dan Harris has had plenty to worry about in his time. In his days as a reporter he saw the bodies of Palestinians being bulldozed into a mass grave; he was caught up in an anti-American mob in Pakistan and shot at by the Taliban. Yet the thing that really bothered him was the prospect of going bald. On the way home from reporting on an isolated Amazonian tribe, he locked himself in the plane loo to examine his receding hairline, contemplating a vision of his future that went: 'Baldness = Unemployment = Flophouse in Duluth' (a byword for cultural desolation since Gore Vidal's 1983 novel of that name). Cell reading: Paris Hilton took the The Power Of Now to jail with her in 2007 . His wife-to-be, Bianca, assured him his hair was not about to set him on the fast track to destitution. So did his psychiatrist, from whom he had sought help after turning to drugs after a long stint of war reporting. But in vain. At 37, in love and with his career soaring, Harris was beset with anxiety. At this serendipitous moment, his producer suggested he should read a book by someone named Eckhart Tolle. Her exact words were: 'You might like him. It's all about controlling your ego.' Tolle, it transpired, had written a couple of self-help books , which became celebrity sensations. Jim Carrey endorsed The Power Of Now;  Paris Hilton took it to jail with her; and Meg Ryan gave a copy to Oprah Winfrey, who plugged it on her show. 'At first,' Harris writes, 'the book struck me as irredeemable poppycock.' But, unexpectedly, 'Tolle began to unfurl a fascinating thesis that made me think he must have spent an enormous amount of time inside my skull'. The revelation concerned the inner critic in our heads that provides an unhelpful running commentary on our actions. Thriving on drama, resentment and ambition, obsessed with the past and the future, heedless of the present, it's never satisfied. The realisation that 'the voice inside my head was kind of an a**hole' was the start of a remarkable conversion to the practice of mindfulness. Convert: Despite the pain from the posture, Dan became a fan of meditation . It wasn't a straightforward journey. Harris's journalistic scepticism kept kicking in at inconvenient moments, such as a ten-day meditation retreat where the rules included 'no talking, no reading, no sex'. He spent his 39th birthday there, tormented by back pain from the yogic postures and infuriated by the drippy voice of a shawl-wearing teacher named (inevitably) Spring. Unconvinced by Tolle's uneasy melange of good sense and mystic waffle, Harris finally found a plausible guru in the person of a Harvard-educated psychiatrist, author and Buddhist Dr  Mark Epstein, who managed to convey the essential principles of mindfulness and compassion without the dismaying accretion of loopy psycho-babble. Five years since Harris first heard of Tolle, he hasn't quite achieved enlightenment. His ego still seems on fine form, to judge by the way he compares himself with St Paul. And his satisfaction at finding himself in the vanguard of a fashionable movement is touching: these days almost everyone acknowledges the benefits of mindfulness. Not everyone will find Harris a congenial guide to mindfulness. His gung-ho journalistic style, fearlessly sprinkled with cliche and innocent of irony, is an unusual conduit for the message of compassion and calm. But his answer to a colleague sceptical of 'the whole meditation thing', is remarkably persuasive. 'I do it,' he said, 'because it makes me 10 per cent happier.'","U.S. television journalist Dan Harris was beset with anxiety .

"By . Sam Greenhill . High Court judge Mrs Justice Pauffley told the couple to settle their differences over a cup of tea - and they managed it, which she described as 'pleasing' A mother and father waged war for 10 years over their twin boys until a despairing judge ordered them to sort it out over a ‘nice cup of tea’. During their bitter decade of conflict, the former couple had endured 24 court appearances arguing over custody of the children. But the family judge’s simple suggestion brought miraculous results, with the parents now seeing eye-to-eye and sharing contact with their sons. Mrs Justice Pauffley told the High Court yesterday: ‘I suggested that, when the boys were dropped off and picked up, each parent should be made welcome in the home of the other, invited to sit down around the kitchen table and offered a cup of tea. ‘Pleasingly, very pleasingly, against the background of the last 10 years, each parent reacted positively to that idea and it’s been good for the boys.’ She added: ‘The father, impressively, has taken the trouble to provide supplies of a particular health-giving drink for the mother, and I’m sure the mother has been responding with similar thoughtfulness when he’s called in at her home.’ It was even suggested they might now graduate to seeing each other over dinner, leaving other members of their families ‘gobsmacked’ at the outbreak of peace. The protracted battle began not long after the twins were born prematurely 12 years ago. They weighed just three pounds each and needed to spend the first eight weeks of their lives in hospital. Even though their parents were described as ‘very respectable’ and in a long-term relationship, it put ‘enormous pressure’ on them, the court heard. When the little boys came home, they were extremely weak and the mother was ‘intensely protective of them’. The father ‘felt excluded’ and the parents’ relationship crumbled under the strain. They split up before the twins reached their first birthday, and spent the next decade at war in the family courts. When the mother and father - who have not been named - arrived for their umpteenth court hearing, the weary judge observed: ‘My sense was that I could have been doing little more than applying a sticking plaster to a deep and persistently infected wound.’ But, after the father described everyone in the family as ‘exhausted’ by the never-ending legal war, the judge made her cup of tea suggestion and sense began to prevail. During their bitter decade of conflict, the former couple had endured 24 court appearances arguing over custody of the children, but Mrs Justice Pauffley told the High Court they had reacted to her advice positively . Both mother and father, ‘to their very great credit’, made concessions and agreed to build bridges. The mother began to appreciate the father’s point of view, and he agreed it was impossible for him to say that she had ‘poisoned’ the children against him. The mother had ‘felt under attack’ by her ex-partner and her sense that he was constantly ‘dragging her to court’ had become ‘almost too much for her to bear’, however, she had now come to recognise the importance of the father’s role in her boys’ lives. After hot drinks warmed hearts around the kitchen table, the ‘quiet, respectful, polite and exceptionally well behaved’ 12-year-old boys wrote moving thank-you letters to the judge and came to London to meet her in her chambers. The judge said: ‘If there was one thing the parents seemingly failed to do for all of the years they were in dispute, it was that they did not consider the impact upon the other - and the children themselves - of their actions.’ The judge added: ‘I am hopeful, very hopeful, that for the future similar mistakes will not be made. There is very little which frightens children more than an absence of appropriate parental guidance and firm boundaries about the things in life that matter most.’ The boys will now spend alternate weekends with each parent - who have both found new partners - and contact over school holidays and half terms will be shared more or less equally. Mrs Justice Pauffley concluded: ‘The details will be worked out by the parents. They welcome without hesitation the firm message that this is a final order, that there is no need for any further court involvement and that any return to litigation would be a profoundly retrograde step.‘Thus, they are empowered to make the arrangements, whatever they might amount to, work.‘It has been a privilege to participate in this most satisfactory of collaborative efforts.’","The former couple had 24 court appearances over custody of the children .

"By . Peter Lewis . Incredible story: Footballer Johnny Sherwood . Hear a voice from the dead bring alive one of the horror stories of the war. One that will make you grit your teeth in order to read on. Johnny Sherwood survived the death camps on the Burma-Siam railway, which was built alongside the notorious River Kwai. He was dubbed 'Lucky Johnny' by his mother - and over every kind of danger of death his luck held. He was restored to his beloved wife and children, but suffered from appalling nightmares that took him back to the Kwai and the sadistic Japanese, who inflicted inhuman behaviour on their prisoners. Every night, he would wake up shouting. Doctors and sedatives did not help, so he decided to write it all down. Day after day for years he retreated to his small room to confront the painful past. It worked. His nightmares grew fewer. By the time he signed off the last chapter in 1984, the events were 40 years in the past. He still remembered them in every detail as if it were yesterday. He died of a heart attack the following year. His manuscript and all his souvenirs were stored in his mother's attic and only recently rediscovered during a house move. His grandson, Michael, discovered the text, realised its value and has got it published, as Johnny wanted it to be. What is so remarkable about his tale - for the story of the River Kwai has been told in other prisoners' memoirs - is Johnny's heart-warming humanity, which persists through the blackest times. 'Lucky Johnny' was one of 11 children. His luck began on the day he was spotted kicking a football in a Reading park by a scout from the local football club. Invited to train, he was bought his first pair of proper boots. He became the star centre-forward of Reading FC, 'The Royals'. In 1938, he was invited to tour the world with the Corinthians team, a hugely successful side in which he was top scorer - 70 goals in 70 matches. An England career was mooted for him. But the war came, he joined the Royal Artillery as a sergeant PE instructor, and was one of the reinforcements rounded up, far too late, to defend Singapore. After many days of air bombardment, the island governor capitulated. Then followed three-and-a-half years of captivity, mostly spent driving the railway from Burma to Siam through virgin jungle under the merciless hands of Japanese and Korean guards. Their only English was ‘Speedo-speedo’ accompanied by a beating with rifle butts. I have read about it before, but this time I felt I was living it. Johnny is such a straightforward, decent bloke, transparently honest, so you know there's no exaggeration. And he is a writer of vivid simple English. Johnny was in his late 20s, sturdy and fit from years of pro football, yet he nearly died of malaria. 'We had the rice sack ready to put you in,' a medical orderly told him. He was also helped by his sunny, hopeful temperament. I grew to like as well as admire Johnny very much. He reproduces a lot of the chat or banter between the prisoners and it is clear that when they were in despair it was to him they turned for comfort. He assured them they had only to stick to it and they would see their loved ones again - not that he always believed it. He diverted their thoughts with tales of his own marriage and of the exotic places he had been on his world football tour. He even organised  singsongs and quizzes. Johnny survived the death camps on the Burma-Siam railway that were dramatised in the film The Bridge on the River Kwai . One of Johnny's mental escapes was to dream of the wife he had known for only three years and married only months before the war. Christine was a former Miss Reading, a beauty queen, and he worshipped her. He tried to imagine what she and their toddler were doing. 'I'd been away now for half the time we knew each other. Did she still keep a place in her heart for me?' Johnny quickly realised the pleasure the guards took in humiliating their captives: 'The more they make us suffer, the more they enjoy it, the fanatical bastards.' Every man stole or bartered for extra food, naturally enough. But if caught... one man he saw made to kneel with his arms tied day after day in the blazing sun with tins of food and water placed just outside his reach. Men who could hardly stand were made to hold weights above their head and beaten if they lowered them. 27 pc of Japanese prisoners of war died in captivity . Curiously, the one thing that brought any mercy from the guards was football. Hearing Johnny was a professional, they asked him and his friends to clear a pitch and make up a team for games of Guards v Prisoners. 'These devils, so cruel to us by day, could smile and kick around with us in the evening. It was hard for us not to beat them every game but they took it well. 'Not many of us had any footwear left at this stage. I was worried about my feet. But the Japs gave us pairs of plimsolls to put on. From then on, we often played a sort of football with them in the evenings.' One evening, Johnny started juggling with the football. A guard, who owned the ball, asked him to teach him some tricks. 'I give food,' he said. 'I taught him a few fancy things and, for the first time I remember, a Jap kept his promise. We kept getting extra food for playing.' In the evenings, Johnny sought peace by sitting on the hillside beside the cemetery contemplating the crosses of the men he had known. 'Yes, I cried for them, more than I have ever cried in my life. If only the guards had been more human and treated us as prisoners should be, thousands who died would have survived.' Liberation came at last. Johnny’s return home had been the dream that kept his morale from crumbling. When at last he returned home, it was to a tremendous hero’s welcome. But people were shocked at his appearance. The well-built footballer they remembered was now 'stick-thin'. But he did go on to play for Reading again, before chancing his luck by becoming a bookie.","Johnny Sherwood survived the death camps on the Burma-Siam railway .

"By . Mike Dawes . Andrew Flintoff trained on the outfield with Lancashire before day two of their LV= County Championship match against Somerset after his return to cricket over the weekend. The 36-year-old former England captain seemed to be feeling the effects of his exertions at St Annes, tweeting on Monday: 'Still a bit stiff from Saturdays 12 overs just bowled 5 more now for a rub !' However, Flintoff showed flashes of his old genius during his comeback for St Annes, taking a superb caught-and-bowled among his three wickets. Throwing his hat into the ring: Andrew Flintoff trains with the Lancashire team at Old Trafford . Catch him if you can: Flintoff's return is expected to raise attendances at Old Trafford . VIDEO: Watch Flintoff's stunning caught-and-bowled . And if he pulls one of those beauties out during the NatWest T20 Blast, it will justify Lancashire's pay incentive. Flintoff is set to cash in on his return to top-level cricket by taking a portion of the gate receipts for Lancashire’s Twenty20 home matches. It is understood the all-rounder, who is hopeful of ending his five-year absence from the game on Friday as Lancashire host Roses rivals Yorkshire at Old Trafford, will receive £1 for every spectator who turns up over and above a pre-agreed figure —  possibly 8,000. The county’s two home matches so far in the Natwest T20 Blast have pulled in crowds of 5,300 against Worcestershire and 5,900 against Warwickshire. Laughing all the way to the bank: Flintoff will receive a payment per fan for Lancashire's home games . Last year’s home fixture against Yorkshire drew a crowd of over 12,000 — more than double the figure they achieved for any  of their four other Twenty20 games in Manchester. Since Jos Buttler, fresh from his heroic 121 off 74 balls in England’s defeat by Sri Lanka at Lord’s on Saturday, may also be available for selection for Lancashire, the opportunity will be there for Flintoff to add a few  thousand pounds to a deal that already includes appearance fees and win bonuses. Flintoff is dreaming of a return against bitter rivals Yorkshire, but insists he only wants to play if he proves this week he is good enough for ‘cricket reasons’. Freddie, 36, came through a low-key playing comeback on Saturday by helping St Annes beat Penrith in a lowly Northern Premier League game. Comeback: Flintoff returned to cricket when he played for St Annes on Saturday . Low key: The former England all-rounder took three wickets on his return to the game . He knows if he gets selected for Lancashire on the big stage now, somebody else will have to miss out and he does not want to get a game for sympathy reasons. ‘I’d be lying to you if I said I didn’t think about playing against Yorkshire,’ said Flintoff. ‘It will be a full house, however, Friday is a long way away, it really is — if I get a  go, I get a go but I’m not by any means expecting to play. ‘On Thursday I’ve got a game with the Lancashire second team, which I’m just going to go out there and enjoy. I’m not going to put any undue pressure on myself  thinking that this is a trial for Friday or anything like that. I’m just going to play — and if I get picked, I get picked. ‘If I’m . going to play then someone else is going to miss out. They’ve got to be . comfortable that, when they tell the player who is missing out, it’s the . right decision for cricket reasons. And I need to be comfortable with . that as well. ‘So . it’s all down to cricket, down to what value I can give the side and . whether I can give more than the  person I take over from.’ After . Saturday’s cameo, which include facing three balls as a batsman before . being caught on the  boundary attempting a six, he stressed how the . competition for Lancashire is especially tough now. Realistic: Flintoff said he is not putting too much pressure on himself ahead of his comeback . Target: Flintoff has set his sights on playing against rivals Yorkshire on Friday night . ‘I’m not putting too much  pressure on myself,’ added Flintoff. ‘I’m not making big hopes. ‘I’m just going to see where it goes. I appreciate that Lancashire are on a roll in Twenty20s and there’s Jos Buttler and Jimmy Anderson and people to come back into that side. ‘So it’s not a gimme that I’m going to play. But I’m going to try to put myself in the frame. The comeback has just crept up on me. It’s not something that was a goal of mine, that I set out to do. ‘It has just come around quite  innocently and that’s been the nice thing about it. I’m not chasing anything. I’m just  enjoying it. Why shouldn’t I? I like cricket.’ With Freddie Flintoff offered a portion of the Old Trafford gate for his return to top-level cricket, Sportsmail takes a look at other stipulations which sports stars have requested...

"By . Victoria Woollaston . The two countries were once at loggerheads over the use of nuclear warheads, but now the U.S. and Russia have joined forces to develop the technology together - and the partnership could one day lead to weapons being used to destroy asteroids hurtling towards earth. Last month an agreement between the two countries was signed outlining the use of technology to create 'international safeguards' and offer 'defense from asteroids.' The move signals a step closer towards the technology being used for such projects and builds on the work of various leading nuclear experts who have been actively developing the idea in recent years. Scroll down for video . More than 1,600 people were injured by the shock wave from the explosion, estimated to be as strong as 20 Hiroshima atomic bombs, as it landed near the city of Chelyabinsk . Entitled the 'Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Russian Federation on Cooperation in Nuclear - and Energy-Related Scientific Research and Development', the document provides the legal framework needed to expand cooperation between U.S. and Russian nuclear research laboratories. It was signed by the U.S. Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz and Director General of the Russian Federation State Corporation Sergey Kirienko, on 16 September. It is hoped the new agreement will complement provisions of the U.S.-Russian Agreement for Cooperation in the Field of Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy, that came into force in January 2011. 'This agreement supports President Obama’s non-proliferation and climate priorities by providing a venue for scientific collaboration and relationship-building between the U.S. and Russian research and technical communities,' said Energy Secretary Moniz at the time. Nasa claims astronomers have detected . more than 10,000 asteroids with orbits that could potentially bring . them closer, or in contact, with earth since 1995. Around 9 per cent of these are believed to be around 3,000 feet long, according to reports in The Atlantic. The most threatening of these, . predicted to strike only once every 700,000 to 100 million years, could . desolate the planet. This impact would be similar to that caused by the asteroid thought to have killed . off the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. A 60-foot asteroid damaged around 4,000 buildings in Russia when it exploded over the town . of Chelyabinsk earlier this year. Yet, objects this large are said . to only plummet to earth once every 100 years or so. Rocks around 460ft long, that would have 300 megatons of force, hit every 30,000 years. 'Jointly, these communities will work to further develop advanced technologies that can address some of our most pressing nuclear energy and nuclear security challenges.' The original plans to join forces date back to 1995 when nuclear weapons designers from the Soviet Union and the U.S. met to discuss the imminent threat of asteroids and how technology could prevent it. Since that time Nasa claims astronomers have detected more than 10,000 asteroids with orbits that could potentially bring them closer, or in contact, with earth. Around nine per cent of these are believed to be around 3,000 feet long, according to reports in The Atlantic. The most threatening of these, predicted to strike only once every 700,000 to 100 million years, could desolate the planet - similar to the asteroid believed to have killed off the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. However, as Douglas Birch from the The Center of Public Integrity, explains: 'even smaller rocks between 460 and 3,170 feet wide can flatten cities or wreak havoc.' The theory has also been used in science fiction films, for example, in the 1998 blockbuster film Armageddon, an asteroid the size of Texas threatens earth and a team of astronauts, led by Bruce Willis, fly towards it and blow it up. Two years ago, research physicist and nuclear . weapons designer David Dearborn, from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in . California received a discretionary grant for his work into solving how the weapons could be used. His work runs parallel to that of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, where American nuclear weapons are designed. Research scientist Robert Weaver, from the laboratory, has been studying the effects of detonations on . asteroids since 2012 and has simulated explosions using the Energy Department’s Cielo supercomputer. In the 1998 blockbuster film Armageddon, an asteroid the size of Texas threatens earth and a team of astronauts, led by Bruce Willis, pictured, fly towards it and blow it up . Elsewhere, . Keith Holsapple, from Washington University recently received a . million-dollar research grant from Nasa to discover if an 'impact device . or nuclear explosion could deflect an asteroid from . its path.' Holsapple told Douglas Birch from - who has conducted a series of interviews with these leading experts - he is using a device called a 'gas gun' set up at Nasa’s Ames . Research Center to study the impacter. He . explained that a complete nuclear deflection could work if researchers . knew about the imminent danger around a decade in advance. If the time to impact was closer than that, Hosapple added 'it would be too late for deflection . but a carefully executed nuke strike would prevent most damage.' A 60-foot asteroid damaged around 4,000 buildings when it exploded over Russia earlier this year. The city of Chelyabinsk, pictured, 900 miles east of Moscow and close to the Kazakhstan border, took the brunt of the impact.

The likelihood of the plans being put into action, however, could be limited after President Obama announced in 2009 he is committed 'to seeking a world without nuclear weapons', and the plans could potentially go against the 1967 Outer Space Treaty signed by 129 countries, that prevents using nuclear weapons in space. Concerns have been raised about radioactive debris falling to earth.","The two countries signed an agreement to research nuclear technology .

"By . Julie Anne Barnes . Television coverage of the Commonwealth Games opening ceremony was last night under threat after BBC workers announced a 12-hour strike. Thousands of journalists and technicians at the corporation will walk out next Wednesday, jeopardising coverage of the flagship event that evening. Singers Rod Stewart, Susan Boyle and Amy Macdonald will join 3,000 volunteer performers for the ceremony at Glasgow’s Celtic Park, watched by a global TV audience of one billion. Thousands of journalists and technicians at the corporation will walk out next Wednesday, jeopardising coverage of the opening ceremony. Pictured, an artist's impression of Celtic Park during the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. But the BBC’s coverage of the event, hosted by Gary Lineker, Hazel Irvine and Clare Balding, is now at risk after members of the NUJ, Bectu and Unite unions voted in favour of industrial action, to run from midday to midnight on Wednesday, in a dispute over pay. Last night the corporation was unable to say whether or not viewers face a blackout, and whether or not emergency staff would be drafted in. Critics have attacked the decision, describing the walkout as unnecessary. Scottish Tory sports spokesman Liz Smith said: ‘The news of this strike is extremely disappointing, especially because it is clearly deliberately timed  to coincide with the launch of the  Commonwealth Games. ‘There is absolutely no need for this strike to go ahead. ‘When athletes have given up so much to train and prepare for the opportunity of a lifetime, the various unions are preparing to strike, which has the potential to cause completely unnecessary unrest just when the Games are beginning.’ The BBC¿s coverage of the event, hosted by Gary Lineker, Hazel Irvine and Clare Balding, is now at risk after members of the NUJ, Bectu and Unite unions voted in favour of industrial action . The turnout for the NUJ ballot has not been disclosed, but 77 per cent of its members voted for strike action. Some 79 per cent of Bectu staff came out in favour but it is understood only 42 per cent of BBC members voted in its ballot. Campaigners said journalists at the corporation have seen a 10 per cent pay cut in real terms over the past five years and that too much is being spent on salaries and perks for managers. NUJ general secretary Michelle Stanistreet described the turnout in the strike ballot as ‘decisive’, adding that the result ‘clearly  demonstrates that journalists across the BBC are not prepared to put up with paltry pay deals any longer’. She added: ‘Members are prepared to take sustained action in this dispute and will name further dates if it is not resolved.’ Singers Rod Stewart (left) and Amy Macdonald (right) will join 3,000 volunteer performers for the ceremony . Gerry Morrissey, general secretary of Bectu, said: ‘The BBC can find money for vanity projects but cannot find money for its own staff, whose pay has dropped by 10 per cent in the past five years.’ The BBC has offered staff earning less than £50,000 a year an increase of £650, with those earning more than £50,000 receiving £500. When the Games were hosted by Manchester in 2002, they reached 40.3million people – nearly 73 per cent of the UK population – while the audience peaked at 9.7million for the closing ceremony. The BBC has promised that Glasgow 2014 will be its biggest Commonwealth Games, with 1,300 hours of live coverage. A BBC spokesman said: ‘We will do all we can to bring our audience uninterrupted coverage of the Commonwealth Games. ‘We will continue to speak to the unions in an attempt to resolve this dispute. However, we have made an improved offer and are mindful that we need to make significant savings and deliver more for less.’ A spokesman for Glasgow 2014 and Games Partners said: ‘The BBC are doing all they can to bring full coverage of the Glasgow 2014 Opening Ceremony to audiences.’","Union walkout could hit coverage of flagship sporting event in Scotland .

"By . Deborah Andrews . A catwalk model who wowed audiences before London Fashion Week revealed today how she was born a man and is about to undergo a sex swap. Nicole Gibson, 32, from Horsham, West Sussex, grew up as a boy called Glen and was cruelly tormented by playground bullies. Nicole came out as a gay male in her . teens and began wearing women’s clothing in her 20s before starting . hormone replacement therapy two years ago. Scroll down for video . Dream come true: Transgender model Nicole Gibson's catwalk ambitions were realised this week as she took part in a London Fashion Week show . Unbeknown to her mother, Nicole had been paying to see three different psychiatrists. She had also been accepted for NHS funding for a sex change, a procedure which costs between £12,000 and £14,000 . After embarking on the course of hormones, Nicole saw her previously masculine body change shape. Her figure became shapely and womanly, and her breasts grew to a size 32B. Nicole soon left her pub job to pursue a career on the catwalk. And this week her modelling dream came to fruition as she stepped out onto the catwalk in a designer dress as part of Catwalk For Change, a fashion show held to challenge the lack of diversity in the industry. The final part of her transformation will happen on Thursday when Nicole goes under the knife to become a fully-fledged woman. The model was born as a boy called Glen, right, but started hormone replacement therapy two years ago . Nicole said: 'The fashion show was amazing. They say you have not really made it as a model until you walk along the catwalk in a sheer dress with your nipples showing - and here I was doing it in my first show. Luckily thanks to the hormones I have quite a nice pair now. I didn’t have time to get nervous, I was just so excited.' Nicole knew she was different from a very young age. While other boys were out playing, she wanted to dress up in her grandmother’s dresses. 'I didn't know what I was feeling but I knew I wasn't the same as everyone else,' she said. 'I used to dress up in dresses and pretend I was Elizabeth Taylor in the Blue Bird - but I told everyone else I was pretending to be a wizard. 'And I might not have ever been on the catwalk before now, but I had plenty practice strutting up and down my living room aged ten to George Michael’s Too Funky.' Final step: Nicole said she can't wait to have the op to make her sex swap complete . Nicole came out as gay in her teens, but still did not feel 'right' in herself. In her 20s, she began sneaking out in dresses and heels. But it took until she was 30 to pluck up the courage to find out about becoming a woman - which is when she started taking hormones. Nicole, who is now brimming with confidence, said she was looking forward to taking the final step towards becoming a woman with her NHS-funded operation. 'I’m starting to get nervous,' she said. 'To me it is just something that I have to do. It is like having two horns on my head that I have to get rid of to become the person that I have always felt I was inside.' Nicole was spotted by Models of Diversity - an alternative modelling organisation - after she uploaded shots to an online agency. It hosted its own show on September 6 at upmarket venue Waterlily ahead of London Fashion Week. Industry experts were so impressed with Nicole she has already been booked to work at the Ideal Home Show in London later this year.","Nicole Gibson, 32, grew up as a boy called Glen .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Tributes have been paid to popular BBC presenter Komla Dumor who died suddenly at his home in London. The broadcaster said Mr Dumor, who presented BBC World News and Focus On Africa, had died at his home yesterday, at the age of 41. One of Ghana's best known journalists, Mr Dumor joined the BBC in 2007 after a decade of working in broadcast journalism in his native Ghana, where he had won the Ghana Journalist of the Year award. Respected: Journalist Komla Dumor, who presented BBC World News and Focus On Africa, had died at his London home yesterday, at the age of 41 . Mr Dumor, who was born in Accra, Ghana, in 1972 hosted Network Africa for the BBC World Service between 2007 and 2009 before joining The World Today programme. In 2009 he became the first host of Africa Business Report on BBC World News. Earlier this year he was named one of New African's 100 most influential Africans in 2013. 'Komla's many friends and colleagues across Africa and the world will be as devastated as we are by this shocking news,' said Director of BBC Global News, Peter Horrocks. 'Komla was a leading light of African journalism - committed to telling the story of Africa as it really is. Africa's energy and enthusiasm seemed to shine through every story Komla told. He will be deeply missed. 'The sympathies of all his colleagues at the BBC are with his family and friends.' BBC Director of News, James Harding, said: 'It is hard to believe that Komla is no longer with us because, in every way, he was larger than life. 'He had such an infectious enthusiasm for life, for Africa, for the story. He was an inspiring journalist, both on screen and off it. 'He played a singular role in transforming the coverage of Africa, not only for the BBC but across broadcasting. And he brought a depth of understanding, a great deal of courage, a joyous charm and boundless charisma to his work. Tributes: Mr Dumor was described as a 'leading light of African journalism' by Director of BBC Global News, Peter Horrocks . 'He was adored by the people who worked with him and we will miss him deeply. Our thoughts are with his family and friends.' BBC Radio 4 Today presenter .

"By . Laura Cox . A crazed woman had to be restrained by fellow air passengers after she started raging about having an explosive device implanted within her. The terrifying incident forced the pilot of U.S. Airways flight 787, traveling from Paris to Charlotte, North Carolina, to divert and make an emergency landing. Fighter jets were scrambled to intercept the the troubled plane and guided it into land at a Maine airport, where passengers were evacuated and the woman arrested. Scroll down for video . Out of control: The woman was restrained by other passengers while doctors on board examined her for signs of recent surgery . Cut-short: Passengers were evacuated from the plane and the woman arrested. Three-and-a-half hours later they were allowed back on and the plane continued its journey . In video footage given to ABC passengers can be seen wrestling with the woman following her potentially fatal claim, initially made in a note to cabin crew. She is French citizen, born in Cameroon, Africa, who was set to visit the U.S. for 10 days, CNN reported, but had no checked luggage. Doctors on board the flight examined her, but found no evidence of wounds or scars that would indicate recent surgery, according to the news channel. US officials told NBC that initial reports suggested the passenger, a woman, appeared to be mentally unstable. Officials told CBS she will be taken for medical evaluation and likely faces federal charges of interfering with a flight crew. Evacuation: Video footage captured buses on the tarmac near the plane . Andrew Kobayashi, a passenger on board at the time, told CNN that crew at first said the unexpected landing was due to a fuel issue and strong headwinds. The pilot later apologised for the misleading annoucnement. Kobayashi was sitting five rows in front of the woman who was arrested and recalled her as looking 'nervous and jittery'. The airport manager described her behaviour as 'unruly'. Another passenger, 20-year-old student Alexa Moore, also seated five rows in front, was returning from a mission in Africa. Moore said she had noticed the woman get up to go to the bathroom holding her stomach and recalled several announcements asking if there was a doctor on board. A short time later the pilot announced they were low on fuel and would be diverting, she said. 'We didn't know what was going on,' she told the news channel, describing 'jaws-dropping' as police officers boarded the plane. 'I thought she probably had like some drugs on the plane but it was just like crazy. I was pretty shocked.' Emergency: The plane was traveling from Paris, France to Charlotte, North Carolina but had to be diverted to Bangor, Maine . U.S. Airways flight 787 was diverted due to a security issue . Security at airports was stepped up after al Qaeda claimed to have developed surgically implanted explosive devices. Officials believed terrorists may use the bombs in attempt to blow up planes on the eve of Osama bin Laden's death. Notorious chief bomb maker Ibrahim al-Asiri claimed to be behind the bombs that would evade airport scanners. al-Asiri was responsible for building the underwear bomb used to try to bring down a Detroit-bound jetliner on Christmas 2009. He also created and the printer-cartridge bombs intercepted in U.S.-bound cargo planes a year later. It is not known whether the arrested woman had any links to a terrorist organisation but it was enough to spark panic in the wake of recent reports that al Qaeda has been trying to make such devices. The plane had to be diverted following the woman's outburst at around 12 noon, as it moved over Nova Scotia, Canada, touching down in Bagnor, Maine which is two hours from its intended destination. The North American Aerospace Defense confirmed that two F15 aircraft had been dispatched to help with the plane's landing. It had departed from Charles de Gaulle airport at around 11am local time and was due to touch down in Charlotte Douglas International at around 2.30pm. There were 179 passengers and nine crew members on board the Boeing 767 when it was forced to make its emergency landing. Video footage captured buses on the tarmac near the plane as passengers were evacuated. '[We are] aware of reports of a passenger who exhibited suspicious behavior during flight,' the Transport Security Administration said in a statement. 'Out of an abundance of caution the flight was diverted to BGR where it was met by law enforcement.' Once the woman had been taken into custody passengers were allowed back on the plane and it was cleared to resume after about three-and-a-half hours, officials said. Authorities investigating why the woman made the bizarre claim have said there were no explosives on her body.

He described his ‘amazing joy’ at finally being reunited with her. He had stayed with a caring family in that time but struggled to communicate as he could not speak a word of English. ‘The things I have gone through I wouldn’t wish anyone to go through,’ Berahino says in a video released exclusively to MailOnline. ‘I thank England for giving me a second chance and making it easy to follow the dream I have always had to become a footballer.’ Personal story: Berahino spoke our about his childhood as a refugee in a video to mark World Refugee Day on June 20 . Berahino was approached by the United Nations and asked to tell his side of the story – for the first time on video and in such depth – to coincide with World Refugee Day on June 20. Burundi was torn apart by ethnic conflict between 1993 and 2005, and forced more than 1.5 million people, including Berahino, to flee their homes and leave everything behind. ‘It was a tough time for me,’ he says. ‘I didn’t really understand what was happening around the country because I was still a young boy. ‘In the late 1990s we had to leave the country, I separated from my mother and stayed with one of her friends. We flew to Tanzania, from there we had to catch buses, we had to walk. I was kept apart for two years before meeting my mother in England.’ Berahino adds: ‘Any refugees out there, never give up.

And the Chelsea Supporters' Trust have spoken out to say that they welcome the new development in Chelsea's long-running stadium saga and the attempts to expand Stamford Bridge - an apparent u-turn from the club's previous attempts to move away to the likes of Earls Court and Battersea Power Station. Blue heaven: Chelsea are exploring options regarding the expansion of their home ground, Stamford Bridge . European nights: Financial Fair Play regulations have increased Chelsea's need for an increased capacity . The statement from the Supporters' Trust also offers Chelsea existing comments and suggestions from local residents recorded by the Trust that could help Chelsea in the initial consultation phase of the study. Stamford Bridge's capacity currently sits at 41,837 and the Blues have previously explored the possibility of moving to nearby Battersea power station and Earls Court, options which are no longer there. By potentially utilising decking over the railway lines to the east and north of the ground Chelsea believe they could get around the obstacles associated with expansion on their relatively small West London site. Boy in blue: New signing Cesc Fabregas could be playing in front of a bigger Stamford Bridge crowd . Chelsea had previously been accused by shareholders in Chelsea Pitch Owners (CPO) - the fan-led company which owns the land beneath Stamford Bridge - of not fully exploring the possibility of staying put before attempting to buy back the stadium freehold in October 2011. That was seen as a precursor to a move to a new 60,000-seater ground, something Chelsea are unable to do before convincing CPO to sell up - and Abramovich and Chelsea now seem to have made a significant u-turn. A potential expansion would help Chelsea to boost their matchday revenue. Stamford Bridge is currently the Premier League's eighth largest ground. A 60,000 capacity would improve that ranking to third. Familiar: Chelsea have spent their entire history at Stamford Bridge and the new plans could see them stay . The Chelsea Supporters Trust welcomes the recent announcement by Chelsea FC regarding commissioning a study of the area from Fulham Broadway town centre to Stamford Bridge and beyond. We particularly welcome the fact that “the study will also assess the feasibility of an expansion of the stadium within the existing historic site boundaries”. We note that the study specifically excludes “any design or details of a redevelopment on the stadium site” which presumably would wait until the study report has been published and decisions made.  As well as engaging stakeholders such as the local community and residents groups, which is clearly essential, we urge the club to actively involve Chelsea supporters in the study (and the implementation of the study results), which is clearly of significant importance to all Chelsea supporters.  We  will pass on to those conducting the study the comments and suggestions we have received from members of the local community following extensive door to door leafleting that we have carried out in the area over the last year, as well as ideas we have been given with regard to Brompton Cemetery. The CST are keen to work with the various parties involved in the study, as the stadium issue is of fundamental interest to our members, as was made clear in the 2013 CST Members Survey.

"By . Paul Bentley . It is not the first time a war of words has broken out involving The Archers. This time, however, the row is not being played out by the drama’s characters – but among its famously dedicated fans. For decades residents of Inkberrow, Worcestershire, have claimed that Ambridge, where The Archers is set, is based on their village. Tradition: It has long been thought that The Old Bull pub in Inkberrow is the inspiration for the pub in The Archers . Not only did the soap opera’s creator live nearby, but the BBC has been so convinced of Inkberrow’s claim that it uses its landmarks for publicity shots for the Radio 4 show. But this week a historian from the other side of the Midlands has started a campaign to convince fans that the soap is, in fact, modelled on his village of Rippingale in Lincolnshire. Jim Latham believes he has conclusive proof that Godfrey Baseley, who created The Archers, meant for Ambridge to resemble Rippingale. He argues that Inkberrow was chosen for publicity pictures simply because it is close to BBC Birmingham, where the show is recorded. Not willing to give up their title without a fight, Inkberrow’s community leaders have dismissed their rival village’s claim as ‘bonkers’. Both, in particular, assert that their local ale house is the inspiration for the Bull pub in the soap. Mr Latham claims the original idea for the series came from Rippingale farmer Henry Burtt who met Mr Baseley in 1946 while he was producing a show called Farm Visit. Two years later Mr Burtt was invited to a BBC conference in Birmingham where he allegedly said it should commission a farming version of Dick Barton, the special agent serial. Mr Latham claims Mr Baseley was so taken . with the idea he travelled back to Rippingale to have a proper tour, . and would have visited the local pub – The Bull Inn. Claims: It has now been claimed that Godfrey Baseley, who created The Archers, pictured, meant for Ambridge to resemble Rippingale . ‘It does not take any stretch of the imagination to picture them in the Bull in Rippingale talking over their ideas,’ said Mr Latham. ‘He began designing and building the Archers family and Ambridge from that moment.’ For their part, Inkberrow residents point to an investigation by Countryfile Magazine two years ago which found that Ambridge’s Bull pub was based on Inkberrow’s Old Bull and the fictional Brookfield farm was inspired by Summerhill Farm run by Mr Baseley’s sister-in-law in nearby Hanbury. Hedli Niklaus of The Archers Addicts fan club said the rural setting was ‘left to the imagination’ of listeners, but added: ‘I think Godfrey would say it’s set in the West Midlands.’","Inkberrow has long claimed that Ambridge is .

"By . Anna Edwards . A dangerous driver who led police on a 90mph chase through winding country lanes was finally caught after he crashed into a school bus. James Poole, 20, raced through streets, dodged oncoming traffic and forced other drivers to swerve out of his way. He jumped red lights and sped along the wrong side of the road in a bid to shake off police officers who were pursuing him, a court heard. A dangerous driver who led police on a 90mph chase was finally caught - after he crashed into a school bus . But he was finally caught after he tried to squeeze between a school bus stopped at traffic lights and an oncoming lorry and hit the bus. A judge jailed Poole for 22 months and handed him a three-year driving ban. Prosecutor Edward Phillips told Southampton Crown Court in Southampton, Hants, officers in a patrol car captured the chase on film. PC Mark Bailey was driving an unmarked police car southbound on the M3 near Winchester, Hampshire, and spotted a grey BMW undertaking another car. Video footage played to the court showed Poole then returning to the outside lane before undercutting other vehicles. Poole, 20, raced through streets, dodged oncoming traffic and forced other drivers to swerve out of his way . The officer then turned on his blue lights and sirens, but Poole ignored it and carried on, accelerating to reach speeds of up to 90mph. He then careered off the motorway at Winchester and hurtled down a B road. Officers kept up a running commentary to the police control room as Poole made no attempt to slow down but continued to overtake vehicles at speed. At one point, he crossed double white lines on a blind bend and also jumped village traffic lights at 60mph. Poole, who had passengers in the BMW, ignored 'keep left' bollards and forced oncoming motorists to pull over to avoid a crash, the court heard. But the pursuit ended when he tried to squeeze between stationary cars and oncoming traffic at a junction and crashed into a school bus. An officer turned on his blue lights and sirens, but Poole ignored it and carried on, accelerating to reach speeds of up to 90mph . His passengers ran off but Poole, of no fixed abode, was arrested sitting in the driver’s seat. He admitted using a vehicle without insurance, driving a vehicle without a licence, two counts of theft, and one count of dangerous driving. Recorder Nigel Lickley QC, sentencing, said Poole showed a complete disregard for the safety of other drivers and his passengers. Mr Lickley said: 'This case clearly crosses the custody threshold and a suspended sentence is not appropriate. 'You were very fortunate nobody was seriously injured.' Nichola Attwood, mitigating, said Poole had reached a crossroads in his life and realised he had to change his ways.","James Poole, 20, raced through streets while being chased by police .

"By . Mark Gleeson . The presidents of Cameroon and Ghana have ordered official inquiries into the strife-riven performances of their respective teams at the World Cup where their campaigns were overshadowed by controversy over money and discipline. Cameroon's Paul Biya has asked his government to submit a report within one month into 'the causes of the inglorious campaign of our Indomitable Lions at the 2014 World Cup football'. Ghana's president John Mahama said he wanted a commission of inquiry to get to the bottom of his country's early exit. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Watch the Ghana squad warm up with synchronized dance . Money mattersCameroon players had a stand-off over finances before failing to win a game at the World Cup . Both countries' squads were embroiled in unseemly strikes over money in actions FIFA said must never happen again. Cameroon players delayed the departure of their expensively-hired charter jet to Brazil by almost 24 hours as they squeezed more money out of their federation while Ghana's government this week flew some $3-million in cash to Brazil to appease their striking players. 'We need to constitute a commission to shine the light on Ghana's World Cup campaign,' Mahama told reporters in Equatorial Guinea at a summit of African leaders, Ghanaian media reported. 'We have to see the whole process through to the end,"" he added, calling for an overhaul of the team. Finally arrived: The Cameroon squad touch down in Rio after refusing to fly over a payment dispute . Biya ordered his prime minister to submit a report within a month on their performance, which included one player head-butting another during a match in Manaus. 'The report must include proposals for a deep and urgent restructuring of Cameroonian football,' a statement from the Cameroon president's press secretary Ferdinand Ngoh Ngoh said. Cameroon press reports also said their Minister of Sport Adoum Garoua would face questions from concerned National Assembly members. A news conference promised by Cameroon Football Federation president Joseph Owona on arrival back in the central African country has yet to happen as both officials and players went to ground after returning to Yaounde from Brazil this week. Bad boys: Ghana's Sulley Muntari (L) and Kevin Prince-Boateng were sent home for disciplinary reasons . Cameroon lost all three group matches for a second successive tournament. Ghana finished bottom of their group with only a 2-2 draw with Germany hinting that they had been Africa's form team going into the World Cup.

"By . Dan Bloom . Dramatic footage has emerged of the moment a Chinese ship sparked a diplomatic stand-off by crashing into a much smaller Vietnamese fishing boat. The vessels were in disputed waters in the South China Sea - where China has erected a giant oil rig - when they collided last week, ramping up tensions between the two nations. Now Vietnam has released footage of the incident which it says proves the sinking was a deliberate act - but China still disagrees over what it shows. Scroll down for video . Dramatic: Vietnam has released this footage which it says shows the moment a Chinese ship sank a much smaller Vietnamese fishing vessel in a disputed part of the South China Sea. China denies being the aggressor . Evidence: The video was played to a press conference and further stokes tensions between the two countries . State television broadcast the dramatic video today and it was played to journalists in a press conference. Shot from a nearby Vietnamese craft, it . appears to show the Chinese ship steaming towards two smaller . Vietnamese vessels - leaving one of the fishing boats capsized in its . wake. At the moment of impact, one man on the boat from where the footage was filmed yells in Vietnamese: 'Oh! The boat's sinking.' 'Look, it rammed and sank it!' another shouts. Vietnamese . fishing boats nearby rescued the 10 fishermen from the sunken . vessel on May 26 - and Hanoi officials said the Chinese ship made no effort to help. A . new report on Vietnamese state network VTV said: 'The latest images . recorded by Vietnamese fishermen at the time when fishing ship DNa-90152 . was sunk by a Chinese ship serve as irrefutable evidence of the . inhumane actions of China against Vietnamese fishermen.' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei, meanwhile, said it was the Vietnamese ships that were being aggressive. Approach: The video appears to show the Chinese vessel (left) chasing the red Vietnamese boats (right) Catching up: The larger boat moves closer to the smaller red boats until it is just a few feet away . Controversy: The moment just before the impact, which left one of the fishing boats capsized in its wake . 'In these seas. China's ships were in a defensive mode,' he said. 'Who was it who took the initiative for the clash? Who was it who created tension on the scene? This is very clear.' Accounts of the incident from each country have been wildly disparate. Last . week, Hanoi officials said around 40 Chinese fishing boats had . surrounded the Vietnamese craft before one of them rammed it and it . sank. But China's official . Xinhua news agency, citing a government source, had said the vessel . capsized after 'harassing and colliding with' a Chinese fishing boat. Scores . of ships are still squaring up despite several collisions after the . platform was towed to the area last month, sparking anti-Chinese riots . in Vietnam in which at least four workers were killed. Remains: The fishermen who escaped from the boat were rescued by nearby vessels, according to Vietnam . Back to harbour: The Vietnamese boat, DNA 90152, was towed to the central coastal city of Danang . Damaged relations: The boat after it returned to port. The airing of the footage has stoked further tensions . Admiral Ngo Ngoc Thu, vice commander . of the Vietnam Coastguard, said today China had 'up to 140 ships' around the rig including 'six military vessels and many military . planes'. He claimed China has already damaged 24 Vietnamese ships. The rig, Haiyang Shiyou 981, is drilling between the Paracel islands occupied by China and the Vietnamese coast. Each country claims the waters as its own. Vietnam . said today the rig had moved position, but was still in its . 200-nautical mile exclusive economic zone and on its continental shelf.

An outraged Tennessee mother has held a 'nurse in' at a Knoxville Chick-Fil-A after a staff member told her to stop breastfeeding in the restaurant's playground because she was scaring other children. Knoxville mother-of-two, Jennifer Day, was feeding her five-month old daughter, Kahlyn, at the Turkey Creek fast food joint last weekend. When nearby customers complained, an employee of the restaurant, which caused controversy last year for its stance against gay marriage, approached Day and told her to stop breastfeeding in public or use a cover. Scroll down for video . Nurse in: A group of mothers turned up on Wednesday night to the Turkey Creek Chick-Fil-A to protest after Jennifer Day was told off for breastfeeding . 'An employee came up to me and told me some of the other parents were afraid of allowing their kids to play in the play area while I was feeding her, especially without any cover,' Day told NBC News. Tennessee law states mothers can breastfeed in any public place, so Day was appalled by the request and told the young employee she was allowed to continue breastfeeding. She said she doesn't use a cover because Kahlyn doesn't like it and always pulls it off. 'Any mother is allowed to breast feed her child if shes in that place otherwise,' she said. '(Breasts) were made for a purpose, a God-given ability. It's the best gift you can give to your child.' Outraged: Day, pictured, with baby daughter, Kahlyn, was told to stop breastfeeding by an employee last weekend . On Tuesday, Chick-Fil-A said the manager at the restaurant 'has apologized and regrets any offense he may have caused.' But Day and other mothers from the area staged a 'nurse in' at the Turkey Creek restaurant on Wednesday to protest the treatment. Anna Hurley, who helped organize the event, told ABC News 6 the 'nurse in' was about education. 'We want everyone to feel safe. We . want nursing mothers to feel safe because what is more family then a . mother and her baby and this is a family restaurant,' Hurley said. She added that it wasn't about punishing the restaurant. Chick-Fil-A: The incident happened at the restaurant in Turkey Creek, pictured, on the weekend . 'We just want to normalize breastfeeding. We just want society to change their views.' Chick-Fil-A also said it was sending employees for training with the East Tennessee Breastfeeding Coalition to help them better understand the law. By rights, a mother may breastfeed in any public or private place she is authorized to be. The law also states breastfeeding shall not be considered public indecency or nudity, obscene, or sexual conduct, that local governments shall not prohibit breastfeeding in public by local ordinance and that employers must accommodate breastfeeding mothers at work.","Knoxville mother-of-two, Jennifer Day, was feeding her five-month old daughter, Kahlyn, at the Turkey Creek fast food restaurant last weekend .

"By . Liz Hull . A convicted thug who conned an 87-year-old widow out of £15,000 in savings for building work he never did is serving just eight days in jail. Shaun Price and accomplice James Loveridge received credit for pleading guilty, despite being involved in a car chase to flee police and denying being the men who duped the pensioner when they were caught. Price, 22, who already had convictions for theft, criminal damage and harassment, will be freed tomorrow. Jailed: Shaun Price, left, and James Loveridge, right, will spend just eight days and two weeks in prison respectively after admitting involvement in a £14,600 scam. Their victim has been forced to leave her home . Loveridge, 18, who had a conviction for assault, will walk free next week after just a fortnight in jail. Last night, Mrs Wilson’s son Richard said the sentence was no deterrent because their crime was so lucrative. He added: ‘The fact they got more than £7,000 each for a few weeks in jail means it pays better than a job. I certainly don’t earn a wage that high, it pays better than any job I know.’ And campaigners said: ‘British justice has been put in the dock and found guilty of complete failure.’ Chester Crown Court heard that Price and Loveridge, who both live in caravan parks, targeted the grandmother last September, spending a week convincing her to pay for unnecessary roof repairs. They persuaded the retired teacher to go to her bank and withdraw £4,800, then returned the following day to collect a further £9,800 from her. But Mrs Wilson told her 49-year-old son about the visits and he immediately contacted police. He also called his mother’s bank to put a stop on the joint account he shared with her, so that when the conmen returned the following day for another £7,800, she was unable to withdraw it. Victim: Elspeth Wilson, left, has moved to a retirement home after the incident, according to son Richard, right . He said: ‘Mum thought I had sent some workers to do some jobs for her, but I didn’t know anything about it. ‘When I checked how much was missing from her account I couldn’t believe my eyes. They took thousands and just kept coming back for more each time.’ Police placed a secret camera in bushes at the front of Mrs Wilson’s home, which recorded Loveridge walking up the drive on September 27. Sentence: Judge Roger Dutton described the pair's crime as 'extremely offensive' and said they knew what they were doing was dishonest . Three days later officers were waiting in an unmarked car as he returned . to the property in upmarket Stockton Heath, Cheshire. When confronted, . he tried to escape in a van driven by Price, but they were caught after a . high-speed chase. Despite initial denials, they eventually admitted fraud by dishonestly making false representation for their own gain. Loveridge, . of Elton, Cheshire, and Price, of Widnes, were sentenced to four months . in jail on January 23, but were only locked up for a few days each . because their guilty pleas and the fact that both had to wear electronic . tags while awaiting trial were taken into account. The money they stole amounted to  half the insurance payout  Mrs Wilson received when her husband Peter died aged 84 last year. Her . son said: ‘When the police searched the homes of the two men, they . couldn’t find any trace of the money. She won’t see a penny of that ever . again.’ Mr Wilson added that although their punishment was . short-lived, the ordeal would affect his independent mother for the rest . of her life. After she was duped, he was so fearful that she might . be exploited again that he  moved her out of her home of almost 40 years . and into a retirement complex where she felt more protected. Yesterday, the electronics engineer criticised the courts for failing to punish or deter the cruel conmen. He said: ‘I was shaking when I found out. Four months seems like a kick in the teeth. It doesn’t feel like a real punishment. ‘They did this to an old person who has worked for the benefit of society as a teacher the whole of her working life.’ Paul . Green, a spokesman for Saga, the organisation for the over-50s, said: . ‘Eight days is an insult – eight years would have been much more . appropriate. ‘The perpetrators clearly have no shame, but British . justice has been put in the dock as well and found guilty of complete . failure.’ Mrs Wilson’s MP, David Mowat, said: ‘This appears derisory. Given that this man already had a criminal record, it is a completely . inadequate sentence and a failure of the justice system.’ The Tory MP . said he would be raising the case with Justice Secretary Chris . Grayling, who has vowed to ‘teach criminals that they will be punished . for their crime’. Despite a Coalition pledge to end so-called soft . sentences, new figures show barely a quarter of all criminals convicted . of serious offences were jailed in 2012. More than 700 arsonists, 70 . rapists, 1,100 people convicted of sex assaults, 2,745 fraudsters, 162 . who killed by reckless driving and 77 kidnappers were among those who . walked from court that year.","Fraudsters convinced retired teacher Elspeth Wilson to hand over £14,600 for 'building work' on her home in Cheshire .

"By . Sam Greenhill . Accuser: Jance Hancock, pictured in the 1970s, alleged that Travis had indecently assaulted her . The woman whose indecent assault claims dating back to the 1970s triggered the prosecution of Dave Lee Travis said last night she was ‘not bitter’ about the verdict, but hoped it would not ‘wreck’ Operation Yewtree. Jane Hancock, 54, said she was in ‘shock’ at the trial’s outcome – but said she was thankful it had given a ‘voice’ to her and the other women who accused the DJ of molesting them. Even though the jury rejected her account and found Travis not guilty, she told the Daily Mail: ‘I am disappointed and I am shocked, but I don’t feel hard done by or sour grapes. I’m not bitter. ‘I’m glad I did what I did and I respect the jury’s decision. I just hope the police continue to take women’s claims seriously and I hope other people aren’t put off coming forward. ‘I feel, please God, let Yewtree continue with the same vigour. They must not think that they have failed.’ Last night she said giving evidence had been tough but that she would go through it again, even though Travis had been cleared. ‘It was one of the hardest things I  have ever done, but if I had to go through all of this again, I would. I really would,’ she said. ‘Historical cases are always difficult for jurors. We knew that. They have a difficult job. The verdicts are a shock. ‘I’m just blown away really.

Miss Hancock also expressed her sympathy for Travis’s other accusers, saying: ‘I’m gutted for all of the girls. They must all be feeling terrible. But they should all know that what we did was very brave. ‘The original fear, at the start of all this, was simply that I wouldn’t be believed. I totally respect the jury’s decision and it clearly wasn’t an easy one for them. ‘Nothing changes the way I feel about what happened all those years ago.’ She added: ‘I don’t feel let down by the police, not at all. They have worked very hard and they have given us a voice. I think that’s the most important thing of all, even if the verdict is disappointing. ‘It is just nice to know that we are being listened to, even if in court it is impossible to prove so that the jury can totally believe. But, no, I praise Operation Yewtree.’ It was Miss Hancock’s claims that triggered the police investigation into Travis. She was a 17-year-old archivist working at BBC Broadcasting House in London when she met the DJ in the 1970s. She told the jury he had given her lifts in his famous ‘big yellow banana’, a Pontiac Firebird Trans car, but had assaulted her in a  BBC studio in 1977 while he was live on Radio 1. Claims: The accusations had related mainly to Travis's time as a BBC DJ in the 1970s and 1980s . Historic cases: Travis was prosecuted as a result of Operation Yewtree, launched in 2012 after Jimmy Savile was exposed as a predatory peadophile. Travis is pictured here on Top of the Pops with Savile . She accused him of switching off the studio light and putting on a ‘smoochy’ song, before grabbing her tightly to dance. Claiming he was aroused, Miss Hancock said: ‘I was horrified. I didn’t know what it was. It sounds stupid but I was still a virgin.’ He pinned her against the wall and thrust his fingers into her underwear, she alleged. But the jury rejected her claims and cleared Travis of indecently assaulting her. In a separate interview she told ITV News that there should not  be a ‘sell-by date’ on complaints, adding: ‘I worry that the verdict will prevent other people from coming forward. ‘It’s tough enough anyway and the precedent is still to be made, in so much that it will put people off in coming forward with complaints about abuse that they’ve received – whether it be last week or 30 years ago. But my message to anybody who is listening is please don’t be put off. ‘Although it’s tough to go through the trial, and to be in court and to be cross-examined, you’ve done something valuable. ‘It’s quite scary what they will drag up from your own past in order to cast doubt in the jury’s minds. But having said that, I would still happily do it again. ‘I think that there has to be some kind of understanding that in an historical abuse claim, some of the witnesses will have forgotten, some of them will be dead. 'The fact that you didn’t complain at the time implies that there is a sell-by date, if you like, on a complaint.’ Miss Hancock, of Surrey, decided to waive her legal right to anonymity in return for a donation to the charity Victim Support. She has never asked for any payment for herself. Relief: Travis, shown in a court sketch expressing his relief at the not guilty verdicts, told the jury: 'It's their word against mine' She added that she saw no reason to ‘hide’ and that she wanted to give encouragement to women in other cases. In October 2012, at the height of the revelations about Jimmy Savile, Miss Hancock phoned the then BBC director-general George Entwistle to report her accusations about Travis, but said his office dismissively told her: ‘We are not taking calls of this nature.’ She told the jury at Travis’s trial: ‘I felt like the BBC had slammed the door in my face.’ Miss Hancock added: ‘The BBC did not want to know when I complained in 2012, whereas the police took my complaint seriously from the start.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Jance Hancock, 54, said that Dave Lee Travis assaulted her in 1970s .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A set of slides purporting to show UFOs are part of the latest batch of government documents leaked by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. The slides belong to a Powerpoint presentation created by the British spy agency GCHQ (Government Communications Headquarters). Three of the slides depict alien spaceships, but they’ve been dismissed by one UFO expert as fakes. ‘The presentation features three UFO pictures, on slides 35 to 37,’ Nigel Watson, author of Haynes UFO Investigations Manual, told Yahoo News. Is this August 2011 photo by a holidaymaker in Cornwall, UK, proof of UFOs or simply an out-of-focus seagull taking a poo, as Nigel Watson claims . ‘The first is a black and white picture of a UFO over Redbud, Illinois, taken on 23 April 1950, the second a screenshot of a UFO video by Arturo Robles Gil filmed in Mexico and the third was taken on 01 August 2011 by a holidaymaker at Black Head, Trenarren near St. Austell, Cornwall. 'They have been explained respectively by skeptics as a hub cap thrown in the air, a deflated Mylar balloon and an out-of-focus seagull taking a poo.’ In fact Watson believes the document is really proof of government attempts at mind control and the slides are part of guidelines for spies on how to spread misinformation via the internet. ‘The main evidence for the cover-up of UFO reports and manipulation of UFO beliefs, as revealed by the documents released by Edward Snowden, is contained in a Powerpoint presentation called, The Art Of Deception: Training For A New Generation Of Online Covert Operations. Fake: The images, leaked by Edward Snowden, right,  have been rubbished by Nigel Watson, author of Haynes UFO Investigations Manual, left, who says skeptics have already dismissed the images as fake . Watson claims this screenshot of a UFO video by Arturo Robles Gil filmed in Mexico really shows a deflated Mylar balloon . ‘This was produced by the GCHQ (Government Communications Headquarters), British secret intelligence agency and features fifty slides related to using the internet for psychological operations (psy-ops). 'It was produced by a unit called the Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group (JTRIG) for presentations to the US, National Security Agency (NSA) and other agencies.’ Watson believes that governments know that supposed UFOs can be used to control the minds of citizens, so the fact that Snowden leaked these slides could be a big blow to the agencies that use the presentation to train spies. ‘Government agencies are still aware of the power of the belief in UFOs, and that they are willing to use the internet to exploit these beliefs,’ said Watson. This slide shows a black and white picture of a UFO over Redbud, Illinois, taken on 23 April 1950, but skeptics believe it is of a hub cap thrown in the air . ‘Such deception can be used as a . means of covering-up more mundane terrestrial activities (like the . testing of secret aircraft or military exercises) or to undermine the . credibility of ufologists. ‘The . overall point of the presentation is to discuss how the internet and . modern media can be used to discredit people and to spread deception. 'Unfortunately, there is no explanatory text with the UFO pictures, so we . can only speculate about what point they were being used to make.’","The latest official document to be linked by Edward Snowden is a presentation created by the British spy agency GCHQ .

Tragic: The bodies of Eoghan Chada, 10 (right) and his brother Ruairi, five, (left) were found in the boot of their father Sanjeev Chada's (centre) car after he crashed into a wall in County Mayo, Ireland, yesterday . Two brothers were found dead in the boot of their father’s crashed car yesterday after their mother reported them missing. Nurse Kathleen Chada trained in London before moving to Ireland with her husband Sanjeev, 43. Mr Chada, who was believed to have been under investigation for fraud, was meant to be taking sons Eoghan, ten, and Ruairi, five, to a bowling alley on Sunday evening. But when he failed to return home, his wife Kathleen contacted police and raised the alarm. Yesterday Mr Chada’s Ford Focus was found after it crashed into a stone wall near Westport, County Mayo – more than 170 miles from the family’s home in County Carlow. The boys’ bodies were found in the boot of the vehicle and Mr Chada – who suffered non-life threatening injuries in the crash – was cut free from the car and taken to Mayo General Hospital. Post-mortem examinations were due to be carried out yesterday, but police sources said the boys were thought to have been strangled or suffocated. Mrs Chada qualified as a nurse in Kingston, south west London, where the couple are believed to have met. Police initially said they had no knowledge of any breakdown in the family and insisted the couple were not estranged. However shortly after driving away with the boys, Mr Chada called a family member and left what was described as a ‘very distressed message’. And a police source suggested Mr Chada, who ran a computer business from home, had been linked to the disappearance of £50,000 from his local community centre. They said: ‘Mr Chada was on a committee which had raised significant funds in relation to the building of an extension at the community centre, but enquiries at a local bank branch showed the cash had gone missing. ‘An investigation was under way into an alleged fraud but it had only just started.’ Father Declan Foley, a friend of the family, said the news of the boys’ deaths had hit Mrs Chada ‘like an earthquake’. Investigation: A post mortem examination into the deaths of Eoghan, 10, and Ruairi, five, (pictured left) is to be carried out today. The pair had disappeared with the father Sanjeev after he told wife Kathleen (right) that he was taking the children out . Police probe: Gardai stand guard at the family home where Mr Chada, Eoghan and Ruairi went missing from on Sunday . ‘It was devastating for all of us,’ he . said. ‘You cannot put into words the shock and the pain and the . numbness and the grief of that news coming through that her two boys had . died.’ The priest said the brothers were ‘lovely little lads’ and were Mrs Chada’s ‘pride and joy’. And headmistress Michelle Doorley from . Ballinkillen National School, where the boys were pupils, said the pair . were ‘very close’. Looking for clues: Garda stand guard at the scene of the crash yesterday as Mr Chada's Ford Focus sits covered by a forensic tent . Evidence: Detectives take the Ford Focus in which the two boys' bodies were found for further investigation . Sanjeev Chada, 43, (right) was injured in the crash but police found the bodies of his two children Eoghan, ten (left) and Ruairi, five, (centre), in the car boot . ‘Ruairi was like Eoghan’s shadow,’ she . said. ‘They were very clever, bright, took part in everything. They . were very popular chaps, great sense of fun, great sense of humour. ‘They were just two super boys. Lovely . characters. They had the whole package.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Summoning the willpower to stick to a punishing diet and exercise regime is never easy but one woman has found a novel solution. Lynne Seymour, 46, from Southampton lost an incredible eight stone after a course of hypnotherapy gave her the motivation she needed to overcome her food cravings. Mrs Seymour's battle with her weight began as a child but when the NHS ward manager hit 16st, she decided enough was enough. Looking good: Mrs Seymour has lost half of her bodyweight - an impressive 8st - after a hypnotherapy course . 'I have struggled with my weight my entire life,' explained Mrs Seymour. 'I have always tried the latest fad diets, gone to slimming clubs and I even took diet pills to try and lose weight.' But despite her efforts and her ability to lose weight easily, Mrs Seymour says keeping the pounds off permanently proved a challenge. 'I would lose as much as seven stone quite easily, it would drop off me, but I would always put it straight back on,' she explains. 'I felt a bit like a football - I couldn’t move well at all and I used to just plod around like an old lady. It got to the point where I knew I couldn’t stay as big as I was and that I needed to lose weight. 'I was weighing up my options and thinking about paying to have gastric band surgery. But my mum saw a TV programme on hypnotherapy and I decided to give it a go.' Transformation: At 16st (left) Mrs Seymour suffered breathlessness. Now (right) that is a thing of the past . Problem: Mrs Seymour's weight problems began as a child and she tried numerous fad diets to shift it . Her sessions at the Hampshire Hypnotherapy Centre proved to be exactly what she needed and Mrs Seymour, who was struggling with breathlessness and osteoarthritis caused by her weight, hasn't looked back since. Determined to beat the bulge, the mother-of-one signed on to the centre’s Easyloss programme and quickly began to see results. Just one year after starting the programme, Mrs Seymour has lost half her bodyweight - and this time, has managed to keep the pounds at bay. 'I have never felt like I was on a diet,' she explains. 'It was just so easy. The weight just fell off me and it felt completely effortless. I just never thought it would be possible. 'I eat things that I would never have touched before, like fruit - now all I ever snack on is fruit. I’m a lot fitter too, I still have aches and pains but I am more healthy and I have been surprised at how much energy I have now. Confident: Mrs Seymour's newly svelte figure has given her a new lease of life and she is much happier . 'I can walk my dog which I couldn’t do before. People have been amazed by my transformation, they didn’t recognise me at first which was lovely. 'I still eat, I’m not deprived. I eat what I want, and leave what I don’t. I have just changed the way I eat and the foods I eat.' She added: 'Now I don’t even bother weighing myself. If my clothes fit and I feel good, why should I have to get on the scales. As long as you feel good and healthy, the numbers don’t matter.' Speaking about Mrs Seymour's dramatic transformation, Sue Peckham, director at Hampshire Hypnotherapy Centre, commented: 'Our Easyloss programme is really effective because it is not a diet but a way of getting back to eating like a naturally slim person. 'The most common thing my clients say to me when they first start to see such amazing results is ""I can’t believe how easy this is"".' A delighted Mrs Seymour added: 'I’ve never looked back since and I have kept the weight off. I haven’t struggled at all.'","Lynne Seymour, 46, from Southampton lost 8st after having hypnotherapy .

Their documents were checked – three times – but they were still allowed to board the wrong Ryanair flight. Instead of a sunshine break to Almeria, they were set to go to Riga, 1,850 miles away. One of the . passengers, Stephen Pritchard, told how he and his son Jake Kelly, 14, . were even shown to their seats by a stewardess. Fed-up: Stephen Pritchard and his son Jake Kelly (left), 14, and Jo Housley and her baby daughter Erin and sons Charlie and Jordan, stranded at Birmingham Airport after Ryanair allowed them onto the wrong flight . Arduous: The two families endured a longer-than anticipated journey to their holiday destination . The crew realised the error only when the correct occupants of the seats arrived. Spain-bound holidaymaker Jo Housley, 29, was also seated on the wrong plane with her baby and two children. By then, it was too late for the families, who do not know each other, to catch their correct flight on Monday. They . decided to share a £70 taxi to Birmingham Airport 37 miles away, where . they were booked  on the next available Ryanair flight to Spain. They . did not have to pay extra for the plane later that day but it took them . to Murcia, 107 miles and a £130 taxi ride from Almeria. Mr . Pritchard, a painter and decorator from Cannock, Staffordshire, said . his boarding pass was checked at the gate, on the airfield and on the . plane but he was still able to get on the wrong flight. ‘I could have been a terrorist or anything,’ he said. ‘They are  supposed to be tightening security. It’s unbelievable.’ The confusion began when two queues formed close together at adjacent gates for the flights to Almeria and Riga. Miss . Housley, 29, from Rotherham, was travelling with her four-month-old . baby Erin and sons Jordan, 10 and Charlie, seven, to visit a relative in . Spain. The full-time mother declined to comment.

"By . Hugo Gye . Claims: Conservative councillor John Morgan is alleged to have stolen the life savings of Beryl Gittens, who suffered from Alzheimer's disease . A district councillor squandered £154,000 belonging to an elderly woman by gambling it on slot machines, leaving her penniless when she died, a court heard today. John Morgan was given power of attorney over the finances of Beryl Gittens, 92, who was always dressed well and wore expensive jewellery. But he allegedly spent nearly all her money on fruit machines and a gambling trip to Las Vegas, so that when she died she had to be given a 'pauper's funeral'. Morgan, 75, has been a Conservative councillor for more than 25 years, and currently serves on Vale of White Horse District Council in Oxfordshire. He has admitted spending Mrs Gittens' money - but told police she asked him to gamble it in order to stop her relatives arguing over their inheritance. The councillor was a trusted friend of Mrs Gittens, a widow, for a number of years and had been granted power of attorney, along with her son Roger Gittens, after she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2004. Michael Roques QC, prosecuting, told Oxford Crown Court that Morgan had stolen nearly £80,000 in cash and £75,000 through transfers into his bank account. 'There were a number of cash withdrawals, including some in Las Vegas while the defendant was on holiday there,' he said. 'A number of withdrawals were made at motorway service stations and it transpires that these have £500 jackpot fruit machines at them. 'There was money going on casino slot machines and it became apparent that Morgan was using Beryl Gittens' money for gambling.' The court heard that Mrs Gittens and her late husband Bill had owned a pub in Hermitage, Berkshire, where Morgan was a regular, leading to him becoming a close friend of the pensioner. She wrote a will in 2004 that granted Morgan and Roger Gittens, who lives in Australia, power of attorney and specified that Morgan would get £5,000 from her estate as thanks for his friendship. In September of that year Mrs Gittens moved into a care home in Wantage, Oxfordshire on the advice of doctors. It is alleged Morgan began siphoning money from her account six months later. With her husband's Army pension, a State pension, life savings and £137,500 from the sale of her flat, the estate was originally worth nearly £250,000, the court heard. But by the time she was moved to the Hungerford Care Home in January 2011, she had so little money left that the council had to pay her bill. Trial: Morgan has denied theft during a hearing at Oxford Crown Court, pictured . Council workers became suspicious after Morgan repeatedly wrote cheques on Mrs Gittens' behalf which subsequently bounced, the court heard. When the elderly woman died in January 2012 almost all of her money had been stolen, Mr Roques said. 'By the time she died there was no money for a funeral,' he continued. 'The defendant had had £154,000 of her money and rather than pay for the funeral himself he went to the council and asked it to pay for her funeral. It did, as the accounts said she had no money.' Family members who attended Mrs Gittens' funeral were surprised at the simple ceremony because she had 'dressed immaculately and had nice jewellery', the court heard. Her sister-in-law became suspicious and contacted Roger Gittens, who examined his mother's accounts and then contacted police about the alleged embezzlement of her funds. The court heard Morgan had told police in interview that Mrs Gittens had been very careful with money but been generous to her son in Australia. 'This defendant accepts he took £154,000 of her money,' Mr Roques said, adding that Morgan denied acting dishonestly and claimed Mrs Gittens had wanted to keep her money out of the hands of her in-laws. 'He said one day there was a conversation between just the two of them. She said, ""I want you to promise me that when I go there is but a penny for those buggers to squabble over.""' 'When asked, he said he made sure that all the money was taken out of the account, according to her wishes. He said she would have loved a visit but no family bothered. That is why they didn't deserve any money.' Morgan, from Wantage, also told police that Mrs Gittens liked to gamble on fruit machines, but said that her family was unaware of her habit. He has been a member of the Vale of White Horse District Council since 2007, having previously spent 21 years serving on Newbury and West Berkshire councils. After he was charged with theft, he stepped down as vice-chairman of the council's planning committee, but has continued as a councillor. He denies the charge, and his trial is expected to last a week.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . If you think it’s been hot here, spare a thought for these tiger cubs. The pair were captured on camera cooling off in water as temperatures in Rajasthan, India, soared to 44C. Their mother, a Bengal tiger named Noor, had given birth to the cubs only three months before. She kept them sheltered in a cave at Ranthambore National Park until the heat became too much and she walked them down to a shallow pond to cool off. Wildlife photographer Andy Rouse, from Wales, said he and his friends were the first people to see the cubs. Mr Rouse said: ‘We were driving around and saw her in the road. Then we saw she had her cubs with her — one was running around, so she picked it up in her mouth and walked the cubs down to the water to cool off.

Mohareb, a senior member of the Football Association’s referee department and a football league official, was due to take charge of Barnsley against Peterborough on Tuesday night. But the 29-year-old was stood down from the match following his arrest at home on Sunday. Referee Dean Mohareb has been charged with perverting the course of justice and unauthorised access to computer data . Mohareb was first arrested over allegations that he hacked into a colleague's email account in October last year. Police seized a number of electrical items from his home on that occasion. Mohareb was suspended by the FA in February. It is understood that the other two men are not FA employees. The FA has declined to comment on the matter while legal proceedings are going on.

"By . Mia De Graaf . They are known as some of the wildest predators in the animal kingdom. But you wouldn't think it watching this video. In a bizarre clip that is both heart-warming and strange, five grey wolves kiss and cuddle a photographer - who is happy to join the pile of love. Scroll down for video . Warm embrace: Photographer Monty Sloan kisses a giant grey wolf as he rolls around on the floor . The pack at Indiana's Wolf Park abandon their predatory reputation in favour of a cuddle with the willing man . The pack starts by circling each other and wild life photographer Monty Sloan on a lake-side green at the Wolf Park in Battle Ground, Indiana. Mr Sloan is poised to take a picture but it seems he cannot resist returning the sharp-fanged animals' affection. Alarmingly, in the Park's description . of the pack, they explain that they are 'very friendly' to their prey - . but sources insist this was a moment of genuine affection. 'Wolves . do not growl or snarl at their prey,' the guide explains, 'It would be . like a human getting angry at an ice cream cone he or she was about to . eat! Wolves who are hunting look very excited and happy, even . “friendly”.' Intrigued: The animals circle Mr Sloan, climbing over each other. Instead of taking a photo he strokes them . Affectionate: Standing on the lake-side green, he ruffles their furry coats as they get more excitable . Still snapping: Inching back, Mr Sloan tries to capture the moment at Wolf Park in Battle Ground, Indiana . But the group catches him as he walks round and they tumble to the floor, licking and cuddling each other . And the doting photographer grapples to cling on to his long lens camera whilst cuddling the friendly greys . According to DNA studies, the domestic dog and the grey wolf is almost identical. But their marginally different brain development speed is the thing that sets them apart. Wolves . start to mature about two weeks earlier than their notoriously friendly . cousins - meaning they are quick to judge and make enemies. As a result, they are far from ideal pets. Domestic dogs are said to originate from wolf cubs that were used as guards by humans over 40,000 years ago in southeast Asia. Since that time wolves have been domesticated and used have been used by humans for hunting and herding. There are around 400 modern breeds of domesticated dogs. But tumbling around on the floor, these animals show no sign of cunning. They climb on each other to lick his face and nuzzle his head. Incredibly, the fearless animal lover kisses them back. Eventually the group roll onto the floor, where the snuggling continues. Mr Sloan juggles the excitable hounds with his camera as he flounders underneath the doting pile. The scenes completely contradict normal behaviour for the carnivorous breed, which feeds off mammals. Unlike their cousins - dogs - these animals are instinctively wild, with a strict code of conduct based on hierarchy within their pack. There is one line of rank for males and one for females. The alpha male and female lead their packs. Second in command is the beta male or female. At the bottom is the omega wolf - a scapegoat. Although there are leaders and weaklings, it is not always survival of the fittest. It is always the hungriest that gets to eat first, not necessarily the biggest. Working together, they ensure each member has a role to play and none are neglected. Contrary to popular belief, wild wolves are not dangerous. Naturally afraid of humans, they scarper in an instant, making them 'safe'. However, domesticated wolves and hybrid breeds are notoriously violent as they have lost their fear.","Photographer Monty Sloan abandons taking pictures to join the cuddling .
Unusual treatment of a human by pack in Wolf Park, Battle Ground, Indiana ."
"By . Sarah Griffiths . Many dog owners claim to love and look after their animals like a child. And now scientists have shown the age old bond between dogs and their owners is much closer to that of parent and child than previously thought. Domestic dogs have been closely associated with humans for about 15,000 years and canines are so well adapted to living with human beings that in many cases the owner assumes the role of the dog's main social partner, according to a new study. Scientists have shown the age old bond between dogs and their owners is much closer to that of parent and child than previously thought . A recent study claims young adults who care for an animal have stronger social relationships. U.S. scientists also found that looking after a pet might also boost teenagers’ connections to their communities as well. The study by psychologists at the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University, Massachusetts, found that people aged between 18 and 26 who had strong attachments to pets, reported feeling more connected to their communities and relationships. The study found that young adults who cared for animals reported engaging in more ‘contribution’ activities, such as providing service to their community, helping friends or family and demonstrating leadership, than those who did not look after a pet. The more actively they participated in the pet’s care, the higher they scored on their sociable deeds. Austrian researchers said the . relationship between pet owners and their dogs is very similar to the . deep connection between young children and their parents. They examined the ‘secure base effect’, which is a key element in child/parent bonding that had not examined between dog owners and their pets. The effect is when human infants use their caregivers as a secure base when it comes to interacting with the environment. Dr Lisa Horn from the Vetmeduni's Messerli Research Institute, which is part of the University of Veterinary Medicine, in Vienna, examined dogs' reactions under three conditions - when their owner was absent, silent and encouraging. The dogs could earn a food reward, by manipulating dog toys, according to the study, which was published in the journal PLoS One. The animals seemed much less keen on working for food when their caregivers were not there than when they were. Whether an owner encouraged the dog during the task or remained silent had little influence on the animal's level of motivation. In a follow-up experiment, Dr Horn and her colleagues replaced the owner with an unfamiliar person. Scientists examined the 'secure base effect' - when human infants use their caregivers as a secure base when it comes to interacting with the environment - and found the presence of an owner makes dogs more confident . The scientists found that dogs barely interacted with the strangers and were not much more interested in trying to get the food reward than when they were alone. They were only more motivated than when their owner was present. The researchers concluded that the owner's presence is important for the animal to behave in a confident manner. ‘The study provides the first evidence for the similarity between the “secure base effect” found in dog/owner and child/caregiver relationships,’ Dr Horn said. ‘This striking parallel will be further investigated in direct comparative studies on dogs and children.’ She added: ‘One of the things that really surprised us is that adult dogs behave towards their caregivers like human children do.’ ‘It will be really interesting to try to find out how this behaviour evolved in the dogs with direct comparisons.’","Dog owners assume the role of the canine's main social partner .

"By . Jaya Narain . and Tom Kelly . For seven days they evaded capture in the Caribbean while running up thousands of pounds on credit cards ‘living like there was no tomorrow’. But yesterday the two boarding school runaways were finally tracked down – and had to face a furious mother. Sixth-formers Edward Bunyan, 16, and Indira Gainiyeva, who turned 17 during their jaunt, had sparked an international manhunt after sneaking out of their £30,000-a-year boarding school last Monday and boarding a flight to the Dominican Republic. End of the party: Suzannah Bunyan looked stern as she ushered son Eddy Bunyan, 16, into a car to go home . They originally checked into a . five-star hotel on the island where they are believed to have spent . several days enjoying lavish meals and cocktails. But, . fearing the authorities were closing in, they moved to a rundown . £75-a-week apartment block where they hoped to remain under the radar. They were finally caught late on Sunday when plain clothes police found . them sitting at a beachside restaurant in the resort of Punta Cana. They told police: ‘We’re having a great time and want to stay.’ Ramon . Brito, spokesman for the local tourist police, said: ‘We located them . by tracing their credit cards. They spent Sunday night at the Sol Caribe . apartments, in the Los Corales resort in Bavaro. We confirmed that they . were there, contacted their parents, and the police went in to take . them to be reunited with their families. ‘The . hotel owners won’t face any procedures – the youngsters came for a good . time and behaved well, so there was never any danger to them or . others.’ The pair were later reunited with Edward’s mother, Susannah Bunyan, who had flown out to help the search. Yesterday . morning she frogmarched the sheepish couple from their bolthole to a . taxi and reluctantly returned them to the luxury hotel where she had . checked in. She later accompanied them for a meeting at the police . station flanked by motorcycle outriders. The pair have been on a week-long escapade, fleeing officials as they hop from one five-star resort to the next. Ms Bunyan carried the luggage as a sullen-looking Indira Gainiyeva, 17, stood behind waiting to get into the car . Action: The couple, who have been dating for seven months, face police questioning back in the UK . A source said: ‘Edward’s mother is very, very angry but also hugely relieved and wants to know what got into the pair. ‘She . desperately wants to know whether her son has been unhappy at boarding . school and whether he really wants to go back there. But she is also . very angry at what they did. We understand this stunt cost thousands of . pounds which he racked up on his credit card. It was like he was living . like there was no tomorrow.’ Their . adventure began last Monday when they left Stonyhurst College in . Clitheroe, Lancashire, at 3am and took a taxi to Manchester airport for a . flight to the Caribbean. On the run: The couple were believed to be staying in a room similar to this one when they were found . They spent the week jumping from one five-star hotel to another until police traced their credit card payments . After . British police alerted Interpol, local officers spent days scouring 250 . miles of coastline packed with resorts. They finally traced them via . their credit cards at the luxury Occidental Grand Hotel in Punta Cana, . which boasts three swimming pools, a spa, tennis courts, nine . restaurants, seven bars and live nightly shows. But . by the time officers arrived on Sunday they had moved half a mile away . to a one-bedroomed apartment in a shabby block a ten-minute walk from . the beach. They were also more frugal, stocking up on bread and water and dining at cheap beachside restaurants. The pair were traced to the Sol Carib apartment complex in Punta Cana on the island . Indira's oil-rich family refused to fly out to the resort as they had no way of tracing the so-called 'Bonnie and Clyde' Fellow pupils took to Twitter to try to trace their whereabouts as the couple turned off their mobile phones . This is the beach front bar area where the couple were found on Sunday night before Eddy's mother arrived . The Roman Catholic school has refused to reveal what action will be taken over their escapade . At . around 11pm on Sunday police moved in and picked them up. It is . understood that they are now in separate rooms at the Occidental and . that Mrs Bunyan will act as guardian to Indira for the journey back to . Britain later this week. Indira’s . father, Ravil Gainiyev, a businessman in Kazakhstan, said: ‘Everything . is under control. We now want to take Indira home, back to Kazakhstan.’ It is understood that he and Indira’s mother Firuza spoke to their . daughter by phone after she was found, but they declined to talk about . the call. Eddy Bunyan was described by friends as 'a bit of a rebel'. Indira's parents believe she fell in love with him . Stonyhurst College in Lancashire prides itself on its high-end security measures . Stonyhurst headmaster Andrew Johnson said staff were delighted . the pair had been found safe and well but would not be drawn on whether . they would be expelled. The . college had earlier defended its security measures, saying they were . intended to keep out intruders, not to ‘imprison’ pupils. Lancashire . police said: ‘They will be given a welfare de-brief by police following . their arrival back in this country. This will signal an end of police . involvement in this matter.’","Suzannah Bunyan flew out to Dominican Republic to pick up her son Eddy Bunyan, 16, and girlfriend Indira Gainiyeva, 17, after seven-day escapade .

"By . Mark Prigg . It has become a common problem on Twitter - during major  sports events or TV shows, your feed can become overwhelmed with updates from over enthusiastic friends tweeting incessantly. Twitter today launched a solution - a mute button for users. Available to all users from today, the feature can mute irritating or boring tweets temporarily, rather than blocking the account completely. Reports emerged today Twitter is also trialling a mute option on its apps. Users said they spotted the feature on iOS and Android devices as well as Tweetdeck, pictured. The tool lets people silence users temporarily, but does not block them from sending notifications and direct messages . On Twitter, any user can be blocked. This means the blocked user can't see the tweets of the person who has blocked them, and can't send them replies or direct messages. With the mute button, users can be effectively hidden temporarily. Muting a user on Twitter means their Tweets and Retweets will no longer be visible in your home timeline, and you will no longer receive push or SMS notifications from that user. To mute a user from a Tweet on your iOS or Android device or on Twitter for web tap more and then mute @username. To mute someone from their profile page, tap the gear icon on the page and choose mute @username . 'Today we’re beginning to introduce a new account feature called mute to people who use our iPhone and Android apps and twitter.com,' the firm said. 'Mute gives you even more control over the content you see on Twitter by letting you remove a user’s content from key parts of your Twitter experience.' Muting a user on Twitter means their Tweets and Retweets will no longer be visible in your home timeline, and you will no longer receive push or SMS notifications from that user. 'In the same way you can turn on device notifications so you never miss a Tweet from your favorite users, you can now mute users you’d like to hear from less,' Twitter promised. The muted user will still be able to fave, reply to, and retweet your Tweets; you just won’t see any of that activity in your timeline. Twitter also stressed the mute feature was secret. 'The muted user will not know that you’ve muted them, and of course you can unmute at any time.' Twitter CEO Dick Costolo, pictured, made the comments during an interview with Bloomberg. He said the site was looking at introducing a 'whisper mode' that would let groups of Twitter users to talk in private - similar to direct messages but for more people . CEO Dick Costolo also hinted at introducing a ‘whisper mode’ for private conversations. Costolo made the comments during an interview with Bloomberg earlier this week. ‘There are frequently public conversations that you would like to grab hold of and take into whisper mode. Being able to move fluidly between that public conversation and the private conversation is something we’ll make simpler.’ Private conversations are already possible using direct messages (DMs), but these only apply to one-on-one discussions. Whisper mode would effectively be a group version of DMs. Twitter constantly experiments and rolls out features that don't always end up becoming permanent features. Meanwhile, the mute button started appearing across iOS and Android devices on the official Twitter app, as well as Tweetdeck, earlier today. Users have been tweeting screenshots of the tool, that lets users silence specific tweeters in a timeline. It only appears to have been rolled out to a select few. The main difference between the mute tool and the block function is that notifications and direct messages from muted users will still appear. Twitter constantly experiments and rolls out features that don't always end up becoming permanent features. When asked about Twitter testing, Costolo said: 'In our latest iOS or Android apps, there are well over 100 experiments running in each of those apps.'","Muting a user on means their Tweets and Retweets will no longer be visible .

"By . Suzannah Hills . A callous conman who killed lonely millionairess Carole Waugh was today jailed for 27 years for a murder of ‘breathtaking wickedness.’ Rakesh Bhayani, 41, killed the upmarket escort and hid her body before plundering her life savings and attempting to sell her Marble Arch flat. Together with Nicholas Kutner, 48, he used female impersonators to try and strip every asset Ms Waugh had ever owned in the hopes of hitting a ‘million pound jackpot.’ Sentencing: Rakesh Bhayani, 41, pictured left, has been jailed for 27 years at the Old Bailey for the murder of Carole Waugh, 49, pictured right . Her furniture and jewellery were sold . and her bank accounts were emptied out by the pair. They also stole her . identity and managed to defraud banks and other institutions of more . then £250,000. The Old . Bailey heard how the pair blew the money on posh hotels, prostitutes . and gambling - with Bhayani losing £200,000 at the roulette tables in . London’s West End within just a few weeks. It . was only when the pair tried to sell Ms Waugh's flat for £750,000 with . Kutner posing as Miss Waugh’s brother Chris that they were caught by . police. The jury found Bhayani guilty of murder and he admitted fraud and perverting the course of justice. Kutner . was cleared of murder but convicted of perverting the course of justice . by helping to cover up the killing. He also admitted fraud. Mr Justice Wilkie jailed Bhayani for life with a minimum recommendation of 27 years and ordered Kutner to serve 13 years. He said the murder and . subsequent dumping of the body was done with 'greed, callousness and . total lack of any regard' for Ms Waugh. Co-accused: Nicholas Kutner, 48, was jailed for a total of 13 years for perverting the course of justice by concealing the death of Ms Waugh and conspiracy to defraud . Justice Wilkie told Bhayani: 'Then . without a second thought, I am perfectly satisfied you and Kutner . calmly set about stealing her identity, using it to defraud banks and . other institutions. ‘You took steps to ensure her body would not be . found for a sufficient time, not only to give you the best chance of . avoiding detection but also to enable you to continue to embark on asset . stripping. ‘You . Kutner assisted and encouraged all in this in order to ensure that the . flow of gold from the plundered Carole Waugh estate would not stop to it . was all gone.' Ms Waugh had worked in the oil . industry in Libya and had invested money in her property, a shares portfolio and savings account. She was wealthy enough to keep £30,000 in her current account and was generous and trusting with friends. Ms Waugh met Bhayani in 2008 and the pair became casual lovers. She loaned him £12,000 which he claimed was for ‘treatment’ for his gambling problem and then another £40,000. The court heard how Bhayani killed Ms Waugh, 49, at her flat in Marylebone, central London, after a row about money. Her body was placed in a bag which was carried to a car. The vehicle was initially stored in a central London car park, then left in a rented garage in New Malden, south-west London. The court heard Kutner was in the flat when Bhayani . murdered Ms Waugh and was then on board with the actions to conceal her . death and thwart the investigation into her murder. The judge said Bhayani was the . 'instigator and chief organiser of the fraud' but both men spent Ms . Waugh’s money on 'hotels, casinos and escorts'. The judge said Bhayani’s actions in persisting with the fraud after killing Ms Waugh were 'breathtakingly wicked'. Captured: Rakesh Bhayani is pictured withdrawing money from Carole Waugh's bank account . 'Your compulsion to feed your . addictions to risk-taking and gambling and your amorality and . selfishness overwhelmed any notion of decency or restraint,' he added. Referencing . the two men’s previous convictions, Mr Justice Wilkie said the men had . an 'appalling record' for offences of dishonesty. Before . the sentencing, a statement from Ms Waugh’s family was read out in . which she was described as 'loving, supportive and great fun'. The . statement, signed by her brother, Christopher Waugh, spoke of the . 'disbelief, dismay, darkness' as the family had to 'face our worst . fears' in the wake of the murder. The court heard that five days after Ms Waugh’s funeral, her mother collapsed and later died 'broken-hearted', unable to understand how and why the tragic events unfolded. The statement said: 'She was loving, supportive and great fun. Her home visits were memorable. 'She always had great stories to tell. She turned these stories into adventures. 'For Mum, who rarely ventured out of the county of Durham, these stories were an insight not only into Carole’s life, but into the world as a whole. London, Libya, Australia, Italy, Dubai (to name but a few) were all brought to life by Carole. 'We all looked forward to Carole’s visits, especially Mum. They would plan shopping trips - nothing special but real quality time between a mother and a daughter. Millionairess Carole Waugh was stabbed to death in her flat and her body hidden in the boot of a car . 'Happy days indeed,' the statement said. Speaking . after the sentencing, Mr Waugh said the two men jailed today were . 'greedy, evil conmen who don’t have a shred of decency between them'. He . added: 'They will sleep easily in their beds as they showed no remorse . at all. I just can’t envisage any human being treating another human . being like that.' Detective Chief Inspector Justin Davies, of the Homicide and Major Crime Command (HMCC), said Ms Waugh’s murder was 'the senseless killing of a woman who put her trust in people she thought were her friends'. He said: 'Bhayani clearly had no intention of friendship with Carole. 'Bhayani is a confidence trickster who murdered her and stripped her assets and the belongings she had worked hard for. 'Both men are compulsive liars who have deceived and defrauded their own families, friends and acquaintances throughout their entire adult lives. They went to extreme lengths to defraud Carole. 'Her body was placed in a boot of a . car and left for months in car parks and a lock-up garage. Both men did . not waste any time in spending her money, using it to buy gold, use . prostitutes and live a champagne lifestyle. 'While . Carole’s body lay undiscovered, they showed no regard for her family, . who they knew were desperately seeking to trace her. The crime scene in New Malden, south west London where Miss Waugh's body was discovered . 'Ms Waugh was a wealthy woman; her years of hard work both in the UK and abroad were squandered in matter of three months. 'They took almost everything she worked for with exception of two bracelets which remained on her body. These were difficult to prise off her wrists and I have no doubt, if able to, they would have taken these items too.' Jenny Hopkins, London deputy chief crown prosecutor, said: 'Carole Waugh was the victim of a cruel and callous plot to take her money during which she tragically lost her life. 'Rakesh Bhayani was a compulsive gambler who would bet, and lose, thousands of pounds at a time. He met Carole in 2008 and from then on she lent him various sums of money. 'In return for her generosity and kindness Bhayani plotted with Nicholas Kutner a complex fraud to steal her assets. 'After Bhayani brutally murdered Carole in April 2012, he and Kutner then proceeded to cynically conceal her death in furtherance of their plan to defraud her estate. They worked together to dispose of her body and to clean and remove her belongings from her flat. 'Kutner even posed as Carole’s brother, Chris, in order to try to rent and sell her £650,000 central London flat. 'We hope the convictions today give some small comfort to Carole Waugh’s family. Our thoughts are with them at this time.'","Carole Waugh was stabbed in the neck in her Marylebone flat, London .

"By . Tracey Cox . If you're over 30 and asked how many sex partners to confess to, the correct answer is ten. The reason I know the answer to that question is because every female I know (barring those who married their childhood sweethearts) answers 'ten' whenever they're asked by a partner how many people they've slept with. Tracey says that no matter how many people you have slept with, the number will always be too high for a man . The answer stays the same even when they're a decade older and had several long-term relationships in the meantime. This is two more than the national 'official' figure. The average number of sexual partners in the 'average' woman's lifetime is eight, according to Natsal in The Lancet. The average for men is 12 partners. An average tells us nothing in this instance - researchers lump in Aunt Betty who hasn't had sex for 50 years with Becky, an 18-year-old, eagerly exploring sex for the first time, average out all the results and then call her the 'average woman'. Quite apart from how ridiculous that is, I don't think it's a question anyone should answer anyway.The reason why is this: numbers mean nothing without knowing the circumstances. Tracey says  that the number of people you have slept with has no reflection on how promiscuous you are . Reducing your sexual history to a number doesn't work. I interviewed three women a few years back for one of the books I was writing. All were around 30.The first had slept with 26 men, the second four and the third eight. No prizes for guessing which girl would be judged the harshest by a partner. But was she really the most promiscuous? Here's some more information: The girl who's had 26 lovers, has averaged around two lovers a year since she was 17 and been mainly single. The girl who'd slept with eight men, put four of those notches in the bedpost during one resort holiday (a weekend actually) while her then-husband stayed home and looked after the kids. The girl who slept with four had a threesome with two guys she met in a club. Outside, in a nearby alley. She was 18 and a self-proclaimed wild child at the time. Now what do you think? People will judge you no matter what answer you give when asked about past lovers and the assumption they make is usually wrong. Which is why I don't care who's doing the asking – whether it's your partner, mother, best friend or beauty therapist - your answer to how many lovers you've had is no answer. (The only exceptions: your psychotherapist, gynaecologist or the nice people at the GU clinic who are testing you for STIs). Keep your mouth zipped even if nothing else has been: by putting a number on your sexual history you're removing the emotion and the circumstances. And don't kid yourself: if you do blurt out a figure to your boyfriend, you will be judged – and not necessarily by the same rules he judges himself on. Even if he's slept with 300, your three will be two too many. After all, isn't the definition of a promiscuous person, someone who's slept with more than you have?

Their bloodstained bodies were discovered lying side by side in the Slateford Road, Edinburgh, property following a gas explosion at the building, each with eight stab wounds. US-born . Riggi was initially charged with murder - but admitted three counts of . the lesser charge of culpable homicide on the grounds of diminished . responsibility. She was moved to the high security hospital in 2011. Police confirmed they were called to the unit today to the death of a woman. They added they were not treating the death as suspicious. At the time of the case, the court heard the bodies of the three children were found by building manager Derek Knight on the afternoon of August 4, following a loud explosion at the property. When police entered the house they saw the three children lying side by side on the bedroom floor. They also found three knives nearby, each covered in blood, and noted large amounts of blood in numerous places throughout the house. Paramedics who went to the scene believed the children had been dead for some hours. Pathologists found all three children had multiple bruises and abrasions and died of stab wounds to the chest. Riggi, who was 46 when the tragedy occured, pictured with her three children a year before they died . On that day, neighbour Jordan Cochrane, saw Riggi climb on to the balcony after the blast before 'intentionally' falling head first. He . managed to break her fall but she was found to have four or five stab . wounds, a collapsed lung, cuts to her neck and wrist and fractures. At a previous hearing, the court heard both Riggi and her husband Pasquale, although separated, were living in Aberdeen before Riggi took the children to live at the Slateford Road property. It was stated she took the children unknown to Mr Riggi. The court heard how the couple had been involved in a legal action over the children's custody at the time of the killings. At the time, Alex Prentice QC, prosecuting, said the couple had been due to appear at a hearing the day before the youngsters' deaths. Riggi admitted culpable homicide on grounds of diminished responsibility. She was held at Cornton Vale Prison, near Stirling, but after a string of alleged attacks in 2011 she was moved to Rampton Secure Hospital . Days before the killings, Riggi told a friend things were so bad he would 'hear about it on the national news'. On . the evening of August 2, Riggi spoke to her husband on the phone. Mr . Prentice said she accused him of being in collusion with their . solicitors and asked if he would take the children away. On being told she 'left him no choice', Riggi replied 'say goodbye then' and hung up. The couple had previously lived together in the U.S., the Netherlands and Lowestoft, Suffolk. The court heard a report into Riggi's mental state - which identified narcissistic, paranoid and hysterical personality disorders. A view of Rampton Secure Hospital, where the mother was found dead. Riggi was moved to the unit in 2011 . Jailing her at the High Court in Glasgow, Lord Bracadale said: 'You have pled guilty to charges of repeatedly stabbing to death each of your twin sons, Austin and Luke, and your daughter Cecilia, aged five years. 'The result of these acts is a devastating family tragedy. The father of the children, Pasquale Riggi, and the wider family have been left utterly bereft by the loss of the children. 'And you, who had a genuine but abnormal and possessive love of your children, have lost them and are brought to this sorry pass.' He added: 'You, and others, must understand that while your responsibility is diminished, you are still responsible for your actions. Husband Pasquale Riggi. He and his wife had separated months before the tragedy . 'The effect of the diminished responsibility is to reduce these crimes from what would have been exceptionally wicked crimes of murder to what are still very serious crimes of culpable homicide. Outside court, Pasquale Riggi stood as a . statement was read out on his behalf. It spoke of his 'wonderful, . energetic, bright and happy' children who were taken away by a 'selfish, . brutal and murderous' act. In the statement read by David . Sinclair, of Victim Support Scotland, Mr Riggi said: 'I will never . forget Austin, Luke and Cecilia. They left everlasting impressions on . me. I think about them at least 100 times each day. They are in my . thoughts when I wake in the morning and before I go to sleep at night. 'They . were such wonderful energetic, bright and happy children. Those of us . who had the pleasure of knowing Cecilia, Luke and Austin, looked forward . to watching them grow while they independently navigate through their . unique life journeys. 'We are so thankful for the opportunity we . had to know and love them and the memories that we made together, . allowing us to cherish them so dearly now."" He added: ""The . horrific manner in which my children died will leave an indelible mark . on the rest of my life. As a father, my natural instincts were geared . towards safeguarding my children from the dangers of this world. 'It . pains me to the core that I was unable to protect them from the . selfish, brutal and murderous act that ended their lives so unfairly. In statement Mr Riggi read after his wife was jailed said: 'The horrific manner in which my children died will leave an indelible mark on the rest of my life' 'There . is no justification for this heinous crime, repeated three times, nor . is there any sentence that can provide justice for the overwhelming loss . of three lives and the subsequent painful grief and devastation caused . to surviving family and friends.' Riggi was held at Cornton Vale Prison, near Stirling, but after a string of alleged attacks from other inmates in 2011 she was moved to Rampton Secure Hospital in Nottinghamshire. Riggi was found dead at the unit today. A Nottinghamshire Police spokeswoman said: 'We can confirm that we were called to Rampton in the early hours of this morning to the death of a woman. 'It's not being treated as suspicious and we are preparing a file for the coroner.’ At the time, the court heard how Riggi had been 'possessive' towards her children from birth . Theresa Riggi, described in court as a paranoid and hysterical woman, might have stabbed her children to death because she believed it was the only way of keeping them safe. Riggi, who was locked in a custody battle with her husband, loved her sons and daughter 'too much', according to her lawyer Donald Findlay QC. Her 'possessive' attitude towards the children had been evident since their birth, the court was told on that day. She insisted they wore electronic 'locators', controlled by her when they were in public places, and later that they carry mobile phones pre-programmed to call her number. The situation worsened when she and her husband Pasquale Riggi began divorce proceedings which led to a bitter battle for custody of their children. Riggi, from California in the U.S., came to live in the UK 13 years ago with her husband, a Shell employee from Colorado, moving to Aberdeen in February 2007. They later separated. Mrs Riggi and the children disappeared from their Aberdeen home in July and were traced to an address in Edinburgh. A judge warned they could be in danger just 24 hours before their death when Riggi failed to appear at a divorce hearing that day. In court Alex Prentice QC, prosecuting, said that on the evening of August 2, at around 11.30pm, Riggi spoke to her husband on the phone. Mr Prentice said she accused him of being in collusion with their solicitors and asked if he would take the children away. Twins Austin and Luke and their five-year-old sister Cecilia pictured together before they were killed . On being told that she 'left him no choice', Riggi replied: 'Say goodbye then.' And she hung up. Two days later building manager Derek Knight found the bodies of the three children after a gas explosion at houses in Slateford Road, Edinburgh, where Riggi was staying in a property rented by a friend. Riggi was seen rocking back and forth on the second-floor balcony of the property before she 'intentionally' fell head-first, the court was told. She sustained several injuries, including four to five stab wounds to her body, which were believed to have been self-inflicted, and spent weeks in hospital, making her first court appearances there when part of the infirmary was temporarily designated as a court. When police entered the house in Slateford Road, they saw the three children lying side by side on the floor. They also found three knives nearby, each covered in blood. Mr Findlay told the court she was intent on suicide on the day of the killings and had left a space for herself between the children's bodies. He said that, if possible, 'she loved them too much'. A report into Riggi's mental state identified narcissistic, paranoid and hysterical personality disorders.","Theresa Riggi found dead at Rampton Secure Hospital, Nottinghamshire .

"By . Tom Kelly . and Martin Robinson . Two runaway teenage lovers who fled their £30,000-a-year public school  and flew to the Caribbean have finally been tracked down a week after going on the run. Edward Bunyan and Indira Gainiyeva have been found 'safe and well' in the Dominican Republic and will now be taken home to Britain, Lancashire Police said today. Detectives would not confirm the hotel they were staying in, but until yesterday they had been in the all-inclusive five-star Occidental hotel in Punta Cana, on the eastern edge of the island. Having been spotted yesterday they fled again, but were tracked to a different hotel and it is believed Edward's mother is now with them. Hunt is over: Edward Bunyan and Indira Gainiyeva, both pupils of Stonyhurst College in Lancashire, were traced to the Occidental Hotel, pictured, having fled to the Dominican Republic last week . Edward, 16, and Indira, who turned 17 last week, used their credit cards at the luxury resort, local police said. The pair, who are said to have been dating for several months, sneaked out of the prestigious Stonyhurst College last Monday and jetted to the Dominican Republic, after telling friends they were sick of the rainy weather. The school has refused to be drawn on whether the pair will be suspended or expelled. Their vanishing act created an international media sensation, and pupils at the mixed-sex boarding school in Clitheroe, Lancashire, have nicknamed them Bonnie and Clyde. But Lancashire Police said today the hunt for them was over. 'The students have thankfully been located safe and well at a hotel in the Punta Cana area of the Dominican Republic,' a spokesman said. Plans are now being made for their safe return to the UK. They will be given a welfare debrief by police following their arrival back in this country. 'Our priority throughout this has been to ensure the safety and welfare of these students and after they have been spoken to on their return this will signal an end of police involvement in this matter.' Runaways: Edward, 16, and Indira, who turned 17 last week have been nicknamed Bonnie and Clyde following their disappearing act. Stonyhurst head Andrew Johnson said he was 'absolutely delighted' they were found. He said there will be discussions with them and their families when they return but it was too early to speculate about their future. In a statement he said: 'We are absolutely delighted to be able to report that the two missing pupils have been found safe and well by police in the Dominican Republic. 'They are currently in the care of the police and a family member. 'Staff and pupils at the College have been concerned in recent days for the safety of the two. 'We are really most grateful to parents and friends of Stonyhurst for their overwhelming support at this difficult time, and for their prayers for the safety of the two young people. 'Over the coming days we will be having discussions with the two young people and their families about what has happened and also what happens next. 'However, it is simply too early at the moment to speculate about the future.' Edward – an experienced international . traveller who previously attended schools in Spain and Canada – is  the . Cheltenham-born son of a civil engineer, while Indira’s family are from . oil-rich Kazakhstan. The . 800-room Occidental hotel is used by British tour operator Thomson and described as . a ‘Spanish-style all inclusive resort with impressive facilities, . nestled on a beautiful beachfront with coconut palms dotted on the . shoreline’. It boasts three lagoon-style swimming . pools, a spa, gym, tennis courts, nine themed restaurants, scuba diving . facilities, seven bars and live nightly shows. The resort is about seven . hours by car from the resort of Puerto Plata, which the pair were . believed to have flown into. A seven-night Thomson package holiday at the hotel costs £1,672 per person. Indira appeared to have logged on to the Russian equivalent of Facebook yesterday, suggesting the pair are active online and may be aware of the police hunt and the media attention surrounding their disappearance. Her parents had yesterday pleaded for her to send a text ‘or anything’ to show she is safe. Staff at the £30,000-a-year Stonyhurst College in Clitheroe, Lancashire, realised they were missing only when they failed to turn up for school register . Indira’s father Ravil Gainiyev, a wealthy Kazakh businessman, said he had not heard from her since she left school at 3am and caught a taxi to Manchester Airport with her boyfriend. He said: ‘I called her and sent her messages but she did not answer.’ Mr Gainiyev, 50, said he did not want to cancel her credit card because he was afraid it could mean she and Edward would be ‘forced to be tramps’. Indira’s 46-year-old mother Firuza said from her home in Kyzylorda, southern Kazakhstan: ‘I beg and pray she is in good health. She knows that she and our other children mean  more than anything for myself and my husband.’","Edward Bunyan and Indira Gainiyeya fled to Dominican Republic last week .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . The upcoming U.S. Open tennis tournament at Flushing Meadows in Queens, New York, has being named as a potential target by an Al Qaeda group. Speaking at a counterterror briefing for both civilian and law enforcement officials on Wednesday,  NYPD Director of Intelligence Analysis Rebecca Weiner said the venue had been suggested as a target in the most recent edition of Inspire, the English-language online publication of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. She said the magazine detailed how to build a car bomb and suggested it be targeted at large gatherings of people, rather than buildings, and listed other locations in New York, Washington and Virginia. Rafael Nadal poses with the U.S. Open Championship trophy after winning the men's singles final last year, this year's event faces a risk of terrorism activity . 'We will ensure that the suggestions in this magazine remain hypothetical,' Weiner said. This year's tournament is scheduled to run between August 25 and September 8. Also on Wednesday, Boston Police Commissioner Edward Davis gave a detailed presentation on the April 2013 Boston Marathon bombing attacks that killed three people and injured more than 260 others. Davis said the lessons he took away from the attack and the ensuing investigation were to stay vigilant, prepare, and partner with other agencies. Using social media, especially Twitter, was a key to correcting misinformation distributed by the media in the days following the attack as authorities worked to identify and then locate the suspects, he said. 'Trying to get the proper message out among the people who are coming from all over the world to report on this incident cannot be done unless you have your own ability with social media to correct bad information and get valid information out there,' he said.

"By . Ashley Pearson . Reports that multi-millionairess Cheryl Fernandez-Versini nee Tweedy, formerly Cole is moving to Dalston to help her husband in the kitchen of his new restaurant are to be taken lightly – but to be honest, these days, it wouldn't exactly shock me if this actually happened. Billionaire businesswoman and reality star Jessica Simpson, married just at the weekend to her unemployed baby daddy Eric, is already signing off on Instagram as Jessica Johnson. Beyonce, currently beleaguered with rumours of marriage woes, named her previous tour, not 'Girls Run the World' but 'the Mrs Carter Show'. Ashley says women like Cheryl, who have built up their own career, shouldn't have to drop it or take a backseat to please their man . Jennifer Aniston, massively famous in Friends at the time, legally became Mrs Pitt after her marriage to Brad, and sent out all personal correspondence for years on stylish 'Jennifer Pitt' stationery. And whilst opinion formers now work overtime to reclaim the word 'feminism', there is a distinct trend going on right now - and it feels a little old school to me. Yes, it's about taking his name in public, but it's more than that. There's a whole lot of deferring happening in Hollywood these days. Sometimes it feels like a return to the Fifties – making sure to always take into account your man's feelings and yes, his ego. Not too long ago, Jennifer Aniston is rumoured to have moved the entire production of Life Of Crime from Detroit to NYC in order to be closer to fiancé Justin Theroux, who lived there. Actress Jennifer Garner dutifully follows husband Ben Affleck from red carpet to red carpet supporting his career - actor Mark Ruffalo even recently implied he and Jen are no longer friends because Ben wasn't comfortable with it . Fashionista and actress Blake Lively skipped New York Fashion Week (forfeiting a mid-six figures in fees) for the first time ever, in order to visit her new husband Ryan Reynolds, then filming in Canada. Actress Jennifer Garner dutifully follows hubby Ben Affleck from red carpet to red carpet supporting his career; and actor Mark Ruffalo recently implied he and Jen are no longer friends because hubby Ben wasn't comfortable with it. After they began dating Jennifer Lopez immediately promoted former boyfriend and back up dancer Casper Smart to 'Tour/Choreographer Manager' bestowing a generous raise and including him at all major red carpet events. Ashley believes more women are taking a backseat to make their husbands feel like 'the man' Kim Kardashian West recently told her multi-million dollar reality show mom-ager Kris, this about her career: 'Kanye comes first.' Indeed it seems that more and more famous women are taking a back seat in order to make their man feel like 'the man'. Just like The Rules before them, books like The Proper Care And Feeding Of Husbands and The Surrendered Wife, can certainly provoke a hefty amount of eye rolling. The underlying principle of course being that the control women wield at work and with children must be left at the front door of any happy marriage. With this in mind, as divorce rates remain high, and discontented marriages abound, some of the world's most famously strong and powerful women appear to be working overtime to put their men firmly out in front. It is likely that Cheryl Cole will always be more famous than her handsome French husband – and likely, although it's continues to be widely reported he 'comes from a wealthy family' she will always have more money. But by taking his name so publicly and immediately she's making a statement (as well as conveniently losing that last reminder of her errant ex), that she belongs to HIM. She's also said to have refused to sign a pre-nup and is already learning French. Jumping in with both feet as she is, with a clear indication of her certainty and commitment, let's hope it's a promising sign for a marriage and a commitment based on just three months of togetherness.","Ashley says that more female celebrities are putting their man first .

"By . Jack Doyle . Large families could see their child benefit slashed under plans being submitted to ministers. Payments should be cut sharply for children after the third and limited to just four children in future, an influential think tank said. The proposal, which is published today by the centre-right Policy Exchange, would save £1billion over five years as benefit payments to large families would rise at a lower annual rate than those to smaller families. Cut: The proposal published by the centre-right Policy Exchange would reduce payments to a family with four children by more than £135 a year by 2020 (file picture) It would reduce payments to a family with four children by more than £135 a year by 2020 – and go some way to help ministers hit their target of saving £12billion from the welfare budget over the next parliament. It is likely to cause controversy – as families who currently receive payments for several children would see their benefits gradually reduced. However, it may be seen as a more palatable option than imposing a stricter ‘cap’ on the number of children for whom parents can claim. A YouGov poll, commissioned as part of the research, found two thirds of the public support capping child benefit at four children. This was backed by more than 83 per cent of Tory voters and more than half of Labour and Lib Dem voters. Steve Hughes, the report author, said: ‘The Chancellor has suggested that annual welfare savings of £12billion will have to be found to avoid further and faster cuts to departmental budgets. ‘Choosing where this money comes from is not easy, but with such high levels of public support, capping child benefit at four children and redesigning payment levels offers a very real opportunity to generate some much needed savings in the fairest way possible.’ This financial year, families receive £20.50 a week for their first child and £13.55 a week for each additional child, with no cap on numbers. Decision: The reports author Steve Hughes said choosing where welfare cuts should be made is not easy . Payment amounts had been frozen since 2011 but rose by 1 per cent this tax year, with the same rise due next year. Policy Exchange proposes that until 2019/20 – the end of the next parliament – child benefit for the first child should rise by 1 per cent a year. For the second child the amount should rise by 2 per cent a year and for the third child by 1 per cent a year. But for the fourth child and any further children, the amount would be frozen at the 2015/16 level of £13.70 throughout the parliament. In addition, it suggests the Government could go a step further and stop child benefit for any additional children after the fourth, born after April 2016. If the policy was implemented, a family of four would see their annual child benefit cheque fall from £3,481.40 to £3,346.20. George Osborne has suggested that a Conservative government would seek to save billions more from the welfare budget if the party wins the next election. In January last year, around 1.1million parents lost some or all of their child benefit as income-related changes came into force. Families in which one parent earns more than £60,000 before tax lost the benefit entirely, while those earning more than £50,000 lost some of it on a sliding scale.","It would reduce payments to a family with four children by more than £135 .

"By . Wills Robinson . and Daily Mail Reporter . Claims: The veteran DJ, pictured arriving at court today, is alleged to have groped the woman while she was dancing . Dave Lee Travis told a British . Airways sales rep she had ‘won the key’ to his room after sexually . assaulting her at a Christmas party, a court heard yesterday. The . former BBC Radio 1 DJ, pictured, made a beeline for the young woman at . the start of a lambada dance and allegedly told her: ‘I’m claiming this . dance.’ Travis, now . 68, groped her during the dance before dragging her to a table where he . was sitting with BA executives, the court was told. As . hundreds of staff celebrated at the work party, the DJ forced her to . sit on his knee and then pushed his hand up her skirt, the jury was . told. He then ‘touched her intimately’, it was alleged. The woman, now 43, told Southwark Crown Court yesterday that she tried to distract the DJ by talking about a raffle ticket. When she told him she had not won a prize Travis stuck the ticket to his head and said: ‘You’ve won the key to my room.’ The . DJ, whose real name is David Griffin, was the star act at the party in a . Manchester Airport function room in 1993, it was said. Both times she said he grabbed her to dance the Lambada and described how he became sexually 'aroused' after 'grinding' against her. Giving evidence from behind a screen, the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said after she was forced to dance with him she planned to make her 'escape' but he 'didn't let go'. She told jurors she considered just sitting next to Travis before politely making her excuses and leaving, claiming she did not want to make a scene. But then, he allegedly pulled her on to his knee before placing his left hand on her thigh. 'His left hand started creeping up my leg,' she said. 'I immediately put my hands on it. My hands were both on it permanently trying to push it down.' But she said Travis was much stronger than her and he then started rubbing his thumb against her groin. 'First of all he was rubbing on the outside of my knickers and then on the inside,' she told the court. The woman said she decided to try to distract Travis by talking about the raffle that had taken place as part of the evening’s events as there was a ticket lying on the table in front of them. 'I said to him I hadn’t won anything. That’s when he slapped it on his head and said ""You’ve won the key to my room"".' Grasp: The unidentified woman said she tried to escape from the 68-year-old but he 'didn't let go' The woman said she was 'really scared' and when she said she wanted to go to the toilet with a colleague, . Travis said: 'Don’t confer with your friends.' 'He said ""There’s a toilet at my hotel"".' The . alleged victim said she thought Travis was a 'dirty perv' and a 'dirty . old man' but did not go to police at the time as she was 'too young and . too stupid'. But she decided . to tell her friends what happened after the allegations about Jimmy . Savile came out and said: 'Mark my words, he’ll be next.' The woman told the court she first encountered Travis a few weeks before the Christmas party when he compered an event, organised after company targets were reached. She said he organised a Lambada dance competition, which he judged and she and her partner won. The woman said there was a 'Latin American atmosphere' in the room as they performed the intimate dance, which involved couples getting up close and holding hands. She said that, after naming her as the winner, he ordered that the song be repeated and 'then he grabbed me as his partner and started dancing with me'. The woman told the court that he 'kept pinning me against his leg' as they danced. 'He was sexually aroused,' she said. 'I was trying to put as much distance . between us as could as I thought it was inappropriate but he was a lot . bigger than me and he kept pinning me against his leg. Master of ceremonies: Travis was a compere at the corporate event where he is accused of groping the woman . 'He was old enough to be my father. I just thought ""dirty perv"".' Asked . why she did not tell her bosses or police what had happened at the . time, the woman said: 'He was a big star. I thought 'Who was going to . believe me?'"" The woman said she then encountered . Travis again when he was the compere and DJ at the Christmas party and . did her best to avoid him. But claims she realised he had seen her and he requested that guests dance the Lambada again. She told jurors: 'Dave Lee Travis made a beeline for me and said he was claiming this dance as his again. Everybody was cheering.' The woman said she was 'in shock' when . she eventually left the party and vaguely remembered being put in a car . by a colleague, who drove them away. A . friend of the alleged victim also gave evidence to the court and said . she told them what Travis allegedly did to her during conversations they . had in September or October 2012. Another . woman told the court she thought Travis was a 'dirty old man' after he . put his hand up her skirt during a car journey when she was 21. The woman, who was sharing a lift with . Travis and her friend after a party, said she was . 'absolutely shocked and mortified'. She . told the court that Travis asked her what she did and, when he found out she was a student nurse, he asked if she wore stockings. She said she was embarrassed by the . question and could not remember what she replied, but he then 'put his . hand into the back of the car and pushed it up my skirt'. 'He put his hand between my legs on top of my thighs,' she said. She 'pushed them away as hard as I could' and used 'quite a lot' of force. 'I was pushing hard and for a few moments he was pushing back,' she said. Fame: The former Radio 1 presenter is currently on trial for sex offences. He denies 13 indecent assault charges and one sexual assault, dating back to 1976 and the height of his fame. The woman, who also gave evidence from behind a screen, said she was a 'shy and quiet girl' and so did not say anything at the time. 'I just put it down to him being a dirty old man,' she said. The woman said she went to police last year after reading a newspaper article in which he defended himself after other allegations against him surfaced. She told jurors: 'He was quoted as saying he would never behave in that way. I thought ""Well, you did behave in that way to me"".' Wearing a grey woollen blazer, dark trousers and a multi-coloured tie, Travis sat in the dock and listened to the evidence through headphones. Travis, denies 13 indecent assaults and one sexual assault, dating back to 1976 and the height of his fame. The alleged offending includes when he . was working as a BBC DJ, as a broadcaster with Classic Gold radio, while . appearing on Top Of The Pops, and when starring in panto.

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated  Press Reporter . Two registered sex offenders stand accused of raping and killing four California women since October of last year - and police believe there are likely more victims. Transients Franc Cano, 27, and Steven Gordon, 45, were each charged Monday with four felony counts each of special circumstances murder and rape of women with histories of prostitution, but more charges are likely to come. Both accused killers were wearing ankle monitors last fall when the women were killed in Anaheim and Santa Ana, Anaheim Chief Raul Quezada said during a Monday press briefing. Gordon has admitted to killing a raping five women, a police source told CBS Los Angeles, but no information regarding the fifth victim has been made public. Scroll down for video . Serial killers?: Stephen Dean Gordon, 45, left, and Franc Cano, 27, who were arrested on Friday and charged with the rape and murder of four women . The case broke open when the body of Jarrae Nykkole Estepp, 21, was found on a recycling plant conveyer belt, authorities said. 'The lifestyle that we are aware of of these four individuals, their pattern of behavior and the location where they frequented ties the four of them together,' said Anaheim Police chief Ralph Quezada. Officials said they also used both the GPS readings from their ankle bracelets and their supposed victims' cell phone records to match up the times and places where the slayings are believed to have occurred. The discovery brought to an end the serial killings, but investigators said they are convinced there is at least one more victim, and perhaps several more even outside of California, cops said. 'They put a stop to a serial killing that would likely have continued beyond this point,' District Attorney Tony Rackauckas added. Victims: Martha Anaya (left) and Josephine Monique Vargas (right) were both raped and killed by the duo . Also killed: Kianna Jackson (left) and Jarrae Nykkole Estepp were also found raped and murdered . The big break: Police began tying the suspected serial killings together after Estepp's body was found at this Anaheim recycling plant last month . Both men were arrested Saturday and . charged Monday with four counts each of special circumstances murders . and rapes of Estepp, Martha Anaya, 28, Josephine Vargas, 34, and Kianna . Jackson, 20. Special . circumstances murder charges are filed when the killings are committed . during rape or when there is more than one victim, according to the . Orange County District Attorney's Office. If convicted, the men could face a minimum sentence of life without parole or the death penalty. Authorities believe the two men have . known each other since at least 2012, when they chopped off their ankle . buses and rode a Greyhound bus to Las Vegas under fake names before . eventually being arrested and returned of California. They . were required to check in with police every 30 days after that and . provide addresses, finger prints and photos - but that didn't stop their . violent rampage. Jackson, their first-known victim, went missing October 20 in Santa Ana. She had flown in from Vegas to face prostitution charges and disappeared shortly after her court hearing, even failing to check in with her mother. Grief-stricken: A portrait of murder victim Martha Anaya, left, is displayed on a table as her mother Herlinda Salcedo cries Sunday . The strip: This is the road all of the victims were known to frequent, a strip popular with Johns looking to score a prostitute . Grim task: Unidentified relatives of Vargas hang missing posters hoping that someone will find the missing woman . Vargas . went missing October 24 after leaving a family party. She had battled . drug addictions and had a history of prostitution, her family said, but . they insisted she was trying to better her life. Anaya . went missing November 12 after asking her boyfriend to pick up her . five-year-old daughter from school so she could work that night. She . also had a history prostitution charges. 'It's so hard for my family, so hard for my sister. We've been doing a lot of things to find her,' Anaya's aunt, Angelica Salcedo, told KABC. 'It's so hard, there's no word to explain the pain.' Anaya's grief-stricken daughter struggled to find words to comprehend what has happened to his mother. 'My mom was a good person, I don't see why anyone would want to hurt her in any way,' Melody Anaya told the station before pausing to gather her thoughts. 'She didn't deserve it.' Their bodies still have not been found, according to KABC. Devastated: Melody Anaya says she can't imagine why anyone would want to hurt her mother . Long haul ahead: Police found Estepp's body at this recycling plant, but will now begin searching local landfills for the other four victims . Estepp was known among local law . enforcement for frequenting an Anaheim road known to Johns as an easy . spot to score prostitutes. After her body was found on the conveyer belt, evidence led to Cano and Gordon. Authorities then linked the previous missing women to her case and realized they had potential serial killers on their hands. Without any leads on where the other bodies may be, police admitted to CBS Los Angeles they will begin searching to local landfills for their bodies. They are being held without bail and are scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday.","Franc Cano and Steven Gordon, both homeless and living on the streets of Anaheim, have been accused of the rapes and murders of four prostitutes .

"By . Helen Pow . A 19-year-old Russian man, who is a student at Penn State University, has been charged with possession of a weapon of mass destruction. Altoona police said Sunday that officers were investigating a reported marijuana-growing operation at Vladislav Miftakhov's Juniata apartment when they discovered a homemade bomb and bomb-making materials in a suitcase. Miftakhov, from Moscow, was arrested and charged with possessing a weapon of mass destruction, risking a catastrophe, possessing instruments of crime, prohibited offensive weapons, incendiary devices, recklessly endangering another person, and several drug-related charges. Scroll down for video . Mass destruction: Vladislav Miftakhov, pictured, a Russian citizen, was arrested and charged with possessing a weapon of mass destruction, risking a catastrophe and drug-related offenses . He remains in Blair County Prison in lieu of $500,000 bail, Blair County corrections officer James McMahon said. According to a criminal complaint, police found one pound of atomized magnesium and one pound of Chinese potassium perchlorate along with a package labeled potassium nitrate powder. In additional, they found fuses and several containers of compressed air. When asked what he was going to do with two devices that were found with exposed fuses, Miftakhov said 'he was going to blow things up,' the complaint alleges. He didn't, however, specify a target. According to CNN, the teen later told investigators he was experimenting with making 'flash powder' and only intended to detonate the devices in a field. He said then that he 'wasn't going to blow anything up.' Boom: When asked what he was going to do with two devices that were found with exposed fuses, Miftakhov, pictured left and right, said 'he was going to blow things up' He said he previously experimented with homemade bombs while living in California. His Facebook page lists California as his home and Moscow as his hometown. His parents live in California, an official said. The Pennsylvania State Police bomb squad 'safely deconstructed' the device, officials said. Miftakhov told police he purchased materials for the bomb on Amazon over the past few weeks, and assembled the explosives in his room. The Russian will next appear in court on February 5. He will be assigned a public defender, McMahon said. Altoona Mayor Matthew Pacifico confirmed Miftakjov is a freshman at Penn State University Altoona. He told Fox News the city had 'quite a scare.' Scene: Officers were investigating a reported marijuana-growing operation at Vladislav Miftakhov's Juniata apartment, pictured, when they discovered a homemade bomb and bomb-making materials in a suitcase . 'This is something you hear about in big cities or movies, but not something you would think would happen in a place like Altoona,' he said. Andrew Leff, who lived in the same building as Miftakhov described the man to CNN affiliate WTAJ as 'the weirdest individual that I've ever met.' Leff told the Altoona Mirror that Miftakhov had recently set off three small homemade bombs outside the apartment, leaving small craters in the ground. He said that he warned the teen to get rid of the bomb-making materials. He called Miftakhov 'dumb' and 'crazy,' but not dangerous. Another roommate, Steven Taylor, said Miftakhov was quiet. 'He barely talked,' he told the newspaper. The alleged bomb-making materials have been sent to the state police lab in Harrisburg and the ATF and FBI are helping with the investigation. In the search of the apartment, which Miftakhov has rented since August, police said they also found five young marijuana plants, a lighting setup that included aluminum foil and plant food.","Vladislav Miftakhov was arrested and charged with possessing a weapon of mass destruction, risking a catastrophe and drug-related offenses .

"By . Peter Allen . Furious French Ryanair passengers launched a 'barbaric' revolt against plane crew because of anger over a delay, it was claimed today. Police were called when they abused staff of the low-cost airline, refused to accept instructions, and stole duty free products including alcoholic drinks and perfume from trollies. The angry rebellion is said to have taken place on a flight which took off from Rabat, in Morocco, to Paris's Beauvais airport last Saturday week. Police were called when Ryanair passengers abused staff of the low-cost airline in Paris and refused to accept instructions . France's Metronews today reports that it all started when a passenger among the 170 people on board became seriously ill. The crew had to divert to Madrid to deal with the medical emergency, meaning that by the time they took off from Spain again it was too late to head for Paris, where airports have night time noise restrictions. Instead, the plane landed in Nantes, western France, where everyone was told they would have to spend the night. The flight from Rabat to Paris should have been just two-and-a-half hours long, but was rapidly turning into a 24 hour saga - meaning tensions were high. It was at Nantes airport that the trouble really started, with one baggage handler saying passengers displayed 'almost animal and barbaric behaviour towards the plane, the crew and the ground staff.' Police arrived to keep the peace, but they could do little to stop the passengers' disgraceful behaviour continuing on the plane. Passenger revolt: A Ryanair Boeing 737-200 at Beauvais airport, northern France . The plane was en route from Rabat in Morocco when the incident happened. It landed in Nantes, western France, where everyone was told they would have to spend the night . Cigarettes, food, drinks, perfume and 'anything else of value' was stolen, says Metronews, while 'uhappy' and 'especially disrespectful passengers' effectively took their crew hostage. One passenger told the paper: 'I have nothing to reproach the airport staff or the police for, they were very professional. 'I am neither a robber nor a hostage taker. We were tired and annoyed by a mismanaged situation. We were thirsty, hungry, and had no information on our fate. 'We compensated ourselves by taking some drinks and food. After seven hours stuck in the plane, instead of two and a half, people needed to eat.' Following a few hours in a hotel, Ryanair eventually provided coaches to Paris, where the passengers arrived on Sunday morning. A Ryanair spokesman said that a 'flight from Rabat to Paris Beauvais diverted into Madrid after a passenger became ill on board. 'On arrival in Madrid, the passenger disembarked and was assisted by local medical services and the aircraft continued onwards to Paris a short time later. 'However, due to an airport curfew at Paris Beauvais the aircraft diverted to Nantes Airport. Passengers were provided with overnight hotel accommodation and were transferred to Paris Beauvais by coach the following morning.'","Police were called when they abused staff of the low-cost airline .

"By . Amie Keeley . A customer has described her horror at finding mouldy food, congealed fat and stagnant water on the shelves of a Tesco superstore. When Sylvia Tyler noticed the filth, which sat alongside dozens of fresh food items, she complained to store bosses - but they told her the area was 'difficult to clean'. And two weeks later, the shelves had still not been cleaned even though the huge supermarket employs 600 staff. Officials have launched an investigation into the store owned by Britain's biggest retailer, which has previously been fined thousands of pounds for breaching hygiene rules. Filth: A Tesco customer found the supermarket's shelves caked in grime with food items just lying around . Complaint: Sylvia Tyler noticed the off-putting scene at a superstore in Slough, pictured . Photographs of the mess at the Tesco Extra superstore in Slough, Berkshire show what appears to be congealed cream and fat, old food debris and layers of dirt in pools of water standing in the gaps between the shelves. Ms Tyler, 42, was browsing the 'reduced to clear' section when she noticed the dirt as well as a packet of ham trapped between the cabinets. 'I just happened to look down and thought to myself, ""Look at the state of that,""' she told the Mail. 'I turned to another customer next to me and said ""Have you seen that?"" and he said, ""I'm not touching anything for sale on here.""' The mother of three approached a store supervisor and pointed out the filth - but she claims he was 'blasé' about the problem. 'I said, ""Don't you think this needs to . be sorted out? This is a health and safety issue."" He said it was . difficult to clean but would ask a staff member to sort it out. But he . didn't seem at all bothered.' Anger: Ms Tyler says that a store manager told her the shelves were 'difficult to clean' Grimy: There appeared to be bits of food and stagnant water in between many of the shelves . When Ms Tyler visited the store again two weeks later, the shelves were apparently in an even worse state than before - and the same pack of ham was still there. She inspected other aisles, and found a thick mouldy residue in the dairy section. 'I was mortified,' she said. 'The air can circulate and contaminate the food. I was disgusted that they're kept in this state and incredibly disappointed that such a big company hasn't taken any action. 'If that's what it's like on display, what's it like behind the scenes?' Ms Tyler has since reported the issue to local environmental health officials. A spokesman for Slough Borough Council said that they have received a complaint and are currently looking into it. Apology: Tesco says it is 'disappointed' by the failure to clean the shelves properly . Report: Ms Tyler complained to her local environmental health department about the incident . A spokesman for Tesco said the supermarket giant was 'disappointed' to hear of the incident, and assured customers that the shelves in the Slough store have now been cleaned. 'We maintain very high standards of hygiene and cleanliness in our stores, and we're disappointed that those were not met on this occasion,' he said. 'Colleagues regularly deep-clean all of the shelving in the stores and we've taken action to return the shelves to their usual high standards.' Last year the company was fined £45,000 after health inspectors found that one of their London stores was infested with mice. The Tesco Metro outlet in Covent Garden was covered in dirt and rodent droppings, a court heard - while one inspector found an enormous 'super mouse' running around the premises. In the past five years, three other branches of the retail giant have been fined for unhygienic conditions. In addition, the supermarket was at the centre of last year's horsemeat scandal after it emerged that some of its own-brand mince products contained up to 60 per cent horse instead of beef.","Sylvia Tyler found the shelves of Tesco branch in Slough covered in filth .

"By . Barbara Jones . Shots echo in the street below as my phone rings. It’s just after dawn in a Baghdad under curfew. The head of the Mahdi Army – the fanatical Shia force and avowed enemies of the West – has agreed to see me: but on his terms. I must venture into Sadr City, the slum district of the Iraqi capital that defied British and American occupation for a decade. Now the militants have a new enemy – the Sunni terror group Isis, who have left a trail of blood across Iraq and are fast closing in on Baghdad itself. In the enemy's lair: Barbara Jones with Ibrahim al-Jaberi, both circled with his militia men . That has not dimmed the army’s hatred of the West – and I will be told in no uncertain terms that foreign intervention will be ‘unacceptable’. But first I must get to Sadr City, a volatile place with a ‘fight-to-the-death’ spirit, whose streets have seen terrible sectarian bloodshed. It was named after the father of Moqtada al-Sadr, the army’s founder. He was a Grand Ayatollah who stood up to Saddam Hussein and was shot dead by the dictator’s Sunni supporters. I had encountered the Mahdi Army before. In 2005, when I was with a British Army patrol in Basra, we were attacked by their fighters aiming rocket-propelled grenades at us. Yet now I am speaking to them; agreeing to the instructions for this meeting: I am to drive to the Habibi Hospital, call a number, and wait for Al-Sadr’s men. The militant leader knows no compromise, and only last week warned America and her allies to ‘take their hands off Iraq’. He claims to have re-invented his fighting force as a ‘peace brigade’ to defend Baghdad. Driving through empty early-morning streets, the dashboard shows a  temperature of 41C (106F), another  day of suffocating heat. Inside our car, flak jackets are flattened against the doors, protection against roadside bombs that kill four people a day here. Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, who al-Jaberi says they reject as the leader of Iraq . This is a city in a state of siege, nervously awaiting, fearing, an attack by the Sunni forces or a return of the Americans. Checkpoints, car searches and blast walls are all a way of life. We arrive at the hospital, a sad run-down structure surrounded by rolls of barbed wire. Seven Mahdi Army men soon pull up, all in black police uniforms and bristling with weapons. They check our papers and signal for us to follow them through the rubbish-strewn streets. Low-key is not their style. Their Ford pick-up careers through busy markets with much hooting of horns and screeching of brakes. Any vehicles getting in the way end up at the dangerous end of a rifle barrel. Residents live their lives, opening pavement kiosks, servicing rundown cars and recycling tyres. Two sheep are led into a butcher’s shop to meet their fate. Cans of petrol are lined up at the roadside, a symbol of poverty in an oil-rich country. But no one looks up as we speed past. People here are trained to see only what they need to see. Eventually we skid around a corner between broken buildings. White gates swing open on to a courtyard. A striking figure in a turban comes out to greet us –  the man we have come to meet, cleric-cum-warlord Ibrahim al-Jaberi, Al-Sadr’s commander in Baghdad. Our escort excitedly surround him, scrambling for photos. Once in his reception room, with its garish red velvet furniture and an excerpt from the Koran engraved on a goat-skin, it is clear Al-Jaberi is playing games with us. All of his pronouncements carry an underlying menace. Fingering prayer beads, he says: ‘We have changed. We are warriors for peace now, we don’t want war. We want the people of Iraq to unite against our new enemy [Isis]. In the past our enemies were America and Britain, invading our country. Our duty then was to get them out.’ All the rockets, the heavy artillery, the cans of Semtex,  the ammo vests of the suicide bombers we saw in a big parade of peace brigade force last weekend – they are all for defence, he insists. ‘We will use those weapons if Isis comes to Baghdad. And we will not work alongside the Iraqi military. We will not take orders from them.’ Members of the Mahdi Army, who have a new enemy, the Sunni terror group Isis, who have left a trail of blood across Iraq . He flinches as I take something from my rucksack and I realise: the armed escort, the secrecy, it was all for his security, not ours. I smile reassuringly at him. We are both aware of the  danger we represent to each other. Al-Jaberi has a warning: ‘We reject Nouri al-Maliki, the prime minister, and Usama al-Nujaifi, speaker of parliament. They are thieves and bad leaders. We want them to go, we have nothing but contempt for them. We also reject outside interference. We will not accept America or Britain interfering again. We don’t want Syria or Iran or any other foreign forces here. ‘What would Britain do if foreign forces invaded? That would lead to violence for you, would it not?’ The veiled threat hangs in the air. This was a man delivering his master’s message. Leaving Al-Jaberi’s lair, we found ourselves on the streets without an escort. Now we were on our own. A phone call brings us a security guard on a motor-scooter who leads us out of the slum. Sadr City is behind us now, but what happens here next could seal the future of Iraq, and beyond.","The Madhi Army have a new enemy - the Sunni terror group Isis .

'The witness who observed the silver mini-van and its driver did not see Jessica at any time,' Shaw said. 'The witness was not aware of Jessica’s abduction until officers began their initial investigation, therefore, had no reason to believe the van was involved in a crime or to take additional actions, like call 911.' Shaw also said that investigators believe the silver Chrysler Town and Country mini-van spotted may still be involved. 'Based on the fact the driver has not been identified and the van’s departure from the Exxon store is within the timeline of Jessica’s disappearance, investigators still believe it may be involved,' he said. The driver is reportedly a 6-foot-tall white man, who may be between 30 and 40 years old. He has a medium to heavy build with broad shoulders and light brown or blond wavy hair with a center part, the website reports. The Exxon Mobil gas station at 1196 E. Sternberg Road in Norton Shores, Michigan where Heeringa was last seen is viewable in this file photo . Norton Shores Police Chief Dan Shaw, seen in this May 2013 file photo, has said the disappearance is the department's 'top priority' Heeringa is mother to son Zeven, 4, but he is no longer in contact with her family, Fox17 reported. Heeringa is also unlikely to have faked an abduction, Shaw said -- since her blood was found at the scene as well as hundreds of dollars. 'Based on evidence obtained at the scene, including Jessica’s blood from the pavement outside of the store, the fact that hundreds of dollars in cash [both Jessica’s and the store’s] was left behind and based on behavioral information we have developed during the investigation, it is highly unlikely that she is intentionally missing,' Shaw told mlive.com. Shaw also said the case is the department's 'top priority.' Former members of a task force that was formed to pursue the case after Heeringa vanished continue to work together, Shaw said. The task force included police in Muskegon, the Muskegon County sheriff's department, state police and federal officials. 'Members of the former task force have met on several occasions to review information received and the investigative reports compiled since it was disbanded to help ensure a comprehensive review has been conducted,' Shaw said. The reward for information is up to $15,160.

"By . Emma Thomas . A man hacked off his own leg using only a metal saw, a small fruit knife and a back scratcher wrapped with a towel because he couldn't afford hospital bills. According to Shanghaiist.com, Zheng Yanliang, 47, from Boading city, China, began to experience bouts of pain in his abdomen that traveled to both of his legs. He was diagnosed with massive arterial thrombosis in both legs. As the pain worsened, he decided to take the gruesome step of removing the infected limb himself to avoid the expensive hospital bill. Excruciating: Mr Yanliang took the desperate step of removing his own infected right leg. He had been diagnosed with massive thrombosis and was in severe pain . Angiograms taken before the home amputation showed that all of the arteries in his right leg were completely gone. Doctors told the Mr Yanliang, known in his town as being a 'tough guy', the disease was very rarely seen, and he wasn't likely to live more than a month. For three months, Mr Yanliang was tormented by pain to the point of fuzzy consciousness, screaming so loud that his neighbors could not sleep. He said. 'It was very painful and they gave me medication but it didn't help.' The farmer went to several hospitals in Beijing and Hebei but every time . he was simply sent home with more medication to his farm in . Qingyuan county's Dongzang village. He said: 'Sometimes the pain was so intense I would pass out, then after . three months when it was really bad, they told me that an infection had . set in, that I had gangrene, and that I might lose the limb. 'Ideally I . needed it to be operated on, but I could not afford it. They just gave . me medication. They sent me home to die.' One night, after his wife had gone to bed, Mr Yanliang found a fruit knife, a metal saw and a towel-wrapped back scratcher and began amputating his own leg. Zheng Yanliang used the saw and the knife to cut away at the flesh while biting down on a back scratcher to help him withstand the pain . As the pain in Zheng's leg increased, he grabbed the saw and fruit knife and performed the amputation himself . Zheng Yanliang points to the wrapped up remains of his leg that he disposed of with the rest of his rubbish . He said: 'I had a wooden back scratcher, I wrapped a towel around it, . and bit on it so I did not scream and wake my wife, then I used the . knife to slice the skin and pull it back so I could see the bone. Then I . used the saw to slice through the bone after putting a belt around the . leg to stop the blood flow. 'I did not want to distress my wife, but I had to wake her when the hacksaw blade broke.' More than 20 minutes later, his wife awoke and found him with his right leg amputated. Her husband’s right leg had been sawed off about 15 centimeters from the hip, and the metal saw used for the amputation had snapped into two from the excessive force, and on the table were 4 molars that had been bitten off. Fortunately, because of the thrombosis, there wasn’t much blood during the amputation. Painful: Mr Yanliag's leg was severed about 15centimetres from his hip . Wheelchair-bound: Farmer Mr Yanliang is uable to work since the loss of his limb. He said medication he was given did not help . Farm: Up until his illness, Mr Yanliang ran the family farm . The operation saved his life, but now the open wound that still shows a stump of bone has led to a fresh infection, this time in his left leg. Doctors say he will not be able to save his remaining foot - and he needs an operation if he is not to lose the entire left leg. As Zheng's condition worsens, Zheng's wife, who suffers from diabetes and heart disease, is forced to tend to the farm on her own. The family's only financial support comes from their 17-year-old daughter, who dropped out of school to take a job. Mr Yanliang is now asking his community . to help pay for an artificial limb, so that he can carry on with his . life and take care of his family. The local reporter who covered the story has opened a phone line for donations from readers. Treatment: Zheng Yanliang (right) now faces an uncertain future and needs to raise more money for another operation . Struggle: Mr Yanliang's wife, who has her own health problems, is tending to their farm. The family's only financial support comes from their 17-year-old daughter who dropped out of school to help her parents .","Zheng Yanliang was suffering from massive arterial thrombosis .

"By . Chris Johnson . Updated: . 03:43 EST, 23 February 2012 . A photograph apparently showing Whitney Houston in an open coffin has been published on the cover of the National Enquirer. The . chilling picture shows the singer lying dead in her golden casket, clad . in a regal purple dress and wearing what looks like a diamond brooch . and earrings. The weekly American magazine has run the snap alongside a bold headline proclaiming: 'Whitney: The last photo!' Controversial: The National Enquirer has . published a photograph on the cover of today issue, apparently showing . Whitney Houston dead in her coffin . Icon: Houston, pictured in February last year in LA . It is understood the photograph was taken inside the Whigham Funeral Home in Newark, New Jersey, where her family attended a private wake last Friday on the eve of her funeral. The magazine claims the photo was taken at the private viewing - although does not reveal who took the picture. Carolyn Whigham, the owner of the Whigham . Funeral Home, told MailOnline when asked for a comment: 'I have spoken . with the family about this and they have asked me not to comment on the . matter.' Whitney - who died aged 48 on February 11 - was wearing jewels worth $500,000 and had gold slippers on her feet, according to the publication. The image - which was published in today's edition - has stirred a strong reaction on Twitter, with people expressing their shock. '#wrong #rip,' wrote one Twitter user named as The Bitter Critter. Another user of the social networking site, Eric S Pittman, simply exclaimed 'Oh dear' while tweeter Peter Anthony Holder wrote: 'No privacy for Whitney, even in death. As usual, the National Enquirer is a piece of work.' The singer's funeral took place on Saturday and was attended by stars including Mariah Carey, Oprah Winfrey and her co-star from The Bodyguard, Kevin Costner. The star's on-off boyfriend Ray J was also in attendance. Houston was laid to rest the following day in a burial service attended by close family and friends. She was found dead in the bathtub of her fourth-floor hotel suite at the Beverly Hilton hotel on the eve of the Grammy Awards. Send off: Pallbearers carry the casket out of the New Hope Baptist Church on Saturday after the singer's funeral . Mourning her loss: Whitney's coffin is carried out of the church, as her mother Cissy walked behind . The official cause of death is yet to be revealed, pending the release of toxicology reports - which could still be several weeks off. However, there has been speculation that the troubled star - who endured a long battle with drugs - died as a result of a deadly concoction of prescriptions drugs and alcohol. Yesterday, RadarOnline reported Whitney had a mixture of Valium, Xanax and alcohol in her system when she was found at the Beverly Hilton. Shock: People have taken to Twitter to express their dismay at the magazine publishing the photo . 'Whitney had taken Valium, Xanax, and alcohol, which led to her death,' a source close to the situation told the website. 'The coroner is waiting on final . toxicology results to determine which one of the three was the major . contributing factor of her demise.' The insider went on: 'The coroner will . be closely examining Whitney's blood alcohol content at the time she . died as well. The sedatives and alcohol will almost certainly be the . cause of death, and not drowning. Troubled: Whitney's daughter Bobbi Kristina pictured arriving for the wake last Friday . 'Her heart stopped beating because her . respiratory system was suppressed because of the anti-anxiety meds, and . combined with the booze it probably happened very quickly before she . was found partially submerged in the bathtub.' Meanwhile, Whitney's daughter Bobbi-Kristina is said to be struggling to cope in the wake of her mother's death. Radar reported yesterday the 18-year-old was 'wasted' and appeared 'disconnected' at Sunday's burial - claims which were later vehemently denied by a representative for the Houston Estate. Her family - including father Bobby Brown - are also apparently keen for the teenager to go to rehab to seek treatment for her own alleged issues with alcohol and drugs. A source told the website: 'Krissy has taken her mother’s death . really hard, not surprisingly, and Bobby is terrified she’s going to do . something stupid. 'He wants her in a treatment centre, getting . professional help to get her through the grieving process without . falling back on alcohol or drugs to mask her pain.' The Enquirer published a post-mortem photo of John Lennon on its cover back in 1980 and also one of Elvis in his coffin in 1977. Feeling better? Aretha Franklin who cancelled her performance at Whitney's wake was seen out and about in New York on Wednesday .","Twitter backlash against tabloid for publishing controversial image .

"By . Ian Drury . The 3,500 servicemen now drafted in to bolster security during London 2012 will be forced to camp in disused buildings. Derelict schools, warehouses, factories and hospitals near the Olympic Park could be commandeered to give them somewhere to sleep. Many personnel – some only just back from gruelling tours on the Afghan front line – have been ordered to cancel home leave or holidays with their friends and families. About 1,000 will be flown in from Germany. A soldier on duty at the Olympic park in Stratford on Thursday. He'll soon be joined by 3,500 other troops . They will join 13,500 soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines already deployed to protect the Olympics against a terrorist atrocity. The 17,000 force is greater than that fighting the Taliban. And the decision to fill the shortfall of civilian guards left by G4S has left a massive headache for defence chiefs who have to find temporary accommodation for them all. Some will camp in a tented ‘city’ within London. It is understood camps will be erected inside Wellington Barracks near St James’s Park and at the Royal Artillery base at Woolwich. But a Whitehall source said the ‘favoured option’ was to find disused buildings large enough to house vast numbers of troops. ‘We are looking at industrial buildings, disused office blocks, disused schools. That is the most likely option. The conditions will be pretty austere but troops are more than used to making the best out of spartan conditions.’ Home Secretary Theresa May was forced to plead with The Ministry of Defence for help with security during the Olympic Games . To add insult to injury, Home Secretary Theresa May rewarded troops who have had leave cancelled with tickets to the dress rehearsal of the opening and closing ceremonies. She was criticised for failing to allow servicemen and women who were bailing her out to watch the real thing while MPs get free tickets for the blue riband 100 metres final. Around 5,000 extra tickets were made available for the practices, making a total of 7,000. One serving military officer said: ‘A lot of soldiers have had to cancel well-earned holidays with their loved ones to help dig Theresa May and the Olympics organisers out of this fiasco. It’s a bit condescending to say to them, “Here are some tickets to thank you – but, sorry, they’re not for the proper opening and closing ceremonies.” It’s insulting. I wonder how many MPs will be watching the dress rehearsals and how many will be watching the real thing.’ The Government has already announced 10,000 tickets are available for the Armed Forces under the Tickets For Troops scheme. Among the soldiers called up to rescue Olympic security are those serving with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, the 5th Battalion the Royal Regiment of Scotland, which was axed as a fighting force just days ago in defence cuts. Soldiers begin installing a battery of surface-to-air missiles on the roof of the Fred Wigg Tower council block in Leytonstone, East London, to protect against an Olympic terror attack from the sky . The men of the 131-year-old unit are already reeling from the demoralising news that it will be reduced next year to ceremonial duties. Personnel who had already been allocated to the Games were to do 12-hour shifts on six-day cycles for three months, with one day a week off. Many of the jobs involve checking bags, tickets and vehicles. Defence Secretary Philip  Hammond said: ‘Ministers across government recognise the burden that this additional short-notice deployment will impose upon  servicemen and women and their families, especially over the summer holiday season. ‘We will ensure that all those  taking part receive their full leave entitlement, that no one is out of pocket due to cancelled personal arrangements and that all deployed personnel are appropriately supported.’","Disused schools and warehouses could be commandeered .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Japanese police have arrested a factory worker accused of lacing frozen meals with pesticide, poisoning thousands of customers and leading to 6 million products being recalled. Police on Sunday identified the suspect as Toshiki Abe, 49, a worker at Aqlifoods. Abe was arrested Saturday and has denied the charges, police said. As many as 2,800 people across Japan may . have been affected by the tainted food, which includes pizzas, croquettes and . pancakes manufactured at the plant in Gunma prefecture, north of Tokyo. Toshiki Abe, 49, a factory worker, has been arrested on suspicion of lacing frozen foods with pesticide . Today Abe appeared at the Ota police office in Gunma prefecture, north of Tokyo, as he was sent to the prosecutor's office. Abe is suspected of lacing the food with the pesticide malathion four times in October. The chemical was found in his possession, according to Kyodo News service. The scandal has lead to the resignation of the president of Aqulifoods, as well as Toshio Kushiro, the president of its parent company Maruha Nichiro Inc. The company has also announced executive pay cuts in order to apologise to customers. The manufacturer has repeatedly said sorry and bought full-page . ads in major newspapers to warn people not to eat any of the tainted food. Up to 2,800 customers may have been affected by the poison, which can be lethal in high doses . Malathion, used in farming and gardening, can cause death in high concentrations, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. No life-threatening illnesses from Maruha's products have been reported, but public trust in food safety has been badly shaken.

"By . Associated Press . Some residents of a predominantly white New Hampshire town are upset with racist remarks they say a police commissioner has made about President Barack Obama. Resident Jane O'Toole said she overheard Wolfeboro Police Commissioner Robert Copeland use a racial slur in describing Obama. In an email to her obtained by The Associated Press, Copeland acknowledged using the ‘N’ word in referring to the president and said he will not apologize. Scroll down for video . Robert Copeland (with the cane at left) called President Barack Obama a 'f***ing n*****' and is now refusing to apologize . Copeland is one of three members of the police commission, which hires, fires and disciplines officers and sets their salaries. O'Toole, who moved to Wolfeboro four . months ago, said she overheard Copeland use a racial slur to describe . Obama at a local restaurant March 6. She heard him say he hates turning on the television because every time he does, there's that 'f***ing n*****.' 'He sort of swung around and puffed up his chest and said, ""Yeah,""' she told the Concord Monitor. 'And I said, ""Not good, not good at all.""' On a mission: Jane O'Toole had lived in Wolfeboro for just a few months when she overheard a man she later identified as the police commissioner use the racial slur. She has since helped spearhead a campaign to get him fired . O'Toole said she didn't know Copeland . was the police commissioner until she returned to the restaurant the . next day and asked about him. She . wrote to the town manager in early April and he replied that he was . powerless to act. She then wrote to Copeland's two fellow police . commissioners. In an email response to her, Copeland included an excerpt . from an email he sent to his fellow commissioners acknowledging his . remark. He said in the . excerpt, ‘I believe I did use the 'N' word in reference to the current . occupant of the Whitehouse. For this, I do not apologize — he meets and . exceeds my criteria for such.’ He also wrote: ‘While I believe the . problems associated with minorities in this country are momentous, I am . not phobic.’ Wolfeboro Town Manager David Owen said Thursday that while he finds Copeland's comment ‘reprehensible,’ he and the board of selectmen have no authority to remove an elected official. Owen said he expects a large number of residents will call for Copeland's resignation at a police commission meeting, adding ‘more power to them.’ Copeland has declined to be interviewed. Commission Chairman Joseph Balboni Jr. told the Concord Monitor he doesn't plan to ask Copeland to resign. He said, ‘He's (Copeland) worked with a lot of blacks in his life ... He said some harsh words about Mr. Obama, and here we are. This woman, she's blowing it all out of proportion.’ Balboni said further that he had no plans to allow attending residents to speak their minds at Thursdays meeting. Failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney's vacation home is in the town of Wolfeboro, along Lake Winnipesaukee . Meanwhile, board of selectman chairwoman Linda Murray planned to attend the meeting despite being powerless to remove him, she said she supports action against Copeland. 'I feel Mrs. O’Toole did what was appropriate,' she said. 'She informed the public. There are people in the public who are coming out dismayed by the kind of language and disrespect for the president of the United States, and they are going to stand up.' About 20 African Americans live in Wolfeboro, a town of about 6,300 residents in the scenic Lakes Region, in the central part of New Hampshire. The town manager's office said none of the police department's 12 full-time officers is African American or a member of another minority.

"By . Steve Doughty . The state should encourage marriage and try harder to get couples to stay together while their children are young, ministers have been told. A drive to persuade couples to marry rather than simply live together would help combat high break-up rates among cohabitees, a report said. It also called for state spending to concentrate on families with young children, because this is the time when family relationships are under the greatest pressure and have the highest chance of breaking up. A push to persuade couples to marry rather than simply live together would help combat high break-up rates, a report will suggest today (library image) The recommendations were prepared by the Marriage Foundation think-tank in response to a call from Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith for ideas on how to keep families together. Mr Duncan Smith’s Family Stability Review is aimed at gathering information on how families are changing, which are most at risk of failing, and how the state can do more to keep them together. The Marriage Foundation, which was launched by High Court family judge Sir Paul Coleridge, said in the first published evidence to the review that the families most at risk are those of unmarried new parents. It said that cohabiting couples make up fewer than one in five parents, but half of all family breakdown. State spending should concentrate on families with young children who are under pressure, the Marriage Foundation added (library image) The foundation’s report added that half of all family breakdown happens before a couple’s child reaches its second birthday. It said that once couples reach the ten-year mark, outside factors seem to have very little influence on whether or not they stay together. Foundation spokesman Harry Benson said: ‘There is little point in the Government attempting to improve the stability of established marriages. Approximately as many married couples who stuck it out between 1960 and 1970 are still together as those who married in 2000 and made it to 2010, despite the many social and cultural changes in that period. Mr Duncan Smith¿s Family Stability Review is aimed at gathering information on how families are changing . ‘What we need to do instead is to encourage couples considering having a family to marry and then support them through the trouble-filled early stages. ‘If they can make their marriage work for ten years, their children will have an 80 per cent chance of their family staying together for good.’ Mr Benson said many object to state attempts to influence personal decisions, such as whether to marry. But at the least, he said, the Government should not discourage commitment. ‘Currently, there is a couple penalty on all partners who share a home,’ he said. ‘It can cost parents with one child up to £7,100 a year in lost tax credits the moment they move into together. ‘So the Government is incentivising couples not to commit. Meanwhile it is spending more than the entire defence budget on the costs of family breakdown, £46billion including court fees, child truancy, juvenile delinquency and related incidents of crime. ‘No less important is the unseen personal impact on the lives of our young people. The effects of family instability in early years continue to be felt decades later.’ He added: ‘It may be difficult politically to be seen to favour married couples, but the focus should be on children and giving parents incentives to create the most stable possible environment for bringing up their families.’ David Cameron has spoken regularly about encouraging marriage. But so far ministers have offered only a minor tax break, worth up to £200 a year, to lower income married couples.","Couples should be encouraged to marry rather than just live together .

"By . Mark Duell . Stuck in a deckchair: Des Badcock, 82, was enjoying an ice cream in his garden in Taunton when the canvas seat on his chair suddenly gave way . A grandfather has revealed how he was forced to call 999 after becoming stuck in his deckchair. Des Badcock, 82, who lives alone in Taunton, Somerset, was enjoying an ice cream in his garden when the canvas seat on his chair suddenly gave way. He fell onto the grass as the chair collapsed around him and left him stuck with his feet dangling in the air. Mr Badcock found himself trapped by his bottom in the metal frame. After more than half an hour in the glaring sunshine and with no-one around to help he pulled his mobile phone out of his pocket and called the fire brigade. Some 20 minutes later two firemen arrived at his garden and hauled him back to his feet. Grandfather-of-seven Mr Badcock, who was physically unhurt, said: ‘I was just sitting out in the garden in my deckchair after having an ice cream. It was a Cornetto from Lidl. ‘All of a sudden I went down and the chair was broken. I fell right through the chair and couldn't get out. My feet were suspended in the air. I live alone and the neighbours weren't in. ‘No matter what I did I couldn't get any purchase. I was there for half an hour. I thought “what am I going to do? I'm going to have to phone the fire brigade”. ‘I couldn't stay there much longer because I was starting to get sunburn. If I'd stuck around I would've been frazzled.’ Mr . Badcock, who has lived alone since his wife Margaret died five years . ago, added: ‘They took an arm each and heaved me out.

"By . Chris Stocks . England's Ravi Bopara has called for greater education of county players following the latest allegations of corruption to hit the domestic game. Three county matches are being investigated by the International Cricket Council’s anti-corruption unit as part of a wide-ranging probe based on evidence from former New Zealand batsman Lou Vincent. They are looking at two games from Vincent’s time at Sussex in 2011 — a T20 and a 40-over contest — plus another T20 he played for Lancashire in 2008. Advice: Essex and England batsman Ravi Bopara believes county players need greater education on match-fixing . The revelations overshadowed the much-publicised launch of the revamped domestic T20 tournament, the NatWest Blast. Bopara has painful memories of the last major scandal to rock English county cricket, when Essex team-mates Mervyn Westfield and Danish Kaneria were found guilty of spot-fixing during a limited-overs match against Durham in 2009. He said: ‘Nobody wants this, it’s a beautiful game. The last thing we want to do is put fans off. We want to keep this game as clean as possible and keep the fans enjoying it. It’s a horrible place to be when the fans are questioning everything.’ Allegations: Ex-New Zealand and Sussex batsman Lou Vincent says six players have been involved in fixing in county cricket . Several Essex players heard Kaneria talking about fixing in the dressing room during his time at the club but discounted it as ‘banter’. Now Bopara has urged cricket’s authorities to step up their anti-corruption education programmes to ensure similar incidents do not occur in the future. ‘I certainly know what to do,’ he said. ‘I’ve been briefed quite a bit with England. Speaking out: Bopara was giving his opinion on match-fixing and how the game can combat the problem . ‘I think it could be drummed into county cricket a bit more just how important it actually is to report it if something is dodgy. You have to report it— that’s key.’ Bopara also backed calls from England team-mate Ian Bell to ban communication devices from dressing rooms during televised county games. The practice is standard for international fixtures and Bopara, speaking after Essex’s eight-wicket victory against Middlesex in the first match of a T20 double-header at Lord’s, said: ‘You don’t need to speak to anyone for half a day.

Two more men have been arrested in connection with the Holly Bobo case, the Tennessee nursing student - and cousin of country singer Whitney Duncan - who went missing on the morning of April 2011.

The brothers were arrested on May 29 and both men are expected in court on Wednesday morning for their arraignments. Scroll down for video . Two more men have been arrested in connection with the Holly Bobo case, the Tennessee nursing student who went missing on the morning of April 2011 . Jeffrey Pearcy, left, and Mark Pearcy, right, have both been charged with accessory after the fact and tampering with evidence . According to the affidavit for Jeffery Pearcy, investigators believe he has 'shown a visual recording on an electronic device to an individual. 'According to the witness, this visual recording shows information that will prove to be beneficial in the prosecution of a current on-going investigation being conducted by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation.' The affidavit doesn’t mention if the charges are in relation to the Bobo case, reports the Jacksonsun.com. Investigators believe that Jeffrey Pearcy has possession or has knowledge of where the video is, according to the affidavit. The affidavit states that Jeffrey Pearcy is an 'accessory after the fact due to his conduct concerning the concealment of evidence into the investigation.' Tampering with evidence is a Class C Felony and accessory after the fact is a Class E Felony. Suspect: Jason Wayne Autry has been charged with the kidnap and murder of Holly Bobo . Loss: Nursing student Holly Bobo was seen being led from her Tennessee home in April 2011 . Threats: Adams appears in court earlier this year over claims he threatened his brother, who is a witness in the case . A . TBI spokesperson said in a statement, ‘…out of respect for the judicial . process, we cannot speak to the particular possible pieces of evidence . in this case. We continue our work to follow the leads wherever they . might lead. We won’t stop until we find a sense of justice and closure . for the family and friends of Holly Bobo.’ Jeffrey Pearcy, 42, is currently being held in Henderson County without bond. Mark Pearcy was transferred from Decatur County to Carroll County last week and is also being held without bond. He was . also charged with failing to register as a sex offender and unlawful . possession of a weapon. According to online records, Mark Pearcy registered as a sex offender in 2000 for statutory rape. The arrests are the latest development since Jason Wayne Autry became the second man to be charged with the murder and kidnapping of the missing student, who was last seen by her brother being led into woods at their home. Connection: Autry, who is currently serving a three-year sentence for aggravated assault, is described as a long-time friend of Adams . Autry, 39, is a longtime friend of Zachary Adams, who was also charged with her kidnap and murder in March. Tennesse Bureau of Investigation director Mark Gwyn said they have sworn statements from witnesses who claim to have seen Miss Bobo alive with Autry and Adams after she had been reported missing. He added that they also had physical evidence being analyzed at two crime laboratories, and several witnesses. 'We believe other individuals have knowledge, and possibly others have involvement,' Mr Gwyn told News Channel 5. 'They can expect us to be on their doorsteps very soon.' He added: 'This is a case the TBI has been continuously working hard to solve now for three years. It has not been easy but I do know truth will prevail.' Charged: Zachary Adams, left, and Jason Wayne Autry, right, are suspected of kidnapping and killing Holly Bobo . 'Anyone who had anything to do with Holly's disappearance will be brought to justice,' he added. The first major break in the case came in February, when the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation agents and FBI searched several areas around Decatur, including the home of Zachary Adams. Adams, 29, was arrested and charged with kidnapping and murder shortly afterwards. Miss Bobo's body has never been found. Adams appeared in court in April on charges of coercion of a witness after allegedly making threats to his brother who is due to testify against him. Adams' brother allegedly told the FBI he had seen Miss Bobo, 20, alive at his home after she was reported missing. Heartbroken: Holly's mom Karen Bobo is led into court by attorney Steve Farase in March, when Adams was charged with her murder and kidnap . Adams is accused of asking a fellow inmate to tell his brother: 'He's the one who started this s*** and if he don't shut his mouth he will be in the hole beside her,' CBS News reported. Autry, 39, has been indicted with especially aggravated kidnapping and first-degree felony murder. He is already in prison serving a three-year sentence for aggravated assault. The case about Miss Bobo's disappearance is still active. Prosecutors are considering seeking the death penalty if they get a conviction in the case.","Brothers Jeffrey and Mark Pearcy have been charged with accessory after the fact and tampering with evidence .

"By . Sally Lee . Meet eight-month-old Hurley who was born a deaf dog. But his hearing impairment has proved to be no barrier for this intelligent pooch, having learnt to respond to commands in sign language since February with the help of trainers like Adam Farrugia. Sadly the friendly canine is in need of some TLC as he's been without a proper home since January, which is when his previous owner surrendered him to Australian animal welfare group RSPCA. Scroll down for video . Eight-month-old Hurley, a Great Dane cross mastiff, was born a deaf dog. He's been under the care of the RSPCA since January . The pooch has learnt to respond to commands in sign language since February with the help of trainers like Adam Farrugia (right) 'So far he's learnt how to respond to sit, drop and walk,' the education and training officer said. 'The other dog at his previous home wasn't comfortable living together so his owner gave him away. 'After he was with us for a few weeks, we realised that that he wasn't responding to us and that's when we figured that he was deaf.' But Hurley's case isn't an unusual one for the RSPCA as their Sydney shelter, located in Yagoona, sees an average of four deaf dogs come through each year. The RSPCA receives about a dozen deaf dogs across its nine NSW shelters each year.

Mr Farrugia said the owner needs to have a clear understanding of a deaf dog's needs . 'We teach each dog similar but varied simple hand signals as their understanding depends on their intelligence level,' Mr Farrugia said. The 35-year-old said deafness is a common trait among dogs like Hurley as their white coat is linked to a genetic disorder which lacks pigment-producing cells in their inner ears. Mr Farrugia said Hurley can be a great new addition to a family with an experienced dog owner. 'Hurley is an affectionate but he's a big boy so he should be raised in a calm environment with children over the age of 15,' he said.

"By . Freya Noble . Of all the kangaroos who live at Josephine's Kangaroo Orphanage in Coober Pedy, Bella is by far the most affectionate. But when Josephine Brennan-Kuss noticed the big red licking and nuzzling certain spots on her body, she didn't realise the six-year-old was trying to get a message across. 'I'd been meaning to get them checked for ages, and I just kept forgetting,' Josephine told the MailOnline, talking about some small lesions which she had come across a month or so earlier. Josephine Brennan-Kuss had her life saved by her kangaroo Bella after she sniffed out cancerous spots on her face and body. She is pictured caring for a new arrival at the orphanage . 'She concentrated on these spots, one on my hand, one on my foot and one on my face. 'She was on a mission to tell me something.' When Josephine finally took notice of Bella, saw a doctor and got the spots checked out, she couldn't believe what the kangaroo had alerted her to. She had three cancerous spots removed from the places on her body Bella had been paying attention to, and an additional spot biopsied on her face. Bella, a six-year-old red kangaroo, paid special attention to spots on Josephine's face and body which led to her having them checked out and removed . The 63-year-old was lucky to catch the Basel cell carcinomas when she did, left any longer and they could have turned much nastier. 'They're non-aggressive but still need to be removed. They start eating your flesh away if you leave them,' Josephine revealed. The 63-year-old had one spot removed and another biopsied on her face, and will undergo surgery in July to completely remove all the cancers . 'I've heard of people who had one on their ear and had to have half their ear removed.' Though she still needs to undergo surgery in July to completely remove the lesions, the wildlife carer is amazed that Bella, who has been at her and husband Terry's orphanage since she was a joey, was able to detect the cancer. 'We're still in awe ourselves - because if it hadn't been for Bella I wouldn't have got it checked out.' However, this is not the first time Bella has saved a life. Three and a half years ago, Terry had a series of strokes. During that time Josephine said Bella, who is normally a 'mummy's girl', paid more attention than usual to her husband. Big red kangaroos are the most common species in the Coober Pedy area, where Josephine and Terry run their own art gallery and wildlife orphanage. 'They're big sooks, they're very affectionate, very calm, such a lovely temperament,' Josephine revealed. '[But] prior to him having the strokes we noticed that Bella was paying him so much attention, was being a real daddy's girl. 'She was licking his arm, lay down next to him. But we didn't put two and two together. The kangaroo orphanage mostly takes in joeys whose mothers have been hunted or died in road accidents . Josephine (left) and Terry (right) have been caring for wildlife for many years, and opened up their current refuge in 2007 . As it turned out, Terry was very unwell and Bella had sensed a small stroke which was then followed by a larger one. 'Some people who suffer from epilepsy have dogs that alert them when they're going to have a seizure, maybe it's like that,' Josephine said. 'I don't even know that they smell it, I think that they sense.' Speaking of Bella's discovery, the wildlife lover admitted that her and Terry would certainly be paying greater attention to the kangaroo's intuition from now on. 'We'll probably be walking on eggshells every time one of them gives us a kiss or cuddle,' she joked. 'Bella's living up to her name - she is certainly beautiful.' Bella is one of the most affectionate kangaroos, but also very cheeky, seen her napping in a pile of washing she messed up .","Josephine Brennan-Kuss had four skin cancers removed after her kangaroo Bella detected them .

"By . Kerry Mcdermott . The love story behind these dazzling jewels could have inspired the plot of the much-loved musical The King and I. The breathtaking necklace, bracelets and ring were given to English teen Ceril Heycock by her husband Prince Bira of Siam as birthday gifts after they wed in 1937. Many of the pieces the British-educated prince lavished on his young bride are adorned with opals - Ceril's birth stone. Real-life King and I: A model shows off some of the jewels given by a young Siamese prince to his English wife in a love story that echoes the plot of the much-loved musical . From English rose to Thai princess: Prince and Princess Birabongse are seen on a visit to Siam - now Thailand - during the 1930s . The impressive collection of jewels - which Ceril wore until her death in 2010 - is expected to fetch as much as £60,000 at auction tomorrow. After their wedding in 1937 Ceril, then 17, and her royal husband - a world-famous racing car driver - moved to Cornwall. Exquisite: The collection is expected to fetch up to £60,000 at auction . After Bira was given the collection - made up of two brooches, four bracelets, a necklace and a ring adorned with opals, diamonds and pearls - by his cousin Chula, he gave the pieces to his young bride as gifts. Tradition dictated that Ceril could not dispose of the jewels during Chula's lifetime. The glamorous couple, who met at art school, divorced in 1949, and Prince Bira went on to marry a further three times. But the pair are understood to have remained in contact, and the prince is said to have finally reunited with his first true love in 1983. Ceril wore Bira's gifts throughout her life. The bond between the Thai prince and the young English woman echoes the plot of the classic musical The King and I. The acclaimed film, starring Yul Brynner and Deborah Kerr, tells the tale of the unspoken love between the King of Siam and English governess Ann Leonowens. Siam was renamed Thailand in 1939. Ceril's family inherited the collection of jewellery upon her death, and the pieces are set to go under the hammer tomorrow. The pieces, which date back to the late . 19th and early 20th century, are expected to fetch tens of thousands according to auction house Sothebys. Justin . Roberts, specialist at Sothebys, said: 'Ceril was an English lady who . married Bira Prince of Siam in 1937 and they lived in Cornwall during . the war. 'As he was higher up in the royal hierarchy, Bira’s cousin Chula would give him an allowance regularly. 'Chula . inherited opal jewels from his mother after her death and he gave them . to Bira, who then gave them to Ceril as her birthday was in October, of . which opal is the birthstone. “Chula . also gave Bira a loose diamond which he had made into an engagement . ring, we believe by Cartier in London, and a variety of other jewels as . was tradition. “It’s . unusual to have jewellery with such lovely provenance and what is also . interesting is that Ceril was not allowed to dispose of them in Chula’s . lifetime,' Mr Roberts said. 'After Chula . died Ceril kept hold of the jewels but after her death the . jewels were passed down through her family, who have now decided to sell . them.' Bira was a high profile racing car driver who took part in Formula One and Grand . Prix competitions. Echoes: The popular musical told the tale of the King of Siam, played by Yul Brynner, and English governess Anna Leonowens, played by Deborah Kerr . The Eton and Cambridge University-educated prince won the Monaco Grand Prix just a year before . marrying Ceril. He died from heart failure on December 23, 1985, in Barons Court station in west London aged 71. The auction is due to take place tomorrow.

"By . Brian Mahoney, Ap . Andrew Wiggins of Kansas was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the No 1 pick in the 2014 NBA draft on Thursday night. The Cavs went for a freshman from Canada to open the draft for the second straight year and will hope Wiggins works out better than Anthony Bennett. Bennett was injured last summer, came into the season out of shape and made no impact, one of the reasons the Cavs were back in this spot again. Top dog: Andrew Wiggins poses with . NBA Commissioner Adam Silver after being picked No 1 by Cleveland . Up in lights: The pick means it is the second year Cleveland have selected a Canadian with the top selection . VIDEO No.1 pick Wiggins to the Cavs . But Wiggins seems a much more ready product after averaging a Kansas freshman-record 17.1 points. He might have ended up as the top pick anyway, but became the best option for the Cavs when Jayhawks teammate Joel Embiid suffered a stress fracture in his right foot shortly before the draft. Wearing a black tuxedo jacket with a white floral pattern, the guard slipped on a maroon Cleveland hat, hugged his supporters and went on stage to shake hands with Commissioner Adam Silver, who was calling the first round for the first time since replacing David Stern. Milwaukee followed with another freshman, Duke forward Jabari Parker, who on Wednesday disputed that he was out of shape for his workout with Cleveland and performed poorly. Wanted: Jabari Parker was selected as second pick by the Milwaukee Bucks . Side by side: Wiggins and Parker stop for interviews after being drafted to the NBA . Embiid went third to Philadelphia, drawing loud cheers from the many red-and-blue dressed 76ers fans who made the trip to Barclays Center in Brooklyn, as well as from Philadelphia guard Michael Carter-Williams, last season's Rookie of the Year who was sitting on the arena floor level. The 76ers had two top-10 picks and could afford to take a chance on Embiid, the big man who may have ended up the top prize despite his lone season at Kansas ending early because of a bad back. But once the foot injury popped up during workouts, leaving his NBA debut uncertain after surgery, the two teams at the top passed. Arizona forward Aaron Gordon went fourth to Orlando, which also had two picks in the lottery. 1. Cleveland, Andrew Wiggins, g, Kansas.2. Milwaukee, Jabari Parker, f, Duke.3.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The man who bought a winning, $70 million lottery ticket in San Francisco has stepped forward to claim his prize. California Lottery officials identified the winner on Wednesday as 41-year-old Eurico Chin. They say Chin bought the ticket on a whim at a Safeway in the city's Sunset District while out walking last month. Big winner: The winner of California's $70 million lottery payout has been identified as 41-year-old Eurico Chin . 'I thought to myself, ""why not?’” he said, according to a press release . from the California Lottery. 'I’m already here, might as well buy one.' His ticket matched all six winning numbers for the SuperLotto Plus jackpot. Lottery officials say he is not interested in doing media interviews. Chin told lottery officials he learned he had won the day after the May 24 draw. 'I was watching the news and I saw that the winner was on Noriega . (Street) and I remembered that I bought the ticket on Noriega,' he said. 'I thought to myself, ""Well, it might be . me.’” Even though he knew he'd won, he to claim his prize so he could conduct research and create a plan for the money. 'You have to plan carefully about what to do with the money,' he said in the statement. Other winner: The Safeway where Chin bought the ticket (pictured) will get $350,000 for selling Chin the winning ticket . Chin is now deciding whether to take a lump-sum payment, which Lottery officials estimate to be about $41 million before taxes, or to take the annuity option, which would allow him to collect the full winnings over the course of 30 years. Chin's strategy for the money, according to the press release, is to invest the majority of the winnings and then maybe also buy a new car and a house. Chin, who currently is not working, says he will most likely retire now that he is a multi-millionaire. The Safeway that sold Chin the ticket also will receive $350,000 for selling the winning ticket.","Lottery officials have identified the winner as 41-year-old Eurico Chin .

"By . Sam Webb . George Galloway's former parliamentary secretary today pleaded guilty to encouraging her anti-terror police officer husband to access confidential Scotland Yard emails. Aisha Ali-Khan, 33, who worked with the Respect MP, admitted the charge during a brief hearing at London’s Southwark Crown Court. Her husband, former detective inspector Mohammed Afiz Khan, 46, who was head of the Muslim contact unit at the Metropolitan Police’s counter-terrorism unit SO15, has already pleaded guilty to two misconduct charges. The pair, of Keighley, West Yorkshire, were told they will be sentenced together on July 11. Aisha Ali-Khan, the ex-parliamentary secretary to firebrand MP George Galloway, admitted encouraging her ex-police officer husband Mohammed Azif Khan to access confidential emails today . The maximum penalty Ali-Khan can receive is a fine but her husband could face jail. Ali-Khan today admitted that on or about August 24 2012 she encouraged Khan to obtain personal data relating to people she believed had sent emails. She previously pleaded not guilty to a second charge of encouraging misconduct in a public office. Khan was originally charged with two counts of misconduct in a public office and four counts of data protection offences between May and September 2012. In December he pleaded guilty to a charge of misconduct in that he disclosed restricted information he had obtained relating to the arrest of radical Muslim cleric Anjem Choudary to Ali-Khan while she was employed by Mr Galloway on or around May 22 2012. The offences took place while Ali-Khan was employed by George Galloway . At the time, Mr Galloway said Ali-Khan was an 'agent' of the Metropolitan police and her activities were 'a direct attack on not just me but on democracy'. Khan also admitted a charge of misconduct relating to obtaining CCTV from South Yorkshire Police that he had no authority or good reason to obtain between March 16 and April 30 2012. Khan pleaded not guilty to two data protection charges but did not enter pleas to the other two. He was suspended from the Met after being charged in July last year and has now been dismissed.The pair were both given bail and declined to comment as they left the court. A Met Police spokesman previously said their arrests came as a result of an investigation by the directorate of professional standards into a complaint from a member of the public about the actions of the officer. In December Khan pleaded guilty to a charge of misconduct in that he disclosed restricted information he had obtained relating to the arrest of radical Muslim cleric Anjem Choudary . Ali-Khan was the victim of internet trolls following her arrest, an earlier hearing was told. During an unsuccessful application to have her address withheld her lawyer Rachel Sewell told Westminster Magistrates Court that her client had received abuse online and in texts. She told the court: 'These texts have incited violence primarily as a result of this set of proceedings. 'Nothing has physically happened but she has received messages to that effect. 'She has received a great deal of abuse online and has shown me a series of messages and extracts from blogs, one in particular called Topix, where a great number of people have said a number of things about her.' Releasing them both on bail, Judge Alistair McCreath said: 'I must sentence both of you together on the same occasion and the convenient and earliest occasion I can do it on appears to be July 11. 'So I will bail you to return to court on that date.'","Aisha Ali-Khan admitted asking police officer husband to obtain secret data .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Nine-year-old Keat Rhodes looks just like any other little girl - but she was actually born male. The schoolgirl was only seven years old when she was diagnosed with gender identity disorder and began her transition from boy to girl. Since then she has undergone an incredible transformation with the support of her adoptive parents Emily and Clint LeVan, from Ohio. Scroll down for video . Keat Rhodes, 9, was born male and was only seven years old when she was diagnosed with gender identity disorder and began her transition from boy to girl . And over the next few years, Keat, who has a younger brother, Blaine, seven, will undergo treatment to complete her transition from male to female. Today Keat is the picture of happiness but it hasn't been easy and the family has endured a huge backlash from parents in their community. Made the subject of a Facebook hate campaign, they were accused of child abuse. Some even suggested Emily was turning Keat in to a Barbie doll. But they have fought the bullies and are striving to give their daughter a normal life. Since she was diagnosed Keat (left), born Keating (right) has undergone an incredible transformation with the support of her adoptive parents and is happier than ever . Keat, pictured with her younger brother Blaine, 7, and her adoptive parents Emily, 36, and Clint, 41, LeVan, has been made the subject of a Facebook hate campaign but the family are determined that she'll live a normal life . Full-time mother Emily, 36, said: 'When Keat came into our lives, he was a four-year-old boy called Keaton. 'But we noticed very early on that he was different to his brother. 'While Blaine preferred playing with trucks and cars, Keat liked dolls. At school he liked playing dress up with the princess dresses.' She added: 'Clint and I weren't bothered by the toys either of the boys played with, as long as they were happy.' At a young age, Keat began drawing himself as a female and also confided in his parents, as well as school teachers, that he was a girl.' Her parents explained that while her brother Blaine preferred playing with trucks and cars, Keat, pictured, right, with her adoptive father, liked dolls and playing dress up with the princess dresses . At a young age, Keat, pictured with seven-year-old brother Blaine, began drawing himself as a female and also confided in his parents, as well as school teachers, that he was a girl . Emily said: 'At first we thought she was messing around. We thought it was a phase and we sort of laughed it off. 'But when she began talking about it with people outside the house we realised it was serious. 'At the time I was a little scared for him because I didn't really know a lot about transgender people and I didn't know what would happen to him or us if he became a girl. 'We live in a very small town in one of the poorest counties in Ohio - no-one in our community had probably ever heard of transgender people either. 'And a lot of people aren't that accepting of people who are different.' Clint and Emily took Keat to see their family doctor and were then referred to a therapist as well as a psychiatrist, who both diagnosed gender identity disorder . Grocery store manager Clint, 41, and Emily took Keat to see their family doctor and were then referred to a therapist as well as a psychiatrist, who both diagnosed gender identity disorder. Emily said: 'It seemed strange that a child so young would be so sure about something like this but all the experts said Keat was ""unwavering, consistent and persistent"". 'And after doing a lot of research we decided it was right to let him live socially as a girl.' Keat's transition began during a break for the summer holiday at school. During the two-month period, Clint and Emily changed their son's name by deed poll and they took her shopping for more feminine clothes to wear. Emily said: 'Keat was so happy in her skin but I dreaded that first day back at school where she would be going back to class with pigtails and a pink backpack. 'She was the first in the school district to have transitioned so I knew there would be some confusion. 'But the teachers were supportive - they explained everything to the pupils and, incredibly, they were very accepting. 'The backlash actually came from some family and friends - Clint's dad couldn't accept Keat and my mum struggled before she eventually came to terms with it. 'We lost friends and we also started getting a lot of abuse on Facebook from parents in the community. 'People were saying it was child abuse. One dad even said he was going to ""beat the boy back in to Keat"". 'Some mums said I had a doll complex and I was trying to create a real life Barbie. I just sat in front of my computer and cried because I couldn't believe that these people were saying these hateful things.' Keat's parents explain how they lost friends and started getting a lot of abuse on Facebook from parents in the community . Keat before her transition (right) seen posing here with brother Blaine (left) in 2009 . Despite all the negative comments, Clint and Emily say they had support from their local church and an online community of parents with transgender children. They were also inundated with messages from others telling them to fight on. Today they are focusing on Keat's future. In November this year she will have her first appointment with an endocrinologist to discuss testosterone blockers, which she will begin when she starts puberty. At 15, she will have counselling to determine if she is ready to start hormone therapy, which will allow her to develop breast tissue but will make her infertile.

By the age of 18, she will be eligible for full gender reassignment surgery. Emily said: 'Thinking of what lies ahead, I do have my fears. I am worried she will be bullied and face prejudice. I also know there is a high suicide risk among transgender people. 'But I hope that with our love she will grow up to have a normal life. 'It just comes down to love and if you love your child then you should do anything in the world for them. It's a simple and pure as that.' Age 15 she will have counselling to determine if she is ready to start hormone therapy, which will allow her to develop breast tissue but will make her infertile . Gender identity disorder (GID) or transsexualism is defined by strong, persistent feelings of identification with the opposite gender and discomfort with one's own assigned sex. People with GID desire to live as members of the opposite sex and often dress and use mannerisms associated with the other gender. For instance, a person identified as a boy may feel and act like a girl. This is distinct from homosexuality in that homosexuals nearly always identify with their apparent sex or gender.

The BBC was last night at the centre of a row over political bias after it was revealed that the vice-chair of its governing trust is advising the Labour Party. Diane Coyle, deputy to chairman Chris Patten, is working as an aide to shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna – despite official guidance that warned her accepting the job could be inappropriate. Ms Coyle, an economist, is paid £77,005 to work two-and-a-half days a week for the BBC Trust. Inappropriate? Diane Coyle (left) is working as an aide to Chuka Umunna (right) On February 25 she informed trust director Nicholas Kroll that she had accepted the unpaid political job. But in an email written two days later, Phil Harrold, BBC Trust Head of Governance, which advises trust members on all matters relating to their jobs, told Mr Kroll: ‘This could potentially be a significant partisan political activity.’ Tory MP Philip Davies, a member of the Commons media select committee, said:‘I’m not a big fan of political appointments to the BBC. I voted against Chris Patten becoming BBC Trust chairman because I thought him an inappropriate choice and it is the same with his deputy.’ A BBC Trust spokesman said: ‘There is a clear, published code of practice in place which applies to all trustees.’","Diane Coyle is paid £77,005 to work two-and-a-half days a week ."
"By . Corey Charlton . Simple blood thinning drugs such as aspirin could be used to prevent repeated miscarriages, new research has revealed. Doctors have discovered blood thinning treatment can fix a faulty gene found in a high number of those who suffer from repeated miscarriages. A recent study showed it was present in 44 per cent of IVF patients, compared to only 15 per cent of the general population. Aspirin could be the key to treating the genetic problem and helping prevent repeated miscarriages . The blood thinning treatment now being used to fix the gene is said to be so effective it gives those carrying it an 'equal playing field with anyone else trying to conceive'. And those treated with the drugs, at IVF treatment provider Care Facility, were found to have a healthy baby birth rate of 38 per cent. Professor . Simon Fishel, Care Facility managing director, said the study was remarkable for a number of reasons. 'It's blood thinning treatment - it's a drug called heparin - possibly even aspirin, but we're studying that at the moment. 'Those . women who have had very poor prognosis . . . Can now have the chance of a . live birth similar to people who don't have this problem.' The gene variant, called C4/M2, creates difficulties for the embryo implanting in the womb. And remarkably, it can be passed on through both men or women. 'We studied . our IVF patients and found that 44 per cent of couples carried the . gene,' Prof Fishel said. 'This is the first time in the world where it has been found that a . man can carry a gene that can pass on miscarriage to a woman.'","Study found a faulty gene was present in 44 per cent of IVF patients compared with just 15 per cent of the general population .

The 44-year-old British track legend was accompanying the Queen’s Baton Relay on its journey around her home county of Kent today and insisted that excitement is building even now for the July showpiece event. While the Games may struggle to match the magic and magnitude of the London Olympics, double Olympic gold medallist Holmes insists that the combination of established stars like Mo Farah and the best of England’s young talent can still inspire the nation. Future: Dame Kelly Holmes believes a new generation of stars can come forward to Glasgow 2014 . Champion: Dame Kelly won two gold medals at the 2004 Athens Olympics in the 800m and 1500m . And, with Team England set to confirm their track and field squad on Monday, Holmes is optimistic about what she will witness at Hampden Park. ‘I won my first Commonwealth Games gold 20 years ago in Victoria,’ said the former 800m and 1500m specialist. 'I was sharing an apartment with Sally Gunnell. The year before, she had become world champion. The year before that, she had won Olympic gold. ‘So there I was - no one knowing who I was, still young in sport - and I’m sharing a room with an Olympic champion. It was incredible. ‘This is what I think will happen again, with the likes of Mo Farah, Tom Daley, all those people, in Glasgow. ‘Two years after Victoria, I was competing in an Olympics, where I came fourth. ‘I got the silver medal in 98 after injury in Kuala Lumpur, and then I won bronze at the Olympic Games in Sydney two years after that. Tour: Dame Kelly was in Kent where the Queen's Baton stopped as it travels around the British Isles . Venue: Hampden Park will be the main athletics stadium at the Glasgow Commonwealth Games . ‘I then won gold in Manchester prior to my double gold in Athens in 2004. So I’ve always had the Commonwealth Games as a massive part of my own development. ‘The atmosphere, the environment, the fact you’re with people from all different sports - that’s an education in itself. ‘It’s called the Friendly Games and it is as everyone pretty much speaks the same language – but it’s a friendly, competitive environment. ‘We’ll see some amazing events happen.’ But what of Team England’s chances of gold? Will the focus be on the likes of Olympic champions Farah and Greg Rutherford or could there be others to emerge as Holmes once did? ‘It will be a strong squad,’ said Holmes, now the president of Commonwealth Games England. ‘But the advantage of the Commonwealths, because of the breakdown of the Home Nations, is that it gives a lot more people the opportunity to participate. Glory: Dame Kelly says that stars such as double Olympic gold medallist Mo Farah can inspire youngsters . Experience: Olympic champions Tom Daley (left) and Greg Rutherford (right) can help the youngsters . ‘It will provide some of Team England’s up and coming talent with the chance to perform and make a breakthrough. ‘I’d won European silver (in the 1500m) in my first year as an international athlete in 1994 but no one really knew me. ‘Two weeks later, I won Commonwealth gold in Victoria and suddenly I was put on a completely different pedestal in terms of world-class sport. ‘And I think that’s what is going to happen in Glasgow for Team England - with some new stars born.’","Dame Kelly Holmes expects Glasgow 2014 to unearth new English talent .

A 13-year-old girl who was gang-raped by five men was left so traumatised by the ‘terrifying assault’ that she could not tell police or even her own mother for three years. The schoolgirl was attacked as she walked home through an alleyway and was dragged into a nearby field where she was assaulted. The five male attackers, who were all described as being between 25 and 35 years old, struck as the girl walked through the narrow path in Rayleigh, Essex, at around 9.30pm on February 24, 2011. However, the young . victim had kept a three-year silence about the attack before telling her mother who urged her to report the case to the . police.

"By . Steve Doughty . Warning: The former Archbishop of Canterbury claimed the Church is being swept up by political fashions . A former Archbishop of Canterbury yesterday warned the Church of England to stop ‘dancing to the world’s agenda’. Lord Carey said Anglicans needed to ‘get their house in order’- warning they risk break-up under the burden of trying to keep up with political fashions. The Archbishop spoke out as the CofE prepares for a fresh round of internal conflict over gay rights. He said in a sermon at Chester Cathedral that the Church is being ‘shaken by seismic shifts and changes as a result of disagreements on ministry, marriage and human sexuality’. Lord Carey said: ‘We must not allow ourselves to fracture under the colossal weight of dancing to the world’s agenda.’ Church of England leaders are vulnerable to the charge that they are willing to be flexible in the face of political pressure since the ignominious collapse of their efforts to appoint women bishops last year. After David Cameron warned that the Church needed a ‘sharp prod’, the CofE soft-pedalled its opposition to the Government’s plans for same-sex marriage. At the end of last year it published proposals to end the official ban that prevents clergy from conducting blessing services for same-sex couples. Lord Carey, an opponent of the gay rights lobby in the Church, said non-churchgoers recoil from the Church of England when they see infighting and division. He said that Church leaders should be concentrating on achieving unity rather than meeting the expectations of politics. He told the Daily Mail following his sermon: ‘What I’m talking about with the world’s agenda is what this Government has now set up,’ he said. ‘This puts pressure on the Church to offer rites of marriage to those who are in same-sex relationships,’ he said. ‘Obviously, I would disapprove of that - but the pressure is on so many churches to do that. ‘I am actually saying let’s keep our gaze on true unity, let’s share what we have in common, let’s not be so tempted to dance to the world’s tune that we forget that unity and mission are indissoluble, one affects the other.’ He added: ‘I think outsiders would say “you talk about reconciliation but it is an empty word if you are not reconciled yourselves so put your own house in order”.’ The former Archbishop added that the apathy shown by the Government to Christianity was sometimes ‘far worse than persecution’. Justin Welby has been struggling to repair damage caused by the failure to secure support for women bishops . The vote over gender equality in Church roles became an international discussion but new rules did not pass . ‘We live in very difficult times for the Church,’ he said. There may be very good will for our churches and our service is deeply appreciated but the message is ignored. You know it and I know it too. ‘Rarely has it been harder for the message to get a welcoming home. But this is not the time for self-pity or regret.’ Lord Carey made his comments in a sermon in Chester Cathedral in a service dedicated to unity between different Christian denominations. They follow his warning last autumn that the CofE’s failure to attract young followers means it is just ‘one generation away from extinction.’ The current Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justice Welby, has been struggling to repair the damage caused by the failure of the CofE’s leaders to secure enough support for women bishops, despite 16 years of preparing the ground. They lost a Synod vote to a blocking minority of conservative evangelicals in November 2012, a defeat that provoked aggressive criticism from politicians at Westminster. A new attempt to allow women to the senior ranks of the clergy is now under way, with opponents apparently ready to give way in order to protect the Church from political interference. Lord Carey, who stepped down from Lambeth Palace in 2002 but remains an active and influential figure, was the Archbishop of Canterbury who secured the first ordinations of women as CofE priests in 1994.","Lord Carey argued need to 'get the house in order' to avoid ruptures .

"By . Martin Robinson . Hundreds today used their Bank Holiday Monday to pay tribute to murdered soldier Lee Rigby by laying yet more flowers, balloons and hand-written notes at the spot where he died in Woolwich. Many sobbed as they came to see the stream of tributes that now runs the whole length of the street where the 25 year old Drummer was executed as he walked to his barracks last Wednesday. Meanwhile 10 miles across London more than 1,000 English Defence League supporters waved placards that read 'Blood on your hands' and 'GB RIP', as well as singing 'There's Only One Lee Rigby', and some anti-Muslim songs as they marched in his memory. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Poignant: Flowers left at the scene where Lee Rigby, who was wearing a Help For Heroes Tshirt, was murdered by two fanatics brandishing firearms, knives and machetes . In remembrance: The number of floral tributes outside Woolwich Barricks has grown over the weekend as people pay their respects . Heartfelt: A young girl adds to the hundreds of bouquets laid at the scene in Woolwich . Respectful: Crowds add to the floral tributes to Lee Rigby. Balloons, bouquets and cards adorn the scene where he was killed last week . They snarled at United . Against Fascism supporters, with both groups largely kept apart by . police as they both protested on Whitehall, close to Downing Street. Witnesses said that both groups then began to throw dozens of glass bottles at each other. Earlier the EDL demonstrators pushed their way through a police cordon as they made their way to Trafalgar Square. They . chanted 'Muslim killers off our streets' and 'There’s only one Lee . Rigby' and protesters held placards that read 'Blood on your hands' and . 'GB RIP'. EDL leader Tommy Robinson told the demonstration: 'This is a day of respect for our Armed Forces.' The crowd repeatedly chanted 'coward' after he claimed Prime Minister David Cameron was on holiday 'because he doesn't care'. Mr Robinson added: 'They've had their Arab Spring. This is time for the English Spring.' Chanting: English Defence League supporters wore Union Jacks and flew England flags as they called David Cameron a 'coward' for going on holiday after the Woolwich terror attack . Making themselves heard: Defence League demonstrators chant anti-Muslim messages during a protest in the sunshine in Whitehall . Faces of fury: Protestors with the English Defence League gathered outside Downing Street. Leaders said the protest was a celebration of the armed Forces . Aggression: Police had prepared for an aggressive protest following the shoicking killing of British soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich last Wednesday . A . group of United Against Fascism supporters staged a . counter-protest at the same time and were penned in by the Met Police to . avoid ugly clashes. Violence broke out when about 100 anti-fascists mobbed five protestors who were arriving to join the march draped in Union Jacks and wearing England football shirts. Police filmed the anti-EDL protesters as they chanted 'fascist scum off our streets' and 'follow your leader, kill yourself like Adolf Hitler' before escorting the EDL supporters around Parliament Square. The demonstrators marched through . Admiralty Arch and onto Parliament Square. They were escorted by . Metropolitan Police officers and vans, while a force helicopter followed . overhead. A Scotland Yard spokesman said Whitehall was closed to traffic because of 'a number of demonstrations'. Tensions have also increased in . certain communities where thugs have been attacking mosques in . retaliation for the murder of Lee Rigby. A Grimsby mosque was last night hit with petrol bombs, while people were inside, including children. Chairman . Diler Gharib said: 'We had just finished our prayers and were . discussing how to thank our neighbours for the support they have shown . us over the past few days when we heard a bang and saw fire coming under . the door. Backlash: A counter-protest, staged by United against Fasciam, led to violence when 100 anti-fascists mobbed protestors who were joining the EDL march . Distressed: Unite Against Fascim demonstrators (left and right) pitted themselves against EDL marchers. Police worked to keep the two groups apart outside Downing Street . Making their point: Unite Against Fascism demonstrators shout across police lines at EDL protesters . 'I grabbed a . fire extinguisher and put it out and then two more petrol bombs hit the . fire escape and the bin so I had to put those out too. 'Luckily . the police have been monitoring the mosque since the last attack and . they were able to arrest two people almost straight away. 'We . have all been feeling on edge and now this has happened. It’s not just . the people at the mosque we are worried about, it’s our wives, daughters . and children who are out in the community. 'People . need to realise that the people who committed the murder in Woolwich . are criminals and it had nothing to do with the Muslim faith.' Two men, aged 33 and 37, have been arrested after yesterday's attack and are still in police custody. Four boys, aged 15 and 16, were arrested after a separate attack on Thursday and were released on bail until the end of June. Chief . Supt Tony Forbes said today: 'I would like to remind people that these . are serious offences which are being investigated and those who are . responsible will be brought to justice. 'It is important to remember that . those people who have committed these offences are a very small minority . and they do not reflect the vast majority of people who live in North . East Lincolnshire. 'The . people who want to engage themselves in this type of criminal activity . will be dealt with using all appropriate police resources and powers. Control: Police officers walk members of the English Defence League protest as they march from Trafalgar Square . Standing guard: Police cordoned protestors off today, in an attempt to keep the protest peaceful . On the run: Police officers move into position as they react to English Defence League members marching . Should David Cameron have gone on holiday as Britain deals with terror crisis? 'I . have spoken to community leaders and what is clear to me is the attacks . will not be allowed to undermine the very good community relations in . North East Lincolnshire. 'My officers will continue to work with all of our communities to protect them and ensure their safety.' On Saturday night riot police were called to stop a ‘Help for Heroes’ walk over fears it would turn violent. Officers carrying shields and batons brought a halt to the parade in Bristol after they received reports of planned trouble. Marchers . said they were raising money for the armed forces charity but internet . rumours claimed  facist group the English Defence League was also . taking part. Police stopped the walk outside a pub - sparking a five hour stand-off which saw up to 40 people barricade themselves inside. Riot police, vans and horses attended on Saturday evening as an operation was launched to contain the group. Scotland Yard said three arrests had been made during the protest and counter-protest outside Downing Street. EDL members congregated after their march in Leicester Square, central London. As one youth was taken away by police, the crowd began throwing bottles at them. One . officer was hit on the head with a glass bottle and the mob followed . the officers, chanting ""who the f*** is Allah?"" before being pushed back . towards the square. Skirmishes . broke out around the square, with several men threatening a youth . wearing a Palestinian scarf with a stick before police intervened. As . the two groups arrived towards Westminster Tube station, the . anti-fascists began to run towards the men, forcing the police to set up . a cordon to protect them. Officers say there were 19 arrests and 12 people were later charged with public order offences and five remanded in custody. Meanwhile an English Defence . League activist who threatened to burn down a mosque in retaliation for . Lee Rigby's murder has been told he faces jail. Adam . Rodgers took to Facebook following the murder and called on his fellow . EDL members to meet him at a mosque in Hastings, Sussex. Attack: This scorched door to the Grimsby Mosque shows the damage caused by the firebomb attack last night . Upsetting: The spray paint has been used to scrub out the inscription on the tribute to the animals which helped keep Britain free . Attack: The Bomber Command Memorial in Green Park, London, was also targeted in the past 24 hours and was then covered in black plastic and guarded by police . A tarpaulin covers part of the Animals in War Memorial on Park Lane, which police say they found at 5am on Monday . The . 28-year-old posted various 'inflammatory' remarks on the social . networking site in the hours following the drummer's death including . 'the mosque needs burning down'. Lead . magistrate Paul Brown, told him: 'The harm you could have created was . potentially huge due to the circumstances. 'You made threats to burn down . a mosque and mobilise people at a time when feelings are running very . high due to a tragic incident. All options will remain open, including . prison.' Two . of Britain's most celebrated war memorials have been defaced, . apparently with the word 'Islam' scrawled across them and inscriptions . scrubbed out with red paint. Police have confirmed they are . investigating the vandalism of the RAF Bomber Command Memorial in Green . Park and the Animals In War Memorial in Park Lane, both in central . London. Pictures taken today show that the damage has now been covered over with plastic or white sheets. Scotland Yard said there have not been . any arrests, so it not clear if it has been done by Muslim protesters or far-right . groups attempting to stir-up hatred. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: . 'At 5am this morning police discovered graffiti on both the RAF Bomber . Command War Memorial in Green Park and the Animals in War Memorial on . Park Lane. Scene: Police and firefighters attend the blaze started by troublemakers at a Grimsby mosque last night . Problems: Hoards of police were forced to break up the walk in Bristol because of disorder . Trouble: Riot officers were called to halt a Bristol walk in support of Help for Heroes after they feared it would stoke up 'community tensions' - this led to 19 arrests . 'Royal Parks' officers and Westminster police are investigating. There have been no arrests at present.' The Bomber Command Memorial remembers . the sacrifice and bravery of the 55,573 RAF crew who lost their lives . in the Second World War and was unveiled by the Queen last summer.

"By . Tim Shipman . Stalinist: Ed Miliband's proposal has been compared to the land grab in Communist Russia . Developers would have their land seized if they fail to build on it, Ed Miliband said yesterday. The Labour leader also unveiled plans to allow towns to expand into rural areas, riding roughshod over local objections. His proposals were immediately condemned as a ‘Stalinist land grab’ and a threat to the countryside. Mr Miliband warned of a housing crisis unless 200,000 homes were built a year – twice the current level, and one million over the life of the next parliament. But in a move that critics warned would undermine property rights, he said town hall chiefs would get draconian new powers to fine developers who hoard land that has been granted planning permission – or even seize it altogether. ‘We’ll say to private developers, you can’t just sit on land and refuse to build,’ he told Labour delegates. ‘We will give them a very clear message – either use the land or lose the land – that is what the next Labour government will do. ‘We’ll say to local authorities that they have a right to grow, and neighbouring authorities can’t just stop them. ‘We’ll identify new towns and garden cities and we’ll have a clear aim that by the end of the parliament Britain will be building 200,000 homes a year, more than at any time in a generation.’ A senior aide said Labour would ‘give councils the power to charge developers escalating fees for sitting on land with planning permission to incentivise them to release the land... and if this doesn’t bite, they would be empowered to use compulsory purchase powers to release the land’. The aide said towns such as Stevenage ‘need to expand’ but have been ‘blocked by neighbouring councils’. Ovation: Delegates were on their feet at the Labour Party Conference, but new policies have been attacked . Graeme Leach, of the Institute of . Directors, condemned the plans, comparing them to Joseph Stalin’s . notorious seizure of land from prosperous Russians known as the Kulaks. ‘Mr Miliband’s “use it or lose it” declaration is a Stalinist attack on property rights,’ he said. ‘The fundamental problem with the housing market is the public sector planning system, not private sector builders. 'It’s hard to imagine a more statist solution to a problem caused by the state.’ Shaun Spiers, of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, backed moves to make developers build on brownfield sites with planning permission to prevent further development on greenfield land. But he condemned the ‘right to grow’ as a threat to the countryside. ‘If they are really saying that regardless of environmental considerations and the wishes of local people, towns can expand in the face of objections from neighbouring authorities, that is going to get them in very hot water. ‘That will end up raising hackles and I don’t think they’re going to be able to deliver it.’ Tory chairman Grant Shapps pointed out that Labour has failed to meet previous pledges to build more homes. He said: ‘The last Labour prime minister famously promised three million homes by 2020 and ten  eco-towns. ‘Instead the Labour government presided over a housing boom and bust which saw the house building industry brought to its knees. ‘Yet again, instead of supporting our policies which will help thousands of hardworking families take their first step on the ladder and backing planning reforms which are bringing through much needed planning permissions, Ed Miliband is offering only more empty promises based on more borrowing and more debt.’ In 2007, Mr Miliband’s predecessor Gordon Brown set a target of building 240,000 new homes a year by 2016. He said he would make house-building a ‘national priority’, as it was in the inter-war years and the 1950s. He set an overall target of three million new homes by 2020. At the time, Tory leader David Cameron accused Mr Brown of recycling old policies, saying that he had made  similar promises on four occasions since 1994. But for every year before 2007, Labour had built fewer social houses than when the Conservatives were in office. Mr Brown had promised to speed up the planning process and to bring surplus public land into housing use. t.shipman@dailymail.co.uk . Sodom and Gomorrah: Mr Blunkett has compared atmosphere to 1930s Berlin . Online porn should be blocked automatically to protect society from ‘bestial activities’, according to David Blunkett. The former Home Secretary supported the opt-in system backed by the Daily Mail. Under this, internet pornography would be blocked unless customers ask their internet service providers to lift the controls. Speaking at an event run by the think-tank Demos, Mr Blunkett said: ‘I think we have a job in this country, in a civilised, free, open democracy,  to protect ourselves from the most bestial activities and from dangers that would undermine a civilised nation.’ Mr Blunkett also likened today’s lax moral climate to the atmosphere in Germany under which the Nazis flourished. ‘In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Berlin came as near as dammit to Sodom and Gomorrah,’ he said. ‘There was a disintegration of what you might call any kind of social order.’ Helen Goodman, Labour’s media spokesman, stressed that the internet should be regulated. She said it ‘should not be like the forest in the 13th century’ where bandits operated ‘outside the law’. ‘That was not a sustainable position then and it’s not a sustainable position now,’ she added.","Labour leader sets out controversial vision for freeing-up land .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . Confession: Forsythia Owen allegedly told police she beat Denzle Rainey to death . A 30-year-old woman has been arrested after she confessed to police she beat a homeless man to death with a baseball bat. Forsythia Owen claimed she attacked Denzle Rainey in an alleyway where he had been sleeping rough because he allegedly molested her four-year-old daughter. As she was interviewed by police Owens, of Englewood, Colorado, allegedly swung her arms repeatedly as she demonstrated how she delivered the fatal blows. Mr Rainey was found in the alley with serious injuries. He had a cracked skull, broken ribs and vital organs had been damaged. A post-mortem examination showed his broken ribs had cut into his liver, Fox 13 reported. The 42-year-old had been living rough while he tried to patch up his relationship with his wife and children. Owens, who was arrested on Monday, is being held in Arapahoe County Detention Center and is facing first-degree murder charges, according to 9 News. She allegedly said to officers that the unnamed child told her Mr Rainey had sexually abused her. Police are investigating Owen's claims that he molested her daughter. When police asked if she was responsible for the man's death, the mother: 'Stood up and said she killed him,' according to an affidavit seen by the Denver Channel. 'Owen swung her hands back and forth and demonstrated how she struck Rainey over and over again because of what he did to [name redacted],' the document stated. The mother allegedly told police that after hearing that Mr Rainey was sleeping in an alley, she sought him out and attacked while he was still sleeping. Scroll down for video . Victim: Denzle Rainey had been sleeping rough in an alley when he was beaten to death . Evidence: Police have marked out the area near a garage where Mr Rainey was found . Troubled: Denzle had recently moved out of the home he shared with his wife and children . She claimed he was still breathing when she left him in the alley. Mr Rainey's injuries were so severe his wife said she struggled to recognize him when she visited in hospital shortly before his death. 'It didn't look like my husband cause his head was so beaten,' Lisa Rainey, who lives in Denver, said. She added that she doubted claims that her husband had molested a child. 'I just don’t know why, what caused her to do this on Denzel, and if Denzel did anything to provoke it,' Mrs Rainey told CBS Denver. 'I need to know the answers for closure for me and closure for my kids.' The couple had been going through a rough patch, and Mr Rainey had recently left the family home as he struggled to deal with drink problems. Cry for help: The father's Facebook posts in the weeks before he was killed show he was struggling with personal issues . Claims: Denzle Rainey, seen here on his 41st birthday, was accused of child abuse by Owens. Police are investigating her allegations but his family deny he had done anything to hurt anybody . Posts on his Facebook page in recent months show the desperate father was trying to seek help at rehabilitation centers. With low self-esteem he had posted several comments, including one just days before he was killed, saying he wanted to take his own life. On September 14 he wrote that he had 'lost everything' then posted: 'I'm going to take pills and drink untell [sic] i don't wake up no moore [sic].' A few days later, on September 17, he appeared in a more positive mood as he asked Facebook friends to help him find somewhere to stay while he waited to return to rehab. And, by September 19, he wrote: 'im still here and doing ok for now'. Homeless: Denzle Rainey had been sleeping rough in this alley, where he was discovered badly beaten . Brutal: Victim Rainey was so badly beaten his wife struggled to recognize him . But, just a couple of days later, he was beaten to death. His recent ups and downs led the mother of his three children to leave a post on his Facebook page explaining that her husband had not taken his own life, but had been killed. According to CBS Denver Owen, who is being held without bond, has been arrested previously on assault charges.","Victim had been living rough as he and wife worked through problems .

"By . Corey Charlton . A mother of seven has been found dead in a jail cell halfway through a 48-hour sentence she was serving for her children's absence from school. Eileen DiNino, 55, was found dead at Berks County Prison in Pennsylvania, during a two day sentence that would have erased about $2000 in fines and court costs. The debt had accumulated since 1999, and involved several of her seven children, most recently her boys at high school. Scroll down for video . Police said Eileen DiNino's death at Berks County Jail is not suspicious but the cause is not yet known . video platformvideo managementvideo solutionsvideo player . US Pennsylvanian state laws criminalise fines for truancy or those for failing to pay a rubbish bill. District Judge Dean R. Patton, who reluctantly sent her to prison after she failed to pay the debt for four years, described her as a 'lost soul'. 'Did something happen? Was she scared to death? This lady didn't need to be there.' Police said the cause of her death was not yet known but it was not suspicious. DiNino's court file showed a laundry list of court fees for one case alone: $8 for a 'judicial computer project'; $60 for Berks County constables; $10 for postage. Judge Patton said he had lost sleep over her death but also acknowledged a short jail stint can sometimes 'break the habit' of parents who'd rather party into the night than take their children to school the next day. He said DiNino did not work or appear to have much help with four children still at home. She frequently skipped hearings, or arrived without requested documents. 'She cared about her kids, but her kids ruled the roost. She was just accepting what was coming, and (would) let the cards fall where they may.' Although she was often unkempt, she came to court clean and neat to surrender the day before her death. She had on clean sweatpants, had combed her hair, and had tape holding her glasses together.","Eileen DiNino, 55, serving sentence to erase $2000 in fines and court costs .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The mother of actor Jason Patric's son, Gus, has made some shocking allegations against the actor as the two currently are engaged in a bitter custody battle over the boy, for whom Patric was only supposed to be a 'sperm donor.' In an exclusive interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Patric's ex-girlfriend Danielle Schreiber claims that Patric is unstable, abusive and made anti-Semitic comments about her and others. The author of the lengthy profile of Patric's judicial rival concedes early in her report that she is a 'friendly acquaintance' of Schreiber. Abused: Danielle Schreiber says Patric abused her both physically and emotionally . Gus: In the midst of a nasty custody battle, Schreiber claims Patric was abusive . Schreiber tells the magazine that Patric was only supposed to be a sperm donor so she could have a child and raise it - even if that meant doing so as a single parent. She also outlines some of the abuse she claims she suffered at the hands of the man who is a leader in the fathers'-rights movement. 'In September 2005, after Schreiber upset Patric, she claims he used . force against her for the first time, grabbing her wrists and pushing . her toward a wall in his Santa Monica home, which resulted in Schreiber . slamming her head,' reporter Vanessa Grigoriadis writes in her piece. 'The next morning, Jason called me and told me he . loved me, for the first time,' Schreiber says. Fathers' rights: Patric has become the face of the fathers rights movement as a result of his legal actions to get custody of his son . In another violent encounter, 'Patric was . sports-betting and drinking, even peeing on a dresser and another time . in a closet at his New York home. She claims Patric threw a jar of . almond butter at her when he found she hadn't put on the lid tight, and . hit her in the face with a land-line phone, causing contusions and . bruises that lasted more than a week.' She claims that Patric also broke his hand when he punched a wall in the middle of one of their fights. The couple broke up in 2008, but reconciled in 2011. According to Schreiber, the abuse continued. '[H]e turned nasty on her again, hurling anti-Semitic epithets like ""Ms. Jew Schreiber"" and ""Jew c***"" at her. (According to an e-mail obtained . by Rolling Stone that appears to be from Patric, he commented, ""F*** . THOSE JEW MOTHERF*****S,"" while discussing a business issue with . Schreiber.),' Grigoriadis writes. Denied: Patric denied all of Schreiber's allegations in the Rolling Stone article outlining the alleged abuse . The couple again broke up after their brief reconciliation, at which point Patric filed a paternity suit demanding shared custody of Gus. Patric responded to the allegations with a statement to the magazine. All these false allegations against me from [Schreiber] and her legal . team are baseless and without merit. They are an attempt to disparage me . after their loss in the Court of Appeal. I will not legitimize the . questions posed by Rolling Stone. There isn't one shred of evidence to . any of this slander…. I will happily present all of my evidence at . trial, and will very soon have Gus back in my arms.

"By . Associated Press . The Federal Aviation Administration indicated Wednesday that it is investigating whether a video of a congressman's wedding last month violated the agency's ban on drone flights for commercial purposes. The agency's carefully worded statement doesn't mention Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y., by name, but said it was looking into ""a report of an unmanned aircraft operation in Cold Spring, New York, on June 21 to determine if there was any violation of federal regulations or airspace restrictions."" Maloney has acknowledged hiring a photographer to produce a video of his wedding using a camera mounted on a small drone. Drones, one of which captured this image of Maloney's wedding, are being used more and more the film social events . Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney is under Federal Aviation Administration investigation after hiring a photographer to produce a video of his wedding using a camera mounted on a small drone . The wedding took place in Cold Spring on June 21. Maloney is a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee's aviation subcommittee, which oversees the FAA. Top agency officials have testified extensively before Congress about their concern that commercial drones could collide with manned aircraft or injure people on the ground. Congress has been pressing the FAA to move faster on creating regulations that will allow commercial drones access to U.S. skies. The agency has been working on regulations for about a decade. 'On their wedding day, Sean and Randy were focused on a ceremony 22 years in the making, not their wedding photographer's camera mounted on his remote control helicopter,' Stephanie Formas, spokeswoman for Maloney, said in a statement. Maloney is a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee's aviation subcommittee, which oversees the FAA . The FAA has approved a few limited commercial drone operations. But the agency has also been sending letters to commercial operators across the country — including other videographers and companies that hire videographers — to cease their drone flights or face fines. One videographer, Raphael Pirker, challenged the $10,000 fine the FAA tried to level against him for flying a small drone in an allegedly reckless manner near the University of Virginia. An administrative law judge sided with Pirker, whose attorney argued the agency can't ban commercial drone flights when it hasn't formally adopted safety rules governing drone flights. The FAA has been sending letters to commercial operators across the country ¿ including other videographers and companies that hire videographers ¿ to cease their drone flights or face fines . The FAA has appealed the case to the five-member National Transportation Safety Board. A decision is expected this fall. Formas, citing the judge's ruling, said there was 'no enforceable FAA rule' or regulation that applied to 'a model aircraft like the helicopter used in the ceremony.' The wedding photographer subcontracted Parker Gyokeres of Propellerheads Aerial Photography in Trenton, New Jersey, to shoot the video. Gyokeress posted outtakes of the wedding on his company's website and created a YouTube video. Maloney's wedding video was first reported by the New York Daily News.","Rep.

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A heroic trainee guide dog saved a woman's life by knocking a chocolate out of her throat while she was choking. Nell, just 17 months old, rescued Lesley Hailwood, 61, on New Year's Eve after a sweet from a Thorntons continental chocolate box got stuck. Ms Hailwood, an IT technician who looks after Nell while she is training, told MailOnline how the insightful animal seemed to know exactly what to do when she got into trouble. Heroic: Guide dog Nell, just 17 months old, rescued Lesley Hailwood, 61, on New Year's Eve after a sweet from a Thorntons continental chocolate box got stuck in her throat . She said: 'It was new Year's Eve, about 11.30pm. Nell was flat out asleep by then because we'd gone out for the afternoon and she'd had a long walk. 'I'd gone into the dining room, and on my way back there was a box of chocolates. I picked one up, put it in my mouth and immediately it got stuck in my windpipe. And it didn't seem to matter what I did, I couldn't get rid of it. I was choking. 'So I then walked from the dining room back into the living room where Nell was - she was still fast asleep. I was standing there, still with my back to her and I was facing the settee. By this time I was starting to panic because I couldn't breathe. 'But she had obviously heard me, and jumped up, ran past me, jumped onto the settee - which is not what she does at all - looked straight at me, got up onto her back legs - she's quite a big dog - and with her two front paws she just lurched at me and hit me in the chest. And it dislodged the chocolate.' Choking: Ms Hailwood, an IT technician who looks after trainee guide dogs, treated herself to the chocolate as she bid 2013 farewell. But when she sat down on her sofa, the chocolate became lodged in her throat, leaving her gasping for breath . Instinctive: Nell, a cross breed between a German Shepherd and a Golden Retriever, jumped on to the sofa and launched her front paws at Ms Hailwood's chest, dislodging the chocolate . Training: Nell is almost at the end of her training, which can take between 17 and 20 months. She is cared for by Ms Hailwood while she is training at a guide dog centre in Liverpool . Nell, a cross-breed between a German Shepherd and Golden Retriever, is almost at the end of her training, which can take between 17 and 20 months. She is cared for by Ms Hailwood - a so-called 'boarder' - while she is not training at a guide dog centre in Liverpool. She lives alone other than Nell. As part of their training guide dogs are often taught to interact physically with the people they help - for example to stop them walking into the road. But knowing how to deal with a person who is choking would not be part of their training, and is instead down to Nell's instincts and intelligence, according to Ms Hailwood. She said: 'The more I tell the story the more I wonder how she knew to do that. It was instantaneous, she didn't panic or anything. It was immediate what she did.' Clever pooch: Ms Hailwood said: 'The more I tell the story the more I wonder how she knew to do that. It was instantaneous, she didn't panic or anything. It was immediate what she did' 'They are very clever, intelligent dogs, and Nell is particularly clever. I've had her since November, while she was doing her training. I've had a couple of dogs before Nell, but I knew straight away she was very quick. 'It doesn't bear thinking about what might have happened if Nell hadn't been there. The chocolate might have dislodged itself, it might not have done. 'I sat there afterwards in shock for a while - but when it dawned on me what she'd actually done I just gave her a big cuddle. She was quite nonchalant. 'I love all the dogs that I have, but Nell particularly is such a clever guide dog. I wish I could keep her. That won't happen - she has to do the job she's trained to do. But because of what she's done she'll always be a bit special for me.'","Lesley Hailwood, 61, was choking at home in Liverpool on New Year's Eve .

"By . Associated Press . A former methamphetamine dealer was executed Wednesday for killing three people in 1995, 19 hours after a federal judge granted a temporary stay. John Middleton, 54, was pronounced dead at 7:06pm after receiving an injection of pentobarbital, becoming the sixth man to be executed in Missouri this year. The execution was originally scheduled for 12:01am, but that got pushed back when a judge granted a temporary stay on grounds that the inmate may be mentally ill, and therefore exempt from the death sentence. That stay was overturned by an appeals court at 5pm however, and the execution proceeded on. Middleton was convicted of killing Randy 'Happy' Hamilton and Stacey Hodge in early June 1995, then Alfred Pinegar several days later. He maintained to the end that someone else was responsible for the slayings. Death sentence: John Middleton, 54, was executed Wednesday for killing three rival drug dealers in 1995. Pictured above in 2007 . 'You are killing an innocent man,' Middleton said in his final statement. State officials, including Governor Jay Nixon, disagreed. 'Tonight has brought a conclusion to a case that illustrates how methamphetamine can have such a monstrous impact on so many lives,' Nixon said in a statement. Michael Black, Pinegar's uncle, questioned why it took so long for the execution to occur. 'Nineteen years seems like a long time to wait for justice,' he said following the execution. Middleton was a small-time meth dealer in sparsely populated northern Missouri in the mid-1990s. After several drug suspects were arrested on June 10, 1995, he allegedly told a friend: 'The snitches around here are going to start going down.' A day later, according to court records, Middleton and his girlfriend met Hamilton and Hodge on a gravel road. Prosecutors said Middleton shot and killed them both and hid the bodies in the trunk of Hamilton's car. Pinegar, another meth dealer according to police, was shot in the face on June 23, 1995. His body was found in a field near Bethany. Acquaintances say Middleton told them he killed all three. Police also had eyewitness accounts of Middleton purchasing ammunition in the hours before Pinegar's death. Middleton was convicted in 1997. Middleton's girlfriend, Maggie Hodges, is serving life in prison after pleading guilty to second-degree murder in all three deaths. In February, a man whose name has not been disclosed because he fears retribution signed an affidavit saying that two rival meth dealers drove him to a rural area soon after Pinegar's death and accused him of being a snitch. He said the men showed him Pinegar's body, saying: 'There's already been three people killed. You want to be number four?' The witness said the two dealers then beat him unconscious with a baseball bat and raped his girlfriend. Neither police nor the courts were swayed by the new witness. Harrison County Sheriff Josh Eckerson agreed to take a new look at the case but said his investigation found no evidence to back up the claims. He is convinced that Middleton was the real killer. Several court appeals claiming innocence were turned away. Missouri has executed one man each month since November, with the exception of May, when the U.S. Supreme Court halted the execution of Russell Bucklew. Bucklew suffers from a rare congenital condition that causes weakened and malformed blood vessels as well as tumors in his nose and throat. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals plans a hearing on Sept. 9 to determine if lethal injection could cause him to suffer because of his medical condition. Another execution is scheduled for August 6, when Michael Shane Worthington is scheduled to be put to death for the rape and killing of a suburban St. Louis neighbor in 1995.","John Middleton, 54, was convicted of killing three rival meth dealers in 1995 .

"By . Associated Press . Microsoft announced today that it will eliminate up to 18,000 jobs over the next year as it works on integrating the Nokia devices business it bought in April. With the Nokia deal, Microsoft's employee headcount rose from about 99,000 last year to 127,000 as of last month. Microsoft Corp said on Thursday that of the up to 18,000 jobs, about 12,500 professional and factory jobs will be cut. Scroll down for video . Microsoft Corp said on Thursday it would cut up to 18,000 jobs, or about 14 per cent of its workforce, as it halves the size of its recent Nokia acquisition and trims down other operations . It anticipates charges of $1.1 billion to . $1.6 billion over the next four quarters, which includes $750 million . to $800 million for severance and related benefit costs. Microsoft's stock rose slightly on Thursday and was currently at $45.44 after jumping 3 per cent. The deepest job cuts in the company's 39-year history come five months into the tenure of CEO Satya Nadella, who outlined plans for a 'leaner' business in a public memo to employees last week. About 12,500 of the layoffs will come from eliminating overlaps with the Nokia unit, which Microsoft acquired in April for $7.2 billion. Microsoft did not say how many jobs would come from Nokia and how many from existing operations. The acquisition of Nokia's handset business in April added 25,000 people to Microsoft, pushing its overall headcount up to 127,000. The Nokia-related cuts were widely expected. Microsoft said when it struck the deal that it would cut $600 million per year in costs within 18 months of closing the acquisition. Microsoft did not detail exactly where the remaining jobs would be cut, but said the first wave of layoffs would affect 1,351 jobs in the Seattle area. Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft (pictured in May). He outlined plans for a 'leaner' business in a public memo to employees last week . The company said it expects to take . pretax charges of $1.1 billion to $1.6 billion over the next four . quarters to account for the costs of the layoffs. Nadella's . cuts are the biggest at the Redmond, Washington-based company since . predecessor Steve Ballmer axed 5,800, or about 6 percent of headcount, . in the depths of the recession in early 2009. The . new CEO's moves are designed to help Microsoft shift from being a . primarily software-focused company to one that sells online services, . apps and devices it hopes will make people and businesses more . productive. Nadella needs to make Microsoft a stronger competitor to . Google Inc and Apple Inc, which have dominated the new era of . mobile-centric computing. Microsoft stock has climbed more or less steadily from the beginning of the year and took a jump after the Nokia acquisition in April . Marking . this change of emphasis, Nadella last week rebranded Microsoft as 'the . productivity and platform company for the mobile-first and cloud-first . world'. Microsoft is not . alone among the pioneers of the personal computer revolution now . slimming down to adapt to the Web-focused world. PC-maker . Hewlett-Packard Co is in the midst of a radical three-to-five-year plan . that will lop up to 50,000 from its staff of 250,000. International . Business Machines Corp is undergoing a 'workforce rebalancing', which . analysts say could mean 13,000, or about 3 percent of its staff, being . laid off or transferred to new owners as units are sold. Chipmaker . Intel Corp and network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc both said in . the past year they were cutting about 5 percent of their staffs. Microsoft announced on Thursday that it will cut up to 18,000 jobs, or about 14 per cent of its staff. CEO Satya Nadella, who took the job in February, delivered the news to staff in a memo that Microsoft released publicly. Here's the text of that memo:From: Satya NadellaTo: All EmployeesDate: July 17, 2014 at 5:00 a.m. PTSubject: Starting to Evolve Our Organization and CultureLast week in my email to you I synthesized our strategic direction as a productivity and platform company. Having a clear focus is the start of the journey, not the end. The more difficult steps are creating the organization and culture to bring our ambitions to life. Today I'll share more on how we're moving forward. On July 22, during our public earnings call, I'll share further specifics on where we are focusing our innovation investments. The first step to building the right organization for our ambitions is to realign our workforce. With this in mind, we will begin to reduce the size of our overall workforce by up to 18,000 jobs in the next year. Of that total, our work toward synergies and strategic alignment on Nokia Devices and Services is expected to account for about 12,500 jobs, comprising both professional and factory workers. We are moving now to start reducing the first 13,000 positions, and the vast majority of employees whose jobs will be eliminated will be notified over the next six months. It's important to note that while we are eliminating roles in some areas, we are adding roles in certain other strategic areas. My promise to you is that we will go through this process in the most thoughtful and transparent way possible. We will offer severance to all employees impacted by these changes, as well as job transition help in many locations, and everyone can expect to be treated with the respect they deserve for their contributions to this company. Later today your Senior Leadership Team member will share more on what to expect in your organization. Our workforce reductions are mainly driven by two outcomes: work simplification as well as Nokia Devices and Services integration synergies and strategic alignment. First, we will simplify the way we work to drive greater accountability, become more agile and move faster. As part of modernizing our engineering processes the expectations we have from each of our disciplines will change. In addition, we plan to have fewer layers of management, both top down and sideways, to accelerate the flow of information and decision making. This includes flattening organizations and increasing the span of control of people managers. In addition, our business processes and support models will be more lean and efficient with greater trust between teams. The overall result of these changes will be more productive, impactful teams across Microsoft. These changes will affect both the Microsoft workforce and our vendor staff. Each organization is starting at different points and moving at different paces. Second, we are working to integrate the Nokia Devices and Services teams into Microsoft. We will realize the synergies to which we committed when we announced the acquisition last September. The first-party phone portfolio will align to Microsoft's strategic direction. To win in the higher price tiers, we will focus on breakthrough innovation that expresses and enlivens Microsoft's digital work and digital life experiences. In addition, we plan to shift select Nokia X product designs to become Lumia products running Windows. This builds on our success in the affordable smartphone space and aligns with our focus on Windows Universal Apps. Making these decisions to change are difficult, but necessary. I want to invite you to my monthly Q&A event tomorrow. I hope you can join, and I hope you will ask any question that's on your mind. Thank you for your support as we start to take steps forward in evolving our organization and culture.Satya .","Microsoft Corp said on Thursday about 12,500 professional and factory jobs will be cut .

A senior law enforcement official told The New York Post the gang had threatened to 'kill a Jersey City cop and not stop until the National Guard is called out.' An internal Port Authority advisory, obtained by The Post, read: 'New Jersey State Police has received credible information from the Jersey City Police Department about specific threats toward Jersey City police officers and law enforcement. 'The United Blood Nation may take retaliatory action against police officers.' It is not known whether Campbell was a member of the gang. A law enforcement source also told the paper a statewide alert had been issued following three shootings involving police in the city. Angelique Campbell, Campbell's widow, said she doesn't plan to restore a memorial to him that went up in their neighborhood but was taken down by Tuesday morning. Santiago will be posthumously promoted to detective, of little comfort to his heartbroken family and friends . More than 1,000 mourners came on Thursday to pay respects . A pedestrian stands at a memorial to Lawrence Campbell, who allegedly shot and killed 23-year-old Jersey City police officer Melvin Santiago . She had told News 12 New Jersey on Sunday that she was sorry for Santiago's family but that her husband should have killed more officers if they were planning to kill him. She later apologized for the comments. 'Both families are hurt. Let this cop be laid to rest peacefully. Let Lawrence be put to rest peacefully. That's it,' Angelique Campbell told The Associated Press on Tuesday. 'There's no back-and-forth. I don't want to argue with no cops, I don't want to fight with no cops. I just want to put him in the ground, he's gone, that's it.' She said that Campbell had slipped back into an old drug habit over the past couple of weeks and 'got back with the wrong crowd.' Santiago was ambushed Sunday as he responded to an armed robbery call at an all-night Walgreen's, authorities said. Other officers returned fire, killing Lawrence Campbell . Authorities in Jersey City, already . on edge following the ambush-killing over the weekend, said an officer . shot a man Tuesday morning who authorities say had attacked him and his . partner with a sharpened fence post. Angelique Campbell, Campbell's widow, said she doesn't plan to restore a memorial to him that went up in their neighborhood but was taken down by Tuesday morning . The . man, whose name was not released, was taken to a hospital and was . expected to undergo surgery for non-life-threatening injuries, the . prosecutor's office said. The police officers were also being treated. West District Commander Capt. Michael J. Kelly said yesterday's shooting was not related to officers being in a heightened state of alert in the wake of Santiago's killing. 'Our officers are always in a high-alert state. That's part of our profession. It's a dangerous profession,' he said. Kelly said condolences have been pouring in from departments across the region. He described Santiago as a quiet, serious young man who had dreamed of being a police officer since childhood and who had just started to hit his stride after less than a year on the job. According to a preliminary investigation of Tuesday's shooting, two officers with the emergency services unit saw the 25-year-old man at about 2:30am and ordered him to drop the fence post, the Hudson County Prosecutor's Office said in a statement. Authorities said the man threw the post through a passenger-side window of the emergency services truck, hitting an officer in the head. The man then reached through the window and grabbed the officer's rifle, authorities said. The two struggled for the rifle, which discharged through the vehicle's door and struck the man, officials said. The officers exited the vehicle and ordered the man to the ground. One officer opened fire, striking the man, after authorities said the man refused to show his hands and hid a hand in his waistband.","Jersey City police officer Melvin Santiago, 23, was killed in the line of duty Sunday by 27-year-old Lawrence Campbell .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . The mommy blogger who is accused of fatally poisoning her 5-year-old son with salt is on suicide watch in a New York jail while she awaits trial. At a hearing on Wednesday, Lacey Spears' lawyer asked the public to 'keep and open mind' about the charges. Spears 'looks forward to her day in court and the opportunity to challenge the allegations,' attorney Stephen Riebling said after a brief court session. 'We continue to trust the people will keep an open mind and not judge Lacey or the facts of this case based on what's been reported,' he said. 'The defense of this case will be focused on the relevant facts, not fiction.' Scroll down for video . Lacey Spears (pictured here in May) is 'devastated' by her son's death and is currently on suicide watch, her lawyer revealed . He would not elaborate. Spears, 26, was not in court on Wednesday. Riebling would not comment on how she is doing behind bars except to say that she is 'devastated' by her son's death. A sister, Rebecca Spears, was in court but would not comment afterward. Lacey Spears, of Scottsville, Kentucky, pleaded not guilty last month on charges of depraved murder and manslaughter in the death of Garnett-Paul Spears. The boy died in January at the Westchester Medical Center when, prosecutors say, his sodium levels rose to an extremely dangerous level with no medical explanation. Spears, then living in Chestnut Ridge, New York, was sharing her son's hospital room - he had been brought there after suffering seizures - and doctors thought she might be harming him. Prosecutors believe she administered sodium through a feeding tube in his stomach. Garnett-Paul Spears died in a New York hospital from unexplained sodium poisoning. Prosecutors say his mother slipped it into his feeding tube . Spears, who is originally from Decatur, Alabama, for years had chronicled on social media what she said were the boy's various medical crises. The depraved murder charge alleges extreme recklessness rather than intentional killing. It carries the same maximum sentence, 25 years to life in prison. Spears' lawyers have not yet filed the paperwork that would be required if they plan to offer a psychiatric defense. They would not comment Wednesday on whether that was being contemplated. Acting state Supreme Court Judge Robert Neary gave the defense until September to file motions. He set October 13 for the next court date.","Lacey Spears is accused of depraved murder in the death of 5-year-old Garrett-Paul Spears .

"By . Australian Associated Press . It's taken nearly a year but the Abbott government has finally delivered on its promise to axe the carbon tax. After days of debate and stalling tactics, the Senate on Thursday voted 39 to 32 to unwind the carbon pricing scheme introduced by Labor in 2012. But it wasn't the clean finish the government had wanted. Scroll down for video . The prime minister has delivered on his key election promise to abolish the carbon tax following a fight he has pursued like a zealot since seizing the Liberal leadership from Malcolm Turnbull in December 2009 . It had to adopt as it own, amendments proposed and changed three times by the Palmer United Party after the Senate last week voted down the repeal bills a second time. This time, as promised by Clive Palmer, his three senators and PUP ally Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party's Ricky Muir gave the government four of the six votes it required to pass the repeal package. Family First's Bob Day and Liberal Democrat David Leyonhjelm - also on the crossbench - rounded out the majority needed. Independent senator Nick Xenophon and DLP senator John Madigan also backed the repeal. Labor and the Australian Greens opposed the legislation as expected but fell far short of the numbers needed to defeat it as they did in March. PUP moved the only successful amendment to ensure savings to energy companies from the repeal were passed on to consumers and businesses. As promised by Clive Palmer, his three senators and PUP ally Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party's Ricky Muir gave the government four of the six votes it required to pass the repeal package . That was a key demand by Mr Palmer in return for committing his crucial Senate team to backing the repeal. Another proviso for his support was that a future emissions trading scheme be established in case Australia's trading partners act the same way, but that will be dealt with in other legislation. Things didn't always go smoothly for the government as it pushed for an early repeal. It was forced to re-introduce its repeal bills to the lower house on Monday following days of intense negotiations with PUP in the wake of the embarrassing defeat in the Senate. Australian Greens Christine Milne (left) has slammed the senate's decision to scarp the carbon tax . When the bills returned to the Senate, Labor and the Greens dragged out the debate until a vote was taken at 11.14am on Thursday. Greens leader Christine Milne made a last-minute plea to the crossbench telling them it was a 'critical moment' for the nation. A vote to repeal was a vote for failure to address global warming, she warned. 'Australia will be relegated to a pariah and a backwater.' Labor's Lisa Singh said Australia risked becoming the ""laughing stock of the world"".","The PM has delivered on his key election promise to abolish the carbon tax .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A newlywed from Maryland has revealed how watching her boyfriend momentarily die in her arms confirmed how much she loved him, and inspired her to change career. Erica Koogle had been studying English at university when an undiagnosed heart defect nearly took the life of her then-boyfriend Cody in January last year. The shock of nearly losing the man she loved spurred Erica on to not only get married, but also to change her career plans and become a nurse. Devoted: Erica and Cody have their first dance a year after a heart defect nearly killed Cody . On the day of the heart attack Erica, then 19, had been getting up early to work on a paper for university. 'Normally when I get up early Cody . tries to keep me in bed, and would wrap his arms around me as I tried to get up. But his arms were stiff and . then he started flailing them,' she told Mail Online. 'I thought it was a joke at first. It was very unexpected. It took me about 10 seconds to realize what was happening and to dial 911.' Unbeknown to the couple, who had been dating for a couple of years, Cody had Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome which means that an extra electrical current runs through his heart. Before the heart attack Cody had been a program director at a martial arts studio, and the couple were both fit and healthy. 'We just woke up and he was dying,' Erica said. 'We both do martial arts, and were in good health so it really came out of the blue.' Worrying times: Cody, pictured as he recovers from having a defibrillator fitted. He was unconscious for a couple of days after the heart attack . After calling 911, Erica pulled Cody to the floor and started to perform CPR until paramedics arrived and shocked his heart back to life. 'He was very . heavy. I don't know how I managed to get him off the bed without . whacking his head,' she said. 'When I got home from the hospital later that day I . was so sore and didn't know why. Then I remembered, I'd lifted a 200lb man.' After being unconscious for three days, and undergoing several procedures including having a defibrillator fitted, Cody is slowly getting back to his former self. The heart attack was a life-changing . moment for the couple, who decided to get engaged about eight months . later. They celebrated their wedding earlier this year. On Friday, Erica posted a picture of the couple having their first dance at their wedding on the Blaze Best Moments Facebook page. 'In January 2013, my boyfriend died in my arms,' she wrote under the picture. The picture is of our first dance at our wedding just over a year later. Commitment: Cody and Erica had been dating for about two years when he had a heart attack. The experience made their relationship stronger . Life changing: After nearly losing Cody, Erica decided to retrain to become a nurse . 'That day was the best day I could ever hope to imagine. He is mine, he is healthy and he is not stuck in a bed anymore!' The experience changed Erica's life professionally as well as personally. Before Cody's heart attack, she had been studying English and sociology, but the medical emergency made her rethink her career plans. 'We'd been . dating about two years. I already knew I wanted to marry . him but seeing him like that and realizing he may not be there any more . made me realize I couldn't be without him,' she said. After suffering panic attacks, Erica decided to take a semester off to help her come to terms with what had happened. During this time she decided to retrain as a nurse, and is due to start her training in Towson University this August. For Cody, who had been working as a project director for a martial arts studio, he remembers very little about the heart attack or the days that . followed. Remarkably, he returned to sports . training just two weeks after leaving hospital. Although martial art . remains his passion, he changed career, and gone into the restaurant . business. Unexpected: The heart attack came as a shock to the couple, who both do martial arts and thought they were fit and healthy . Erica . said that on the day he regained consciousness she was at home and had . missed a call at 5.30am from the hospital, which had panicked her. 'I . was really stressed, thinking ""Did he die again?"". Then his mother came . to the top of the stairs and called out, ""Cody's on the phone, he's . bored"". 'He wanted to know what's going on and when I was going to visit,' Erica laughed. The couple, now aged 21 and 23, said they still talk about the shocking experience, saying it has become part of their lives. Erica even mentioned it in their vows. Fortunately, since his diagnosis, Cody has suffered no further problems.","Erica Koogle had to perform CPR on her then boyfriend Cody after his heart stopped beating .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . A judge in Detroit has lashed out at a 19-year-old gang member - telling him he needed a father to 'beat the hell out of him' and keep him out of trouble. Wayne County Judge James Callahan made the stunning remark before sentencing Latrez Cummings to six months in jail for his role in the brutal mob-style assault on a motorist in April. In response to the judge's question, Cummings said his father wasn't around when he was growing up. Scroll down for video . Wayne County Judge James Callahan (left) told Detroit gang member Latrez Cummings, 19, (right) that he should have had a father to 'beat the hell out of him' Callahan said Cummings needed a dad, . 'someone to discipline you. Someone to beat the hell out of you when you . made a mistake, as opposed to allowing you or encouraging you to do it . to somebody else.' Cummings and four others have pleaded guilty to assaulting Steve Utash, who was in a coma for days after the April attack. The mob pounced on him in Detroit after he got out of his pickup truck to help a 10-year-old who had stepped in front of his vehicle. The judge's comments preceded a loud, spirited exchange with assistant prosecutor Lisa Lindsay, who said the six-month sentence was too light. She accused the judge of offering Cummings leniency because he didn't have a father growing up. She pointed out that there are many young black men who were raised without a father but haven't committed crimes. Cummings is black. 'Did I ever use the term ""black?""' replied Callahan, who is white. 'It doesn't matter if a person is black, white, yellow or red.' Cummings was the last defendant to be sentenced in the case. The longest sentence was nearly 6 ½ years in prison for a man whose punishment was enhanced because of his criminal record. Steve Utash was left with permanent brain damage and was in a coma for days after he was beaten by Cummings and his friends in April .","Prosecutors accused Judge James Callahan of using Latrez Cummings lack of a father as a reason for leniency .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A heartbroken Chinese mother claims her only son refuses to see her any more because he thinks she is 'too ugly'. Ding Liang, 63, was found crying in the street in the city of Hangzhou in eastern China after travelling for five hours to try to meet her newborn grandchild. She had lugged a carrying pole with bags of clothes and presents for the baby in the hope that her son might have a change of heart when she arrived. But after he refused to answer his phone and because she did not know exactly where he lived, she was forced to leave in tears, taking the gifts back home with her. Heartbroken: Ding Liang, 63, breaks down in tears as she tells a Chinese TV station how her son refuses to see her because he thinks she is 'too ugly' Ding was spotted standing outside a housing complex by 53-year-old local man Hsin Pai, who was so shocked by her story that he called the local TV station, which turned up to interview her. She told them that she was from a village outside Yuyao, a city in the same Chinese province as Hangzhou and that she had been very proud of her son and only child when he had done well at school and got a place at university. After graduating, he had moved to Hangzhou after landing a good job at an upmarket car dealership and had married. But he had reportedly been embarrassed by his mother's presence at his wedding because she had dressed like a peasant and after that he'd had very little to do with her. In tears: Ding travelled for five hours to see her son and his newborn child, but he refused to answer his phone and she did not exactly where he lived . She said: 'I don't mind, I know he has his own life now, so I understand that he doesn't call and only speaks to me when I ring him. 'But when he rang me the other day to say that he had had a baby, I wanted to visit him and bring my grandchild some gifts. 'He told me not to come. He said I would embarrass him because I'm too ugly.' She said she had decided to go anyway and had woken up at 4am to catch the bus to see her son, who she didn't name but who she said was 32 years old. When she arrived, he had not answered the phone and she had been left out on the street unsure exactly which flat he was in. Sad: The 63-year-old had lugged a carrying pole with bags of clothes and presents for the baby, but she was forced to take them back home with her . He said: 'My husband told me not to come. I said our daughter-in-law has given birth, so I definitely must come, that I'll bring some stuff to give them. 'I got up at 4am and got here a little after 9am. But I have been waiting here all day long and my son is still not answering his phone.' At the end of the day, she left still carrying the handmade baby clothes and gifts. In a short TV programme about the woman's visit that ended up widely discussed in Chinese social media, the presenters acknowledged that there might be an additional reason why the son was refusing to see his mother who had clearly come bearing gifts for her grandchild. But at the end of the day, they added: 'Whatever the additional matters might be if there are any, when it comes to a mother who gave birth to a child and raised that child, what is there that cannot ultimately be tolerated or forgiven?'","Ding Liang, 63, found crying in street after her son refuses let her visit .

'His Kidney function has returned and he is free of the need of Dialysis. His heart function is within normal range. His lung function is perfect. His tummy is coming around. He has not had the need of a blood transfusion in a month.' After the boy's remarkable recovery, his supporters changed their hashtag to #SavedJosh. Early this morning, Josh and his parents arrived at their home in Virginia after a 14 and a half hour journey from St. Jude Children's Hopsital in Memphis, Tennessee. Josh will be able to stay home and recover from his horrific illness until late this month, when he will return to St. Jude's for a checkup.

A small, lonely structure is dwarfed by the storm cloud as it rolls overhead in the New Mexico desert . The pictures were taken one afternoon in June, as a fierce supercell loomed over the state of New Mexico. Supercells are particular types of thunderstorms that have a rotating updraft. This is also known as a mesocyclone. Of the four classifications of thunderstorms (supercell, squall line, multi-cell, and single-cell), supercells are the overall least common and have the potential to be the most severe. They can occur anywhere in the world under the right conditions, but they are most common in the Great Plains of the U.S. as well as the plains of Argentina, Uruguay and southern Brazil. The storms they spawn can cause hail, flash floods, barrages of cloud to ground lightning and even tornadoes - and pose extreme perils for people and aircraft. Mr Miller has been chasing such storms for two years. Forks of lightning crackle inside an enormous supercell looming over homes in Roswell, in these photos taken on June 7 .

If you are in the company of a trained meteorologist, as I was, you are in good hands and I never felt any danger. 'Although it looks as though we are right underneath the storms they are still miles away and we watch them pass by from ""photogenic"" vantage points.' The 63-year-old added: 'Having said that, one should never try it alone and always rely on a good meteorologist to guide him or her near storms of this nature, as they are indeed violent and do wreak damage on the areas that they pass directly over. 'Most of these storms pass over uninhabited areas but when they do hit towns and cities the results can be tragic - and often are.'","Supercell storms like these can cause tornadoes, hail storms, flash floods and barrages of lightning .

"By . James Slack . Crime figures are likely to increase sharply following revelations about police ‘fiddling’ the data, MPs were warned yesterday. The UK’s statistics watchdog revealed there has been no proper audit of the figures recorded by the police for an astonishing five years. The experts predict that, when the figures are thoroughly checked, it will lead to crime once again beginning to rise. It would be a blow to ministers who have repeatedly trumpeted that recorded crime has fallen by 10 per cent since the Coalition came to power. Latest revelations: The UK Statistics Authority has revealed there has not been a proper audit of police crime figures for five years after withdrawing its stamp of approval on police crime figures . In the year to June last year, recorded crime was down by 5 per cent. The figures are 38 per cent lower than 2002-03. The UK Statistics Authority (UKSA) also said they wanted to check there are no problems with other government data. Figures on the likes of ambulance response times and NHS waiting times are also likely to come under renewed scrutiny. Last . week the Mail told how, in an extraordinary move, the UKSA had stripped . the police’s recorded crime figures of their ‘gold standards’ status. The watchdog said there was increasing evidence that the data was ‘unreliable’. A string of serving and ex-senior police officers have admitted to concerns that forces have been ‘fiddling’ the figures. Warning: MPs have been told that crime statistics are likely to rise after a proper audit has been conducted of police figures . Yesterday, . UKSA head Sir Andrew Dilnot expressed regret the watchdog had not . highlighted major problems with the information earlier. He . told Westminster’s Public Administration Committee: ‘It is quite . conceivable, indeed I think quite likely, that if there is proper . auditing introduced, the recording of crime is improved, that we will . see recorded crime increase.’ Sir . Andrew said there had been inadequate auditing since 2007-8, and . statisticians had been voicing concerns for years. John Flatley, head of . crime statistics at the Office for National Statistics, said some . police appeared to be ‘confused’ about whether offences should be . recorded if there was not enough evidence to bring a charge. Crime prevention minister Norman Baker has admitted there is a 'dent' in public confidence in police data . In . his own evidence to MPs, crime prevention minister  Norman Baker . accepted that there was a ‘dent’ in public confidence in the police . data. But he insisted: ‘I don’t accept that the Home Office has any . interest in manipulating figures. We have no interest in having figures . that do not tell us the truth.’ He . added: ‘I still hold to the view that there is not an endemic problem . in the sense that there is a deliberate attempt across forces to massage . figures’. But Labour MP . Paul Flynn insisted ministers should be more ‘repentant’ about the . ‘mathematical gymnastics’ that had been taking place, claiming there had . been ‘a remarkable capacity for self-delusion’. The next set of quarterly crime statistics is due tomorrow. Committee . chairman Bernard Jenkin accused the Home Office of ‘complacency’. And . he warned London mayor Boris Johnson and 13 crime commissioners who have . set their forces local targets to reduce their recorded crime figures . to make sure this does not lead them to chase targets rather than to cut . crime. In previous . evidence to MPs, police told how politically sensitive crimes had been . reclassified. For example, a burglary might be called criminal damage to . downplay its significance. Some . offences are recorded as ‘no crime’. A victim may not be able to prove . their mobile phone was stolen so it is logged as ‘lost’. The Office for National Statistics (graph showing crime levels since 1981, pictured) has already said police records 'appear to overstate the rate at which crime has been falling'","UK Statistics Authority has withdrawn its approval of police crime figures .

"By . Freya Noble . A group of lucky surfers had a very close encounter with a large whale on Sydney's northern beaches on Sunday. However they were warned to steer clear of the southern right whale as they were spotted just metres from the huge marine mammal at Freshwater beach. Footage from the Nine News helicopter showed the group surrounding the creature as it slowly swam and splashed near the surface. Scroll down for video . Stay back: Surfers were warned over the loudspeakers at Freshwater Beach on Sydney's norther beaches to keep their distance from the southern right whale on Sunday . One surfer can be seen trying to make a quick escape when the whale made a sharp turn towards it, while others hung back and watched the whale from a distance. The southern right looked to be in a playful mood, rolling around in the water and flicking its tail. According to government guidelines swimmers should not be closer than 30 metres to a whale, while surfers and boats are required to keep a distance of at least 100 metres. The southern right whales are often spotted along the NSW coastline at this time of year . Freshwater resident Ian Hansen told Fairfax he first noticed the whale because it was surrounded by surfers. 'To be honest they were harassing it a bit. They were so close and it had no room to move... If I was the fish I'd be harassed too. It'd move a bit and they'd back off,' he said. The surfers were reportedly told to increase their distance from the whale over the loudspeakers at Freshwater Surf Lifesaving Club. Surfers are supposed to stay 100m away from whales, as are boats, while swimmers are meant to keep a distance of 30m . The club president Wayne Frankly also spoke to the publication, and told them he was worried people were so close as a surfer was hospitalised last year after a run in with the same breed of whale at Bondi. 'The whale was within the confines of our beach, just having a sticky beak and some riders went out to have a look,' Mr Freakly said. Southern right whales usually measure between 14 and 18 metres long and can weigh up to 80 tonnes. They are often found in shallow water, are known to have encounters with surfers and are spotted on the NSW coastline at this time of year during migration. Southern right whales can measure up to 16 metres and weigh up to 80 tonnes .","Footage shows a group of surfers surrounding the southern right whale .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A tiny wooden beach hut with no water, electricity or even a toilet has sold for a staggering £180,000 within days of going on the market. But while it may not have many mod cons or amenities, and cost as much as a three bedroom house in Liverpool, the 12ft x 18ft hut boasts priceless views over the The Solent towards the Isle of Wight. The one-bedroom cabin, which sleeps four people at a squeeze, opens directly onto the beach at Mudeford near Christchurch, Dorset - one of the most sought after pieces of real estate in the world. Former owner Sarah Litchfield soaks up the glorious sun outside her wooden beach hut which has sold for a staggering £180,000 . Room with a view: The £180,000 price tag buys stunning views across Mudeford near Christchurch, Dorset . But with no mains sewerage, there is no toilet and the buyer will have to walk a nearby amenity block to spend a penny. The hut went on the market a few weeks ago and sold within days for a rumoured £180,000, it emerged today. Will Wright, of Waterside Properties, said: 'There was definitely a lot of interest - that’s for sure. 'It was talk of the town when it went up for sale. 'The beach huts down there are so popular, I am not surprised it sold so quickly.' Sparse: The 12ft x 18ft hut opens directly onto the beach at Mudeford near Christchurch, Dorset, but does not have a toilet . Some mod cons: The wooden hut at Mudeford near Christchurch, Dorset, sleeps four people and has a top-of-the-range fitted kitchen with a gas cooker and fridge . Home sweet home: The hut may not have a toilet or running water but does have a relatively well appointed kitchen with cooker . Hard sell: Former owner Sarah Litchfield, who owned the property for the last 10 years, said it was a tough decision to sell . The one-bedroom hut is not accessible by car and owners will have to walk to the short distance to enjoy their new purchase. There are solar panels on the roof which power the spot lights and one 12v socket, similar to those seen in cars. Water is obtained from a communal standpipe and the sink drains via a soak-away under the property, with toilets in a nearby amenity block.

The new owner - who does not want to be named - now owns the leasehold on the property until 2029 and will have to pay a yearly service charge of £1,986.00 to Christchurch Borough Council. It qualifies for a reduced council tax bill of £499.56 but can only be lived in for a maximum of ten months of the year. Former owner Sarah Litchfield, 48, who owned the property for the last 10 years, said she agonised over the decision to sell. She said: 'I had a mad moment 10-years-ago and bought it, I’m a local girl and everyone dreams of having one. 'I have spent many happy years down there and it has been a tough decision to sell.' You’d be forgiven for thinking a one bedroom cabin at £180,000 is a unique lot on the housing market. But, in parts of the UK, these tiny ‘properties’ come with massive price tags. Boasting ‘near by’ taps and shared showers, it’s amazing how much we will pay for some sand beneath our feet and a view of the sea. We take a look at five of the UK's most expensive beach huts... 1. A kitsch baby blue beach hut measuring just 23ft by 6ft in Shaldon, South Devon comes with breathtaking views of the village harbour and a whopping £245,000 price tag. This luxury cabin comes with under floor heating, a marble wet room and electric windows which automatically close when it rains. The quaint huts can be hired out to tourists for £90 a night. The developer, Bernard Howard, said: ‘The position is exceptional - at high tide you can practically dip your toes into the sea. ‘The hut hides a deceptively spacious interior, like Dr Who's Tardis, he said. The baby blue beach hut in Shaldon, South Devon, is priced at £245,000 . 2. A one-room former harbour master's hut (pictured below) was put on the market for the eye-watering asking price of £250,000. The hut at Rozel Bay Quay, Jersey, boasts views across the harbour of the fishing port and as far as France. This traditional former harbour master's hut had an asking price of £250,000 . 3. A bottle green beach hut in East Anglia went on the market for a whopping £70,000. Holidaymakers visiting Wells-next-the-Sea has steps down onto the beach, where scenes from the Hollywood blockbuster Shakespeare in Love, were filmed. The hut also boasts royal links, as footage of a young Prince Charles and his sister Anne playing on Holkham beach emerged last year. Despite its lofty connections,  the hut boasts a 'close-by' water tap and a lavatory block for the beach. The distinctive bottle green cabin in Wells-next-the-Sea will set buyers back £70,000 . 4. A one-room hut on Mudeford Spit, Dorset is on one of the most sought-after stretches of real estate in the country. The cabin has no running water, no mains electricity, and very little in the way of creature comforts, but it more that makes up for that with a breath-taking location. It's sunny yellow exterior and beautiful location makes up for this hut's lack of amenities . 5. A 17ft by 15ft timber hut with a felt roof went on the market for a staggering £280,000 back in 2007. The building sits on the seafront at West Bexington, Dorset, in the heart of Britain's Jurassic Coast.

"By . Ray Massey, Transport Editor . Low-emission electric cars will be introduced across Whitehall - but David Cameron will be keeping his Jaguar and Range Rover until his 'heightened security needs' are considered . Prime Minister David Cameron could swap his ministerial limousine for an electric car under plans to make Whitehall's vehicle fleet greener. Charging points for electric cars will be installed in Downing Street and a Cabinet minister said he expected all members of the Government ‘will want to be at the forefront of this’. Under the plans, the use of vehicles by Government departments will be reviewed and where appropriate ultra-low emission alternatives will be procured. But the Prime Minister's heavily modified and armoured Jaguar XJ limousine and Range Rover support vehicles would not be immediately replaced, as security concerns would need to be addressed in assessing any potential alternative. However, engineers at Jaguar Land Rover in Coventry and Warwickshire are already developing hybrid petrol-electric power – including work at a new advanced propulsion centre at University of Warwick - for their future vehicles so the wait may not be too long. Under the first phase of the scheme, around 150 electric cars and vans will replace existing vehicles across Whitehall. The programme will then be expanded to allow the wider public sector including councils, police forces and the NHS, to introduce around 135 more plug-in vehicles. In both phases, charge points will also be installed to provide infrastructure support for the new cars and vans. Transport minister Baroness Kramer said: ‘Government must lead by example. Today's investment will see government switching a significant number of plug-in cars and vans into our fleets and leading the electric charge.’ Cabinet Office minister Oliver Letwin said the infrastructure for electric cars was being installed in the heart of Government: ‘We are extremely anxious to use the Government's purchasing power to increase the chances that the British public as a whole will take up electric vehicles. ‘May I say as part of that, after some investigation, we have actually managed to establish a team to put proper charging points up and down Downing Street so that we can also run electric vehicles in Downing Street itself.’ Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander, pictured here looking at plug-in cars with Deputy Prime Minster Nick Clegg, said the move would lead to 'much lower running costs and close to zero emissions' Asked if Mr Cameron would be using an electric car, Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander said: ‘Part of the programme here is about working with different parts of Government to work out where electric vehicles can best meet the needs of individual departments and individual ministers. ‘Clearly where there are heightened security needs - there are particular issues in relation to that which would need to be addressed, but I think that every member of the Government will want to be at the forefront of this. 'It's one of the many industries where we see the UK absolutely at the cutting edge.' Mr Alexander said he hoped to be 'one of the first in line' to use an electric car, adding: 'This is the right thing to do, with much lower running costs and close to zero emissions, these vehicles will save the taxpayer money and be much greener.' The £5million ultra low emission vehicle (ULEV) readiness project is the first step in plans to make electric cars and other plug-in vehicles commonplace in government fleets. The Government Car Service, which provides cars for ministers, has already begun its review and plans to order the first electric cars in the autumn.","£5m project will see cars replaced across Whitehall to create greener fleet .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Newly elected councillors are being given tips on how to keep themselves safe – from voters. Members of Camden Council in north west London have been handed a four-page dossier outlining the precautions they should take when meeting the public. According to the four-page leaflet, representatives must 'sit nearest to the door' and lay out seating at '45 degree angles [to avoid] appearing confrontational'. Councillors at Labour-controlled Camden council in north London have been issued with a safety leaflet on meeting with voters, including planning an escape route and having car keys in your hand . On another, more sinister note, it adds: 'Make sure there are no heavy items in the room that could be used as weapons' and 'get a space which has a swift means of escape'. Liberal councillor Andrew Pennington, 39, was killed in Cheltenham by a man with a samurai sword . For the especially anxious, there is even this instruction: 'Have your (car) keys in your hand [and] park facing the way you want to drive off'. It warns that 'abusive phone calls', 'malicious anonymous letters' and 'unwanted callers at private homes' are all risks councillors face. Camden Council has taken the drastic move 14 years after a constituent brandishing a Samurai sword stormed into his local MP's constituency office in Cheltenham, Glos, and launched a brutal attack. Liberal councillor Andrew Pennington, 39, was killed as he went to the defence of MP Nigel Jones, who was seriously injured by the attacker. Cllr Theo Blackwell, who has taken surgeries in Camden for 12 years, said: 'I became a councillor not long after the sword attack and it was quite a live issue at the time. 'I've not had a problem in any of the surgeries I've attended but we do need to make sure the new councillors know the proper safety precautions.' The Labour councillor admitted: 'Something that does make some councillors a bit uncomfortable is having to make public their home addresses. 'I still don't know why we can't just put the address of our surgeries.'","Safety leaflet given to councillors in Labour-controlled Camden, London .

"By . Ray Massey, Transport Editor . Nine out of ten shops make potentially fatal mistakes when showing parents how to use child safety car seats, a report claims. It found 90 per cent of stores visited – including branches of Halfords, Mothercare and Mamas & Papas – did not install car seats correctly. Even the best performer, John Lewis, failed two-thirds of fittings, an undercover investigation by consumer champion Which? found. A new report has revealed that nine out of ten shops failed to correctly fit a child safety car seat (file picture) Its report said inadequate training led to ‘serious failings and potentially dangerous mistakes that could put lives at risk’, with staff who ‘spoke confidently but gave bad advice’. Experts visited 42 stores – six branches of each major retailer, and six independent stores. They asked staff to fit two seats, an easy Isofix model that clicks into place, and a seat that attaches to a seatbelt. Only four shops installed both seats properly. Babies R Us and Mamas & Papas outlets failed 11 of the total of 12 fittings. Kiddicare failed nine out of 12 and staff ‘made serious errors’. Halfords managed two successful fittings, Mothercare three and John Lewis four. Independent stores did slightly better, with seven of the 12 seats installed correctly. Mistakes included leaving a safety support leg folded under a seat. One seat was not attached securely. The investigation found a safety support leg folded under a seat and a seat which was not attached securely (file picture) The report said staff did not take enough time and some even claimed products were broken. It adds: ‘It was clear . . . failings were often down to a lack of training. Buying a car seat isn’t enough on its own – it needs to be properly fitted, too.’ Which? editor Richard Headland said the results were ‘unacceptable’. The report noted: ‘Of the stores we visited, 90 per cent failed to fit our car seats correctly. Only four managed to fit both our car seats properly and 13 failed to ask any essential questions before the fittings.’ ‘Our experts identified three chains that performed the worst and made dangerous errors which could put a child in serious danger if the car was involved in an accident. Babies ‘R’ Us and Mamas & Papas each failed 11 of the 12 fittings with a catalogue of mistakes, while Kiddicare failed nine’. The report added: ‘Although Halfords passed fewer fittings than Kiddicare, Kiddicare made it into our worst three because staff made serious errors which could put a child in danger if the car was involved in an accident with the car seat as it was fitted.​’ Mamas & Papas said it had worked ‘incredibly hard’ on training and was disappointed. Babies R Us said it will strengthen training, while Kiddicare is investigating and will take action where needed. John Lewis said it will ensure the findings are used in mandatory car seat training. Halfords said it has accredited fitting courses and has ‘substantially improved’ service.","Nine out of ten shops made fatal mistakes when fitting a car child seat .

"By . James Tozer . A former child sex victim who became a paedophile hunter by posing online as a young girl watched yesterday as an office worker who fell for her sting was jailed for almost two years. Samantha Roberts, 20, who was lured to a house and raped by an Asian gang when she was 12, set up fake profiles to ensnare middle-aged men using a teenage chatroom to prey on young girls. By using digital technology to alter the sound of their voices, she and her boyfriend – dubbed a  ‘paedophile hunter’ by police – convinced the men that they were talking to schoolgirls before handing the evidence to detectives. Yesterday Lee Barton, 47, a team leader at a rail infrastructure firm, was jailed for 21 months by a judge who branded him ‘a parent’s worst nightmare’. He had messaged one of the duo’s alter egos saying he wanted to ‘do stuff’ to her, while a second man caught by Miss Roberts asked one of the ‘girls’ to perform a sex act. Daniel Bates, pictured left, received a . suspended sentence, while Lee Barton, pictured right, was jailed for 21 . months. The two both admitted to attempting to incite a child to engage . in sexual activity . Judge Timothy Mort said the case highlighted how the internet made youngsters vulnerable to grooming, saying: ‘It is obviously a worry for parents whose children are using these teenage chatrooms as to who is getting in touch with them.’ But following the rise of vigilante groups such as Letzgo Hunting, detectives last night warned people worried about child abuse not to take the law into their own hands. Miss Roberts had been walking home in Oldham in 2007 when Shakil Chowdhury lured her into his car before taking her to a house where she was plied with alcohol and repeatedly raped by the 39-year-old and three other men. Chowdhury was jailed for six years, and Miss Roberts later waived her right to anonymity to campaign for tougher sentences for paedophiles. Last year she and boyfriend Steven Walker, 24, began examining US-based chatroom teen-chat.org, which is aimed at 13 to 19-year-olds, over fears that paedophiles were using it to groom potential victims. They set up fake profiles including ‘Chloe12’ and ‘Aleshia13’, and in April last year Walker contacted Aleshia asking for a private conversation. He claimed to be 18 and made sexually explicit suggestions to the girl. Despite the pair’s ‘coy’ and ‘non-committal’ responses, he asked to meet up so they could ‘do stuff’, including ‘maybe a f*** if you want to’, Philip Curran, prosecuting, told Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester. The pair were sentenced at Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, today . Speaking via their computer’s microphone but using a synthesiser so Mr Walker’s voice sounded like a girl’s, they gave Barton a phone number and he called to ask ‘whether she was on her own’ and what time her parents would be home. At that point, Miss Roberts told Barton that the conversation was being recorded and the pair’s  evidence was handed to police. Smartly dressed in a grey suit and holding his head in his hands, Barton, from Doncaster, was jailed for 21 months after pleading guilty to attempting to arrange or facilitate the commission of a child sex offence and attempting to engage a child in sexual activity. He was also handed a five-year sexual offences prevention order. A second man, 36-year-old Daniel Bates, of Warrington, Cheshire, contacted ‘Chloe12’ in April last year and asked her to perform a sex act on herself. Wheelchair-bound Bates – who  suffers from cerebral palsy and learning difficulties – was given a 15-month sentence suspended for 18 months after admitting attempting to engage a child in sexual activity. He was also made the subject of a prevention order. Earlier this year Philip Moule, 66, of Basildon, Essex, was given a three-year community order for offences arising out of their pair’s sting. After yesterday’s hearing, Miss Roberts said: ‘I’m happy about the first sentence but appalled at the second one, I think it is ridiculous.’ Detective Sergeant John Coleman, of Greater Manchester Police, said: ‘We strongly encourage people not to take the law into their own hands and to contact the police at the earliest possible time.’","Two paedophiles caught by former abuse victim posing as teenager online .

"By . Richard Spillett . Joe Willis, who stalked his former neighbour for five years before trying to kill her in a horrific knife attack, was given a life sentence today . A stalker who made his former neighbour's life a living hell before  trying to kill her in a horrific attack has been given a life sentence. Joe Willis carried out a five-year hate campaign against Helen Pearson, who kept a diary of the 125 stalking incidents she suffered. In one incident, the words 'DIE HELEN DIE' were painted on the street outside her home. Her ordeal culminated in a brutal attack, when Willis dragged her into a graveyard and stabbed her eight times with a pair of scissors. Willis, of Exeter, Devon, was convicted of attempted murder at Exeter Crown Court earlier this year and given a life sentence today and ordered to serve at least 13 years behind bars. Judge Paul Darlow said Willis, 49, put Miss Pearson through a five-year 'campaign of harassment motivated by pure malice and a desire to make her life a misery'. Miss Pearson said the stalking began after Willis asked her to go and watch a pub band with him but she declined. She said he later made silent phone calls to her before moving on to vandalism of her home and car, leaving graffiti in the street and attacking her parents' home. A dead cat was left on her doorstep and she had to install bars on her windows and change her mobile phone every few months. She was sent threatening letters, which claimed her stalker knew her movements and included personal items stolen from her rubbish bin. Miss Pearson, 34, has hit out the inability of police to do anything about her treatment. Following his conviction, she said: 'I was convinced the stalker was going to kill me but I felt powerless to do anything about it. 'I felt let down by the authorities that should have been there to help me, that no one cared and that I was a nuisance. I was shocked. 'When I look in the mirror I feel completely baffled as to why Joe Willis did all this to me. I did nothing wrong.' She added: 'The only way I thought I could end the stalking was to take my own life and in August 2009 I attempted to do that. It wasn't a cry for help, it was a real attempt to end the suffering.' Her parents - who have lodged an official complaint against the police - were forced to hire a private detective to hunt down her tormentor. Helen Pearson kept a diary of the 125 stalking incident before she was stabbed by Willis in a cemetery . She says she attempted suicide at one point because she thought it was the only way her ordeal would end . Miss Pearson's nightmare only ended following the stabbing in the  Exeter cemetery known as The Catacombs. Speaking of the attack, she said: 'The first I knew about it was when I was stabbed in the back. I turned and saw it was Joe. 'I saw his eyes and he looked absolutely furious. The first blow pushed me to the floor and he kicked me and was trying to drag me along into the Catacombs. 'That was where it was going to end. I tried to get free. I felt another kick and stab from behind. 'I thought this is going to go on until I am dead. He was deranged and so evil. I had six stab wounds on my back. 'I remember seeing the scissors and turning my head and seeing them come down. I saw his eyes were full of murder. He definitely wanted me to die.' The attack ended when a female motorist confronted Willis and he was later arrested. Willis' lawyer today said he maintains his denial of being her stalker and taking the weapon - the scissors - to the scene of the murder bid. Speaking outside court after the sentencing hearing, Miss Person said: 'I am relieved. It has taken some time coming, It's a relief that he is off the streets and cannot harm other people.' The stalking started with silent phone calls but progressed to vandalism in the street and threatening letters . As well as paint being splashed on her car and front door, Mrs Pearson found a dead cat on her  doorstep .","Helen Pearson suffered five years of abuse at the hands of Joe Willis .

"By . Tamara Cohen, Political Correspondent . Ed Miliband faces a crucial test on the world stage next week as he is due to meet Barack Obama at the White House. Meetings between an opposition leader and the US president are a high-stakes affair, and have been described as a ‘job interview for being prime minister’. It is expected Mr Obama will grant Mr Miliband a short meeting on Monday, known as a ‘brush by’, during which the president will drop in on a meeting between the Labour leader and high-level US officials. Ed Miliband laughs at Barack Obama's quip the last time the pair met in 2011, when the U.S. president visited London. The leader of the Opposition is set to meet Obama again next week at the White House . This is typical for an opposition leader and is the same level of courtesy offered to David Cameron when he met George Bush in 2008. Mr Miliband is said to have been keen for some time to make a White House trip, in an effort to convince sceptical voters he can be prime ministerial. But it's not known whether the leader of . the Opposition will swing by New York afterwards to visit his brother . David, who was last night hobnobbing with the stars. The former Labour foreign secretary, a staunch Blairite who was beaten to party's top spot after his younger sibling secured the support of the unions, was at a summer party hosted by the International Rescue Committee, the aid organisation he has run since 2010. The lavish event in New York City's The James Hotel drew stars including Broadway actress Laura Osnes, celebrity chef Eden Grinshpan, and Homeland actress Morena Baccarin. David Miliband at the GenR Fourth Annual Summer Party at The James Hotel last night in New York City. Left with Chef KPE and Eden Grinshpan, and right cuddling up with broadway actress Laura Osnes . Mr Miliband has been the president and chief executive of the International Rescue Committee since quitting UK politics in 2010 after he was beaten in the Labour party leadership race by his brother Ed . But while David is riding high on the New York social scene, Ed's visit to Washington, which has not yet been officially confirmed, could be a media minefield. Neil Kinnock’s meeting with Ronald Reagan just before the 1987 general election turned to disaster when the president then publicly expressed concerns about the then Labour leader’s views on nuclear disarmament. Mr Miliband’s decision to scupper military action in Syria last summer may well have burned some bridges in the US. Ed Miliband has hired David Axelrod, right, as an election advisor. Mr Axelrod used to work for the president . PJ Crowley, a former aide to Mr Obama, said last week the debacle, in which David Cameron’s plan for air strikes was dramatically defeated, had left ‘bruises’ in Washington. The Labour leader is also expected make a speech to a Washington think . tank detailing how Labour and the Democrats think similarly about how to . share the proceeds of economic growth. He is said to be hoping that the links . between the Democrats and the Labour party, as well as the fact that his . strategist David Axelrod used to work for the president, will smooth . the way. Mr Miliband has not made many diplomatic visits. His first high profile foreign trip as opposition leader earlier this year, to Israel and the Palestinian territories, was seen as successful. Neil Kinnock's meeting with Ronald Reagan in 1986 was a disaster for the Labour leader after the US President attacked the party's policy on nuclear disarmament . Mr . Miliband and Mr Obama have met before, when the president visited . London in 2011 and could meet again at a Nato summit in Wales in . September. The ongoing crisis in Syria, and the pull-out of troops from Afghanistan, which Mr Miliband would have to oversee if he wins the next election, are likely to be high on the agenda. The last Labour opposition leader to have a successful first trip to the White House, which paved the way for becoming prime minister, was Tony Blair in 1996. Mr Blair’s former chief of staff Jonathan Powell recently warned that such visits have to run like clockwork, as it is ‘the nearest the leader of the opposition gets to a job interview for prime minister’. Gordon Brown was said to have been ‘snubbed’ when he met Mr Obama at the United Nations in New York in 2009. It was claimed the president refused five requests for a private meeting with him. They only met finally in a bizarre ‘kitchen summit’ at the UN building.","Ed Miliband set to meet with Barack Obama at the White House next week .

'I went to another shop to see if they had it but they told me it wasn't even on sale until the 23rd and they started making phone calls. When I went back to JD it had been taken off the shelves and the staff all looked a bit panicked. 'I'm gutted I didn't buy it now as I would have been the first fan to own it.

"By . Paul Collins . Generous Louis van Gaal negotiated a £1.2million donation to charity as part of his first contract as Manchester United manager.

Instead, Van Gaal requested that the club donate the money to his favourite charity - a £600,000 fee he matched himself, as revealed by The Sun. Van Gaal's chosen charity, for whom is an ambassador, is Dutch-based Muscles for Muscles, who raises awareness for spinal muscular atrophy. A Sun source said: 'This is typical of Louis. He is a great man and a generous man. 'He has spent years working with charity and helped raise so much money for those less fortunate.' Manchester United declined to comment on the story because it is a private matter. Van Gaal, who gives his first press conference at United on Thursday, has signed a two-year deal at Old Trafford.

"By . Max Riddington . My mum chased moths away from my bedroom when I screamed as a kid, gathering them up in her hand and throwing them out of the window, promising they turned into fairy dust. She sat up all night to finish knitting me a school jumper for the new term despite having a full-time job. When my baby son was rushed to hospital with suspected meningitis 26 years ago, Mum dashed there and gave me the hug I craved as my tears flowed. As her only daughter, we shared a special bond. And I always knew she loved me. So when Mum no longer recognised me and called me Margaret, after her 2003 dementia diagnosis, it was the loneliest day of my life. Happier days: Max Riddington (centre), with her mum Shelia, dad ken and son Tom, then aged three . Nothing could have prepared me for that moment. My dad had just died from cancer, now my mum had Alzheimer’s and believed I was someone else. I felt completely lost. For the next eight years, I watched as the disease stripped her of every last semblance of humanity. Because of that, I know if I had to choose, I would rather have cancer. That's why I was so astonished when Sarah Vine wrote in the Mail last week that she would be happy to take a new blood test that can predict if you will get Alzheimer's. Why would you do that when you know there is no cure? What benefit is there in foreseeing yourself, imprisoned in a mind that, slowly but surely, is closing down? ""Yes, cancer is ugly. But it doesn't have . to end in death. Caught early, there is hope of cure or remission. With . Alzheimer's there are no survivors, only victims. You can't fight it. It's going to get you"" By the time Alzheimer's had finished with Mum, she could not move, speak or see. Her world had become a single bed in a small room. Why would I want to know if this might become my future, too? Dad may have died of cancer but he was still my dad right until the very end, telling me with his last gasp to 'shut up' as I urged him to 'stay with me' and 'hang in there' - showing the flash of fighting spirit that made me so proud to be his daughter. Yes, cancer is ugly. But it doesn't have to end in death. Caught early, there is hope of cure or remission. With Alzheimer's there are no survivors, only victims. You can't fight it. It's going to get you. When my dad Ken died of lung cancer in February 2003 - just 16 days after being diagnosed - it was only five months after my mum Sheila had been told she had dementia. She'd grown forgetful, had trouble counting out money to pay for groceries, despite having worked in a bakery all her life and being lightning quick at giving change. Mum had begun to switch off the freezer when she came over to help me around the house. I left a note reminding her not to, but every time I arrived home the plug was pulled out. In the end I taped the socket. What benefit is there in foreseeing yourself, imprisoned in a mind that, slowly but surely, is closing down? asks Max . Initially, I put this down to her age - she was then in her mid-seventies. One Christmas Day as we played Cluedo she couldn't remember any of the characters or pieces, but I fobbed it off. I just could not believe my darling mother - a bright, organised woman - could have dementia. Mum and Dad met at Leicester's Palais de Dance in 1943 when she was 16 and he was 18, readying himself for war. They married in 1947 - 'The same year as the Queen', Mum always reminded us - after his four years in the Navy. They built a life together. My two older brothers were born in 1949 and 1951, and I followed in 1961. When they left their council house in Leicester after 40 years and moved a few miles away to the village of Foxton Locks to be nearer to me in 1993, it was meant to be where they would spend a long and happy retirement. Sadly, their dream was cut short. On a day trip to Norfolk, Mum, Dad, my teenage son Tom and I went for a cream tea. As I poured the tea, Mum asked for a knife and fork. 'It's a cream tea, Sheila,' Dad said. 'You don't need a fork.' But Mum was having none of it. Shortly afterwards, in summer 2002, we took Mum to the doctor. He asked her questions, such as her address, the name of the Prime Minister, and, as I was there, what date I was born. But she couldn't remember, laughing to cover her embarrassment, offering Christmas Day instead. I took her hand and said 'it's OK,' while Dad stared at the floor, stunned. That moment changed everything. In September, she was referred to a memory clinic, where a consultant confirmed, after many tests, our worst nightmare - Mum had Alzheimer's. It took a while for this to sink in. We tried not to think about what lay ahead, instead planning lots of trips out to distract us all. Then, in early February 2003, Dad was struck down. It seemed one minute he was putting up a shelf, the next he had collapsed and I was searching for his favourite cap to keep his head warm as we set off for hospital in the freezing depths of winter. Loved parents: Max's dad Ken died from cancer, while her mum Shelia had Alzheimer's disease for the last years of her life . The next few days were a roller-coaster of tests, diagnosis - then disbelief that he had lung cancer. My dad, an ex-council worker, didn't want to die, but after war service in Hiroshima, always had a sense of living on borrowed time. His reaction was that while cancer would kill him, he'd do it his way. He came home from hospital on a cold, frosty Valentine's Day, slipping his hand in mine as we walked down the garden path together one last time. The neighbours rallied around, bringing his favourite food - bangers and mash and home-made custard tart. He got to say his goodbyes. He told me I had been 'a wonderful daughter' quite casually as we sat together doing the crossword. It meant the world to me. He treasured each night lying next to the woman he loved and had married almost 60 years before; he reminded his grandson Tom that: 'It's how you treat people, not what you earn, that really matters in the end.' ""Mum's Alzheimer's dominated our lives for years, taunting us daily with the reality of who she was becoming"" Dad died at home on February 17, the eve of his 77th birthday, in his beloved bungalow surrounded by those he cared about most. Yes, he'd been in pain but it was over very quickly and for that, I was grateful: Mum's Alzheimer's dominated our lives for years, taunting us daily with the reality of who she was becoming. With Dad gone, I became Mum's carer. She had difficulty remembering he'd died and would ask, 'Where's Ken?' over and over again. In the beginning I would tell her he was gone, and each time it was as if she was hearing it for the first time, searing pain etched her face as she sobbed or screamed. I resorted to saying he was in the greenhouse and would be back soon. It comforted her. When I moved house in 2004, Mum became anxious at every visit and once ran straight into the road. I reluctantly locked the door when she came over. I bought her a pendant engraved with her name and my phone number, in case she wandered off. I felt great guilt - it was like tagging a dog. Within a year, Mum lost track of whether it was day or night and had to have Social Services carers. They called one day to say Mum had taken the azalea plant to bed, another time, she stuffed a bouquet of flowers down the toilet. Test for Alzheimer's: The red colours are a warning of Alzheimer's Disease, while the green indicate a normal healthy brain . After a few years she grew paranoid, terrified 'a tall man' was trying to break into the bungalow. As her speech deteriorated, she would mumble or repeat a single syllable over and over again. People would turn away as if she didn't exist. Yet she needed others more than ever. I can't imagine how afraid she must have felt. Her face changed, a blankness overtook her eyes, as if she had been switched off from the inside. After three or four years, when she could no longer talk, I found new ways to communicate, playing Glenn Miller to conjure up the days with Dad and, when we could no longer go on trips, bought a box that played the sound of the sea. Thankfully, her last few weeks were peaceful. Classical music played, I slept by her bed in the bungalow and waited for her to pass away. I told her I loved her, and that she would be with Dad soon, dancing one more time. She died in November 2010, aged 83, eight years after she was diagnosed. But, unlike Dad, we never got to say goodbye. Alzheimer's doesn’t allow you that. See alzheimers.org.uk .","Max lost her beloved mother, Sheila, to the disease that has no cure .

"By . James Chapman . Adamant: The London Mayor lambasted the idea that a move to cut immigrants' child benefits could be hampered by EU law, claiming it is necessary . Boris Johnson is urging David Cameron to withdraw child benefit from migrants working in the UK despite an escalating row with Poland over Britain’s crackdown on benefit tourism. The Mayor of London said the UK had become a magnet for those from countries with ‘much, much less generous welfare systems’. He insisted there was ‘no reason at all’ why the UK could not stop paying child benefit to migrant workers, a move Downing Street insists would require an EU treaty change. Speaking on LBC radio, Mr Johnson said Britain was open to ‘talented, hard-working people’ but accused Labour of losing a grip on immigration when it was in power. He backed Mr Cameron’s plans to rein in the benefit payments paid to immigrants but said the Government could go further. ‘The payment of benefits is one of those areas under EU law that is devolved to government,’ he said. ‘We can decide who qualifies for child benefit. You’ve just seen it – the Government has just changed the rules [to limit child benefit for the better-off]. ‘Why should British taxpayers be paying the child benefit of people who may be working in Britain but whose children are living in Poland?’ Mr Johnson also said that a new qualifying period before EU migrants are able to claim any out-of-work benefits should be extended from three months to two years. According to Treasury figures, the UK pays child benefit to the parents of 40,000 children living in another EU member state. A No10 spokesman insisted that restricting the benefit would require changes to EU treaties and that extending the qualifying period for incomers’ benefits to more than three months would be struck down in the European courts. Mr Cameron said at the weekend that he wanted changes to EU rules that would allow Britain to limit benefit payments and pointed to Poles, among the biggest migrant communities in Britain, as an example of the potential for the rules to  be abused. Row: Cameron became embroiled in a row with Poland's foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski after suggesting we should cut immigrants' child benefits. Mr Sikorski accused the prime minister of stigmatising Poles . Attack: Mr Sikorski hit back at Tory suggestions to cut child benefits for immigrants from countries like Poland . It provoked an angry response in Poland, with prime minister Donald Tusk saying his country was ready to veto any legal changes allowing the UK to selectively cut welfare benefits. The two leaders are due to have a phone call on the issue today. Ukip leader Nigel Farage raised the temperature in the immigration debate yesterday by saying that it should be cut even if it slowed economic growth. ‘I would rather we had communities that felt more united and a situation where young unemployed British people had a realistic chance of getting a job,’ he said.","Mayor said UK open to 'talented, hard-working people' but gave warning .

Appeal: If Anderson is found guilty he could be banned for up to four matches, before any appeal .

Anderson and Jadeja have been charged after their fracas in the stairwell of the Trent Bridge pavilion as they made their way off for lunch on day two of the drawn first Test.

Head of officiating in England Mike Riley, who attended Brazil 2014, has been asked for a report on the spray’s suitability to the top-flight. It was seen as a positive addition to matches at the World Cup, used by referees to draw lines for defensive walls to stop encroachment as well as around the dead ball to prevent attackers moving it nearer goal. For the time being nothing has been ruled out or in by those in charge at the Premier League, who still need to establish what domestic referees think, whether there is a desperate need, and how much time it may add to the game.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The New Mexico Corrections Secretary has taken the undercover boss concept to the extreme, spending 48 hours in solitary confinement in a Santa Fe prison. Prisoner 106, according to prison records, is a dangerous armed robber - but in actual fact, he's Gregg Marcantel, the head of corrections for the state of New Mexico. Dressed in a prison jumpsuit, Marcantel was indistinguishable from the other prisoners housed in the 12-foot-by-seven-foot concrete cells of Level Six at the New Mexico State Penitentiary. Inmate number 106: Gregg Marcantel in his prison jumpsuit, set to enter solitary confinement for 48 hours . Usual appearance: Mercantel is New Mexico's Corrections Secretary who is intent on overhauling the prison system, particularly what he believes is an overuse of solitary confinement . Marcantel wants to overhaul the state's prison system, and do away with what Marcantel believes is an over-reliance on solitary confinement. Segregating prisoners in solitary cells costs up to three times as much as it does to house the general prison population and can make prisoners even more dangerous, according to some critics. Marcantel told ABC News that in order to bring about change, he needed to experience the prison system from the inside. 'You really need to feel it. You need to taste it, you need to smell it, you need to see it, firsthand,' he said. Following the 1980 riot at the Penitentiary of New Mexico, one of the country's most violent prison riots in history, the policy became to place any prisoner who was acting up in solitary confinement, in an attempt to avoid a repeat of the horrific events. During the 1980 riot, 33 inmates were killed and more than 200 sustained injuries. Seven corrections officers were treated for injuries caused by beatings and rapes. Level Six: Between them, the 282 prisoners in solitary at New Mexico State Penitentiary have killed 138 people, reports ABC . Experience: Marcantel in his 12-foot by seven-foot solitary confinement cell . Relief: Marcantel had to spend 48 hours in the cell, but some prisoner spend years without having any human contact except for prison guards . But . Marcantel doesn't think that solitary confinement is necessary for any . but the most dangerous criminals - and that for some, it could make them . worse. 'We are sending them back to our neighborhoods worse than when they came... I can’t allow that,' he said. Back on the job: Marcantel says that while he wouldn't want to repeat it, his 48 hours in solitary was a valuable experience . 'Segregation should be a last resort,' Marcantel told ABC News. 'We have to be very careful about how we use it.' Some . of the other 282 men housed in solitary confinement along with . Mercantel had been there for years, allowed one hour outside in a . concrete cage per day, and no human contact except the guards holding . their arms. 'Not . sure I want to do it again, but I am really glad I did it,” he said of . the experience afterwards, which saw him suffering from boredom, . claustrophobia and nausea. Marcantel pretended to be deaf so that when other inmates questioned him about who he is, he didn't have to respond. Following his time behind bars, Marcantel has already begun reforming the system. However, he doesn't plan to do away with the punishment altogether. 'There is such a thing as evil,' he told ABC. 'It’s not whether or not they are going to hurt people — they started hurting people when they were four years old - and it’s up to me to make sure that not only am I protecting other inmates from them, but I am also protecting my staff from them.' Marcantel said the most dangerous criminals must be kept segregated, but that other prisoners should be punished in different ways, such as the removal of privileges. Eight of the prisoners housed in the Sante Fe Pen's solitary confinement unit have been brought out of Level Six solitary in preparation to rejoin the general prison following Marcantel's stay in solitary.","New Mexico Corrections Secretary Gregg Marcantel spent 48 hours in solitary confinement at New Mexico State Penitentiary .

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . Lewis Hamilton is wary of the effect the euphoria currently being experienced by Nico Rosberg could have on his Formula One world title rival's bid for a home race triumph in Germany this weekend. Rosberg departed the British Grand Prix on his first serious low of the campaign as he suffered his maiden retirement this season after finishing the opening eight races either as winner or runner-up. Up for it: Lewis Hamilton feels World Cup factor will boost his hopes at German Grand Prix . With Hamilton claiming victory on his own . home soil at Silverstone, the gap between the duo was also slashed to . just four points in the German's favour. But following that blow for Rosberg, in the space of a few days he then got married, watched Germany win the World Cup and signed a new long-term contract with Mercedes. In terms of attempting to wrest back the initiative from Hamilton, Rosberg could not have asked for more, and will now be buoyed by the backing of thousands of ecstatic Germans at Hockenheim. 'For every driver when he goes into his home race he gets a boost, and I think Nico will have that extra boost this weekend,' said Hamilton. On the charge: Hamilton is just four points behind German Nico Rosberg in F1 standings . 'Not least because Germany have just won the World Cup and the whole country is on a serious high. 'Hopefully that will also have a positive effect on the whole team, as Mercedes-Benz.' Rosberg, who concedes he has had a 'very positive week', is naturally hoping to tap into the positive vibe that has swept his country in light of the World Cup triumph. Relishing the challenge: Lewis Hamilton arrives at the circuit in Hockenheim on Thursday . 'The effort of the team as a whole, how they all played together was really great to see and that's what helped them win the tournament,' said Rosberg. 'That's what we at Mercedes are trying to do as well, to really work well, everybody together, to make the most of it. 'We're also on the right track in that respect because to dominate the sport as we are doing indicates we work pretty well together as a team. 'Of course there's room for improvement, but we're going in the right direction.' The only low note for Rosberg over the past few days has been FIFA putting a block on his planned helmet design for this weekend. Sign of the times: Mercedes hospitality unit has been customised to celebrate Germany's World Cup triumph . Following Germany's fourth World Cup triumph via their 1-0 victory over Argentina at the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro, a thrilled Rosberg immediately sought to reflect his team's achievement. On Tuesday Rosberg tweeted a picture of the helmet he had planned to wear at Hockenheim, resplendent with the colours of the German flag. Primarily, it was adorned with four stars to indicate the number of times they have been crowned champions, whilst on top was an image of the World Cup. FIFA, however, caught wind of the situation and contacted Rosberg's manager Georg Nolte to inform him his driver would have to remove the image due to an infringement of its intellectual property rights. Defending its decision to ban the design, a FIFA spokesperson said: 'FIFA is obliged to take action against any unauthorised reproduction of its intellectual property in a commercial context. 'If FIFA would not follow up on any potential infringements of its intellectual property, it would risk losing its legal right and title to such works, thereby endangering the foundation of its commercial programme which is driven primarily by the access to and usage of our brand marks, including the FIFA World Cup trophy. No way: FIFA have blocked Nico Rosberg wearing special World Cup helmet . 'An example of the strength of FIFA's intellectual property assets is reflected by recent research in seven key global markets where the FIFA World Cup trophy recorded an average recognition level of 83 per cent. 'These levels are significantly higher than any other sporting trophies. 'As a result, we cannot allow a commercially branded helmet to feature the FIFA World Cup trophy as this would jeopardise the rights of our commercial affiliates. 'We appreciate Nico Rosberg's desire to congratulate the German team and have therefore been in discussions with the Rosberg team to attempt to find a solution, whereby he is still able to show his support for Germany without using FIFA intellectual property in a commercial context.' Rosberg conceded to being caught by surprise by FIFA's regulations, saying: 'The World Cup as a trademark - these are the kind of things you have to think of. It's amazing. 'I was surprised but of course I fully understand. It was a pity because the helmet looked really cool with the trophy on top. 'I've replaced it now with a big star and no-one can take that away. The star is ours!'","Lewis Hamilton hopes World Cup triumph will boost his Mercedes team .

"By . Mark Wilson . Josh Law could have been forgiven for wondering what all the fuss had been about. A mere nine minutes into his competitive debut, he netted Motherwell’s first European goal in four years. Another swiftly followed to  confirm a positive first impression of the summer signing from  Alfreton Town, who hopes to  replicate the impact elder sibling Nicky made in this parish before exiting for Rangers. His big brother could have told him, however, that things are rarely that simple when it comes to continental competition. Delight: Motherwell's Josh Law celebrates his first goal after opening the scoring against Stjarnan . And so it proved. Stuart McCall’s side somehow blew the advantage Law delivered on a night of immense frustration at Fir Park. The turnaround was extraordinary. Seemingly poised to extend their lead after that early double, the Premiership runners-up lost  direction from the moment Olafur Finsen pulled one back via a  first-half penalty. The same player then scored again from the spot in injury-time after Motherwell had survived a few second-period scares. Ultimately, the Icelandic part-timers were worthy of their draw. From a position of strength, McCall’s men now have significant work to do in Reykjavik next Thursday night if they are to remain in the Europa League. The draw for the third qualifying round takes place today, but no one at Fir Park will be looking beyond redemption in the second leg of this tie. Motherwell had previously gone through seven European matches — against Odense, Panathinaikos, Levante and Kuban Krasnodar — without getting on the scoresheet. Double: Law scores his second goal against Stjarnan . A meeting with Stjarnan  represented a significant drop in class from those opponents but a much-desired victory remained agonisingly elusive. The undulating first half opened on a note of concern. McCall had spent much of his pre-match deliberations stressing the need to learn from previous European experiences and guard against being picked off on the break. After a mere four minutes, it seemed those words had fallen on deaf ears. His side forced a corner which resulted in a Lionel  Ainsworth cross being cleared. One crisp pass was all it took for Arnar Bjorgvinsson to be released into swathes of space on the right. His initial cross was overhit but Daniel Laxdal gathered on the opposite flank and plonked a  perfect delivery on to the head of Veigar Gunnarsson. His woeful miss from six yards proved the equivalent of an alarm call for the Lanarkshire line-up. Suddenly wide awake in their passing and movement, Motherwell claimed the lead after nine  minutes. It was a landmark goal — after 639 blank minutes in Europe — of simple execution. John Sutton bullied Niclas  Vemmelund to get on the end of Keith Lasley’s looping centre from the right. When the downward header was parried by goalkeeper Ingvar Jonsson, Law had the easiest of tasks to knock into the net. It was 2-0 10 minutes later after the hapless Vemmelund slipped near the touchline. Iain Vigurs pinched possession and moved infield, eventually playing a delightful pass to Law inside the area. The assist was given the  finish it deserved as the midfielder dinked first-time over the despairing Jonsson. Hit the spot: Stjarnan's Olafur Karl Finsen slots a penalty past Dan Twardzik . Motherwell were looking in ebullient form, with Stuart Carswell passing up a more than presentable chance for a third after Sutton’s smart lay-off. Yet the serene mood inside Fir Park — bathed in sunshine — was fractured 10 minutes before the break. Danish referee Michael Johansen pointed to the spot when a firm, deflected strike from Gunnarsson struck Lasley’s hand. A booking added insult to his injury. Finsen dithered slightly in his run-up but produced the perfect penalty, tucked just inside the post as Dan Twardzik threw  himself in the opposite direction. Worse could — and probably should — have followed for a  previously dominant Motherwell before they were back in the changing room. A last-ditch challenge from Craig Reid thwarted Finsen, with Twardzik then forced to thrust out a leg out and expertly deny Bjorgvinsson’s drive. Nerves were becoming distinctly frayed. McCall attempted to apply a soothing balm at half-time but  the flow of the game remained unpredictable. Stephen McManus saw a firm, low shot well held by Jonsson before Stjarnan produced their second glaring miss of the evening. Bjorgvinsson swept in a terrific cross from the right that found Finsen ideally positioned. Yet he somehow sent a close-range volley wide of the near post to answer Twardzik’s prayers. Law had begun to hobble a touch and his impressive debut was brought to an end after 69 minutes when he departed alongside winger Ainsworth. Travelling: Stjarnan fans celebrate as their side get one back against Motherwell . Youngsters Fraser Kerr and Lee Erwin were introduced to the action as Motherwell sought to recapture a spark. Again, though, it was Finsen who threatened. This time, he was just plain unlucky with a ripping, angled effort that bounced a fraction wide of Twardzik’s right-hand post. He would, though, have his  second goal as Stjarnan snatched a dramatic leveller in the first minute of added time. Again, Lasley was penalised, this time for a foul on substitute Rolf Toft. Once more, Finsen was  perfectly cool from 12 yards to send a ripple of booing around Fir Park at full-time.","Law scored a double on his competitive debut for Motherwell .

"By . David Kent . Louis Tomlinson's joint takeover of Doncaster Rovers along with John Ryan has been left in serious doubt due to funding issues. The duo had announced a deal to take control at the club last month following the exchange of contracts and a press conference held in London last month, and they had hoped to secure the finances required through a crowd funding initiative. But the pair have announced they have failed in their scheme, after releasing a joint statement. Rain on the parade: Louis Tomlinson's joint takeover of Doncaster is in serious doubt . Fan: Tomlinson is a lifelong supporter of Rovers and even appeared for their reserves last season . The . Trust set up a funding scheme with the aim of raising £2million but the . deadline for pledges passed on Thursday with the total more than . £1million short of the target, which means Ryan will now not pass the . Football League's 'fit and proper person's test'. 'The Tomlinson Ryan Trust Crowdfunder . project has failed to reach the target as set out under the terms of . the funding arrangements,' they said. 'The result of this will be that all pledges will be cancelled and funds returned to the relevant parties. 'As . a result of the funding not being available from Crowdfunder for the . DRFC project, John Ryan is unable to meet the requirements of the . Football League Fit and Proper test. 'The consequence of this is that the deal to takeover the club is now in serious doubt.' The Trust had previously stated the takeover of the club would go ahead irrespective of the success or failure of its crowdfunding project. It is . understood Ryan, who last November stepped down as Doncaster chairman . thus ending a 15-year association with Rovers, met with Football League . representatives this week in a bid to reassure them he and Tomlinson had . the finances to run the Sky Bet League One club. However, The Football League issued the following statement in response to comments Ryan regarding the proposed takeover of Rovers. A spokesman said: 'In any club takeover it is a requirement for the prospective purchaser to provide a business plan and to demonstrate that the funding is in place to deliver on that plan. 'This is part of the League's ongoing efforts to ensure the financial sustainability of our clubs. 'In this case, this fundamental requirement has not yet been met. We are in close contact with the Club and will continue our dialogue.' Pop: Tomlinson's (second left) image rights caused the takeover to be stalled on two occasions . Return: John Ryan was also part of the joint takeover bid . The . takeover had been set for completion on Friday and will come as a huge . blow to the One Direction singer who is a lifelong Doncaster supporter. Tomlinson . played for their reserve side against Scunthorpe earlier this year and . had been close to a takeover before, but a move was twice delayed . because of negotiations over image rights. They . had been resolved and Ryan, the lesser known of the two men, would have . been the more hands-on. The businessman has extensive football experience and oversaw Doncaster's rise from non-league to the Championship as well as their move from Belle Vue to the Keepmoat Stadium before stepping aside in November to allow Terry Bramall and Dick Watson to take over. The initial snag had related to Tomlinson's image rights, which are owned by his management team and would entitle them to a share of any money generated from the use of his image or name. They believe that interest in the club will increase as a result of Tomlinson's ownership and it is understood they battled for a share of any extra revenue made through merchandise and extra ticket sales. Tomlinson signed on as a player at the start of last season in a move to make money for the Bluebell Wood charity and turned out in front of nearly 10,000 fans for the reserve team in February. By a strange quirk, Ryan has also played for Doncaster, with the then 52-year-old having brought himself on as a substitute in a 4-2 win against Hereford which came after his club had sealed promotion from the Conference in 2003.","Lack of funding leaves One Direction singer's takeover in 'serious doubt'

"By . John Mcgarry . Another difficult foreign assignment. Another remarkable performance and result from Tommy Wright’s indefatigable  St Johnstone. The Scottish Cup holders didn’t quite match their victories in Trondheim and Grodno of a year ago but this was still an outcome to be treasured for all concerned. Looking every inch seasoned European campaigners, the men from Perth sucked up just about everything a lively Lucerne side could throw at them before daring to grab the away goal that gives them reason to believe in a week’s time. Get in: Steven MacLean (centre) watches as his effort beats the Lucerne defence and keeper . Joy: MacLean celebrates the vital away goal as St Johnstone put in a superb display in Lucerne . Response: Schneuwly's scrappy goal meant that Saints could only return level for the second leg . Steven MacLean, the scorer against Minsk a year ago and the man who finished the job in the Scottish Cup Final against Dundee United, added another memorable strike to his growing collection with a goal shortly after the interval that temporarily winded the Swiss. Truthfully, it would have been harsh on the home side had they lost on the night but the scrappy manner of Marco Schneuwly’s equaliser will rankle with  the Scots as they make their way home this morning. But it’s unquestionably advantage  St Johnstone now. And, provided they display the same nous and discipline they oozed here, there is no reason to believe a third successive European adventure will end here. The 17,000 capacity Swissporarena — a larger, sun-kissed version of Almondvale — made for a scenic  setting for Saints’ first competitive  outing since their Cup triumph. Important: Schneuwly celebrates his leveller, which was probably no less than the home side deserved . Lucerne (4-2-3-1): Zibung; Rogulj, Doubai, (Bento 60) Lustenberger, Hyka (Bozanic 67); Thiesson, Schneuwly; Affolter, Winter, Wiss, (Lezcano 60); Freuler. Subs not used: Holenstein, Bucchi, Hochstrasser, Sarr.Booked: Lustenberger.St Johnstone (4-5-1): Mannus; Miller, Mackay, Wright, B Easton; Wotherspoon, Millar, Caddis, (O’Halloran 67) Brown, Croft (Scobbie 89); MacLean. Subs not used: Banks, May, Rodger, Kane, D Easton.Booked: Wright, Wotherspoon, Easton.Referee: Benoit Bastien (Fra). Attendance: 8,902. Mercifully for the Scots, the oppressive heat of the afternoon had relented somewhat come kick-off and the sight of the surface largely enveloped in shade was welcome. Lucerne might not be as big a name as the Rosenborg side Saints defeated a year ago, but a fourth-place finish in their league last season underscored the scale of the task. Wright opted not to risk talismanic striker Stevie May on account of a thigh injury meaning MacLean was handed the sole striker role ahead of a compact five-man midfield. The Saints boss had identified the diminutive Jahmir Hyka as the man his side had to watch and the winger soon showed why — forcing an early stop from goalkeeper Alan Mannus after floating away from Gary Miller then having a low strike blocked by the defender’s outstretched leg. That aside, the Perth men looked comparatively comfortable in the early exchanges. Backing: Plenty of St Johnstone fans made the trip to Switzerland to see their team get a good draw . Battling hard: St Johnstone were disciplined throughout and played like European veterans . Wright was frustrated that his side didn’t make their height superiority count at two dangerous set plays and gradually the Swiss awoke from their slumbers. St Johnstone passed up several opportunities to clear their lines and were relieved to see Remo Freuler flash a shot over the  top after an almighty goalmouth scramble. Adrian Winter then eliminated Saints’ defender Brian Easton with a beautifully-crafted diagonal and only Mannus’ fingertips prevented Hyka’s volley rocketing into the net. As the home side cranked up the pressure, Schneuwly fizzed a  20-yarder off the crossbar with  Mannus this time looking every inch a beaten man. Saints briefly bought themselves some respite with a cleverly worked free-kick. Wotherspoon looked to have overcooked his cross to the far post but Dave Mackay had timed his run to perfection. Clearly taken by surprise, keeper David Zibung threw out his right hand to prevent the skipper’s hooked volley beating him at his near post. Up for the fight: David Wotherspoon battles with Lucerne's Jahmir Hyka in the Swissporarena . The sound of the half-time whistle was still music to the ears of the Scottish Cup holders. Another gem of a cross by Hyka picked out Freuler and only Easton’ s intelligent  positioning on the line maintained parity. Saints were well disciplined, although Frazer Wright could have no gripe when he picked up the only booking of the first half after taking out Winter following a clumsy touch on the halfway line. The travelling party would have spent the interval praying for the same blank score come time up, so they were in clover when MacLean edged them in front three minutes after the break. It stemmed from David  Wotherspoon’s deep in-swinging corner which caught Lucerne defender Francois Affolter off guard. MacLean’s initial attempt to guide the ball home was blocked by the defender but he kept his cool, and arrowed the ball into the far corner of the net. The blue section of the stadium exploded with joy. It might even have better before the hour-mark. Mackay’s header looked in all the way until Affolter swept it to safety from under his bar. Something to defend: Lee Croft holds off a Lucerne player - St Johnstone will have to do the same next week . All Wright on the night: Saints boss Tommy Wright applauds the travelling fans on a good night for his side . With the game stretched, the base of the post denied Kaja Rogulj’s header after the defender had bounded forward to connect with Winter’s centre. Wotherspoon and Easton’s bookings were indicative of Saints’ increasing anxiety and on 68  minutes they could hold back the tide no more. An untidy sequence of play ended with Schneuwly being fed with his back to goal on the penalty spot. With Mackay for company, he bobbed and weaved to create  half-a-yard and produced an incisive finish on the turn to square the game. Substitute Dario Lezcano rippled the side-netting with the aid of a Wright deflection then made a  rickets of an Oliver Bozanic cross with the goal at his mercy. But the Scots were not to be denied a result that promises so much for the return in Perth.","Steven MacLean gives St Johnstone the lead .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Created: . 14:04 EST, 27 February 2014 . Thug: Ikramul Hoque, 19, who has been jailed for three years and four months after setting fire to a homeless man's sleeping bag . A teenager who said 'let's set that guy on fire' and laughed as he torched a homeless man's sleeping bag was today jailed for three years. A court heard that Ikramul Hoque, 19, thought it was funny to set fire to rough sleeper Christopher Bloomfield, who had bedded down for the night in the entrance to Reading Central Library. Homeless Mr Bloomfield described waking up to the feeling that his 'feet were melting' as he discovered that his sleeping bag and possessions were engulfed in flames. Sentencing Hoque to three years and four months at a Young Offenders' Institute, Judge Nicholas Wood told him: 'Christopher Bloomfield was a vulnerable, defenceless man. 'Life on the streets must have been difficult and dangerous at the best of times and Mr Bloomfield was entitled to protection. 'He thought the library doorway was a safe refuge, but it wasn't, because of you. 'He woke up to find pain in his feet and his sleeping bag on fire. That must have been terrifying moment. He said his feet felt like they were burning. 'It was your idea, you thought setting fire to the occupant of the sleeping bag was funny and were laughing.' Autistic Hoque, who also suffers from Tourettes and ADHD, according to his defence, admitted starting the fire but told police he thought it was just a pile of rubbish. But CCTV images played to the court showed Mr Bloomfield moving around inside the sleeping bag in the entrance of Reading Central Library at around 9.40pm on May 21, last year. Hoque then walked up to the sleeping tramp, crouched down and lit a corner of his bedding with a cigarette lighter. As the flames began to spread he fled the scene. CCTV evidence: Hoque admitted starting the fire but told police he thought it was just a pile of rubbish. But CCTV images clearly showed Christopher Bloomfield bedding down moments earlier outside a library . Moments later, Mr Bloomfield awoke in agony and a passer-by who had rushed to his aid helped him to put out the fire. Sandra Beck, prosecuting, said Mr Bloomfield was lucky to have suffered only minor injuries. Hoque had been out in Reading town centre with friend when he decided to turn arsonist after smoking cannabis and drinking three bottles of lager. 'All I saw was rubbish,' said Hoque at an earlier hearing at Reading Crown Court. 'That's what I thought in my head. 'I was just left there in the middle of nowhere. 'I couldn't see anything, any form or shape of person.' He tried to defend his actions claiming: 'I was high at the time. I can't remember.' Hoque pictured with supporters outside Reading Crown Court: He initially denied being in the area but then admitted arson being reckless as to the risk of endangering life. His mother cried as he was led away . At an early hearing Reading Crown Court heard how Hoque walked back to his friend laughing. Hoque initially denied being in the area but admitted arson being reckless as to the risk of endangering life. Benjamin Thiele-Long, defending, said Hoque suffered from autism, ADHD and tourettes. The defendant's mother sobbed in the public gallery at Reading Crown Court as the teenager, from Whitley, near Reading, Berkshire, was led to the cells. Hoque, who appeared in court wearing a black Puffa jacket, bowed his head as the judge delievered his sentence. A friend blew a kiss from the public gallery as he was taken away.","Ikramul Hoque, 19, jailed for three years after admitting arson .

"By . Mark Duell . Horrid: Jake Keating, 20, of Liverpool, said he found the body of a wasp in his Dairy Milk Bar . These shocking pictures show how a student discovered a wasp in his Cadbury Dairy Milk bar. Jake Keating, 20, of Liverpool, claimed he found the body of the insect inside the chocolate bar after buying it in the city centre last week. The construction management student at Liverpool John Moores University kept the bar, took a photograph of it and contacted Cadbury. He said: ‘I was in the city centre when I unwrapped the bar and found this wasp inside. 'We kept the bar all day because I thought we should send it back.

"By . Mike Dawes . Tyson Fury has been charged with misconduct by the British Boxing Board of Control following his behaviour at Monday's press conference with Dereck Chisora. The two British heavyweights came together in Kensington to promote their upcoming July 26 bout in Manchester but the event turned sour with Fury launching a string of expletives at both his opponent and one of the journalists in attendance. When the journalist questioned whether Fury had any respect for the sport or the members of the public in attendance, the 25-year-old responded: 'If you don't like the station, change the channel b****. Let's shake on it: Dereck Chisora and Tyson Fury go head-to-head as they shake hands on a side-bet . Controversial: The press conference was marred by Fury's bad language which he has now apologised for . 'This is my show, I do what I want. This is boxing, it isn't tap-dancing. If anybody doesn't like that they shouldn't be here. 'I'm in fight mode, kill-mode. I don't apologise, it is what it is.' Fury also used less than civilised language when addressing Chisora and in reference to IBF, WBA and WBO champion Wladimir Klitschko, prompting the BBBofC to take action. 'The British Boxing Board of Control considered the behaviour of boxer Tyson Fury at the press conference for his forthcoming contest against Dereck Chisora,' read a statement on www.bbbofc.com. Attracting attention: The two men are trying to get attention for the fight which has been overshadowed by other sporting events this summers such as the football World Cup . 'The stewards have decided to call Mr. Fury before them under Regulation 25 (misconduct) to their next meeting on Wednesday, 13th August 2014 when this matter will be dealt with.

"Television coverage of the Commonwealth Games opening ceremony is under threat after BBC workers announced a 12-hour strike. Thousands of journalists and technicians at the corporation will walk out next Wednesday, jeopardising coverage of the flagship event that evening. Singers Rod Stewart, Susan Boyle and Amy Macdonald will join 3,000 volunteer performers for the ceremony at Glasgow’s Celtic Park, watched by a global TV audience of one billion. Thousands of journalists and technicians at the corporation will walk out next Wednesday, jeopardising coverage of the opening ceremony. Pictured, an artist's impression of Celtic Park during the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. But the BBC’s coverage of the event, hosted by Gary Lineker, Hazel Irvine and Clare Balding, is now at risk after members of the NUJ, Bectu and Unite unions voted in favour of industrial action, to run from midday to midnight on Wednesday, in a dispute over pay. Last night the corporation was unable to say whether or not viewers face a blackout, and whether or not emergency staff would be drafted in. Critics have attacked the decision, describing the walkout as unnecessary. Scottish Tory sports spokesman Liz Smith said: ‘The news of this strike is extremely disappointing, especially because it is clearly deliberately timed  to coincide with the launch of the  Commonwealth Games. ‘There is absolutely no need for this strike to go ahead. ‘When athletes have given up so much to train and prepare for the opportunity of a lifetime, the various unions are preparing to strike, which has the potential to cause completely unnecessary unrest just when the Games are beginning.’ The BBC¿s coverage of the event, hosted by Gary Lineker, Hazel Irvine and Clare Balding, is now at risk after members of the NUJ, Bectu and Unite unions voted in favour of industrial action . The turnout for the NUJ ballot has not been disclosed, but 77 per cent of its members voted for strike action. Some 79 per cent of Bectu staff came out in favour but it is understood only 42 per cent of BBC members voted in its ballot. Campaigners said journalists at the corporation have seen a 10 per cent pay cut in real terms over the past five years and that too much is being spent on salaries and perks for managers. NUJ general secretary Michelle Stanistreet described the turnout in the strike ballot as ‘decisive’, adding that the result ‘clearly  demonstrates that journalists across the BBC are not prepared to put up with paltry pay deals any longer’. She added: ‘Members are prepared to take sustained action in this dispute and will name further dates if it is not resolved.’ Singers Rod Stewart (left) and Amy Macdonald (right) will join 3,000 volunteer performers for the ceremony . Gerry Morrissey, general secretary of Bectu, said: ‘The BBC can find money for vanity projects but cannot find money for its own staff, whose pay has dropped by 10 per cent in the past five years.’ The BBC has offered staff earning less than £50,000 a year an increase of £650, with those earning more than £50,000 receiving £500 - although that excludes senior managers. When the Games were hosted by Manchester in 2002, they reached 40.3million people – nearly 73 per cent of the UK population – while the audience peaked at 9.7million for the closing ceremony. The BBC has promised that Glasgow 2014 will be its biggest Commonwealth Games, with 1,300 hours of live coverage. A BBC spokesman said: ‘We will do all we can to bring our audience uninterrupted coverage of the Commonwealth Games. ‘We will continue to speak to the unions in an attempt to resolve this dispute. However, we have made an improved offer and are mindful that we need to make significant savings and deliver more for less.’ A spokesman for Glasgow 2014 and Games Partners said: ‘The BBC are doing all they can to bring full coverage of the Glasgow 2014 Opening Ceremony to audiences.’ VIDEO Best sprinters are in Commonwealth - Fraser-Pryce .","Union walkout could hit coverage of flagship sporting event in Scotland .

"By . Ian Drury . Marine Ashley Hicks died when he fell into the gorge while 'escaping' from other soldiers during a training exercise . A Royal Marine died during a gruelling Special Forces selection exercise when he fell into a mountain gorge which should have been out of bounds. But an inquest heard that the hazard’s name was written in Welsh on a military map – and no one realised the danger. Commando Ashley Hicks fell into the 100ft gorge as he tried to reach a safe point while ‘escaping’ from other soldiers as part of the night-time training mission. A coroner yesterday said the 25-year-old’s death was ‘clearly avoidable’ in a damning finding for military chiefs. Despite recording a verdict of accidental death, she criticised the organisers of the training mission who had failed to notice the danger. On the planning map used to brief troops before the exercise, the word ‘gorge’ was in its Welsh  translation – ‘ceunant’ – so none of the commanders had realised it was a hazard. Coroner Nicola Jones said: ‘Had the gorge been identified in the recce [reconnaissance] procedure it would have been out of bounds and he wouldn’t have been there.The failure to identify this gorge as an unduly hazardous location is clearly the most significant contributing factor to Ashley slipping and falling.’ Acknowledging that lessons had been learned by the military, she went on to say: ‘Crucially, there will be more attempts to gain local specialist knowledge of unacceptable hazards on training grounds in future.’ One SAS soldier, who was giving evidence from behind a screen to protect his identity, told the inquest that the Special Forces now study real-image internet maps before exercises. He said: ‘We are quite proud of our map-reading ability. On this occasion that ability wasn’t good enough.’ Marine Hicks, of Solihull, West Midlands, was killed while taking part in exercises to join an elite Special Forces unit believed to be the SAS. He was part of a team climbing in the notoriously inhospitable area to test their ‘ability to adapt and survive’ in extreme conditions. Marine Hicks volunteered to lead a team through the mountainous region while attempting to ‘evade capture’ from other soldiers. An inquest heard how they had limited equipment for the night-time drill, including a map with ‘little detail’ of the area. Marine Hicks looked at the terrain on Google Maps where he saw the gorge – but identified it as a small riverbed rather than a 100ft drop. Rugged: The military exercise was held in the mountainous region of Snowdonia, North Wales . Seconds after telling his colleagues ‘mind your footing’, he plummeted into Maentwrog Gorge in Snowdonia, North Wales. The drop was not shown on their scale map of the area. When his comrades reached their colleague he was drifting in and out of consciousness and had a weak pulse. A few minutes later he stopped breathing. His comrades carried out CPR on him until a rescue helicopter arrived and he was rushed to Gwynedd Hospital in Bangor, North Wales, where he died. One of the troops, who cannot be named, described the level of risk on the exercise, which took place in October 2012, as ‘acceptable’. But another said the hazardous area would have been placed ‘out of bounds’ had they known about the steep-sided gorge. Last summer three Territorial Army soldiers died in a gruelling SAS selection exercise on the hottest day of the year. They collapsed with heat exhaustion while taking part in the notorious ‘Fan Dance’ march in the  Brecon Beacons. Philippa Tuckman, a military injuries lawyer, said: ‘Once again the MoD has found itself facing serious questions about whether it is properly protecting its soldiers. ‘We have seen time and time again alarming examples which point to unacceptable shortcomings in military practice and a consistent failure by the MoD to observe the duty of care it owes its soldiers. ‘We need to know whether this is another. Soldiers should not die on exercise.’ Marine Hicks’s parents declined to comment after the inquest.","Royal Marine Ashley Hicks fell down gorge during exercise in rugged Wales .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Children should not drink rice milk because it can contain harmful levels of arsenic, scientists have warned. The poison is found naturally in low levels in rice and other plants. Levels can be boosted by the way rice is grown in flooded paddies and by the presence of traces of old pesticides. Parents have been warned not to feed their children rice milk because it can contain harmful levels of arsenic (file picture) Rice bran, from which rice milk is made, carries higher levels than raw polished white rice. The NHS already advises parents not to feed rice milk – often used by those who are lactose-intolerant – to under-fives. Now the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) has extended this to older children. Its report calls for arsenic levels to be regulated in products used by children. Currently arsenic content of foods is not regulated. No ‘safe’ level of exposure can be identified. The NHS already advises parents not to feed rice milk (pictured) ¿ often used by those who are lactose-intolerant ¿ to under-fives . The report says: ‘The risk from consumption of products made from rice bran, such as rice drinks, is much higher than from raw – but polished – white rice.’ As well as being a poison, arsenic is linked to the development of some forms of cancer. Dr Iva Hojsak, of University Children's Hospital Zagreb in Croatia, who led the commentary, said: 'Inorganic arsenic is considered a first level carcinogen and its long-term exposure has negative effects on human health.' Because of its availability, nutritional value and relatively low allergenic potential, rice is a widely used carbohydrate during weaning. Rice and rice products such as starch, flour and syrup are commonly added to infant foods and drinks. The report said: 'That contributes to high exposure of infants and young children to inorganic arsenic which is two to three times higher than in adults.' ESPGHAN says rice-based formulas 'are an option' for infants allergic to cow's milk but their arsenic content should be declared and considered by doctors and parents. Otherwise the organisation recommends avoiding rice drinks for infants and young children and including a variety of other grains in their diets such as oats, barley, wheat and corn. It also calls for further research on the inorganic arsenic content of rice and other foods and its lifelong impact on health.","Scientists have warned that rice milk may contain harmful levels of arsenic .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Football players who suffer concussion should only be allowed back on the pitch after being examined by an independent doctor, say medics. The proposal backs the world players’ union FIFPro, which criticised FIFA over its handling of head injuries during the World Cup and in particular Uruguayan defender Álvaro Pereira overruling his team doctors’ advice to be substituted. In an editorial published in The Lancet Neurology, medics say that FIFA needs to get its house in order before the next World Cup: ‘Changes are clearly needed to protect athletes.’ Alvaro Pereira lies on the ground after taking a blow to the head during Uruguay's game with England during the World Cup . The doctors say players must be taken off if there is any suspicion of head injury as it has been linked to dementia and other problems in later life. Pereira continued playing in the game which saw his Uruguay side beat England “'after a blow to the head that left him in an apparent state of concussion.' As a result FIFPro called on FIFA to 'conduct a thorough investigation into its own competition concussion protocol which failed to protect' the Uruguayan. It called for 'a review of the laws of the game so that a player with a suspected concussion can be temporarily replaced whilst being diagnosed.' It stressed: 'The World Cup must set the standard for player health and safety to educate the international football community. Doctors say players must be taken off the pitch if there is any suspicion of head injury . 'Medical evidence shows that a person faces the risk of very serious brain injury, or worse, if he or she suffers a severe head trauma from a concussive blow. 'Football is awash with incidents in which players suffer potentially concussive blows to the head and stay on the pitch. In Pereira’s case, he demanded to play on while overruling advice from Uruguay’s team physician for him to be immediately substituted. 'FIFPro understands that in the heat of the moment, faced by the pressures of such an important international stage, many players would react in this way, but there are times when the players also need protection from making any rash decisions. 'Furthermore, FIFPro states any sideline concussion assessment must not be conducted solely by a national team physician.' England player Raheem Sterling ran into Pereira knocking the defender in the face with his knee . It said if there is any suspicion of injury the only safe thing would be to take players off as a range of symptoms can last for weeks or months afterwards and has been linked to dementia in later life. It said: 'Cerebral concussion is the most common form of sports-related traumatic brain injury (TBI) and there is growing recognition of the lasting effects of mild TBI. 'A range of symptoms such as headache and dizziness can continue for weeks or even months after a concussion; the causes of post-concussion syndrome are unclear and do not seem to correlate with the severity of injury.' Medics said the long-term consequences of repeated mild TBI have been recognised for some time in the boxing world where symptoms of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), including dementia, appears years or decades after brain trauma. Despite the collision, Pereira refused to leave the field and carried on playing for the rest of the match . The editorial called for better education to prevent, recognise and respond to the effects of mild head injuries in sport while more research into the short and long-term effects of mild TBI was needed. It added: 'Concussion signs and symptoms are not necessarily sensitive indicators of brain injury and we know that these symptoms can pass quickly even when neurological damage remains. 'Advanced neuroimaging and biomarkers are needed to diagnose and monitor CTE - characterised by progressive tauopathy and neurodegeneration - during life. 'Gives us hope that when teams gather in four year’s time for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, football and other sports will feel a safer place for athletes of all ages.'","Proposal has been backed by the world players' union FIFPro .

"Long-term smokers find the taste of cigarettes they bought in plain-packaged cigarettes to be worse than branded cigarettes. A study of 51 smokers by the University of Newcastle also found that participants can no longer differentiate between brands, saying that since the introduction of plain packaging in Australia in 2012, all cigarettes now tasted the same. The study's co-author and PhD candidate, Ashleigh Guillaumier, said because tobacco companies have denied changing the ingredients in their products, the study's findings highlight the power of branding. A study involving 51 long-term smokers found that participants found the taste of plain-packaged cigarettes to be worse than branded cigarettes . 'It's one of the main reasons that the tobacco industry fought so hard against the introduction of plain packets,' said Ms Guillaumier. 'They have spent a lot of time building up their branding and know how influential it is on people's perceptions and experience of the product.' The researchers investigated the impact of the new one-colour packets dominated by vivid health warnings by conducting group discussions with smokers before and after plain packaging was introduced on December 1, 2012. 'They couldn't discern a difference between brands now and they thought the quality of the tobacco had deteriorated,' Ms Guillaumier said. It also found that participants can no longer differentiate between brands, saying that all cigarettes now tasted the same . 'That was a consistent talking point that people really agreed on in the groups sessions.' Co-author Associate Professor Billie Bonevski said the study supports the introduction of plain packaging legislation and provides ammunition for other countries that want to take up the policy. Conducted by the University of Newcastle (pictured), the study correlates with figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics which show a significant decrease in tobacco sales since the introduction of plain packaging . The Australian Bureau of Statistics has released figures which appear to show a significant decrease in tobacco sales since their introduction. In December of 2012, figures show that $3.508 billion was spent by consumers on tobacco. In March of this year, the expenditure on tobacco products was $3.405 billion. But the three major Australian Tobacco companies - British American Tobacco Australasia, Philip Morris Australia and Imperial Tobacco Australia - have all seen a 30 percent jump in profit since the hardline plain packaging laws were introduced.

"By . Daniel Martin . Controversial: The health watchdog NICE has called for more obese people with the condition to be considered for a gastric band or bypass . Free weight-loss surgery could be offered to nearly a million diabetes patients. The health watchdog yesterday called for more obese people with the condition to be considered for a gastric band or bypass. At a stroke, NICE’s ruling doubles to 1.8million the numbers qualifying for taxpayer-funded surgery. But campaigners said it was wrong to offer operations costing £5,000 when the NHS faces a £30billion deficit and NICE is denying cancer patients life-extending drugs. They warned the obese should instead be told to eat less and exercise more. ‘We’ve got a mismatch between what NICE recommends and what the country can afford,’ said Tam Fry of the National Obesity Forum. ‘Thousands of people will look at this and say – I fit that criteria, I want the surgery. This is going to stretch clinical commissioning groups to the limit – we’ve got a creaking Health Service as it is. We could end up with a situation where clinical commissioning groups say we can’t get the extra midwives we need for the local hospital, we can’t pay for life-saving drugs for people with cancer – because other people have been given the right to have expensive bariatric surgery.’ The surgery covers procedures including gastric bands and gastric bypasses, where the digestive system is rerouted past most of the stomach. NICE said a gastric bypass on the NHS costs £5,410 and a gastric band £2,473. Weight-loss surgery is given to patients who are morbidly obese with a body mass index score of more than 40. It is also offered to those who have a BMI over 35 with another serious health condition, such as type 2 diabetes. Around a million people qualify under these rules – although in practice only around 10,000 operations are carried out every year. But now NICE is suggesting that diabetics with a BMI score of 30 or more should be considered for an assessment for weight-loss operations on the NHS. Diabetes UK says the new rules mean between 850,000 and 900,000 extra people could qualify. Rise: The ruling would double the number of people who could qualify for taxpayer-funded surgery to 1.8million . It will be up to individual clinical commissioning groups, which hold local NHS budgets, to decide whether the surgery should be funded in their areas. Britain is in the grip of an obesity epidemic and 2.9million people now have diabetes, a condition which in its type 2 form is linked to poor lifestyle. Mark Baker, director of clinical practice at NICE, said: ‘Obesity rates have nearly doubled over the past ten years and continue to rise, making obesity and overweight a major issue for the Health Service. ‘Updated evidence suggests people who are obese and have been recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes may benefit from weight loss surgery. More than half of people who undergo surgery have more control over their diabetes following surgery and are less likely to have diabetes-related illness; in some cases surgery can even reverse the diagnosis.’ NICE says that by losing weight patients can reduce the damaging consequences of diabetes, such as the risk of blindness or heart attack. Its guidance states that an operation is repaid in savings to the NHS within three years. After that, there are gains of around £4,000 per year per patient. But Roger Goss of Patient Concern said: ‘NICE doesn’t seem to know the NHS is heading for a deficit. They are wasting our money. Obese people should be encouraged to eat less and take more exercise – rather than having this expensive treatment paid for.’ Simon O’Neill, from the charity Diabetes UK, said: ‘Bariatric surgery should only be considered as a last resort if serious attempts to lose weight have been unsuccessful and if the person is obese. ‘It can lead to dramatic weight loss, which in turn may result in a reduction in people taking their type 2 diabetes medication and even in some people needing no medication at all. This does not mean, however, that type 2 diabetes has been cured. ‘These people will still need to eat a healthy balanced diet and be physically active.’ The BMI score is a simple measure based on height and weight with a score higher than 25 indicating overweight and 30 or more being judged as obese.","Watchdog believes more people should be considered for gastric bands .

'Summer temperatures in most American cities are going to feel like summers now in Texas andFlorida - very, very hot,' said Alyson Kenward of Climate Central, lead researcher of the analysis, which looked at projected changes in average summer (June-July-August) high temperatures. On average, those temperatures will be 7-10°F warmer with some cities as much as 12°F hotter by the end of the century. 'In some cases, summers will warm so dramatically that their best comparison is to cities in the Middle East, it said. 'Take Las Vegas, for example.

The Turin side announced that Allegri . will be presented on Wednesday afternoon, ahead of the start of their . pre-season training. Conte, who was under contract with Juve for a further season, surprisingly stepped down on Tuesday just one day into the Bianconeri's pre-season preparations. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Allegri give his first interview as Juventus head coach . Replacement: Allegri (left) has been chosen to succeed Conte (right) after his surprise resignation . New face: Allegri will have a job in his hands keeping hold of the likes of Paul Pogba and Arturo Vidal . Much to ponder: Allegri has been out of a job since January, when he was sacked by AC Milan . Andrea Pirlo could be on the move from Juventus following the appointment of Allegri. The Italy midfielder revealed he left AC Milan because Allegri did not consider him part of his first-team plans. 'The real reason why I left Milan was because Allegri wanted to use Massimo Ambrosini or Mark Van Bommel in front of the defence instead of me.'That meant that I had to change position on the pitch. So I said ‘no thanks’ to Milan and chose Juventus.' The 46-year-old Allegri has been out of a job since being dismissed by Milan in January, with the Rossoneri in the midst of a nightmare season when they trailed Juve by as many as 30 points.

"By . Julian Robinson . A woman born with no ears has heard the sound of her voice for the first time – after having them rebuilt and fitted with a hi-tech hearing aid. Sally Evans, of Gosport, Hampshire, was born with microtia, a congenital deformity which resulted in her right ear being a flap of skin and the left sealing over completely. But the 35-year-old has undergone pioneering work to have a special hearing aid fitted. The Bone Anchored Hearing Aid works by detecting sound and sending vibrations down a screw embedded in the bone – straight to the hearing nerve, bypassing the ear canal. Sally Evans is pictured with her new hearing aid and the reconstructed ear which was made using parts of her rib cartilage . When the device was switched on, the A&E nurse heard herself speak for the first time. In a second procedure, parts of her own rib cartilage were removed and reshaped to sculpt new prosthetic ears. The work came about after Dr Dawn Harper from Channel 4’s Embarrassing Bodies visited the mother-of-two's workplace at Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth, Hampshire. Colleagues spoke to Dr Dawn and asked whether anything to be done. She agreed to meet Mrs Evans and her story is set to feature on the show tonight. Describing the moment she first heard the sound of her own voice, Mrs Evans said: ‘That day in the sound proofed room will stay with me forever. ‘In that moment my world got so much bigger, it was like being a child again and hearing things for the first time. Dr Dawn Harper, left, from Channel 4's Embarrassing Bodies arranged for Sally Evans, right, to be fitted with a new hearing aid . 'I was so emotional and cried with . happiness - my first words were “is that me, is that my voice I can hear . - do I sound like that? ‘I could hear the carpet on the floor when my feet moved across it - my husband had to tell me what it was because I had never heard it before. 'I could hear sounds from all directions and I hadn’t realised how loud the world is. ‘Every day there is always something new I hear like my cat purring or the sound of the sea. It is all magical to me.’ When Sally Evans was born, one of her ears was completely sealed while another was just a tiny flap of skin, pictured . After the hearing aid was fitted, Mrs Evans saw Greg O’Toole, a Consultant Plastic and Reconstructive surgeon who performed surgery at the Royal Free Hospital in London, to rebuild her ears. Half of her head was shaved to access her scalp and she later decided to shave her hair completely and wear a wig until she had made a full recovery. It marked a turning point for the mother-of-two, who describes on the show how she grew up thinking that nothing could be done about the appearance of her ears and how she was conscious of people staring at her. She wore her hair down to cover her missing ears and had to travel 20 miles in a taxi to a school with a unit for children with hearing problems. ‘Growing up was very difficult for me, I always was aware that people looked at me differently,' she said. 'This journey is the beginning of a dream I never thought possible, originating from a chance meeting. 'I never ever thought one day I could have ears of my own that were real – my family, husband and my girls have been my rock. 'Without them this journey would have been incredibly tough but with their love and support my dreams are becoming reality. 'I came into this world with no ears and whatever else happens I’ll be going out with two.'

To the world U.S. president Franklin Delano Roosevelt was a pillar of strength and vitality; a robust leader who navigated America through two of the greatest crises of the 20th century - the Great Depression and World War Two. But away from the cameras he was unable to walk more than a few yards without help. Even then each step seemed a punishing exertion, both physically and mentally, forcing him to spend most of his time confined to a wheelchair. Scroll down for video . Exposed: Gripping an aide's arm for support as he hobbles up a ramp, this is the rarest of glimpses into the secret that the world's most powerful man was desperate to hide . Rare footage: Filmed in 1937 in Harrisburg, PA, by Major . League Baseball pitcher Jimmie DeShong, . this is only the second piece of footage of the four-term president on . his feet ever to be unearthed . He was so keen to keep his frailty hidden from the American public, that only one video has ever been released of him walking . . .  until now. Filmed in 1937 in Harrisburg, PA, by Major League Baseball pitcher Jimmie DeShong, this is only the second piece of footage of the four-term president on his feet ever to be unearthed. Punishing: But away from the cameras he was unable to walk more than a few yards without help. Even then each step seemed a punishing exertion, both physically and mentally . Revealed today by the . Pennsylvania State Archives, it was recorded 16 years after FDR . was paralysed from the waist down by a bout of polio while holidaying . with his family in Canada. One of Franklin D. Roosevelt's greatest diplomatic masterstrokes was convincing Winston Churchill and Josef Stalin to pose for a picture together, sitting down. By February 1945, FDR was suffering from a weak heart and was so frail he was barely able to stand. Still he attended the Yalta Conference so he, Winston Churchill and Josef Stalin could discuss how to reorganise Europe after the Second World War. The agreement they reached was instrumental to the partitioning of Germany and the inception of the United Nations. But fearing he would look weak next to his robust British and Soviet counterparts if pictured sitting while they stood, he persuaded them both to take a seat for the final photo call. The result was one of the most iconic political photographs of the 20th century. That photo call - one of only two that included all three leaders - was the last Roosevelt would attend. He looked pallid and frail as his health had already begun to fail him. He died two months later. As a result he was unable to walk without leg braces or assistance. During his four terms as president, Roosevelt often used a wheelchair in private, but not for public appearances. News photographers cooperated in concealing Roosevelt's disability, and those who did not found their camera views blocked by Secret Service agents. 'In some instances, they confiscated cameras and film to protect his image,' said Jim Vaughn, Executive Director of the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission. 'They worked really hard for people not to think of their president as paralyzed.' 'This was home movies,' DeShong's grandson, Mike Savastio, told ABC affiliate WHTM. 'We’d get together at my mom’s house and they would come over and put up a reel and we’d watch it in our living room.' Filmmaker Ken Burns, who is using it in . his upcoming documentary 'The Roosevelts: An Intimate History', said: . 'We were thrilled with the discovery of a new piece of film footage of . Franklin Delano Roosevelt walking. 'Any film . of him struggling to get from one place to another is extremely rare, as . the Secret Service either prohibited or confiscated cameras whenever . FDR was making an attempt to propel himself from his car to anywhere . else. 'The President wanted to minimize the . public's knowledge of the devastating effects polio had had on him. 'He . was completely paralyzed from the waist down and he could not walk . without the aid of a cane and braces on both legs. 'The press in those . days complied with his request not to be filmed.' Franklin D. Roosevelt died in April 1945, two months after the historic Yalta Conference in which he, Britain's Winston Churchill and Soviet leader Josef Stalin agreed a plan for Europe's reorganisation following the end of the Second World War. Figure of strength: To the world U.S. president Franklin Delano Roosevelt was a pillar of strength and vitality; a robust leader who navigated America through two of the greatest crises of the 20th century - the Great Depression and World War Two . Close allies: While the meeting of the 'Big Three' happened only twice, FDR and Churchill became close allies, convening on 11 separate occasions. Never once, were they photographed standing up . He looked pallid and frail as his health had already begun to fail him. In fact, unbeknownst to the world, he had . been in declining health already for five years, having been diagnosed . with high blood pressure, atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease . causing angina pectoris, and congestive heart failure. Nevertheless, . he refused to give in to his ailing body, and may even have used his . authority over the Office of Censorship to suppress news reports on his . declining health before the 1944 election that won him a fourth term in . office.","It was filmed by MLB pitcher Jimmie DeShong in Harrisburg, PA, in 1937 .

"By . Matthew Blake . YouTube has helped police in Spain seize a fleet of super-powered speedboats used to smuggle drugs into the country from Morocco. Police said they were tipped off to the gang's activities after a speed freak impressed by the high power machines uploaded on to the site pictures of the jet black high-powered speed boats in the area. Senior detectives saw them, realised they were probably being used to run drugs, and after an undercover probe, impounded them. Scroll down for video .

I'm sure all three are going to have massive success in what they do next , but now is the time to thank them all for everything they did last year.' The decision to dismiss Abdul has surprised many, given how hard Cowell worked to secure her on the panel. It took several months for her contract to negotiated and she only closed her deal hours before the first televised audition.

"By . Chris Foy . Follow @@FoyChris . England struggled to get going on their tour of New Zealand, losing every game in a 3-0 whitewash. Here, Sportsmail's Chris Foy offers his verdict on all of Stuart Lancaster's men. The All Blacks began the series with a narrow 20-15 victory in Auckland, before an incredibly narrow 28-27 victory in the second Test secured overall victory. And a 36-13 romp in the final game ensured that England would return to the Northern Hemisphere empty handed. New Zealand have now won 17 tests in a row, equalling a record set by themselves in the 1960s, and equalled by South Africa between 1997-98.

"By . Chris Pleasance . The mother of tortured child Baby P has been receiving taxpayer-funded lessons in how to be a good parent, it was reported today. Tracey Connelly, 32, is being taught childcare skills along with literacy, numeracy and healthy living skills, it has been claimed. It comes just two weeks after she was released early from a minimum five-year jail sentence for allowing her son to be tortured to death. Tracey Connelly (left), mother of tortured baby Peter (right), has allegedly been receiving childcare lessons at taxpayers' expense. She was jailed in 2009 for causing or allowing his death . The mother is receiving the lessons at a bail hostel where she is monitored 24 hours a day by CCTV. The lessons will last for the length of her stay at the hostel, which is expected to be three to seven months, but may be expended due to the high profile nature of her case. Connelly is reported to be making a new life for herself in the North of England and was seen out laughing and shopping with a friend yesterday in Aldi. She has ballooned to 22 stone while serving time in Durham jail, and last night her mother spoke of the shock of seeing her daughter's appearance. Speaking to The Sun Mary O'Connor, 53, said: 'I cried when I saw [her]. She's changed so much - it's the largest I've seen her. 'I guess she's smiling because she's just out of prison. She probably thinks she's safe up there.' Steven Barker (left), partner of Tracey Connelly, and Jason Owen (right), his paedophile brother, were also jailed . Connelly was jailed indefinitely in 2009 after she admitted doing nothing while her little boy was tortured to death by her boyfriend Steven Barker and his paedophile brother Jason Owen. Peter was found dead in his blood-spattered cot at his mother's flat in Tottenham, north London, after suffering 50 injuries, including a broken back. The case provoked a national scandal after it emerged that social workers, police and doctors missed a series of warning signs that could have saved the child's life. As she was granted parole, Connelly had begged for an anonymity order and round-the-clock police protection, but ministers refused. These orders are rare and only four are currently in force. These apply to child killer Mary Bell, James Bulger's murderers Robert Thompson and Jon Venables and to Maxine Carr, who provided a false alibi for Soham murderer Ian Huntley. Instead, Connelly has been given a new name and released in an area far from Haringey, where Peter was killed. A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice refused to comment, saying they did not speak about individual cases.","Tracey Connelly, 32, is 'receiving taxpayer-funded childcare lessons'

"By . Martin Jay . Justin Bieber fans have 'converted to Islam' on television in a bid to secure tickets to one of his shows. The fans - known as 'beliebers' - tried to see their Canadian hero in concert by taking part in the stunt on Norwegian station TV Norge. The girls were told to remove all make-up, put on hijabs and recite what was reported to be an Islamic statement of belief in Arabic before reading a piece of Arabic text aloud. Girls 'converted to Islam' in a Norwegian television stunt in a bid to win tickets to see Justin Bieber, pictured performing at the Telenor Arena, during the Norwegian leg of his 'Believe' tour . Norwegian news website Dagen reported that the fans were also made to say: 'Justin Bieber is unclean and probably gay'. The stunt featured on the comedy show called 'Anne-Kat', hosted by award-winning comedienne Anne-Katrine Hegna Hærland. She said: 'We wanted to find out how far Norwegian ""beliebers"" are willing to go for tickets to one of Bieber’s concerts.' The show has been heavily criticised by faith leaders, who said it trivialises people's faith. The controversy comes weeks after Bieber was dubbed 'insensitive' after leaving a message in a guestbook while visiting Anne Frank's house . in Amsterdam. The star . wrote in the log: 'Truly inspiring to be able to come here. Anne was a . great girl. Hopefully she would have been a Belieber.' Faith leaders have criticised the stunt - the latest controversy to surround the Canadian during his world tour . Reports in the Middle East speculated that Bieber is planning to buy a home in Dubai . Halyor Northug, Bishop of the Norwegian . Lutheran Church, told Dagen that the stunt on 'Anne-Kat' 'testifies to Hærland’s . lack of understanding of how much faith means to a lot of people.' He . added: 'This is an example of an idea where irony and lack of . respect turns into something tragic.' Bieber is hugely popular in Norway and last year authorities in Oslo almost declared a state of emergency in the capital city as thousands of youngsters flocked to a free concert. This year, several Norwegian schools rescheduled their midterms to accommodate students with tickets to Bieber's recent performances. The Canadian superstar hit the headlines recently after he posted a racy cartoon depicting himself in . bed with a naked girl lying on his chest with the words 'Justin . Belieber' emblazoned across the top on Wednesday. He also cancelled a gig in Oman after it was reported authorities said his performances were 'too sexy.' Middle East websites are now speculating that the superstar wants to live in Dubai, after he added another concert date in the city. After splashing a £4.2 million in California on his first home last year, reports suggest Bieber wants a place in Dubai so he can stay there when he plays on May 4 and 5, and keep his options open should he ever fancy a move to the emirate. An obvious choice for the teen heartthrob might be an apartment in the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world where properties cost about £4.5 million.","The 'Beliebers' were told to put on hijabs and recite supposed Islamic text .

"By . Meghan Keneally . Pastor Rick Warren has announced a new diet book that he has written combining nutritional tips and biblical lessons to help heavy congregants lose weight. The pastor lost 65 pounds by sticking with a tailored diet plan in 2011 but then gained just over half of that back after his 27-year-old son killed himself earlier this year. Warren, who heads a group of California megachurches, became a best-selling author with his book 1995 The Purpose Driven Life, but now he teamed up with a group of doctors to turn his focus towards congregants' physical health and created 'The Daniel Plan'. Leading by example: Rick Warren said he had been gaining weight steadily for years (pictured at left in 2008 and right this October) but started actively dieting in 2011 . 'You think that God is only interested in your soul? No, he is interested in your body, mind and soul. Jesus went into each village teaching, preaching and healing. The Daniel Plan has to do with healing,' he told USA Today. Helping hand: TV personality Dr Mehmet Oz is one of three doctors that helped Warren develop his diet . 'The Bible says, ""God made my body; Jesus died for my body; the spirit lives in my body."" So I had better take care of it.' Warren's book, which comes out tomorrow, suggests a five-pronged approach that tells followers to seek help with their diet through food, fitness, focus, faith and friends. As with so much of his life, the diet's name is based off scripture: a chapter in the Bible tells how a Jewish noble named Daniel was tasked with eating healthy food as opposed to the rich diet of the king. 'We just took the title from that concept. It doesn't try to follow what Daniel ate, because the Bible doesn't tell us exactly what he ate,' Warren told USA Today. 'The line we use is: ""If it grows on a plant, it's healthy. If it's made in a plant, don't eat it."" My rule is no snacks, no sweets, no seconds.' He first tried losing weight in conjunction with his congregants in 2010 after realizing that so many of them- himself included- were overweight. At the time, the 6-foot 3-inch preacher weighed 295 pounds. He teamed up with Dr Mehmet Oz, Dr Daniel Amen and Dr Mark Hymen to develop the regime that helped him lose nearly a third of his body weight. While the initial development of the . diet started two years ago, he 'relapsed' this spring after his son . Matthew killed himself. Warren and his wife Kay spoke to CNN's Piers Morgan in a tell-all interview months later, opening up about his son's mental illness. ‘The . day that I had feared might happen one day since he'd been born and the . day that I had prayed would never happen, happened,’ he said in . September. Ailing: Warren lost 65 pounds in 2011 but this summer he gained half of that back following the suicide of his son Matthew, which he detailed in an interview alongside his wife Kay in September (pictured) The grief that came after his son's death brought back at least 25 pounds. 'My back went out, and I wasn't able to exercise for an extended period. I didn't feel like doing anything, and our members who are so loving were bringing us meals every night. They weren't necessarily healthy meals. They were rich in creams and enormous portions, far more than we could possibly eat. It was comfort eating. I wasn't making some good choices in terms of what I ate,' he told USA Today. 'I didn't sleep well for months, and when you don't sleep well, your hunger level goes up. I fell off the wagon. All those pounds I had lost kept finding me.'","Pastor Rick Warren realized that he and many of his congregants at Saddleback Church were overweight in 2011 .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . Cleansing: Actress Jane Fonda, seen at this year's Oscars, says she has finally 'made peace' with her body at the age of 75 . After struggling with eating disorders for most of her life, Jane Fonda says she has at last ‘made peace’ with her body. The 75-year-old has twice-daily yoga sessions and recently went through a week-long cleansing regime, avoiding all dairy products, red meat, wheat and coffee. However she claimed she has given up her quest for a perfect figure, saying: ‘For a woman, making peace with your body is a work in progress. 'I have spent time in therapy, written books that have helped me heal – as well as helped others. ‘For me, healing meant understanding that “good enough” is good. We don’t have to be perfect.’ The actress, who won Oscars for her roles in the 1971 movie Klute and Coming Home in 1978, took on the role of fitness guru in 1982 with the release of an aerobics tutorial which became the most successful fitness video of all time. But she later revealed she had suffered eating disorders from the age of 12, veering between a series of food binges and purges. Although she was spotted tucking into a greasy cheeseburger at an Oscars after-party, she insisted she is still devoted to healthy eating. ‘I started the year with a week-long cleanse – no coffee, dairy, red meat or wheat,’ she told Hello! magazine. ‘Instead I had lots of juices, vegetables, chicken and fish, oats, beans and cleansing teas. 'I’m still basically eating that way now, and will probably never go back to coffee. I eat fish, especially salmon and tuna, three times a week. This is really good for older people.’ Miss Fonda recently released a yoga DVD for the elderly – her 27th fitness tutorial – with her partner Richard Perry, 70. She said: ‘Yoga makes me feel great, alive, awake, and as we get older it’s important to stay flexible and strong, which yoga helps with. ‘I’ve had a knee and hip replacement and had major back surgery last March, so my ability to do a full lotus position, for instance, is reduced. But I do this DVD with my boyfriend and it is totally safe.’ She added: ‘There are morning segments . that each work on slightly different areas, designed to wake you up and . get you energised for the day.  Then there are evening segments to calm . you down and ready you for bed.’ Fitness guru: Fonda, pictured in California in 1980, recently released her 27th fitness tutorial, a yoga DVD for the elderly .","Oscar-winning actress has struggled with eating disorders in the past .

"By . Steve Robson . A number of teenagers have fallen ill after a skate park was transformed into a makeshift pool filled with river water. Crowds of young people flocked to the skate park in Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, when word spread that it had somehow been filled with water from the nearby River Calder to cool off. Pictures show at least 20 young people swimming in the dirty, brown water during the recent heatwave. But the decision backfired when several have since fallen ill and are believed to be suffering from sickness and diarrhoea.

"By . Hugo Gye . Pimm's has long been considered the ultimate Wimbledon drink - but punters may be getting less than they bargained for. A glass of the drink costs nearly £8 at the championships, but scientific analysis has revealed that it can be so diluted that it is just 2.5 per cent alcohol. This implies that the Pimm's served at Wimbledon is less than half as strong as is officially recommended - although organisers insist that they are following the manufacturer's guidelines. Scroll down for video . Fan favourite: Pimm's is one of the most popular drinks served at the Wimbledon championships . Pimm's is a gin-based spirit which is traditionally mixed with lemonade before being served in a glass with ice and mixed fruit. The original drink is always 25 per cent ABV, but the alcohol level of the final product can vary hugely depending on how much lemonade and ice are included. Wimbledon claims to sell around 230,000 glasses of Pimm's every year - more than 20,000 a day - at a price of £7.80 per drink from the official bars. The Sunday Times carried out scientific tests on the drinks to determine exactly what punters were getting for their money. At one bar, the glass contained just one part Pimm's to nine parts lemonade and water - meaning it was only 2.5 per cent alcohol. The quantity of Pimm's varied at other bars, but no drink was stronger than 4 per cent. Refreshing: Andy Murray's girlfriend Kim Sears sipping on a Pimm's at Wimbledon in 2009 . The Pimm's served at Wimbledon is provided by the drinks company pre-mixed with lemonade at 5.4 per cent ABV, meaning that it must have been watered down with melted ice before being tested. On the Pimm's website, fans are recommended to use one part spirit to three parts lemonade - making a drink which is 6.25 per cent alcohol. A spokesman for Wimbledon and its contracted caterers told the Sunday Times that customers could request a Pimm's without ice if they did not want to water their drink down. 'The Pimm's comes in pre-mixed sealed containers and we serve it over ice as recommended,' he said. 'The amount of ice in the glass will affect the dilution but you can always ask for it without ice.' A spokesman for Pimm's added that the pre-mixed drink is 'best served over ice'. Some Wimbledon spectators criticised the quality of the Pimm's, comparing to a 'soft drink', but others insisted that it is nonetheless a vital part of a day out at the championships.","Wimbledon sells around 230,000 glasses of Pimm's a year at £7.80 each .

"By . Rob Waugh . Astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope have seen a horrifying glimpse of the destructive power of solar flares, as a huge X-Ray flare 'boiled off' the atmosphere of a distant planet. Our own sun's flares are usually only powerful enough to disrupt radio communications on Earth, but a new sunspot group - AR 1520 - is one of the biggest in years, and may bombard Earth next week. Just . after a violent flare on its parent star bathed it in intense X-ray . radiation, the planet HD 189733b's atmosphere gave off a powerful burst of . evaporation. Hubble found that the planet's upper atmosphere was streaming away at speeds exceeding 300,000 mph. Just before the Hubble observation, NASA's Swift detected the star blasting out a strong X-ray flare, one powerful enough to blow away part of the planet's atmosphere . Boiled off into space: This NASA image shows an artist's rendering which illustrates the evaporation of HD 189733b's atmosphere in response to a powerful eruption from its host star . Flares from our own sun: This Nasa image, from July 11 shows gigantic sunspot AR 1520. One of the biggest sunspots in years, AR1520, is turning toward Earth and harbors energy for strong solar flares . Astronomer . Alain Lecavelier des Etangs and his team used Hubble to observe the . atmosphere of exoplanet HD 189733b during two periods in early 2010 and . late 2011, as it was silhouetted against its parent star. While . backlit in this way, the planet's atmosphere imprints its chemical . signature on the starlight, allowing astronomers to decode what is . happening on scales that are too tiny to image directly. The observations were carried . out in order to confirm what the team had previously seen once before in . a different planetary system: the evaporation of an exoplanet's . atmosphere. HD 189733b has a blue sky, but that's where the similarities with Earth stop. The . planet is a huge gas giant similar to Jupiter, but it lies extremely . close to its star, just one thirtieth the distance Earth is from the . Sun. Even . though its star is slightly smaller and cooler than the Sun, this makes . the planet's climate exceptionally hot, at above 1000 degrees Celsius, . and the upper atmosphere is battered by energetic extreme-ultraviolet . and X-ray radiation. As such, it is an excellent candidate to study the effects of a star on a planetary atmosphere. 'The . first set of observations were actually disappointing,' Lecavelier . said, 'since they showed no trace of the planet's atmosphere at all. We . only realised we had chanced upon something more interesting when the . second set of observations came in.' The . team's follow-up observations, made in 2011, showed a dramatic change, . with clear signs of a plume of gas being blown from the planet at a rate . of at least 1000 tonnes per second. Lecavelier . added: 'We hadn't just confirmed that some planets' atmospheres . evaporate - we had watched the physical conditions in the evaporating . atmosphere vary over time. Nobody had done that before.' Bright spark: In this ESA simulation, the sun flares up as planet HD 189733b transits past . The solar flare left the sun as the planet passed in front of it, from the perspective of Earth's satellites . Despite the extreme temperature of the planet, the atmosphere is not hot enough to evaporate at the rate seen in 2011. Instead . the evaporation is thought to be driven by the intense X-ray and . extreme-ultraviolet radiation from the parent star, HD 189733A, which is . about 20 times more powerful than that of our own Sun. Taking . into account also that HD 189733b is a giant planet very close to its . star, then it must suffer an X-ray dose three million times higher than . the Earth. Evidence to . support X-ray driven evaporation comes from simultaneous observations of . HD 189733A with the Swift satellite, which, unlike Hubble, can observe . the star's atmosphere-frying X-rays. A . few hours before Hubble observed the planet for the second time, Swift . recorded a powerful flash of radiation coming from the surface of the . star, in which the star briefly became 4 times brighter in X-rays. Co-author . Peter Wheatley, from the University of Warwick, said: 'X-ray emissions . are a small part of the star's total output, but it is the part that it . is energetic enough to drive the evaporation of the atmosphere. 'This . was the brightest X-ray flare from HD 189733A of several observed to . date, and it seems very likely that the impact of this flare on the . planet drove the evaporation seen a few hours later with Hubble.' X-rays . are energetic enough to heat the gas in the upper atmosphere to tens of . thousands of degrees, hot enough to escape the gravitational pull of . the giant planet. A similar . process occurs, albeit less dramatically, when a space weather event . such as a solar flare hits the Earth's ionosphere, disrupting . communications. While the . team believes that the flash of X-rays is the most likely cause of the . atmospheric changes they saw on HD 189733b, there are other possible . explanations. For example, . it may be that the baseline level of X-ray emission from the star . increased between 2010 and 2011, in a seasonal process similar to the . Sun's 11-year sunspot cycle. Regardless . of the details of exactly what happened to HD 189733b's atmosphere, . which the team hope to clarify using future observations with Hubble and . ESA's XMM-Newton X-ray space telescope, there is no question that the . planet was hit by a stellar flare, and no question that the rate of . evaporation of the planet's atmosphere shot up. This . research has relevance not only for the study of Jupiter-like planets. Several recent discoveries of rocky 'super Earths' near their parent . stars are thought to be the remnants of planets like HD 189733b, after . the complete evaporation of their atmospheres.","Huge X-Ray flare 'blasts' atmosphere off into space at 300,000mph .

"By . Leesa Smith . A world-first study will use Facebook as an early intervention tool to help prevent people with Bipolar from lapsing into manic episodes. The Facebook use in Affective Disorders study will analyse the changes in social media use by an individual before and during a bipolar relapse. If the first part of the trial proves that the Facebook monitoring helps to avert people from experiencing relapses then an application will be designed for users to download. People with bipolar can sign up to be part of a trial that monitors their behaviour patterns on Facebook to help prevent relapses . Users will have the option of an alert being sent to them, their doctor, a family member or friend if their social media pattern starts to suggest a possible relapse could occur. The Monash Alfred Psychiatry Research Centre (MAPrc) and School of Intelligent Systems at RMIT is being launched today by beyondblue chairman Jeff Kennett. MAPrc Professor Paul Fitzgerald said the idea for the trail came about when patients were observed to have a change in social media patterns around the time of deterioration in their condition. People with Bipolar disorder who use social media can show signs of their condition deteriorating when their posts and interaction become 'excessively social' . The excessive behaviour is often a telltale sign that the person could be entering a manic stage . ‘People with Bipolar disorder, particularly when they become manic, tend to become excessively socially engaged – the nature of the illness itself is very social, so that is a reason why we think Facebook usage is likely to increase above and beyond other forms of usage,’ he told the MailOnline. This information will becollected to see if it is possible to predict an episode of mania by analysing changes in Facebook use. Data on previous relapse episodes will be collected and compared to current data in order to have an accurate image of how Facebook use varies during a relapse episode. This information is collected to see if there is a link between how the person uses Facebook and their mood at the time of use.

Layton Benton, the 22-year-old star of movies such as 'The Bomb Booty', said today that her account containing thousands of dollars was closed on April 11 and she only found out when her ATM card was declined. Chase reportedly told her she was a 'risk' and wouldn't further elaborate. JP Morgan Chase, the parent company of Chase bank, reportedly ordered the closure of hundreds of bank accounts registered to the names of people who work in adult entertainment industry this month. Porn star Layton Benton plans to sue  Chase bank after she found out her account had been closed allegedly due to her career in adult entertainment . No explanation: Letters were reportedly sent out to people who work across the adult industry. However it does not given any real reason as to why their accounts were being closed . Benton, who lives in LA, told the New York Post: 'I had a few thousand dollars in there, and they told me I’d have to wait ten days to get a check. I literally went to the bank and cried, saying ''You can’t just take someone’s money.''' She said that she was taking legal action and was worried about what closing her account would do to her credit history. She never informed Chase bank of her line of work. MailOnline was awaiting a comment from JP Morgan Chase. Chase . Bank began sending out . letters earlier this month to the entertainers, according to CNBC, informing them their accounts will cease to exist on May 11. The . letter, which has been posted on social media by several of the . industry names involved, says the shut down was a result of a 'review' and apologizes for any inconvenience, however gives no further . explanation. Pornographic actress Teagan Presley, who has a masturbatory device modeled from her body, told adult industry blog XBiz News that a Chase employee said the reason for the termination was because she was in the 'adult business'. Presley said Chase also intend to close her husband's account, and that they were told it would not be possible to open another with the bank. 'This is personal': Porn star Teagan Presley said she was told by Chase her account was closed because of her profession . The letter reiterates that the terms and conditions of a Chase account state that 'either of us may close your account at any time, without notice and without a reason'. Presley, 28, later posted on Twitter: 'Thank you for @Chase for closing my personal account that I’ve had since I was 18 years old. I was with Washington Mutual before you bought them out. 'It's just ridiculous cause I don't do business with that account. I only pay my house bills with it. That's why it's personal.' The move has come as a surprise, given the adult entertainment industry generated close to $5 billion in revenue last year in the United States, according to Economy Watch. There is speculation the Department of Justice triggered the clampdown as part of a targeted effort to shut down certain industries by preventing them access to banking services, which they have called Operation Choke Point. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed last . Thursday, American Banking Association CEO Frank Keating wrote that the . Justice Department is 'telling bankers to behave like policemen and . judges'. 'Operation . Choke Point is asking banks to identify customers who may be breaking . the law or simply doing something government officials don’t like,' Keating wrote. 'Banks must then ''choke off'' those customers’ access to financial services, shutting down their accounts.' Among the others to be caught up in the snafu is up-and-coming porn star Dakota Skye, who Tweeted her frustration. '#Chase has f***** with people before with other issues. Should not get away with s*** like this,' she posted. Tegan . Avluv said her account was being foreclosed as well, calling the move . discrimination because the work that she does is legal.

"By . Simon Jones . Swansea are to re-open talks over a deal for free agent striker Bafetimbi Gomis. The France international is due to travel to Wales on Monday for talks as he considers a move to the Premier League. Gomis has interest from Newcastle but is only considered a back-up option there while QPR have also considered the 27-year-old. On the move: Gomis is interested in joining a Premier League club after his Lyon contract came to an end . Deadly: The French striker scored 17 times last season and could demand around £70,000-a-week at Swansea . Swansea bid £8m for Gomis last year while he was still at Lyon and he is keen to talk to them about their plans. Although he is looking for wages in the region of £75,000 a week, Gomis is still regarded as good value due to his free agent status. Swansea need a new striker with interest mounting in Wilfried Bony and midfielder Michu. Wanted: Bony (left) is in demand after an excellent first season while Napoli and Stoke are looking at Michu . Napoli are among the clubs showing interest in Spaniard Michu but Premier League clubs such as Stoke City are also keen.

"By . Liz Hull . A supermarket cashier who smacked a toddler for misbehaving in her store has been sacked, it emerged last night. The Morrisons employee left four-year-old Max Johnson inconsolable after she slapped the back of his legs. His mother Selina, 26, had nipped into her local supermarket near Chorley, Lancashire, and was paying at the till when Max started acting up. Outraged: Selina Johnson, with her son Max, aged four, who was slapped on the legs by an unnamed Morrisons employee who has now been fired . She reprimanded him for throwing a plastic carrier bag on the floor, but when he refused to pick it up the older female cashier warned him that she would slap his legs if he did not do as he was told. To Miss Johnson’s horror, the unnamed worker, in her 50s, got up from her seat and carried out her threat. Police were called and questioned the woman, but she escaped any formal action after apologising. She was suspended by bosses but yesterday Morrisons confirmed she was ‘no longer an employee’ following a disciplinary hearing. Miss Johnson said after the incident earlier this month: ‘I was totally shocked. Accusation: The post by Selina Johnson which was circulated locally on Facebook . ‘I never thought she would really do it.

We will not tolerate unsporting behaviour.’ The investigation was ongoing on Wednesday night, but video evidence appeared to be damning. The independent disciplinary panel, chaired by Swiss lawyer Claudio Sulser, had a range of sanctions available up to a 24-match ban or a two-year suspension from all football. A worldwide ban would impact on his career at Liverpool, but there is no precedent for such a sanction. It is unclear whether Suarez’s previous bans — 10 games for biting Chelsea’s Branislav Ivanovic and seven matches for biting PSV Eindhoven’s Otman Bakkal — would be taken into consideration, but the panel do have that power.

"By . Tamara Cohen . Updated: . 04:54 EST, 19 October 2011 . Scientists in Britain face being barred from developing life-saving treatments after a court ruled it is ‘immoral’ to use embryos to produce stem cells. The European Court of Justice has decreed that patenting any treatment using the cells is ‘commercial exploitation’ and ‘contrary to morality’. Scientists warned the ‘devastating decision’ will stop pioneering treatments for degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s being developed in the UK, with potentially catastrophic consequences for the multi-million pound biotechnology industry. The decision follows a case brought by Greenpeace in Germany against Professor Oliver Brüstle (pictured) at the University of Bonn. He filed a patent with the German government in 1997 to convert embryonic stem cells into nerve cells to help patients with Parkinson's disease . They believe cutting edge research – . and the huge investment behind it - could move to other countries such . as the United States and China. But pro-life groups, who argue it is immoral to experiment with embryos to advance medicine, welcomed the ruling. The decision, made unanimously by 13 . judges in Luxembourg, follows a case brought by Greenpeace in Germany . against Professor Oliver Brüstle at the University of Bonn. Professor Brüstle filed a patent with . the German government in 1997 to convert embryonic stem cells into . nerve cells to help patients with Parkinson’s disease. Greenpeace challenged it and the case went to the highest court in Germany and then Luxembourg. The resulting 10-page judgement . prohibits patenting any process which involves removing a stem cell from . and then destroying a ‘human embryo’ – defined as anything ‘capable of . commencing the process of development of a human being.’ It states: ‘Patents may not be . granted for inventions whose commercial exploitation would be contrary . to morality... In particular patents shall not be awarded for uses of . human embryos for industrial or commercial purpose.’ The court has ruled that patenting these processes would contradict the European law which protects human life, including embryos, on the grounds that it forms 'commercialisation' of human parts . The court has ruled that patenting . these processes would contradict the European law which protects human . life, including embryos, on the grounds that it forms . ‘commercialisation’ of human parts. However, scientists say stem cells . taken from embryos in their early stages are crucial in developing . life-saving treatments because they can turn into any cell type found in . the body and so can be used to repair diseased and defective tissue. ‘I have just won an international prize from the New York Stem Cell Foundation for translating stem cell research into clinical practice, yet I find now that Europe, the continent in which I am doing this research, is basically calling me immoral’ PROF PETER COFFEY, UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON .

She added: ‘We are a long way from a . declaration on the inviolability of the human embryo but this is . certainly a magnificent judgment in the right direction, and at the very . least gives some added protection and respect to human life at its . earliest stage. ‘It is to be hoped that this will . turn the attention of scientists once and for all away from the human . embryo to concentrate on the innumerable ethically sourced neonatal and . adult stem cell therapies which are already available.

"By . Mike Dawes . All smiles: Ben Crane is hoping to turn an overnight lead into victory . Ben Crane faces a long Sunday on the golf course as he attempts to convert an overnight lead into victory at the FedEx St Jude Classic. The 38-year-old, seeking a fifth win on the PGA Tour and first since 2011, carries a four-shot cushion into the final day of the tournament in Memphis. However he could only play six holes of his third round before darkness descended at TPC Southwind. He improved his score by one shot to 13 under par during his short time on the course, making birdie at the first hole and following up with five pars. In a tournament disrupted by rain breaks, fellow American Troy Merritt played his second round on Saturday and added a four-under 66 to his opening 67. Merritt then picked up two birdies in the first seven holes of his third round to reach nine under for the week, making him the nearest challenger to Crane. A third American, Peter Malnati, occupied third place on eight under following a second round of 68 and an early birdie in his third 18 holes, in which he reached the seventh hole by the end of play. Lurking just one shot further back are a trio of players who will like their chances heading into the business end of the tournament, with South African Retief Goosen joined on seven under by American Billy Horschel and Colombian Camilo Villegas. Play begins at 7am local time on Sunday. Lead: Ben Crane hits from off the second fairway during the third round of the FedEx St Jude Classic . Crane is not intimidated by the prospect of a marathon day on the fairways, saying late on Saturday night: 'I'm excited. What an opportunity I have. Certainly at the beginning of the week I never thought I would have been here so I'll just try to go home, relax, get some food in me and sleep as fast as I can because we got to come back out at 7am and restart. 'I'll just Skype my wife and kids in Dallas, talk to them and read some scripture, try to stay at peace, get a good night's sleep and come out tomorrow and have fun and enjoy the moment.' Sweden's Carl Pettersson leads the European challenge on six under after a pair of 67s and a level-par run through the first seven holes of his third round. He features ahead of a five-strong group that includes England's Paul Casey and American Phil Mickelson, who next week will be targeting a first US Open title to complete a career grand slam. With rain and thunderstorms expected in the area on Sunday, Mickelson would not mind if this week's tournament runs into a fifth day. 'I think the best way to get ready for next week's US Open is to get in contention, have an opportunity and (if) that goes into Monday, so be it,' he said. 'Having the tournament go to Monday, even Tuesday is not detrimental in anyway I don't think.'","Crane hoping to convert overnight lead into victory at FedEx St Jude Classic.

"By . Adam Lee Potter . The days of squinting at a map or the screen of your smartphone when you’re lost will soon be over – thanks to new shoes that tell you which way to turn. The shoes use a Bluetooth link to communicate with your mobile’s mapping system. The mobile works out which route you should be following and the shoes then emit a discreet vibration in either foot telling you when and where to change direction. End of the SatNav? The team at Lechal, which is based in India, designed the shoe so that it connects to the owner's smartphone via Bluetooth . Best foot forward: Using a similar concept, two engineers have created a $100 (£60) smart trainer that guides its wearer by vibration. The team at Lechal, which is based in India, designed the shoe so that it connects to the owner's smartphone via Bluetooth to work out their location and destination . The shoes will also count the number of steps you’ve taken and the calories you’ve burned – and they’ll even buzz to warn you you’ve left your phone behind, or to alert you when you’re travelling past an interesting landmark. The ‘footnav’ technology, called Lechal, comes either ready-fitted in a Ferrari-red shoe or as an insole that can be slipped into any shoe. Both cost $100. 'They are as easy to use as a tap on . the shoulder,’ said Krispian Lawrence, 30, who developed the shoes with . partner Anirudh Sharma, 28, in Hyderabad, India. ‘It’s . that intuitive – if someone taps you on the left shoulder, you . immediately turn left. This product harnesses that basic instinct. ‘You . can even communicate with them using hand gestures and finger snaps . because the shoes have sensors that can pick up movement and sound. 'You can also tell them how many calories you want to burn and they’ll plot the perfect run or cycle.’ Good vibrations: The shoes and insoles connect to the owner's smartphone via Bluetooth to work out their location and destination. That means the shoe will let the owner know when they have to turn left or right by vibrating in either the left or right shoe . The Lechal shoes go on sale worldwide in June but Lawrence and Sharma’s company, Ducere Technologies, has already taken more than 3,000 pre-orders. Lawrence believes the shoes will also improve road safety. ‘If I’m on my bike or motorbike, I don’t want to stare at my phone – it’s dangerous,’ he says. ‘I’d rather be guided by my footwear.’ He believes his innovation will prove invaluable for the visually impaired and has pledged that every mainstream pair sold by Ducere will subsidise a cheaper pair for a visually impaired person. Footnav technology does not impress explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes, however. ‘What’s wrong with a good old-fashioned map?’ said the 70-year-old when told of the shoes. ‘If you rely too heavily on technology you’re heading for trouble. 'Too many people have forgotten – or never learned – the basics: how to read a map and a compass.’ Just say no: Television presenter Hannah White is not a fan of the new shoes believing that they kill off skills like map-reading . TV presenter and adventurer Hannah White is also sceptical. White, a patron of the British Exploring Society and host of Channel 5’s Go Hard Or Go Home, said: . ‘The art of map-reading is dying out – killed off by inventions like this – and that’s tragic. ‘The global positioning system works best when it teaches you the way so you don’t have to use it  the next time. 'With satnav in your shoes, you’ll never have to look even at an on-screen map so you’ll never learn. That’s going backwards, not forwards.’","New trainer uses Bluetooth technology to guide runner around course .

"By . James  Nye . It is what everyone who stands out on The Willis Tower's iconic Skydeck Ledge fears the most. And on Wednesday night it almost came to pass when a family visiting the Chicago skyscraper suffered the scare of their lives when the glass floor of the tourist attraction 1,353-feet up cracked as they sat down for a picture. The astonishing incident caused staff to hurriedly evacuate them as the distinct sound of shattering glass could be heard creeping across the glass enclosure that juts out from the 103rd floor of the building. Scroll Down for Video . Glaziers from MTH Industries finish replacing a layer of protective coating over the glass surface cracked on the 103rd floor of the Willis Tower in Chicago on Thursday . Terrifying: One of the four boxes of The Ledge, the 103rd floor tourist attraction atop Chicago's Willis Tower, appeared to show cracks Wednesday night, but a building official said what was damaged was a protective layer on the glass and that there was no danger to visitors . About to crack: Alejandro Garibay (center left), his brother Ernesto (center right), and two cousins (also pictured) in the glass enclosure just seconds before they heard the sound of shattering glass . 'I had my palms on the floor and I could feel it cracking,' said Alejandro Garibay, who was posing for pictures at the time with his brother and two cousins. 'Honestly, I was in shock, in disbelief.  I was scared.' 'We were watching the fireworks at Navy Pier,' Garibay said to The Chicago Tribune. 'It was an awesome view.  We were getting up and walking away and for some reason I thought it would be cool to get a picture of my cousins and brother. . .Then we started getting off and, as we push ourselves off, I could feel it cracking.  It was completely shattering. 'I thought there was only cracked glass between us and 103 floors down,' he said. 'One of the craziest feelings I had in my life,' added his cousin, Antonio Saldana.  'I thought I was going to fall through.' Ironically, moments before they . stepped into the glass viewing platform just before 10pm, the Garibay family said they were told by . staff the floor, which can withstand up to 5-tons, was unbreakable. 'I was like, wow, I literally can't believe I could have fallen just through it,' said Alejandro to NBC Chicago, who was visiting the 1,451-foot skyscraper - the world's eighth tallest - with family from California. 'At first I see the glass from the ledge to the building crack and at that point I just hopped off.' 'I can' remember if I crawled off or I jumped off. Just a million things, I couldn't believe what was happening,' said Ernesto Garibay about his family's terrifying experience on Wednesday night. 'Even now I can't believe it, it's hard to believe.' 'Especially when they said it's unbreakable.' The see-through glass bays known as The Ledge were designed with a protective coating that cracked on Thursday and glaziers are now working to replace . The attraction is scheduled to reopen on Friday after Glaziers from MTH Industries complete placing a layer of protective coating over the glass surface that cracked on Thursday . Aftermath: Technicians tend to the shattered protective coating that covers the floor of one of four boxes that make up The Ledge 1,353-feet up the Willis Tower in Chicago . Do not look down! Brave tourists step out onto The Ledge which juts out 1,353ft above the sidewalks of Chicago . The Garibay family were among the last customers on Wednesday night - paying $19 for dizzying views of downtown Chicago and Lake Michigan which can stretch for 50 miles on a clear day. Stepping out onto the clear ledge, Alejandro Garibay said that his brother and two cousins began to hear the distinctive and in this situation, terrifying sound of cracking glass. 'All of us collectively start getting up, and it’s at that point that we hear and feel the glass start shattering. Mind you, this is happening in an instant. Incredibly fast,' said Alejandro's cousin, Tony Saldano to CBS News . 'We see it completely just shatter all the way through, and at that point, all four of us just completely rushed right out of it.' Instinctively jumping off the platform, the Garibay's quickly alerted the staff. 'I walked them over so they could see and they were totally shocked and asked us to step away and then proceeded to start calling staff and techs and I don't know who else. When we pulled our phones to start recording and take pictures they asked us to leave right away,' he said. Indeed, in video recorded by Alejandro, the ominous slow creaking noise of breaking glass can be heard. On Thursday morning, all four boxes of the tourist attraction were closed for what a spokesman called a routine inspection. 'Skydeck Chicago is open today while the protective coating is being replaced,' said Brian Rehme, a spokesman for public relations firm FleishmanHillard. 'We have temporarily closed the four Ledge boxes for routine inspection we hope to reopen them shortly.' Not for the faint hearted: Visitors are protected from the 103-storey drop by three inches of glass . Spectacular: The boxes that jut out from the Willis Tower provide never-before-seen views of the city, and allows spectators to see for 50 miles around . America's second tallest: The Willis Tower, formerly the Sears Tower, is the world's 8th tallest building. The four viewing boxes can be seen on the third windows down from the top on the left of the skyscraper . Rehme added that the visitors were never in any danger. 'This coating does not affect the structural integrity of The Ledge in any way. Occasionally, the coating will crack, as it is designed to in order to protect the surface of the glass,' Rehme said in a statement. Skydeck general manager Randy Stancik said the Ledge is safe but should give off 'the illusion that it’s not safe.''We hid the railings, we hid the structural steel — we want to give the illusion that it’s a little bit, ‘Can I take these two steps out of the building?’'he told the Chicago Tribune. A . spokesman for the Willis Tower said that what cracked was a protective . coating on the top of three layers of glass one half-inch thick. 'Occasionally this happens, but that’s because we designed it this way,' said Bill Utter to The Chicago Sun Times. 'Whatever happened last night is a result of the protective coating doing what it’s designed to.' Utter added that this is not the first time the protective coating has cracked. Usually it is caused by a visitor having something sharp in their pocket that scratches or cracks the coating. Workers with MPH peeled the cracked layer of coating on Thursday and put in new glass and caulk. The attraction will reopen Friday morning after city inspectors check to 'make sure all repairs have been completed according to city code,' spokeswoman Mimi Simon told the Chicago Tribune. Opened to great fanfare in 2009, The Ledge is comprised of four glass boxes that are suspended more than 1,300-feet above the ground. They extend four feet out from the Windy . City's most iconic structure and with transparent walls, floors and . ceilings, provide tourists with the feeling of being suspended on air . for those brave enough to peer down. EdgeWalk CN Tower: Canada . Situated in the CN Tower's restaurant in Toronto - part of the experience is a glass floor, 1,122 feet above the ground level. The glass is 2.5 inches thick and is strong enough to hold 14 hippos. Step into the Void: France . Billed as the tallest attraction in Europe at 3280 feet, the structure was three years in the making. It includes five transparent sides made of three layers of tempered glass fixed with metal to a big support structure. Grand Canyon Skywalk: USA . The horsehoe shaped glass-bottomed viewing platform juts 70 feet beyond the Grand Canyons edge, 4,000 feet above the floor. It can accommodate up to 120 guests at a time and offer a bone-chilling vantage point more than twice as high as the world’s tallest buildings. TILT on the 94th floor of the John Hancock Tower: USA . TILT is housed in 360 CHICAGO on the 94th floor of the John Hancock Tower and, as the name suggests, the enclosed glass and steel platform tilts visitors forward for a unique perspective of the city 1000 feet up.
