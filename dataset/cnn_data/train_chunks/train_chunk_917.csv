"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Google has committed to removing a satellite image from its maps that shows the body of a 14-year-old who was murdered in Richmond, California in 2009. The boy's father Jose Barrera learned of the image earlier this week and asked that the web giant remove the shot. In a statement to MailOnline a Google spokesperson said the company has decided to make an exception to its usual procedure and replace the image as soon as possible. Grisly reminder: The body of 14-year-old Kevin Barrera can be seen on this Google Earth image. His body, which has been blurred by MailOnline, is at the bottom of the image as officers gather above . 'Our hearts go out to the family of this young boy. Since the media first contacted us about the image, we’ve been looking at different technical solutions,' read the statement. 'Google has never accelerated the replacement of updated satellite imagery from our maps before, but given the circumstances we wanted to make an exception in this case.' Technology analyst Rob Enderle told KTVU he believed it was unlikely Google would pull the image. 'When they remove it for one person for one thing, then how do they not do it for others?' he asked. 'And so they've found it easier just to say no.' Jose Barrera said the picture on Google Earth shows his son Kevin, who was found battered and shot to death beside train tracks in Richmond, California four years ago. Distraught: Jose Barrera is pleading with Google to remove the image, saying it brings back terrible memories . Victim: His son Kevin was beaten and shot to death. No one has been arrested for the killing . 'When I see this image, that's still like . that happened yesterday,' the distraught father told KTVU. 'And that brings me back to a . lot of memories.' Google technicians estimate they can have the image updated in eight days. 'We’ve spoken to the family to let them know we’re working hard on the update,' concluded the statement. Kevin Barrera was found shot dead just off the railroad tracks in August 2009 - in the area which was known for trouble. Six people were killed there between February and October of that year. The teenager, who was known to police, had spent the evening of August 14 with his family but left alone on foot after getting some phone calls. His body was found at 7am the next morning by a passerby. No arrests have been made in his death. 'I don't know the right words to say how I feel,"" his father told the Contra Costa Times after the murder. 'My heart is really broke.' Scene: His body was found on August 15, 2009 in a notoriously troubled area of Richmond, California . His stepmother, Leticia Marquez, told a crowd after the death: 'All you kids who are Kevin's age, please help us. Please help your brothers and sisters, because they are looking for kids your age. They are taking our kids. This age is the right time for bad people to take our sons from us.' His death was the 33rd homicide victim in Richmond in 2009. By the end of the year, 47 people had been killed there, placing it as the second deadliest city after New Orleans.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . The first planets outside the solar system were confirmed in 1992, uninhabitable worlds around a pulsar 1,000 light years away. Over the next 17 years the discoveries of more and more planets started to trickle in. But in 2009, with the launch of Nasa’s Kepler telescope, the number of confirmed planets shot up from several hundred to over a thousand – and with it our chances of finding a new Earth have dramatically increased. This Nasa graphic shows how the number of confirmed planets has dramatically increased since the launch of Kepler in 2009 and its subsequent studies of distant stars . To date Kepler has found 3,845 planetary candidates, 962 of which have been confirmed as planets. It was not until last week, however, that astronomers finally found a world they had been trying to find for so long. Just last week, MailOnline reported that a planet the size of Earth had finally been found orbiting in the so-called habitable zone of a star – the holy grail of planet hunting. As shown in the graphics on this page, the remarkable amount of planets that are known of is thanks to the Kepler telescope. It was announced last week that the first Earth-sized planet in a habitable zone of a distant star had been found. With the discovery of this planet, called Kepler-186f, astronomers are now closer than ever to finding a true Earth 2.0. ‘There could be many of these planets closer by,’ Nasa Kepler scientist Dr Steve Howell told MailOnline. ‘If we can find those and subject them to study, we could see if they have biosignatures in the atmosphere. ‘In the next 20 years I’d say there’s an 80 per cent chance we’ll find a definite habitable planet in our vicinity. ‘If we look at all those planets we won’t see cities or coastlines or green fields, but I think we’ll have a good shot of seeing water vapour and things that make us believe they’re more like Earth.’ It found planets by observing 100,000 stars simultaneously and measuring dips in light if a planet passed in front. Known as the transit method, this has proved wildly successful and revealed a host of planets. For a planet to be confirmed, however, three transits must be observed. This has meant that most of the planets discovered so far are on much tighter orbits than Earth as they complete transits more quickly. These worlds are inhospitable to life as we know it, but their discoveries has given us a glimpse into the broad range of planets in the universe. For planets more akin to Earth, that are in more habitable orbits, it takes longer to observe three transits. This is why it has taken until now to confirm planets the size of Earth in habitable zones, as these planets could not be confirmed until the third transit had been confirmed. As data of repeated transits is studied, more planets in more 'habitable' orbits will be found. The Kepler space telescope finds planets using the transit method, which measures the dip in light from stars when a planet passes in front, from which the world's size and orbit can be deduced . Kepler has found many siginificant planet including Kepler 296-f (pictured), a so-called 'super Earth' twice the size of our planet but in the habitable zone of its star, meaning it could have liquid water on its surface . The Kepler telescope is currently ‘dead in the water’ as it has now lost functionality in two of its four reaction wheels. These were used to point the telescope accurately at distant stars. However, a bold new plan to save the telescope known as the K2 mission is currently in the works, Nasa’s Steve Howell tells MailOnline. ‘As of May of 2013, Kepler lost its second reaction wheel and that left it with only two,’ he says. ‘The way you point the spacecraft very tightly is using reaction wheels in a 3-axis system. ‘Once you have only two in particular, most people believe your spacecraft can’t be used to point precisely.’ ‘So working with engineers at Bell Aerospace we devised this unique plan where we would point the telescope in its orbital plane. ‘Laying flat in that direction, we use the Sun’s light shining on the solar panels to provide a balancing force like a third reaction wheel.’ Nasa's Kepler space telescope, pictured, has been the most successful planet-hunting observatory to date . The discovery of Kepler-186f, artist's rendering pictured, was announced last week. It is the first Earth-sized planet found in the habitable zone of a star, and could signal that there are Earth 2.0s waiting to be found in Kepler's data . The team have spent the fall trying the new mission proposal out and the spring testing the data acquisition. Now they know that it works ‘incredibly well’ and they have given their proposal to repurpose the telescope to Nasa. They are hoping for funding to continue operating the mission for the next two or three years. Via this method they will be limited to planets in orbits of 40 days or so. But they will be observing planets in orbits around stars different to those that were observed in the initial mission. Namely, the stars will be more like our own sun than those in the original ‘Kepler field,’ which was mainly stars dimmer than our sun known as M-type stars such as red dwarfs. This new mission will give astronomers further information on how common planets are around stars like our sun. And ultimately, considering the huge numbers of planets found by the observatory so far, it could be yet another feather in the cap of this famous planet hunting telescope.","Nasa's planet-hunting Kepler space telescope was launched in 2009 .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . For decades astronomers have been searching for a world like our own outside the solar system that could host alien life. And now they have announced that they have found one - a planet 1.1 times the size of Earth orbiting a star just 490 light years away. Called Kepler-186f, the planet is the first to be discovered with the right conditions for liquid water to exist on its surface, meaning it could support alien life as well. Scroll down for video . Last week, astronomers said they had discovered a planet called Kepler-186f, artist's impression pictured. Kepler-186f is special because it marks the first planet almost exactly the same size as Earth orbiting in the 'habitable zone' The find was made by a team of astronomers led by Elisa Quintana of the SETI Institute at Nasa Ames Research Center, who pored through planetary data from Nasa’s Kepler space telescope. To date, the telescope has found hundreds of planets, but most are uninhabitable worlds that are either too large or orbit too close to their host star to support life. The discovery of Kepler-186f, therefore, is a big milestone in the field of planet hunting. It is the fifth and outermost world of the planetary system around red dwarf star Kepler-186 and is almost certainly a rocky planet. The find is significant because it is the first Earth-sized world we’ve found in the habitable zone of a star. Habitable zones, also known as ‘Goldilocks zones’, are regions around a star where the temperature is just right for water to form. Earth, for example, sits almost bang in the middle of our sun’s habitable zone. Although previously we have found exoplanets (worlds outside the solar system) in these zones, none have been the same size as Earth. As our planet is known to have life, it stands to reason that a similar planet may also be habitable. This could make Kepler-186f the first world we’ve found that might host life as we know it. The Goldilocks zone, or habitable zone, is the belt around a star where temperatures are ideal . for liquid water to . pool on a planet's surface. To determine the location of a star's habitable zone, scientists have to first learn how much total radiation it emits. They can calculate this by knowing the size and type of the star. They can then estimate a region where it might not be too hot or too cold for water to form. The diagram compares the planets of our inner solar system to Kepler-186, a five-planet system about 490 light-years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus. The five planets of Kepler-186 orbit a star classified as a M1 dwarf, measuring half the size and mass of the sun . ‘Taking our planet as an example, water is pretty important for life,’ Dr Steve Howell, one of the lead authors on the study that found Kepler-186f and a scientist on the Kepler mission, tells MailOnline. This makes the discovery of a planet that could have water all the more important. 'Kepler 186f will likely provide our first opportunity to search for alien life beyond the solar system.' The planet orbits an M-type dwarf star, one that is slightly dimmer than our own sun, making its habitable zone hug it slightly tighter. But Kepler-186f is on a slightly different orbit than Earth, taking 130 days to make it around the star. This places it towards the edge of the habitable zone of Kepler-186. The other four planets in the system have orbits lasting three to 21 days, making them inhospitable. The Kepler space observatory, named . after the 17th century German astronomer Johannes Kepler, was launched . on 7 March 2009 to scan a portion of the Milky Way for Earth-size . planets that could harbour life. The research team use data from . Nasa's Kepler space telescope, which simultaneously and continuously . measured the brightness of more than 150,000 stars every 30 minutes. When . a planet candidate transits, or passes, in front of the star from the . spacecraft's vantage point, a percentage of light from the star is . blocked. This causes a dip in the brightness of the starlight that reveals the transiting planet's size relative to its star. Once three transits have been observed, a planet can be confirmed to exist around the star. To measure the planet's size accurately, the size of the star must be known. ‘Kepler-186f is at the right distance from the star for water to form,’ Thomas Barclay, a research scientist on the Kepler mission and another author on the paper announcing the discovery of the planet, tells MailOnline. Barclay was involved in modelling the planet and discerning what we think it could look like, as shown in the artist’s impressions. ‘We looked at the kind of light coming from the star, which is slightly redder than our sun,’ he explains. ‘So we tried to cover the planet in the right colour light, so the planet looks slightly more orangey. ‘We tried to work out what sort of colour the ocean would be, so with less blue light the oceans would be duller, not a bright blue like our own planet. ‘Then we have the clouds and ice, which are very reasonable assumptions to exist if there’s an atmosphere. ‘These would reflect the same colour as the star – our clouds are white because the sun is white. ‘So on Kepler-186f they would appear orangey and red.' This image of Kepler-186f based on what the astronomers expect it might look like. Plant life is yellow due to the manner in which it reflects light from the star but the water and clouds would probably be more orange . While it’s known the planet is in the habitable zone, astronomers can’t be sure with absolute certainty it has water. Extrapolating on what we know from Earth, however, Kepler-186f is a prime candidate for being a world with oceans and seas. That would be dependent on it having an atmosphere, though. ‘If we didn’t have an atmosphere, we wouldn’t have liquid water,’ says Barclay. ‘It blankets us and traps heat. The Kepler space telescope orbits the Sun 40 million miles (65 million kilometres) from Earth. It is named after 17th Century astronomer Johannes Kepler. It was launched in 2009 with the sole purpose of finding new stars and planets. To date hundreds of planets have been confirmed with the telescope. But there is still a lot of data to look through which could have more planets within it. The telescope recently lost the functionality in two of its four 'reaction wheels' that are used to point it at stars. This has left it lying adrift in space, but Nasa has plans to re-purpose it for a new mission. ‘The same would happen on Kepler-186f.’ And if there is plant life on this planet, Barclay says it would again be different to what we have on Earth. ‘We did think about what colour the plant life might be due to photosynthesis. ‘The best guess is they would be more yellow, due to the different colour of the star. ‘The plants would be yellow because it’s to do with the energy coming in and being reflected.’ Both Barclay and Howell say that this world is probably more like a cousin to Earth than a direct twin. It has similar characteristics but it orbits a different star. With upcoming telescopes like Nasa’s James Webb Space Telescope, launching in 2018, we might be able to observe the atmospheres of planets like these closer to us and find out if they have similar chemical compositions to our own. This would definitively give us answers as to how habitable other worlds are. 70 per cent of all stars are so-called M-type stars, the same as the one Kepler-186f orbits. This means that a lot of planets we find might also be in orbit around these stars. Discovering that Earth-sized worlds can exist in the habitable zone around these stars, therefore, is of huge importance. ‘There could be many of these planets closer by,’ explains Dr Howell. ‘If we can find those and subject them to study, we could see if they have biosignatures in the atmosphere. ‘In the next 20 years I’d say there’s an 80 per cent chance we’ll find a definite habitable planet in our vicinity. ‘If we . look at all those planets we won’t see cities or coastlines or green . fields, but I think we’ll have a good shot of seeing water vapour and . things that make us believe they’re more like Earth.’ And there are still many planets lurking in the data collected by the Kepler space telescope. The announcement of Kepler-186f is just a tantalising hint at the number of habitable worlds that could be awaiting our discovery. 'One of the steps along the road to . answering “Are we alone?” is finding worlds such as Kepler-186f that look like the one . planet that we know is inhabited,' Barclay concludes.","The first Earth-sized world in the habitable zone of a star has been found .

"By . Mia De Graaf . They look like they've dropped down from another galaxy. But these mesmerising figures are in fact a bunch of bees, beetles and ants. In a collection of extraordinary close-ups, the insects' microscopic neon patterns that go unnoticed by humans are revealed. Other-worldly: This is a tiger beetle - a species normally known for its fast pace and venemous attack . Different take: Photographer Yudy Sauw, of Tangerang in Indonesia, captured shots of numerous bugs including a jewel frog beetle, an ant, a bee and a mantis . And they aren't shy, obediently holding their glare for ten minutes at a time for the camera. Among the assortment of everyday bugs in Indonesia, a jewel frog beetle, dragonfly, bee and red ant were all photographed to show off their intricate patterns. Their miniscule hairs can be seen in great detail - which normally would be missed as they fly past. Jewel Beetles, also know as Sagra buqueti in South East Asia, are commonly known as Frog Beetles due to the large back legs. Toy-like: The mantis is a regal figure in the insect world - but this unusual image makes the willowy bug looks translucent, as if it is a toy made out of rubber . Character: This red ant looks like a character from a sci-fi film and the glaring sun highlights its features . While bees normally zoom past, Mr Sauw was able to capture one looking still and plump, almost like a manatee . Mesmerising: But close-up the bee looks just as alien-like as the others - with leopard spots on its eyes . Its outer shell is metallic green with a gold line running down its back. Photographer Yudy Sauw from Tangerang, Indonesia, spent ten minutes on each picture of the tiny insects. The flying bee was around 50cm away from Mr Sauw, while the extreme close-ups were taken from just 10cm away. Neon: The obedient insects, which stayed still for ten minutes at a time, are covered in neon patterns that are too small and nuanced for the human eye to detect . Faces: In this bizarre image of a bug eating another, their eyes and stances seem to betray emotion . Mr Sauw had to be calm and patient when taking the photos, to prevent the tiny insects from flying away. He said: 'All of the photographs were taken in my studio in Indonesia. 'You can see a jewel frog beetle, dragonfly, red ant and flying bee. Mr Sauw spent weeks monitoring the insects and positioning himself to capture their glowing detail . Delicate: He had to get as near as 10cm away from his objects for ten minutes without scaring them away . 'The flying bee was the only one moving, and luckily, the other insects managed to stay incredibly still. 'The extreme close-ups were only 10 centimetres away, which allowed me to capture clear macro photographs. 'All of the insects had to be incredibly still for the process to work.'","Images of Indonesian dragonfly, jewel frog beetle, bee, mantis and red ant reveal the intricate patterns and neon colours of their shells .

"By . Katy Winter . Eastern promise: Despite her Scandinavian roots, Anna Soderstom lead the Oxford University Middle Eastern Dance Society . When Monty Python star Terry Jones married Anna Soderstrom last year, only their four-year-old daughter Siri and two neighbours were in attendance at the ceremony in north London. None of his friends, family or children from his first marriage - and none of his famous colleagues from the Monty Python troupe, which has just publicly announced its reunion amid smiles and hugs. Terry revealed this week that the secret wedding took place just months after the finalisation of his divorce from Alison Telfer, his wife of 42 years. Terry claimed he and Alison were in an open marriage when he met Anna at a book signing in Oxford in 2005, where - as a 23-year-old - she was doing a degree in modern languages. But it didn't take long for Jones's marriage to hit the buffers. Apart from the facts that Jones reveals - he told The Sun about the secret wedding, for example, and the fact that the day was not celebrated by fellow Pythons John Cleese, Michael Palin, Eric Idle or Terry Gilliam - very little is known about his young bride. It sounds like the sort of eclectic description that Jones himself would write for one of his sketches. His wife was born in Sweden, studied at Oxford, and enjoys a spot of belly dancing. Famously, Soderstrom was photographed with a belly-dancing troupe at the Jericho Tavern in Oxford a year after the couple met. She was reported to have joined the . Oxford University Middle Eastern Dance Society because Jones likes to role play and wanted to spice up their love life. The . brunette arrived from Stockholm in 2002 . to study modern languages at Oxford's Hertford College, where Terry also . gained his degree before embarking on his comedy career. Jones was doing a book signing when he met Anna in 2005 and the pair began dating. Described . as 'quiet and unassuming', she is, at first glance, not a traditional . siren and was apparently something of a reticent figure at college. Jones was taking part in a book signing when he met Anna, then 23, in 2005 and the pair began dating. They married in secret last year . Terry and Anna Soderstrom with their daughter Siri, who was born in 2009 . One . contemporary told the Daily Mail in 2005: 'If anything, she fancies . herself as something of an intellectual and keeps herself to herself. She is not an obvious sex symbol.’ She . was said to be an 'avid fan' of Monty Python. On hearing that Jones was . to attend a book signing at the Oxford bookshop Blackwells she decided . to go along. According . to one source, she introduced herself to Jones and they enjoyed an . impromptu chat which continued over drinks and dinner. First wife: Jones with Alison Telfer at London's Institut Francaise in 1998. They were married in 1970 and rem,ained married even after Jones fathered Soderstrom's child . Funny friends: Michael Palin and John Cleese with Jones, centre, and Terry Gilliam and Eric Idle at the Monty Python 40th Anniversary in 2009. The reunion shows will start next year . In 1995 Jones, from Colwyn Bay, North . Wales, had revealed he had an open marriage with Biochemist wife Alison . Telfer, claiming they both had lovers without it affecting their . relationship. Telfer was said to be furious over the admission, believing their private life should remain exactly that. When she learned of the affair with . Anna, who is a decade younger than Terry's own daughter - one of two . children he fathered with Alison - she asked Jones to leave the marital . home in Camberwell, south London. He spent Christmas with . Soderstrom in the home they now share in Highgate, north London. The couple have been together ever since. Anna’s . father Torbjorn Soderstrom, 55, a surgeon, supports the relationship. He said: ‘I’ve never been against it in any sort of way. Anna, seen smiling for the camera on a family holiday, came to England in 2002 to study at Oxford . Anna at age 22, a year before she met Terry, who is older than her own father . Anna's difficult pregnancy with Siri encouraged her to start knitting . ‘I’m very fond of Terry. I’ve been a Monty Python fan since I was a kid. I have no opinion on the age difference. Relationships are not about that.’ In 2009, Anna gave birth to the couple’s only child, daughter Siri. While pregnant Anna took up knitting, enjoying it so much that she started a business selling handmade luxury scarfs, blankets and hats. The company, named after Anna, operates out of a north London studio and uses high-quality British wool, as well as alpaca and cashmere. Talking to the Ham And High newspaper about her venture, Anna, who had been working as a script supervisor for Terry before she fell pregnant, said : ‘I was very ill during my pregnancy and had terrible morning sickness. ‘I was debilitated really. I couldn’t even read it was that bad. ‘One day my mother gave me some knitting needles to help pass the time. I discovered I could do it and spent the whole pregnancy knitting. ‘We [she and Terry] were living and working together at that time, which was actually not bad at all – it was a great collaboration. But I always thought I wanted to do something for myself, rather than just play a supporting role for my husband.’ Tickets to the Monty Python reunion show sold out in less than a minute after going on sale on Monday morning. The urviving members of the veteran comedy troupe announced they were getting back together last . week. A spokesman for the . Pythons said the July 1 event at London's O2 Arena sold out in 43.5 . seconds, with tickets for four further shows then immediately going on . sale. The concerts at the venue in Greenwich, south east London, come more than 30 years after their last stage performance. Speaking . at last week's press conference, they said they would include some of . their most famous routines including the dead parrot sketch. Return: The surviving members of the Python comedy group, from left, Palin, Idle, Jones, Gilliam and John Cleese quickly added four more dates . Idle said fans could 'expect a little comedy, a lot of pathos, some music and a tiny bit of ancient sex'. Speaking . on The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Cleese said: 'If we can add some . shows we will but it will entirely depend on if the tickets sell. We . always say that when we get together, we laugh more than at any other . time in our lives so it's kind of fun.' Their last major live show was at the Hollywood Bowl in 1982. Cleese . added: 'We have to be very careful about doing new stuff. It's not a . theatrical presentation, it's like a rock concert and when people go to . rock concerts they want to hear the old songs and they're actually . literally disappointed if you do new material.' We're back: At a press conference last week at the Corinthia Hotel, the group posed with Carol Cleveland . Old material: Cleveland being held up by the Pythons in their heyday - including the late Graham Chapman, who is just peeking out behind the left of Cleveland's hat . The Pythons amassed millions of . fans for their groundbreaking, anarchic comedy series and films, which . also launched their own successful solo careers. Monty . Python's Flying Circus was made for TV between 1969 and 1974 and . generations of fans can recite lines and whole sketches. The team went . on to make films including Monty Python And The Holy Grail (1975) and . Monty Python's Life of Brian (1979). Sixth . Python Graham Chapman died of cancer in 1989 aged just 48, and nine . years later the five remaining members shared a stage at the Aspen . Comedy Festival in the US. They said they would miss performing with Chapman but he would have a presence on-screen during the show. Idle said: 'We've told him we're going on and, if there is a God, he'll be turning up.' The event will be filmed and 'we will try and flog it later', he added.","Terry met Anna Soderstrom, then 23, in 2005 and the pair began dating .

The stunt woman makes good progress on stationary practice runs, signalling that she's ready to attempt the same crossing while the wagons are rolling . With the wind speed battering her, and legs shaking vigorously, she continues her precarious walk between the two wagons. In a dramatic finish  with seconds to spare, she leaps onto the wagon before it speeds through a tunnel. Miss Dickey, who is the world record holder for highlining, said that the stunt was one of the most terrifying she has done. Cautious: As the trucks pull off, Miss Dickey checks everything is in place before she makes her first tentative steps across the rope . Progress: The stunt appears to be going well, with the daredevil holding up well despite the wind battering her and shaking the rope . A brief wobble on the rope and the stunt woman drops to her knees as she struggles to stay upright . Disaster: One wrong foot placement and Miss Dickey slips, only just managing to hold on to the rope to prevent her from dangling upside down by a safety catch on her ankle . Near miss: With her legs in the air, Miss Dickey swings on the cable desperately trying to keep alive her adrenaline-inducing crossing . She added: 'I'm used to heights, long lines and lines that sway in the wind. But those lines are firmly anchored to cliff-faces. 'Walking a line attached to two moving points is something quite different.' Peter Pedrero, who normally works with stunts in films such as James Bond, Harry Potter and Pirates of the Caribbean, worked with Faith to create the stunt. He said: 'And here was I thinking that every imaginable stunt had already been done. The fact is that nobody has ever before walked a line between two moving trucks. Having regained some stability, the balancing expert is able to continue the exploit with the trucks speeding along the unopened motorway in Croatia . The sun shines down on the athlete as she adopts a crouching pose to lower her centre of gravity and keep her balance half way along the rope . Don't look down! A shot from Miss Dickey's helmet camera shows the view she will have had of the road below, which had no traffic on it at the time of the feat . Tension: The experienced truckers are pictures of concentration as they use their own steady hands and feet to keep their vehicles at a consistent speed . 'It felt like an enormous challenge, and it's challenges that get me going. 'Stunts are not for the reckless. Safety always comes first. You have to prepare for the worst possible scenario at all times, and plan for how to deal with it. 'Preparation down to the tiniest detail, meticulous planning - they're absolutely vital.' The feat was recorded in a dramatic video against the orange hue of the sun. Miss Dickey is almost across the wire as the wagons approach a tunnel. If she doesn't make it across she will be killed and if the vehicles begin to slow she will lose her balance and fall anyway . With inches to spare Miss Dickey jumps for her life and makes it to the opposite truck just as it enters the tunnel . Phew: Miss Dickey completes the first ever slackline crossing between two moving vehicles . We made it! Miss Dickey raises her hands in celebration after completing the dramatic stunt . Video Director Henry Alex Rubin said: 'My favorite kind of shoot is when someone tells me something is impossible to film. When I hear no, it makes me want to move mountains. 'Faith Dickey is the same way. Tell her 'no' and it will fuel her. She humbled and amazed myself and the entire crew with her courage. 'This stunt started off as a way to test the precision of Volvos massive 16-wheeled trucks and ended up being just as much a testament to guts and courage.'","Faith Dickey, 23, completes stunt with seconds to spare before tunnel ."
"By . Thomas Burrows for MailOnline . A mixed martial arts fighter called 'War Machine' has been arrested on suspicion of beating his former girlfriend so severely she feared for her life. The 32-year-old fighter, whose real name is Jon Koppenhaver, was captured in the Los Angeles suburb of Simi Valley on Friday, August 15. He was reportedly found sitting in an Extended Stay America hotel room with a pizza and a small amount of cash. He has since been inside Ventura County jail, where he awaits extradition to Nevada. Scroll down for video . Mixed martial arts fighter, 'War Machine', whose real name is Jon Koppenhaver, has been arrested on suspicion of beating his former girlfriend, Christy Mack, so severely she thought she might die . Ms Mack, 23, says that attack left her with 18 broken bones around her eyes, a nose broken in two places, and hair sawed off by a knife . The 32-year-old fighter was captured in the Los Angeles suburb of Simi Valley on Friday, August 15 . The MMA fighter is accused of beating his ex-girlfriend Christy Macky so badly on August 8 that she told police in Las Vegas she thought she might die. Ms Mack, 23, told police that the 'War Machine' showed up unannounced at her house where she and friend, Corey Thomas, were sleeping. She said Koppenhaver began beating Thomas, before sending him away with the threat that he would have friends kill him if he reported the assault. Ms Mack told Las Vegas police that the fighter then turned his attention to her and started attacking her, as he scrolled through her text messages. According to police reports, Koppenhaver punched and kicked Mack and she was treated for extensive facial bruises, fractures, lost teeth and internal injuries, including a lacerated liver. Ms Mack, an adult film actor, said she escaped, naked, out of a back door when the fighter went to the kitchen, where she thought he was fetching a knife. According to police reports, Koppenhaver punched and kicked Mack and she was treated for extensive facial bruises, fractures, lost teeth and internal injuries, including a lacerated liver . She later posted a statement online that she feared for her life when Koppenhaver allegedly sawed off her hair with a dull knife. She wrote: 'About 2 a.m. Friday morning (August 8), Jon Koppenhaver arrived unannounced to my home in Las Vegas, NV, after he broke up with me in May he moved out of my house and back to San Diego. 'When he arrived, he found myself and one other fully clothed and unarmed in the house. Without a single word spoken, he began beating my friend; once he was finished, he sent my friend away and turned his attention to me. 'He made me undress and shower in front of him, then dragged me out and beat my face. I have no recollection of how many times I was hit, I just know my injuries that resulted from my beating. 'My injuries include 18 broken bones around my eyes, my nose is broken in two places, I am missing teeth and several more are broken.' Ms Mack went on to write that she was unable to see from her left eye or chew or speak clearly because of her damaged teeth. She also said she could not walk on her own, and had a fractured rib and ruptured liver from a kick to her side. 'I also attained several lesions from a knife he got from my kitchen,' she wrote. Prosecutors in Las Vegas filed multiple felony, battery, assault and coercion charges against Koppenhaver . 'He pushed the knife into me in some areas such as my hand, ear, and head. He also sawed much of my hair off with this dull knife. 'After some time, the knife broke off of the handle and continued to threaten me with the blade. I believed I was going to die. 'He has beaten me many times before, but never this badly. He took my phone and cancelled all of my plans for the following week to make sure no one would worry about my whereabouts.' Mack also alleged her ex-boyfriend threatened to rape her. 'He told me he was going to rape me, but was disappointed in himself when he could not get hard. 'After another hit or two, he left me on the floor bleeding and shaking, holding my side from the pain of my rib.' Mack writes that she made her escape when Koppenhaver went into her kitchen where she assumed he was searching for a new knife. 'I ran out my back door, shutting it behind me so the dogs didn't run inside to tip him off. I hoped the fence to the golf course behind my house and ran to a neighboring house. 'Naked and afraid he would catch me, I kept running through the neighborhood knocking on doors. Finally one answered and I was brought to the hospital and treated for my injuries.' Mack concluded that she had been living in fear of Koppenhaver for months, and that the pair had an abusive relationship in which she dealt with beatings and infidelity in the past. Mack said in an online statement: 'I have no recollection of how many times I was hit' After she put the graphic images online on August 11, the authorities issued a warrant for Koppenhaver and he became the subject of a manhunt. A hotel guest told KTLA-TV in Los Angeles that she summoned police to the hotel after seeing a large man yelling, pushing and grabbing the hair of a woman who was trying to calm him down. He was eventually captured by police in Simi Valley on August 15. Prosecutors in Las Vegas filed multiple felony, battery, assault and coercion charges against Koppenhaver. If convicted, it could land him in prison for more than 25 years. The welterweight fighter made his Ultimate Fighting Championship debut in 2007. He legally changed his name in 2008. He lost his only pay-per-view bout that same year. He fought out of San Diego for a variety of promotions and had a 14-5 record as a welterweight. He lost his last fight, in Iowa, last October.","Fighter has been arrested on suspicion of beating his former girlfriend, Christy Mack, and her friend .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . From the Empire State Building to the Blue Mosque, plenty of people take photographs of iconic architecture when on holiday. And now Google Maps’ Panoramio ‘heat map’ of the world allows people to see the most photographed travel destinations. Three of the five most photographed places on the planet are in the EU, according to the popular service, which lets people tag photos of landmarks and scenery and upload them to Google maps. Scroll down for interactive map . New York City is the most photographed place in the world. Rome, Barcelona, Paris and Istanbul make up the rest of the top five most photographed destinations, leading one to suppose that the service is more popular than in some areas of the world than others . According to the website’s heat map, New York City is the most photographed place in the world, or at least more images of New York landmarks and scenes have been uploaded via Panoramio than any other city. Rome, Barcelona, Paris and Istanbul make up the rest of the top five most photographed destinations, suggesting the service is more popular in some areas of the world than others. The map shows the most popular photographic locations in yellow, before fading to orange, pink and then purple for slightly less photographed places, making it easy to pick out popular holiday spots, cities and wonders of the world. London was, unsurprisingly, the most snapped location in the UK and Ireland, followed by Dublin, Stonehenge, Brighton and Bath. Rome, Barcelona, Paris, Istanbul and Venice were the five most photographed places in Europe, according to the map. Monte Carlo, Florence, Budapest, Prague and Madrid made up the rest of the top ten . However, Britain’s capital missed out on a spot in Europe’s top five most photographed sights, which comprised: Rome, Barcelona, Paris, Istanbul and Venice. The top five photographed cities or sites in North America are: New York, Niagara Falls, Chicago, San Francisco and Havana, while Buenos Aires is the most snapped in South America, followed by: Sao Paulo, Mexico City, Ipanema – a beach resort south of Rio - and Iguazu Falls. Photos shared via Panoramio can be viewed as a layer on Google Earth and Google Maps and the map was created based on the number of Panoramio photos at each place in the world. The hottest places have markers linking photos, Street View, Wikipedia, Wikivoyage, Foursquare and Google Plus articles about the site. Google Maps' Panoramio 'heatmap' of the world allows people to see the most photographed travel destinations and seven of the top 10 are in the geographical area of Europe, perhaps suggesting that the service is most popular in this continent . The five most photographed sites, according to the 'heatmap' are: Harmandir Sahib, the Red Fort, Jaipur, the Taj Mahal and the site of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks. There are relatively few 'hot' yellow areas in India compared to in Europe, leading one to surmise that the service is not as popular in this part of the world . The service asks users to organise images using geotags, such as Paris, or Eiffel Tower, which enable searchers to find images of a destination or subject matter easily. Users can search the map to highlight top places in a given area, including most photographed 1,000 locations in the world or given country. Shanghai was the most photographed place in Asia, followed by Beijing, Kowloon, Tokyo and Bangkok, while Johannesburg was the most documented in Africa, followed by Ethekwini (which includes Durban), Simon’s Town, Kruger Park and the Knysna Heads – an infamous spot for shipwrecks and part of the ‘Garden route’.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Brewery bosses were left red-faced after some of the lights on their iconic sign were switched off to spell out a rude message just days after the firm announced a string of redundancies. The red neon sign above the Thwaites brewery in Blackburn, has blazed out like a beacon across the Lancashire town for decades. But shortly after the firm announced they would be axing up to 60 jobs, the letters H, I and E mysteriously disappeared, leaving a rather indignant message presumably aimed at bosses. Bitter blow: The iconic Thwaites brewery sign in Blackburn spelled out an altogether different message after the firm announced a series of job cuts . Although it has not been confirmed that the sign change is linked with the job cuts, suspicions are disgruntled employees are to blame. Jobs: The brewery has recently announced up to 60 redundancies at the plant . The first sightings were made at around . 4.40pm on Friday. Within 15 minutes the entire sign was blacked out . before the lights were restored to normal working order. A spokesman for Thwaites said that on being alerted the brewery turned the lights off and launched an investigation into what had happened. He said: 'When made aware of it, all the lights were immediately switched off. 'It's not clear what happened, whether there was a fault or other problem but only a few people have access to that part of the building.' Twitter went into overdrive on the topic last night. One Twitter user Luke Gilrane said: 'Think Thwaites Brewery might have annoyed one of their employees.' Another, Matt Bury said: 'Thwaites Brewery lay off workers in Blackburn. Here's their response for all the world to see.' David Corrigan said: 'I have been awaiting this moment for years. I am overjoyed' Samuel Williams tweeted at Thwaites: 'Your sign's a bit unfortunate at the moment!' And Andy Hicken added: 'A superb employment of knackered bulbs.' Redundancy announcements were made after the firm announced plans to close the majority of its Blackburn brewery. Bosses at the firm said negotiations with the council and supermarket chain Sainsbury's to build on the site had failed. Landmark: The red neon sign on top of the Thwaites brewery has blazed out across the Lancashire town of Blackburn for decades . A spokesperson said: 'The lights at the brewery were affected for a very short time on Friday. 'They are now back to normal but our main concern continues to be for those valued employees who have been affected by our proposed restructure which was announced last week.' The move means large-scale brewing at the town centre site will cease, but Thwaites intends to keep the visitor centre and craft brewery, Crafty Dan, on the current site.","Red neon sign shines out above the Thwaites brewery in Blackburn .

"By . Associated Press . When it comes to women's clothing sizes, there's some funny math going on. The average American woman is about 25 pounds heavier than she was in 1960. Yet women's plus-size clothing, generally defined as size 14 and up, still makes up only about 9per cent of the $190billion spent annually on clothes. What's wrong with this equation? It's not that plus-size women aren't into fashion. Rather, the fashion industry doesn't seem interested in them. The fashion industry has long spent more time, money and marketing on clothing for taut bodies than for curvier ones because it's easier and more profitable to do so. Inspiring: H&M, which sells trendy clothing in sizes 1 through 16, last summer featured plus-size model Jennie Runk, who is a size 12 or 14, in its swimsuit ads . But retail analysts and plus-size women say there's something else at play: Stereotypes about larger women not wanting to dress fashionably keep companies from making clothes that are flattering to them. And in turn, that discourages them from spending more. 'There is still an interesting stigma attached to plus-size fashion and the woman who wears it,' says Marie Denee, who wears a size 16 and studies the industry via her website TheCurvyFashionista.com. 'Many think 'Oh, she doesn't want to draw attention, live life, date, be confident, wear fitted clothes with bold colors and patterns,' when the exact opposite is true.' Carmen Barrington, 32, says that attitude has resulted in fewer plus-size options. Barrington, who wears around a size 22, lamented recently after a day of shopping at Forever 21, Lane Bryant and other stores that she sometimes can't even find decent plus-size clothing at retailers that specialize in it. 'It was a hot, annoying day, and I spent it trying on stuff, and came up with nothing,' Barrington, who works in human resources, says. 'There's this aversion to being associated with plus-size clothes.' To be sure, sizing is an inexact science. Women's sizes were developed in the 1920s as catalogues became popular . and ready-to-wear clothing replaced tailor made or self-sewn items. 'There is still an interesting stigma attached to plus-size fashion and the woman who wears it' But while a system of men's standard sizing based on chest sizes in the Army had worked well, a similar attempt to base women's sizes on bust measurements wasn't as reliable. Women's bust sizes are more variable. In the 1930s, retailers began adopting even-numbered sizes commonly ranging from 14 to 24, says Alaina Zulli, a dressmaker who studies costume history. But those sizes bore little resemblance to those used today — a size 24 back then, for instance, would be a size 14 today — so the issues of not having enough plus-size fashions likely was not as pronounced. The sizes stayed the same but the numbers decreased gradually, Zulli says, about 1 size a decade. This is known as 'vanity sizing' because it gives women the allusion that they're fitting into a smaller size. Women's sizes, which today range from 0 to 24 but vary from store to store, haven't evolved much for decades. And for the most part, neither have the range of plus-size fashions. As a result, the amount spent on women's plus-size clothing annually has only risen by one percentage point to 9 percent since 2011, the furthest back plus-size data available from research firm NPD Group. Helping hand: Fashion retailer ModCloth hired an expert to guide its designers in making larger sizes . 'If the offering becomes stronger, women will spend more,' says Alison Levy, a retail strategist at consulting firm Kurt Salmon. 'There's a significant dollar opportunity in what is currently a very depressed apparel segment that retailers should be looking to exploit.' Some retailers have started to do just that. H&M, a European-based retailer that sells trendy clothing in the U.S. equivalent of sizes 1 through 16, last summer featured plus-size model Jennie Runk, who is a size 12 or 14, in its swimsuit ads. 'Our aim is not to convey a certain message or show an ideal, but to have a campaign which can illustrate the collection in an inspiring and clear way,' said Andrea Roos, an H&M spokeswoman. 'If the offering becomes stronger, women . will spend more. There's a significant dollar opportunity that retailers should be . looking to exploit' Lane Bryant, a plus size retailer, said earlier this month that it is expanding into higher-end designer clothing. It will debut its first designer collaboration with Isabel and Ruben Toledo on a collection of holiday clothes and later a spring line. 'This is a big deal for us and we're treating it in that manner in every way we can,' said Linda Heasley, Lane Bryant's CEO. And online retailer Asos three years ago launched a plus-size category called Asos Curve with sizes 14 to 24. The company fits everything on a size 16 model to 'ensure we are offering the right fit and comfort to our customers,' says Natasha Smith, an Asos Curve buyer. The company wouldn't disclose sales figures but said they've been stronger each season. 'Our customer comes in all shapes and sizes and our range should reflect that,' Smith says. But for every chain adding to their plus-size offerings, there are many others that continue to cater to smaller sizes. Abercrombie & Fitch, for instance, has been criticized for only offering sizes 0 to 10 and its CEO's comments that the chain caters to 'cool' and 'attractive' kids. The company says it is an 'aspirational brand' which targets a 'particular segment of customers.' The comments received widespread backlash online and Abercrombie has since begun anti-bullying initiatives. But it has not begun offering bigger sizes. Sellout success: Blogger Gabi Gregg's first 'fatkini' collection in sizes 10 to 24 for Swimsuits For All, sold out within hours of going on sale in May - to the frustration of thousands of eager fans . Whether to carry plus-size clothing is a risk calculation for most retailers, said Daniel Butler, a vice president for the National Retail Federation. 'Most retailers can't afford to fit everybody,' he says. Indeed, Alison Diboll, founder of Gabriella Rossetti, a new high-end line of women's clothing ranging from size 12 to 22, agrees that it's a tough choice for retailers. The Gabriella Rossetti line offers plus-size skirts for $250 and jackets for $650. But Diboll acknowledges that designer clothes for plus-sizes can be more complex than smaller sizes. 'You can't just take a size 6 and upsize it for (a size) 20 and expect it to work,' she says. That's a challenge ModCloth, an online . clothing retailer that sells clothes by indie designers, faced when it . decided to start offering plus sizes. ModCloth regularly works with . 1,500 designers, but none of them offered plus sizes, says Samara Fetto, . a category manager at the San Francisco-based retailer. 'Plus-size consumers are hungry for more options, unique options, not just same thing off the rack' 'More times than not, they were excited about entering the space but ... extremely inexperienced,' she says. But, she added that 'they didn't have plus size knowledge or expertise.' After ModCloth hired an expert to help the designers learn how to make larger sizes, the retailer started selling plus sizes a year ago and officially launched the category in June. Now, more than 100 vendors offer plus sizes and Modcloth's sales of plus-size items have quadrupled within the year. 'The plus-size customer definitely feels excluded in many areas of the fashion industry,' says Fetto. That customer has been gaining a voice on social media lately. Emily Sandford, who wears around a size 24, started a weight loss and plus-size fashion blog Authenticallyemmie.com, in 2009. 'The blogging world is helping open up people's eyes to what is available and what isn't available,' she says. Another popular plus-size blogger, Gabi Gregg, collaborated this summer with swimsuit designer Swimsuits for All on a swimsuit line — typically an underserved category for plus sizes. The two-piece suits, nicknamed the 'fatkini,' with colorful designs such as a starry galaxy print, sold out quickly after it launched. 'Plus-size consumers are hungry for more options, unique options, not just same thing off the rack,' Sandford says. 'I hope retailers that have not gone into plus sizes realize we have the same amount of disposable income just like every other shopper.'",The average U.S. woman is about 25lbs heavier than she was in 1960.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Apple hasn’t even confirmed that it’s working on a smartwatch yet, but that hasn’t stopped a wave of designers creating concepts of what the so-called iWatch could look like. Previous concepts resembled the square and clunky design of Samsung’s Galaxy Gear, yet the latest images from Californian designer Todd Hamilton imagine a much more sleek and elegant curved device. Hamilton took inspiration from fitness bands, as well as the look and functionality of Apple’s iOS7, to create a watch that is ‘like something Apple would actually produce.' Scroll down for video . Previous iWatch concepts have resembled the . square and clunky design of Samsung’s Galaxy Gear, yet the latest . designs from Californian designer Todd Hamilton imagine a much more sleek and elegant curved device, pictured . Speculation around Apple's iWatch began at the end of 2012 and a rumoured release date was initially set for the fourth quarter of 2013. Chinese websites reported in December 2012 that the computer giant was working with chip-maker Intel on a wrist-worn gadget. It was said to have a 1.5inch screen and use Bluetooth to communicate with other devices, including an iPhone. Other . rumours suggest the iWatch will feature Siri voice controls that let . users dictate messages, rather than use the tiny screen. The watch could also be used as a remote control to change music tracks or pause video, on the phone or tablet. In July last year, reports in the Financial Times said Apple was hiring outside help to tackle design problems with its iWatch. Further . reports in September claimed Apple was struggling to make a number of . iWatch components, meaning the release date would be pushed back. The concept watch is shown as a simple band, fitted round the wrist like the Nike Fuelband, with a curved touchscreen. The lockscreen is shown as having a basic black and white interface, and according to Hamilton, it would show the time and date, as well as a button to activate Apple’s voice assistant Siri. Hamilton explained that he wanted the concept lock screen to mimic those on the iPhone and iPad. This means users would swipe up to unlock, swipe down to see notifications and double-tap to open Siri. Once unlocked, the watch's homescreen would have four app icons stacked on top of each other, with a page controller on the right-hand side. Users would then swipe up or down to move between pages of apps, in a similar way iPhone users swipe left and right. The watch would additionally come with a physical home button, as well as volume controls, and pressing the home button would return users to the lockscreen. The new claims about a rounded design contradict previous reports the iWatch would have a curved screen, as seen in this concept by Todd Hamilton . Hamilton’s watch doesn’t just look the part, either. He also explained how menus would work: ‘One of the challenges I ran into was what to do about tabs.’ The iPhone and iPad has tabs across the bottom of the screen. ‘A normal tab view across the bottom wasn’t going to work so I came up with a simple drop down control in the title bar,’ continued Hamilton. ‘Tapping this would display a popover menu showing the other available pages. I also purposely left out several of the controls like Edit and Add Contact. ‘On a device this small I think it makes more sense to manage apps, contacts, and media from a synced iPhone or Mac.’ The lockscreen, pictured left, is shown with a basic black and white interface that would show the time and date, as well as feature a button to activate Apple’s voice assistant Siri. Once unlocked, the phone’s homescreen, pictured right, would have four app icons stacked with a page controller on the right-hand side . Hamilton said he 'wanted to retain a slim form factor like the Fuelband and incorporate familiar UI components from iOS 7. [The concept], pictured, needed to feel natural on the wrist and look like something Apple would actually produce' Similar to other smartwatches on the market, including the Pebble, Hamilton’s concept would connect to an iPhone via Bluetooth. Describing the design process on his blog, Hamilton said: ‘A few months ago Thomas Bogner posted an iWatch mockup that looked like a marriage between a Nike Fuelband and an iPhone. ‘It was an impressive concept that got a lot of people excited including myself. However, it had a major flaw: the orientation of the interface made it impossible to use. ‘I had some free time over the holidays so I decided to take a stab at the problem and create a more user friendly concept. ‘I wanted to retain a slim form factor like the Fuelband and incorporate familiar UI components from iOS 7. It needed to feel natural on the wrist and look like something Apple would actually produce.’ Previous iWatch concept images, including this one from MacUser magazine, featured a square screen, and a clunky design, that more closely resembled Samsung's Galaxy Gear smartwatch . Samsung beat Apple to the smartwatch market when it released its Android-powered Galaxy Gear, pictured, in September. However, its design, functionality and battery life has been heavily criticised and experts believe Apple may have delayed its iWatch release to learn more about what customers like, and don't like .","This latest concept was created by Californian designer Todd Hamilton .

"By . John Hall . At least 10 people have been killed and hundreds injured after a typhoon swept through the central Philippines, knocking out power lines in much of the country. Winds of up to 115mph brought down trees and electrical posts, badly damaged a parked plane and tore the roof of schools and government buildings as Typhoon Rammasun forced 370,000 people to flee their homes in high-risk villages and seek emergency shelter. But the death toll would almost certainly be higher had the Typhoon not suddenly changed direction shortly before reaching the capital Manila, heading instead towards the South China Sea. Desperate: A resident of Quezon city carries a tank of liquified petroleum gas after evacuating his home as Typhoon Rammasun nears. Winds of up to 115mph have brought down trees and electrical posts, badly damaged a parked plane and tore the roof of schools and government buildings . Take cover: Residents of Baseco - a slum community near Manila - evacuate to safer ground as Typhoon Rammasun closed in on the capital. The storm changed direction at the last minute, however, continuing on a more rural path and potentially sparing hundreds of lives . Motorists drive past fallen trees after Typhoon Rammasun battered Taguig city, east of Manila. Typhoon Rammasun knocked out power in many areas of the country . The typhoon weakened before blowing out . of the country this morning, heading toward northern Vietnam or . China's Hainan Island, forecaster Jori Loiz said. But he warned that the typhoon could easily regain strength while crossing the South China Sea. In a shantytown at the edge of Manila Bay, hundreds fled when strong wind tore tin roofs. Most were drenched before they reached an evacuation center with the help of emergency workers. Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada said he was relieved there were no reported deaths after the typhoon sideswiped his city, although its wind still downed trees and damaged seaside shanties, prompting more than 1,000 residents to evacuate. 'It was like a drill...We hauled people away from dangerous seaside areas, whether they liked it or not,' he said. Cleaning up: A young boy tries to sweep out floating debris from their flooded home as Typhoon Rammasun batters suburban Quezon city, north of Manila. The Philippines' densely-populated northern provinces avoided a direct hit as the storm's fierce wind shifted slightly from the centre of the country . Drenched: Workers at a fishing port brave strong winds and rain as Typhoon Rammasun hit Navotas, north of Manila earlier this morning . Officials reported at least 10 deaths in the Philippines as a whole, mostly people killed in remote towns and villages by falling trees and electrical posts. A fire volunteer died when he was hit by a block of concrete while hauling down a Philippine flag in Pasig city, said Francis Tolentino - chairman of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority. At Manila International airport, the left wing of a Singapore Airlines Boeing 777 was damaged after gusts pushed it against a bridge passageway, said manager Angel Honrado. No one was injured. Three fishermen were reported missing in Catanduanes, near Albay province, where Typhoon Rammasun made landfall late last night. Repairs: Residents try to fix their stall at a market in Taguig City, east of Manila as the bad weather forced 370,000 people to flee their homes . Seeking shelter: A young boy in Manila evacuates to safer grounds at the onslaught of Typhoon Rammasun, which is known locally known as 'Glenda' There were no immediate estimates of the damage in communities that lost power and telephone connections while being pummeled by the wind and rain. With last year's massive devastation and deaths from Typhoon Haiyan still in many people's mind, officials said people readily evacuated after being told of the danger. Polangui Mayor Cherilie Mella Sampal said 10,000 of the 80,000 residents in Albay town, about 340 kilometers (210 miles) southeast of Manila, left homes before the typhoon struck Tuesday. Sampal said she saw the wind topple electric posts and lift roofs off houses. Battered: A man holds a large umbrella at the onslaught of Typhoon Rammasun. The storm has knocked out power in much of the country and has killed 10 people . Business as usual: A delivery truck negotiates flooded roads as Typhoon Rammasun batters suburban Navotas, north of Manila. The typhoon weakened before blowing out of the country this morning, heading toward northern Vietnam or China's Hainan Island . Sampal said residents were worried after witnessing Haiyan's horrific aftermath in the central Philippines last November. At least 6,300 people died and more than 1,000 were left missing. 'We're used to and prepared for calamities...But when people heard that the eye of the typhoon will hit the province, they feared we may end up like the victims""  of Haiyan,' Sampul said. Rammasun - the Thai term for god of thunder - is the seventh storm to batter the Philippines this year. About 20 typhoons and storm lash the archipelago on the western edge of the Pacific each year, making it one of the world's most disaster-prone countries. With experts predicting Typhoon Rammasun could gain strength as it heads towards China, deadly floods have already forced tens of thousands of residents to flee their homes in one of the country's most ancient towns. The mass evacuations came after heavy rainfall in Hunan province caused the Tuojiang river to burst its banks, leaving residents of Fenghuang and its surrounding countryside trudging through neck-deep water in some of the worst hit areas. Bridges have been badly damaged, cutting off parts of the town altogether, and up to 50,000 tourists and locals were affected by a near-total electricity blackout.

"A Montana strip club patron was so unhappy with the service that he called 911 to complain - but in the end it was he who landed in trouble with the law. William McDaniel, 53, from Butte, Montana, contacted police last Saturday night to complain that an exotic dancer refused to have sex with him at Sagebrush Sam's Nightclub in the town of Rocker. Mr McDaniel explained to officers that he paid $350 for a private dance at the establishment but did not get the desired outcome. Hey, big spender: William McDaniel, 53, pictured left and right in a booking photo, was charged with soliciting prostitution after calling police to complain that a stripper refused to have sex with him . Montana hotspot: McDaniel paid $350 for a private dance at Sagebrush Sam's Nightclub in the town of Rocker, Montana, but the performance came to an end after he allegedly became 'sexually aggressive' The X-rated performance was supposed to include multiple songs, but when McDaniel became 'sexually aggressive,' according to police, the lap dance came to an abrupt end. ‘He felt he was ripped off by the bar,’ Butte-Silver Bow Undersheriff George Skuletich told the Helena Independent Record. The patron's laments, however, fell on deaf ears since under state law it is illegal to offer money in exchange for sexual favors. Mr McDaniel, who until recently was employed by a company specializing in contamination cleanups, was arrested and charged with misdemeanor soliciting prostitution. Ladies' man: McDaniel, pictured here with a staffer at the infamous Heart Attack Grill, apparently felt that he did not get his money's worth the Rocker strip joint . Checkered past: McDaniel, pictured left at work on his birthday earlier this month, has prior convictions for DUIs and drug possession . The unsatisfied customer was released Sunday after posting bond. According to jail records, McDaniel’s criminal history includes convictions for felony DUIs and possession of dangerous drugs. There is no indication that Mr McDaniel is married, but according to his Facebook page, the 53-year-old has at least two young grandchildren.","William McDaniel, 53, told police he paid $350 for a private dance at Sagebrush Sam's nightclub in Montana, but the stripper spurned him .

"By . Associated Press . An Alabama federal judge charged with domestic violence following his arrest in Atlanta is embarrassed and entering a treatment program, one of his attorneys said on Wednesday. Barry Ragsdale is representing U.S. District Judge Mark Fuller of Montgomery in an administrative complaint filed by the chief judge of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. He said Fuller already has sought counseling and will check into a treatment program within days. In treatment: Mark Fuller said he is embarrassed and entering a treatment program after being charged with domestic violence against his wife . Fuller is seeking a program 'that is best for his situation and circumstances,' Ragsdale said, but he declined to elaborate on the type Fuller is seeking. 'He's embarrassed for this,' said Ragsdale, an old friend of Fuller from law school. 'He's embarrassed for his colleagues and his family.' The 11th Circuit already has stripped Fuller of his cases and stopped sending him new ones. The judge isn't at home in Montgomery, where his wife remains, Ragsdale said. Atlanta police arrested the 55-year-old judge on Aug. 10 and charged him with misdemeanor battery after his wife called 911 from a hotel and said he was beating her. Mark Fuller told police his wife became violent as she confronted him with allegations of cheating. The police report states that Kelli Fuller, 41, 'answered the door in tears' and had visible cuts on her mouth and forehead when police arrived. They later documented bruises on her legs. Kelli Fuller was treated at the hotel by paramedics but refused to be taken to a hospital. Police say the judge was on the bed when they entered the room, which smelled of alcohol. There was broken glass and hair on the floor. Blood was discovered in the bathroom. Kelli Fuller told police that her husband became violent after she accused him of having an affair with a law clerk in his Montgomery office. She said he pulled her hair, threw her to the ground and dragged her, kicked her and struck her several times in the face. Kelli Fuller's 17-year-old son, Hunter Gregg, also was at the hotel. He told police that he heard his mother and step-father fighting earlier in the evening as he passed by their room. He said they had been drinking and described a volatile relationship, telling police 'this was not the first time an incident like this had occurred.' Fuller was released from jail and is free on $5,000 bond. He was scheduled to appear in court on Friday in Atlanta but the hearing has been delayed until Sept. 5, records show. Big case: Fuller presided over the public corruption trial of former . Alabama governor Don Siegelman (left) and former HealthSouth CEO Richard . Scrushy (right) Ragsdale said the delay was routine and not related to Fuller's decision to seek help. The battery case could be resolved at the next hearing, Ragsdale said. An Atlanta attorney is representing Fuller in the criminal case. U.S. Circuit Judge Gerald Tjoflat, acting as the chief judge of the 11th Circuit, sent Fuller a complaint following his arrest to begin the judicial discipline process outlined under federal law, Ragsdale said. While federal judges serve lifetime appointments and can be removed only through impeachment, legal experts say they also are subject to administrative procedures that can result in censure, reprimands or a request for their resignation. Fuller has three weeks to respond to the complaint by Tjoflat. 'The complaint essentially recites the press reports,' said Ragsdale. 'It basically says, ""Explain yourself.""' Federal law doesn't have a provision for the suspension of judges, and Fuller is still receiving his annual salary of $199,100 while not hearing cases. James P. Gerstenlauer, chief executive of the 11th Circuit, said federal law states that judges' pay cannot be cut as long as they are in office. Appointed by former President George W. Bush, Fuller is best known for presiding over the public corruption trial of former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman and former HealthSouth CEO Richard Scrushy, who were both convicted in 2006 and went to prison.","Atlanta police arrested Mark Fuller on  August 10 and charged him with misdemeanor battery after his wife .

"By . Ashley Collman for MailOnline . A 15-year-old girl was sent home on the first day of high school last week because her red hair was too 'distracting' to other students. However, Muscle Shoals High School sophomore Hayleigh Black says she's been dying her head bright red for the past three years and no one at the school has complained before. 'I have never had anybody come up to me and say, ""Maybe you shouldn't have this color,"" or, ""Do you think that's a bad color,""' Hayleigh told WAFF. Now, Hayleigh and her parents are threatening to sue the school unless they excuse her absence and let her dye her hair back. Scroll down for video . Distraction? Hayleigh Black, 15, was sent home from school on the first day last week because her red hair (left) was too 'distracting'. She has since stripped the color (right) so as not to miss more class time . Turned around: Hayleigh's mom Pam Boyd had to pick her up from Muscle Shoals High School less than 30 minutes after dropping her off for the first day . Hayleigh's mother Pam Boyd said she got a call less than 30 minutes after dropping her daughter off on the first day of school - before Hayleigh even made it to homeroom. Administrators allegedly sent multiple students home that day for distracting hair colors, which is violates a student handbook rule against 'distracting' or 'disruptive' hair styles. Boyd says she knows about the rule, but didn't think her daughter was in violation since she's never been sent home for her red hair before. 'I told the principal, I said, '""You were her assistant principal last year. How come you never sent her home last year?"" It's the same color as always,' Boyd told ABC. Hayleigh says she's been dying her hair for three years now, and never received a complaint about it at school before . While the principal has not offered an explanation for Hayleigh's dismissal, schools Superintendent Brian Lindsay told ABC that he stands by the decision. 'The principal is just following the policy. Several girls were sent home for hair color,' Lindsey said. 'Most everyone complied and came back and are back in class.' 'The policy was put in place years ago,' Lindsay said, adding that it 'very rarely ever comes up as an issue' and was created to 'provide a safe environment conducive to learning.' Hayleigh complied with the school's policy and has since stripped the color out of her hair. She was allowed back in school the following day, but her parents intend to fight the absence and petition the school's administration to let their daughter re-dye her hair. 'She's been a little down,' Boyd said. 'She misses her hair color. I'm upset for her. I just felt very angered that my child - a good student, no problems ever - is having her feet knocked out from under her on the first day of school.' If the school does not agree to the family's terms, they intent to file a federal lawsuit.","Hayleigh Black was sent home on the first day of school because administrators found her hair violated a rule against 'disruptive' hair styles .

"By . Michael Zennie for MailOnline . David Gregory has been fired as moderator of the venerable NBC interview show 'Meet the Press' after years of slumping ratings that saw the program falls behind rivals ABC and CBS. The network announced that chief White House correspondent Chuck Todd will replace him a host on September 7. Shortly before NBC made the change public, Gregory took to Twitter to announce he was leaving the network: 'I leave NBC as I came - humbled and grateful. I love journalism and serving as moderator of MTP was the highest honor there is. 'I have great respect for my colleagues at NBC News and wish them all well. To the viewers, I say thank you.' Scroll down for video . Out with the old, in with the new: David Gregory (left), who has hosted 'Meet the Press' for six years, could be replace with Chuck Todd (right) as early as this Sunday . Resignation: David Gregory told his 1.7million followers that he was leaving NBC. His resignation came before network executives could announce he was being replaced . A memo from NBC News President Deborah Turness praised Gregory's 'remarkable gift for holding leaders to account,' but several news sources report that he was forced out. He has led the the Sunday program since the death of Tim Russert six years ago. According to CNN's Brian Stelter, he was not even allowed to host a final show before his dismissal.  Stelter reports that Gregory is currently vacationing in New Hampshire with his wife. Todd currently has his own morning show on MSNBC, 'The Daily Rundown,' which airs weekdays at 9am. Ratings for 'Meet the Press' have been slumping for years. Last year, they hit 2.9million - the lowest level in 21 years as the show fell to third behind ABC rival 'This Week' and CBS' 'Face the Nation.' And ratings have continued to nose-dive.TV Newser reports that on August 3, just 2.1million people tuned in - and only 584,000 from the vital 25-54 age demographic. Earlier this week, Politico reported that NBC had anointed Todd as its new 'Meet the Press' moderator. 'The move is an effort by NBC News President Deborah Turness to restore passion and insider cred to a network treasure that has been adrift since the death in 2008 of the irreplaceable Tim Russert,' Politico's Mike Allen said. The white-haired Gregory was a rising star at NBC when he was appointed replace Russert - whose sudden death was widely mourned by the political establishment. Media watcher say NBC hopes Chuck Todd's sources and his 'political junkie' enthusiasm will draw viewers back in to the show, which is known for its long, in-depth interviews with politicians and other newsmakers. Todd, 42, grew up in Miami and is a devoted University of Miami Hurricanes fan. He attended George Washington University in Washington, DC. - first majoring in music, then in political science - but never graduated. He has served as NBC's chief White House Correspondent since 2008. Politico reports that he has since developed a devoted following of  politicians, policymakers and other Washington insiders. 'Meet the Press' is one of NBC's marquee programs. On the air since November 6, 1947, it has the distinction of being the longest-running show on TV. Gregory is the 11th moderator of the show.","David Gregory has hosted the venerable political interview show for six years - since the death of then-moderator Tim Russert .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor, MailOnline . and Francesca Chambers for MailOnline . President Barack Obama declared a mission-accomplished moment on Thursday while promising that the U.S. would continue to deliver airstrikes against the ISIS terror group whenever it threatens American interests. He announced during a brief pre-golf speech that a U.S. military operation had 'almost flawlessly' helped tens of thousands of stranded Iraqi refugees reach safety following a harrowing week trapped on a remote mountainside. But 'we will continue airstrikes,' he vowed, threatening ISIS as it continues its rape-and-pillage approach to regime change. 'We broke the [ISIS] seige of Mt. Sinjar,' he said, referring to the self-declared Islamic State group's reign of terror against the Yadizi religious minority group in Iraqi Kurdistan. 'We helped vulnerable people reach safety, and we helped save thousands of lives,' Obama told reporters. Haggard: A golf-weary Obama said Iraq's Yazidis had escaped ISIS but promised the U.S. would continue airstrikes against the terror group -- without putting boots on the ground . The anti-punctual president: Obama kept the press waiting for a half-hour past his speech's announced starting time before speaking for just a few minutes at a school in Edgartown, Massachusetts . On the run: Displaced Yazidis waited for food and water on Wednesday at the Iraqi-Syrian border crossing in Dohuk province, even as they escaped ISIS on Mt. Sinjar . There will be no more missions to help the Yazidis, he said, and 'the majority of the military personnel who conducted the assessment will be leaving Iraq in the coming days.' He terms the mission an 'assessment' because the role of military Special Forces was limited to little more than an aerial head-count. Within hours of the deployment on Wednesday, a flyover mission confirmed that only around 5,000 Iraqi refugees remained, out of an estimated 45,000 who had sought safety on Mt. Sinjar. The Department . of Defense confirmed Wednesday evening that most of the Yazidi refugees had already taken . themselves out of harm's way, in part because Kurdish Peshmerga . fighters had cleared a path for them to leave safely. The Pentagon also credited its own military attacks on ISIS targets, and humanitarian aid that helped sustain the people who were in harms' way. Obama has been on vacation for the last six days, but the commander-in-chief looked more gray and haggard than ever as he delivered his update on Iraq and a statement about violence in Ferguson, Missouri. He partied late into the evening yesterday at a birthday celebration for a longtime family friend, and danced to nearly every song, according to a White House pool report. Tired as he may be, the president was back out on links immediately after his public address to play his fourth round of golf since he arrived in Martha's Vineyard on Saturday. He said in his remarks Thursday that the U.S. had 'conducted humanitarian airdrops every night' since Friday, 'delivering more than 114,000 meals and 35,000 gallons of fresh water.' The military assessment on Wednesday, he confirmed, 'found that food and water had been reaching those in need, and that thousands ... had evacuated each and every night. Obama declared victory over ISIS in the siege of Mt. Sinjar, but said more airstrikes will come . Yazidi refugees desperately grab juice drink cartons as they are thrown. A ten-day stand-off at the mountain by ISIS appears to have been crushed after U.S. bomb drops and a fightback by Kurdish forces allowed nearly 45,000 refugees to escape without a US escort . Rear . Admiral John Kirby, a DOD spokesman, said Wednesday that 'there are far . fewer Yazidis on Mt. Sinjar than previously feared, in part because of . humanitarian air drops [and] air strikes on [ISIS] targets.' The situation on the ground elsewhere in Iraq, however, 'remains dire,' said Obama. He . predicted that the U.S. would continue to provide humanitarian aid in . other regions of the beseiged country, 'without committing troops on the . ground.' That pledge has raised eyebrows since Special Forces did in fact land on Mt. Sinjar. The White House has repeatedly framed 'boots on the ground' scenarios as only those that include armed battles with the Islamic State's militants. Obama announced six days ago that he would authorize military airstrikes in northern Iraq  against the terror group's forces who were threatening as many as 45,000 Yazidis, a religious minority group whose people fled to the remote Mt. Sinjar – and were left without food or water. Following targeted airstrikes that launched just hours later, and after several days of humanitarian aid airlifts, Obama deployed 130 special forces personnel to the region on Wednesday with an eye toward organizing an evacuation. SAS forces from the UK also participated in the deployment, which began less than a day after Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told a group of more than 200 Marines at Camp Pendleton that 'there will be no boots on the ground in Iraq.'","President said to expect more military strikes against ISIS if they threaten US personnel .

Tony Halloun, who was hired to concrete Dr Khalid Qidwai’s driveway, went to his surgery and asked for $3,500 but Dr Qidwai refused to pay before the job was done. This response allegedly prompted Halloun to use the chilling words ‘I'll win in the end’. The following day Dr Qidwai’s wife, Shahnaz Qidwai, 65, was found bashed to death in their  home called Burnham Castle in Henley - a little known but wealthy suburb in northwest Sydney. Halloun, who has pleaded not guilty to the murder, had arrived at the house at about 7.40 that morning then Dr Qidwai left to go to his Croydon surgery about 9am. Halloun is alleged to have told police that three armed intruders stormed into the house telling him ‘don't worry, we are not here for you’ and then he said the men ordered him to ‘get her’. So Halloun then grabbed Mrs Qidwai by the hair and dragged her, ‘kicking and screaming’. The last time he saw her, Halloun said she had tears streaming down her face and a gun to her head. ‘She was in fear for her life,’  he said. Scroll down for video . 'I'll win in the end' are the chilling words of Tony Halloun (pictured) believed to have been said to Dr Khalid Qidwai the day before he allegedly murdered the doctor's wife in their Sydney home . The following day Dr Qidwai's wife, Shahnaz Qidwai, 65, was found bashed to death in their multi-million dollar waterfront home in Henley, northwest Sydney . Halloun, who was hired to concrete the Qidwai's driveway (pictured), went to Dr Qidwai's surgery and asked him for $3,500 but he refused to pay before the job was done which prompted Halloun's threatening words . Halloun said he then went to his car, smoked a cigarette and waited to see if the men came out, then about 40 minutes later he left the Qidwai’s property. On the opening day of his trial on Tuesday, the Supreme Court heard the labourer contacted police a year after he was charged with the crime and said he had ‘more information’ about that fatal day on June 15, 2012. It was one of three inconsistent versions of events that the financially-stressed Halloun gave after Mrs Qidwai was bashed to death inside her home, crown prosecutor Giles Tabuteau told the jury on Tuesday. When the couple's youngest daughter Maha, 28, came home at 2pm, she found her mother on the floor near her bed with her face and mouth covered in blood and bruises - she was cold to touch. Halloun had left more than two hours earlier. Crown prosecutor Giles Tabuteau  (pictured) said Halloun took $3,400 from the home which Mrs Qidwai was organising the money to pay her husband's staff around the time of the attack . Mr Tabuteau said Halloun fabricated three different versions of events in order to explain DNA and crime scene evidence . At the time of Mrs Qidwai's death, the court heard she had been organising the money to pay her husband's staff and had about $3,400 in envelopes in the home. 'The crown case is that the money was taken at the time of or moments after the attack on Mrs Qidwai and that it was the accused who took that money,' Mr Tabuteau said. The crown says Halloun's business was $97,000 in debt. After police questioned him about the murder, Mr Tabuteau said he fabricated three different versions of events in order to explain DNA and crime scene evidence. But Halloun's barrister Peter Lange questioned that Halloun's financial difficulties provided a motive. 'What does common sense tell you about a robbery worth $2000 to $4000? ... is that a motive to kill the wife of your employer?' he said. The trial continues.

"By . Dan Bloom . A Hollywood actor has relived the day his three-year-old son came to the brink of death - after eating just one cashew nut. John Schwab was on a family holiday on the Spanish island of Menorca when a severe allergic reaction gripped his son Jack, covering his skin in hives and closing up his throat. By sheer chance a neighbouring holidaymaker had an adrenaline shot, a miracle which the 41-year-old and his wife Tamsin are convinced saved their son's life. Scroll down for video . Shock: John Schwab almost lost his son Jack (left) to a single cashew nut after the young boy suffered a devastating allergic reaction on a family holiday. By sheer chance a neighbour had an adrenaline shot . Danger: The three-year-old spent five days on a hospital ward in Menorca (right) recovering from the reaction . They drove Jack at breakneck speeds to a Spanish hospital, where he spent five days recovering. At first his eyes were so swollen that he could not see, his father said, and his condition was so distressing that it prompted two junior nurses to burst into tears. Nine years later, he is a happy-go-lucky secondary school pupil and a chorister at London's Southwark Cathedral - but still carries a rucksack with adrenaline shots everywhere he goes. Mr Schwab, whose film credits include Zero Dark Thirty and Space Odyssey: Voyage to the Planets, spoke out about the incident as a warning to other parents to have their children allergy tested. The actor, who lives with ITV employee Tamsin, their son Jack and Jack's six-year-old brother Sammy in Blackheath, south east London, said the horror of the incident changed their lives. He became a prominent member of the Anaphylaxis Campaign charity and raises awareness of allergic reactions, which the charity says kill 20 people a year. Family trauma: Mr Schwab did not take photos of his son when he was first brought to hospital, but was able to play with him again as the family realised he was going to survive the reaction. Pictured: The pair in hospital . Puffy: Jack after he was released from hospital, with his face still visibly swollen from the effects of the nut . The charity recorded a heart-warming film of Mr Schwab recalling the incident on the unluckiest day of his life - Friday 13 May, 2005. Mr Schwab said his son had eaten peanuts and other snacks all his life, but never a cashew nut. Just 15 seconds after tasting one in their holiday villa, he 'came running into the room with a look of panic on his face', the actor said. Recovered: Jack (second from left with his parents and brother Sammy) is now 12 . 'Then he vomited uncontrollably on the floor, and he looked at me with a strange pleading look,' he said. 'I knew something was wrong, very wrong. Instinctively I turned to Tamsin and said, ""he's allergic to nuts"". 'I would like to say that my wife and I were the personification of calm. I've played doctors on screen and stage, I've watched endless doctors' procedures on television, but all I could come up with was: ""get some help"".' His skin covered in hives, Jack arrived with his parents at an emergency room on the Spanish island which Mr Schwab said was full of 'English people with sunburn', and waited half an hour to see a doctor. By the time they were with the doctor, Jack was having a second reaction - but could not be treated at the clinic. His parents were told to take him to the island's main hospital in a fellow holidaymaker's car. 'Jack took a turn for the worse,' said Mr Schwab. 'He began panicking, he couldn't stop convulsing. 'Our friend turned into a Formula 1 driver - I don't think he stopped for a single red light. He got us to the hospital in 15 minutes, not 30, which I think is still a Menorcan island record. 'We would later learn that this hospital was not equipped for the kind of emergency we had presented them with. From behind the double doors of doom I could hear my son screaming, yelling, pleading. 'I went into the emergency room and Jack already had four needles in him. He was distraught, surrounded by people in white coats and every passing minute brought another doctor running through the doors. 'Of course the medical attendees never spoke English. Then two junior nurses looked at each other and started crying. I wasn't feeling very confident. A lesson for all parents: Jack is now 12 years old and is a chorister at Southwark Cathedral in south London . Family: Mr and Mrs Schwab said they learned a lot from the experience and now campaign on the issue . 'Then I left my body - genuinely and seriously - and I knew in an instant why people have out-of-body experiences, because their heart, mind and soul cannot take what is presented to them. 'I floated in the corner of that emergency room watching myself watch my son die. Anaphylaxis is triggered when a sensitised individual comes in to contact with one of a huge range of allergens. These can include nuts, milk, eggs, bee and wasp venom, kiwi fruit, Latex rubber and even exercise. A reaction can cause a drop in blood pressure, and swelling in the face, mouth and throat leading to a narrowing of the airways, difficulty breathing, collapse and even death. Parents can have their children tested for most common allergies free on the NHS, via a GP. The skin prick test involves injecting a trace of the allergen into the skin and monitoring whether it causes a reaction. The Anaphylaxis Campaign, which recorded Mr Schwab's story, offers advice to parents, schools and caterers to reduce the risk of fatal incidents. Chief executive Lynne Regent said: 'John and Jack’s story is very moving and could easily have ended . in tragedy. 'Unfortunately, however, it is the sort of story we hear on a . weekly basis at the Anaphylaxis Campaign. Deaths from anaphylaxis do . occur, in fact, there are on average 20 deaths every year.' For more advice visit anaphylaxis.org.uk. 'Jack stared at me and said one word: ""Daddy"". I couldn't tell whether it was a question, a statement, a plea, an affirmation or an acceptance. I answered: ""I love you"".' The doctors managed to save Jack, who spent five days in hospital. He is now 12 years old and attends a secondary school near his London home, where he is even permitted to have school dinners. Others are not as lucky as Jack. This week an inquest heard how a teenager with a nut allergy died after eating ribs from a Chinese takeaway. William Luckett, 15, was unaware that the barbecue sauce he ordered near his home on the Isle of Wight was prepared with peanut butter. After a few bites he began struggling to breathe, the Isle of Wight Coroner’s Court heard. William was taken to hospital by ambulance but died shortly after. His father Steve Luckett, 45, told the court how he 'cradled' his son as he lay dying. Speaking of the tragic case, Mr Schwab said: 'It's horrible and it just makes me think how easily it could happen to us, to anyone. It's heartbreaking for the family and my heart goes out to them.' In Mr Schwab's case, there was more than a hint of the supernatural about events of that day nine years ago. All day they had searched in vain for a traditional figurine of the Virgin Mary to take home as a souvenir for his father. And when Mr Schwab asked the mystery saviour with an adrenaline pen for her name, she turned to him and said simply: 'It's Mary'. At the end of a harrowing day, he phoned his father. 'Dad,' he said. 'I think I found your Mary'.","John Schwab, from London, was in Zero Dark Thirty and Space Odyssey .

"By . Leon Watson for MailOnline . Mental health problems: Neil Cumming stabbed wife of 16 years Jane to death at their family home in Longforgan, Perthshire . A man who stabbed his wife to death is suing the NHS for failing to properly treat his mental illness before he attack her. Neil Cumming stabbed wife of 16 years Jane to death at their family home in Longforgan, Perthshire, in July 2011. Shortly after he deliberately crashed his car into a lorry at 100mph on the outskirts of Dundee in an attempt to take his own life. But, following a trial at the High Court in Glasgow, he was found not guilty of murder when a judge ordered a jury to acquit him by reason of insanity. Cumming, 48, was ordered to be detained at the State Hospital at Carstairs without limit of time and remains there today. Now he has lodged an action against Tayside Health Board at the Court of Session in Edinburgh. It is understood Cumming believes the NHS failed to exercise proper care towards him before the incident. A court earlier heard how doctors wanted to admit Cumming to a mental health facility the day before the killing - but couldn't as no beds were available. The case was due to call for the first time today. A spokeswoman for law firm Thorntons, who are representing Cumming in the action, said the sum of money being sought had not yet been established. She said: 'It is very much in the early stages. We are still making investigations into this.' The High Court in Glasgow previously heard that Cumming had a long history of mental health problems, having been diagnosed with persistent delusional disorder in 1999 when he believed his wife was poisoning him. He also thought he was being spied on when he worked at the Michelin tyre factory in Dundee. He had been admitted to the Carseview Centre at Dundee's Ninewells Hospital - a mental health unit - in the February before the killing. Advocate depute Alex Prentice QC told the court in a joint minute of agreed evidence read to a jury that Jane, 40, had tried to have him re-admitted to Carseview again days before her death. On Monday July 11 Jane had spoken to Cumming's community psychiatric nurse over her concerns for his mental state. Neil and Jane Cumming got married in 1996. Sixteen years later he killed her . The following day the CPN, a Mr Menzies, came to see Cumming and arranged for him to be seen later in the week by a Dr McLaren, who met the couple on Thursday July 14. Cumming's 'paranoia was obvious' during this meeting and he was asked if he had ever considered harming himself. He replied that he had not and that he loved his wife and children. Dr McLaren thought his medication needed to be reviewed and thought it best that was done with the accused being admitted to Carseview, but there were no beds available. It was decided that the accused would be referred to the Acute Mental Health Response Team who would monitor his condition in the community until a bed became available. The following morning he launched the violent attack - stabbing her 36 times with a knife on the body, arms and hands. He then drove at upwards of 100mph towards the outskirts of Dundee where he deliberately slammed into a lorry in an attempt to kill himself. Tests later showed he had a cocktail of drugs in his system at the time. Cumming told a nurse who had phoned Jane's mobile phone after she died that: 'I have committed a terrible crime.' Asked what he meant, he would only speak about his medication, telling her it had been tampered with and it was 'fake'. An appointment was made for him to attend at Carseview at 3pm that afternoon, an appointment he never kept. Cumming was trapped in his car with multiple fractures and abrasions. Firefighters and a trauma team freed him before taking him to Ninewells Hospital in Dundee. He was unconscious for several days in intensive care. Once he was deemed well enough, he was arrested and charged and Perth Sheriff Court convened at his hospital bed where he was fully committed for trial. John Hamilton QC, for Cumming, told the High Court in Glasgow: 'He is at pains to express publicly that he loved his wife dearly and still can't understand the events that led to him hurting her . 'He is truly sorry for what he has done and he appreciates that it will sound hollow given these tragic events. However, he wants to say sorry to his daughters and hopes they will understand he was ill when he did what he did. 'He also wants to say sorry to both families and thanks them both for their support.' An NHS Tayside spokeswoman said today: 'As this is a legal matter we are unable to comment.'","Neil Cumming killed his wife Jane at their family home in Perthshire .

"By . Reuters . A 41-year-old man who was arrested after border officials found two dying Mexican men in the trunk of his car at the U.S.-Mexican border wept in court on Wednesday as he was arraigned on a federal smuggling charge. Nicholas George Zakov appeared distraught as his court-appointed attorney entered a plea of innocent on his behalf during a brief hearing in U.S. District Court in San Diego. Following the hearing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Wheat said federal investigators were still probing the incident and plan to take the evidence, including the as-yet unfinished autopsy results, to a grand jury for an indictment in the next week. Custom border officers stopped Nicholas George Zakov in this orange Dodger Challenger at the U.S.-Mexican border on Tuesday, August 12 - two dying men were found in the trunk . Wheat said that the two men found last week in the trunk of the orange 2012 Dodge Challenger, identified as Tarcisio Casas-Blanco and Jose Quiroz-Casas, were from the Mexican state of Guanajuato. They had been caught in the United States illegally before and were voluntarily returned - a process where they waived hearings that might have led to formal deportation and instead were immediately returned to Mexico. According to the complaint, when Zakov arrived at the border inspection station after waiting in a line of cars for over an hour, he said he had nothing to declare.

However, he was selected at random for a secondary inspection, Wheat said and U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents using a scanner on the car found irregularities in the trunk. Upon opening the trunk, the customs agents found the two men unconscious - one was breathing and the other was not, Wheat said. Both men were later pronounced dead at a local hospital. Zakov, who is from North Dakota but now lives in the Los Angeles area, told federal investigators that he was supposed to be paid $3,500 for smuggling the men into the United States, according to the criminal complaint against him.","Nicholas George Zakov, 41, was arrested after border officials found two dying Mexican men in the trunk of his car at the U.S.-Mexican border .

Now investigators must sort out whether Pelrine's equipment malfunctioned and why the tragedy occurred even though the parachute was open when he smashed into the ground. Tragedy: An experienced skydiver plummeted to his death Sunday morning and now authorities are investigating whether his equipment malfunctioned . Medics pronounced the Boston resident dead at the scene, according to WCVB. He was a resident of the Mattapan neighborhood. The Federal Aviation Administration and Pepperell police are investigating. Perline's death, while tragic, is a rare outcome from what--statistically speaking--is a relatively safe sport. Each year, about 3 million decide to take the plunge. Perline leaped from the plane at Skydive Pepperell Center in Massachusetts. His parachute was open at the time of impact . In 2013, 3.2 million people leaped from planes. Twenty-four of them died. That means, on average, about .0075 of every 1000 jumps proves fatal according to the United States Parachute Association.

A Florida mother has been arrested after her 7-year-old son told her landlord she was cooking meth in the trunk of her car — and the boy even walked authorities through her recipe. For days, the boy told his landlord in the Orlando suburb of Edgewood that he wanted to show him 'mommy's bad stuff,' according to police reports. The 7-year-old said his mother, Briana Buchanan, 27, was cooking 'something bad.' On Friday, he once again said 'there's really bad stuff in my mom's car' — and this time he picked up the keys and took the landlord to see it. 'He opened up the car and he pointed to a bag and right away its everything you've seen online related to meth labs,' the man, Peter Arnold, told WESH-TV. Arnold, who considers the boy a nephew, called 911. The 7-year-old told police that, to make the 'bad stuff,' his mother 'goes to the store and lies to people that she is sick and needs medicine,' according to her arrest report. 'She then mixes the stuff she buys in a Gatorade bottle and she shakes it,' the boy told police, according to WESH-TV. On Facebook, Buchanan seems every bit the doting . mother, posting picture and picture with her 7-year-old son. But police . say that she often cooked methamphetamine in front of the boy, who . eventually called cops on her . Police also found syringes filled with meth inside the woman's home, the station reported. When confronted by officers, Buchanan admitted that she knew how to cook meth and had done it while her son was in the car, according to the Daytona Beach News-Journal. Buchanan is facing accusations of child neglect with great bodily harm and a slew of charges relating to possessing and manufacturing methamphetamine. She remains at the Volusia County Branch Jail, unable to post $32,000 bail, the News-Journal reported. The boy, whose name was not released, is now with his grandmother. 'I can already tell you, just looking at his face, he is relieved to be out of the situation,' Arnold told  News 13. Buchanan's charges may yet be upgraded to trafficking, which carries a stiffer sentence, the station reported.","Florida mom Briana Buchanan, 27, is charged with child neglect and manufacturing methamphetamine .

"By . Associated Press . and MailOnline Reporter . A Tulsa police officer has been charged with first-degree murder in the off-duty shooting death of his daughter's boyfriend earlier this month. Tulsa prosecutors formally charged Shannon Kepler Monday with the Aug. 5 killing of 19-year-old Jeremey Lake, who was dating his daughter Lisa. Kepler, 54, was also charged with one count of shooting with intent to kill because prosecutors say he shot at his daughter during an alleged confrontation in which Lake was killed. Kepler's wife, Gina Kepler, 48, was not charged Monday because prosecutors said there wasn't evidence to support it. She'd been arrested along with her husband on a complaint of being an accessory after the fact of murder.

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . Megan, pictured with her mother Victoria Nuttall, had been in a relationship with an older man . The angry mother of a 14-year-old girl who was found hanged in her bedroom - after an older man split up with her upon discovering her age - has questioned why police did not prosecute the 24-year-old who had sex with her daughter. Victoria Nuttall, the 39-year-old mother of tragic Megan Edmunds, claims the man knew her daughter was 13 at the time of their relationship, but does not believe its end was to blame for her death. Mrs Nuttall, who now lives in Cradley Heath, West Midlands, said the teenager confided in her about the relationship and admitted she had made a mistake. 'It was not a sexual relationship. It was one time. Megan came and told me what she had done and we took her to the family planning clinic,' she said . 'It happened once and she did say she felt stupid. With Megan's frame, you could tell she was 13 so there is no way that he should have got her mistaken for a 16-year-old. 'I am very very angry that the police didn't prosecute him. He knew that she was 13. 'I had a conversation with her and she said she didn't tell him she was 16. And her friend backed her up. 'She only met him because he was selling cannabis to her friend's older brother. I have never come face to face with him.' Mrs Nuttall, who has another daughter and four sons who are all older than Megan, added that she did not think the relationship was the reason for her death. 'For Megan to do something like this we were all so bewildered. There has never been anything like this in our family,' she said. 'She has got three older brothers and an older sister and me and she always confided in us. We have always been there for her. 'We used to have girly nights with crisps and pop and watch DVDs. 'There was nothing underlying, there was nothing about her say stuff was going wrong or she was fed up of anything. The 14-year-old schoolgirl  was found hanged in her bedroom,  with notes suggesting people were 'after her' 'Her personality was so bubbly. It was an accident. I think it was a cry for help, maybe she wanted some attention and it went too far. 'We still think about her every day, I cry for her every single day. I know my day will come when I can be with her again and I will be happy.' Megan had been expelled from school seven months before her death and was at a pupil referral unit. She said since moving to the unit she had changed a lot and the night before her death had run away to Manchester with another girl from the unit. Mrs Nuttall said after her death Megan had left notes suggesting that people were 'causing her trouble'. 'Megan was not being bullied. Coming from a family of older brothers and sisters and me being a single-parent mum, she was a strong personality and we were close and tight-knit,' she said. Detective Inspector Michael Spellman, from West Bromwich police's public protection unit, said the notes found in her bedroom suggested that 'people were after her', but no-one could shed any light on who these people were. Inquiries revealed that Megan had visited a family planning clinic and confided in staff about the under-age relationship, but had refused to involve police. The man was eventually traced and interviewed, telling police that Megan  told him she was 16. They started a sexual relationship, but the man, who was 23 at the time, received an anonymous phone call telling him she was 13, so he ended it, the hearing was told. A West Midlands Police spokesperson said: 'We arrested a 24-year-old man on suspicion of sexual activity with a child on 16 July last year. No further action was taken against him.' Black Country Coroner Robin Balmain recorded a narrative conclusion that Megan hanged herself and her motives and intentions were not clear. Speaking after the inquest, Mrs Nuttall said she thought Megan's death was an accident.","Megan Edmunds had allegedly told older man she was 16 years old .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Dr Rory Fox, headteacher at Ryde Academy on the Isle of Wight, defended the school's uniform policy and said it helped behaviour issues in classes . The headteacher of a secondary school where more than 250 girls were taken out of lessons because their skirts were too short has defended the ‘uniform crackdown’. Dr Rory Fox, headteacher at Ryde Academy on the Isle of Wight, said the school’s uniform policy was being enforced as a matter of fairness in a letter sent to parents today. The school, which has around 1,120 pupils, wrote to parents on June 9 to inform them it would be clamping down on 'inappropriate' clothing and said those who continued to breach the uniform policy would be sent home to change. As part of the crackdown, girls - aged between 11 and 18 - whose skirts were deemed too short, were either sent home yesterday or placed in an isolated hall. Others were also sent home to change because their trousers were ‘too tight’ and did not fit with the school’s strict new policy. And boys were also reportedly turned away after arriving at lessons with non-leather shoes. Dr Fox today defended the decision to send pupils home and claimed several girls were under peer pressure to wear inappropriate uniform. He said: ‘We are preparing students for the world of work so it is important that we teach students about the importance of managing their appearance and working to a dress code. ‘Dealing with uniform issues helps us to improve general attitudes of co-operation and the skills of following instructions. ‘This helps us to improve behaviour and learning in classrooms. ‘A significant number of teachers have already commented on how much better behaviour in lessons has become, as soon as we started dealing with uniform issues.’ ‘We would normally deal with uniform issues at the beginning of September. ‘However, we have a number of female students who have recently said that they are coming under peer pressure to wear their skirts shorter than they feel comfortable. ‘It is not fair that girls should be made to feel uncomfortable when they are just following the uniform policy. ‘We have therefore decided to act at this point in time, to correct uniform issues.’ He said the school had issued uniform . guidance to parents on several occasions during the year and that there . was a gallery of photos on the academy’s website showing the . interpretation of uniform rules. Jade Smith, 14, was sent home from Ryde Academy twice in one day. Once because her skirt was too short and again when her trousers were deemed 'too tight'. Her mother Helen, 39, said: 'It was an absolute joke' Dr . Fox said he had written to parents on June 9 warning them that there . would be a focus on uniform yesterday and teachers would ‘send students . home, or educate them apart, if their uniform was not right’. The headteacher said the current uniform policy had been in place for three years and that the school would only send home older pupils who were told to change and return to the school as quickly as possible. He said other pupils wearing inappropriate uniform would be educated away from the mainstream academy but that if the numbers swelled to more than 30 they would be sat in the hall and work under exam conditions. He said: ‘We have received a number of phone calls and requests for meetings over the last few days. ‘We will be aiming to get back to parents over the next few days, but I hope that my summary of matters here provides useful interim information.’ Helen Smith, from Ryde, Isle of Wight, said her 14-year-old daughter Jade had been sent home twice on the same day, for having a skirt that was too short and then trousers that were too tight. The 39-year-old mother-of-two said: ‘It was an absolute joke. It has been a nightmare. ‘I just can’t understand why the school have decided to do it five weeks before the end of the year. 'The school had an inset day on Monday and we spent the whole day trying to find a new skirt. 'I finally bought one for eight pounds and thought it would be perfect - it was knee length. 'But when she went to school she was immediately sent home because they said her skirt was too short. 'It was the perfect size, it was not ""too short"" - I would not have bought it otherwise. 'Jade . is so little, she is so skinny, bless her, and it was a perfect fit, we . were all really happy and sure it would pass their new strict policy. 'But when she phoned me at 8am, I couldn't believe it.' Aimee Smith (pictured left with mother Sara and father Sean) was sent home for wearing the wrong trousers, while Jake Scrimshaw, 13, (pictured right with his mother Sarah) was told off for having non-leather shoes . The single mother, who works as a waitress in a pub in Portsmouth, Hampshire, said she was forced to go down to the school after being told her daughter was to be sent home. She said: 'I rushed down to pick her up and was told she was being sent home because her skirt was too short. 'I then took her into Ryde to buy some trousers which cost another £15. 'But when she went back to school she was told they were ""too tight"" and they sent her home - again. 'Around 200 children in Year 7 and Year 8 were sent to the assembly hall for the whole day for ""isolation"" and did not have any lessons. 'Another 100 children in Year 9 and Year 10 were sent home, including some boys because their shoes were not leather. 'That means 300 children have been sent home which is ridiculous. I can't believe their education is suffering because of this. 'A number of girls do wear short skirts to school so I understand why the school had to make a change. 'But this is not the way to do it - too many people have suffered because of this.' Dr Rory Fox, headteacher at Ryde Academy on the Isle of Wight, said the school's uniform policy was being enforced as a matter of fairness and said some girls felt peer pressured into wearing shorter skirts . However, Dr Fox said the academy has 'high expectations' of its students. He said: 'We are grateful to the very many parents who support us on a day to day basis by ensuring that their children arrive at the Academy in the agreed uniform, and help to uphold the standards of dress/uniform that Ryde Academy expects. 'The governors and staff are conscious that we are preparing students for the world of work and so it is important that our students understand the importance of managing their appearance and working within the framework of a dress code.' It is not the first time Dr Fox’s strict rules on school uniform have hit the headlines. In September 2011, as headmaster of Basildon Academy in Essex, he sent home 109 pupils on the first day of his new job for wearing the wrong uniform. He sent scores of pupils home, or gave them after-school detention, for wearing trainers with Velcro, the wrong trousers, an unsuitable school bag and, in one case, a gold hairband, as well as for failing to bring a pencil, paper, rubber and ruler with them to class, while dozens were put in an isolation centre for disrupting lessons.","Pupils were sent home for breaking school uniform policy at Ryde Academy .

Going up in price: Cinnamon Twists and Cheesy Roll-ups used to cost 89 cents but is going up more than 10% . New addition: Beefy fritos. The move comes at a time when other big players in fast food, notably McDonald’s and Wendy’s, have been shifting away from dollar menus toward more value-oriented pricing . 'Consumers loved getting their own variety of dollar menu items to create their own unique meals,' said Stephanie Perdue, vice president of brand marketing. As the price rises at other chains, Taco Bell wants to stand out by staying low. 'What we heard from customers is that they’re looking to get the most for their dollar,' said Perdue. And having $1 items - no matter how few - remains important. Other options on Taco Bell’s new Dollar Cravings menu include the Shredded Chicken Mini Quesadilla, Beefy Fritos Burrito, Spicy Tostada, Cheesy Bean and Rice Burrito, and Triple Layer Nachos. The $1 price point could be a compelling and tempting alternative to options like the McDonald’s Jalapeno Double. Overall, Taco Bell has always been historically cheap with offers like burritos for 59¢ and 79¢. The $1.00 menu could mean that some customers might actually end up paying more as they buy more of the 'cheaper' options.","One Dollar Menu includes 11 items including some new choices .

"By . Lydia Warren for MailOnline . Seven teenagers wandered into the home of former Miami Heat star Ray Allen early on Thursday simply because they wanted to see where he lived, police have said. The friends, aged 18 and 19, were at a party next door to the basketball player's home in Coral Gables, Florida on Wednesday night and decided to look around the house at 2.30am on Thursday. They walked through an unlocked door and into the $11 million home - later insisting that they did not think anyone was living at the home because Allen no longer plays for the Florida team. Scroll down for video . Break in: Seven teenagers walked into this Coral Gables, Florida home owned by Ray Allen on Thursday morning because they thought it would be 'cool' to see where he lived, police said . But Allen's wife, Shannon Walker Allen, and their children were asleep upstairs. Mrs Allen heard the teens enter the home, police spokeswoman Kelly Denham told the Miami Herald. 'She heard people walking up the stairs . and that's when she yelled out to them, ""What are you doing in my . house?""' Denham said. 'As soon as they heard that, they fled the house.' The teenagers told some parents what had happened, and the adults drove them to the police station to report the incident. Denham said that the teenagers admitted they had been inside the home. 'They were there to see where Ray Allen had lived,' she said. 'They honestly thought that he had moved from the house.' Concerns: Allen, who is a free agent who has played with the Miami Heat for the past two years (left), was not at home but his wife Shannon, pictured together right, heard the intruders and yelled out to them . Dad: Allen, pictured with one of his sons in May, was away but his children were sleeping inside the home . She explained that the teenagers saw boxes inside the home and thought that Allen had moved out because he no longer plays for the Heat. The sportsman has played for the team for two years but is a free agent and has not yet revealed whether or not he will play for another year. Dunham said that officers questioned the teens but released them because there was no forced entry, no intent and nothing was taken. But she added that Allen's wife intends to file trespassing charges - and that the youngsters were well aware of what they had done. Scene: After walking into the family's $11 million house (pictured), the teenagers ran away and reported to police what had happened. They do not face any charges . 'They were crying,' she told NBC. 'They were terrified.' Earlier this year, the South Florida Business Journal reported that the athlete had bought the 11,533-square-foot mansion for $11 million. The 10-bedroom home also has a private beach, a library, marble and wood flooring, an elevator, an exercise room, a sauna and a spa bath, the paper reported.

"By . Associated Press . Two teenage boys were arrested Monday after making specific plans to kill three staffers then gun down as many students as possible at their Southern California high school, police said. The boys, who did not yet have weapons but were trying to get them, had been under constant surveillance since the school district informed police of their plans last Thursday, South Pasadena police Sgt. Brian Solinsky said. He would not elaborate on the plans or what form they took, but Solinsky said they were 'very specific' and included named targets. Scroll down for video . Busted: Police in the Los Angeles suburb of South Pasadena said on Monday they had thwarted a mass shooting plot with the arrest of two teenagers who were conspiring to kill several staffers and as many fellow students as possible at their high school . 'This is a prime example of school officials recognizing suspicious behavior,' Solinsky said in a statement. 'It was this information that helped prevent a horrific tragedy.' Police found evidence that the boys were researching rifles, submachine guns, bombs and other explosives, especially propane, police said. 'It was very viable, what they were plotting. They were making a huge plan of a school massacre that identified three staff members at the school by name that they were targeting,' Police Chief Miller said. 'They just wanted to kill as many people as possible,' he added at a morning news conference . 'They were researching weapons and how to fire and assemble them,' police Sgt. Robert Bartl told the Pasadena Star-News. Arthur Miller, Chief of Police for South Pasadena, California, described the plot as 'very viable' at a news conference. The teens were arrested at their homes days before the school year was set to start . Enough evidence was gathered to serve warrants at the boys' homes Monday, Solinsky said. One of them resisted, and police had to break into his house to take him into custody as he tried to run, Solinsky said. The boys were both about to begin their senior year at South Pasadena High School in the community of about 25,000 people eight miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles. The school's first day of classes is scheduled for Thursday, and police had hoped to make the arrests before then, though they found no evidence of a date for a planned attack, Bartl told the Star-News. Detectives had been working around the clock and monitoring the boys since the threat first emerged, . Solinsky said. Relatives of both boys had been questioned, he said, but would not elaborate further on the investigation or the evidence. The police chief plans a news conference Tuesday morning to reveal more details. The arrests came the day after another Los Angeles County boy was arrested on suspicion of posting online threats to shoot students at local schools, though sheriff's officials acknowledged that those threats were intended as pranks.","The boy, 16 and 17, were arrested at their homes and haven't been named .

"By . Richard Shears In Bali for MailOnline . and Lydia Warren for MailOnline . The daughter of an American tourist whose body was found stuffed into a suitcase at a luxury resort in Bali has been charged with her murder - and could face death by firing squad. Under Indonesian law, Heather Lois Mack, 19, and her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, 21, could face the grisly end for the killing of Sheila von Wiese-Mack. Both were charged on Friday. 'We have a great deal of evidence that, . piece by piece, builds up to a picture that points very strongly to . their guilt,' Chief Inspector General Albertus Mokalu said. The body of Von Wiese Mack, 62, from Oak Park, . Illinois, was found half naked inside a suitcase that had . been wrapped in a garbage bag and put into a taxi outside the family's hotel on Tuesday. Hiding: Heather Mack covers her face as she is led to a hospital for a medical check by Indonesian police officers on Friday. It has emerged that she and her boyfriend could face the death penalty by firing squad . Shy: Her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer also covers his face as he is led to a medical appointment on Friday . Mack . appeared panicked as the suitcase was placed in the car and told the . driver that she was going to get her mother, witnesses . said. But . when the couple left and did not return for two hours, the taxi driver . called police and the blood-marked suitcase was recovered from outside . the high-end St Regis Hotel in Denpasar. Chief Inspector General Mokalu said the couple were charged after evidence began to mount up against them. Among the evidence, surveillance footage showed Mack and her boyfriend arguing with her mother in . the hotel lobby, while more security footage showed them all entering . the room where Mrs Mack was allegedly bludgeoned to death. He . added that other evidence included fingerprints on the silver suitcase . in which her body was found and the fact that the couple had fled out . through the rear part of the hotel after depositing the suitcase in a . waiting taxi. Police . allege the pair had also used Mrs Mack’s credit card to pay for their . room at the Risata Bali resort and spa, a short distance from the . airport, where they were arrested on Wednesday. Accused: The couple are accused of killing Mack's 62-year-old mother and putting her body in a suitcase . Victim: Sheila von Wiese-Mack, pictured right with her daughter, was a wealthy academic from Chicago . The . pair told investigators that von Wiese-Mack was killed by robbers while . they managed to escape, the police chief for Bali's provincial capital . of Denpasar, Col. Djoko Hari Utomo said. But Utomo said that account contradicted testimonies by the taxi driver and hotel employees. Before . she was charged, Mack's Chicago-based lawyer, Michael Elkin, said the . claims made about his client were untrue and that she was 'hysterical' when they spoke. Elkin said he had met her a few times in Chicago and when she realized she needed an attorney she called him in tears. He said she sounded 'numb' when she called his office before her arrest. 'It appeared to me that she was trying to keep it together,' Elkin told a Chicago NBC affiliate. 'She needed assistance in getting to the embassy and how to go about it.' Aldina Kahari, an associate in Elkin's office said when she spoke to Heather in Indonesia police had refused to leave the room despite her requests. Getaway: Heather Mack (left), 19, and Tommy Schaefer, 21 (right), are seen in shots from two videos recorded inside the Conrad Hotel in Chicago last month during their stay unwittingly funded by her mother . 'During my . brief conversation with Heather, I was made aware that a police guard . was present in the room, even after I requested that I be able to speak . to Heather without anyone being present,' Kahari said in a statement. Kahari said Heather had initially been denied access to an attorney which she called 'quite disconcerting'. Elkin said he is not representing Tommy Scahefer. The police say they are looking to upgrade the charges to premeditated murder. 'Why premeditated? Because the victim was stuffed into a bag. It shows planning,' police chief Benny Mokalu told Fairfax Media. It . has also emerged that Mack told police she was pregnant and she was . seen being taken to the obstetrics and gynecology section of a police . hospital in Bali for tests on Friday, News Corp reported. 'Uncooperative': Heather Mack is pictured at the police district headquarters on Thursday . Both Mack and Schaefer are also undergoing psychological and other tests, police said. Witnesses told police that Mrs von Weise-Mack, her daughter and Schaefer had a fight at the reception desk of St Regis Hotel before her body was taken from the hotel in the silver case. Staff have told police the trio argued about who should pay the bill when they were due to check-out. According . to a staff reconstruction of the argument, Mrs von Weise-Mack was seen . telling her daughter: 'I've paid for his flight here, so the two of you . should pay for the hotel.' Von . Wiese-Mack's body was being autopsied at a hospital in Denpasar. Head . of Forensics Ida Bagus Putu Alit said there were signs of violence on . the body indicating the victim fought before she died. 'We found scars on both forearms and the broken left-hand fingernail,' Alit said following an external examination. 'That indicated a resistance in a fight.' Found: An Indonesia police officer looks at a blood covered suitcase, in which the body of Sheila von Wiese Mack was found in Bali on Tuesday . After leaving the lobby area, Mack and Schaefer arrived in the reception area with a large . suitcase wrapped in a bed sheet, refusing to allow a porter to take it . out to a waiting taxi. According to reports from Bali, the suspects so far have refused to co-operate with investigators. Videos have also emerged showing the couple partying hard in the hotel, allegedly after stealing Mrs Mack's credit card. Back in the U.S., where all three lived in an upscale Chicago suburb, authorities examined records of 86 incidents in which police were called to the family's home. The calls started in 2004 and ended in June 2013, around the time the family moved out, according to village of Oak Park spokesman David Powers. The bulk of the calls were missing-person reports, and others included domestic problems and theft, but none resulted in arrests, he said. He added there were a number of emergency 911 calls made from the residence in which the caller hung up, and, as is standard procedure, the police department sent a squad car to investigate.","Heather Mack, 19, and Tommy Schaefer, 21, have been charged with murder for the killing of Sheila von Wiese Mack, 62 .

"By . Snejana Farberov For Mail online . Fallen Cindarella: Amanda Movius, pictured here in a mugshot, married a Scottish lord in 1990 and became known as Lady Bruce, but after her divorce the mother of three turned to a life of crime in the US . The rags-to-riches story of a poor girl from Alaska who became the wife of a Scottish lord has come full circle when Amanda Bruce Grimes landed behind bars in Texas earlier this year. But for the attractive, blonde mother of three who for a time was known in Scotland as Lady Bruce, the April arrest on credit card theft charges was only the latest in a long series of run-ins with the law. Amanda Bruce Grimes, nee Movius, spent six months in a Texas prison in 2010 for committing theft involving a bogus Hawaiian rental home, Sunday Telegraph reported. Not long after her release, the former wife of Scottish aristocrat Lord Bruce, heir to the earldom of Elgin, was back behind bars for stealing credit cards from people who thought they were renting a vacation rental property in Hawaii, which in reality did not exist, and using their information to rent houses for herself in Austin. According to local reports, the former Scottish lady-turned-con artist used a similar setup to defraud a California journalist and a Canadian businessman - crimes that resulted in her incarceration between December 2009 and June 2010. But repeated stints in prisons seemingly have not taught  Ms Grimes anything. The Sunday Telegraph reported that the woman who at one time was a member of Scotland’s high society was busted in Hays County, Texas, four months ago under yet another alias, Amanda Reyna, on charges of credit card fraud and theft. Immediately after bonding out of jail, the woman was arrested again on theft and fraud charges in Travis County, and thrown into the local jail where she remained until her release in June. The previous year was also a busy one for Ms Grimes, who added counts of DUI, marijuana possession and blocking traffic to her already lengthy rap sheet. Highlands elite: Charles Bruce, a descendant of King Robert the Bruce who as heir to the earldom of Elgin holds the title Lord Bruce, met and fell in love with Amanda Movius while she was vacationing in Scotland in 1989; the couple have three children together . The middle-aged, disgraced aristocrat is still wanted in Hays Country on a pair of outstanding charges of credit card fraud and identity theft. Swapping names and identities has become a habit - as well as an illicit source of income - for Grimes over the past two decades. Born Amanda Movius in the family of an Alaskan engineer and an alcoholic housewife who ended her life by drowning in a bathtub, the future con artist left Fairbanks at age 18 to go to college in Washington state. In 1989, the then 22-year-old Amanda Movius went on vacation in Scotland where she met her future husband at a party. ‘When I met Charlie, I didn't have a clue who he was,’ she told Austin American Statesman. ‘It was just a typical boy-meets-girl situation.’ Lord Bruce, a descendant of the 14th century King Robert the Bruce and one of Scotland’s most eligible bachelors, was smitten by the vivacious blonde American. Born Charles Bruce, his father is the 11th Earl of Elgin, and Lord Bruce will become the 12th. Their ancestor the Seventh Earl of Elgin took the Elgin Marbles, now found in the British Museum, from the Parthenon in Athens. A whirlwind romance in the Highlands concluded with a fairy-tale wedding a year later, the Telegraph reported. The couple settled in a 19th century, 30,000-square-foot mansion in Fife staffed with maids and cooks at Lady Amanda’s beck and call. The small-time girl from Alaska was transformed into a high-society lady, donning designer clothes worth thousands of dollars and hosting glamorous charity events. Eight years and three children later, the marriage of Lord and Lady Bruce ended over claims of infidelity on the part of the wife. Amanda left Scotland in 2000 amid allegations that she abandoned her children’s clothing store and settled her creditors with hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt - a claim she has denied. Lord Bruce was granted custody of their daughter and two sons, who are now in their early 20s. Their eldest son, James, holds the title Master of Bruce and will become 13th Earl of Elgin. The former Scottish socialite returned to the US and moved to Seattle, where in 2003 she met and married David Grimes, a local real estate developer. Spinning tales: In 2007, Amanda Grimes moved out to California, where she presented herself as a screenwriter. To bolster her credentials, she would show new acquaintances in Hollywood a photo of herself posing with actors Woody Harrelson, Keanu Reeves and Robert Downey Jr on the set of A Scanner Darkly . But her second marriage collapsed only a year later. Looking back on their brief history together, David Grimes told The Telegraph that Amanda was a ‘mystery’ to him. Not long after the breakup, Grimes was arrested for failing to pay for a hotel room in Seattle and using a stolen credit card. She pleaded guilty but skipped town before sentencing. In 2007, Amanda Grimes moved out to California, where she presented herself as a screenwriter. To bolster her credentials, she would show new acquaintances in Hollywood a photo of herself posing with actors Woody Harrelson, Keanu Reeves and Robert Downey Jr on the set of A Scanner Darkly. It was around that time, according to law enforcement officials, that the twice-divorced mother of three came upon the Hawaii vacation home scheme where she would use a PayPal account to try and rent the same fictitious property to multiple people. Working under the alias Amanda George, Grimes allegedly duped, among others, Los Angeles Times travel editor Catharine Hamm who paid the bogus rental agent $5,000 to spend her upcoming honeymoon in Hawaii. According to police in Austin, Amanda Grimes-George used the proceeds from her fraudulent dealings to rent homes for herself in the Texas state capital. Eventually, Grimes' elaborate lies caught up with her, and she pleaded guilty in 2010 to four felony counts. Speaking to the Austin American Statesman from the Woodman State Jail in Gatesville that year, the woman maintained her innocence, dismissing the numerous allegations against her as misunderstandings; she also sounded eager to turn a new leaf. ‘I'll be out in time to spend summer with my children,’ she said at the time. ‘I'm just ready to put this behind me.’","Amanda Movius was born in Fairbanks, Alaska, and married Scotland's Lord Bruce in 1990; the couple had three children .

"By . Lydia Warren for MailOnline . Taken: A sketch shows Fannie Millier, one of the abducted Amish girls. The Amish forbid photos . A desperate search is underway for two Amish girls after they were apparently abducted from their family's roadside stand in northern New York last night. Six-year-old Delila Miller and 12-year-old Fannie Miller were bundled into a white car as they went to help a customer in Oswegatchie around 7.20pm on Wednesday, according to reports. On Thursday, the St. Lawrence County Sheriff's Office released a drawing of what one of the girls, Fannie, looks like. Members of the Amish community do not allow photos of themselves, which they see as an act of pride and a violation of their religious beliefs. Kevin Wells said his office has received 'numerous leads' and that state troopers, forest rangers and U.S. Border Patrol agents were part of the search. Dive teams have also been called in to scour the nearby Oswegatchie River. 'There's no indication to take us any certain direction at this point,' Sheriff Kevin Wells told WWNY. 'We're following all leads and we're making sure we overturn every stone that we're aware of and we're moving from there.' The girls had been milking in their . family's barn on Wednesday evening when they headed to the road because . they believed a customer was at the vegetable stand, WWNY reported last night. Crime scene: New York State Police investigators search for clues at a roadside vegetable stand in Oswegatchie, New York, from where the two girls vanished on Wednesday night . Search: Officials search a field after the girls vanished; a witness said he saw a white car near their stand . An Amish witness who was passing told authorities that he saw a man put something in the back of his white four-door sedan and, when he drove off, the little girls were gone. Authorities had placed a protective covering on tire tracks on the road and were going through the register of sex offenders in the area. They said they do not have a license plate number from the car and have not identified a suspect. 'It's a scant trail,' Undersheriff Scott Bonno said. 'We don't have a lot of good leads, but you begin to utilize logic. We're going to start looking at sex offenders in the community, just to eliminate them as suspects, if nothing else.'

She is crosseyed. Both of the girls have heavy accents and speak in the Pennsylvania Dutch dialect, but the 12-year-old, Fannie, speaks English, SYR reported. Sheriff Kevin Wells added that because of the time that passed since their disappearance, the girls may be wearing different clothing or have had their hair cut.

"By . James Gordon . Lance Armstrong says he believed he is living a 'positive and free' life after confessing to using performance-enhancing drugs. The disgraced cyclist told CNN that he has been able to go about his daily life without being taunted or heckled for what he did. A cancer survivor and once hero to millions, Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France victories and banned for life from racing in 2012 by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency after it accused him in a report of engineering one of the most sophisticated doping schemes in sports. The investigation and later admission to doping destroyed Armstrong`s reputation and career. Time for reflection: Lance Armstrong is living an unbothered and positive life 18 months after confessing to using performance-enhancing drugs . 'I never get crap, not once, and I`m surprised by that,' Armstrong told CNN. 'Sure, I sometimes get the vibe that someone wants to say something but it`s never happened.' The Armstrong lies along with the bullying and the betrayal has laid him bare to all manner of abuse. The cyclist`s problems are far from over however. He and his team of lawyers are about to face several civil lawsuits that could drain the fortune gained. In June a federal judge rejected Armstrong`s bid to dismiss a whistleblower lawsuit claiming that he and his former cycling team, which the U.S. Postal Service had sponsored, defrauded the government in a scheme to use banned, performance-enhancing drugs. Armstrong claims the U.S. Postal Service benefitted hugely from the exposure it got from its sponsorship and that the lawsuit had been brought too late. Toughing it up: He admits to having an 'f-you' attitude, but the disgraced cyclist insists he 'never gets crap' from people following his long-awaited admission of long-term doping . The lawsuit has potential $100 million ramifications for a man who was previously one of the world's most bankable sports stars. 'I'm very confident that that's a winner for us,' he says. 'I don't think anyone can truly argue the U.S. Postal Service was damaged. They made a lot of money in the deal and got what they bargained for. 'I`m very confident that that`s a winner for us,' said Armstrong. 'I don`t think anyone can truly argue the U.S. Postal Service was damaged. 'They made a lot of money in the deal and got what they bargained for. 'I worked my ass off for them and I`m proud of it. Furthermore there wasn`t a technical relationship between myself and the U.S. Postal Service.' Armstrong relishes a good fight. He claims it's what made him a great cyclist. 'I definitely have a 'f-you' attitude,' he says. 'I fight in training, I fight to win races, I fight to motivate the guys in the team. Bleak outlook: There's no hope of him ever riding competitively again and he is facing civil lawsuits to the tune of tens of millions of dollars . The list of those he hurt, and who won't forgive him, is long: three-time Tour winner Greg LeMond; journalist David Walsh, who spent more than a decade trying to expose Armstrong; and former friends Frankie and Betsy Andreu, to name a few. A number have asked whether his public mea culpa on Oprah was genuine and if he needs to do more. 'That's a difficult one for me to answer,' he says. 'You can't do justice in a one-hour conversation. It was a situation for a lot of people that it was too much information, but for other people - cycling fans, sports fans, for other parts of the population - it wasn't enough, I didn't go far enough.' Armstrong says he's sorry in conversation repeatedly but, at the same time, he knows it doesn't matter to many people. 'I don't blame anyone for thinking, 'I don't trust this guy with all his b*****t for 10 years,' ' he adds. In some ways it is as if Lance Armstrong is trying to rebuild his tattered reputation and although he will never be welcomed back into cycling society,mixed with presidents or Hollywood movie stars, he claims he is still friends with many. Reboot: Armstrong hopes to restart his charity work, undergo a course of therapy andsays he is planning on writing a book where he will 'put it all out there' There even friends who stopped ringing or answering his calls but he is adamant it is not part some PR campaign. Armstrong says he has big plans for the future including rebooting his original cancer foundation, and he says he wants to write a third book which won't have anything to do with cycling. 'I need to write a book and it needs to be pretty raw. I need to put it out there and let it sit. The sooner the better. It has to be the right book, the right tone and there has to be totally no b-s.' He says that he sees writing as a kind of therapy that will help see him through the next few years. He says he is 'fully committed to putting it all out there.' If that's the case, a good many of his former fans are wondering, what don't we yet know?","The cyclist was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles in 2013 .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Last week’s emergency surveillance legislation may have sounded like something out of George Orwell’s novel 1984, but was cited as yet another real-life example of states trying to control their citizens. It’s been 65 years since Orwell described a fictional dystopian world of surveillance and manipulation by so-called Big Brother, and experts claim over the next decade this fiction is about to become fact. The Net Threats report from Pew Research Centre details how, by 2025, the web will be governed by a system heavily influenced by governments, large corporations, and security services all trying to control our behaviours. Scroll down for video . More than 1,400 experts were surveyed for The Net Threats report by the Pew Research Centre. The report details how, by 2025, the web will be governed by a system heavily influenced by governments, large corporations, and security services (stock image pictured) This could mean what we buy, read, watch and share will be restricted, and our surfing history stored for future use. More than 1,400 experts, including analysts, editors and professors, were canvassed for their opinion. The Pew Centre report discovered four major threats facing the web: . Actions by nation-states to maintain . security and political control will lead to more blocking, filtering and . segmentation of the internet. Trust . will be weakened, as a result of revelations about government and . corporate surveillance - and will likely increase surveillance in the . future. Commercial . pressures and influences will affect the flow of information, and make . the web less open - a threat campaigners for net neutrality already fear . following debates about internet fast lanes. Efforts to fix the TMI (too much information) problem might over-compensate and actually thwart content sharing. According to their responses, they believe actions by nation-states to maintain security and political control will lead to more blocking, filtering and segmentation of the internet. Trust will be weakened, as a result of revelations about government and corporate surveillance - and this will likely increase surveillance in the future. And commercial pressures will affect the flow of information, and make the web less open - a threat campaigners for net neutrality already fear following debates over internet fast lanes. Paul Saffo, managing director at Discern Analytics and consulting associate professor at Stanford University, said that by 2025 'the pressures to balkanise the global internet will continue and create new uncertainties. 'Governments will become more skilled at blocking access to unwelcome sites.’ Dave Burstein, editor of Fast Net News, added: ‘Governments worldwide are looking for more power over the net, especially within their own countries. ‘Britain, for example, has just determined that ISPs block sites the government considers ‘terrorist’ or otherwise dangerous. In 1984, Winston Smith is told to control the flow of opinion using the government's language Newspeak (still from the 1984 Michael Radford film adaption is pictured). Experts feel this is already happening, in places such as North Korea, and predict that, by 2025, it will become more common place, and spread across the west too . 'This will grow. There will usually be ways to circumvent the obstruction, but most people won’t bother.’ The main criticism of such plans, and the main issue surrounding the data obtained, is its impact on privacy. Raymond Plzak, from The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, said: ‘The inconsistent protection of privacy, whether private information is voluntarily provided or not, as well as the inconsistent protection against exploitation will continue to be the bane of connected environment.’ NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden (pictured) has condemned the UK's plans for an emergency surveillance bill, in what he described 'as increased powers of intrusion' He continued that if local, regional, national and international private and public sector companies fail to join forces and accept a universal way of handling these privacy issues, sharing data and being connected will become more limited by 2025. This will also have an impact on preventing content being shared around the world. In 1984, character Winston Smith is told to edit reports and control the flow of opinion using the government's language Newspeak, and experts feel this is already happening, in places such as North Korea. And they predict that, by 2025, this will become more common place, and widespread across the West too. ‘The increased Balkanisation of the internet is a possible outcome of the [Edward] Snowden revelations, as people seek to develop systems that are less accessible by the NSA, GCHQ and so on,’ said Professor Kate Crawford, a research scientist at the MIT Center for Civic Media. ‘Meanwhile, the dominant content companies may seek ever more rigorous ways to prevent the flow of copyright content within and across borders.’ NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden recently condemned the UK's plans for an emergency surveillance bill, voicing concerns about the lack of public debate, fear-mongering and what he described 'as increased powers of intrusion'. Earlier this year, the Federal Communications Commission in the U.S pushed forward with plans to let internet service providers charge content companies for faster and more reliable delivery of their traffic to users. The controversial 'fast lane' rules received heavy criticism from many companies that do business online, along with open internet advocates. Under the plans for priority usage, Netflix for example, could pay extra to use fast lanes to get the maximum amount of bandwith to its customers. Earlier this year, the Federal Communications Commission pushed forward with plans to let internet service providers charge content companies, such as Netflix (pictured), for faster delivery of their traffic to users. The Pew report said such commercialisation of the internet is the biggest challenge to its growth by 2025 . At the heart of net neutrality is an open internet in which all data being sent from websites to customers is treated the same, regardless of size or destination. All this traffic is given the same priority along the same lanes and no site is given preferential treatment.

Although it seems like a fair model, in which sites that use the most bandwith pay the most money, campaigners claim it will drastically impact on industry competition. Experts, including Glenn Edens, director of research in networking, security, and distributed systems at PARC said: ‘Network operators’ desire to monetise their assets to the detriment of progress represents the biggest potential problem.' A post-doctoral researcher, who was not named in the report, continued: ‘We are seeing an increase in walled gardens created by giants like Facebook and Apple. 'Commercialisation of the internet, paradoxically, is the biggest challenge to the growth of the Internet. Communication networks’ lobbying against net neutrality is the biggest example of this.’ Earlier today, the Internet . Association wrote to the Federal Communications Commission claiming that broadband providers could turn the internet into 'a . pay-for-priority platform more closely resembling cable television than . today's onternet.' The . group, which represents Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon, and others, urged the Commission to protect its open and neutral . architecture, which is the force behind the internet's success. PJ Rey, a PhD candidate in sociology at the University of Maryland, added that by 2025: ‘It is very possible we will see the principle of net neutrality undermined. ‘In a political paradigm where money equals political speech so much hinges on how much ISPs and content providers are willing and able to spend on defending their competing interests. 'Unfortunately, the interests of everyday users count for very little.’ While a former chair of an IETF working group concluded : 'Corporate influence on the political process will largely eliminate the public’s freedom to do as they please on the internet. 'I would like to see the internet come to be regarded as a public utility, as broadcast spectrum was, but I think the concentration of power is too extreme for that degree of freedom to happen.'","More than 1,400 experts, including analysts and professors were surveyed .

"By . James Gordon . A couple from Florida who believed they met each other at university found that their paths crossed years earlier when they were both children at pre-school. Jason and Jessica Roth, 35, from Miami thought a nightclub near Florida State University was the place they should note as the place where true love struck, but they actually met each other 17 years earlier at a costume party. Jason, in a Superman outfit, together with his future wife, Jessica, in a pink and burgundy genie costume, were pictured together at their preschool Halloween parade. Familiar face? Jason and Jessica Roth are coming up on their 10 year anniversary, but an old photo revealed that they actually met much, much earlier - in preschool . Save the date: Wedding bells could have been in the air as long as 17 years before they finally got together... They were shocked when they discovered that, though they're from different towns, they had a picture together from 17 years before they 'met' The couple only found out about their previous encounter 18 months into their relationship. They always knew that they had attended the same preschool for a brief period of time when Jason lived in the town of Lakeland with his aunt. However, they did not realize that they ended up participating in the same events as one another. The pair have no memory of each other as kids but after finding an old photo taken at his preschool's Halloween parade, Jason spotted a little girl dressed in pink. 'I vaguely remembered having a photo . from that period of time,' Jason said. He rummaged through old photos, . and came across a single photo from Halloween during his time in . Lakeland. He spotted a little blonde girl that looked a whole lot like . his then-girlfriend. 'I was sitting at work and he called me and . said, ‘Hey, I found this picture. When you were in preschool, what was . your Halloween costume?' The 35-year-olds met at a club near Florida State University, their alma mater, and started dating when Jason was a senior at FSU, but they actually 'met' when they were both much younger . She said she was a genie, which matched the girl in the photo. 'I sat there looking at the wall thinking ‘This is incredible.’' 'Never did I think she’d be the girl standing two feet from me,' Jason added. He’s hesitant to call it 'destiny,' but rather 'pretty phenomenal happenstance.' 'We were always kind of in each other’s orbits, we were just waiting for the stars to align.' Jason said. 'Very rarely in life do you see how all pieces fall into places to make things happen.' 'It was a pretty amazing revelation that despite me spending a majority of my childhood in Miami, we managed to go to preschool together,' Jason told The Huffington Post. The couple also found out that they lived in the same dorm freshman at Florida State University and that he even server her beignets at the cafe he used to work in. About a year after discovering the picture, the couple got engaged. They even used the incredible flashback photo as their 'Save the Date' wedding announcement. The couple have now been together a decade and will celebrate their 10th anniversary in April. Whether it be divine intervention or just plain good luck, Jason believes the picture is proof that they are meant to be together. 'Life is hard and sometimes our orbits get further apart, but then they come back together and I couldn't be more grateful to have such a wonderful partner in life,' he said.

"By . Lizzie Parry for MailOnline . A mother desperate to discover why her daughter was not growing found out she was suffering an extremely rare form of dwarfism after researching her symptoms online. Georgina Horton-Jones, 35, became concerned when her daughter Isabella failed to grow as fast as she should. Despite doctors' assurances that the newborn was in no danger and would catch up eventually, Ms Horton-Jones turned to 'Dr Google' for answers. While researching Isabella's symptoms the trainee bereavement counsellor, from Haverfordwest, stumbled across pictures of children with Russell-Silver syndrome. Scroll down for video . Six-year-old Isabella Horton-Jones was diagnosed with the extremely rare Russell-Silver syndrome after her mother Georgina researched her symptoms online . Isabella's mother became concerned when her daughter, pictured at 10 months left and now, right, failed to grow as expected. Despite doctors' assurances that her daughter was in no danger, Ms Horton-Jones turned to 'Dr Google' for answers . After consulting a charity, Isabella was referred to a private hospital, where a geneticist confirmed she was one of around one in 50,000 people who have the rare form of dwarfism. Ms Horton-Jones said: 'It was daunting to realise just how rare the condition was - and how few specialists there were in the world who were capable of advising us on it, but to realise what we were facing lifted a weight off my shoulders. 'I knew that something wasn’t right, and to have that eventually confirmed felt like a vindication.' Ms Horton-Jones’s pregnancy with Isabella was relatively straightforward until her unborn daughter stopped growing at 28 weeks. She said: 'Between 28 and 30 weeks her weight didn’t change from 5lb. 'I was terrified, but a scan confirmed that her circulation was fine, so that put me at ease. We agreed that I would be induced at 38 weeks.' Ms Horton-Jones attended hospital as instructed by despite being induced, she did not go into labour as planned. As the days wore on, doctors informed Ms Horton-Jones that she would need an emergency cesarean section. Isabella was delivered on May 25, 2008. Ms Horton-Jones, who is also mother to . Cameron, now 17, Catryn, 12, and Caitlyn, 10, said: 'Isabella didn’t cry . when she came out. After a while she let out a little yelp, but that . was that. Isabella pictured centre with her sisters Catryn, 12, left and Caitlyn, 10. After her mother's internet research she was referred to a private hospital. Genetic tests confirmed she had the condition, which affects around one in 50,000 births . 'When I saw her wrapped up on the neo-natal ward, I thought she was the tiniest thing I’d ever seen. I wanted to feed her, but if I’d had held her to my breast, I would have smothered her. 'It was very concerning, but again I was told that there was nothing to worry about - that all of her scans had come back as normal, and she would develop in her own time.' But in the following months, Isabella did not grow as quickly as her mother expected. Ms Horton-Jones said: 'I tried to find a babygro for her, but even the smallest ones didn’t fit. 'I noticed that I wasn’t having to buy bigger clothes for her as the months went by. If it had been my first child, I wouldn’t have worried, but because I’d had children, I knew in my heart that something wasn’t quite right.' 'I tried to find a babygro for her, but even the smallest ones didn't fit' - Georgina Horton-Jones . She began attending appointments with a paediatrician at Withybush General Hospital every six months. Isabella, now six, could not sit up until she was 10 months old and it was another three years before she started talking. After she expressed concerns to the pediatrician, Ms Horton-Jones was told that Isabella could have Stickler syndrome, a hereditary condition which affects growth. She said: 'I immediately went home and looked the condition up. None of the symptoms matched. I was certain that she didn’t have it. 'But as I was searching around I found a picture of a little boy with Russell-Silver syndrome. I immediately thought, ""that’s Izzy"". 'I showed the picture to my mother and she asked when I had taken it. She thought it was Isabella, they looked so similar - the big forehead, the low-set ears, the triangular face.' Ms Horton-Jones, said: 'I felt a huge weight lift off my shoulders. I had been right to have been so determined. Now my focus could be about the future - how I could plan and arrange things to make things easier for Isabella, who we knew would have the condition for life' Ms Horton-Jones took her suspicions to an endocrinologist at the University of Wales Hospital in Cardiff, but after deliberation, medical opinion was divided. She said: 'Five doctors agreed my daughter had Russell-Silver syndrome, and five did not. I was becoming worried. 'Isabella was due to start school and I still didn’t know what we faced. 'She looked so small compared to the others in her class. I didn’t want her to get injured in boisterous play. 'I wanted to know exactly what challenges Isabella was facing, and how I might be able to help her.' She contacted the charity the Child Growth Foundation, who recommended a specialist at London’s private Portland Hospital - one of only three specialists in Russell-Silver worldwide. Russell-Silver syndrome is very rare, affecting around one in 50,000 births. Little is known about what causes the growth condition. In most families, only one child has the condition, but occasionally more than one affected child is born into the family. It may suggest a genetic basis for the condition, prompting scientists to research the link. Symptoms of the condition include: . puberty can begin early . Source:Child Growth Foundation . She said: 'The doctor at the private . hospital took careful measurements and reviewed pictures of Isabella as . she had grown up. He then referred us to a geneticist. 'Around a third of patients with Russell-Silver are diagnosed through genetic testing. 'Sure enough, signs in her chromosomes confirmed that she had Russell-Silver. 'I . felt a huge weight lift off my shoulders. I had been right to have been . so determined. Now my focus could be about the future - how I could . plan and arrange things to make things easier for Isabella, who we knew . would have the condition for life.' Ms Horton-Jones has fitted out her home with equipment, such as ramps and booster seats, to make life for her daughter easier. She said: 'There are two other children in Wales which we know who have it. 'It affects growth, speech, mobility. She can’t run or jump. It’s difficult to get her to feed, and she can only eat certain things because she can’t chew. 'Other than that, she’s normal. She just smaller. 'Russell-Silver is not a life-limiting condition. Adults with the syndrome live full lives - they drive and have jobs. 'She’ll only get to about 4ft 6in at her tallest, but she’s now on a growth hormone. Last year she grew 11cm - 6cm more than in previous years.' Ms Horton-Jones has now become an enthusiastic supporter and fundraiser for the Child Growth Foundation, the charity which supported her in her efforts to get a positive diagnosis. Earlier this year, she braved a fear of heights to take part in a skydive. She said: 'The Child Growth Foundation have been wonderful with me. They’ve connected us with other families and it’s nice for Izzy to know there are other children like her. She loves going to conventions and interacting with them. 'Every day we tell her she’s special. 'She’s very cheeky, but she’s as good as gold. She tidies up when I ask her to and she doesn’t like shouting and noise. Her brother and sisters are protective over her. 'She has the most infectious laugh I’ve ever heard, and she lights up any room she’s in.

Terry Gallop prepares a pint containing lager, tomato ketchup, Worcestershire sauce and two fish . He was dared to down the pint, which included two guppy fish, by his friends to celebrate his 29th birthday . Gallop, a father-of-three, downed the cocktail - . including two guppy fish - in one gulp. Prior to the challenge, he had drunk four cans of lager. His friend, Jason Williams, 28, from Westbury, filmed the challenge on his camera. Gallop, wearing a black Adidas Originals hoodie, can be seen stirring the murky black mix with a spoon in the video. He then adds two guppy fish - also known as 'rainbow fish' - to the pint. A . group of friends can be heard chuckling as Gallop grins, while he . swills the drink. He then lifts the glass up while looking at the . camera, before downing the drink in 13 seconds. The 29-year-old then wipes his mouth with his sleeve to a chorus of laughs in a kitchen on February 3 this year. He filled the pint glass with the mixture, topped off with vinegar, mint sauce, soy sauce, Jack Daniels and Coke . Gallop took 13 seconds to down the murky black pint for a Neknomination video that was filmed and put online . 'Neknomination' is a drinking game in which people post videos of themselves on . Facebook and other social media sites drinking dangerous and bizarre . concoctions of alcohol and then dare their friends to outdo them. The . game has claimed three British lives and sent many others to hospital. Gallop . admitted one charge under section 9 of the Animal Welfare Act at . Salisbury Magistrates' Court, brought against him by the Royal Society . for the Protection of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) after the video was . spotted by a pet shop worker. But speaking out after his court case, he . said his actions were nothing compared to what celebrities did on the . television show 'I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!' Gallop, wearing a black Adidas Originals hoodie, was filmed by his friend Jason Williams, 28, for the prank . He was fined £818 after admitting one charge under section 9 of the Animal Welfare Act, brought against him by the RSPCA . The NekNominate craze is thought to have originated in Perth, Australia, but thanks to social media it has since gone global. The hashtag 'neknominate' started trending in the UK in January 2013. The concept of the game has been described by a user on Facebook as: 'Neck your drink. Nominate another. Don't break the chain, don't be a d**k. The social drinking game for social media! #neknominate. Drink Responsible'. The stunt is filmed then posted on the internet. One extreme example featured a woman riding a horse into a supermarket and downing a can of Pepsi. The game has claimed three British lives and sent many others to hospital. The married father-of-three said: 'People eat animals on ""I'm a Celebrity"" all of the time. 'What I did is not as bad as what they do on I'm a Celebrity.' He added: 'I didn't even know it was illegal and it was only two tiny, little fish. 'It was something that happened after a few drinks and it was just one of those things, but I do regret doing it now. 'I couldn't taste the fish and the whole drink tasted horrible - it had mint sauce in it and tasted like a lumpy milkshake.' He continued: 'I was sick five minutes later in Jason's BMW. 'He wasn't pleased but we've been best friends since we were seven years old.' His friend Williams admitted one offence under section 44 of the Magistrates' Court Act 1980 'of aiding and abetting' his friend. He was given a £988 fine for his part in the challenge. Williams, a gas repair company owner, said: 'I do regret what happened and I regret having to go to court as I got a £900 fine. 'What we did was wrong, but it was just a drunken thing. 'Where we live - in the country - if you see a spider in the house and you kill it, it is not considered a bad thing.' The pair were also banned from keeping fish for two years at Salisbury Magistrates' Court yesterday. RSPCA inspector Miranda Albinson said: 'These gentlemen may have been in high spirits as part of the birthday celebrations, but it is quite clearly not acceptable behaviour when it is detrimental to an animal's welfare. 'Hopefully this case sends out a clear message from the courts that such behaviour will not be tolerated.'","Terry Gallop, 29, has been fined for downing a cocktail including two fish .

Marcus Kalani Watson and Rogussia Eddie Allen Danielson from Hawaii posted pictures of themselves holding thick wads of cash just days after they're accused of commuting armed robbery, police say. Watson, 19, who goes by the name Kiki Seui, was indicted by the FBI as the 'mastermind' of the series of armed robberies targeting Oahu banks and a recycling center.

Rogussia Eddie Allen Danielson who goes by Eddie Danielson, posted himself on Facebook June 12 with cash he allegedly stole during bank robberies, an FBI affidavit said . However, Watson posted a picture himself holding two thick wads of cash and made it his cover photo on Facebook, two days after his first alleged armed robbery at a recycling center in April. According to an affidavit, wearing a black ski mask and brown hooded jacket, Watson brandished a black semi automatic pistol, and pointed a gun at both employees. Scared for their lives, or at the very least getting injured, the employees handed over more than $500 in cash. The following month, Watson allegedly robbed the Wahiawa branch of American Savings Bank walking away with nearly $7,000. Kalani Watson aka Kiki Seui was indicted by the FBI as the mastermind of a series of armed robberies in which he targeted Oahu banks and a recycling center . Police say the men went on a crime spree in April and May. Surveillance pictures showed the heavily armed, masked men terrorizing bank tellers while stealing tens of thousands of dollars . He is then accused of boarding a city bus and watching as the police sped to the scene. He then apparently spent the money on a Lexus and root canal. Less than two weeks later, Watson got together with Danielson, 19, to allegedly rob another American Savings Bank. They allegedly entered wearing masks and holding a shot gun. This time it is alleged they got away with almost $22,000. Both the crooks posted photos of themselves on Facebook, fanning out the cash they stole. By the end of the month, the pair had  recruited a third member to their team, 18-year-old AJ Williander, and decided to rob another branch of the American Savings Bank, making off with $11,500, police say. Honolulu police then brought in the FBI. An informant gave police further information apparently because he was concerned about Watson's violent talk. Able to pinpoint their suspect, the FBI then followed Watson as he traveled to California and back to see his family. Police and the FBI say the men in the pictures were identified through a confidential source and DNA evidence then confirmed their involvement . Honolulu Police Chief Louis Kealoha says Hawaii is safer now that these men have been caught . Unbeknownst to him, FBI agents sat beside him throughout the flight to ensure public safety. When the plane landed, the agents arrested him along with Williander who was waiting to pick up him up at the airport. The third suspect, Danielson was apprehended later at his home without incident. FBI Special Agent James Mitchell of the Criminal Enterprise Squad said a confidential informant as well as witnesses and public records were used to crack the case. He wrote: 'Federal law enforcement worked closely with local law enforcement to solve the case through use of technology and 'good old fashioned police work.' 'It was through the use of modern technology and some good old fashioned police work that resulted in the identification of these three perpetrators,' said U.S. Attorney Florence Nakakuni. The men are suspected of robbing a Reynolds Recycling Center in April, and then holding up three banks in May . FBI Special Agent in Charge Viva Bottom said: 'Solving these robberies was a particular priority for the FBI and the Honolulu Police Department because of the escalated level of threatened violence involved.' All three defendants could face up to 20 years in prison for each count against them. Honolulu Police Department Chief Louis Kealoha said: 'Honolulu is definitely safer now that these three suspects are in custody.'","18-year old AJ Williander, 19-year old Rogussia Eddie Allen Danielson, and 19-year old Marcus Kalani Watson could face up to 20 years in jail .

"By . Thomas Burrows for MailOnline . Cameraman Huw Walters allegedly forged his wife's signature to pay off £59,000 in debts. He denies three counts of fraud at Cardiff Crown Court . An award-winning cameraman forged his wife's signature to pay off £59,000 in debts, before divorcing her, a court heard. Huw Talfryn Walters, 50, allegedly spent the money on buying expensive camera and photographic equipment. But the court heard the freelance cameraman kept his spiralling money problems secret from his wife, Helen Bowen. The case was brought before a new jury after the original jury failed to reach a majority verdict in March this year. Cardiff Crown Court heard yesterday how Walters forged Miss Bowen's signature three times to take £59,000 from their joint mortgage on their marital home in Rhiwbina, Cardiff. During one application, he wrote: 'We need these funds urgently, so your speed in these matters would be welcome.' He then ended their 14-year marriage after telling his wife he needed to put their house up for sale. Walters allegedly told Miss Bowers: 'I'm divorcing you because if I don't I'm going to go bankrupt.' Prosecutor John Davies said: 'Miss Bowen made a career change around 2005 and after that left the mortgage and bills to her husband who she trusted. 'They separated in December 2011 and not long after that she became aware the mortgage had increased without her agreement. 'She contacted the bank to obtain copies of the three withdrawals which increased the size of the mortgage by £59,000. 'She realised the signatures on them didn't belong to her - they were written by her husband without her knowledge while they still lived together.' Freelance cameraman Walters has worked on programmes including the BBC Proms, Doctor Who and Channel 4's history show Time Team. He has won two Welsh Baftas for his cinematography and camera work in recent years. The court heard Walters spent thousands of pounds on expensive camera equipment. Mr . Davies told the jury: 'A total of £59,000 was acquired using the fake . signature of his then wife. He entered each signature having not . consulted her or asked to consent.' Scroll down for video . Cardiff Crown Court (pictured) heard how Walters forged Miss Bowen's signature three times to take £59,000 from their joint mortgage on their marital home in Rhiwbina, Cardiff . The court heard from a forensic handwriting expert, who proved Helen Bowen's signature had not been written by her - and was most likely written by her husband. Miss Bowers, a professional reflexologist, said she only discovered her husband had forged her signature a few months after their separation - when she was contacted by her mortgage provider. When asked if she agreed to the mortgage withdrawals, she replied: 'No, not at all. If I had been asked I would not have agreed to them.' Walters, now of Maesteg, in Bridgend, denies three charges of fraud. The trial continues.

"By . Daniel Piotrowski For Daily Mail Australia . and Aap . Now even Joe Hockey admits he blew it. The Treasurer this afternoon publicly apologised for suggesting the 'poorest people don't have cars or actually don't drive very far'. 'I am really genuinely very sorry that there is any suggestion, any suggestion at all, that I or that government does not care for the disadvantaged in the community,' he said in a sympathetic interview with 2GB afternoon host Ben Fordham. He decided to say sorry after a woman approached him in the street following a community event to tell him to 'show us what's in your heart'. Scroll down for video . Apology: Joe Hockey, pictured in the studio prior to his interview with 2GB's Ben Fordham. Education Minister Chris Pyne was asked six times during a television interview whether he supported Joe Hockey's controversial comments . The apology came after the Prime Minister distanced himself from Mr Hockey's comments at a press conference today. 'Plainly, I wouldn't say that,' he said. Education Minister Christopher Pyne also declined to defend Joe Hockey on breakfast television despite six opportunities to do so. Mr Hockey admitted on 2GB that the remarks were 'insensitive'. 'What was said can't be unsaid.' 'I can only apologise for any hurt that I've caused.' He said he found the backlash 'upsetting' as he had fought his whole life for the disadvantaged. In response, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten tweeted: 'It took @joehockey more than 48 hrs to realise how insulting his comments were. It took the rest of us four seconds.' Earlier, Mr Pyne was asked whether he agreed with Joe Hockey's controversial comments when he appeared on the Today show with Shadow Infrastructure Minister Anthony Albanese. Mr Pyne stated that the Treasurer had the government's 'full support' and that he wouldn't 'cop any criticism of Joe Hockey on these remarks'. But when directly asked whether he supported Mr Hockey's comments that 'poor people don't drive' he refused to answer, instead repeating that Joe Hockey was doing 'an inspirational job as Treasurer'. Mr Albanese jumped in, pointing out Mr Pyne's refusal to back Mr Hockey's comments explicitly, telling the Education Minister: 'You had six opportunities to support what he said and you refuse to do so. Why? Because what he said was rubbish.' 'If you are in an outer suburb or a regional community you have no choice but to drive and this is the guy who cut all funding for public transport in the budget… and then he says that poor people don't have cars or don't drive very far,' Mr Albanese said. '[Mr Hockey] should go to western Sydney today and have a look at people driving all the way in to the city, or all the way into their workplace in any capital city from the outer metropolitan areas, they spend a higher proportion of their income than high income earners.' Mr Pyne said he thought Joe Hockey was doing 'an inspirational job' as treasurer but refused to confirm whether or not he supported Joe Hockey's comments that 'poor people don't drive' Joe Hockey has come under fire for his comments, which were made on ABC Radio as he was defending the government's proposed fuel excise . Mr Hockey has come under fire this week after remarking to ABC Radio on Wednesday that rich people spend more on fuel than poor households. 'The poorest people either don't have cars or actually don't drive very far in many cases,' he said. Mr Hockey made the controversial comments while defending the government's proposed fuel indexation, a budget measure opposed by both Labor and the Greens who say it will hit low-income families the hardest. The comments have caused widespread outrage, prompting Opposition Leader Bill Shorten to call Mr Hockey 'the cigar-chomping, Foghorn Leghorn of Australian politics', as well leading to criticism from Greens MPs, Coalition MPs and welfare groups. NSW Nationals senator John Williams and Queensland Liberal National senator Ian Macdonald criticised Hockey's comments on the grounds that people in the bush need cars. 'You have to have a car whether you're rich or poor, you need a vehicle to be able to get from one place to the other,' Mr Macdonald told ABC Radio on Thursday. 'Regional Australians don't have the alternative of public transport of other means of getting there.' Mr Hockey was also lambasted on social media with people using the hashtag #OtherThingsThePoorDontDo to poke fun at Mr Hockey's remark.","Joe Hockey publicly apologises for his controversial comments .

"By . Thomas Burrows for MailOnline . A record number of convicts escaped from secure mental health units in the last three years, with a 35 per cent rise recorded. Last year, 153 mentally disordered offenders - including dangerous convicted murderers - escaped from prisons and four who escaped before 2010 are still at large today. Tory MP Philip Davies, who has campaigned against Britain's 'soft-touch' system and an outspoken critic of judges, said far more needed to be done to protect the public. Lerone Boye, (left) who was convicted of stabbing a teenager, was found hiding under a bed after escaping for three months. Ian McLean (right) spent nine days on the run after breaking out of a mental health unit . He told MailOnline: 'The public are right to be concerned and clearly the system is not good enough. It is broken and needs fixing. Some of these people are extremely dangerous and should be in secure accommodation, but that accommodation is not particularly secure at the moment. 'It's the equivalent of an open prison, where people are given the opportunity to simply walk out of the grounds and that cannot be acceptable, but too often that's happening. 'Protecting the public should be the main priority, but in many cases, it is important to protect these criminals from themselves. 'They should never be given the opportunity to repeat their crimes they have been convicted of. The system is too lax and the rights of criminals seems to come above the safety of the public.' Philip Davies, MP, who has campaigned against the 'soft-touch' justice system in Britain . Adam Pemberton, Assistant Chief Executive of Victim Support, told MailOnline: 'Victims need to be able to have confidence that dangerous offenders will be held securely. 'Without this, it can be difficult for people to move on from crime. If any dangerous offenders do escape or abscond, it is essential that the authorities keep victims informed.' The number of people breaking out of mental health units from 113 in 2010, to 120 in 2011, to 146 in 2012, to a record 153 last year, the Sun said. So-called restricted patients are offenders with mental disorders who have been sent to secure or medium-secure hospitals for help. In recent years, a number of convicted killers have managed to escape from secure units. In July 2013, Ian McLean, who is serving a life sentence for repeatedly stabbing his girlfriend, was able to flee abroad after he walked out of a mental health facility in Littlemore, Oxfordshire and boarded a Eurostar train to Belgium. Ian McLean broke out of the Littlemore Mental Health Unit (pictured) and spent nine days on the run . He spent more than an hour in Brussels before anyone noticed he was missing. The career criminal then travelled to Berlin before moving on to the Polish seaside resort of Kolobrzeg. Abscond - where patient is given authorised leave but don't come back at the scheduled time . Escape - where patient leaves the premises without being granted leave . 2010 - 113 (106 absconds, 7 escapes) 2011 - 120 (104 absconds, 16 escapes) 2012 - 146 (135 absconds, 11 escapes) 2013 - 153 (142 absconds, 11 escapes) His escape forced police officers to place Michelle Storer – the ex-lover he stabbed – in protective custody. McLean was finally arrested in Kolobrzeg, 300 miles north-west of Warsaw, after nine days on the run. The next month, Daniel Rosenthal,  who murdered his mother and chopped her body into pieces with a hacksaw, escaped for a day from a mental health unit in Totton, on the edge of the New Forest in Hampshire. Rosenthal, dubbed the 'mad scientist', who has paranoid schizophrenia, escaped when he went on a 'routine, unsupervised walk' around the gardens of the hospital. In October 2013, Lerone Boye, 28 — who was convicted of stabbing a teenager to death at a club — went missing from a mental health unit. He was eventually found in January hiding under a bed in Chigwell, Essex. When asked whether his escape was worth it, he replied: 'Best three months of my life.' In June this year, Samuel Lee, who was jailed for life for subjecting a disabled woman to an hour-long rape ordeal, absconded from  the same place, the John Howard mental hospital in Hackney. He had previously been jailed for manslaughter in 1989, for stabbing a man to death. He was found in the Sussex seaside town of Eastbourne four days later. The Department of Health  said: He said: 'It's vital mental health units have robust security processes in place to stop patients who have committed a serious offence from escaping.'","153 offenders escaped from mental health units in 2013 - four still at large .

"By . Thomas Burrows for MailOnline . A father reported his own son to the police after he spent nearly £3,000 on Xbox games using the family business' credit card. Ian Holmes discovered his son Daniel, 20, had made dozens of payments to Microsoft's Xbox Live network. Holmes Jnr had permission to use the card for the family business as he had an investment in it - but continued to spend his father's money on gaming points and online subscriptions. Daniel Holmes, 20, made 77 payments to Microsoft's Xbox Live network, which totalled £2,800 . ‘Microsoft Points’ are an online currency that allows players to unlock new features in their favourite games - without having to enter a password. Holmes Jnr made 77 payments to Xbox live, which came to £2,400. With interest this totalled £2,800, North Devon Magistrates' heard on Friday. The court heard how the fraud went unnoticed throughout 2013 until Mr Holmes - who did not own an Xbox - noticed the payments on his credit card statement. Lyndsey Baker, prosecuting, said: 'He confronted his son and he admitted it but his father knew he could not pay it.' Tim Hook, defending, said Holmes Jnr had made an investment in his father's business and had obtained the credit card details legitimately. The case reached North Devon Magistrates' Court because Mr Holmes realised his son could not re-pay him . Mr Hook said: 'The defendant continued to use it, on each occasion buying Xbox games and carrying on a form of gambling which increased into a relatively substantial sum. 'His father asked him to repay it. He said he was extremely annoyed and ""could hit him""'. Mr Hook told the court that the case had come before them because Mr Holmes realised his son was unable to repay the debt at the required rate of £200 a month, as he was unemployed. He added: 'It is sad this domestic matter was put to the police.' Probation officer Mel Wright, said: 'It seemed he got hooked on what he was doing, and he got deeper and deeper.' Holmes Jnr, of Ilfracombe, Devon, was ordered to do 100 hours of unpaid work and pay compensation of £2,097.88. Presiding magistrate Michael Buckley said: 'This is a very sad case.'","Ian Holmes found that his son, Daniel, 20, had spent nearly £3,000 on Xbox games using the family business' credit card .

"By . Thomas Burrows for MailOnline . A fall off a faulty chair, taking a tumble on a wet floor, struggling to get in and out of a car and being bitten by a dog. It might sound more like the plot for a comedy film - but in fact, these bizarre occurrences are some of the compensation claims made by a single police force to its officers in the last year. West Midlands Police had to fork out nearly £600,000 on personal injury claims brought by 26 officers. West Midlands police officers were awarded almost £600,000 in 26 personal injury claims (stock photo) The officers were successfully awarded compensation for a string of injuries, including a fall off a faulty chair, dog bites and one who was hit by a car park barrier. Another got a pay-out after he was clobbered by a colleague with a baton who was trying to break a car window with it. A further three officers were injured by their colleagues while on a job. The biggest claims relate to officers who tripped and fell at work. Three officers slipped on wet floors, two sustained injuries after moving furniture, one tripped in a 'dark corridor' and another tripped in a 'hole in the office floor'. Somewhat ironically, three officers were also hurt during their personal safety training. Other payouts were for an officer suffering from an asbestos-related disease and one who developed stress from being exposed to HIV. In total, £328,100 was paid in compensation to officers, while a further £260,900 was handed out to lawyers dealing with the 26 cases. Some of the unusual compensation claims made by officers took place in the West Midlands Police headquarters (pictured), including officers who slipped on wet floors, or tripped on a hole in the office floor . Last year, it was revealed that a West Midlands officer received nearly £8,000 in compensation after being bitten by fleas while at work. In March this year, a Freedom of Information request found that police officers who suffered an injury at work had claimed as much as £85 million in compensation in the last five years. This included a £130,000 payout to one individual after he fell over and broke his hip in a store room while on duty. The other claims included one who received £16,610 for tripping over blankets while chasing a criminal, one who got £43,000 for a back injury after a slip on ice and another who was paid £8,130 for falling over some photocopy paper. Critics denounced the figures and said that money on policing could be spent more usefully elsewhere. West Midlands Police have made £126 million of cuts since 2010, and is expected to make £23 million of savings in the current financial year. Andy Silvester, from the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'These figures are shocking. 'Either the force is failing to deliver a safe working environment, or they're paying out on spurious claims, but either way it's taxpayers that end up footing the bill. 'Every penny spent on compensation is a penny that can't be spent on fighting crime and anti-social behaviour, and this pay-out culture cannot be allowed to continue.' Slip on wet floor x 3 .

Trip in hole in office floor . Work related upper limb disorder (repetitive strain injury) Fall from faulty office chair . But Assistant Chief Constable of West Midlands Police, Marcus Beale, defended the moneyspent on compensation claims. He said: 'Police officers face dangerous situations on a daily basis while on duty, protecting people from harm. 'This is a fundamental nature of the job and a reality accepted by West Midlands Police officers and staff, whose health and safety we take extremely seriously. 'The force, together with unions and staff associations, have a robust joint delivery health and safety plan, which has led to a reduction in accidents involving officers of 7.5 per cent over the past year. 'We are responsible for our employees when they are on duty and when we fall short of meeting that responsibility, they are entitled to protection under the law and seek redress through the courts. 'Compensation payouts are only made following the assessment of appropriate medical evidence by our legal team, insurers and solicitors, who then make a recommendation to the force as to what payment should be made.' Not all claims have however been successful or been pursued. In September 2013, PC Kelly Jones, who planned to sue the owner of a petrol station after tripping on a kerb while investigating a break-in, dropped her claim for damages. Ms Jones faced controversy after she filed a civil claim against Steve Jones, a garage owner in Thetford, Norfolk, demanding he reimburse the income she lost as a result of injuries sustained at the scene. She had filed against the owner of the Nun's Bridges Filling Station, claiming he failed to ensure she was 'reasonably safe' after responding to a reported burglary. She allegedly fell and hurt her leg and wrist while checking the building in August 2012.","West Midlands Police spent nearly £600,000 on personal injury claims brought by 26 officers in the last year .

He said: 'I decided to give it a go and I made about four batches in an old saucepan without any problem. 'But the saucepan I was working with was a cheap one and the bottom had all scratched away and some of the inside metal was getting thinner and thinner. 'I was caramelising the mixture into a paste and I'd pulled it off the hob slightly, but there was one edge that was still on and that got red hot. 'When I went to put it back on the hob and stir it one last time, the bottom fell off the saucepan and the mixture hit the hob. 'That's when it went bang. It lit instantly and blew up in my face. 'Most of the flames were sucked up by the extractor fan, but they also engulfed my body as I did not have a shirt on.

The deadly blaze was started after Badger’s former boyfriend, Michael Borcina, put smouldering ashes from the hearth into the outside mudroom of their house, according to authorities. Badger, however, is convinced that an electrical fault was the cause, having seen sparks shooting from an electrical box at the back of the house as the fire spread. She remains baffled as to why the smoke alarms installed in the property did not go off. It was being renovated at the time and Badger’s ex-husband, Matthew Badger, is suing Borcina for wrongful death and negligence, claiming that the home ‘had become a firetrap as a result of months of substandard construction’, according to the New York Post. Matthew Badger had a tense chance meeting with Mr Borcina in New York recently. Mr Borcina asked Mr Badger if he could hug him, but the request was not indulged, according to nymag.com.

"By . Thomas Burrows for MailOnline . Dramatic footage has been released of a drug dealer's first attempt to run over a man he murdered moments later. Jake Austin, 25, from Gillingham, Kent, was sentenced to life imprisonment today after being found guilty at Maidstone Crown Court of the murder of John O'Donohue. He must serve a minimum of 18 years before he is considered for parole. Jake Austin, 25, tried to mow down John O'Donohue, 33, and his friend over an argument about a drugs sale . Austin missed on his first attempt to hit Mr O'Donohue, 33 and his friend following an argument in Gillingham, Kent . Austin failed to hit Mr O'Donohue the first time, but then turned the car around and drove at them again. He crashed through metal railings and ran over Mr O'Donohue, who suffered fatal head injuries when he hit the windscreen . Mr O'Donohue, 33, and a friend had arranged to meet Austin and his associate at flats in Grange Road, Gillingham, on the evening of January 23. During their meeting, an argument broke out after Mr O'Donohue and his friend attempted to con Austin by including worthless paper among cash for cocaine and heroin and the four got into a fight. Mr O'Donohue and his friend tried to walk away when Austin - known as Guez or G - got into his Ford Mondeo and drove after them. The CCTV footage captured the moment when Austin drove straight at the pair, in Castlemaine Avenue, Gillingham. The pair managed to evade Austin's first attempt to mow them over by running up a grass verge. Austin, 25, (left) was sentenced to life imprisonment at Maidstone Crown Court today for the murder of John O'Donohue, 33, (right) in Gillingham, Kent on the evening of January 23 . But he then turned the car around and drove at them again. He crashed through metal railings and ran over Mr O'Donohue, who suffered fatal head injuries when he hit the windscreen. Austin, who called his mother and asked her to report the Ford Mondeo as stolen, went on the run and was arrested four days later in Swindon. Austin was charged with murder and later admitted the manslaughter of Mr O'Donohue, but yesterday he was found guilty of murder at Maidstone Crown Court and today, he was sentenced to life behind bars. He was also sentenced to three-and-a-half years, to be served concurrently, for possessing drugs with intent to supply. Judge Jeremy Carey said: 'I have to sentence you for the gravest offence in the criminal calendar, namely murder. 'You were convicted by the jury on what I judge to be clear evidence.' Austin murdered Mr O'Donohue by mowing him down in his Ford Mondeo. He had already tried once to run him down. Detective inspector Ivan Beasley of Kent Police said: 'Austin murdered Mr O'Donohue with absolute deliberate actions. 'He was calculating as he drove at speed towards him, not slowing down even when he made contact with his victim and crashed through railings and wall. 'John O'Donohue was a loving father, partner and son. He has tragically been taken away from his family and friends and our thoughts are with them today.' Mr O'Donohue's family said in a statement: 'We as a family know that life will never be the same without John. John's children now have to grow up without their dad. 'When the time is right, however, we will now be able to tell them that justice was finally done.'","Jake Austin, 25, was sentenced to life imprisonment for murdering John O'Donohue, 33 .

"By . Emma Glanfield for MailOnline . Two British sisters who survived 18 hours in the Indian Ocean after the tour boat they were travelling on sank in rough seas have told how they chose not to join their fellow survivors in drinking urine and eating leaves to stay alive. Backpackers Katherine Ostojic, 21, and her 19-year-old sister Alice, managed to sit on the overturned semi-submerged hull of the stricken vessel for ten hours after it got into difficulty off the island of Lombok. However, after realising their chances of being rescued were becoming slimmer by the minute, they had no option but to join eight fellow survivors in swimming to an island on the horizon – a journey which took them eight hours. Scroll down for videos . Katherine Ostojic, 21, (left) and her 19-year-old sister Alice (right) managed to survive the tour boat sinking off the island on Lombok on Saturday by floating for ten hours at sea and swimming a further eight hours to shore . Katherine (centre left in green t-shirt) and Alice  (holding a mobile phone) pictured in the hours after the rescue . It was there that some of the survivors drank their own urine and ate leaves to stay alive – although the sisters, who are both keen travellers, said they chose not to partake in doing so. The group were eventually rescued by fishermen and all were given food and water before being flown to Bali. The rescue, along with an earlier rescue of 15 others, means 23 of the 25 people on board the rickety vessel have been saved from the disaster. A search is ongoing for two Spanish men who remain missing at sea after separating from the group when the boat capsized. When back on the mainland, the girls were quick to send a string of emails to their mother Joan and her husband Peter to let them know they were safe and well. In one they wrote: 'They have found everyone now. Such a relief. The boat sank in the middle of the night. 'We sat on its roof while it was semi-submerged for ten hours. Then swam eight hours to the shore before seeing the lights of some fishermen and getting them to pick us up.' 'N.B no urine was drunk and no leaves were eaten, at least not by us.' Alice (right) has spent the last five months travelling the world on a gap year while her sister Katherine (right) is a Bristol University student who joined her sister about a month ago in Indonesia for a stint of backpacking . Alice, 19, said in an email to her parents this week that the sisters would return back to the UK at the weekend . Katherine (pictured on a previous trip) flew out to join her sister after completing a summer course in Austria . These are the emails sent from Katherine and Alice to their parents following the ordeal at the weekend. Sunday 17/08/2014 . Hello. In case the embassy haven't contacted yet, we were involved in the Indonesian boat sinking but are fine having swum to shore. The British embassy in Denpasar are helping us. Will contact you when we can. Love Katherine and Alice . Monday 18/08/2014 from Katherine . They have found everyone now, such a relief. To sum up what happened because the press are wrong, the boat sank in the middle of the night, we sat on its roof while it was semi submerged for 10 hours, then swam for 8 hours to the shore before seeing the lights of some fishermen and getting them to pick us up. Spent the night on an uninhabited active volcanic island with the fishermen who gave us food and water before we were taken back to a larger island. Monday 18/08/14 from Alice . I don't know if you've heard already, but everyone from the boat has now been found and is safe on Sumbawa. We went to the British Consulate (they even picked us up from the airport!) to sort out some things, and we have to go to the Immigration Office tomorrow to check our passports are still working after getting wet. They were really helpful there and told us they'd follow up on the situation. We're still planning to stay in Indonesia until our original flights home, since it's not possible to change them, but I think some downtime will be appreciated anyway. Their mother Joan, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, today told how relieved she was that they managed to survive the ordeal, which occurred overnight on Saturday as the tour boat was travelling to Komodo Island – a popular destination with tourists due to its Komodo dragons. She said: 'They are only adequate swimmers, but they had life jackets on. 'I am very happy that they have been rescued and we are expecting to see them again in about a week's time.' In fact, Mrs Ostojic, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, said the first she heard of the disaster was when she received the emails from her daughters. She said: 'I'm glad I didn't know about it beforehand. It means I didn't have time to worry. 'The girls are fine but a little sunburnt. They have limited access to email, so we have not been able to get the full story. It is thought Katherine (left) and Alice (right) had been joined by their cousin Jack Seaton (centre) on the trip . Katherine (pictured on a previous trip) and her sister swam for eight hours to a volcanic island after the boat sank in rough seas on Saturday. They were later rescued by a passing fisherman who saw their lifejackets . 'The girls had a lovely time climbing the Rinjani volcano on Lombok, and were on their way to see the Komodo dragon when the incident happened. 'They are fine, carrying on with their travels and they will be home on the weekend. I'm looking forward to seeing them both and hearing all about it.' She also said that both daughters were concerned there had been insufficient safety measures on the boat and now want to help rally for improved safety. 'They are both eager that the Indonesian Government should take action to improve safety for passengers travelling on boats like theirs,' she added. 'They said there wasn't even a radio on board.' The other rescued passengers included five Dutch, four Germans, three Italians, two each from Spain and New Zealand, and one each from France and Britain. Two Spanish remain missing at sea following the disaster . One female survivor, known only as Alice, receives treatment at a hospital in Sape after being rescued .

"By . Emma Glanfield for MailOnline . The outcome of a child's GCSE results are down not only to the hours spent revising but also the mindset of their mother, an academic study has revealed. Research published by the London School of Economics' Centre for Economic Performance (CEP) shows that babies born to mothers who are strong believers that their fate is in their hands perform up to 17 per cent better in exams when they grow up. The study, which analysed data from the University of Bristol's Children of the 90s project – a long-term study of the attitudes and behaviour of 10,000 young people, tracked the formation of a key personality trait known as 'locus of control'. Children perform up to 17 per cent better in their GCSE exams if their mother is a strong believer that their fate is in their own hands, research published by the London School of Economics' Centre found (file picture) Those with an 'internal locus' believe they can entirely direct the course of their life while those with an extremely 'external locus' believe their life path is influenced solely by luck or fate. While most people tend to fall somewhere between these two extremes, those with a very 'internal locus' tend to invest more into their education than those who fall at the other end of the spectrum. Dr Francesca Cornaglia said the research proved that the influence of a mother's personality was highly influential of a child's education. The Queen Mary University of London economist told The Guardian: 'Holding other things constant – including family background, mother's education and children's own locus of control – we find that children whose mothers ranked in the top 25% of the internal locus of control scale tended to obtain total GCSE scores around 17% higher than children whose mothers ranked in the bottom 25%.' Professor Nattavudh Powdthavee, a senior author of the recent study, said that mothers who have a strong 'internal locus' tend to take a more hands-on approach to parenting. He told the newspaper: 'This is simply because they strongly believe their actions will make a difference in their child's life. 'Consequently, they tend to engage their children in more cognitively stimulating activities such as reading and singing. This seems to have given their children a head start in terms of cognitive development.' Mothers who believe they can determine their own fate take a more hands-on approach to parenting, the study found. Researchers analysed the lives of 10,000 young people in Bristol for the study (file picture) The research comes after it was revealed that a record number of appeals are expected over this year's GCSE and A-level results amid a toughening up of the qualifications. Exams watchdog Ofqual has already told schools to expect 'particularly volatile' GCSE results as grades are likely to dip following major changes to the exams system in England. Changes to GCSEs include a switch to end-of-year exams, the downgrading of coursework and a clampdown on resits by only including a pupil's first attempt in official league tables. It means an unprecedented number of challenges from pupils who are unhappy with their results is expected when the results are released on Thursday.","Those born to adults who think fate is in own hands perform better in exams .

"By . Matthew Blake for MailOnline . and Richard Shears In Bali for MailOnline . and Emma Glanfield for MailOnline . Fifteen tourists remain missing at sea and ten others, including two Britons, had to swim six hours to safety after a tour boat sank in rough seas off an Indonesian Island. The British tourists were among ten passengers who survived the ordeal after swimming from the stricken vessel to a remote island where they were greeted by an erupting volcano and had to spend the night drinking their own urine. They are now recovering in hospital while a huge search and rescue operation scours a 250 mile stretch of sea between the islands of Lombok, east of Bali, and Komodo Island, where the boat went down. These are the first pictures to emerge of the tourists who were rescued when the tour boat went down in rough seas after hitting a reef between the Indonesian islands of Lombok, east of Bali, and Komodo Island . Among the ten rescued are two Britons and passengers from Germany, France, New Zealand and Spain . As well as the two Britons rescued from the stricken vessel, which sank after hitting a reef in huge waves on Saturday, passengers from Germany, France, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Spain have also been saved. However, 15 foreign passengers remain missing and the Foreign Office confirmed that more British nationals could be among them. Indonesian officials said it was believed the boat was thrown onto a reef in rough seas and sank very quickly as it made the journey between the islands, which usually takes three days. Bertrand Homassel, a French survivor, said the boat started sinking slowly after its hull was damaged in the storm and said he and the other survivors had to swim for several hours to shore to save themselves. While six people managed to be taken to safety in a lifeboat, the others were forced to keep afloat for more than 12 hours in the water before taking action. He said: 'Six people were in the lifeboat. The others climbed onto the roof of the boat, which had not completely sunk,' he said, speaking from a hotel in Bima on Sumbawa island, where the survivors were taken after being rescued. The Foreign Office said it was providing consular assistance to the Britons hospitalised after being rescued . While ten passengers have been rescued from the rough seas (above), 15 other tourists remain missing . 'We waited until midday on Saturday. We were five kilometres (three miles) from the coast - there were many big waves separating us from the coast. 'People started to panic... Everyone took the decision to swim to the closest island, five kilometres away, where there was an erupting volcano.' He said they swam for six hours and arrived on the island, Sangeang, as the sun was setting. They spent Saturday night there, surviving by drinking their own urine and eating leaves. On Sunday, they attracted the attention of a passing boat by waving their life jackets, and were rescued and taken to Bima, he said. 'I was really very lucky,' Homassel added. Indonesian police said they were not prepared to release the names of the others rescued until proof of identity could be ascertained – as all passports, credit cards, personal belongings were lost when the tour boat went down in the dark. The vessel sank while travelling between a notorious 250 mile stretch of water between the islands of Lombok, east of Bali (pictured) and Komodo Island. A total of 15 foreigners remain missing at sea after tragedy struck . The boat had set out to sail to the tourist attraction of Komodo Island, a drawcard because of the diving it attracts when seas are calm and because of the unique wildlife - the famous but fierce monitor lizards, also known as Komodo dragons. The seas were rough throughout the journey and even on the island of Bali, hundreds of miles to the west, tourists were complaining of the high tides and strong winds. Komodo Island is one of several islands which make up the Komodo National Park, a protected area that is home to the Komodo dragon. The huge lizards can grow up to three metres (10 feet) long and have a venomous bite. Indonesia relies heavily on boats to connect its more than 17,000 islands, but has a poor maritime safety record. Two vessels sank last month in different parts of the archipelago as millions travelled for the Muslim Eid holiday, leaving at least 36 people dead. Fatal boat sinkings involving asylum-seeker vessels trying to make the treacherous sea crossing from Indonesia to Australia are also common. But boat sinkings involving foreign tourists are rare, with accidents in Indonesia's booming aviation sector more of a danger for overseas visitors in recent years. However, it was on the northern reaches of Sambawa Island - some 20 miles west of Komodo island - that the vessel came to grief. Police on Sambawa Island's main town of Bima said it was believed that the vessel had been thrown onto the reef by the weather, damaged by the coral, and had sunk within minutes. According to Suryman, a search and rescue official in Bima who, like many Indonesians uses only one name, the boat sank at night on Saturday. 'Fishermen managed to rescue five of them alive later at night on Saturday and then the other five were picked up by a sailing boat,' he said. It is not known if the rescued British tourists are related, although one is believed to be male. Budiawan, head of the search and rescue agency in Mataram, the provincial capital of West Nusatenggara, said the boat was carrying 20 foreign tourists, four Indonesian crewmen and an Indonesian guide when it sank just after midnight due to bad weather. He said at least four ships were currently involved in the search and rescue mission. Suryaman, a search and rescue official, said the boat had sunk in the early hours of Saturday, but it was not until Saturday evening that those who were rescued were picked up. Tourist vessels and local fishermen have been scouring the area for survivors today, but their efforts have been hampered by dusk which has started to fall in the region. While ten people have been rescued, the fate of the remaining 15 is unknown and there are grave fears for their safety after being in the sea for almost 24 hours. The tourists were on their way to Komodo Island to see Komodo dragons (pictured) when the boat sank . The Foreign Office confirmed other British nationals may have been involved in the accident. A spokeswoman said: 'We are aware that two British nationals have been hospitalised following an incident in West Nusa Tenggara, Eastern Indonesia. We are providing consular assistance. 'We are in contact with the local authorities about the incident and stand ready to offer consular assistance to any other British nationals who may be involved.' She would not comment on the state of their injuries. Lombok is an island in the Indonesian archipelago, east of Bali. Home to around 3.1 million Indonesians, it attracts thousands of tourists every year.","Vessel sank between island of Lombok, east of Bali, and Komodo Island .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans for MailOnline . and Emma Glanfield for MailOnline . An investigation has been launched amid fears nearly 160 cases of Salmonella poisoning across the UK could be linked. Public Health England (PHE) said it was looking into a national outbreak of Salmonella Enteritidis after cases were reported in Hampshire, London, the West Midlands, Cheshire and Merseyside. The cases occurred in 'isolated clusters' over several months but officials now say they could be potentially linked. Public Health England has launched an investigation  into a national salmonella outbreak after 156 cases were reported across Hampshire, the West Midlands, London, Merseyside and Cheshire (file picture) Genetic tests suggest that the cause of illness in the 156 people could have come from a single source, PHE said. Investigators are working alongside the Food Standards Agency to look into the cause of the outbreak - which may have also affected people in France and Austria. Dr Paul Cleary, a consultant epidemiologist leading the PHE investigation, said: 'We are working with our colleagues across PHE, at the Food Standards Agency, in local authorities and with other public health organisations in Europe to investigate the cause of this outbreak. 'We are making good progress and hope to have more conclusive evidence shortly. 'We will continue to monitor the situation and if there is any further public health action necessary then we will ensure that this takes place.' Across England experts are examining 55 cases in Hampshire, 32 of which have been connected with an oriental restaurant, and 33 cases in Cheshire and Merseyside, 31 of which have been linked to one oriental takeaway. Symptoms of Salmonella (above) include vomiting, diarrhea, fever, headaches, nausea and stomach cramps . PHE are also looking at 43 cases in the West Midlands, 34 of which were connected with the Birmingham Heartlands Hospital outbreak. Anyone can get salmonella, but young children, the elderly and people whose immune systems are not working properly have a greater risk of becoming severely ill. Symptoms include watery diarrhoea, stomach cramps and sometimes vomiting and fever. These symptoms usually last for four to seven days and clear up without treatment, but if you become seriously ill you may need to be treated for dehydration (fluid loss) caused by the illness. Transmission occurs by eating contaminated food, mainly of animal origin, or by faecal contamination from an infected person or animal. The Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the Birmingham hospital, confirmed the outbreak in June and said four members of staff and 19 patients had tested positive for the common strain of salmonella. All were suffering from diarrhoea and vomiting – which are typical symptoms of the bug. PHE also said officials were looking at 25 cases of reported salmonella poisoning in London. Salmonella Enteritidis is a strain of bacteria that causes gastrointestinal illness and is often linked to poultry or eggs. Professor Anthony Hilton, head of biological and biomedical science at Aston University, said: 'If the cases are related, the next important stage will be identifying common risk factors which are associated with the infected individuals. 'This might be consumption of a contaminated food or ingredient or even a common exposure at an event or activity. 'Compiling food and exposure histories of cases occurring over several months can be complex and time-consuming, depending on the quality of the information available, and it may be some time before we know the true extent of the outbreak and the causative link, if any.'","Public Health England said reported 156 reported cases in UK may be linked .

"By . Candace Sutton For Daily Mail Australia . The matriarch of a family of 40 adults and children found living in incestuous relationships on a squalid bush block in country NSW will learn her fate next month over charges she tried to abduct two of her children. Betty Colt was found by police and . welfare officers in 2012 sharing a marital bed with her brother Charlie, . as her children - some as young as ten - were engaging in sex . with their underage aunts and uncles, could face up to 10 years' prison. Her sons, aged 16 and 15, were among . five of her 13 children taken from her in 2012 because they were the . product of a sexual union between Ms Colt and either her father, brother or . another close male relative. Today, the 48-year-old, whose real name has been withheld by the Children's Court of NSW, is due to appear at Moss Vale Magistrates Court on Monday charged with plotting to kidnap two of her sons back from foster carers. Betty Colt, a member of the infamous 'Colt' incest family, arrives at Moss Vale local court with her lawyer . The family were hidden in the hills above a tiny hamlet in New South Wales. There, four generations of a family practised a cult of incest hidden from the world . Ms Colt also faces charges of . recruiting her son Bobby (a court appointed name) to commit a criminal . act in the plot in which she allegedly planned to take the boys from . their foster home in the middle of the night. Ms Colt had secretly given her sons a mobile phone which they kept in a plastic bag in a bush on the foster property. Magistrate Mary Ryan acknowledged in Moss Vale Court on Monday that a legal delay in delivery of the transcript of a hearing in June, when Bobby Colt gave evidence by video link, required the matter be held over. A decision will be handed down on September 1. She and her 13 children were among 38 inter-related adults and children discovered two years ago living in filthy conditions in the hills surrounding a picturesque farming community nestled in a valley southwest of Sydney. Betty is accused of hatching a plan to kidnap her sons from foster carers . The children had facial deformities, could not speak intelligibly, did not know what a toothbrush or toilet paper were. They were living in filthy caravans and tents with no running water or electricity. The case of the Colt family is considered to be perhaps the nation's most appalling saga of child abuse and is among one of the worst accounts of incest ever made public. The NSW Children's Court took the rare step last December of revealing the actions it took to remove children from the Colt family (a court-appointed pseudonym to protect identification of minors). Four generations of intimate relations among the Colts had taken place in South Australia, Victoria, Western Australia and finally in NSW. The adults of family discovered living in squalor in regional NSW in July 2012, are now under investigation for child abuse . Moving state to state, possibly to evade detection, the scandal only came to light because of a schoolyard conversation involving one of the children living in the hills who did attend school. One of the Colt family children was overheard saying at the school, 'My sister is pregnant and we don’t know which of my brothers is the father’. The remark triggered a raid in July 2012, when officers from the NSW Police State Crime Command Child Sexual Abuse Squad and Family and Community Services officers turned up at the block, which lies around 30km out of the town between large established farms and untamed scrub. They found the 40 adults and children living in two filthy caravans, two sheds and tents on an unsewered block with no plumbing. Dirt caked the surfaces of stoves and cooking facilities, rotten vegetables lay in a refrigerator and a kangaroo was sleeping on one of the children's beds. The court heard allegations she snuck a mobile phone and charger as well as a copy of her telephone number to her sons during monitored visits, with instructions for their 'escape plan' Exposed electric wires, bags of rubbish and chainsaws lay about. There were no toilets, showers or baths. The children were unwashed, wore dirty clothes and almost all had fungal infections on their feet. They were shy and made little eye contact, and the welfare officers learned that few were capable of intelligible speech. Some had oddly-formed facial features, which scientific tests would later reveal was a result of 'homozygosity', or identical gene patterns of both of the children's parents. As shocked as the police and welfare officers were with the squalor and the children, who seemed developmentally delayed or cognitively impaired, they were unaware immediately of the social time bomb emerging on the property. In July 2012, officers from the NSW . Police State Crime Command Child Sexual Abuse Squad and Family and . Community Services officers turned up at the block, which lies around . 30km out of the town between large established farms and untamed scrub . What they didn't realise was the children were the result of intimate relations between brothers and sisters, and uncles and nieces and fathers and daughters. Their family threw back to a set of great-great grandparents who were a brother and sister. The family groups on the property comprised of sisters, Rhonda, 47, Martha, 33, and Betty Colt, 46, who slept every night with her brother, Charlie, and two of Betty's daughters who each had children who proved to be from unions of related parents. Not only were the children dirty and unschooled, they had multiple health problems and no concept of hygiene. Betty's son Bobby Colt, 15, had a walking impairment, severe psoriasis and needed urgent dental work. The family clung together, generation after generation, rarely visiting the town, wandering from one temporary encampment to another . His speech was not understandable. He wet and soiled the bed and his learning ability was at kindergarten level. Martha's sons Albert, 15, and Jed, 14, were similarly challenged with their speech, personal hygiene and lack of dentistry. Betty's 14-year-old son Billy was underweight and not growing properly, had hearing and sight problems, spoke unintelligibly, had an intellectual disability and could barely read or count. Kimberly Colt, 14, Betty's granddaughter, was underweight and unable to clean her teeth, use toilet paper or comb her hair. She had urgent dental problems, hearing, speech and sight issues and was unable to read or write.She threatened to cut off a caseworker's fingers. Betty's son Brian, 12, did not understand showering and had extensively decayed teeth, and borderline normal hearing. His eyes were misaligned and he could not read, write, or recognise numbers. Ten of the children had parents who were probably father and daughter or brother and sister. They lived in buildings similar to this. File picture . Martha's nine-year-old daughter Ruth was neglected and malnourished. She was unable to bathe or dry herself. She did not know how to use a toilet or what toilet paper was. Her features were dysmorphic. She could not read or write, couldn't hear well and her speech was fragmented and stunted. The caseworkers left and returned again two days later, making a further two visits and finally removed 12 children on July 18, 2012. Taken into care, the children underwent sessions with psychologists and told mind-bending tales of intimate sexual contact between the hildren who were all related. Betty's 14-year-old rand-daughter, Kimberly reported sexual contact with her uncle, Dwayne (betty's son) who was nine years old, while Dwayne's sister, Carmen, 8, watched on. Dwayne and Carmen were Betty's children by a relative, DNA tests later proved. Sisters Ruth, 7, and Nadia, 9, had sexual touching with their brothers Albert, 15, Jed, 14, and Karl, 12. On one occasion, three brothers aged 14 years and under tied their sister, 8, and niece, 13, naked to a tree. The accounts of incestuous underage sex filled pages of court documents. Clinicians took mouth swabs from the children and geneticists deduced five of the Colt children had parents who were 'closely related' and another five had parents who were 'related'. Further interviews with the three sisters revealed the astonishing story that Betty, Martha and Rhonda's maternal grandparents had been brother and sister. Some of Betty's 13 children were probably fathered by her father, Tim, and her brother, Charlie.Martha's children may also have been fathered by Tim. Betty's son, Bobby, and Martha's children, Albert, Jed, Ruth and Nadia were the result of closely related parents, as were the three children of Betty's daughter, Tammy, 27, one of whom had died from a rare genetic disease called Zellweger syndrome. Victorian Police removed Tammy's remaining two daughters when they found her living in a caravan park and she revealed her younger brother, Derek, 25, had fathered all her children. The 12 children removed from the property, including Betty's son, Bobby, were placed with foster families or state institutions and some were in treatment programs for sexualised behaviour and psychological trauma, and they have some contact with their parents and siblings. They have made progress with schooling and hygiene. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Betty Colt is a member of the infamous 'Colt' incest family of 40 people .

"By . Emma Glanfield for MailOnline . A classical musician is suing police for loss of earnings after a PCSO stopped him from busking in a town centre and called him a 'beggar and a 'vagrant'. Professional flautist and singer Barry Jackson, 48, was singing Luciano Pavarotti arias and playing music in a shopping precinct in Sale, Greater Manchester, when the female community officer ordered him to move on saying he was causing an obstruction. The intervention under the Vagrancy Act 1824 forced Mr Jackson, from Walkden, Greater Manchester, to abandon his five hour stint after just 45 minutes. Barry Jackson, 48, has launched a case against Greater Manchester Police claiming loss of earnings after being told to move along by a PCSO and apparently being called a 'beggar' and a 'vagrant' while he performed . The professional flautist and singer was singing Luciano Pavarotti arias and playing music in a shopping precinct in Sale, Greater Manchester, when he was moved along by the PCSO under the Vagrant Act 1824 . He later consulted a solicitor and has now filed complaints to Greater Manchester Police and the Independent Police Complaints Commission. The father-of-one who received his classical music training as a flautist and tenor singer at Salford College of Music for two years before training at the Manchester College of Music said: 'I am not a beggar or a vagrant - I am a professional musician, classically trained who has been through years of training to learn my craft. 'I have been in orchestras and choirs. I can sight read, I can join a group of musicians and sight read straight away and I find it very sad the PCSO should react in this way. 'It's bad a day when buskers are tarred with the same brush as aggressive beggars. We're not doing any harm - in fact we are playing beautiful music. Busking is a great British tradition but it seems someone in authority wants to restrict street culture and that is bad for all for all performers who perform in the street like me. 'I always try to be a responsible performer, never obstructing and definitely never asking for money. I simply play so people hear my work and it's a great platform for showcasing what I can do. There is no way I would demand or pester anyone for money.' Mr Jackson, who also plays viola, entered the music industry at 16 having picked up a flute when he was just eight years old. The father-of-one claims he lost about £40 in earnings after his set was cut short after just 45 minutes . The singer was performing a number Pavarotti favourites including Nessun Dorma when he was moved along . After leaving college he became a blue coat entertainer at a Pontins holiday camp and has played with a variety of musicians including Scottish singer-songwriter Jim Diamond and jazz saxophonist Christopher 'Snake' Davis. The incident occurred last month while he was performing in Sale town centre when he started singing Pavarotti favourites like Nessun Dorma and a complaint was made to the police. Mr Jackson, a high baritone, said: 'A PCSO arrived and said the complaint had been about someone singing and dancing and there was a lady dancing nearby who was nothing to do with me. There are no laws against busking in the UK, although those wishing to do so are strongly advised by authorities to seek permission from the local council. Each authority operates a different policy on busking but some stipulate that a licence is necessary to be able to busk in a public area. While busking is not illegal, there are rules which those doing so must follow. They are: . Children under 14 aren’t allowed to busk. In contrast, under the Vagrancy Act 1824, it is an offence to sleep rough or beg in England and Wales. Those doing so will be told to move along and can be arrested. Those who continue to persistently flout the law can face jail for the offence. 'I said to the PSCO, ""can I stop you there? I am not with this woman. I work on my own. This lady is dancing. I am not."" The lady even told the PCSO she wasn't with me. But the PCSO just signalled me out and called me a beggar and a vagrant which got me really upset. 'As I remember she said ""you are a beggar"". She only said that when it was just me and her. I told her it was wrong and that her comment was inflammatory. 'I said ""I am not a beggar, I am a street performer"". She replied ""actually it's not, its vagrancy"". 'I was so shocked. They are meant to know the law and enforce the law fairly but she had it all wrong.' 'She told me I was causing an obstruction and told me to move on. I was shocked. I couldn't believe it. 'I always make sure my equipment is contained and not obstructing anything. She could clearly see that. To be sent away at midday meant I missed out on a good four more hours of performing.' Mr Jackson who claims he can earn up to £90 in one day of street performing believes he missed out on £40 because of the incident. He added: 'I rehearse many hours a day and to be called a beggar is very insulting. When I busk I normally stay all day but after this incident I left after 45 minutes. 'I was in choirs from a young boy as a soprano and my mother was a soprano. She is one of the main reasons I became classically trained - she said if you are going to be a professional musician you might as well do it properly.' He said: 'I have been trying to make it for years but sadly I haven't have my break yet. But if I had a penny for the times people come up to me when I am busking and say ""you should be on the TV"" or ""you shouldn't be here"", I would be a rich man. 'There are so many talented singers out there but some like me aren't lucky enough to get discovered. I reckon I lost about £40 and I cannot afford to lose this money.' Mr Jackson started out as a blue coat entertainer at a Pontins holiday camp and has played with a variety of musicians including Scottish singer-songwriter Jim Diamond and jazz saxophonist Christopher 'Snake' Davis . Greater Manchester Police said: 'We can confirm a complaint was made about officer conduct and they have been advised.' The IPCC confirmed it had also received a complaint. Trafford Council confirmed it does not issue a specific licence for busking but added: 'If we are contacted by someone about busking we advise they should be mindful of shoppers and businesses by responsible and not cause an obstruction or nuisance. 'They are also advised to be considerate and move on if asked by a business or the police.'","Flautist Barry Jackson was asked to move along in Sale, Greater Manchester .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Health scare: Rick Parfitt, 65, has been hospitalised in Pula, north Croatia, forcing Status Quo to cancel their gig and the next six hours ahead of performing . Status Quo have been forced to cancel their European tour hours before taking to the stage after guitarist Rick Parfitt was taken ill in Croatia. The band, known for hits such as Whatever You Want and Rockin' All Over The World, had been due to play in the northern city of Pula tonight. But just hours ahead of their performance, they have been forced to cancel the show - and the following six. Parfitt, 65, who had a quadruple heart bypass in 1997, was forced to cancel a series of shows nine years ago to have tests for suspected throat cancer. He has since spoken of his concern that he 'will not live to see my children grow up'. But he maintained that he would not become a 'born-against Christian', embarking on a 32-show tour. Little has been disclosed about the nature of Parfitt's condition today, although a spokesman said the band will release more information on his condition when it is known next week. The band's manager Simon Porter said: 'The band do not cancel shows lightly, as any of our fans will tell you, but in this instance we have no option but to follow medical advice.' It is not known whether or not the band's UK tour, scheduled for December, will be affected. The band's dates in Monte Carlo, Switzerland and Germany - up until August 10 - have been cancelled on medical advice. Within minutes of the statement being issued, fans from all over the world were flooding forums, Twitter and the official Facebook page with messages of concern. Many were consulting photos of him at their latest gig in Austria, remarking that he looked 'tired'. One wrote on a forum: 'Always makes me nervous reading stuff life this, hope he's ok', while another said: 'All the best from me. I saw you play when you cam to Swindon in 1990.' And one well-wisher said: 'Hope he will bounce back like he has in the past. Get well soon Rick.' Some fans speculated he may be suffering from sunstroke or heat exhaustion in the summer heat wave across mainland Europe. On the band's Facebook page, a fan wrote: 'Get well soon Rick! Best wishes from Argentina!' Scroll down for video . Cancelled: The next eight days of shows in Germany, Monte Carlo, Switzerland and Croatia are cancelled . Concern: Fans took to Twitter this afternoon to express their concern for the guitarist's wellbeing. Above, user Johnny Main wrote: 'Not good news. Hope it's nothing serious' Fan: Sally Newhouse said: 'Get well quick #RickParfitt - #StatusQuo and the world of #rock #music needs you' Another said: 'Every good wish to you, yours and the band. Health must come first, hope to see you fit and well in Leeds'. Fans also took to Twitter this afternoon to express their concern for the guitarist's wellbeing. User Johnny Main wrote: 'Not good news. Hope it's nothing serious', while Sally Newhouse said: 'Get well quick #RickParfitt - #StatusQuo and the world of #rock #music needs you.' Another user simply wrote: 'Terrible news.' In 1997,  doctors warned Parfitt that he could die at any time following a hard-living lifestyle involving drink and drugs. Parfitt says that he is still able to perform for hours but struggles to keep up with his son playing football . Distraught: The band's strong fan base across mainland Europe has been left distraught by the cancellation . Chris Smith wrote: 'Love and best wishes to Rick #StatusQuo for a speedy recovery. Keep on rocking Rick and get back on stage soon to wow us as you always do' Even after the life-saving surgery, the guitarist said he still enjoyed the 'odd pint'. But after his scares, he insists he now never spends more than three weeks away from his family while touring with the band in order to spend as much time with his children as possible. His 54-year-old wife Lyndsay underwent gruelling IVF treatment in order to become pregnant five years ago, and they now have twins Tommy and Lily. Speaking to the Mail last November, he said: ‘It upsets me to think that I won’t see them fully grow up. 'I probably won’t. Even if I live to 80, they will just about be 20. I would love to see them get to 21. Family: Parfitt never spends more than three weeks away from wife Lyndsay and their five-year-old sons . Still performing: The rock band, pictured in the 1960s, were due to kick off a 32-date tour with their Croatia gig tonight. Despite having a quadruple heart bypass in 1997, Parfitt (second left) vowed to enjoy himself . ‘It frightens the life out of me when I think I’m not going to see them grow up, and to see what they do and what they become. 'I know it’s morbid, but I’m only being realistic. I won’t be around. ‘That really scares me. I’m going to try and do as much as I can. 'I’m going to travel with them and take them to Disneyland. 'I want to be able to see their faces when they see that sort of thing. And just be with them as much as I can. I won’t go away for more than three weeks now.’ Status Quo currently hold the record for the most British singles, at 64.","Rick Parfitt, 65, hospitalised, forcing band to cancel six of 32 shows .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail online Deputy Political Editor . Former Education Secretary Michael Gove warned of the danger of letting school pupils be radicalised . Hardline Islamists involved in a ‘Trojan Horse’ plot to radicalise pupils are still working in Birmingham schools, a teaching union boss has claimed. Rob Kelsall, of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the union was investigating 28 secret deals with school principals - amid fears that some may have been forced out of their jobs unfairly by radical governors. The union said at least three so-called 'compromise agreements' had ‘all the hallmarks of Trojan Horse pressures’. Mr Kelsall’s remarks came as a former headteacher of a school implicated in the Trojan Horse plot was reinstated. Ms Bhupinder Kondal returned as principal of Oldknow Academy in Small Heath - the school she left in January after claiming she had been undermined by those trying to impose a narrow Muslim ethos. Governors implicated in the government report into the Trojan Horse scandal – compiled by former Scotland Yard counter terror chief Peter Clarke – have either been removed or forced to resign. But the head teachers’ union chief Rob Kelsall today revealed he was worried others involved in the plot had gone unnoticed. He said: ‘I remain concerned that there are still people not named in Peter Clarke’s report still operating in Birmingham schools.’ But he added: ‘I have more confidence that complaints will be taken seriously.’ Mr Kelsall called on Birmingham city council to act on the cases of three head teachers allegedly ousted by Trojan Horse plotters. Scroll down for video . Governors at Satley School were accused of  'refusing to accept that the school is in a state of crisis' while governors at Oldknow Academy used the school's budget to subsidise a trip to Saudi Arabia for only Muslim staff and pupils. The Golden Hillock School and Nansen Primary School were both branded 'inadequate' in the new inspections . Speaking on her return to Oldknow, Ms Bhupinder Kondal said it was ‘like getting a new job.’ ‘I am glad to be back doing the job I love,’ she said. ‘The pressures outlined in the Trojan Horse letter are very real and it mustn’t be allowed to happen again.’ The Department for Education said a decision to stop funding the school in the light of the Trojan Horse inquiry is now likely to be reversed. A Birmingham City Council spokesperson said: ‘There are no current legal proceedings from head teachers, though we are in continued dialogue with the NAHT and are reviewing key cases as recommended by the Ian Kershaw review.’","Hardliners allegedly infiltrated school governing bodies to radicalise pupils .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail online Deputy Political Editor . Ukip leader Nigel Farage has finally confirmed he will stand in the Kent constituency of Thanet South in next year’s general election. Mr Farage said he had thrown his ‘hat in the ring’, ending months of speculation that he was lining up the South East constituency as his target for the 2015 contest. Mr Farage insisted it was not a certainty that he would be selected by the local party but added: ‘I think I stand a good chance of winning.’ Nigel Farage has ended months of speculation over where he will stand in the 2015 general election after announcing he would fight to get UKIP's nomination to be the candidate in South Thanet . Mr Farage was born in Kent and has represented the area in the European Parliament since 1999. The Tory incumbent Laura Sandys won the South Thanet seat with a majority of 7,617 in 2010 but is standing down at the general election. Ukip performed particularly strongly in Kent in this year's European elections. The anti-EU party has also won a string of local council seats in Kent. A survey last month by Lord Ashcroft, the Tory millionaire, suggested Ukip was on course to capture Thanet South from the Conservatives at the election. He also said the party could win the Essex seat of Thurrock and come second in Great Yarmouth in Norfolk. In his column in The Independent Mr Farage said: ‘The situation is that there will be a hustings in the constituency the week after next at which the branch will decide who they wish to represent them. ‘I have thrown my hat in the ring, but so have others, including a top-class barrister and friend of mine. ‘It may seem silly to some that the leader of a party would have to go through the process of being approved and selected but, I assure you, rank means nothing in Ukip.' Tory MP for Thanet South Laura Sandys (left), the granddaughter of wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill, is not standing next election. The prospect of Nigel Farage in Parliament is dreaded by David Cameron . Mr Farage added: ‘Just as I applied to stand again as a Ukip MEP and went through the same assessment as other candidates and faced the vote of the membership with everyone else, I believe that the power to select the person they will be pounding the streets in all weathers for lies with the members of the branch themselves. ‘Of course I think I stand a good chance of winning. I have fought the seat before and it is in my home county of Kent and an area I have represented in the European Parliament since 1999. But with Ukip members, nothing is ever for certain. And that’s just fine by me.’ A senior Ukip source said Mr Farage was one of eight candidates on the shortlist for the seat.","UKIP leader ends months of speculation over where he will stand next year .

"By . Alex Lazcano For Daily Mail Australia . Australia's first pizza vending machine has landed in Sydney, and the $12 treats have been such a hit the owner is already thinking about rolling more machines out. The brains behind the $40,000 Pizza Gio is George Pompei, who owns Pompei's pizza and pasta restaurant in Bondi Beach. He was inspired when he was traveling in Italy and came across a similar concept. Scroll down for video . George Pompei (pictured left) owner of Pompei's a pizza restaurant in Bondi launches Australia's first pizza vending machine in Westfield Chatswood. Mr Pompei admits he was sceptical at first, concerned that a machine wouldn't be able to produce a pizza that met the high standards he was used to at his restaurant. 'I wanted to be assured that the machine could actually develop pizzas that tasted fresh and delicious,' Mr Pompei told Daily Mail Australia. However after nearly two years of developing the machine and months of rigorous testing he finally had a product that was up to the task. 'Once the machine was developed it took six months of testing until we were happy with the product,' he explained. 'We use stone ground flour, natural yeast, extra virgin olive oil and sea salt and rest the dough for 48 hours before it is then rolled out and topping is added.' The options for the $12 pizza are Hot Salami and Margarita however more flavours are on there way with an addition of a second machine being introduced . Order your pizza in three simple steps using the touch-screen monitor then wait three minutes for your pizza. The pizzas are par-baked in a stone oven before being blast chilled and stocked in the vending machines. They take three minutes to cook and customers can choose from either hot salami or margarita toppings. And if you're concerned that the pizzas are sitting in the vending machines gathering dust, there's no need to worry. The machine is restocked daily and if it sells out before the day's end, a message is sent to Mr Pompei's restaurant who will then send someone to top it up. The Pizza Gio has been so popular in Chatswood there are plans to open another one with alternative toppings. But pizza lovers around Sydney don't need to worry that they're missing out for much longer. Mr Pompei hopes to roll out more vending machines across the city. The pizza machine is restocked with fresh bases and toppings daily to ensure freshness. Despite his assurances that the 3 minute pizzas are as good as those you can buy in his restaurant, he doesn't see the Pizza Gio as a threat. 'They're aimed more at people wanting something to eat on the go rather than someone wanting a proper meal.' 'We've been overwhelmed with the support we've gotten. We're thinking of actually having a competition so that people can tell us where they'd like the next machine to be put,' Mr Pompei said.","George Pompei has launched Australia's first pizza vending machine .

"By . Alex Lazcano For Daily Mail Australia . and Cindy Tran For Daily Mail Australia . A prison guard found guilty of helping smuggle drugs into prison and illegally accessing the information of prisoners under her care has applied to take her six-month-old baby boy to prison with her. Sarah Dawn Rudd, 26, from Alice Springs in Central Australia, pleaded guilty to a string of charges while she was working as a guard at Berrimah prison in Darwin. The charges involved a corrupt ring of prisoners, a police officer, and outlaw motorcycle gangs, which traded in the confidential information about prisoners and the supply of drugs. Rudd and her partner, firefighter Anthony Butt,45, was also involved in the syndicate. If sentenced to prison, Sarah Dawn Rudd wants to take her baby to do time with her. Northern Territory Supreme Court Justice Jenny Blokland asked correctional services about the possibility of Rudd's child living with her in the new correctional centre, which is under construction in rural Darwin. Rudd held the baby in her arms and breastfed while she faced trial last week, according to NT News. Crown prosecutor David Morters told the court that Corrections boss Ken Middlebrook confirmed women with babies would be accommodated at the new jail. 'The new jail will support the provision of services to young children,' he said. The former prison guard has pleaded guilty to a dozen of charges after her involvement in a crime ring operating outside of a Darwin prison. She pleaded guilty to several drug charges, as well as convincing a colleague to illegally access confidential information on other prisoners on the Corrections database. A pre-sentencing report has been ordered  to see the likelihood that a new correctional facility will be able to house former prison guard Sarah Dawn Rudd and her six-month-old son. Sarah Dawn Rudd pleaded guilty to several drug charges and convinced a colleague to illegally access information on other prisoners on the Corrections database . Her partner and co-offender, Anthony Butt, who is a firefighter, supported her in court. The couple were both charged in May last year for possessing steroids from a trip to Thailand. Her barrister Jon Tippett QC said his client had a hard time working as a guard and began using drugs – before she was arrested with ecstasy pills and 1.5g of the drug ice in her undies during a drug deal at Le Cornu, Winnellie. The court heard how Ms Rudd told a woman name Zayley Ainslie how to smuggle cannabis past patrolling dogs for her prison boyfriend Phillip Noel Kaye, who was also Ms Rudd's alledged drug dealer. Ms Rudd had been working at the Darwin Correctional Centre for four years when she was arrested in a police sting, Operation Moonraker, in June last year. Justice Jenny Blokland said the harm was in compromising the integrity of Corrections, according to NT News. It is believed that Ms Rudd had committed 12 crimes between March and June 2013. An aerial shot of Berrimah prison where Sarah Dawn Rudd worked as a prison guard. Crown prosecutor David Morters told the court she used fellow guard Dwayne Reichelt to access confidential information to find out if her alleged drug dealer Mr Kaye who was already arrested when she tried contacting him. She also passed messages from prisoner Jared Davis, a Rebels bikie, to James Hau, who was arrested with 14 guns that former navy sailor Matthew Evans stole from a patrol boat at Larrakeyah, telling him that Davis wanted him to organise cannabis supply to the prison through Kaye, according to NT News. She also told Hau what evidence Mr Davis wanted him to give about the firearms. Prosecutor Morters said Mr Hau had planned to trade the guns to the Rebels in exchange for “dangerous drugs”. 'These offences constitute a serious undermining of the criminal justice system,' prosecutor Morters said. 'It's a significant breach of trust to be participating in the supply of drugs into a correctional facility.' Barrister Tippett said Justice Jenny Blokland should be lenient in sentencing her because none of the charges resulted in any serious harm. 'She had been a prison officer who had (always) stuck to her ethical and professional responsibilities in the past and along came a period of significant uncertainty (and) emotional upheaval,' he said. The sentencing case continues.","The Northern Territory's Supreme Court ordered a pre-sentence report for disgraced prison guard Sarah Dawn Rudd .

Three men are charged with digging up the cremated remains of two relatives and moving them to another cemetery in Maine (stock image) Three men are charged with digging up the cremated remains of two relatives and moving them to another cemetery in Maine.

Police say the men dug up the remains of Richard Lewis and his son - who shared the same name - from a cemetery in Standish last fall, then reburied them in the family plot in Limington. The elder Richard Lewis was Calvin Lewis' brother and the father of the other two men. The remains were returned to their original resting place on August 2. It . was the former girlfriend of the younger Richard Lewis - also the . mother of his children - who alerted the Cumberland County Sheriff’s . Office about the ashes being moved.

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail online Deputy Political Editor . The Queen may be forced to appoint an Australian-style ‘governor general’ to rule in her name in Scotland if the country votes for independence next month, it has been claimed. Constitutional experts fear independence could throw up divided loyalties for the Queen if there was a clash between Scotland and the rump-UK in the future. One solution would be to appoint a ‘governor general’ in Edinburgh to act in the Queen’s name. This could lead Scotland to eventually ditching the Royal family and becoming a republic within the European Union, claim experts. The Queen - inspecting the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders at the gates to Balmoral earlier this month - may have divided loyalties if Scotland voted for independence . Latest polls show support for independence has grown from 39 per cent to 43 per cent in a month, with just four weeks before the historic September 18 referendum . Sir Peter Cosgrove was sworn in as Australia’s twenty sixth Governor-General in March this year. The retired senior army officer represents the Queen in Australia and is the Commander-in-Chief of the country’s Defence Force. In the day-to-day running of the country the Governor-General acts as the country’s head of state and is appointed by The Queen on the advice of the Australian Prime Minister. Like the Queen in the UK, the Governor-General has the power to appoint a Prime Minister if an election has resulted in a ‘hung parliament’. He also has the power to dismiss a Prime Minister where he or she has lost the confidence of the Parliament. The claim comes as a new poll shows rising support for independence with just a month to go before the referendum on September 18. A YouGov poll for the Times puts support for independence at 43 per cent, with 57 per cent backing the Union, once undecided voters are taken out. Earlier this month just 39 per cent said they were preparing to vote Yes - with 61 per cent for No. Scottish Nationalist leader Alex Salmond has insisted that the Queen will remain head of state in an independent Scotland. But his party is split on the issue. The SNP’s John Mason yesterday called for a referendum to replace the Queen as head of state in Scotland. He said: ‘The present queen is very popular, but the mood of society may change when she leaves the throne.’ Scotland Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill has also raised the prospect this year of a referendum on the Royals. He said it was ‘for the people of Scotland to decide’ on the Queen’s role. However, Robert Blackburn, professor of constitutional law at King’s College London, said the Queen may need to change her role if the UK split. He said: ‘Politically, the Queen could find herself in difficulties if she received contradictory advice on her royal duties or public utterances on matters of common interest, particularly in foreign or diplomatic matters, where the British and Scottish governments might happen to be at loggerheads. ‘One solution would be to establish an office of governor-general in Edinburgh to act in the Queen’s name.’ Stephen Haseler, director of the Global Policy Institute in London, added: ‘Alex Salmond has overcome the issue of the monarchy initially by saying “Look, we will keep the Queen”.' But Mr Haseler added: 'But of course the Queen won’t be around for very long, and my absolute conviction is that once the Queen goes the Scots won’t wear Prince Charles, and they will go for a republican system within the European Union.’ The Queen has not intervened in the debate on independence, but has previously publicly praised the union. Earlier this month the Queen conferred the honour of Knight of the Order of Australia on the country's  Governor-General, Sir Peter Cosgrove. Sir Peter represents the Queen in Australia and is the head of the Australian defence force . First Minister Alex Salmond has vowed to keep the Queen as Scotland's head of state after independence . In a speech she gave to MPs on her Silver Jubilee in 1977 she said: ‘I number kings and queens of England and of Scotland, and princes of Wales among my ancestors and so I can readily understand these aspirations. ‘But I cannot forget that I was crowned Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. ‘Perhaps this jubilee is a time to remind ourselves of the benefits which union has conferred, at home and in our international dealings, on the inhabitants of all parts of this United Kingdom.’","Experts fear independence could throw up divided loyalties for the Queen .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail online Deputy Political Editor . Veteran Labour MP Austin Mitchell was elected MP for Great Grimsby in 1977 but will step down at the next election . A veteran Labour MP has claimed the 'problem' with female politicians is that they care too much about issues which are relevant to ordinary people. Austin Mitchell, the Labour MP for Grimsby, said the increasing number of women in the Commons would be 'less inclined to discuss the big issues'. His remarks, on the BBC's Woman's Hour this morning, sparked fury and calls for the Labour leader Ed Miliband to make it clear he disagrees. It comes after Mr Mitchell this weekend claimed that the growing number of female MPs in the Labour party was making it too ‘gentle’ to wield power after the next election. Mr Mitchell, 79, said he was worried about the falling number of experienced men in the party because the party will be full of ‘amenable and leadable’ women obsessed with feminism. The Labour MP, who is stepping down at the next election, said Labour was becoming more ‘family-friendly, gentler’ but ‘less prepared for all-night shenanigans of the parliamentary kind’. Speaking today, Mr Mitchell attempted to explain his remarks. He said: 'I think the problem is simply this, that parliament with more women is going to be more anxious to discuss issues relevant to the people, that is to say family issues, social issues. 'And less inclined to discuss big issues like should we invade Iraq.' But Tory Defence Minister Anna Soubry dismissed the remarks. She said: 'Austin Mitchell’s at it again, talking nonsense and insulting women with his absurd theories. To say that women don’t care about the big issues is just not true. 'Ed Miliband should make it absolutely clear he doesn’t agree with Mitchell’s ridiculous remarks.' Mr Mitchell said the parliamentary Labour party was undergoing ‘the biggest process of feminisation and rejuvenation embarked on since fabulous pink Camay soap promised to make us look a little lovelier each day’. But he added: ‘Whatever the state of Labour’s policies for the next Election, there is little doubt that it will be fought by a younger, more attractive body of candidates. Almost half of Labour's cabinet are women and Ed Miliband is understood to want to hit 50 per cent by the next election - up from 44 per cent today. Labour's leading women, pictured here, from left back row: Caroline Flint, Angela Eagle, Maria Eagle, Rosie Winterton, Emily Thornberry, Margaret Curran, Baronness Royall. Front row: Rachel Reeves, Liz Kendal, Harriet Harman, Yvette Cooper, Mary Creagh and Tessa Jowell . Labour introduced all women shortlists in 1993 and has since seen a surge in the number of female MPs - 81 out of 257. But Mr Mitchell said all-women shortlists were being imposed on regions such as Yorkshire and the North as a form of punishment ‘for their earlier male chauvinism’. He said: ‘If Labour wins in 2015, how a family-friendly, gentler party, less prepared for all-night shenanigans of the parliamentary kind, will face up to Tory hooligans who feel they’ve been unjustly deprived of a power that’s their due, is a more worrying matter.’","Women MPs 'less inclined to discuss big issues, says Austin Mitchell .

"By . Leon Watson . A couple are counting their blessings after their baby survived being born seemingly without blood and white as a 'ghost'. Hope Juarez, who was born at a hospital in Irvine, California, suffered from a rare condition that meant when she was born 80 per cent of her blood had drained out of her body. It left her looking disturbingly pale and when doctors brought her to draw blood for tests, they could barely get a drop. White as a sheet: Hope Juarez, who was born at a hospital in Irvine, California . Now aged six weeks, Hope Juarez suffered from a rare condition that meant when she was born 80 per cent of her blood had drained out of her body . The baby's father, Josh Juarez said: 'She was crying and they brought her over to us and she was really pale. 'I knew that something was really wrong when they started pricking at her feet trying to get blood to come out and there was no blood coming out.' Dr Marielle Nguyen, a neonatologist at Kaiser Permanente, Irvine Medical Center, explained: 'She probably lost about 80 per cent or more. She was pale. She was really white.' Doctors performed an emergency C-section six weeks ago. Her only hope for survival was a blood transfusion, ABC Local reported. Speaking about her pregnancy, mother Jennifer Juarez, 27, said: 'She would kick around 10 times within half an hour, which is a lot.' But three weeks before her due date, the kicking stopped. She went to her midwife. Relieved: Hope with her parents Jennifer and Josh . Hope had been kicking away healthily in the womb before it suddenly stopped . Doctors saved Hope's life by giving her a blood transfusion and she's now a healthy six-week-old baby . 'She asked me, ""Well what's your gut feeling?"" And I said, ""I don't know. I just feel like something's off. Something's not right,""' said Jennifer. Hope suffered from a fetal-maternal hemorrhage. The only other known recent case of a so-called 'ghost white baby' surviving at birth occurred in the UK in 2012. There were similar circumstances. The mother in that case also noticed her daughter had stopped kicking. Slight loss of fetal blood occurs in 98 per cent of pregnancies, but hardly ever to this degree and rarely do babies survive. 'We don't know what causes it. A lot of it is just it happens spontaneously. Sometimes the cause could be a motor vehicle accident, trauma, or where we have placental rupture, where the placenta suddenly just comes off the uterine wall,' Dr Nguyen told ABC Local. None of that happened to Jennifer, so why Hope lost all her blood is unknown. How to prevent fetal-maternal hemorrhage is unknown, too. Doctors said the mother saved her daughter's life because she noticed when her baby stopped kicking and got medical attention right away. If she had waited, even just an hour or two, doctors say Hope would not be alive today.","Hope Juarez, from California, suffered from fetal-maternal hemorrhage .

"By . James  Nye . Drug store giant CVS Caremark announced on Wednesday that it will not sell tobacco products anymore across its 7,600 pharmacies nationwide by October 1 - in a move which has drawn praise from President Obama and first lady, Michelle Obama. The country's second largest drugstore sells $1.5 billion in tobacco each year, but CVS has said that selling cigarettes while selling prescriptions that deal with their effects does not make sense. 'Selling tobacco is very inconsistent with being in that business,' said Helena Foulkes, CVS's president. 'We really thought about this decision as it relates to the future as a health company — it's good for customers and our company, in the long run.' Scroll down for video . No more smokes: CVS has announced that its pharmacies will no longer sell cigarettes any longer from October 1 . Public health experts called the decision by the No. 2 U.S. drugstore chain a precedent-setting step that could pressure other stores to follow suit. CVS, whose Caremark unit is a major pharmacy benefits manager for corporations and the government Medicare program, believes the decision will strengthen its position as a healthcare provider.President Barack Obama, a former smoker who tried for years to stop, immediately praised CVS, saying in a statement that their powerful example 'will help advance my Administration's efforts to reduce tobacco-related deaths, cancer, and heart disease, as well as bring down health care costs — ultimately saving lives and protecting untold numbers of families from pain and heartbreak for years to come.' The first lady — who encouraged her husband to kick the habit — quickly chimed in by saying, 'Thanks CVS, now we can all breathe a little easier, and our families can live healthier.' 'I think it will put pressure on other retailers who want to be in healthcare,' said CVS Caremark Chief Medical Officer Dr. Troyen Brennan. Although some U.S. cities, including Boston and San Francisco, already ban the sale of tobacco products in pharmacies, advocates hope CVS' voluntary decision will have a ripple effect among other pharmacy chains. First lady's approval: Michelle Obama tweeted this in response to CVS's decision to stop selling all tobacco products by October 1 across the nation . Marlboro cigarettes are on display in a CVS store in Pittsburgh. The nation's second-largest drugstore chain says it will phase out cigarettes, cigars and chewing tobacco by Oct. 1 as it continues to focus more on health care . Some retailers stopped selling cigarettes years ago: Target Corp decided to drop them in 1996, while East Coast supermarket chain Wegmans Food Markets did so in 2008. Speaking to USA today, Foules said that CVS sees its future more as an alternative to a doctor's - with 26,000 pharmacists advising customers how to deal with their health problems. 'Any form of tobacco use makes those chronic conditions more difficult to deal with,' she said. 'This is good for business and the right thing to do.' Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, which advocates for tobacco control, said that CVS's announcement could drive momentum for declining tobacco use. Dr. Risa Lavizzo-Mourey, chief executive officer of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which focuses on public health, called CVS' decision 'a bold, precedent-setting move because it acknowledges that pharmacies have become healthcare settings.' While headline grabbing, CVS said the move will not make a big dent in its profits. CVS said it will lose about $2 billion in annual sales and between 6 and 9 cents of profit per share this year. Analysts expect the company to report 2014 revenue of $132.9 billion and a profit of $4.47 per share, according to Thomson Reuters. CVS Caremark Corp said on Wednesday that it would stop selling tobacco products at its 7,600 stores by October, becoming the first U.S. drugstore chain to take cigarettes off the shelf . As the Affordable Care Act is implemented, it's important to help people stay healthy, said Troy Brennan, the company's chief medical officer. 'It's expensive to provide health care for all the people through the ACA,' U.S. cigarette sales have fallen 31.3 percent between 2003 and 2013, according to Euromonitor International. The falling smoking rates, along with new competition in the last two years from the low-cost Family Dollar Stores Inc and Dollar General Corp chains, suggest shrinking prospects for tobacco product sales at CVS. Dollar stores have far more locations and offer goods at lower prices. Although adult smoking rates have fallen from 43 percent of Americans in 1965 to the current 18 percent, smoking remains the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, killing more than 480,000 people each year. Some retailers stopped selling cigarettes years ago: Target Corp decided to drop them in 1996, while East Coast supermarket chain Wegmans Food Markets did so in 2008 . Last month, the American Lung Association and other advocacy organizations called on political leaders to commit to cutting smoking rates to less than 10 percent of the population in a decade and to protect all Americans from secondhand smoke within five years. The CVS decision comes on the heels of several recent deals bolstering CVS Caremark's position in the healthcare market. CVS in December said it expected its pharmacy benefit manager revenues to rise between 7.25 percent and 8.5 percent in 2014, easily outpacing growth of 2 percent to 3.25 percent in its retail business. In December, CVS and pharmaceutical distributor Cardinal Health Inc announced a 10-year agreement to form the largest generic drug sourcing operation in the United States. A month earlier it said it was buying Coram LLC, Apria Healthcare Group Inc's specialty infusion services business unit. CVS executives said the company will replace some of lost cigarette sales through smoking cessation programs at its pharmacies and will offer more programs to Caremark members. CVS said the programs will be also be a key selling point as it tries to land more corporate contracts this year.","CVS Caremark is kicking the habit of selling tobacco products at its more than 7,600 drugstores nationwide .

"By . Emma Innes . and Amanda Williams . A teenager with incurable cancer who has raised more than £3 million for charity - and was this morning praised by the Prime Minister - has been discharged from hospital. Stephen Sutton, 19, was being treated for multiple tumours at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital and was recently pictured giving his 'final thumbs up' from his hospital bed - convinced that he would not make it out. But Stephen has announced on Facebook that he has now been discharged after a 'quite remarkable' recovery. Scroll down for video . Stephen Sutton, 19, was being treated for multiple tumours at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital and was recently pictured giving his 'final thumbs up' from his hospital bed - convinced that he would not make it out . Mr Cameron has tweeted a link to Stephen's Just Giving page, where he is raising money for the Teenage Cancer Trust, urging people to donate, saying: 'An honour to meet @-StephensStory today - his courage is an inspiration to all of us.' On Facebook, Stephen wrote: 'I then also have some more great news...I've been discharged from hospital!! 'After being at a point where it seemed like I'd never make it out it feels so awesome to be able to put that. The recovery I've undergone recently is quite remarkable. 'It has been difficult, there is an emotional trauma attached to nearly dying (a few times) that will take a while to get used to, but ultimately I now feel even more fortunate to just be here and the experience serves as a potent reminder to go out there and live life as freely and as positively as possible. 'The simple things we take for granted are all blessings, and living truly is a privilege we should all try and enjoy and make the most of!' In a later post, he thanked the numerous celebrities who had backed his campaign - and that he was still struggling to comprehend its success. He wrote: 'I also had the support from a number of high profile celebrities, which was also greatly appreciated and particularly hugely helped the fundraising push. Thumbs up: Cancer patient Stephen Sutton with Prime Minister David Cameron who visited him at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham today . 'Jason Manford was one of the main protagonists in it and I'm hugely greatly for the work he did and is continuing to do- he visited me twice in hospital and was very genuine and lovely both times. 'The lovely Tim Minchin also responded by writing me a song (to tick another item off my bucketlist), Skrillex sent a personal video message, amongst other examples of celebrities doing some good. 'Ultimately over £3million pound has been raised for Teenage Cancer trust which is just staggering… I can still barely get my head round it… just thank you to EVERYONE.' He added he was attempting to respond to hundreds of messages he had been sent - but was struggling to keep up. He added: 'A lot of people want to visit me. As mentioned I am still physically recovering and as much I'd love to, it would not be viable for me to spend time with everyone who wants to see me. 'I know that everyone means well, but I do need to rest, so direct phonecalls or unexpected visits to my home will not really be appropriate at the moment.' Mr Cameron was pictured holding a message encouraging people to donate to Stephen Sutton’s campaign. He visited the 19-year-old bowel cancer patient - whose condition has improved in the last week - at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham this morning. David Cameron (pictured with radio presenters John Fox and Giuliano Casadei) has lent his support to the fundraising efforts of Stephen Sutton . Mr Cameron described Stephen as ‘an inspiration’ and asked people to continue to help him in his quest to raise as much money as possible for the Teenage Cancer Trust. The Prime Minister also appeared on the Birmingham-based Free Radio where he told listeners: ‘[Stephen] is an amazing guy. When you watch his YouTube video it’s one of the most amazing things you will see. He is an inspiration. He is an inspirational Briton.’ During . Mr Cameron's visit, lasting around 15 minutes, Stephen, whose . fund-raising for the Teenage Cancer Trust has won backing from people . around the world, posed for pictures alongside the Prime Minister, his . mother Jane and the consultant treating him. Stephen, . from Burntwood, Staffordshire, has raised more than £3.1 million in . donations from 131,000 people since posting Stephen's Story, a film . about his bucket list, on the internet. Mr . Cameron, who gave Stephen a letter saying he was humbled by his bravery . and positive attitude, had previously missed out on meeting the . teenager when he visited Downing Street to tick off an item on his . bucket list last year. After visiting the ward where Stephen is being cared for, Mr Cameron said: 'He's amazing, just an inspiration. 'Anyone . who watches that video on YouTube just can't help but be impressed by . his bravery and courage but also his incredible warmth and passion for . life. 'It really is extraordinary.' Stephen was diagnosed with bowel cancer when he was just 15. He had surgery to remove a tumour but the cancer returned a year later and he was told that it was incurable . Stephen . said he has discussed the possibility of trying a new trial drug . treatment, which would be his fifth regime of chemotherapy. However, for the time being Stephen said he and his family aimed to 'Just get a bit of normality back into our lives'. He added: 'This extra period of time I now have feels like a gift, one that I'm determined to use productively. 'I'll be probably be straight back to doing some crazy stuff/events/etc soon, but for now, it just feels great to be home!!' Speaking to Birmingham-based Free Radio, Mr Cameron added: 'He's actually been to Downing Street but sadly I wasn't there. 'One of the things on his bucket list was to make a speech in Downing Street. 'When you watch that YouTube video, it's one of the most inspiring things you will ever see. 'Here's this guy who is fighting a disease but he's also got time to inspire hundreds of thousands of people.' In . his letter to Stephen, Mr Cameron said: 'I wanted to write to say how . inspiring it has been to watch the progress of your campaign. Stephen has been helped in his fundraising efforts by the comedian Jason Manford. Mr Manford held a sell-out last minute performance (pictured) to raise money for Stephen's fund . 'The way you have responded to such a difficult diagnosis is incredible; your bravery and positive attitude is truly humbling. 'You . have caught the attention of people around the world and helped raise . an enormous amount of money to support other teenage cancer sufferers. 'You have my admiration and gratitude for all that you have achieved.' Stephen, from Burntwood in Staffordshire, was diagnosed with colorectal cancer when he was just 15. He had surgery to remove a tumour but the cancer returned a year later and he was told it was incurable. When he learned that his cancer was terminal, Stephen wrote a bucket list of things he wanted to achieve before he died. Top of the list was to raise £10,000 for the Teenage Cancer Trust. His fundraising efforts were so successful that he soon upped the target to £1 million. However, two weeks ago his condition suddenly took a turn for the worse and he believed he had just days to live. At . this point, he was only about half way to his target so he launched a . social media campaign to encourage people to donate so he could achieve . his goal before he died. Dozens of celebrities, including Russell Brand, have posted messages of support on Twitter . His story went viral and within hours he had hit the £1 million target. With the help of the comedian Jason Manford he has continued to raise money from his hospital bed. The total currently stands at £3.1 million and Stephen’s Thumbs Up For Stephen campaign has seen dozens of celebrities from Russell Brand to Sir Chris Hoy and Piers Morgan post messages of support on Twitter. In the last two weeks Stephen’s condition has also improved. When he was taken to hospital two weeks ago tumours had caused one of his lungs to collapse and he was dependent upon breathing support. However, he had surgery yesterday and his condition has improved. Sir Chris Hoy has also encouraged people to help Stephen raise money for the Teenage Cancer Trust . Yesterday he told his Facebook followers: ‘This morning I had the operation and everything went well! ‘The aim was to remove anything nasty that was blocking my airway and maybe put a stent in. ‘There is still some tumour in my lung, but the surgeon is confident he has removed as much of the tumour from my airway as possible, so much so he thought putting the stent in wasn't necessary as my airway seemed to be pretty fully clear (which is great news). ‘The airway will need monitoring, but the outcome now is that my right lung may start to re-expand and my breathing generally stay functional for as long as possible!!’ To help Stephen in his fundraising.

"By . Jill Reilly . Controversial: Henry Armitage who wishes to exercise rights granted back in 1773 . A 'Lord of the Manor' has upset his neighbours in a Cumbrian village by suddenly deciding that he wants to exercise ancient rights granted back in 1773. Villagers in Preston Patrick were informed that that Henry Armitage and his mother Jennifer wanted to invoke a manorial right to ‘hunt, shoot and fish’ on their land. Nearly 700 letters have been sent out by the Land Registry after the Armitage's requested their so-called ‘profit-à-prendre (right to take.) This law legally entitles them to ‘a right . of hunting, hawking, fishing and fowling’ as well as 38 further stipulations known as 'Deeds . of Enfranchisement.' They include the right to extract minerals. One . resident, retired call centre manager Ian Woods said: 'The rights have . not been used for 200 years and the whole nature of the parish has . changed enormously. It’s totally inappropriate in this day and age. 'I’d like to know what this means. It’s worrying, especially if they also grant a right to extract minerals. Tony Mason, a teacher, said: 'I’m flabbergasted. 'It’s worrying that people are only . being given three weeks by the Land Registry to respond to the letters . with their objections.' Paper mill worker Dave Denney, said the letter had left him feeling ‘anger and annoyance’. 'I . think this is taking a liberty. I can only imagine they’ve gone to this . trouble because there’s some financial gain to be had.' The Preston Patrick rights were originally granted by Francis Charteris, of Horn-by Castle, to William Bateman, Thomas Cartmel, and Richard Wright, in 1773. Disputed land: Residents have reacted furiously after being informed that the Armitage family wanted to invoke an ancient manorial right to 'hunt, shoot and fish' on their land . Backdated: The manorial rights for Preston Patrick were acquired by Mr Armitage's great-grandfather, Thomas Pumphrey, when he bought Preston Patrick Hall from the Lowther family in the 1920s . Preston Patrick hall has been a Grade 2 listed building since 1952. The oldest part of the building is the hall block, which dates from the 14th century. The pele tower was added later, probably during the early part of the 15th century, and is the right hand wing of the photo. Records state that there was another tower on this site, and a curtain wall. There was a court room in the right hand tower, where local Quakers were tried in the early days of the breakaway religion. The name Preston Patrick is derived from 'Priest’s town' or 'Priest’s farm', and from Patrick de Curwen, an earlier owner of the manorial area. Thomas Machell (1680-1690s) describes it as 'an old rambling house with (a) slender tower ouer the Gate'. This may imply a gatehouse, in which case this may have been a courtyard house. An indenture from the time says the Deeds of Enfranchisement were purchased by the men for ‘three thousand and five hundred and thirteen pounds eight shillings and one penny half-penny’. The manorial rights for Preston Patrick were acquired by Mr Armitage’s great-grandfather, Thomas Pumphrey, when he bought Preston Patrick Hall from the Lowther family in the 1920s. Yesterday, Mr Armitage insisted the application had been made to prevent ‘long-held rights being lost’, and was ‘not a precursor to any greater use’ of them. Mr Armitage, of Kirkby Lonsdale, said: 'The current letters being sent out by the Land Registry reflect that we are reacting to the change in the law in order to protect an asset. 'The application being made is not a . precursor to any greater use of these long-held rights, and the reason . for the registration exercise is simply as a reaction to the change in . the law to prevent the rights being lost. 'Due . to the change, a large number of estates and other manorial owners are . actively undertaking similar exercises to register their rights prior to . October 2013. 'My mother Jennifer is in the process of transferring these rights to me.' Upset residents: From left to right - Ian Woods, David Denney and Tony Mason. Mr Denney said: 'I think this is taking a liberty. I can only imagine they've gone to this trouble because there's some financial gain to be had' Under the Land Registration Act 2002, the protected status of manorial rights will cease after October 2013, unless owners seek to register, or otherwise protect, them. The Land Registry yesterday confirmed an application had been received from the Armitages, and it was in the process of sending out letters to all property and land owners in Preston Patrick parish. Westmorland and Lonsdale MP Tim Farron has written to the Land Registry asking for an extension of the time limit for responses to give Preston Patrick residents a chance to organise a community response. He also wants all relevant documents to be made available for inspection in South Lakeland, rather than Plymouth.","Letters have been sent to 700 villagers in Preston Patrick, Cumbria, warning them that the Lord of the Manor wants to exercise ancient rights .

"By . Bianca London for MailOnline . She's been in the showbiz industry for years, gracing hundreds of red carpets and fronting the glossiest of fashion and beauty campaigns but Gwyneth Paltrow claims she's 'terrible' at beautifying herself. The mother-of-two, who always looks camera-ready, opened up about her hopeless beauty regime in her latest Goop post. 'Believe it or not, I am terrible at doing my own make-up,' writes the actress. 'I'm decent at doing it for a friend, but when it comes to my own face, I never get it right.' Scroll down for video . Going natural: Gwyneth Paltrow, pictured looking fresh-faced, has opened up about her beauty regime on her latest Goop post and is convinced that she's 'terrible' at doing her own make-up . The 41-year-old goes on to explain that she's been wanting a step-by-step lesson for ages so she asked her London make-up artist, Emma Lovell, to show her how. Sadly, camera-shy Gwynnie doesn't feature in the beauty tutorial. Instead, she asked one of her 'gorgeous school mum friends from my son Mosey's class' to be the model. Emma recreates the make-up she usually does for Gwyneth's daytime interviews and appearances and the star shares a step-by-step account to achieving the look at home. 'Before you start to think about applying make-up, it's important to take good care of your skin by cleaning and moisturising,' says Gwyneth. Before applying make-up, Emma always cleans the face and neck using a Clarisonic Blue Cleansing System and Nuxe Cleansing Water, she then spends a good few minutes blending in Nuxe's Créme Prodigeuse Day. 'One of Emma's many tips is to moisturise the entire neck, including the back; this keeps the front nice and taut,' adds Gwyneth. All glammed up: Gwyneth, 41, always looks polished. Her secret? She says before you start to think about applying make-up, it's important to take good care of your skin by cleaning and moisturising - followed by 21 products . Emma applies a few dabs of Jemma Kidd's Light As Air Foundation to the forehead, nose, cheeks, and chin and Jemma Kidd Wrinkle Rescue Serum and Brightener over the T-zone. 'Notice Emma puts the foundation on her hand first and uses her fingers to apply it and work it onto the skin. Always start from the centre and work outwards,' advises Gwyneth. Next is the EF|Studio Precision Lash Curler. 'This is Emma's one ""don't leave the house without it"" must. Always, always curl your lashes. As Emma says, it wakes up your face,' she emphasises. She also uses a creamy eyeshadow and dark brown mascara, which Gwyneth says is great for the daytime look. Another essential in Gwyneth's make-up regime is filling in her eyebrows with a light pencil before brushing them with a clean mascara wand. Natural glow: For the day time look, base wise, Emma applies a few dabs of Jemma Kidd's Light As Air Foundation to the forehead, nose, cheeks, and chin and Jemma Kidd Wrinkle Rescue Serum and Brightener over the T-zone . A creamy blusher, two hydrating lipsticks and a sweep of translucent powder make up the final touches. When Emma needs to transform Gwyneth's look from day to night, she usually only has 20 minutes to prepare, so she builds on the daytime make-up she'd already done. She enhances the look by using liquid eyeliner and a black mascara. To make the lips look fuller, she uses lip liner, a lip palette and gloss. She then swept Jemma Kidd's Dual Illuminator Crème Highlighter & Shimmer Dust over the cheekbones and set it with a translucent powder. 'To really liven up the look, Emma dabs shimmery eye shadow on the centre of the eyelid. Emma says there's nothing worse than a dry-looking eye! This shimmer makes you look glistening,' adds Gwyneth.

"By . Bianca London for MailOnline . Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears' matchy-matchy double denim look may have gone down as one of the biggest fashion faux pas in history but it seems that the style shocker is coming back to haunt us next season. Ralph Lauren has just unveiled its  Purple Label and Polo Ralph Lauren Spring 2015 collections and there's not one, but two double-denim suits - in fact, one includes a waistcoat, making it a triple denim ensemble. The menswear range includes a washed-out denim jacket and matching rolled-up boyfriend jeans, as well as the more sharply-cut dark denim suit with matching denim waistcoat. Dapper: . Lauren says his range is targeted at a 'very sophisticated guy with a . point of view who wants chic suits and sportswear' Double denim is back! Ralph Lauren has just unveiled its  Polo Ralph Lauren Spring 2015 collection and there's two denim on denim looks . Lauren, whose label is undergoing major global expansion, said his collection of sleek and modern silhouettes is targetted at a 'very sophisticated guy with a point of view who wants chic suits and sportswear.' 'This is a man's wardrobe,' he said of his double and single-breasted suits paired with high-collar shirts. 'The look is simple, beautiful and easy to wear. And it's stimulating the clothing business.' Back to haunt them: Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake demonstrate how not to do double denim back in 2001 - but were they just foreseeing the future of fashion? Here's how to do it: Kim Kardashian, left, and Miranda Kerr prove that you can pull off double denim and still look stylish . A-list fans: Kelly Brook, left, and Eva Mendes have recently been seen out trialling the double denim trend . While double denim has been seen as a fashion fail, like wearing socks with sandals (which had a moment this season), it seems fashion houses are keen to change our perception. This season saw Balmain, Louis Vuitton, and Joseph Altuzarra send out models swathed in denim and judging by Ralph Lauren's latest offering, the Marmite trend shows no sign of abating. While Kim Kardashian, Miranda Kerr and Eva Mendes have been trialling the trend, we haven't spotted any stylish male celebrities teaming their favourite jeans with a denim shirt...yet. Fashion blogger and founder of Want Her Wardrobe, Lydia Jones, said: ‘A few short years ago, wearing double denim was the most uncool thing ever but fashion bloggers and street stylistas changed that and it seems the big fashion houses and even the high street are slowly catching on. 'If you want to trial the trend but don't want to do a Justin and Britney, try wearing denim dungarees and then add a cropped denim jacket. 'Braver fashion fans can try out a denim shirt tucked loosely into high waisted jeans a la Miranda Kerr.' Fresh off the runway: Balmain - the label loved by Miranda Kerr and Kim Kardashian - sent models down the catwalk in Paris covered in denim for SS14 and it looks like the trend will gain momentum for next season .","Ralph Lauren Purple Label and Polo RL Spring '15 full of double denim .

Too young: 50-year-old celebrity mixologist Darryl Robinson (here with Dr. Oz) was found dead in his Brooklyn apartment Wednesday from unknown causes . 'At learning of this morning's sad news, our thoughts go out to Darryl Robinson's family & friends,' tweeted a Cooking Channel spokesperson Wednesday morning. Robinson appeared on his own show called Drink Up in which he taught viewers how to create simple but creative cocktails. After the show was not renewed after the 2010 season, Robinson made the television rounds with appearances alongside Wendy Williams, on VH1's Morning Buzz and on Access Hollywood. He really worked at making himself a brand and made a career out of it,' his friend Maggie Mistal told the New York Daily News. 'Everybody is just as shocked as I am. We’re all confused.' TV personality: Robinson had his own Cooking Channel show in 2010 called Drink Up. Though it was not renewed by the network after one season, the native Long Islander became known on the talk show circuit for his creative cocktails . Robinson was not classically trained in mixology and said on his website that all he knew he learned 'in the trenches.' For the native Long Islander, those trenches were--at least in part--in the once super trendy but now defunct Hudson Bar. Robinson's last post on his website was a Super Bowl mezcal cocktail on February 1. Autopsy results were still pending Wednesday afternoon.

"By . Bianca London for MailOnline . With a successful designer for a mother and a fashion icon father, the four Beckham children have an unmatched pedigree when it comes to style. So perhaps it should come as no surprise that the stylish six have been crowned the coolest celebrity clan in the world, courtesy of 28 per cent of those polled for a new survey. Snapping at their (beautifully shod) heels in second place were the Kardashians with 16 per cent of the vote, closely followed by the Knowles-Carter family. They shoot, they score! The Beckhams were named the most stylish celebrity clan on the planet . Fourth place was handed to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, with respondents citing Kate's impeccable dress sense and Prince George's immaculate ensembles. The Duke, however, didn't fare so well with his normcore uniform of jeans, polo shirts and pullovers resulting in their relatively lowly finish. Close behind the royal couple was the Wright family, made famous by reality TV show The Only Way Is Essex. Elliot, . Jess and the rest of the crew impressed voters with their savvy style nous - among them OAP Nanny Pat - which resulted in a 10 per cent share of the vote . and a fifth place finish. Stylish six:  28 per cent of those polled said the Beckhams were ahead of the game when it came to style . Keeping Up With The Beckhams! In second place were the Kardashians with 16 per cent of the vote . Hollywood superstar Will Smith and his brood came next taking sixth place with six per cent of the vote. According to those questioned, Will's impeccable suits combined with wife Jada Pinkett’s quirky  fashion sense equalled a very stylish couple. In seventh place was the second footballer on the list, Wayne Rooney, with respondents agreeing that wife Coleen had got the WAG look down to a tee. However, those polled did feel that Wayne was letting the side down with his uninspiring clothing choices, which resulted in a modest six per cent of the vote and a bottom half finish. Third place: Jay-Z, Beyonce and Blue Ivy were stylish enough to garner a top three finish in the poll . Letting the team down, Wills! Kate's style proved popular but the Duke's normcore staples weren't a hit . Hollywood style: Will Smith and his brood came next taking sixth place with six per cent of the vote . In eighth and ninth place were the Minogues closely followed by Rochelle and Marvin Humes who scored four and two per cent respectively. Glamourous football and fashion couple Peter Crouch and Abbey Clancy came in last with respondents awarding them one per cent of the vote. One woman who took part in the survey said: 'The Beckhams just have this effortless style that lots of people would die for. 'They all always look fabulous wherever they are - even the little ones. Clearly Victoria’s fashionista influence has paid off.' Making up the top ten: Rochelle and Marvin Humes scored two per cent and finished in ninth place . Another added: 'The Kardashians are the most stylish family for me. I love Kim’s quirky style, and her sisters always look great. 'Now that Kim has a little one I can’t wait to see what cute outfits she has lined up for her daughter to make front page news in.' A spokesperson for My1stYears, the company behind the survey, said: 'I think the respondents definitely have it right when crowning the most stylish family.

"By . Bianca London for MailOnline . We'd just about accepted collagen marshmallows and collagen drinks but the latest food packed with the anti-ageing ingredient might just be a step too far. Tokyo eatery, Zenyaren, serves a variety of the meaty treats, which have been designed to beat wrinkles. The grilled skewers of meat come in frozen blocks of collagen gelatin so they can be licked or crunched just like an ice lolly. Would you eat this all in the name of younger looking skin? A Tokyo eatery serves a variety of the meaty treats, which are packed with collagen and claim to beat wrinkles . This precious protein is the basic building block of the skin, forming mesh-like bonds to hold it firm and stop it sagging. When we are young, skin is made up of 80 per cent collagen. After the age of 25, we lose it at the rate of about one per cent a year. The result is the twin curses of wrinkles and saggy skin. Owners of the Zenyaren restaurant in the capital Tokyo - which invented the dish - say they have become massively popular during Japan's summer heatwave. Chefs prepare traditional skewers of chicken - known as yakitori - but then slowly freeze them in collagen blocks so they keep their freshly barbecued taste. Yum? Japanese skincare specialists believe by adding collagen into the diet via these bizarre meals, the effects of ageing can be slowed down but UK specialist aren't convinced . How do they work? This precious protein is the basic building block of the skin, forming mesh-like bonds to hold it firm and stop it sagging. A standard 'two lolly' serving costs just £ 2.50. Regular Koma Izuma, 47, said: 'It is delicious especially when you are trying to keep cool on a hot day. Refreshing and nutritious at the same time - and great for your complexion.' Japanese beauticians believe that eating collagen-rich foods keeps your skin young and wrinkle-free. Tokyo skin expert Tatsuto Tamura explains: 'This has been popular in Japan for generations although only now is it becoming mainstream and known in the West too. 'People here seek out collagen-enriched foods such as chicken, pigs' feet or shark fin because they believe it will help their skin,' he added. In the US, many restaurants now serve special 'wrinkle free' menus of dishes loaded with collagen. But the craze has not, however, impressed British skin specialists, and the British Skin Foundation claims that eating collagen does not benefit the skin in any way. Tasty? Chefs prepare traditional skewers of chicken - known as yakitori - but then slowly freeze them in collagen blocks so they keep their freshly barbecued taste . Cheap as chips: A standard two lolly serving costs £2.50 and fans say they're refreshing and nutritious at the same time . Laura Casewell, editor of The Cosmetic Surgery Guide, told the Mail: 'There's a definite move towards improving the skin from the ""inside out"" rather than the ""outside in"" and stimulating our bodies to replace what has been lost.' So can these meaty bites beat your crows feet? UK-based plastic surgeons and dermatologist aren't convinced. Mr Paul Banwell FRCS(Plast) from The Banwell Clinic, said: 'These collagen popsicles sound like a fun idea but unfortunately there is little scientific evidence to support their effectiveness. 'There are a myriad of more effective aesthetic facial treatments available from skilled surgeons and doctors and I would urge the public to seek tried and trusted methods of rejuvenation.' This isn't the first edible collagen to come onto the market. There have been various ranges of collagen-infused marshmallows and sweets that promise to 'reduce the appearance of cellulite, and firm and tone skin'. 'I haven't seen any strong evidence that explains why eating an increased amount of collagen should improve the quantity or quality of collagen in your skin,' says founder of 111SKIN, Dr Yannis Alexandrides. 'Collagen is a type of protein, and works with keratin to provide the skin with strength, smoothness and elasticity - however, it is effectively broken down in your stomach. There's no direct pathway to send collagen to the skin. 'I would suggest a following a healthy, balanced diet and exercise regime to optimise skin health and ensure that your body can manufacture collagen naturally. Can these make you young too?

"By . Bianca London for MailOnline . She beat Kim Kardashian and Rihanna to the best bikini body title and is partial to the odd midriff-baring selfie but Michelle Keegan maintains that she's got her insecurities just like everyone else. Speaking to MailOnline as she unveils her second collection for Lipsy, the soap star turned fashion designer said that scooping the bikini body award was 'very flattering' but she isn't as body confident as she may seem. 'I have body hang-ups just like every other girl,' she said. 'But I don't punish myself if I don't work out and I do everything in moderation so if I have a bad week foodwise, I'll ensure that I have a good one the next.' Scroll down for video . She's just like us! Michelle Keegan, pictured modelling her second colletion for Lipsy, may have an enviable body but she maintains that she has her hang-ups just like everyone else (jumpsuit, £75) Her fiance Mark Wright recently claimed that his fiancée doesn't diet and loves to eat Magnum ice-creams in bed - but judging by her super-svelte appearance in her new fashion campaign, we're not quite sure we believe him. So how does she do it? 'Lots of core work,' she revealed. 'I don't believe in crash diets or detoxes, I can't live like that. If I have a bad day then I'll have a good day the next.' Relaxed approach: Michelle says that while she does work out, she doesn't punish herself if she has a bad week (cami, £38) How will you wear yours?

'There's lots of lovely coats, fur jackets and sexy LBDs, which will be perfect for your Christmas parties.' When Michelle's debut range for Lipsy went on sale in early July, the hashtag #lipsylovemichelle became the number one trending topic on Twitter in the UK and remained in the top ten until the end of the day. So how does it feel? 'The response has been incredible and I am so happy that everyone loves it as much as I do,' she said.

Speaking about her design experience, she said: 'I learned a lot from my first time around and this time, I have gone with my instinct a lot more. I've made sure that every piece is something that I love and that I would wear myself. 'I was inspired by the catwalk but also the things I love to wear. A lot of the pieces are perfect for creating the layered look and there's lots of blazers that can be teamed with shorts, which you'll often find me wearing. 'I love the cami tops and I will be pairing them with a statement necklace,' she added. Leather look: Michelle says that this collection isn't as daring as her first and she's used her own style as the main inspiration behind it (dress, £65) Classic: Describing her own personal style, Michelle said: 'My style is quite classic.

"By . Katy Winter for MailOnline . With high-profile campaigns for Chanel and Agent Provocateur under her belt, Crystal Renn is one of today’s top models. However, the 28-year-old from Mississippi, hasn't had a straight trajectory to success. Her career began with drastic dieting, followed by years of anorexia - all in an effort to obtain the correct model proportions. It was only when she re-gained weight and entered the world of plus-size fashion that she truly found success. Speaking to the Telegraph, Crystal explains why she decided to write 'Hungry', which details her own battles with anorexia and her journey to body acceptance, . She says she wanted to encourage ‘people to question preconceived notions about what it means to be beautiful and the dangerous lengths some are willing to go to attain this.’ Scroll down for video . Crystal, here in a campaign shot for Mango, found her modelling career took off when she recovered from her eating disorder and gained weight . Crystal lost a staggering 42 per cent of her body weight after a model scout told her at age 14 that her Amazonian height and striking features meant she could be a model if she lost weight. ‘I wanted to tell the story of my life up until this point which included many tribulations to overcome,’ Renn told the Telegraph. ‘I had an unquenchable need to succeed at such a young age, to make something out of myself and to experience the world. I wanted. I know I used to have warped thinking but I changed and I wanted to help others change too. ‘Evolving my mindset opened me up to an entire world of possibilities and a peace that I had not previously known. So I felt I had to pass it on.’ Crystal walks the runway as the Z Spoke by Zac Posen spring 2011 collection . Crystal's story is particularly positive because, as well as recovering from her eating disorder she found success once she had reached a more healthy weight . Considering her time as a ‘normal size’ model was spent in misery, starving herself and frantically exercise to maintain her size 0-2 figure, it is little surprise that Crystal says the worst thing about modelling is ‘the lack of control’. Crystal’s story is particularly positive because, as well as recovering- beginning to eat again after realising she would die if she continued to starve herself- she found success once she had reached a more healthy weight. After years of anorexia, she regained the near 5st (32kg) she had lost. At a US size 12 (UK size 16), Crystal is hardly massive, but her beauty and presence have made her the go-to plus size model for high end designers. Having since fronted the  F/W 2010 Jean Paul Gautier campaign as well as appearing in campaigns for Mango, H&M, Zac Posen, Channel, Jimmy Choo and Dolce & Gabbana, Crystal is now developing a love of being behind, as well as in front, of the camera. ‘A love of images had brought me into modelling, and from there I think it was natural that I picked up a camera.’","Was told age 14 that she could model if she lost weight .

"By . Jill Reilly for MailOnline . China and South Korea reacted strongly to visits by two Japanese Cabinet ministers to a Tokyo shrine that honours the war dead including convicted war criminals. Keiji Furuya, chairman of the National Public Safety Commission, one of the two ministers who visited Yasukuni Shrine, said it was 'only natural as a Japanese' to honor those who had given up their lives for their country. Although Japan's prime minister stayed away, Internal Affairs and Communications Minister Yoshitaka Shindo told reporters his visit was a vow to never wage war again, and shrugged off concerns it may set off a diplomatic row. China and South Korea reacted strongly to visits by two Japanese Cabinet ministers to a Tokyo shrine that honors the war dead including convicted war criminals, although Japan's prime minister stayed away . Internal Affairs and Communications Minister Yoshitaka Shindo told reporters his visit was a vow to never wage war again, and shrugged off concerns it may set off a diplomatic row . 'If it does, the government should give a clear and good explanation,' he told reporters after praying at the shrine. China lambasted the visits as proof of Tokyo's incorrect understanding of history, calling Yasukuni 'a spiritual tool and symbol for the Japanese militarists.' 'Sino-Japanese relations can develop in a healthy and stable way only if Japan can face up to and reflect on the history of invasion and make a clear break with militarism,' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in an online statement. In Seoul, South Korean President Park Geun-hye said some Japanese politicians were acting in a way that hurts both South Koreans and Japanese and further pushes the countries' people apart. In a speech marking South Korea's independence from Japanese colonialism, Park also asked Japanese leaders to act wisely and expressed hopes that next year the countries will move together toward friendlier ties.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe did not go to the shrine, but sent a gift through an envoy. His visit to Yasukuni in December drew widespread criticism, including from the U.S., Japan's most important ally. Abe signed the gift as head of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, and not as prime minister, a party official said. The enshrinement of Class-A war criminals, such as wartime Prime Minister Hideki Tojo, among the 2.5 million dead at Yasukuni Shrine makes the visits a target of condemnation from China and South Korea, which suffered from Japan's aggression and see the shrine as a symbol of brutality. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga defended the visits as religious freedom, noting that praying for the war dead is natural for any country and that the ministers acted in a private capacity. Japanese people wearing imperial army costumes parade as they visit the controversial Yasukuni Shrine to mourn for victims of World War Two . Japan's national flag flutters among visitors at the Yasukuni Shrine . More than 2.5 million Japanese soldiers who died in the service are enshrined at Yasukuni, including convicted war criminals from World War Two . The Yasukuni shrine was built in 1869 under Emperor Meiji in memory of the country’s war dead. The shrine contains the remains of some of those commemorated, but is mostly a symbolic destination for relatives. However the souls of hundreds of convicted war criminals are also enshrined there. They include Second World War leader General Hideki Tojo, who was put to death for war crimes in 1948. China and South Korea see the shrine as a symbol of Tokyo’s aggression during the Second World War, when Japan occupied large areas of China and the Korean peninsula. Japan entered an unwritten agreement with China in the 1970s which suggested that serving leaders would not visit the shrine. Dozens of lawmakers from various parties visited the shrine, wearing dark suits and outfits. At a ceremony commemorating the end of World War II at a Tokyo hall, attended by thousands of people, Abe said later Friday that the sacrifices of the previous generation brought 'peace and prosperity' to Japan. 'We will never forget that,' Abe told the crowd, noting that Japan must 'humbly face up to history.' Emperor Akihito, whose father surrendered at the end of World War II, also offered prayers at the ceremony on a stage covered with chrysanthemums, flanked by his wife Michiko. Although extremist nationalists throng Yasukuni, wearing old uniforms and tooting bugle horns, thousands of regular people also go to the shrine on Aug. 15, the anniversary of the end of the war. Veteran Shirataka Kuribayashi, 88, was among those lining up to bow and pray for no more wars. 'The memory fades away, and people forget about the war. I think we need to stop that,' he said. In December Justin Bieber infuriated Chinese and South Korean fans by posting photos online of his visit the shrine. The Canadian pop star put photos on his Instagram feed - tweeting the link to his 51 million Twitter followers. One photo, of him standing in front of the shrine, was captioned, 'Thank you for your blessings'. After an outcry the photos were removed and Bieber wrote on his Twitter page: 'While in Japan I asked my driver to pull over for which I saw a beautiful shrine. I was mislead to think the Shrines were only a place of prayer. 'To anyone I have offended I am extremely sorry. I love you China and I love you Japan'.

"By . Mark Duell for MailOnline . Bank of England governor: Mark Carney signalled that better-than-expected growth over the successive quarters had built up momentum . Britain is ‘more than halfway towards the finish line’ as the country's economy continues on the road to full recovery from the global financial crisis, the Bank of England governor has said. Mark Carney even signalled that better-than-expected growth over the successive quarters had built up momentum going forward, with the economy predicted to grow by 3.5 per cent this year. He told The Sunday Times: ‘Wherever the finish line was in the depths of the crisis, we are much more than halfway towards that finish line now. ‘The expansion is proceeding, momentum is more assured; the very fact we have had consistent quarters of growth in line with, or slightly better than, our forecasts shows that.’ It comes after the Bank released its inflation report this week, with an upgraded forecast for gross domestic product (GDP) growth for this year from 3.4 per cent to 3.5 per cent. It was also upgraded from 2.9 per cent to 3 per cent for next year. But policy-makers halved the UK's pay growth forecast for 2014 from 2.5 per cent to a below-inflation 1.25 per cent. Official data showed annual pay fell by 0.2 per cent in the three months to June, the first decline recorded since the height of the 2009 financial crisis, and a worse drop than the Bank had forecast.

On the wage drop, 49-year-old Mr Carney, . who took over as governor last July, added he would not wait for pay to . catch up with the cot of living before putting interest rates up. ‘We have to have the confidence that prospective real wages are going to be growing sustainably (before we raise interest rates) - we don't have to wait for the fact of that turn to raise them,’ he told The Sunday Times.

"By . Anna Hodgekiss for MailOnline . A pill to prevent jet lag may be in sight after scientists discovered the gene that causes the condition. The gene, Lhx1, controls waking and sleeping patterns and could also help control dementia, sleep disorders and help shift workers, researchers claim. Every cell in the body has a 'clock' - an abundance of proteins that dip or rise rhythmically over approximately 24 hours. Scientists have discovered the gene that causes the jet lag, paving the way for a pill to treat it . The . master clock responsible for establishing these rhythms and keeping all . the body’s cells in sync is the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). This is a small, . densely packed region of about 20,000 neurons housed in the brain’s . hypothalamus. And these neurons are in close and constant communication with one another, more so than other areas of the brain, say the Californian authors of the new study. The close interaction, combined with exposure to . light and darkness through vision circuits, keeps this master clock in . sync and allows people to stay on essentially the same schedule every . day. However this tight coupling of the cells also helps make them collectively . resistant to change. Exposure to light that resets less than half of the SCN cells, resulting in long periods of jet lag. In the new study, researchers at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies disrupted the light-dark cycles in mice. Using the mouse-version of jet lag - an 8-hour shift in their day-night cycle - . the scientists found that those with little or no Lhx1 readjusted much . faster to the shift in pattern than normal mice. This suggests that because these neurons are less in . sync with one another, they are more easily able to shift to a new . schedule, though it is difficult for them to maintain that schedule. The gene, Lhx1, controls waking and sleeping patterns and could also help control dementia and sleep disorders and . Researchers also found that these mice also exhibited reduced activity of certain genes, including one that creates vasoactive intestinal peptide (Vip) a molecule that has important roles in development and as a hormone in the intestine and blood. In the brain, Vip affects cell communication, but nobody had known that Lhx1 regulated it until now, said study author Professor . Satchidananda Panda . The team also found that adding Vip restored cell synchrony in the master clock responsible for establishing these rhythms and keeping all . the body’s cells in sync. Prof Panda added: 'This approach helped us to close that knowledge gap and show that Vip is a very important protein, at least for the suprachiasmatic nucleus. It can compensate for the loss of Lhx1.' Cutting back on the peptitde could also be another way to treat jet lag. In fact, it could be an even easier drug target compared with Lhx1, because Vip is secreted from cells rather than inside cells, Professor Panda said. He added: 'If we find a drug that will block the Vip receptor or somehow break down Vip, then maybe that will help us reset the clock much faster.' Such treatments could also help people suffering from dementia - thought to be made worse by sleep problems. 'It’s possible that the severity of many dementias . comes from sleep disturbances,' explained Professor Panda. 'If we can restore normal sleep, we can address half of the problem.'","The gene, Lhx1, controls waking and sleeping patterns, say U.S. researchers .

"By . Laura Williamson . Follow @@laura_mail . Louis Smith has a stark message for those who still think he has just ‘waltzed’ back into England’s Commonwealth Games gymnastics team after retiring and then winning the BBC’s Strictly Come Dancing. ‘Louis is back,’ he says, leaning forward, intensity in his eyes. ‘Not the public kind of fame Louis, but the Louis who has trained for 21 years and got three Olympic medals. He’s back to kick some ass.’ In a candid interview, Smith has revealed his battle with depression in trying to cope with the glare of publicity after London 2012 and how hard it has been to regain his gymnastics status after losing sponsorship and Lottery funding. Smith won Great Britain¿s first individual Olympic medal for 100 years in Beijing . The sequins of Saturday night TV have been stripped away and Smith, the gymnast who won Great Britain’s first individual Olympic medal for 100 years in taking bronze at the Beijing Games in 2008, is back on the pommel horse. He retired after winning silver — having earned the same overall score as gold medallist Krisztian Berki of Hungary — and team bronze at London 2012, but started training again last December, shedding a stone in weight in the first three weeks before getting back on his favourite apparatus in mid-January. At 25, however, Smith is no longer a ‘young pup’ in what is a young man’s sport. He insists it ‘was not hard’ to get back into shape after he piled on weight going on lads’ holidays, ‘buying a bottle of champagne in 10 seconds and drinking it and just enjoying life’ after the Olympics. But the rough, calloused surface of Smith’s palms reveal how much effort he has put in over the past seven months: they feel like sandpaper when you shake his hand. Louis Smith won Strictly Coem Dancing with dance partner Flavia Cacace in 2012 . ‘There were loads of articles about “Louis being overweight” and “He’s looking fat” and all the rest of it,’ he says, ‘but it didn’t bother me too much because I knew if I really wanted to I could drop the weight that quick. ‘London definitely sapped me, emotionally and physically, so that’s why I needed the break after 2012 to end up falling back in love with gymnastics and really understand why I enjoy it.’ Smith admits he is ‘exhausted’, but talks about the tough, challenging environment of the gym as if it is a safe haven; a reassuring constant he has known throughout his life. Yet when he first exploded into the public consciousness after the Beijing Olympics, aged only 19, that world suddenly changed, and he struggled to cope. Smith opens up about the ‘dark times’ of depression that afflicted him after winning a medal. He describes his feelings at the time in the manner of someone else looking in, as if he still cannot marry the teenage Louis with the recognised star who had children queuing for autographs outside his mother Elaine’s house in Peterborough. He said: ‘I went from being an 18-year-old kid who could go out, get drunk, eat a kebab with his mates, go to a party and try and snog some girl — just a normal lad — and suddenly I went to the Olympic Games, got a medal, came home and your life has completely changed, exploded. ‘I had responsibilities all of a sudden, I was a role model and I was freaking out. I didn’t know what to do. I got really depressed with it. It got to the point where I was going to the gym, I’d do my work, come back and I wouldn’t talk to anyone. Smith won an individual silver medal and a team bronze at London 2012 . ‘It was a real shock and it was hard — very, very hard and very emotional. You’re used to that old life and you kind of cling on to it. But you can’t have it. ‘That’s the bit that starts breaking you down: trying to hold on to what you had before because this new life is a bit alien and you’re not sure where to step. It was a really dark time.’ Six years on, Smith now speaks with the manner of a man much more comfortable in his own skin, able to joke about being called ‘an Olympic dancer’, yet clear in his own mind about his priorities. Life before London 2012 was a hectic merry-go-round of commercial appearances and training, but now all but one of his sponsors have gone and he no longer receives National Lottery funding. He is doing this himself, and the hard way, having helped to inspire a renaissance in British Gymnastics that has seen more homegrown athletes become genuine contenders on the global stage. Smith was not picked for this year’s European Championships and, although he is targeting next year’s Worlds and the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, he knows selection for England at the Commonwealths is no guarantee of regaining a British vest. Smith is also fiercely conscious there are those, from within the sport and the wider public, who still see his comeback as a publicity stunt. Smith wowed the judges with his performances in Strictly Come Dancing . 'I’m coming back into the sport, kind of alien,’ he says. ‘I haven’t been training from 2012, like the rest of the guys have. I’ve been seen as someone who has taken a break, gone off and done Strictly and shows and enjoyed the limelight. ‘I think some people might have thought me coming back was a publicity stunt and I wasn’t serious about it. I think they felt like I was undermining all the other gymnasts who were training hard. They thought, “How can he waltz in here and expect to take the place of someone who’s been training hard since 2012?” ‘I had to say a few things to raise a few eyebrows and say, “You know, I’m not messing around and you need to take me seriously”. ‘If I did well at the Commonwealth Games it would be bittersweet to certain people who perhaps don’t want to see me in the team, but there would be a lot of satisfaction for me, too.’ He suddenly smiles, unable to resist. ‘And I could do a salsa on the podium.’","Gymnast won individual silver at the London Olympics in 2012 .

The action star and musician was pictured holding sniper rifles, pistols and heavy arms at the Oboronexpo-2014 in Moscow, while hobnobbing with senior members of the Russian government. During the event he spoke with Russian deputy prime minister Dmitry Rogozin and top military figures, in between looking down the sights of the lethal arms on display. Scroll down for video .

Inspecting: Seagal - who has come under fire for performing in annexed Crimea - is pictured above at the Oboronexpo-2014 event near Moscow, holding a Serdyukov SPS semi-automatic pistol . In his sights: The movie star has denied his activities in the Crimea were at all political . Friends in high places: Seagal was seen in discussion with Russian deputy prime minister Dmitry Rogozin . As well as the infantry equipment on display inside, outside the exhibition centre Russian tanks fired rounds into the air, gouts of flame pouring from their turrets. According to the Kremlin-backed Russia Today news outlet, Rogozin said: 'I invited my friend here, a lot of people criticise him at home, it is not an easy time for him right now'. Seagal was attacked just days ago for playing a concert for Russian separatists in the Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine just months ago. In the past he has been pictured with Russian president Vladimir Putin watching martial arts displays. During the performance on Sunday he sang and strummed his guitar on a stage set up with the flag of pro-Russian rebels, who are currently fighting the Ukrainian government in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions which border Russia. Some reports said the stage was also bedecked with Nazi symbols - a reference to the common rebel slur that the Kiev government are fascists - though Seagal vigorously denied the claims.

Controversy: Seagal came under fire for playing at a concert, above, in recently-annexed Crimea . He instead claimed the concert had no political motive and was 'just a good old-fashioned blues concert.' The statement said: 'There was no glorification of war or political motives during the concert which had been booked for many months beforehand. 'It was also reported that there were Radical [sic] flags placed on the stage whilst I was performing this is simply not true and we have photos and film proving this is inaccurate. I was handed a T-shirt and I raised it up as a gesture of goodwill. I am an actor and a musician and we were there for the love of Blues music and nothing else. I want to thank the organizers and all those decent kind peaceful people who attended and enjoyed both the music and the event... 'However I feel both my loyal worldwide fans and other free thinking people know this was just a good old fashioned blues concert.' When asked about his attendance at the arms fair, Seagal's agent revealed that the actor works for one of the arms dealing companies - and is also a personal friend of deputy prime minister Rogozin. He told MailOnline: 'Steven was attending the Fair as he is a designer for one of the weapon manufacturing companies.

'Those of us lucky . enough to be in his sphere saw our hero conquer the world. We joined him . on journeys across the globe,' wrote Mr Spencer. 'He killed ‘em! He . slayed ‘em! What great victories! What wondrous experiences! 'We were incredibly fortunate to follow him into the breach.' But . the author, who has 12 novels currently in print, also shed light on . the personal 'war' that drove Williams to apparently commit suicide on . Monday. He wrote on his own Facebook fan page: 'As a . little boy, he was alone in his room with his toy soldiers while his . parents went off on business trips. You can imagine his mother and . father telling him to be a good little soldier while they were away. Then he would be left alone to play with his friends, which were little . Army men. When his parents returned, he received a gift, a token for his . good behavior, maybe more little soldiers to add to his collection. 'Those . toys remained with him throughout his life and were often given . prominent space in his home on specially crafted display cases.' Mr . Spencer described how Williams' childhood love of military themed toys . developed into a love of first-person shooter video games. He and his . wife, he said, referred to Williams' avid gaming as him 'saving the . world'. Dan Spencer's moving tribute to Williams: The novellist husband of the star's assistant spoke of the 'battles' Referring to . Williams' many appearances entertaining U.S. troops on USO tours, Mr . Spencer went on: 'Then he went off to dangerous places like Afghanistan . and Iraq at the height of war to entertain the troops, the soldiers. Maybe it was a way to pay back his boyhood friends.' 'But . his final conflict was heartbreaking to witness,' wrote Mr Spencer. 'Oh, if you could only have seen the war raging inside him. It would . have stopped your heart. We fought the fight with him, but it left him . defeated. 'Now our hero has laid down his arms. He has bid his soldiers farewell. The final fight is over. 'At last, that lonely little boy is at peace.' Williams entertains the troops at a USO Show: The United Service Organization also paid tribute . Patriotic: Williams famously performed for the USO in Afghanistan, Iraq and Kuwait over the years . The United Service Organization, a non-profit works to lift the spirits of US troops stationed around the world, also paid tribute its own tribute to Williams. The star famously performed for them in Afghanistan, Iraq and Kuwait over the years. 'The entire USO family is saddened by the news of Robin Williams' passing,' the USO said in a statement. 'One of the great comedic actors of his generation, Williams traveled around the world to lift the spirits of our troops and their families. He will always be a part of our USO family and will be sorely missed.' USO photographer Dave Gatley, who took these pictures published in MailOnline today, said Williams approached the task of keeping soldiers' spirits up 'tirelessly'. 'He would make sure he reached everyone he could, staying at each site to make sure he shook each hand to the end,' Mr Gatley said.

The tributes to came after theatres on Broadway, New York City, dimmed their lights last night to mark Williams' passing. Theatregoers, staff and actors across Broadway remembered the star in solemn tribute by dimming their marquees for one minute. A photo of the actor was also projected on a large screen above the Imperial and Music Box theatres. The actor was best known for his screen work but had several hit performances on the stage. In Memoriam: The lights of Broadway's marquees were dimmed Wednesday night for one minute in honor of comedy legend Robin Williams . Theatergoers reveled in his performance alongside Steve Martin in Waiting for Godot in 1988 and more recently in Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo in 2011. Williams appeared in a one man show, Robin Williams: Live on Broadway, in 2002. Those in stage and screen were equally shocked by his suicide on Monday. The exact nature of his death has become a controversial point in the tragedy as San Francisco Bay area sheriffs spoke out yesterday to defend of their decision to reveal how the actor killed himself. Marin County Sheriff's Lieutenant Keith Boyd said in an email that the agency would have liked to withhold some of the information, but could not under the California Public Records Act. 'These kinds of cases, whether they garner national attention or not, are very difficult for everyone involved,' Lt. Boyd said. 'Frankly, it would have been our personal preference to withhold a lot of what we disclosed to the press yesterday, but the California Public Records Act does not give us that kind of latitude.' Memorial in Colorado: Tributes have piled up outside the Boulder property made famous in the 'Mork and Mindy' television show that rocketed Robin Williams to stardom . Boyd announced during a live, televised . news conference Tuesday that Williams committed suicide by hanging . himself. He described in detail how Williams carried out the suicide and . the condition of the body. Some people criticised the level of detail, . and experts in suicide prevention said the information could influence . those considering suicide to try the same thing. 'Having that amount of detail is not helpful' said Lyn Morris, vice president of clinical operations at Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services, which runs the main suicide prevention hotline in Southern California. 'The contagion effect is real, and it's worrisome.' Lt. Boyd said the sheriff's office is discussing with the county's attorney possible exemptions to the public record's act that would allow it to withhold the 911 call it received from Williams' home and fire dispatch tapes. But he said the agency would likely have to release them within ten days, as required by law. Free speech groups defended the disclosures as appropriate and said the law enforcement agency was responding to a crush of a requests for information required to be disclosed. 'Coroners are not required to provide details by press conference,' said Terry Francke, head of open government group Californians Aware. But he said the Marin County Sheriff's Department chose to disseminate as much information as quickly possible at one time rather than leak details piecemeal. Some three dozen television cameras and twice as many reporters from around the globe crowded the news conference outside the sheriff's offices on Tuesday morning. 'While the impact of the details on some people's mourning of Mr. Williams' passing may have been jarring, keeping what was known under wraps would have added needless speculation if not suspicion to the general shock,' Mr Francke said.","Dan Spencer, husband of Rebecca Erwin Spencer, wrote movingly of star .

On Saturday, in his mother Adele's home town of Harrogate, the Manx rider will aim to cross the finish line first in a sprint finish and don the leader's yellow jersey for the very first time. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Cavendish discuss the Tour de France Yorkshire Grand Depart . Regain: Manxman Mark Cavendish is hoping to win the yellow jersey for the first time in his career . Goal: Cavendish has never worn the leader's yellow jersey despite winning 25 Tour stages . Rivalry: Cavendish (left) and Marcel Kittel (right) will be competing for sprint stage wins this year . Sprint king? Cavendish is hoping to prove he is still the best in the world at this year's Tour de France . Dream team? Cavendish (right) with the other eight member of his Omega Pharma-Quick Step squad . 34 - Eddy Merckx (Belgium) 28 - Bernard Hinault (France) 25 - Mark Cavendish (Great Britain), Andre Leducq (France) 22 - Andre Darrigade (France) 20 - Nicholas Frantz (Luxembourg) But, . twelve months on from his agonising loss to German Marcel Kittel in the . 2013 Tour's opening stage in Corsica, the 29-year-old must be wary. Kittel has arrived as the new sprint sensation on the block and he does not look like relenting any time soon. If . you factor in Kittel's fellow German sprinter Andre Greipel, . Norwegian paceman Alexander Kristoff and the supremely talented . double-defending green jersey champion Peter Sagan, then you begin to . realise how tough a task Cavendish has in front of him to remain the undisputed 'sprint king'. But . the British rider is thankfully not alone - he has eight team-mates . alongside him who will attempt to deliver him safely from Leeds to a . sprint finish in Harrogate, and then eventually on to the Champs Elysees . in Paris. Mark Cavendish (Great Britain) The Manx Missile will be looking to add to his 25 Tour de France stage victories as he closes in on Eddy Merckx's record of 34. He will hope his team - and most prominently chief lead-out rider Mark Renshaw - can deliver him to safely to the line in Harrogate on Saturday so he can get his 2014 Tour de France underway. The 29-year-old will be looking to gather as many stage wins as possible as he goes in search of a second green points jersey (he previously won it back in 2011) but he will need to wrestle it away from the brilliant Slovakian Peter Sagan. Tony Martin (Germany) Martin is a time-trial specialist and is a three-time world champion in this discipline. The 29-year-old has also won two Tour stages (in 2011 and 2013) and will be looking to add to that during Stage 20's time trial. Martin could control the pace of the peloton with his strong cycling but he will fade in the mountains alongside Cavendish. Specialist: German Tony Martin is a world time-trial champion and a key member of the team . Mark Renshaw (Australia) The Australian is Cavendish right-hand man and has been his main lead-out rider at two different teams. Renshaw first partnered Cavendish at Team Columbia-High Road between 2008 and 2011 before Cavendish joined Omega last year. Cavendish trusts the 31-year-old to deliver him perfectly to contest a final bunch sprint and he will hope that he does so in Harrogate on Saturday. Trusted: Australian Mark Renshaw will be Cavendish's chief lead-out rider for the sprints . Joy: Renshaw (right) celebrates after leading Cavendish (left) to one of his 25 Tour stage victories . Niki Terpstra (Holland) The 30-year-old Dutchman won the Paris-Roubaix classic earlier this year and he is an outside bet to claim a stage victory this year if he can form a breakaway. Michal Kwiatkowski (Poland) Kwiatkowski is a bit of an all-rounder - he is strong at climbing, is a competent sprinter and an ex-junior world champion time-trialist. The 29-year-old will help Cavendish out by attempting to control the pace on sprint stages but he could be let loose in the mountains to chase personal glory. Matteo Trentin (Italy) Omega are littered with potential stage winners and 24-year-old Trentin will hope to add to his solitary Tour victory last season. Trentin rushed away from the peloton to win in a sprint finish on Stage 14 in 2013 and he could repeat that feat in a long, drawn-out stage this year. Talented: Belgian Jan Bakelants is the only member of the team to have worn the yellow jersey . Jan Bakelants (Belgium) The only member of the team to have worn the yellow jersey, Bakelants claimed the maillot jaune when he won stage two in 2013. Bakelants, 28, has just joined the team this season from RadioShack-Leopard and he will be expected to do some of Cavendish's grunt work to help him don the famous jersey this time around. Michal Golas (Poland) Golas is a domestique everyone would love to have in their team and the 30-year-old will cycle himself into the ground to deliver Cavendish, Kwiatkowski or Trentin to stage victories. Experienced: Italian Alessandro Petacchi has won the points jerseys at all three Grand Tours . Alessandro Petacchi (Italy) Petacchi is the veteran of the team at 40 years of age but he is a specialist sprinter like Cavendish who has an impressive six individual stage victories to his name - as well as being the 2010 green jersey winner. He has a chequered past having been banned for doping in 2007, but he has won 48 Grand Tour stages and the points jersey in the Giro d'Italia, Vuelta a Espana and the Tour. Petacchi gave up his role as lead sprinter last year and left Lampre-Merida for Omega, where he now performs a role as part of the lead-out team for Cavendish. He will be key alongside Renshaw if Cavendish is to claim stage wins. The Manx Missile rides for the Belgian . Omega Pharma-Quick Step team, whose title sponsors are both a . pharmaceutical company and manufacturers of laminate flooring. His . team contains four other riders with Tour stage victories under their . belt - including world time-trial champion Tony Martin - as well as his . most trusted lieutenant. Australian Mark Renshaw is Cavendish's right-hand man and he has been the Manx cyclist's main lead-out rider at two different teams. Renshaw first partnered Cavendish at Team Columbia-High Road between 2008 and 2011 before the Manxman joined Omega last year. Cavendish . trusts the 31-year-old to deliver him perfectly to contest a final . bunch sprint and he will hope that he does so in Harrogate on Saturday. Teamwork: Cavendish (left) will be led out for sprints by team-mates, most notably Renshaw (centre) Group: Cavendish (with microphone) sits alongside his Omega team-mates in a pre-tour press conference . When asked about competing in Harrogate, Cavendish said: 'To think the first stage is in Yorkshire and finishes in my mother's home town - it's really exciting. 'But there are 200 bike riders on the start line almost and every one of those would like to win the yellow jersey. 'It just so happens the media attention is around me because my mum is from Harrogate. 'I remember being here in Harrogate many summers. My grandparents, my uncle still lives here. 'It's nice to look around the places I knew when I was young.' One . thing is for certain, it is not just Cavendish from Omega Pharma-Quick . Step who wants him to cross that finish line first - there are eight other . men who will give everything for the Brit's cause. And, . if they can deliver once more, then Cavendish will finally get his . dream of wearing that famous yellow jersey in his mother's home town.

"By . Chris Waugh . Follow @@ChrisDHWaugh . The Tour de France begins in Yorkshire on Saturday with British hopes firmly resting on the shoulders of Chris Froome and Mark Cavendish. Froome is aiming to defend the overall winner's yellow jersey - or maillot jaune - having triumphed in the 100th edition of the race last year, while Cavendish is targeting regaining the green points jersey, awarded to the best sprinter, which he won in 2011. Here Sportsmail takes a look at the main competitors for the yellow, green, polka dot (King of the Mountains) and white (best young rider) jerseys. Ready: Sky employees from Leeds unveil the world's biggest jersey ahead of the 2014 Tour de France . Geared up: Yorkshire will host the Grand Depart, with Froome looking to retain his yellow jersey . Yellow jersey (general classification winner) contenders . Chris Froome (Team Sky, 10-11 favourite) Speculation surrounded whether or not 2012 winner Bradley Wiggins would feature in Team Sky's squad for the Tour in the build-up to the race but he has been left out and 'Froome-dog' has the nine men he wants to mount his bid for glory. Froome is odds-on to deliver his second - and Team Sky's third - yellow jersey on the spin, with his all-round ability placing him ahead of the pack. The 29-year-old's versatility on the climbs and in the time-trial stages should give him the edge but, although he won the Tour de Romandie for the second consecutive year, he has suffered from injuries and illness recently that could wreck his chances. Favourite: Team Sky's British rider Froome has a great chance of retaining his yellow jersey . Versatile: Froome (in yellow) is strong at climbing as well as time trials, which should give him the edge . Mentor: Froome (right) with Team Sky team principal Dave Brailsford during the 2013 Tour . Absent: 2012 Tour winner Bradley Wiggins (centre) was not selected by Team Sky . Alberto Contador (Team Tinkoff-Saxo, 6-4) Two-time Tour winner Contador finished fourth in last year's edition following a return from a two-year drugs ban but he has won both the Tour of the Basque Country and the Tierro-Adriatico already this season. The Spaniard will surely be Froome's main challenger and will push him hard in the mountains. Threat: Spain's Alberto Contador is Froome's most likely challenger in this year's Tour de France . Vincenzo Nibali (Astana, 10-1) The 29-year-old Italian is an accomplished climber and, with Grand Tour victories in the Giro d'Italia (2013) and Vuelta a Espana (2010) already under his belt, Nibali is experienced. A win here would give Nibali a full set of Grand Tour wins and he will have to perform exceptionally well in the mountains to deliver that. Experienced: Italian Vincenzo Nibali is looking to complete his set of Grand Tour wins . Alejandro Valverde (Movistar, 14-1) The 2009 Vuelta a Espana champion has returned to form in recent months and the unusually versatile Spaniard - he is a strong sprinter as well as a strong climber - could spring a surprise. Form: Movistar's Spanish rider Alejandro Valverde has been getting back to his best recently . Andrew Talansky (Garmin-Sharp, 33-1) American Talansky won the young rider classification white jersey in 2013 and has followed that up with a Criterium du Dauphine victory this year. It is probably too soon for the 25-year-old but he is a dark horse for this year's race. Outsider: US rider Andrew Talansky of Team Garmin-Sharp is a dark horse for the general classification . Green jersey (points classification winner) contenders . Peter Sagan (Cannondale, 8-15 favourite) The Slovakian has competed in two Tours and won the green jersey on each occasion so it is hard to look past the 24-year-old. He is not just a pure sprinter but is very strong on long stages and can climb a bit too, meaning he is always there or thereabouts when it comes to collecting points on a stage. Always in green: Slovakian Peter Sagan is looking to win his third straight points classification . Marcel Kittel (Giant-Shimano, 9-2) Kittel won the most stages last season and the German looks to be the new sprint sensation. He is an out-and-out sprinter though so will have to rely on stage wins if he is to take home green. Raw pace: German sprint sensation Marcel Kittel won the most stages during last year's Tour . Mark Cavendish (Omega Pharma-Quick Step, 5-1) The same applies for Cavendish who will need to gather as many stages as possible - starting with the Grand Depart on Saturday in Yorkshire which could see him wear yellow for the first time ever too - if he is to regain the jersey he won in 2011. Cavendish out-sprinted Kittel in the Tirreno-Adriatico earlier this year but they have barely competed aside from that so it will be interesting to see if there are any psychological scars left over from last year. The 29-year-old Manx rider has a team built to deliver him stage wins so Cavendish could upset the odds and walk away with green. Regain: Manxman Mark Cavendish is hoping to win the green jersey he first claimed in 2011 . Rivalry: Cavendish (left) and Kittel (right) will be competing for sprint stage wins this year . Sprint king: After struggling a little last year, Cavendish is hoping to return to the top of the charts . Andre Greipel (Lotto-Belisol, 14-1) The German leads the stage victory rankings for 2014 with 11 already this year but is often overshadowed by Cavendish and Kittel. He will struggle to hold off his most consistent competitors. Quick: German Andre Greipel has already won 11 stages so far this year and could claim the sprinter's jersey . Alexander Kristoff (Katusha, 16-1) Not a sprinter but more a stage rider. He had a brilliant spring, dominating the classics, but tends to come into his own after long, arduous stages with sprints at the end. Difficult to see the Norwegian gaining enough points. Unusual: Norwegian Alexander Kristoff is more of a stage rider than a sprinter in reality . Polka dot jersey (King of the Mountains) contenders . Alberto Contador (Team Tinkoff-Saxo, 7-2 favourite) Chris Froome (Team Sky, 4-1) Rivalry: Froome (right) or Contador (left) will likely claim the Kings of the Mountains jersey as well . Pierre Rolland (Team Europcar, 9-2) Rolland seems the most likely to claim the polka dot jersey outside of the big two. The Frenchman won the white jersey in 2011 and he claimed the 19th stage of that race at the summit of Alpe D'Huez, highlighting his climbing credentials. Joaquim Rodriguez (Katusha, 6-1) His climbing prowess has brought him ten Grand Tour stage victories, as well as the mountains classification in the 2005 Vuelta a Espana. At 35 he may be starting to show signs of aging but he is still capable of claiming the stage wins necessary to bolster his chances. Thomas Voeckler (Team Europcar, 12-1) Unusually Team Europcar have two riders more than capable of claiming the King of the Mountains jersey. Frenchman Voeckler won this jersey in 2012 and always performs well at his home race so he could deliver once more. Pride: Frenchman Thomas Voeckler is hoping to claim polka dot jersey glory for his home nation . White jersey (best young rider winner) contenders . Thibaut Pinot (FDJ.fr) A disastrous end to last year's Tour seems to have fuelled the Frenchman and if he shows his true form he should claim the white jersey. Prone to an implosion though, so by no means guaranteed. Romain Bardet (Ag2r-La Mondiale) Stage wins may be more likely for this strong climber but, as another French hope, the home crowd will be cheering him towards a high general classification finish. Second fiddle: Pole Rafal Majka will ride for Team Tinkoff-Saxo's leader Contador at the Tour . Rafal Majka (Team Tinkoff-Saxo) The Pole led his team at the Giro this year and finished in white there and could do so again. However, he may have to sacrifice his own position for team leader Contador and that may cost him. Michal Kwiatkowski (Omega Pharma-Quick Step) Another Pole with big ambitions but his form has let him down. Kwiatkowski seriously struggled in the Dauphine and will need to find some extra pace from somewhere if he is to challenge. Jon Izaguirre (Movistar) An extreme outside shot to win, but Izaguirre will hope to follow Valverde and possibly shoot up the rankings alongside his fellow Spaniard by doing his donkey work in the mountains. Unlikely: Spaniard Jon Izaguirre is an extreme outside shot to win but could claim the white jersey .","Tour de France Grand Depart takes place in Yorkshire on Saturday .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . The bizarre way a lizard breathes could make it more likely to survive natural disasters capable of wiping out other species. This is according to a U.S. study that revealed the savannah monitor lizard breathes like a bird through a one-way loop. The finding is surprising because the unidirectional airflow of birds was thought to have evolved due to the high-oxygen demands of flight. The bizarre way a lizard breathes could make it more likely to survive natural disasters capable of wiping out other species. This is according to a recent U.S. study that revealed the savannah monitor lizard breathes like a bird through a one-way loop . Researchers at the University of Utah suggest the trait in lizards may have been an adaptation to lower oxygen levels on ancient Earth. For instance, during the early Triassic era 250 million years ago, oxygen made up 12 per cent of air compared with 21 per cent today. ‘It might explain something about why monitor lizards are so successful,’ Mathew Wedel, a biologist at Western University of Health Sciences told Ewen Callaway at Nature. ‘Who knows when the next asteroid hits, maybe monitor lizards will inherit the Earth.’ The upper image is a colourised CT scan showing different airways in the lung of a monitor lizard. The bottom image shows how air flows in a mostly one-way loop through the lizard's lung, as measured by sensors implanted as part of a University of Utah study . The find suggests one-way breathing may have originated 270 million years ago - 20 million years earlier than first thought. Other than the American alligator, the savannah monitor lizard is the only other known reptile found with the ability to breathe in this way. This is in contrast to humans and other mammals who have a two-way, or ‘tidal’, breathing pattern. Tidal breathing means air enters the lungs through airways and then flows back out again the same way. Rather than being partially filled with stale air, like human lungs, a bird’s lungs contain air with much higher oxygen content to help them fly. 'Who knows when the next asteroid hits, maybe monitor lizards will inherit the Earth,' said Mathew Wedel, a biologist at Western University of Health Sciences . The . study showed that air enters the lizard's trachea or windpipe, and then . flows into the two primary airways, which enter the lung. But . then, instead of flowing tidally back out the same way, the air loops back in a tail-to-head direction moving from one lateral airway . to the next through small perforations between them.

We now know it's not unique to birds,’ said Colleen Farmer, the study's senior author and an associate professor of biology at the University of Utah. But Professor Farmer cautioned that, because lizard lungs have a different structure than bird and alligator lungs, it is also possible that one-way airflow evolved independently. The evolution would have occurred about 250 million years ago in the archosaurs, the group that gave rise to alligators, dinosaurs and birds. The researchers performed CT scans and made 3D images of lizard lungs to visualise the anatomy of the lungs. They surgically implanted flow meters in the bronchi of five monitor lizards to measure airflow direction. Using lungs removed from 10 dead lizards, the researchers measured air flow as they pumped air into and out of the lungs. They also pumped water filled with sunflower pollen or plastic microspheres through lizard lungs, and the movement of the pollen and spheres also showed the unidirectional airflow. The study showed that air enters the lizard's trachea or windpipe, and then flows into the two primary airways, which enter the lung. But then, instead of flowing tidally back out the same way, the air loops back in a tail-to-head direction moving from one lateral airway to the next through small perforations between them. ‘It shows our previous notions about the function of these one-way patterns of airflow are inadequate. They are found in animals besides those with fast metabolisms,’ said Professor Farmer.","The savannah monitor lizard breathes like a bird through a one-way loop .

Froome became only the second Brit - after Sir Bradley Wiggins in 2012 - to win the Tour, and he did so in it's 100th edition. Here, Sportsmail takes a look at this year's Tour de France and tells you everything you need to know about the biggest cycling race in the world. Geared up: Yorkshire will host the Grand Depart of the Tour de France on Saturday . Ready: Sky employees from Leeds unveil the world's biggest jersey ahead of the 2014 Tour de France . Brits on show . There are some notable British riders who will not be riding the Tour de France this year due to injury, illness or non-selection: . Four Brits will line-up in Leeds on Saturday as the 101st edition of the Tour begins. Chris Froome (Team Sky) 'Froome-dog' is the pre-race favourite to defend the leader's yellow jersey he won last year. The 29-year-old's versatility on the climbs and in time-trial stages should give him a great chance of winning but, although he won the Tour de Romandie for the second consecutive year, he has suffered from injuries and illness recently that could harm his chances. Mark Cavendish (Omega Pharma-Quick Step) The Manx Missile will be looking to gather as many stage wins as possible as he goes in search of a second green points jersey (he previously won it back in 2011). Cavendish, 29, has already claimed 25 individual stage wins on the Tour and he will hope to add to that on Saturday. Geraint Thomas (Team Sky) The 28-year-old Welshman has raced on both the track and the road but he will be expected to work hard to try and deliver Froome to a second successive Tour win. Simon Yates (Orica-GreenEdge) A surprise selection ahead of his twin brother Adam, 21-year-old Yates will make his Tour debut hoping to push Orica-GreenEdge towards stage victories. Favourite: Team Sky's British rider Chris Froome has a great chance of retaining his yellow jersey . Ready: Mark Cavendish has been cycling the route of Saturday's Grand Depart of the Tour de France . Brit: Geraint Thomas will ride the Tour for Team Sky, hoping to lead Chris Froome to overall victory . Debut: Simon Yates was a surprise inclusion for this year's Tour de France so will hope to impress . Route . 3,664km - Distance covered by riders . 21 - Number of stages on the 2014 Tour (six mountain stages and one time trial) 3 - Stages to be held in England . 4 - Number of countries that the Tour will visit (England, France, Belgium and Spain) 3.5billion - Worldwide TV viewers (in 190 different countries) 22 - Different teams (18 of which are UCI World Tour teams, four are wild-cards) 198 - Riders taking part in the Tour . The Tour starts on Saturday and lasts until July 27. It comprises 21 stages and covers 3,664km in total. Stages one to three will take place in England. The Tour begins with a 190km stage between Leeds and Harrogate, then on day two it travels 201km between York and Sheffield, and on its third day in England the riders will cycle 155km from Cambridge to London. Such is the wide scope of the Tour, this year's route will see the riders visit four countries in all: England, France, Belgium and Spain. There are six mountain stages this year (of which five are summit finishes) and just one time trial (54km race during stage 20). Why does the Tour de France start in England? Areas have to bid for the right to host stages of the Tour and, essentially, whichever proposals are the best financially and practically will be awarded with stages. The majority of the Tour still takes place in France but stages are hosted elsewhere due to the prestige of the event itself and the tourism it can attract to areas such as Yorkshire. This is the fourth Tour de France to contain stages in England after the 1974, 1994 and 2007 editions. Bid: Areas have to put forward proposals to host stages and Britain have three in 2014 . Streets: Team Sky practise on the cobbled roads of Yorkshire ahead of the Tour . Jerseys . Why are riders competing for different jerseys? Each colour jersey rewards different types of cyclists. The best rider in each of those categories is given the right to wear that jersey while riding the Tour and the jerseys are awarded individually at the end of each stage. What are the different jerseys? Leader: The yellow jersey is awarded to the rider who has the lowest time in the general classification . Yellow - The maillot jaune is awarded to the rider who is leading the general classification - has the quickest overall time so far in the race - and is the most prestigious of all the jerseys. Green - This is awarded to the rider who is the most consistent finisher, which tends to mean it favours the sprinters due to it being more heavily weighted towards flat stages. The winner on a sprint stage collects 45 points, a medium mountain stage 30 points, and on high mountains or individual time trial stages just 20 points. Points are also awarded at intermediate sprints during stages (20 points for first place down to one point for the 15th rider). Polka dot - This is awarded to the best climber. Points are gained by reaching the tops of hills or mountains first, with steeper hills rewarded with a greater number of points. Points are awarded on a sliding scale like with the green jersey. White - This is awarded to the best placed rider aged 25 or under in the general classification. Click here to read more about the favourites for each jersey. Always in green: Slovakian Peter Sagan is looking to win his third straight points classification . Teams . Ag2r-La Mondiale . Astana . Belkin Pro Cycling . BMC Racing Team . Bretagne-Seche .

Orica-GreenEDGE . Movistar Team . Team Katusha . Team NetApp-Endura (wild-card team) Team Europcar . Team Tinkoff-Saxo . Trek Factory Racing . Team Sky . Cycling can appear to be a very individual sport what with one person seemingly claiming over-all victory, but nothing could be further from the case. The plaudits go to the winner but it takes a real team effort for Froome or Bradley Wiggins to get to a position where they can win a Grand Tour. There are 22 teams in the Tour de France, 18 of which are UCI WorldTour teams (they compete in a race circuit all around the world) and there are also four wild-cards (who are allowed entry to the Tour without competing on the rest of the circuit). Each team comprises nine riders, meaning 198 cyclists will line-up in Leeds on Saturday . What are team leaders? A team leader is the person most likely to win the Tour, or to claim stage victories. Each team has a designated team leader who, in the case of Team Sky, is defending champion Chris Froome. He will wear the number one on his jersey as the defending champion. What are domestiques? Froome's team-mates will wear numbers two through nine and they will be his 'domestiques'. A domestique is a support rider who cycles for his team leader. They effectively do the donkey work to deliver stage victories or to protect their lead riders. In Team Sky, Britain's Geraint Thomas will act as one of Froome's domestiques and will be expected to protect and shield his leader. Alongside Thomas, Bernhard Eisel, Vasil Kiryienka, David Lopez, Mikel Nieve, Danny Pate, Xabier Zandio and Richie Porte will also look to help Froome to glory. If Froome was to succumb to injury or misfortune then Porte would likely move up to team leader. Cavendish also has domestiques, but they will look to deliver him to the final sprint of the stages he is targeting winning before letting the Manxman do the rest. Together as one: Teams play a vital role in the Tour and it is not at all an individual event . Prize money . If the overall race leader needs to take a toilet break then the peleton will slow to allow him to catch-up. The yellow jersey holder entering into the final stage will be allowed by other riders to win the race as long as he can complete the last stage unscathed. The peloton will often slow to allow riders involved in a crash, or who have been the subject of sabotage, to catch up. Overall winner of the Tour . £357,000 (usually split between the nine riders in a team - it is a Tour tradition that the overall winner will share the pot with his team-mates). Individual stage winners . £20,000. Green jersey winner . £20,000. Polka dot jersey winner . £20,000. Best young rider winner . £20,000. What role do sponsors play? Most team names - for example Team Sky - are based around a sponsor's branding due to the huge investment. Often riders who win stages will point to their sponsors in order to give them prominence on TV or in photographs. On show: The brands of the chief sponsors are emblazoned on the jerseys of the riders . Terminology . Peloton . The peloton is the main bunch of riders on a given stage. Riders tend to conserve energy by bundling close together and taking it in turns to lead the pack. Drafting . Drafting or slipstreaming is where riders will try and form a line directly behind one another in order to benefit from the slipstream in front and to conserve energy. Team-mates may take turns in leading a group because of this, or a rider may attempt to follow a rival closely to also benefit from this. Breaks . A 'break' is when one or more riders have split from the main peloton and opened out a lead on the main pack. Grand Depart . The 'Grand Depart' is the first stage of the Tour. Time Trials . An individual time trial is where a cyclist will race against clock by themselves around a stage. There is only one time trial on this year's Tour - a 54km road time trial during Stage 20.

"By . Matt Mcgeehan, Press Association . Johan Bruyneel, Lance Armstrong’s long-time team director, has been banned for 10 years by the American Arbitration Association. Armstrong was given a life ban by the United States Anti-Doping Agency and stripped of all results dating from August 1998 - including seven Tour de France wins from 1999 to 2005 - after USADA’s investigation into the United States Postal Service team uncovered widespread doping and he opted not to challenge the ruling. Bruyneel, who worked with Armstrong at the US Postal and Discovery Channel teams, was widely implicated in USADA’s report, but took his case to an three-person arbitration panel in London last December and was banned until June 11, 2022. Banned: Johan Bruyneel, left, the former team manager of Lance Armstrong, right, has been banned from any participation in cycling for 10 years . Team doctor Pedro Celaya and trainer . Jose ‘Pepe’ Marti were given eight-year bans for their roles in what . USADA described in August 2012 as 'the most sophisticated, . professionalised and successful doping programme sport has ever seen'. A USADA statement read: 'All three committed multiple anti-doping rule violations over many years.'The . panel found that ‘the evidence establishes conclusively that Mr . Bruyneel was at the apex of a conspiracy to commit widespread doping on . the USPS and Discovery Channel teams spanning many years and many . riders.

Bruyneel responded in his personal blog, while questioning USADA’s . jurisdiction over him and raising the prospect of challenging his ban in . the Court of Arbitration for Sport. 'I . do not dispute that there are certain elements of my career that I wish . had been different,' Bruyneel, who refused to testify at the . arbitration hearing, wrote on johanbruyneel.com.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . A health monitoring smart collar for dogs could help owners and vets spot potential pet health problems . Not content with logging every detail about their own exercise regimes, diets and sleep patterns, humans have now created a FitBit-esque gadget for their canine companions. A smart collar for dogs that measures heart and respiratory rates as well as counting calories could help owners and vets spot potential health problems. Voyce claims it will let owners know what their dog is trying to tell them when it comes to health, including if they are getting enough exercise. The device, which is like a FitBit for dogs, uses special algorithms and will provide owners with trends about their dog’s health and fitness, which they can view using an app. ‘Voyce monitors key vital signs including heart rate and respiratory rate, along with other wellness indicators such as activity, rest, calories burned, and more,’ I4C Innovations, the company behind the innovation said. ‘All of these data points come together to paint a more complete picture of your dog’s well being.’ The collar and app was developed in collaboration with biomedical engineers, dog experts, and Cornell University,Ithaca, New York and it could help vets gain an insight to a dog’s health between check-ups. The smart collar, which went on show at the Consumer Electronics SHow (CES in las Vegas, measures a dog’s activity continually so that an owner will be able to track their pet’s behaviour and weight. Changes in activity level could indicate early signs of common conditions including arthritis, hip dysplasia, heart and lung problems and anxiety, which could lead to early diagnosis and treatment. Scroll down for video . The Voyce collar (pictured) claims to let owners know what their dog is trying to tell them when it comes to health, including if their pet is getting enough exercise . With a heartrate monitor built in, the collar will provide a daily average of beats per minute and can provide clues about conditions such as heart disease or chronic pain. The system will detect abnormalities by monitoring recent trends and changes in breathing can also indicate health conditions, which is why the collar monitors an animal’s respiratory rate. The idea is that if medical conditions are caught early, it could improve a dog’s quality of life and reduce treatment costs for owners. Counting the number of calories the . canine burns, the device can compare data to previous trends, which . could help an owner make sure their dog does not become fat. The smart collar can also monitors a . dog’s rest patterns, checking for decreasing periods of rest or . interrupted sleep, which are often indications of discomfort or bad . health, the experts said.

"By . Sam Webb . Incredible footage has emerged of a fish leaping out of the water and plucking a fast-flying swallow out of the air - an event believed to have never before been captured on film. While many fish are known to occasionally eat birds, such as sharks, piranhas, eels and pikes, they usually prey on swimming, floating or stationary birds near the waterline. There have been reports of the African tigerfish, a fierce predator with large teeth found in many rivers and lakes on the continent, leaping out of the water to eat low-flying birds, but the phenomenon has never been captured on film. Scroll down for video . Flying fish: This is the moment an African tigerfish launches itself out of the water and grabs a swallow . This footage is the first time a a freshwater fish has been seen catching a flying bird . The footage is all the more breathtaking because the unlucky bird is a swallow, an incredibly agile species that can hit speeds of 40mph. It was taken at Schroda Dam, a lake on the Limpopo River catchment in the Mapungubwe National Park in South Africa using a motion capture camera as part of a study by the Unit of Environmental Sciences and Management at the North-West University in Potchefstroom, South Africa. The predatory behaviour has been reported by numerous biologists, but definitive proof has eluded them until now. The Journal of Fish Biology reports: 'As far as is known, this is the first confirmed record of a freshwater fish preying on birds in flight.' Bird food: The footage was taken by researchers from a South African university . The predatory behaviour has been reported by numerous biologists, but definitive proof has eluded them until now . Scientists believe the behaviour may have been adopted out of necessity because of limited food supplies in the tigerfish's habitat. Ironically, the tigerfish's pursuit of its avian prey also makes it more vulnerable to the African fish eagle, a common predator in the region. The report added: 'During the 15 day survey as many as 20 successful attempts by H. vittatus (African Tigerfish) individuals were observed on a daily basis. 'Two predation strategies were displayed by H.vittatus. These included surface or sub-surface pursuits of H. rustica (swallows), followed by aerial strikes, and direct aerial strikes initiated from deeper water.'

"By . Lucy Crossley . Theory: More than 150 years after Charles Darwin noted that animals were tamer on his beloved Galapagos Islands, his theory has been proved right by scientists . More than 150 years after Charles Darwin noted that animals were tamer on his beloved Galapagos Islands, his theory has been proved right by scientists. The celebrated naturalist and geologist had casually observed that island animals often appeared tame, and questioned if they had evolved in that way after inhabiting areas without many predators. The idea was an off-shoot of Darwin's evolutionary theories regarding natural selection, in which animals would change, and eventually become better suited to their environment over subsequent generations. Now, 183 years after Darwin embarked on his voyage on HMS Beagle, which took him to the Galapagos, off the coast of Ecuador, a team of scientists have proven that island lizards are in fact 'tame', compared with their mainland cousins. The researchers from the University of California, Riverside, Indiana University Purdue University Fort Wayne and George Washington University found that they were able to approach island lizards and get far closer to them then they could mainland lizards. 'Our study confirms Darwin's . observations and numerous anecdotal reports of island tameness,' Theodore Garland, from University of California Riverside told Phys.org. 'His insights have once again proven to be correct, and remain an important source of inspiration for present-day biologists.' As part of the research, which will appear in the Proceedings . of the Royal Society B next month, the experts analysed the correlation . between flight initiation distance - the moment in which a predator's . prey starts to flee, distance from the mainland, island area and . activities of 66 different species of lizards. Can't be tamed: Scientists have found that mainland lizards, such as this desert iguana in Mexico, appear less 'tame' than their island cousins . Studies focussed on lizards from five continents and islands in the Atlantic . and Pacific Oceans, and the Caribbean and Mediterranean Seas, with the . results revealing that the flight initiation distance decreased as the . distance from the mainland increased. Professor . Garland said that the escape responses are lessened on remote islands . because there are fewer predators, so natural selection favours animals . that do not need to flee. The . team also discovered that the size of the prey can affect its escape . behaviour, as when animals are very small compared to their predators . they are not attacked individually. 'This results in the absence of fleeing or very short flight initiation distance,' said Professor Garland. Research: Studies focussed on lizards from five continents and islands in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and the Caribbean and Mediterranean Seas, such as the Long-nosed Leopard Lizard from Arizona .","Charles Darwin asked if island animals were affected by a lack of predators .

"By . Sarah Dean For Daily Mail Australia . Singer Sir Cliff Richard and Rolling Stones rocker Keith Richards are both British music legends but there's no mistaking their differences. However, that didn't stop one Sky News Australia journalist muddling the pair up.

She then replied to one person who pointed out her error, saying: 'I think I am done tweeting while at the news desk during breaking news. Brain explosion and sleep deprivation. Sorry all.'

The case against Tostee - who has boasted about his conquests online - was brought about after police seized footage allegedly showing the meeting between him and Ms Wright when they connected via mobile dating app Tinder. according to The Daily Telegraph. Tostee has also previously revealed he was 'obsessed' with recording videos on an online bodybuilding forum. Ms Wright was on a two-week holiday for a friend's wedding but the trip took a tragic turn when her body was found in the early morning hours of Friday, August 8, at the bottom of the Wahroonga Place building. Within minutes, police arrived at the scene after a male witness raised the alarm and searched the apartment from which she fell, but it was empty. Hours later, Tostee presented himself to police at the Surfers Paradise station where he was questioned for more than two hours with his lawyer before being released without charge. At the time, police said Tostee had 'exercised his right to silence'. The 28-year-old also took to social media to deny his involvement in Ms Wright's death. 'I absolutely did not cause this girl to fall and I am devastated about what happened to her,' he posted.

In her sister's honour, Reza lit a candlelight and had a beer at the site where Ms Wright's body was found, according to The Daily Telegraph. Leading up to Tostee's arrest, it was revealed he was a regular on the Gold Coast's party strip and often visited nightclubs such as Crazy Horse, Cocktails, Club Liv, Bourbon Bar, Players, Alive, Vanity and Sin City. But he was banned from two of them after staff deemed his behaviour as 'creepy'. A bouncer at one of the clubs along the strip told Daily Mail Australia Mr Tostee would obsessively film events with his phone and in one case a violent incident outside a club until he was told to leave. Tostee hit back at reports police took footage away from his Gold Coast unit of his conquests. Footage aired on Nine News earlier this week reportedly shows Mr Tostee hosting a girl in an apartment. It shows a woman apparently stealing his wallet before leaving in the middle of the night. 'This footage was from a security camera in the living room of my previous apartment at Circle on Cavill in 2012.

During investigations, Detective Superintendent Dave Hutchinson said police had obtained statements from 'a number of women'. Detectives also interviewed his parents Gray and Helene Tostee at their home in a gated community in Carrara, where their son had been hiding out since the incident happened. 'He has exercised his right to silence,' Det Supt Hutchinson told Daily Mail Australia earlier this week. Supt Hutchinson said a 'forensic procedure order' had been carried out against Tostee, which is believed to have included blood samples and a DNA swab. Despite his refusal to talk to police, Tostee took to a body building forum three times on Monday to talk about the investigation. At 10.21am, he wrote on the forum: 'I've been advised not to go into details but all I will say is that I absolutely did NOT cause this girl to fall and that I am devastated about what happened to her.' About an hour later, he posted again: 'Fact is I’ve taken home probably about 150 girls from clubs over the last few years. When you go out often to the same places and get drunk and talk to girls you’re bound to get noticed and hated on, and people gossip. 'Eventually it turns into Chinese whispers where people have a completely false impression of you. 'Most people who know me have been completely supportive, it's those who don't know me at all who assume the worst.' Thirteen minutes later, at 11.31am, he added: 'My reputation has already been destroyed without me saying anything at all. It’s nothing I haven’t already posted in this thread, but that’s all I have to say for now.' Video footage that appeared on Nine News reportedly shows Gable Tostee hosting a woman in his apartment .

The 26-year-old Kiwi tourist's final words were allegedly: 'No, no, no … I just want to go home.' Audio recordings from mobile phones found in a car in the building's basement are believed to be the lead detectives were looking for to arrest Tostee on Friday.

"By . Annette Witheridge for MailOnline . Robin Williams and his second wife Marsha were living apart in 2008 when the comedic genius fell head over heels for a stunning blonde artist named Charlotte Filbert. She was 27, he was 56. Now Charlotte is among the millions mourning his death. Choked up and close to tears, she told MailOnline: 'It’s very, very sad. My thoughts and prayers are with his family.' 'I have my own family now, I just had a baby, and I am thinking about his family.' Scroll down for video . Heartbroken: Robin Williams' ex-girlfriend, artist Charlotte Filbert, began seeing the revered actor after he and his wife Marsha stopped living together. She was close to tears when she spoke to MailOnline . Separation: : Williams and Marsha had been struggling to save their marriage for two years and had quietly decided to separate on New Year's Eve 2007. He met Charlotte the following year . Asked when she had last spoken to Williams, she would only repeat: 'All I really want to say is that my thoughts and prayers are with his family.' Robin Williams was introduced to Charlotte through designer Tommy Hilfiger’s socialite daughter Ally. In November 2007, rumors swirled that Williams was seeing Ally, then 23, when he was spotted leaving her home. But it later transpired he was actually seeing her pal Charlotte. Robin and Charlotte became close through their shared love of art. The actor bought several of her paintings. He wooed her with romantic dinners and walks along the beach with her dog. According to The National Enquirer, that broke the story of their affair at the time, Robin gave Charlotte a $10,000-a-month allowance to rent a swanky apartment in Manhattan. A year . later, Ally spent the evening with Robin and Charlotte when they rocked up at . a Manhattan comedy club after attending a nearby art gallery opening. The . New York Post’s Page Six gossip column reported that Williams did an . impromptu stand-up session at The Upright Citizens Brigade Theater on . West 26th Street. 'He showed up with no prior notice. This is the second time in as many months he’s just popped in,' a source at the club said. The art of love: Robin and Charlotte shared a passion for art . Love lost: Robin wooed Charlotte with walks on the beach with her dog . A few monthes after Charlotte and Robin connected, photographers in Paris spotted him with his wife Marsha and their two children Zelda, then teenaged Zelda and Cody on vacation in March 2008. 'He seemed distracted. He wasn’t his usual self,' one told People magazine. 'Usually when he sees a camera he's playful. This time he was really quiet, just glum.' The reason behind the miserable vacation became clear days later, when back home in San Francisco Marsha filed for divorce after 19 years of marriage citing 'irreconcilable differences'. Williams, who was married to first wife Valerie when he hired Marsha as their son Zach's nanny, was by then deeply involved with Charlotte. Sources revealed that Williams and Marsha has been struggling to save their marriage for two years and had quietly decided to separate on New Year's Eve 2007. When contacted by the Enquirer about the affair in April 2008, Charlotte said: 'I can’t comment on any of this stuff.' Pals: Ally Hilfiger (far left) introduced Robin Williams to Charlotte Filbert (far right). The buzz was that Ally was dating Robin, but that wasn't the case . Neither did she deny the relationship with Robin to MailOnline. The relationship with Charlotte, who comes from a well-to-do Maryland family, eventually fizzled out and Robin married third wife, graphic designer Susan Schneider, in 2011. Charlotte later opened an art studio in East Hampton, NY before moving to South Carolina in 2012. Last year she married fellow artist and furniture designer Benjamin Caldwell, 30, in the Florida Keys. She and Caldwell, who is friends with Lady Gaga and has worked on art projects with her, recently welcomed their own baby.","Robin Williams was separated from his second wife when he met stunning artist Charlotte Filbert.

Katie Couric has revealed that she is keeping her wedding plans on the low-key side, saying that her fiance is the one planning the event and it will be limited to family and close friends. It will just be a small dinner in New York,' the talk show host revealed to The Hollywood Reporter at the Sundance Film Festival. 'Actually, he's the wedding planner!' she said of fiance John Molner. The wedding with be the second one for both parties, as Molner is divorced from his first wife, Jane, and Couric lost her first husband, Jay Monahan, to colon cancer in 1998. Just a quiet night in New York: Katie Couric revealed that her fiance John Molner (seen together at the Met Ball) is planning their wedding which will be held at a restaurant in New York . New venture: Couric made the reveal while at the Sundance Film Festival where she has a documentary debuting, seen here on Sunday with her producing partners Stephanie Soechtig and Laurie David . The former Today Show host announced her engagement to her boyfriend of two years over Labor Day Weekend, and while she gleefully showed off the ring on morning shows in September, the formal planning process was put on hold as she had some major career developments over the past few months. Her eponymous afternoon talk show was cancelled after two seasons and now she has been named as Yahoo!'s 'Global Anchor'. The switch led to a pay cut, as her contract with ABC for her talk show was estimated to be around $20million per season and now she will earn $6million through the Yahoo partnership, but the work is expected to be part time.

Couric, 56, was in Utah for the premier of her first such documentary, Fed Up, which looks at the food industry's role in America's obesity problem. She did not give any indication about when her wedding will take place, but when she first announced her engagement, she said that they would likely wait until her younger daughter Carrie leaves for college. Carrie turned 18 on January 5, and will likely graduate this spring meaning that the aforementioned dinner could be happening in the coming months. 'I want to get her off into the world and enjoy her last year at home,' Couric previously said to People magazine.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Rob Ford got stuck in an elevator for 45 minutes today, another unfortunate turn of events for the beleaguered Toronto Mayor who was forced to admit this week that he had an 'unfortunate' slip from sobriety. Ford was on his way to make a speech to the Economic Club of Canada when he became trapped in a freight elevator he had taken with staffers and hotel employees 'to avoid all traffic'. Several members of the business crowd left before Ford's arrival. Ford is having a turbulent week, starting with the emergence of a video showing him slurring his words in an odd rant against Toronto's police chief. Watch Rob Ford in action below . Toronto mayor Rob Ford, pictured on Wednesday, admitted that he had an 'unfortunate slip' from his pledge not to drink after he was caught on camera rambling incoherently in a fast food joint . Ford was caught on camera on Monday night incoherently . rambling in what appears to be a Jamaican accent. A new video was . immediately posted online of Ford swearing and talking about police . surveillance in a fast-food restaurant. Ford, who publicly stated he was giving up alcohol in November after he was mired in a crack-smoking . scandal, offered no apologies for this latest incident on Wednesday . which he calls his 'personal, private setback'. However he will . 'definitely' give up alcohol again, he said . He told the Toronto Sun on Wednesday: 'I had an unfortunate setback, a bump, Monday. I have no excuse, but I am not apologizing for it.' He added that his 'Jamaican patois' accent was not meant to be offensive and he often talks to Jamaican friends this way. With regards his return to drinking, he added: 'You fall off the horse, you get back on the horse. That is what I am doing.' The video is titled 'New Video of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford Drunk, Swearing in Jamaican Patois? Bumbaclot.' On the tape, Ford rants incoherently in . what appears to be an imitation of a Jamaican dialect while throwing a . series of random shapes with his arms. Ford promised to stop drinking in November after being forced to knowledge that he . smoked crack 'in one of my drunken stupors'. Police said they . had obtained a copy of a tape that appeared to show the government official smoking crack. An undated video of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford was posted to YouTube this week where he rambles incoherently in what sounds like an imitation of Jamaican Patois . The Toronto Mayor leaves city hall on Wednesday after an embarrassing video emerged this week, forcing him to admit he had been drinking again . In a TV interview at the time, Ford said: 'I've had a come-to-Jesus moment if you want to call it that. Just the humiliation and the belittling and the people I've let down. 'And it's all because of alcohol. Excessive, stupid, immature behavior and that's it.' Allegations about Ford smoking crack surfaced last May when reporters for the Toronto Star and one from the U.S. website Gawker said they saw the video. Before the mayor admitted the new video had been filmed on Monday, his brother and fellow politician Doug Ford defended him by saying it was not filmed recently because his brother had stopped drinking in November. Doug Ford said: 'He's a lot heavier in that picture than he is now...It couldn't have been last night.' When asked whether it was appropriate for his brother to put on an accent, Doug Ford ducks the question saying he hasn't actually seen the video. Ford gestured wildly and appeared to not know he was being filmed during his drunken rant . Earlier this month, the mayor of Canada's largest city did a 'campaign visit' to downtown nightclub Muzik, setting social media abuzz in the process.

'He stopped drinking in November and he went there, met the people,' Doug Ford earlier told The Toronto Sun. 'There . have been rock stars, there have been sports heroes, there’s been the .

"By . Stephen Mcgowan . Ronny Deila had his ‘Welcome to Glasgow’ moment three weeks ago. The instant when he realised his life was no longer a private affair. Like most of what passes for social interaction in Scotland’s largest city, it happened late one night in a pub in the centre of town. ‘I was outside waiting for a taxi to go home and decided to go into the nearest pub to get a beer,’ recalled the Norwegian. ‘I realise now I shouldn’t do that. ‘I was there for 15 minutes and everyone was very friendly. People wanted to talk to me about Celtic and have their picture taken with me and things like that. ‘It was okay, you get used to that. It’s fantastic that it’s so positive. Nothing has been negative. People tell me they want me to succeed and the Celtic supporters have been amazing. ‘Everyone was very polite — but it was too much.’ Reality check: Ronny Deila's reign as Celtic manager has got off to an eventful start . Deila is reluctant to cut himself off, but realises now there may be no other way. Describing himself as a naturally sociable character, he comes across as a man’s man. Personable and likeable, he pitches up for press conferences in jeans, eschewing the formal informality of a club training kit. As yet, he shows no sign of changing. Two months into the job there is no wariness of the media. No evidence of the Old Firm lobotomy so often performed on Glasgow footballing figures indoctrinated into a life at Celtic or Rangers. A father of twin daughters, his grounded normality is unusual in a working environment where men have been known to lose touch with reality. At Stromsgodset, Deila was used to engagement with fans and journalists. It was a relaxed and undemanding affair. In contrast, Celtic are a very different animal. A club where a degree of detachment is usually encouraged to prevent a manager drowning in the goldfish bowl of Glasgow urban life. ‘Before, I was working almost automatically - but now I have to push myself to new limits,’ he admitted. Saved: Celtic were thrashed by Legia Warsaw, but retained their  Champions League place on a technicality . ‘That’s why I am here and I know I can cope with it. It has been hard but every day has been fantastic also. Everywhere I go, it’s new. ‘I don’t want to find I’m just spinning around in the washing machine. You have to come out of it sometimes to reflect. If you are a leader, you need to reflect. ‘You need time by yourself to see the next step, and you have to always be a step ahead. It’s been hard in the beginning but, over time, it will become easier.’ He made sacrifices to move to Glasgow. The money is certainly better, which helps. But, at 38, Deila finds himself adapting to a new country, a new city, a new working environment to anything he has experienced before. All without the foundation and stability provided by his daughters. ‘My family haven’t come over,’ he revealed. ‘I am not together with the mother of my children. I am single now and my two kids wanted to stay in Norway. ‘They will visit me when they have a vacation and I’ll go see them whenever there is an international break. It’s been the hardest thing, it’s very hard. ‘But when you do this, you sacrifice everything. They wanted me to do this, though, and I couldn’t say no. ‘They knew I’d regret it for the rest of my life if I didn’t come here. But ask any big manager if they made sacrifices and they’ll all say, “Yes”. This is not a job, it’s a lifestyle. Sacrifice: Deila left his family behind at home to take the Celtic job . ‘It’s 24 hours a day, thinking all the time. You can say you’re going home but you’re always doing the job, thinking about it in your mind. There are so many decisions to make all the time that it has to be that way. ‘But with my kids, I asked them what they thought about me coming here, I asked them if it was okay with them. They saw in my face, though, that they couldn’t say no. I think I manipulated them pretty well… . ‘But they are proud of me, I can see that. They are 14 years old and very active, playing handball and football, too. Their mother is fantastic with them, as well, so I know they will be having a good time.’ A more carefree existence, certainly, than their father. The opening weeks of Deila’s Celtic career have been a challenge. The doomsday scenario of an early Champions League exit was a reality until a registration error in Warsaw changed everything. There were dark, sleepless nights after the loss to Poland’s champions. Deila turns a corner in Glasgow and finds the ubiquitous presence of Sky Sports News everywhere he goes – ‘people here are unbelievably interested in football’. For days, he couldn’t escape the impact of a 6-1 aggregate defeat. He was forced to find his own ways of relaxing. ‘For me, training is important,’ he said. ‘I go out running. I also like being with friends and talking with them. ‘I have people visiting me at the moment and that’s good because I’m a social person. I have also got my golf clubs now and have been trying to use them at the course next to where I am staying. ‘Other than that, I just like to relax and watch television, but that’s something I haven’t done for seven weeks. I also haven’t gone to see a movie.’ Today, he takes a long-awaited trip to the theatre. To the football stadium he wants to fulfil his artistic ambitions for the next few years. In the aftermath of his unveiling as manager, the Scandinavian had precious little access to Celtic Park. The Commonwealth Games had the run of the place, the pitch was torn up and the football team were displaced, forced to fulfil a pre-season tour more suited to the Harlem Globetrotters. On Wednesday, Deila finally wondered on to the newly-laid pitch and stood in the centre circle surveying his surroundings ahead of his first home game against Dundee United this lunchtime. ‘It’s going to be huge,’ he admitted. ‘I walked into Celtic Park for the first time since my press conference on Wednesday - it’s okay to go in there to see what to expect. ‘You come to a new country, a new language, a new city. ‘You come to a new staff and new players and you have to cope with that. ‘Everywhere you go is a new place. Even going to your stadium and playing in front of 60,000 people. Pleasing: Celtic won their opening game of the Premiership campaign 3-0 at St Johnstone . ‘These things are what you have to prepare for in your mind and be ready for. ‘I said many times it’s my dream; to play fantastic football against good teams in a full Celtic Park. Money is nothing compared to that. Trophies are nothing compared to that. ‘It’s the ultimate experience and it’s what I have in my mind. ‘Wednesday was the first time I have walked on the Parkhead pitch. ‘I was in the stands for the Barcelona game last year. I had a press conference on my first day. But I hadn’t been since. ‘Now I’m really looking forward to it.’ He travelled to Aberdeen with Football Development Manager John Park to watch Dundee United demolish the home team at Pittodrie last Sunday. He saw nothing to alter some stubbornly held core beliefs. ‘We have better players than the other teams,’ he continued. ‘So we don’t go to Celtic Park and just stay back. ‘If we do, there is something wrong. Then you are afraid to lose. And I am not afraid to lose. “I would rather lose than play bad football. We are talking about Celtic Park now.’ To call somewhere in Scotland ‘home’ will be a strange, but welcome, sensation. An important step on the road to where he wants to be as Celtic manager. ‘There have been some tough weeks here,’ he admitted. ‘But you feel you are living and learning. ‘You can sit in automatic mode and do everything in remote control. ‘But now I have to push myself to new limits – that’s why I did this. Whatever happens here I know I can cope with this now.’","38-year-old Norwegian left home to join Scottish champions .

"By . Margot Peppers for MailOnline . The military is officially changing its hairstyle policy after a petition was launched against the racially biased rules that were formerly in place. In April, the Army received flack after issuing new appearance standards that banned most twists, dreadlocks and large cornrows - styles used predominantly by African-American women with natural hairstyles. Department of Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced on Monday that the Pentagon 'reviewed its definition of authorized and prohibited styles, and eliminated offensive language, including the terms ""matted and unkempt,"" from both the Army and Air Force grooming regulations,' according to Styleite. Scroll down for video . New policy: The military is officially changing its hairstyle policy after a petition was launched against the racially biased rules that were formerly in place. (Pictured: The hairstyles that were banned) Under the new rules, acceptable styles for members of the armed forces - of which a third are black women - have now been extended to include cornrows, twists and larger braids. 'These reviews were informed by a panel of military personnel of mixed demographics reflective of our diverse force,' Hagel wrote in a letter addressed to Congressional Black Caucus chair Rep. Marcia Fudge. Hagel . called for the review in late April after 16 female members of the Congressional . Black Caucus wrote to him, complaining about the updated guidelines. Additionally, more than 11,000 people . signed a White House petition asking President Barack Obama, the . commander in chief, to have the military review the regulations to allow . for 'neat and maintained natural hairstyles.' Fair: Under the new rules, acceptable styles for members of the armed forces - of which a third are black women - have now been extended to include cornrows, twists and larger braids . In their original letter, the Congressional Black Caucus wrote: 'Though we . understand the intent of the updated regulation is to ensure uniformity . in our military, it is seen as discriminatory rules targeting soldiers . who are women of color with little regard to what is needed to maintain . their natural hair.' They also said that the guidelines . calling hairstyles worn mostly by black women 'unkempt' and 'matted' show a lack of 'cultural . sensitivity'. 'I think that it primarily targets black . women, and I’m not in agreement with it,' Patricia Jackson-Kelley from . the National Association of Black Military Women added to the AP. 'I don’t . see how a woman wearing three braids in her hair, how that affects her . ability to perform her duty in the military.' Assessment: Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, pictured in Mexico last week, wrote back to the women to say he took the matter seriously and would be holding a review over the next three months . In a response letter, obtained by the Military Times, Hagel wrote: 'I want to assure you that, while none of . the Army's revised grooming and appearance policies were designed or . intended to discriminate or disparage against any service members, I . take your concerns very seriously.' Pentagon spokesman Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby said Hagel would have the deputy secretary of defense 'work with the service secretaries and military chiefs to review their respective policies' over the following three months. Each service was asked to review its policy 'as they pertain to African American . women to ensure standards are fair and respectful of our diverse force, . while also meeting our military services' requirements', he wrote.","In April, the U.S. issued new appearance standards that banned most twists, dreadlocks and large cornrows .

"By . Corey Charlton for MailOnline . A man has been banned from keeping dogs after he left two Staffordshire bull terriers to rot under a mound of clothing and household items for a year. David Rymell, 33, 'could not face' going into his home after his 15-year-old dog Bud passed away and instead abandoned the carcass and his other dog. He left a decaying Bud in the lounge and shut Weiser, seven, in the kitchen before leaving the home, only returning to collect post. Rymell was banned from keeping dogs for 15 years when he was sentenced at South Tyneside Magistrates Court . The bodies of Rymell's two dogs, Bud and Weiser, were found decomposing in his South Shields home . The two Staffordshire bull terriers were found rotting under a pile of clothes and household items . Rymell was banned from keeping dogs for 15 years, fined, and given a 12 month community order . After eight days Weiser was also found dead. The dogs were only discovered when bailiffs forced their way into the home more than a year later when Rymell, from South Shields, stopped paying rent. Shocked RSPCA officers described the decaying conditions as the worst case they had seen. Rymell, who pleaded guilty to two counts of failing to meet the needs of an animal, was banned from keeping dogs for 15 years. South Tyneside Magistrates’ Court heard RSPCA officers were called after the horrified bailiffs found the dogs’ decomposed carcasses hidden under a pile of clothing and cushions. The scaffolder told police he was so shocked at the death of Bud he could not put himself through going into the house every day. Vets said they could not determine a cause of death for either dog. Denise Jackman, prosecuting, told the court the offences took place between January 2012 and June 2013. The second dog was abandoned after the first dog died and Rymell could not face burying him . Defence lawyer Paul Kennedy told magistrates this was a case of 'short-term neglect' and said Rymell, of Jarrow, Tyne and Wear, showed 'genuine remorse'. 'After the deaths he could not face going into the house, which was being renovated at the time,' Mr Kennedy said. 'The dogs were his life. He does not have children but his dogs were effectively his children. 'He loved for them, cared for them and fed them. He has indicated to me that he is not interested in getting another dog because he will never be able to replace the ones he had.' Speaking after the case, RSPCA inspector Catherine Richardson said: 'It’s a great result for us, in particular the disqualification. 'It means we don’t have to worry about another dog going through the same thing. 'I’ve been an inspector for two years and this is the worst case I’ve seen. It’s a shame that by the time we found out about it both dogs were already dead.' Rymell was given a 12-month community order with a 200-hour unpaid work requirement, and was fined £260.","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"By . Brian Lee for MailOnline . Follow @@brianwlee1 . Arsenal are in Turkey as Arsene Wenger's side look to make the Champions League group stages for a 17th successive season. The Gunners are favourites to get past Besiktas in this play-off after beating Manchester City to lift the Community Shield and getting off to a winning the start in the Premier League thanks to Aaron Ramsey's late strike against Crystal Palace. Bring it on: Arsenal players were in relaxed mood as they trained before heading for Istanbul on Monday . The Turks qualified by beating Feyenoord over two legs with former Chelsea striker Demba Ba, who was close to joining Arsenal last year, scoring a hat-trick in the second leg against the Dutch outfit. The home side will also have 76,000 screaming fans behind them. Here is everything you need to know about tonight's showdown in Istanbul. Besiktas vs Arsenal (Ataturk Olympic Stadium) Kick-off: Tuesday 7.45pm - ITV1 . Odds (subject to change) Besiktas 4/1 . Draw 11/4 . Arsenal 8/11 . Referee: Milorad Mazic (Serbia) Arsenal team news . The Gunners will be without defender Kieran Gibbs (hamstring) in Istanbul. Centre-back Laurent Koscielny has shrugged off an achilles problem and midfielder Mathieu Flamini returns after missing the Barclays Premier League win over Crystal Palace, but forward Yaya Sanogo (hamstring) did not travel. German World Cup winners Mesut Ozil, Per Mertesacker and Lukas Podolski are all yet to be involved, while goalkeeper David Ospina (thigh), Theo Walcott and Serge Gnabry (both knee) continue their rehabilitation. Atiba Hutchinson is giving Besiktas boss Slaven Bilic cause for concern with the midfielder rated a 50-50 chance. Provisional Arsenal  squad: Szczesny, Monreal, Chambers, Koscielny, Debuchy, Cazorla, Sanchez, Ramsey, Wilshere, Arteta, Giroud, Martinez, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Rosicky, Campbell, Coquelin, Flamini, Bellerin. Likely line-ups: How the teams could take to the field when Arsenal tackle Besiktas in Turkey . Key match stats (supplied by Opta) Arsenal have won all 12 of their Champions League qualifying games so far. The Gunners have netted 29 goals in those 12 games, an average of 2.4 goals per game while they have shipped only three in total, keeping nine clean sheets. This is the second time in two seasons that the North Londoners face Turkish opposition in the Champions League play-offs, having beaten Fenerbahce last season, 3-0 away and then 2-0 at home. Arsenal have met Turkish sides seven times, winning four and drawing three, with one of the draws ended in penalty shoot-out defeat vs Galatasaray in the 2000 UEFA Cup final. Besitkas have lost just one of their 16 Champions League qualifying games, winning 10 and drawing five.

The Turkish side have won just four of their 14 clashes with English sides in Europe (incl. qualifiers), losing seven and drawing three. Aaron Ramsey bagged three goals in the Gunners’ two CL qualifiers against Fenerbahce last season while he is currently on a streak of scoring in each of his last four games for Arsenal in all competitions. Besiktas’ summer-signing Demba Ba bagged two goals in five games against Arsenal (in all comps), with those goals coming courtesy of a brace for Newcastle in the Magpies’ 7-3 loss against the Gunners in December 2012.

Ian Fleming built his villa on the site of a former donkey race track . Fleming bought the 15 acre plot, which . had formerly been a donkey race track, in 1946 after hearing about the . the property from a friend. His villa, which overhangs the sea was based . on a sketch he made. The property, near the town of Oracabessa, was also owned by Reggae superstar Bob marley who purchased it in 1976,12 years after Fleming's death. Marley then sold the property to the current owner, Chris Blackwell, founder of the Island record label, who used it as a place to entertain friends before opening a small hotel.

"By . Mike Dawes . ESPN have suspended outspoken sportscaster Stephen A. Smith for a week because of his comments about domestic abuse suggesting women should make sure that they don't do anything to provoke an attack. Smith's commentary occurred during a discussion on ESPN2's ""First Take"" last Friday about the NFL's two-game suspension of Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice following charges he assaulted his now-wife. The remarks attracted widespread attention, including a stinging rebuke online from a fellow ESPN personality. Smith issued an on-air apology on Monday, saying it was the most egregious mistake of his career. Punished: Stephen A. Smith will not be allowed to appear on ESPN for the next week . A day later, ESPN took action. The network's chief executive, John Skipper, told ESPN's staff in a memo it was done after a ""thoughtful discussion"" about appropriate actions with men and women in his company. 'I believe his apology was sincere and that he and we have learned from what we've collectively experienced,' Skipper said. Smith will not appear on ""First Take"" or ESPN radio until August 6, the network said. During the Rice discussion, Smith alluded to women in abuse cases when he said, 'Let's make sure we don't do anything to provoke wrong action ... we got to also make sure that you can do your part to do whatever you can do to make, to try to make sure it doesn't happen again.' Topic of conversation: Smith was suspended for comments he made on Ravens running back Ray Rice (right) Shortly after Smith's remarks, colleague Michelle Beadle responded on Twitter that: 'I was just forced to watch this morning's First Take. A) I'll never feel clean again B) I'm not aware that I can provoke my own beating.' Beadle, host of ESPN2's ""SportsNation,"" continued with a series of tweets. She said that: 'Violence isn't the victim's issue. It's the abuser's. To insinuate otherwise is irresponsible and disgusting.' Smith, during his apology, said it wasn't his intention to say that women could be responsible for their own abuse. 'It was not what I was trying to say,' he said. 'Yet the failure to clearly articulate something different lies squarely on my shoulder.' Smith didn't explain the point that he was trying to make. ESPN frowns upon its personalities attacking each other on social media or other forums. But it did not announce any punishment for Beadle.","ESPN sportscaster Stephen A.

"By . Sophie Borland Health Reporter . NHS staff are illegally accepting cash from health tourists to give them access to free hospital treatment, an investigation has found. It has uncovered a thriving black  market in which foreign patients are buying their way on to GP surgery lists for up to £1,000 a time. Once registered with a practice, patients are being seen by GPs and then referred for hospital treatment worth tens of thousands of pounds. 'Black market': Undercover reporters found foreign patients could buy their way onto GP surgery lists (file photo) The investigation by the BBC’s Panorama programme found one manager at a surgery in the West Midlands was offering to register an entire family from India for £5,000. He also took £800 from a female undercover reporter posing as a health tourist to put her on the practice’s list. The reporter claimed to be an Indian patient suffering from the back condition sciatica, which wouldn’t merit free treatment as it isn’t deemed urgent. But she was subsequently referred to hospital for an MRI scan that would have cost the NHS £800 – the same as the cost of her place on the list. The unidentified manager told her it was ‘good business’ as she had already got her money back with the cost of the scan – and would be likely to benefit from more expensive treatment. The manager said: ‘Just with the scan you’ve made your money.’ The investigation also discovered that ‘fixers’ – who aren’t employed by the NHS – are putting overseas patients on GP lists in exchange for cash. These individuals are likely to have close ties with managers or doctors within the surgery who agree to register the patients. An undercover reporter posing as a Kosovan illegal immigrant bought a place for £200 through a fixer in Southall, West London, and was later given free X-rays at hospital. And another unidentified fixer selling places on practice lists in London said: ‘Once you have a GP in this country, there is nothing you want to do that you can’t do.’ Tory MP Chris Skidmore, who is campaigning for tougher regulation on health tourism, said: ‘This is nothing short of abuse of precious NHS resources. It’s highly irresponsible of somebody to be making money out of patients who are vulnerable. ‘The law is clear: if you’re not eligible for free treatment then you should be paying for it.’ Earlier this year an investigation . by Pulse magazine estimated that over the last three years health . tourists had been given free hospital treatment worth £40million. By law, only patients who have lived in the UK for the past year are entitled to free hospital treatment on the NHS. Health Minister: 'We've got to tighten up the system', Anna Soubry has said . Treatment . at hospital A&E units and walk in clinics is also free. GPs have . discretion about whether or not to charge patients who are not on their . lists depending on how urgent the patient’s case is considered. Hospital . staff are meant to check patients have been living in the UK for the . past 12 months before treating them, but many do not do so. So . it is probable that once a patient has been registered with a GP – even . at a price – he or she will have access to free hospital care worth . thousands of pounds without having to pay. The . Panorama investigation found that a third of 133 hospital trusts who . replied to Freedom of Information requests did not check whether . patients were entitled to treatment. Health minister Anna Soubry admitted she was ‘surprised it’s not more than that’. Speaking . on the programme, she said: ‘We know there are abuses but we know that . some GP practices put quite strict rules and regulations in place before . they will accept somebody on their books. ‘And we know that we’ve got to tighten up the system, that’s why we’re having a review.’ Dr Vivienne Nathanson, head of ethics and science at the British Medical Association, said: ‘Nobody likes people gaming the system – coming to the UK and thinking they can just get access to things they wouldn’t be able to access in other countries.’ In June it emerged that one unnamed foreign patient who was being cared for by Barts Health NHS Trust in London had fled owing around £500,000 in medical bills. In another case Nigerian-born Bimbo Ayelabola flew to the UK to give birth to quintuplets and received around £200,000 in NHS care. She is married to a wealthy businessman and is thought still to be living in the UK, fighting deportation.","Panorama investigation uncovered a black market serving foreign patients eager to buy their way onto GP surgery lists .

"By . Kerry Mcdermott . A dog who had its front paws cut off by callous members of a Mexican drug gang is able to play and run once more after being fitted with prosthetic legs. The sweetly-named Pay de Limon - or Lemon Pie - was discovered whining and bleeding in a dumpster after its run-in with heartless criminals in Mexico City in 2011. A year on the plucky pooch has recovered well thanks to the efforts of the Milagros Caninos - Canine Miracles - rescue centre in the Mexican capital, which raised almost £4,000 to pay for Pay de Limon's new legs. Scroll down for video . Back on its feet: Pay de Limon, whose two front paws were chopped off, bounds along outside a Mexican rescue shelter with the help of his new prosthetic legs . The founder of the rescue shelter claimed Pay de Limon's horrifying injuries were the work of criminals using the dog to 'practice' the torturous treatments dished out to kidnap victims by members of Mexico's notorious drug cartels. 'Pay de Limon had the misfortune of running into an organised crime group and they used him to practice cutting off each one of his paws, like they do when they cut fingers off human beings that have been kidnapped,' Patricia Ruiz told Reuters. Kidnaps are a regular occurrence in . Mexico, with victims snatched by drug gangs to try and extort money from . their families, or sometimes to be forced into working for the cartels. The mutilated dog was brought to . Milagros Caninos after being found abandoned in a dumpster by passersby . in the Fresnillo district of Mexico City. Staff at the rescue shelter worked to . nurse Pay de Limon back to health, and raised more than $6,000 in . donations to pay for the prosthetic limbs that would allow him to walk . again. Because no facilities exist in Mexico . for fitting dogs with prosthetic legs, moulds of Pay de Limon's legs . were sent to a company in Colorado, U.S., that specialises in braces and . prosethetics for dogs and other animals. As Pay de Limon grew accustomed to . wearing the prosthetics the dog gradually spent more time each day . wearing them, and staff say it now regularly trots around with the help of its new legs.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Pensions minister Steve Webb said he did not want to force people to work 'until they drop' but employers needed to realise the 'untapped potential' in older staff . A shortage of workers will mean people will have to stay in jobs until they are at least 70, ministers claim. Employers are warned they must change their attitudes towards older workers, who ‘already live here and their numbers are growing’. The government says Britain is ‘running out of workers, with 13.5million vacancies predicted in the next decade but only 7million young people due to leave school and college. Ministers believe the gap can be filled by older people staying in the workplace for longer. Around 22 per cent of people are aged over 60, but by 2035 it is expected to rise to 28 per cent. Pensions minister Steve Webb said: ‘People have often said, 'how are we going to tackle ageist attitudes amongst employers?’ The demographics are going to sort that out for us. ‘Over time there will be a whole set of jobs where employers need experienced older workers and a firm that doesn’t change its attitude to older workers will be left behind,’ he told the Daily Telegraph. A new guide, Employing Older Workers, has been produced by the government to encourage bosses to keep experienced staff. It says: ‘Older people are the main untapped source of labour: unlike migrants, they already live here, and their numbers are growing. ‘People are living and keeping fit for longer: most of today’s  65-year-olds will live beyond 80, and some will live beyond 110. The number of over-60s is expected to rise sharply in the next two decades, reaching 17.5million by 2035 . McDonald's said output was 20 per cent higher in restaurants where staff included over-60s . ‘Older workers are increasingly looking to extend their working lives, with over 50 per cent of workers aged 55 plus planning to work beyond the state pension age.’ The report highlights how some firms have reaslied the benefits of older staff. McDonald’s reports 20 per cent higher performance in outlets where workers aged over 60 are employed as part of a ‘multigenerational workforce’. David Fairhurst, McDonald’s UK & Northern Europe, said: 'Changing demographics in the workplace mean that later life workers are now the fastest growing age group in the labour market. 'Yet despite the growing numbers of mature workers, their contribution to business and the wider economy often goes unsung. 'It might surprise people to learn that at McDonald’s we employ over 1,000 people aged 60 and above. These employees play an important role in our business and, as the research shows, they make a huge impact on customer satisfaction.' Mr Webb insisted he did not want to force people to work into their seventies and beyond. He added: ‘This isn’t “work ‘til you drop”. This is actually enabling people to carry on and in most cases that is good for their wellbeing as well. ‘It is not the case that if we enable firms to employ older workers this just shuts out the young. It keeps experienced productive workers in the workforce and that is good news.’","Experts predict 13.5m extra jobs over 20 years but only 7m school leavers .

"By . Alex Gore . British jobs could be at risk when nearly 30 million Bulgarians and Romanians gain the right to live and work unrestricted in the UK from 2014. Experts are warning of a 'significant spike' of newcomers when limitations on coming to Britain, which have been imposed on the citizens of the two countries by the European Union, are lifted at the end of next year. They believe the numbers will be higher than those seen after Poland and seven other eastern European countries were given the same rights in 2004 because of the fragile state of economies on the continent. Spike: Bulgarians and Romanians are set to gain unrestricted access to the UK . Home Secretary Theresa May has indicated support for an end to free movement of EU workers - but Britain cannot stop the restrictions being lifted without tearing up the treaty signed with Bulgaria and Romania when they joined the EU in 2007. The Government has not made official predictions of how many Bulgarians and Romanians will move here and critics say this is because it grossly underestimated the numbers in 2004. It predicted less than 20,000 would arrive but Office for National Statistics figures show more than 600,000 were working in Britain last year. A report by the Coalition's Migration . Advisory Committee has highlighted fears that the British jobs market will suffer 'adverse' effects. Cambridge University emeritus economics professor, Robert Rowthorn, explained around one million eastern Europeans moved to Britain in 2004 and said net migration is around 40,000 a year. He told The Sunday Telegraph: 'I imagine a similar pattern will be repeated with Romania and Bulgaria, although the transitional controls have perhaps taken the edge off somewhat.' Union: Britain would have to tear up an EU treaty to stop restrictions being lifted . MigrationWatch UK director, Sir Andrew Green, said Britain has taken far more eastern European migrants than any other country and called for a delay in the lifting of restrictions. He added: 'I think there could be a significant spike from Romania and Bulgaria, particularly as the economies in other parts of the EU are suffering serious difficulties. 'Neither Spain nor Italy are a good bet at the moment if you’re looking for a job. I think we need a further five year extension of the transitional arrangements.' Figures show nearly 40,000 Bulgarians and Romanians moved to the UK last year, with more than 130,000 living in Britain - where the GDP per capita is nearly four times higher. An investigation by The Sunday Telegraph revealed that loopholes allowed 50,000 east Europeans to get jobs they should have been restricted from by declaring themselves 'self-employed'. These included hotel and restaurant workers, sales staff, tax-drivers and lap-dancers - with many thousands of such jobs being advertised in the two countries. Jobs: Eastern European immigrants are likely to shun other countries for the UK .","Experts warn of a 'significant spike' when limitations imposed by the EU are lifted at the end of next year .

"By . David Rohde For Reuters . Somewhere in the desert of eastern Syria, a militant from the Islamic State beheaded the American journalist James Foley this week. The killer and his terrorist group are responsible for Foley’s death. They should be the focus of public anger. But Foley’s execution is also a chilling wake-up call for American and European policymakers, as well as U.S. news outlets and aid organizations. It is the clearest evidence yet of how vastly different responses to kidnappings by U.S. and European governments save European hostages but can doom the Americans. Hostages and their families realize this fully — even if the public does not. Free: Didier Francois, (center) and Nicolas Henin (right, on the day they were released with Eduoard Elias) in May . Freedom: El Mundo correspondent Javier Espinosa (R) and freelance photographer Ricardo Garcia Vilanova arrive at the military airbase in Torrejon de Ardoz, near Madrid following their release . 'I wish I could have the hope of freedom and seeing my family once again, but that ship has sailed,' Foley said moments before he was killed in a craven video released by the militant group on Tuesday. 'I guess, all in all, I wish I wasn’t American.' Foley clearly spoke under duress. But his regret at being an American captive, real or not, reflected grim fact. This spring, four French and two Spanish journalists held hostage by the Islamic State extremists were freed — after the French and Spanish governments paid ransoms through intermediaries. Controversial theory: Reuters' David Rohde describes his kidnapping and hostage period in Pakistan in Washington last year . The US government refused to negotiate or pay a ransom in Foley’s case or for any other American captives — including my own abduction by the Taliban five years ago.] . With the help of an Afghan journalist abducted with me, I was lucky enough to  escape. But today Foley is dead and the Islamic State militants now say Steven Sotloff, a journalist for Time magazine whom the group also captured, will be killed if the United States does not stop bombing its fighters in Iraq. There are no easy answers in kidnapping cases. The United States cannot allow terrorist groups to control its foreign policy. One clear lesson that has emerged in recent years, however, is that security threats are more effectively countered by united American and European action. The divergent US and European approach to abductions fails to deter captors or consistently safeguard victims. Last . month, a New York Times investigation found that al Qaeda and its . direct affiliates had received at least $125 million in revenue from . kidnappings since 2008 — primarily from European governments. In the . last year alone, they received $66 million. 'Kidnapping . hostages is an easy spoil,' Nasser al-Wuhayshi, the leader of al Qaeda . in the Arabian Peninsula, wrote in a 2012 letter to the leader of an al . Qaeda affiliate in North Africa, 'which I may describe as a profitable . trade and a precious treasure.' Flow of terror funds: Switzerland, France, Austria and Spain are accused of paying ransoms to terrorist groups along with Qatar and Oman . Authorized mission: Obama delivered a statement from Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, during his vacation on Wednesday. Hours later it was revealed he authorized a mission in July to save James Foley. It failed . Frightening: James Wright Foley tenses as his executioner addresses the camera who says this act of revenge is in responce to US airstrikes on Iraq . Publicly, European governments deny making these payments. But former diplomats told the Times that ransoms have been paid through intermediaries. Kidnapping as a fundraising tactic is thriving and rates are going up. In 2003, a ransom of roughly $200,000 was paid for each captive, the newspaper found. Today, captors reap millions per captive. Abductions have become so lucrative that al Qaeda leaders in Pakistan help oversee negotiations for affiliates. Militants groups spread across North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia are now following the same rough protocol. Watch Video Here . Dignified: Diane and John Foley talked to reporters after the death of their son, photojournalist James Foley, at the hands of ISIS . Hostage-taking by extremist groups is now so pervasive that at least one major aid organization is not sending US aid workers to areas where they might be abducted. Instead, they are sending citizens from European countries with governments that will pay ransoms. The cases have taken on a grim pattern: Hostages are abducted, months pass with no news from the captors and a threatening video or email is then sent to families. In some cases, the militants ask that cases not be made public so ransom can be paid quietly. FRANCE   $58.1m . QATAR AND OMAN  $20.4m . SWITZERLAND   $12.4m . SPAIN   $11m . AUSTRIA   $3.2m . This was the case in Foley’s tortuous, 21-month abduction. For the first 16 months after Foley was taken captive, his family had no information regarding his whereabouts. They learned he was alive from two Spanish journalists who were freed by the Islamic State in March after a ransom was paid. In a subsequent email message, the captors instructed the family to keep the case quiet and not identify the Islamic State as the kidnappers. Fearing for Foley’s life, the family obeyed. Other American families with loved ones taken captive by militants have done the same. Privately, the Foleys and other families have grown intensely frustrated with the failure of American officials to negotiate with the captors. Ransom: . It has emerged that ISIS demanded a staggering $132m ransom for the . return of Foley. Philip Balboni, the CEO and co-founder of GlobalPost, . the Boston-based website that Foley was reporting for when he was . captured told MailOnline it was considerably higher than for European . captives 'purely because he was an American . US government officials also refused to coordinate their response in any way with European governments. In the days and weeks ahead, the Foley family will speak for themselves about their ordeal. But the payment of ransoms and abduction of foreigners must emerge from the shadows. It must be publicly debated. American and European policymakers should be forced to answer for their actions. Foley believed that his government would help him, according to his family. In a message that was not made public, Foley said that he believed so strongly that Washington would help that he refused to allow his fellow American captives to not believe in their government. A consistent response to kidnapping by the U.S. and Europe is desperately needed. The current haphazard approach is failing. James Foley must not die in vain.","American journalist David Rohde believes America's policy of not negotiating with terrorists needs to change .

"By . Christian Gysin . Jailed: Ruth Nabuguzi was the ringleader of a 'family firm' that carried out a £4million benefits scam . A judge accused a family of African . fraudsters of an ‘outrageous abuse of the hospitality’ shown to them by . Britain as they were jailed yesterday for stealing £4million from . taxpayers. The 20-year scam included one of the . fraud ringleaders creating fake identities for up to 100 children to . milk the benefits system. Ruth Nagubuzi also claimed to have HIV . and Aids in order to receive costly drugs which she then sent back to . Uganda for huge profits. It was estimated that supplying the . medicines to the 49-year-old, as well as four other made-up ‘sufferers’, . cost the taxpayer more than £2million. A further £154,000 went on education for members of the ‘family’, with £37,500 for a single higher education course. Fraud relating to accommodation costs . and sub-letting of flats by Nagubuzi cost £650,000, and the family’s . benefits including child allowances, disability benefits, and council . tax and tax credits totalled £900,000. The gang’s gains were spent on a . complex consisting of luxury apartments, shops, restaurants and a hotel . in Nagubuzi’s home city of Kampala, the Ugandan capital. Plans for . building new properties were found when police raided the gang’s homes . across East London. The Daily Mail told last week how in a . campaign of deceit lasting more than two decades their ‘family . business’ saw them ‘conspire together to create, use and exploit’ false . identities to carry out the staggering fraud. Yesterday eight of the group were . sentenced to a total of 19 years by Judge Nicholas Ainley at Croydon . Crown Court in South London. He told Nagubuzi: ‘This was a fraud on . a huge scale and it is an outrageous abuse of the hospitality you were . offered by this country when you came here in trouble. Nabaguzi is believed to have regularly travelled back to Uganda and bought at least three properties in and around the capital Kampala, one of them pictured . The luxury flats in Kampala, Uganda, that were built using the proceeds of the scam . Another luxury house in Uganda that was paid for using money that was illegally obtained in Britain . ‘The identities you used and no doubt . sold were then used by other people. You had no scruples in bringing . children to this country and then involving them in your criminal . pursuits. This was motivated entirely by greed. All these identities . were, for you, valuable commodities.’ The use of so many names to perpetuate . the fraud led one investigator to remark: ‘The true figure of what . these people stole from us may never be known. It could be in excess of . £6million after they launched a systematic assault on our welfare . system.’ During a six-week trial four . defendants, all from East London, pleaded not guilty to a string of . fraud and asylum application offences. Dennis Kyeyune, 29, and Lamulah . Sekiziyuvu, 36, were both given sentences totalling 30 months, while . Jordan Sebutemba, 26 – a mother of children aged five and 11 months – . was spared jail and given a one-year sentence suspended for two years. The judge told both Kyeyune and . Sebutemba: ‘It must have been dispiriting for the jury to listen to both . of you in the witness box just lying and lying consistently. Kyeyune . held much of the paperwork and Sebutemba, you were a trusted . confederate.’ Nabuguzi, 49, from Manor Park, east London and . her family, fooled immigration officials and obtained leave to remain in . the UK under a number of different identities . Albert Kaidi, 27, was also given a . 30-month sentence and told he had ‘lied’ about being from Rwanda when he . was a native of Uganda. Yesterday those found guilty were . joined in the dock by four other gang members who had earlier pleaded . guilty to numerous offences. The other guilty fraudsters included . Nagubuzi, who managed to claim £2,280,000 in HIV/Aids medication for . herself and in four other identities, which investigators believe she . has sold for vast profit in Uganda. Nagubuzi was given a total of six . years imprisonment and told that an immigration tribunal would look at . her right to remain in the UK. Dennis Kyeyune, left, believed to be the ringleader's son and Albert Kaidi one of the nine members of the family .

Matumba, 50 – whose real name is believed to be Yvette Syapjeu – was . given a four-year jail term for using a number of false identities to . steal more than £350,000 in benefits payments since coming to Britain in . 1998. Nurse Lina Katongola, 29, was given a . one-year prison term and Eddie Semanda, 31, was given a four-month . prison term, suspended for one year, over a false naturalisation . application. Paul Raudnitz, prosecuting, said: ‘The . tentacles of this fraud went far and wide for many, many years. Each . defendant at different times joined the conspiracy.’ He said ‘key . player’ Nagubuzi ‘employed multiple identities ... so many that the true . number of identities may never ever be known’. Nagubuzi’s claims for Aids drugs . netted her millions and she even sub-let flats in East London which saw . her pocket a further £650,000. She received almost £500,000 in housing . benefit alone from Newham Council. Nagubuzi came to the UK in 1991 and . claimed asylum for herself and four children she had left in Uganda. Three years later she used the name Jane Namusisi to apply for asylum . again – along with two more children. In 1999, using the name Pauline . Zalwango, she applied once more, this time with three children. She is believed to have regularly travelled to Uganda and bought at least three properties around Kampala. When police searched the East London . home of Dennis Kyeyune – thought to be Nagubuzi’s son or nephew – they . found a black holdall containing a vast array of fake documents, . described as a ‘kitbag for the commission of identity fraud’. The judge said that there would be a confiscation hearing at a later date under Proceeds of Crime legislation. Church Road, Manor Park in east London where the ringleader lived as she scammed benefit money . Investigators from the UK Border . Agency have visited Kampala to try to identify properties bought by . Nagubuzi and her gang. However, it is believed that in a bid to avoid . land registry detection in the African country she has ordered that some . of her homes are not finished by builders so they cannot be officially . ‘signed off’ by building inspectors. Tony Erne, from the UK Border Agency, said: 'This was a major criminal operation dating back several years. Ruth Nabuguzi and her co-conspirators thought they could get away with it but our officers, working closely with other agencies, smashed their web of deceit.'These sentences show that abuse of our immigration system for profit will not be tolerated.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The story of rural life in the hill country of North Mississippi is told in an astonishing collection of photographs taken in the early 1970s, which are now being honored with a 40-year retrospective to ensure that these images of a way of life that died out long ago may live on. The photographs also tell the story of Michael Ford, who captured them after quitting his teaching job in Boston and packing his young family into a cherry-red Volkswagen microbus and making his home in Oxford, Mississippi. Initially Ford's plan had been just to visit his in-laws in northern Mississippi, but he quickly became so smitten with the place that he decided to stay.

But I learned and was given the luck, or grace perhaps, to find… oases where the past was well and alive and welcoming,’ said Ford.

"By . Amanda Williams . Leyton Orient football player Billy Lobjoit outside St Albans Crown Court in Hertfordshire. He used his own car as a getaway vehicle . A promising young footballer used his own Smart Car as a getaway vehicle after his friend carried out armed robberies. Billy Lobjoit, a striker with League one side Leyton Orient, drove his friend away from the scene of two armed holdups and shops. After the second police had a description that the robbers were using a distinctive white Smart Car. As a result police responding to a 999 call quickly discovered the vehicle and Lobjoyt was arrested. At St Albans crown court Lobjoit, 19, was given a suspended sentence when he appeared in the dock to admit two offences of robbery. But judge John Plumstead also told him that for the next six months he would not be allowed to go into licensed premises on Fridays and Saturday after 7pm. The judge said it meant he would not be able to go drinking with team mates after a match. In addition Lobjoit was handed an 18 month jail sentence which was suspended for two years, disqualified from driving for two years and ordered to pay compensation of £395 to victims of the robberies. His co defendant and friend Sam Rothery 19 who had actually gone into the shops with his face disguised behind a mask and wearing a beanie hat was jailed for 29 months and 27 days. Judge Plumstead passed the sentence after being told Rothery wanted to rejoin the army and there was a chance he would be accepted if he received a sentence under 30 months. Rothery of Borehamwood admitted four charges of robbery and two of possessing a bladed article. The court heard it was on the 12th of November when on his own he carried out a knife point robbery at the Co-op store in Bishops Rise, Hatfield. He was on his own and after jumping over the counter snatched £429 from the till and 12 packs of tobacco worth £50. Then on November 15 he carried out a second lone robbery on the Co-op store in Organ Hall Road, Borehamwood, Herts . On this occasion he took a bottle of champagne and more cigarettes. Twenty minutes later and having enlisted the help of his friend Lobjoyt he staged another robbery at the Londis Store in High Street, Elstree. It was just after 8pm and on this occasion he took a bottle of Bells whiskey and more packets of cigarettes. As he left the store he was seen to get into a white Smart Car driven by Lobjoit of Park Street, St Albans. Then at 9.15pm that same evening Rothery staged another robbery at the Co-op store in park Street St Albans and took £450 from the till. Billy Lobjoit's Smartcar which was used in the robbery (on the right, white car) from Facebook. The court heard Lobjoit had not known initially that his friend would be committing robberies armed with a knife . Lobjoit was handed an 18 month jail sentence which was suspended for two years, disqualified from driving for two years and ordered to pay compensation of £395 to victims of the robberies . Lobjoit's (pictured in action) co defendant and friend Sam Rothery (not pictured) was jailed for 29 months and 27 days . Once more Lobjoit was outside in the Smart car which was registered to him. Witnesses saw Rothery free from the shop and jump into the vehicle. For six months he is banned from licensed premises on Fridays and Saturday after 7pm. Judge said it meant he would 'not be able to go drinking with team mates' Details of the vehicle were given to police and it wasn't long afterwards that officers saw the car in Chippendale Lane St Albans and stopped it. Rothery ran off from the scene, but gave himself up a few days later.Lobjoit was arrested saying his friend had given him £90 to drive him that night. The court was told that Rothery had been a promising young soldier but had left the army to look after his mum who was suffering from severe depression. But unable to find work he had fallen into the wrong crowd and as a result found himself in debt to serious criminals. It was because of that he had committed the robberies as a way of paying them off. Sentencing the pair Judge Plumstead told Rothery he hoped that by sending him to prison for a day short of thirty months, it might help him get back into the army. He told Lobjoit that when Rothery had approached him for help that evening, he hadn't known initially that he would be committing robberies armed with a knife. 'You drove your own car and this wasn't thought through and this wasn't sophisticated.' He told them people in stores and shops late at night performed a vital role in the community and were vulnerable and deserved the protection of the courts.","Billy Lobjoit is a striker with League one side Leyton Orient .

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . A miniscule copy of the Bible which has travelled to the Moon is expected to sell for £35,000. The tiny book, one of only a few objects to go into space twice, was sent into orbit with Apollo 13 in 1970. When the mission went wrong and the trip to the Moon was aborted, the astronauts may have used the Bible to pray. It was recovered when they splashed down in the Pacific. The tiny book, one of only a few objects to go into space twice, was sent into orbit with Apollo 13 in 1970 . The lunar Bible, which can only be read . by microscope, was sent back up the following year with Apollo 14, . finally landing on the Moon among the personal belongings of astronaut . Edgar Mitchell. The Bible was one of 512 made by the Apollo Prayer League, a group of Christians with ties to the US space programme. They were first produced in the wake of the Apollo 1 disaster, in which three astronauts were killed when a fire broke out on-board during a launch rehearsal. It had been the dream of one of the astronauts, Ed White, to take a Bible into space, so the Apollo Prayer League took on the challenge in his memory. They used microform technology to shrink the Bible's 1,245 pages to just 1.5 inches which could then be read under a microscope. Bibles were sent up with the Apollo 12 and 13 missions but both attempts to land on the Moon were thwarted. After two failed attempts, the Apollo Prayer League, led by Reverend John Stout, finally succeeded in 1971 with Apollo 14. Lunar module operator Mitchell stowed 100 bibles among a small bag of belongings that he took on the successful moon landing on February 5, 1971. The Bible was one of 512 made by the Apollo Prayer League, a group of Christians with ties to the US space programme . The Bible for sale is one of only 12 lunar Bibles verified by Mitchell and comes with a certificate of authenticity. It is tipped to fetch £35,000 when it goes under the hammer in Dallas on Wednesday. Michael Riley, a historian at Heritage Auctions, said: 'The lunar Bible was invented by the Apollo Prayer League, a group of people in Houston led by Reverend John Stout who prayed for the astronauts. 'Using microform technology they were able to shrink a full copy of the Bible to a size small enough to be transported to space with an astronaut. 'The idea behind it was simply to take God's words to the moon. 'For the Apollo 14 flight 300 lunar Bibles were sent, and this particular one was among the 100 stowed in Edgsar Mitchell's personal preference kit when he landed on the moon. 'This copy has an unbroken line of provenance, having been given by John Stout to his brother James, and it has been certified by them both, as well as by Edgar Mitchell. 'This Bible is one of the few objects ever to go into space twice, which makes it a real rarity. 'Collectors go crazy for memorabilia from the Apollo 13 mission on its own but this Bible then went back to space with Apollo 14. 'That makes it a pretty special item.' It goes under the hammer at auction in Dallas on Wednesday.","The miniscule copy of the Bible was sent to orbit with Apollo 13 in 1970 .

"By . Louise Boyle . California native Steven Beitashour is playing for his parents' home country of Iran during the FIFA World Cup 2014 (pictured in his Iranian kit) An American soccer player who wasn't picked for the U.S. World Cup team is playing for his parents' native country Iran. Steven Beitashour, who was born in San Jose, California, is the only American playing for the Iranians in Brazil this summer - a decision which has outraged some fans. The 27-year-old player, whose current club is the Vancouver Whitecaps, is able to play for Iran because his parents were born in the Islamic state. He told the San Jose Mercury News: 'I'm not there to cause any problems. I'm not there for any flash. I'm there for the love of the game.' He told the paper that he understands Farsi more than he speaks but hoped his decision would help improve U.S.-Iranian relations. Despite his own neutrality, Beitashour's decision to play for Iran has drawn strong criticism. One fan accused him of 'selling his soul' for the chance to play at the World Cup, according to the New York Times, while another Bob Bagheri tweeted: 'You are a disgrace to America. Shame on u. I was born in Iran and left in 1979, and would never play for Iran.' Despite reports today that the U.S. and Iran could join forces for a military operation over . deteriorating security conditions in Iraq, the two countries have a . hostile history. In . 1979, a diplomatic crisis was sparked after 66 Americans were held . hostage in the country for 444 days. More recently, Iran has been . subjected to heavy U.S. sanctions over its nuclear program. Beitashour's parents, Edward and Pari, immigrated from Iran to the U.S. in the 1960s. Soccer players qualify to play for other countries if they have a parent or grandparent from that country. U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann has selected seven foreigners for Team USA . Although Beitashour attended U.S. national team training camps in August 2012 and the . following January, he never got into a game. Iran and Nigeria line up prior to their game at Arena da Baixada in Curitiba, Brazil on Monday . Iran's players, including Steven Beitashour (front row, second left) pose for a team photo prior to the friendly football match Iran vs Angola in preparation for the FIFA World Cup 2014 on May 30 . In October 2013, Beitashour made the decision to join Iran who face Argentina, Nigeria and . Bosnia and Herzegovina in Group F at this year's World Cup. The player did not start for Iran in today's match against Nigeria. Iran has a 2,000-1 shot to win the World Cup. Beitashour started his career at the San Diego State Aztecs, going on to . play professionally for the San Jose Frogs and San Jose Earthquakes . before ending up in Vancouver. Although he is the only American on the pitch for Iran, he is not the only American on the Iranian team. Portugese-American Dan Gaspar from Connecticut has been Iran's goalkeeper coach for three years. Mr Gaspar told the AP: 'I believe they find me more interesting. In three-plus years working in Iran, I have never have had any issues as a result of my nationality, Portuguese-American. I have been impressed by the Iranian hospitality and kindness.' Some Americans were unhappy with Beitashour's decision to play for the Iranian team in this year's World Cup .

"By . Luke Salkeld . Bitter: Neale Hogg sent his ex-fiancee threatening letters asking her to reimburse him for hotel stays, clothes and others gifts he spent on her . As the Beatles told us, money can’t buy love. But when Neale Hogg’s relationship broke down, he believed he should be recompensed for the cost of his wooing. Hogg, 55, bombarded his former fiancée with invoices for the £3,250 he forked out while romancing her, on hotel stays, meals, clothes and an engagement ring. Every penny he spent during the 18-month relationship with nurse Martha Muzhange was totted up before he sent demands for the ‘debt’ to be paid in full. The civil servant even wanted a refund for the price of an MOT test, and became so desperate to get his money back from 54-year-old Miss Muzhange he sent letters to her fellow church-goers. Swansea magistrates’ court heard the pair became engaged after meeting on dating website and planned to marry later this year, but split up in January. Prosecutor Laura Carthew said: ‘Hogg repeatedly contacted her asking for his money back. ‘He posted letters through her letterbox demanding money from her and asking for backdated cheques. These items appear to have been delivered on an almost weekly basis.’ She added: ‘At one point he even went to Ms Muzhange’s church and started giving letters to her fellow parishioners. ‘She can no longer go to church because she’s afraid of repercussions.’ Hogg, of Fforestfach, Swansea, admitted harassment and was given a 12-month community order and told to have treatment for alcohol addiction. Magistrates also granted a restraining order preventing him from approaching or contacting mother-of-two Miss Muzhange, who arrived in Britain from Zimbabwe in 2002. Bombarded: Hogg met Martha Muzhange (pictured) through an online dating website and had planned to get married later this year before breaking up . Simon Howell, defending, said: ‘At the end of the relationship he felt very strongly that this was money owed to him. ‘But he has now decided to forget about what he considers a debt owed to him by this lady.’ Father-of-one Hogg, who has lost his job with the DVLA after 12 years, said he proposed after two months of dating. ‘We got on very well, we went on holidays and trips – all the sorts of things you do as a couple when you’re in love,’ he said. ‘Martha is from Zimbabwe and in their culture they have a different way of doing things. ‘You have to be accepted into the . family, then the head of the family will have a word with you and you . have to pay a dowry to kind of buy in. We got to Christmas and that was . all fine but then it started to go downhill and we had some major . disagreements. ‘We fell out big time and I was disowned by her relatives.’ In a statement read to the court, Miss . Muzhange said she had suffered medical problems since the incident and . was afraid for her safety and that of her son, daughter and her . grandchildren. The invoice blitz is the second time Hogg has appeared in . court before charged with offences against the woman he once planned to . marry. In February, he was fined £100 by magistrates after slapping her around the face with the back of his hand. He also admitted causing damage but . despite the court appearances Hogg still keeps framed pictures of Miss . Muzhange on his bookshelves at home.","Neale Hogg, 55, demanded Martha Muzhange, 54 pay back his £3,250 'debt'

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . Smart mannequins that ‘talk’ to shoppers through their smartphones will go live today in what is a world first. A trial involves branches of House of Fraser, Hawes & Curtis and the Bentalls department store. The models are fitted with beacons that send alerts to the smart phones of shoppers who are passing within 50 metres, providing access to information about what they are wearing. Smart mannequins that ‘talk’ to shoppers through their smartphones will go live today in branches of House of Fraser, Hawes & Curtis and the Bentalls department store . People who download the associated app, designed by a British company called Iconeme, can learn about the clothes and shoes, in terms of where to find them in the store and how much each item costs. The app can also connect to the retailer’s website, which means items spotted in the window can be bought online regardless of the time of day or whether the store is open. Customers can share details of what they are looking at with friends and family via their smartphones and the web to get advice on whether they ought to go ahead and buy them. The technology is being used with French Connection and Jaeger clothes in the window of the Bentalls store in Kingston upon Thames, as well as the House of Fraser ‘buy and collect’ store in Aberdeen and Hawes & Curtis in Jermyn Street, London. Testing: The technology is being used at the Hawes & Curtis store in Jermyn Street, London (pictured),  with French Connection and Jaeger clothes in the window of the Bentalls store in Kingston upon Thames, as well as the House of Fraser ‘buy and collect’ store in Aberdeen . The communication between the mannequin and shopper is effectively in the form of images and information on the screen or the smartphone, however in the future it could be a spoken conversation. Just as smartphones like the iPhone has the Siri voice control system for users, this same system could be used to ‘chat’ to the mannequin to ask questions about what she is wearing. The idea of having a virtual conversation with mannequins has echoes of Dr Who, where the theme of shop dummies that come to life has featured several times over the decades. It was first used in 1970 when the doctor, who was played by Jon Pertwee, came up against the Autons or Nestenes. The episode caused great controversy at the time with complaints it was too frightening for children. More recently the character Rose, played by Billie Piper, was famously pursued by mannequins when the series was revived in 2005 and featured Christopher Eccleston as the doctor. Coming to life: Rose, played by Billie Piper, was famously pursued by mannequins when the series was revived in 2005 and featured Christopher Eccleston as the doctor . The beacon is installed directly into each mannequin or, alternatively, a hi-tech billboard, and transmits information that has been programmed by the retailer via a secure web-portal. The retailer can choose what information is made available, but equally important is the fact they can access information about the shopper. This can include the age, gender and location of the customer, what outfit was viewed and whether a purchase was made online. Shoppers can set their own privacy settings on the app to decide how much information they want to share – if any – with the fashion brand or store. The Iconeme founders are Jonathan Berlin and Adrian Coe, who together have over 50 years’ experience in the retail industry, working with famous name fashion chains. The two also run Universal Display, which is a leading manufacturer of mannequins and works with a number of top high street retailers, including BHS, Monsoon, Harvey Nichols and Arcadia Group, which owns Topshop. Mr Berlin said: ‘This technology will change the way people shop on the high street, as it brings together both on and offline retail. ‘Research shows that customers already use their smartphones while shopping in store, but until now, the retail industry hasn’t realised the full potential of this. ‘The beacon creates a completely new dimension to the shopping experience, by combining the consumer desire to be connected on the go, with the bricks and mortar store.’ Edward Smith, the brand manager of Hawes & Curtis, said: ‘We chose Iconeme because we want to develop a greater engagement with our customers. ‘Our visual merchandising team help bring our product to life in the windows and now we can have a better understanding of how this impacts the man and woman in the street. ‘The VMBeacon also works 24 hours a day, so we can have instant feedback and instant sales as a result of our displays, even if the store is closed. It’s a complete game-changer for the retail industry and we’re delighted to be in it from the start.’ British families are the most enthusiastic in the world in terms of using the internet and technology for shopping. Figures published by the British Retail Consortium (BRC) today (tue) show internet sales were up by 14.9per cent in July compared to the same month last year. More than one fifth of all spending on clothing – 21.2per cent – is now via online stores. BRC director general, Helen Dickinson, said: ‘July has seen good online growth and, for non-food products, one in every six pounds is now spent online.’ David McCorquodale, retail expert at KPMG, said the information held by web stores on their customers and their past purchases has been particularly effective in targeting them with tailored offers. ‘Despite the glorious sunshine, retailers managed to capture shoppers’ attention online through the use of targeted and innovative digital campaigns, linking products to holiday plans, festivals and sporting events,’ he said.","Trial involves House of Fraser, Hawes & Curtis and Bentalls .

"By . Sam Adams . A top New York private school has agreed to settle a landmark lawsuit brought by former pupils who claim its former football coach sexually abused boys there over a 20-year period. Poly Prep Country Day School in Brooklyn was accused of covering . up abuse allegedly carried out by Phil Foglietta  in a case . that shockingly mirrors the Penn State scandal. The school's decision brings to an end a three year legal battle which has divided former students and staff. Accused: Former football coach Phil Foglietta (no deceased) is accused of abusing hundreds of boys at Poly Prep Country Day School in Brooklyn over a 20-year period . A sexual abuse lawsuit was filed in 2009 by ten former students and two day campers at Poly Prep. At a hearing earlier this year, a lawyer representing the 12 victims argued that the abuse could have been prevented had the school not buried the football coach’s abuse in a bid to protect its reputation and athletic program. Kevin Mulhearn claimed that the school’s cover-up prevented Foglietta’s victims from taking legal action against the school in time, before the statute of limitations expired. But in what could be a landmark decision for sexual abuse survivors, US District Court Judge Frederic Block ruled in August that portions of the lawsuit . could proceed because administrators may have lied when they said . they did not become aware of the abuse allegations until 1991, according to the New York Daily News. Cover up: The school has been accused of . hiding Foglietta's sexual abuse over many years . Scandal: The school, in Brooklyn, New York, is one of the most prestigious in the US . Mr Mulhearn, who is also a former . student, accused Poly Prep of withholding documents and providing . misleading testimony.  The cover-up reportedly began in 1966 when one . alleged victim named William Jackson told J. Folwell Scull, who was . headmaster at the time, that he had been abused by Foglietta. The . school reportedly conducted a bogus investigation and the former . student was threatened with expulsion if he continued to voice his . allegations. A few years later, . another football player named John Marino told officials that he had . seen Foglietta abusing boys on ten different occasions but he was . branded a troublemaker. The cover-up continued for another 25 years until David Hiltbrand, a Philadelphia-based journalist and former student, told of the abuse he had suffered at the hands of the coach and wrote about the scandal. He was contacted by Mr Mulhearn, who filed the civil suit which sought damages of $20 million for each of the plaintiffs, in 2009. Mr  Mulhearn is accused the school of fraud, a charge Poly Prep argued is irrelevant because the plaintiffs did not sue in time. Crime: Former Penn State University assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky (centre) was jailed for abusing young boys . During a hearing in June this year, US Magistrate Judge Cheryl Pollak ruled that there was evidence that Poly Prep tried to mislead the plaintiffs and the court. Poly Prep officials declined to reveal the details of the settlement in a statement issued on Wednesday, reports the Daily News. 'We hope that the settlement brings a measure of closure to those members of the Poly community who were abused by Philip Foglietta,' headmaster David Harman is quoted as saying in the statement. 'Poly Prep has established itself as a model for the prevention of abuse to those within our care and we will do everything in our power to insure that nothing like this ever happens again.' The plaintiffs claim the abuse had a huge impact on their later lives,  leading to issues such as substance abuse and depression. Jerry Sandusky, a former assistant football coach at Penn State University was jailed for between 30 and 60 years in October after being found guilty of sexually abusing children.","Poly Prep Country Day School was accused of covering .

"By . Helen Collis . The Indian woman who was gang-raped on a bus in New Delhi earlier this month has suffered 'significant' brain injury and is fighting for her life, doctors have said. The 23-year-old woman was flown to Singapore for treatment at Mount Elizabeth hospital on Thursday, 10 days after she was brutally attacked by six men on Dec. 16. Hospital chief executive Dr. Kelvin Loh said Friday she also has infection of the lungs and abdomen. He said she 'is currently struggling against the odds.' He says a multi-disciplinary team of specialists is working tirelessly to save her life. The rape has triggered widespread outrage and calls for ensuring the safety of women who are subject to sexual harassment ranging from groping to rape every day across India. It came as the Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh responded to days of violent protest at the attack by promising better action to protect the nation's women. He said: 'The issue of safety and security of women is of the highest concern to our government.' Scroll down for video . Brutal attack: The 23-year-old student was assaulted on a moving bus and has now died from her injuries . The young victim was transferred to a hospital in Singapore but unfortunately doctors reported she died 'peacefully' A hospital statement said she was admitted to the intensive care unit of the Mount Elizabeth hospital and she was in an 'extremely critical condition'. India's Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde said in a statement that the government, which is funding and overseeing the victim's treatment, had decided to send her abroad on the recommendation of her doctors. 'Despite the best efforts of our doctors, the victim continues to be critical and her fluctuating health remains a big cause of concern to all of us,' he said. Meanwhile, authorities in India are attempting to stem any further violence from demonstrations that erupted in reaction to the rape. Police have barricaded streets, blocked metro stations and increased their presence in the city centre of New Delhi. One police officer has been killed during the protests. A 47-year-old married father of three died after three days' treatment in hospital, according to news service Al Jazeera . Concern: Members of the top organ transplant medical team accompanied the gang rape victim to Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore . State of the art: transplant facilities at the Mount Elizabeth Medical Centre in Singapore, where the gang-rape victim underwent treatment, are said to be among the best in the world . He was found on the ground during the protests. Eight people have been arrested and charged in connection with his death. His relatives, speaking on Al Jazeera, blame 'the people' for his death. 'It . is the fault of the people. He was only doing his duty and following . police orders. But the public attacked him and killed him so the people . are responsible,' one relative said. Police . said an autopsy showed the officer had a heart attack that could have . been caused by injuries suffered during violence at the protest. An . Associated Press journalist at the scene said the officer was running . toward the protesters with a group of police when he collapsed on the . ground and began frothing at the mouth and shaking. The journalist said . two protesters rushed to the officer to try to help him. Outrage: Indian students protesting today in Kolkata against the treatment of women following the recent gang-rape of a young woman in a moving bus in New Delhi . Anger: Despite calls for calm, protestors and police have been involved in violent clashes which have continued more than a week-and-a-half . Silent protest: Sex workers, lesbian and gay protestors held a silent march today as people feel too little is being done by police and authorities to protect them . Vigil: Candles were lit in Delhi as silent protestors stood displaying placards, banners and posters . Peaceful: Protestors want the government to take action to improve safety for women in India . As news of the horrific assault reached the public in India, outraged and disgusted civilians took to the streets in protest. Across . the country there have been demonstrations, including candle-lit vigils . and street protests with placards, chants and road blocks. During the days of protests, reports reveal more than 100 people and about 70 officers have been hurt. Police . have used batons, teargas and water cannon to try and disperse the . demonstrators after the authorities attempted to limit the public . gatherings. The Government . has faced criticism for the use of force against protesters, the failure . to implement laws to protect women in India's 'rape capital' and for . how slow it has been to respond to the strength of feeling. New Delhi: Activists of the All-India Democratic Women's Association and YWCA students take part in a protest march from Rashtrapati Bhawan to India gate against the gangrape of a girl, in New Delhi . Clashes: Police have been criticised for using heavy handed tactics against demonstrators who are demanding better protection of women following the brutal bus gang rape . But it looks like there is no end in sight for the demonstrations, however, as another march took place today in the city. Those taking part were demanding a government crackdown on the daily harassment Indian women face, ranging from groping to severe violence. Protesters demanding safer public transportation for women and the resignation of Delhi's police commissioner tried to march to the major India Gate traffic circle in central Delhi before being stopped by police in riot gear manning barricades. Protesters carried signs reading, 'Immediately end rape culture in India' and 'Zero tolerance of violence against women'. Rape victims rarely press charges because of social stigma and fear they will be accused of inviting the attack. Many women say they structure their lives around protecting themselves and their daughters from attack. Some protesters have called for the death penalty or castration for rapists, who under current laws face a maximum punishment of life imprisonment. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh pledged today to take action to protect the nation's women. Singh's government set up two committees in response to the protests. One, looking into speeding up sexual assault trials, has already received 6,100 email suggestions. The second will examine what lapses might have contributed to the rape - which took place on a moving bus that passed through police checkpoints - and suggest measures to improve women's safety. 'Let me state categorically that the issue of safety and security of women is of the highest concern to our government,' Singh said at a development meeting. He urged officials in India's states to pay special attention to the problem. 'There can be no meaningful development without the active participation of half the population, and this participation simply cannot take place if their security and safety is not assured,' he said.

"By . Sam Adams . A cab driver who refused to pick up a . blind couple and their guide dogs has been fined in one of the first . cases of its kind in the UK. Martin Roberts and Clare Burman had booked a taxi to collect them from their home in Ipswich, Suffolk. But when driver Metin Akin heard they had dogs he turned down the job, saying he did not want the animals on his car's leather seats. Refused: Cab driver Metin Akin (left) has been fined after refusing to pick up blind couple Martin Roberts and Clare Burman (right) from their home in Ipswich . Mr Roberts, who has been blind since birth, called the Ipswich Cabs 289 company to ask where his taxi was after it failed to turn up 15 minutes after the time he had booked. The operator told him that a driver had refused to take the fare because he was worried about the couple's two labrador guide dogs damaging the black leather seats in his silver VW Passat. Mr Roberts, 35, and 32-year-old Miss Burman, who has been registered blind since the age of 13, then had to wait a further 20 minutes for another taxi driver to pick them up and take them home, on July 8 last year. The . couple reached their destination with dogs Malone and Vikki but then . complained to Ipswich Borough Council who brought charges against Akin . under the 2010 Equality Act. Akin later claimed that the real reason was that he was allergic to dogs and was scared of them as he had been attacked by dogs when he was a child in Antalya, Turkey. The driver, who has been in the UK for four years, also claimed that he did not think his car was big enough for the two dogs. He was prosecuted by the council and . admitted a charge of breaking his licence conditions by refusing to pick . up a disabled person and his assistance dog. Akin, 32, was fined £165 and ordered to pay £1,233.50 costs after he admitted refusing to transport the couple. Complaint: Akin refused to give the couple a lift because he did not want their dogs, Vikki (right) and Malone on his car's leather seats . The . case before South East Suffolk magistrates on Thursday is one of a . handful of similar ones heard in the UK since the introduction of the . act. Mr Roberts who works in computer sales said had been left 'embarrassed and humiliated' by Akin's refusal to take the dogs. He and Miss Burman, a computer skills teacher for Ipswich Blind Society, were at her father's house when they booked cab to drive them three miles home. Mr Roberts said the taxi company were aware that he was with his three-year-old dog Vikki and Miss Burman had her eight-year-old dog Malone. He said after the case: 'I had used the taxi company lots of times in the past without any problem. The act requires equal treatment for everyone in access to employment as well as to private and public services - such as taxi cabs. This must be given regardless of the 'protected characteristics' of age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, race, religion or belief, sex, and sexual orientation of the people concerned. In the case of disability, employers and service providers are under a duty to make reasonable adjustments to their workplaces to overcome barriers experienced by disabled people. Certain forms of employment have been given exemptions under the Act, including priests and actors. 'When the cab failed to turn up about 15 minutes after it was expected, I called back to ask what had happened. 'The operator told me that they were sending another car because the nearest driver was refusing to pick us up as he had leather seats and was concerned about our dogs. 'Apparently the operator told him that it was the law that he had to pick us up, but he still refused. 'It was a ridiculous reason because guide dogs are trained not to climb on furniture or sit on seats. 'are always well behaved and sit in the footwells of cars or go in the boot of hatchbacks if the parcel shelf is out. 'Clare usually sits at the front of cabs with the seat pushed back and Malone at her feet and Vikki goes in the back in the rear footwell next to me. 'All taxi drivers are required to carry guide dogs unless they have a certificate giving them exemption for medical reasons. 'We felt embarrassed and humiliated. Imagine if you were denied a cab ride because of the sex or the colour of your skin? It is discrimination. 'I decided to make a stand by complaining to the council and they were very sympathetic. I am glad that they pursued the case in court. 'I want this to send a message out to other taxi drivers that they have to abide by the law. I want to speak out because there might be other blind people who don't feel confident enough to do so.' Mr Roberts said the cab company was not to blame for the driver's behaviour. He added: 'I want to make it clear that they have always been excellent and have assisted us in every way possible. We are still using them regularly. 'We are also glad that the driver is still working there. I don't think it is right that he should lose his job over it.' Ipswich council solicitor Christopher Bing told magistrates that Atkin was the closest driver in the area and had initially accepted the fare. But then he turned down the fare when he realised he would have to transport the dogs, telling his controller that he was worried about his seats, said Mr Bing. The court heard how Akin applied for an exemption certificate last August to give him the right to refuse to carry guide dogs on the grounds that he was allergic to dogs. But his application was refused after he had pin-prick tests which showed he was not allergic to them. Akin claimed yesterday that he had not refused to pick up the dogs because of his leather seats. He said: 'I think I am allergic to dogs. They make my throat sore and I don't like them. 'I have taken one dog at a time in my cab without any problem. It was because there were two dogs. I didn't think it was safe and I thought a bigger car was needed. 'Also I was frightened because I was attacked by two dogs when I was young. Psychologically, I didn't want to pick them up.' Sandy Martin, the Fairer Ipswich portfolio holder for Ipswich Borough Council, said: 'We will not tolerate any discriminatory behaviour by taxi drivers whether it is on the grounds of disability, sex, religion or ethnic origin.'","Metin Akin, 32, refused to pick up Martin Roberts, 35, and Clare Burman, 32 .

"By . Rob Cooper . Accused: Nile Ranger claims that his alleged victim consented to sex in his hotel room . The woman who accused footballer Nile Ranger of raping her went willingly to his hotel room on the night she 'attacked', a jury has heard. The alleged victim then posted pictures of herself online dancing on a beach a month after the attack, Newcastle Crown Court was told. Former Newcastle United striker Ranger, 22, who now plays for League One side Swindon Town, denies rape and says the woman consented to sex. In CCTV footage shown to the court, the jury saw the victim was unsteady on her feet in a nightclub before following Ranger out and into a taxi on the night of the attack. She was then seen crouching down, picking up the contents of her bag, outside the hotel before following him down a hotel corridor and into the hotel room. Toby Hedworth, defending, told the victim: 'It is apparent that you followed him up the corridor. 'You were not being dragged or helped along the corridor. You were not being forcibly taken anywhere. 'He says you were enthusiastically participating in the sex that took place.' The victim told the jury she returned to the hotel after the alleged attack with a friend to check who was on the desk the previous night. During evidence via videolink she told the court how her friend spotted Ranger standing at the desk. She said: 'Nile Ranger was at that desk and he was booking another room that night for the same thing to happen to somebody else. 'I wasn't going to let it happen to someone else. 'My brother noticed the state I was in. When I came in the house I was even missing a nail. I was in such a state I went straight into the bedroom, I couldn't even speak to him. 'I tried to convince myself it was a one night stand just to make myself feel better but I knew it wasn't a one night stand. 'It is not in my behaviour or my character. I knew what had happened but I tried to put it to the back of my head. I was so confused. All I wanted to do is dust it under the carpet. Trial: Nile Ranger, seen here (right) in action for Newcastle against Fulham, denies rape . Slip down the leagues: Former Toon striker Ranger is now on Swindon Town's books . 'I didn't want my name tarnished in the press. My friend came to my house and told me there were precautions where my name wouldn't be released to the press. That's what made me go to the police.' Toby Hedworth, defending, told the court the victim went on holiday just a month after the attack is alleged to have taken place at the Carlton Hotel in Jesmond, Newcastle, in January last year. He said: 'This is not someone who has been devastated by what's happened. 'This is someone who didn't want a relationship with Nile Ranger and got on with your life.' He told the jury she posted photos of herself and a friend dancing on a beach while on holiday the following month. In response the victim told the court how she went on holiday to try and forget about what had happened. Gary . Langham, who was a night porter at the Carlton Hotel at the time of the . attack, later described Ranger as 'cocky' and 'a typical arrogant . footballer full of drink with a bird on his arm'. Goal: Ranger scores against Peterborough in the Johnstone's Paint Trophy earlier this month . Mr Langham told the court that he was on duty on the night of the alleged rape and that Ranger appeared 'loud and boisterous' whereas the girl appeared 'mortal drunk'. When asked if he had concerns for the victim he said: 'She was mortal she was beyond p***ed. I said, ""Is everything alright?"" to Nile. 'I didn't decide to do anything but when I went outside to get some fresh air I  saw a police car going past. I flagged it down and told them Nile was inside with a lass and asked them if they could kick them out and check if everything was alright. 'I have heard he gets lairy and I couldn't be bothered with him kicking off.' The court heard how Mr Langham told the police that the victim wasn't distressed and that she appeared coherent but drunk and that she had gone with Ranger willingly. When asked what he meant by 'lairy' Mr Langham said: 'Nile is a typical arrogant footballer; that is what they are like. A gob***** coming in full of drink with a bird on his arm.' A friend of the victim told the court how she received a text the morning after  the alleged attack from the victim. In the text the victim told her that 'something bad had happened' and 'I have had sex with Nile.' Her friend told the court how she went to visited the victim that morning and  found her hiding in the corner of her bedroom. Her friend told the court: 'I could tell by her texts there was something  wrong. She is usually very bubbly but she was emotionless even through message. 'When I went to see her she said she had slept with Nile and it wasn't like her  at all. She said I can't remember what happened and she was bursting into  tears. She was shaking and crying her eyes out. 'The more she was trying to remember the more upset and distressed she was getting.' Ranger denies a single charge of rape.

"By . Jamie Redknapp . COULD FREE TERRY BE A CITY SLICKER? Hard as it is to believe, when John Terry walks out at Anfield on Sunday, he may only have three more league games remaining in a Chelsea shirt. Terry, 33, can leave on a free transfer at the end of the season and Chelsea have only offered him a one-year deal, in line with club policy for senior players. Perhaps they take him for granted and expect him to stay, regardless of the reduction in terms. He has enjoyed one of the best seasons of his career, so these tactics by Chelsea are a dangerous game of risk. VIDEO Scroll down for Holland: Chelsea want John Terry to stay and he wants to stay . Free agent: John Terry is yet to sign a new contract at Chelsea for next season . Battle: Terry challenges Sunderland striker Jozy Altidore at Stamford Bridge . I wonder if Manchester City would consider a daring raid. If they could pull it off, they get to weaken one of their rivals and they end up with Terry and Vincent Kompany in a mighty partnership. It would take a minimum two-year contract to drag Terry from Stamford Bridge, where you can imagine he would ideally like to finish his career as a one-club player. I can’t see him leaving, but I can see City — who have tried to sign him before — enjoying the mischief. Terry in another club’s shirt seems  unimaginable...or does it? JOSE'S PROTEST LINE-UP . On the matter of Chelsea, I wonder what team Jose Mourinho will take to Anfield on Sunday? He wanted the game to be played on a Saturday, but the Premier League  said no. The game is sandwiched between the two legs of the Champions League semi-final and with Chelsea five points adrift after losing to Sunderland, maybe he will prioritise Europe. That will hardly bring cheer to Manchester City. Unhappy: Jose Mourinho wanted Chelsea's game at Liverpool to be played on a Saturday . WONDER OF WICKHAM . Connor Wickham has to be the player of the week, with three goals in matches against Barclays Premier League heavyweights. Blow: Connor Wickham scores at Stamford Bridge to damage their Premier League title hopes . Connor Wickham is the only opposition player to have scored at both the Etihad Stadium and Stamford Bridge this season. Before then, he had scored only once in 37 PL games, but I’ve always liked the look of him since he came through at Ipswich. A spell at Leeds on loan this season brought a return of no goals in five games but Gus Poyet has gambled with him and those goals this week have given Sunderland hope. Can Wickham continue at home against Cardiff next Sunday? CENTRAL STERLING . We began the early part of the season raving about Andros Townsend but Raheem Sterling is the bright, explosive young talent now. He’s learning still, but he is robust, powerful and direct and rather than debate whether he should be on the plane for Brazil, I say he should be in the England team. Magic: Raheem Sterling scored two goals for Liverpool in their victory at Norwich . Rising star: Sterling has been a revelation under Brendan Rodgers and should be on the plane to Brazil . On target: Sterling has scored nine goals for Liverpool in their push for the Premier League title . Where Brendan Rodgers has done brilliantly is by moving him in from the wing and playing him at the point of a diamond. Can Roy Hodgson find a similar place for him? Will he be bold enough to give Sterling such licence? It seems a waste to have him chasing attacking full backs out on the flanks. WELCOME BACK, AARON . What a week it was for Gareth Bale, but he’s not the only Welshman catching the eye. It’s great to see Aaron Ramsey back for Arsenal. He’s the only midfielder they have who will run forward without the ball and his absence through injury has seen them tumble down the league and out of Europe. Arsenal might still be in the title race had he been fit. That’s how important he has become. He ran 7.9 miles against Hull, more than anyone else on the pitch. High flying: Aaron Ramsey returned to scoring ways for Arsenal after his injury in their win at Hull . UNITED LEARN A HARSH LESSON . When I joined Liverpool in 1991, I’d have laughed if you’d said they would go so long without winning the title. But they are the perfect example of how things can go very wrong very quickly. Manchester United are now finding that out. Last season they won the league by 11 points, now they are 23 points behind the leaders. The players look unhappy with David Moyes — they are not performing for him. It is a real worry and he needs to get them motivated fast. Cruise: Everton beat Manchester United 2-0 at Goodison Park to boost their top four hopes . Welcome back: David Moyes endured a miserable return to Goodison Park, where he managed for 11 years . Moyes is . clearly a good manager but the move is not  working out for him and only . the club hierarchy know whether he will be given time to turn things . round. Manchester . United have the reputation of being a club who don’t sack their . managers. That is because they had someone in Sir Alex Ferguson who was . winning trophies. Now . that philosophy will be tested more than ever. Liverpool chopped and . changed managers so many times and it got them nowhere. Now that is . United’s quandary: keep the faith and let Moyes overhaul his declining . squad, or give up. YOU'RE NOT A-LOAN, MARTIN . Martin Samuel, my Sportsmail colleague, is firm in his views on loans. I share some of his concerns, because I too believe the system is open to abuse. Chelsea’s No 2 goalkeeper playing against them in the Champions League is farcical, as was Liverpool’s Fabio Borini scoring Sunderland’s winner against Chelsea on Saturday. However, I don’t believe they should be outlawed altogether. Favour: Liverpool loanee Fabio Borini scored the winner for Sunderland at Chelsea . My rule would be that Under 21 players only can be loaned as it performs a key part of their development. Jack Wilshere, Daniel Sturridge, Andros Townsend, Rio Ferdinand and Frank Lampard are all examples of that. 43 - Aaron Lennon now has 43 Premier League assists for Spurs, just one behind Teddy Sheringham, who had 44, but still has some way to go to match the record of 67 by Darren Anderton. 11 - Liverpool have only once before won 11 league games in a row in a single season. The last time was between March and May in the 1981-82 season, when they won the title. 3 - Harry Kane became the first Spurs player since Gareth Bale in May 2013 to score in three consecutive Premier League games for the club. PL top scorers . 1 - Southampton midfielder Adam Lallana has provided just one assist in his last 16 Premier League appearances. He has nine goals for the season. 1962 - Cardiff have not managed . back-to-back top-flight wins since April 1962, when they beat Birmingham . 3-2 and West Ham 3-0. Saturday’s draw with Stoke means Cardiff are . without a win in eight against them in all competitions. 45 - Andy Carroll has averaged a header at goal every 45 minutes in the . league this season, a more prolific rate than any other player. 12 - Samuel Eto’o has scored 12 goals for Chelsea, and all of them have come at Stamford Bridge. 7 - Stoke have conceded seven penalties this season — a joint league-high with West Brom.","John Terry will be out of contract at Chelsea in the summer .

The ring leaders of the Bali Nine drug smuggling plot could escape the firing squad after the governor of the prison where they have been locked up since 2005 recommended their sentences be reduced to life behind bars. Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran were sentenced to death for their roles in the the failed attempt to smuggle 8.3kg of heroin out of Bali to Australia and appealed to the Indonesian president  about two years ago for clemency. In a boost in the hopes of getting off death row, Kerobokan prison governor Farid Junaedi said the pair should have their sentences reduced to a fixed term,  reported the Sydney Morning Herald. Bali Nine ring leaders Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran are on death row . The two Australians appealed to the Indonesian president about two years ago for clemency . Mr Junaedi revealed on Sunday, during a ceremony commemorating Indonesia's independence day in Bali, that he had made 'several recommendations' for sentence reductions for good behaviour. 'These include the Bali Nine - from death sentence to life, and from life to a fixed term [usually 20 years],' Mr Farid said. This is the first time the Bali prison governor has made such a recommendation, which was submitted to the central government in Jakarta earlier this year. 'It's just something simple. I just don't want to be shot, really,' Sukumaran said on Saturday. But it is believed outgoing president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, whose term ends in October, is hesitant to grant Chan and Sukumaran's wishes as it would come across as favouring Australian and other foreign drug traffickers. Since being jailed the pair have worked hard to convince their jailers they are reformed characters - Chan has worked with the prison church and Sukumaran runs an art class to give hope to other inmates. The Bali Nine were caught trafficking 8.3 kilograms of heroin out of the Indonesian island in April 2005. The other Australians serving life sentences in Kerobokan prison are Scott Rush, Martin Stephens, Matthew Norman, Si Yi Chen, Tan Duc Than Nguyen and Michael Czugaj.","Bali Nine ring leaders Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran are on death row .

"By . Kate Lyons . and Sally Lee For Daily Mail Australia . Clive Palmer launched a bizarre attack on Chinese people while appearing on Q&A on Monday night, calling them 'bastards' and 'mongrels' who 'shoot their own people'. The Palmer United Party leader was on the panel of the ABC's flagship programme when he hit out with a racist attack on Chinese business interests in Australia, accusing Chinese people of trying to take over Australia . 'The Chinese government wants to bring workers here to destroy our wage system ... they want to take over our ports and get our resources for free. So far they've shifted $200 million worth of iron ore out of this country without paying for it. I don't mind standing up against the Chinese bastards and stop them from doing it,' he said. Scroll down for video . Australia's Palmer United Party leader was on the panel of ABC television program Q&A on Monday night when he hit out with the racist comments . Clive Palmer (right) on the panel with opposition leader in the senate Penny Wong (middle) and talk show host Tony Jones (left) The controversial MP made the comments when he was being questioned by host Tony Jones about allegations he used money from one of his business accounts to fund his election campaign. Mr Palmer repeatedly refused to answer Mr Jones's questions, saying he would be answering them in court this week and would not be subjected to a trial by media. He then claimed he was owed 'about $500 million by the Communist Chinese government.' 'We'll be suing them and they'll be answering the questions. We've had... an arbitration against these Chinese mongrels - I'm saying that because they're Communist, they shoot their own people, they haven't got a justice system and they want to take over this country. And we're not going to let them,' he said. Today, Mr Palmer took to Twitter to explain his remarks, saying: 'My #qanda comments not intended to refer to Chinese people but to Chinese company which is taking Australian resources & not paying'. Treasurer Joe Hockey condemned Mr Palmer's comments saying they were 'hugely damaging' and that Mr Palmer was himself the beneficiary of Chinese investment. 'I would say to Clive Palmer please do not bring down the rest of Australia because of your bias,' he told the ABC. Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce remarked this morning that Palmer's remarks were 'not helpful' and could be harmful to Australia's business relationship with China. 'Clive started with a company called China First. He wanted to make a lot of money out of dealing with China. You can't blame the Chinese for being tough business people. That's what business is about. But the emotive and colourful language is not the way that you do business,' Mr Joyce said on ABC News Breakfast. An Australian activist group weren't impressed by Mr Palmer's racist rant . Viewers of the program took to social media to express their disgust on Monday night . Sheena Young responded to Mr Palmer's comments on Twitter . Even former One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, who said in her maiden address to Parliament in 1996 that Australia was in danger of being 'swamped by Asians', condemned his comments, saying he should 'stick [his] nose out of other people's business'. 'Maybe Clive Palmer should take a position over in China in Parliamentary seats. I’ve always said clean up your own backyard before criticising other people. It’s not up to Clive Palmer or anyone else. It’s not for us or Australia to get involved in that,' she told Sunrise. Outraged Q&A viewers took to social media and expressed their disgusts over the mining billionaire's derogatory views. Activist group GetUp! tweeted: 'Hey, that was pretty racist @CliveFPalmer, and that's not okay'. 'To say what Clive Palmer just said on #qanda. I'm surprised if that's legal. Or free speech absolute in Oz?' Peter Johansson tweeted. 'I love how @clivefpalmer is celebrating Australia's cultural diversity in an anger racist Palmer kind of way,' Raphael tweeted. Silas Palmer wrote: 'Was that [the snarling, racist and ruthless] the Real Clive Palmer'. 'Dear @JulieBishopMP , If you need help with your portfolio perhaps @CliveFPalmer may help with a diplomatic mission to China,' tweeted Viscount Mike OBE. The 56-year-old is a mining billionaire and established the Palmer United Party last year . The 56-year-old was on the panel for the weekly Australian talk show hosted by Tony Jones. Other panellists were deputy prime minister Warren Truss, opposition leader in the senate Penny Wong, businesswoman and RBA board member Heather Ridout, national CEO of St Vincent de Paul Society John Falzon. In 2009, Clive Palmer criticised the Labor government's trade policies, which made trade more difficult for Chinese investors than U.S. investors. In an address to the Queensland Media Club he called the current policies 'racist' and said there was 'a great cry in Australia about Reds under the bed'. But Mr Palmer argued that 'capital is now in China, it's not in the US' and that Australia had a terrific opportunity to become a strong trade partner with China 'if our politicians could only be fair and treat the Chinese people and Chinese government with the dignity they deserve.'","The leader of Palmer United Party was on live television when he said the racist comment on Monday night .

"By . Vicente L. Panetta, Ap Reporter . Gerardo Martino has been hired as coach of Argentina, less than three months after leaving Barcelona. The Argentine Football Association said the 51-year-old Martino will replace Alejandro Sabella, who stepped down after Argentina's loss to Germany in last month's World Cup final. Martino will be officially unveiled on Thursday. It will be his second coaching role with a national team, having been in charge of Paraguay from 2006-11. Back home: Gerardo Martino (left) has been named as boss of the Argentina national team . Friends reunited? Superstar striker Lionel Messi endured a disappointing last season under Martino with Barcelona (left) and lost in the World Cup final against Germany under Alejandro Sabella (right, with Messi) Martino was hired until the end of qualifying for the 2018 World Cup, but the contract will be automatically extended if the team makes it to the tournament in Russia. Martino left Barcelona in May with one year left on his contract after the club failed to win a major trophy for the first time in six years. Known for offensive squads, Martino had been favored for the job by AFA president Julio Grondona, who passed away on July 30. One of the reasons Martino was seen as a good fit for the role is because he has good relations with Lionel Messi and midfielder Javier Mascherano, the Barcelona players who are the leaders of the Argentine national team. Glory: Mario Gotze (second right) celebrates scoring the winning goal in the 2014 World Cup final for Germany . His first official task will be to pick the squad for a September 3 friendly against Germany in Dusseldorf, a match that was scheduled before the nations made it to the World Cup final in Brazil. The squad announcement is expected next week. Martino began his career almost 16 years ago with small club Brown de Arrecifes in Argentina. After coaching other local clubs, he moved to Paraguay to manage popular clubs Libertad and Cerro Porteno. He returned to Argentina in 2005 to coach Colon, then had another stint with Libertad before taking over Paraguay's national team in late 2006. He led the South American nation to the quarterfinals of the 2010 World Cup and to the final of the 2011 Copa America, won by Uruguay. He revamped Newell's Old Boys after arriving in 2012, leading the Argentine club to a national title and the semifinals of the Copa Libertadores in 2013. His success with Newell's helped him land the Barcelona job, but he wasn't able to live up to expectations in Spain. Argentina, coming off the 1-0 loss to Germany in the World Cup final at the Maracana Stadium, haven't won a major title since the 1993 Copa America in Ecuador. The team won gold in the 2004 and 2008 Olympics, tournaments played mostly with Under 23 players.","Argentina appoint Gerardo Martino as coach to replace Alejandro Sabella .

RR Auction, in Amherst, New Hampshire, US, on Friday and sold for . $130,000 - just over £80,000. The Apollo Prayer League was founded . by Reverend John Stout for the purpose of praying for space missions . after the ill-fated Apollo 1 mission that saw three astronauts - Ed . White, Gus Grissom, and Roger Chaffee - die in a fire during a launch . pad test in 1967. New technology: Microfilm meant that all 1245 pages and more than 773,000 words of the Bible could be reduced down to fit on a small piece of film . Valuable: The collection went under the hammer at RR Auction, in Amherst, New Hampshire, US, on Friday and sold for $130,000 - just over £80,000 . Before his death White had told a reporter that he hoped one day to carry a Bible to the moon, so in the aftermath of the tragedy the Apollo Prayer Group adopted the challenge on his behalf. Due to restrictions on personal items that could be carried by the Apollo astronauts, the Bible posed a significant weight problem that needed to be solved. In order to make it small enough and light enough to be taken on board, the Prayer League brought in new microfilm technology to shrink it down. This meant that all 1,245 pages and more than 773,000 words of the Bible could be reduced down to fit on a small piece of film the size of a colour slide. Support: Soon after the Apollo 1 mission tragedy the Apollo Prayer League swelled to over 40,000 NASA employees . Success: Apollo 14 launched in January 1971 taking with it 300 copies of the Bible in microfilm . Soon after membership in the league swelled to over 40,000 NASA employees, and efforts were begun on the Lunar Bible Project. Reverand Stout eventually gained permission for a single microfilm copy of the King James bible to be taken on board Apollo 12. But his efforts to get the Bible to the moon were thwarted when the document was stored in the command module rather than the lunar module - meaning it did not descend to the lunar surface. The Prayer League then purchased a number of the microfilm Bibles and 512 were packaged up to be sent with the Apollo 13 mission in an effort once again to deliver them to the moon. But the ill-fated mission suffered an on-board explosion in space, and it too circled the moon and returned to Earth without landing. Despite the failed efforts of getting the Bibles to the moon on the Apollo 12 and 13 missions, the league's dreams were finally realised when Apollo 14 brought 300 of them to the moon on February 5, 1971. Determined Reverend Stout had split the Bibles this time, placing 100 in the lunar module and 200 in the command module to improve their chances of success.","The complete set of microfilm lunar Bibles were carried on board the Apollo 12, 13, and 14 missions .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Scientists have created cells capable of killing cancer for the first time. The dramatic breakthrough was made by researchers in Japan who created cancer-specific killer T cells. They say the development paves the way for the cells being directly injected into cancer patients for therapy. Scientists have created cells capable of killing cancer for the first time. Pictured: microscopic cells being cultured to kill cancer . The cells naturally occur in small numbers, but it is hoped injecting huge quantities back into a patient could turbo-charge the immune system. Researchers at the RIKEN Research Centre for Allergy and Immunology revealed they have succeeded for the first time in creating cancer-specific, immune system cells called killer T lymphocytes. To create these, the team first had to reprogramme T lymphocytes specialised in killing a certain type of cancer, into another type of cell called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells). These iPS cells then generated fully active, cancer-specific T lymphocytes. These lymphocytes regenerated from iPS cells could potentially serve as cancer therapy in the future. Previous research has shown that killer T lymphocytes produced in the lab using conventional methods are inefficient in killing cancer cells mainly because they have a very short life-span, which limits their use as treatment for cancer. To overcome the problems, the Japanese researchers, led by Hiroshi Kawamoto reprogrammed mature human killer T lymphocytes into iPS cells and investigated how these cells differentiate. The team induced killer T lymphocytes . specific for a certain type of skin cancer to reprogramme into iPS cells . by exposing the lymphocytes to the 'Yamanaka factors' - a group of . compounds that induce cells to revert back to a non-specialised, stage. Japanese researchers who created cancer-specific killer T cells (pictured) say the development paves the way for the cells being directly injected into cancer patients for therapy . The iPS cells obtained were then grown in the lab and induced to differentiate into killer T lymphocytes again. This new batch of T lymphocytes was shown to be specific for the same type of skin cancer as the original lymphocytes. They maintained the genetic reorganisation, enabling them to express the cancer-specific receptor on their surface. The new T lymphocytes were also shown to be active and to produce an anti-tumour compound. Doctor Kawamoto said: 'We have succeeded in the expansion of antigen-specific T cells by making iPS cells and differentiating them back into functional T cells. 'The next step will be to test whether these T cells can selectively kill tumour cells but not other cells in the body. If they do, these cells might be directly injected into patients for therapy. This could be realised in the not-so-distant future.' The findings were published in the journal Cell Stem Cell. Dr Dusko Ilic, Senior Lecturer in Stem Cell Science, King’s College London, said: 'The study tackled a novel, quite interesting approach to cell based therapy, something that we do not usually hear about. 'Although this approach requires further verification and a lot of work needs to be done before we can think about clinical trials, the initial data are promising. 'This pioneering work definitely provides a strong foundation to build and expand our knowledge about new opportunities in cell based therapy and personalised medicine.'","The cells naturally occur in the body in small .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Canadian family are reeling after a stranger sent them a letter telling them to euthanize their severely autistic son. During the summer, 13-year-old Max Begley spends his mornings with his grandmother Brenda Millson in Newcastle. She says she was shaking after receiving a letter Friday from an anonymous neighbor complaining that the noise Max makes outside is 'DREADFUL!'  and that it 'scares the hell out of my normal children!' Mrs Millson shared the whole letter with CityNewsToronto. Nothing good to say: An anonymous neighborhood mother wrote this letter to the grandmother of a severely autistic teen in Newcastle, Canada . Sadness and anger: Max's mother Karla Begley was in tears as she read the hateful letter directed at her son . Signed off 'one pissed off mother' the woman goes on to say that the noises Max makes are not appropriate for the neighborhood. 'Crying babies, music and even barking dogs are normal sounds in a residential neighborhood! He is not!' The woman's deranged letter goes beyond the offensive noise complaint into even more repugnant territory, writing that Max is a 'hindrance'. 'Who the hell is going to care for him? No employer will ever hire him, no normal girl is going to marry/love him and you are not going to live forever!' Then she recommends something truly atrocious. 'Personally, they should take whatever non retarded body parts he possesses and donate it to science. What the hell else good is he to anyone!' 'Do the right thing and move or euthanize him! Either way, we are ALL better off.' 'Who says that about a child?' Max's mother Karla Begley asked City News. She started to cry as she explained that her secondary progressive multiple sclerosis keeps her from walking and running with her son. 13-year-old Max was diagnosed with severe autism when he was two and he spends his summer mornings at his grandmother's house, usually playing in the backyard . On his side: The neighborhood came out in support of Max after hearing about the abhorrent letter . Since learning about the letter, neighbors of Max's grandmother have come out in a public display of support for the boy in an attempt to out the letter's author. Max's father is worried that the letter might lead to violence against his son. 'A person that's that crazy or demented who would fabricate something like that...it leads me to believe that they're very dangerous,' Jim Begley said, 'and right now I'm scared for my son's safety.

"By . Sally Lee For Daily Mail Australia . A new study has cracked the code on how children develop an understanding for language and vocabulary. The research by the University of Western Sydney discovered that children aged three to six start to use the same strategies as adults when identifying new facts and objects. This follows previous studies which uncovered baby talk to infants was a pivotal part of their learning, where adults naturally start to use a more sophisticated form of speech once the child reaches their first birthday. A new university study has found that adults should be clearer in messages to pre-schoolers . The recent study found that children aged three to six, like adults, were able to use a process of elimination to arrive at an answer. But their understanding of how new words and expressions are linked to objects can be different from adults. Co-researcher Karen Mattock says when children hit this age group, adults should be using 'child directed speech'. 'This means we should be clearer and give short, simple and repeated instructions to better convey the message,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'When you are teaching your child the names of items or giving information about them, keep in mind that their knowledge about language is different, so make sure they are attending to you as well as to the item you are talking about and encourage your child to ask questions. 'These quality interactions go a long way to helping your child’s vocabulary and knowledge grow.' The research was done by Karen Mattock (right) and Marina Kalashnikova, from the University of Western Sydney . That's not to say that baby talk should be eliminated. 'At a young age this is very important for an infant's learning,' Ms Mattock said. 'The melody of baby talk maintains the infant's interest and allows them to capture emotions which facilitates bonding. 'Also the sing song nature of it and the exaggerated, hyper articulation of stretching out vowels also helps with their development.' The research is part of a wider three year study into children and language. 'Young children are amazing at the way they quickly gain language skills,' Ms Mattock said. 'What we wanted to do is find out more about the way children learn words so we can give parents the best strategies to teach new words to their children.'","A study by the University of Western Sydney found that adults should be clearer in messages to pre-schoolers .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . and Jonathan McEvoy . 'Long-term concerns': MPs are calling for Russia to be stripped of the 2018 World Cup to increase pressure on Vladimir Putin after the shooting down of MH17 by pro-Moscow rebels . Vladimir Putin today faced growing calls for Russia to be banned from hosting the World Cup and Formula One races after the shooting down of MH17. British MPs urged the move to heap pressure on Moscow over its support for pro-Russian separatists who are blamed for killing all 298 people on board the Malaysia Airlines jet. Tracey Crouch, a member of the culture, media and sport select committee, said Russia should be 'stripped now' of the 2018 football tournament in light of the disaster. The MP, who is also a qualified football coach, told The Times: 'Football could be . used to put pressure on President Putin to change some of his . practices. 'Russia was seemingly a democratic country when they won the . bid. 'I've had long-term concerns about Russia's human rights and views on homosexuality.' The Russian bid has already been mired in controversy after it was linked to a corrupt official from the game's world governing body, Fifa. Two . journalists from The Sunday Times - Jonathan Calvert and Heidi Blake - . claimed that disgraced Fifa vice-president Mohamed bin Hammam held a secret meeting with Mr Putin . shortly before the successful vote. The revelations came after the paper accused Bin Hammam of buying support for Qatar's successful bid for the 2022 tournament by making payments to football officials involved in the vote. Ms Blake said there 'may have been some collusion between the two bids.' Meanwhile, there was increasing pressure to cancel this year's inaugural Grand Prix in Sochi after the MH17 tragedy. However, Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone has said the race will go ahead despite gathering opposition. Ecclestone . is a personal friend of Vladimir Putin and said he will ‘100 per cent’ honour his contract to stage a race in Sochi on October 12 in the face . of disquiet among teams, sponsors and politicians. The situation within the sport is particularly delicate because Malaysian energy company Petronas, title sponsors of Lewis Hamilton’s Mercedes team, have established a £1.8million fund for the families of the 298 victims of the disaster. Scroll down to video . Not backing down: Bernie Ecclestone, pictured alongside Vladimir Putin, has refused to cancel this year's Russian Grand Prix despite growing opposition to the race . Senior . team figures privately told Sportsmail that they are uneasy about going . to a race linked so closely with Putin, who is suspected of supplying . pro-Russian militants with the surface-to-air missiles that shot down . the plane. Conservative . MP David Davis, a former foreign minister, said: ‘Whilst I’m not . particularly in favour of cancelling sports events at the drop of a hat, . here you’ve had the murder of 298 citizens. 'It can’t conceivably be defended as a reasonable act of war, and therefore I think that Formula One should reflect that.’ Menzies Campbell, the Lib Dems’ former foreign affairs spokesman, said: ‘There will have to be an assessment of the suitability of this race nearer the time to decide whether it should be held. 'Public opinion all over the world will find it difficult to accept Mr Putin taking all the plaudits for this grand prix in Russia.’ Sombre ceremony: Bodies from the MH17 disaster are carried onto a Dutch C130 aircraft at Kharkiv Aiport in Ukraine before being flown to the Netherlands for identification . Children walk past a piece of wreckage from the MH17.

Tracey Crouch (left), an MP and qualified football coach wants Russia to be stripped of the World Cup, while former foreign minister David Davies (right) wants the same action taken with this year's Grand Prix in Sochi . Ecclestone, however, is insistent that the race should go ahead, having signed up the Russians on a five-year deal worth an estimated £120million. Putin personally invited Ecclestone, a friend since the idea of a race in St Petersburg was mooted a decade ago, to the opening ceremony of the Sochi Winter Olympics in February. Ecclestone said: ‘I don’t see any problem with going. We are not involved in politics. We have a contract with them. We’ll respect it 100 per cent and so will Mr Putin, I’m sure. He’s been very supportive.’ The FIA, the sport’s governing body, are keen not to get dragged into the dispute, citing their charter to be non-political. A spokesman said that while they were ‘awake to the situation’ they did not ‘want to mix politics and sport’.","Russian leader faces calls for sanctions over support for rebels in Ukraine .

"By . Martin Robinson . Thirteen children and a teacher have been injured by electric shocks after metal door handles and a fence became live at their primary school. Witnesses said the deputy headteacher at Briercliffe Primary in Burnley, Lancashire, was 'blown backwards' in one incident, suffering burns to her hands and arms. Mrs Addy was apparently hurt  after she opened the door leading to the playground while parents said their children suffered shocks from the fencing. MailOnline understands that in 'significant' parts of the school every metal object was live. Danger: Children and a teacher have been hurt after getting electric shocks off metal objects in their Lancashire primary school . Victim: Destiny Goodwin, pictured with her mother and father, said she felt a 'buzzing' up her arm after she touched the fence . Electricity North West said today they are investigating. There was a power cut in the area yesterday morning and engineers had been working on a fault at the school before the problems. The teacher and the thirteen children, aged between seven and 11, were hurt at around 1pm. Mrs Addy and five children were taken to Blackburn Infirmary while eight more pupils were treated at the scene. Parents said they had rushed to the school yesterday after students were evacuated. They were taken to shaded areas and given cold drinks until parents arrived. Destiny Goodwin, 10, a pupil in Year 6 was given a shock after touching the fencing said: 'You would touch the metal fencing in the playground and it would give you an electric shock. When you touched it you couldn’t let go straightaway.' Her mother Zoe added: “All the kids were touching the fencing at lunch time. Destiny said it was like a buzzing up her arm. I’m just upset. They’ve been sat in the shade under the trees. 'I’m not happy at all. The school has not been shut and parents didn’t find out anything.' Problems: North West Electricity said it is investigating after metal objects in significant parts of the school became live . Many parents said they had found out only when they picked up their children and saw the commotion. They said they had been left confused and angry that they had not been notified. One angry parent, who refused to be named, said: 'You don't send your child to school and expect something like this to happen. One said that she had only found out after her sister in Spain text her asking what was happening at her grandson’s school. She added: 'My sister text me from Spain asking what was going on. We didn’t have a clue. someone said that the children involved had been taken to hospital and are fine and others are being checked out here. Someone said that the teacher touched it and it blew her backwards.' Another parent whose son Kai is a pupil at the school and in Year described it as 'chaos'. She said: 'I just found out about it now on Facebook, it’s disgusting. The head teacher wouldn’t tell us which class or which children. We didn’t know whether they had been electrocuted or not. The parents are all fuming because we have not been informed. We should not have to see it on Facebook. 'We turn up at the school and ambulances are here, it’s your worst nightmare, we don’t know what’s going on it’s disorganised and they won’t let us past. We’ve been told not to touch any metal. The kids must be scared to death.' Concerns: Parents with children at Briercliff Primary said that the teacher was 'blown backwards' after touching a live object . As the children were finally let out of the school grounds around 4pm children could be overheard saying that children were left upset and some were crying from the shocks. Rob Blanchet, headteacher at Briercliffe Primary School, said: 'Earlier today, ten children and a teacher received an electric shock. The teacher has been taken to hospital and the children, who are between the age of 7 and 11, are being treated on site by paramedics. 'It is too early to say exactly what happened. The cause of the problem is currently being investigated by the electricity company. 'The school is closed at the moment until the site has been made safe. As things stand, we don’t know whether we will be able to open the school tomorrow. 'We are receiving support from safety experts and colleagues from Lancashire County Council and other organisations.'","All metal objects in 'significant' areas of Burnley primary school became live .

Allowing the clones time to regroup, the former Manchester United star then proceeds through a crowded box before controlling the ball on the line and casually backheeling it into the back of the net to claim a victory for football. 'The final 90 seconds of The Last Game prove, beyond any doubt, that brilliant football should be the only kind of football. Brilliant, creative, risk-taking football. That is what #riskeverything is all about,' said Nike’s Chief Marketing Officer Davide Grasso. Over here! Ibrahimovic shouts to Neymar to pass the ball as hundreds of clones take to the field .

"By . MailOnline Reporter . Coffee giant Starbucks has been forced once again to deny rumors that the company or its chief executive financially support Israel and its army. 'This is absolutely untrue,' the company said in a statement in response to the swelling hoax that the coffee chain and CEO Howard Schultz donate millions of dollars to support the Israel Defense Forces. 'Rumors that Starbucks or Howard provides financial support to the Israeli government and/or the Israeli Army are unequivocally false,' the Aug. 5 statement continues. 'Starbucks is a publicly held company and as such, is required to disclose any corporate giving each year through a proxy statement.' Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz has spent years denying that he sends millions of dollars to support Israel and its army . Starbucks closed its last store in Israel in 2003 amid 'operational challenges,' denying the decision had a political slant. Just three years later, there were already rumors — and calls for worldwide boycotts — claiming that the coffee chain was pumping millions into Israel's coffers, CBS reported. Starbucks first commented on the 'false rumors' in 2006. The company then posted a statement about its operations in the Middle East in 2010, but was forced to run it once again this week. Spokesman Jim Olson told CNN Money that the company re-posted the statement because of an 'uptick in false rumors out there about Starbucks and the Middle East.' Starbucks operates some 600 stores in the Middle East and North Africa, employing more than 10,000 people.","The company has spent years denying it sends parts of its profits the Israel Defense Forces .

"By . Sally Lee For Daily Mail Australia . She's a 38-year-old successful London lawyer, banker and a mother-of-two. He's a 28-year-old convicted drug smuggler who's serving a life sentence in Bali. But Scott Rush and his fiancee Nikki Butler believe their love is strong enough to conquer even the toughest conditions - including a long distance relationship from Karangasem prison in eastern Bali to London. Scroll down for video . London banker and lawyer Nikki Butler and Bali Nine drug mule Scott Rush inside Karangasem prison in eastern Bali . The smitten couple got engaged in June when Rush got down on one knee in his cell and proposed to the mother-of-two . Their love story began during a Balinese holiday in 2005 when Butler met her future fiancee, just before his arrest at a Bali airport. Ms Butler recalls the moment 'a really good looking guy' smiled at her at a bar. 'So I wondered over and that's how I met Scott Rush,' she told 60 Minutes. 'The day rolled on and we had lots more beers. 'We didn't talk too much but we had fun that day...quite hot and sweaty.' Ms Butler waited for a phone call, which had been promised by Rush, but never heard back from him. Consequently she lost touch with the 28-year-old drug smuggler during his years of incarceration. So she married and had two children. But she says she was never able to forget about Rush. Then in January last year, during her divorce, Ms Butler recognised an image of the drug criminal on British TV and contacted him straight away. 'The first thing he said to me was that ""you've come along at the right time, I was just about ready to die"",' she said. Ms Butler is a successful London banker and lawyer who leads a lavish lifestyle . The 38-year-old is pictured back at her home in London and says she was never able to forget about her romance in Bali . She reunited with Rush at his Bali jail cell in January last year when she saw him on British TV . Since February, Ms Butler has visited the 28-year-old four times in Bali . Rush, one of nine Australians jailed for attempting to traffic drugs from the Indonesian island in 2005, has battled drug problems since he was sentenced. But after being reunited with the woman of his dreams, Rush dropped to one knee and asked Ms Butler to marry him in June. 'Nikki, I love you and you love me. I think we can have a happy ending. Will you marry me?' is how he proposed. Ms Butler says she acceptance without hesitation and doubts. The smitten pair are certain that Rush's sentence will be reduced and they will be able to lead a happy life together. 'I'm afraid they may not want me as part of their society after being such an infamous criminal but I need to show people that my life is turning around, that I have a beautiful fiancee who wants to marry me,' he said. 'We're planning to have a good life and I want to be a productive member of society.' Rush described his relationship with Ms Butler: 'better than lucky, almost like destiny, almost like it was meant to be'. Rush is serving a life sentence for trafficking 1.3kg of heroin from the Indonesian island in 2005 . The convicted drug smuggler has battled drug problems since he was sentenced . 'She gives me butterflies in my stomach,' he said. 'It's the happiest thing I've had in my life. 'I can resist the drugs. Nikki's my drug now.' Rush says the love he has for his fiancee is real and has nothing to do with the financial aid he's receiving from her. 'It just seems like there's a lot of sceptics out there who believe that this is some kind of hoax,' he said. 'She helps me with money but I don't feel good about taking money from her. In fact I'm willing to make up the rest of my life to be with her and make her happy in any way that I can.' It's been more than nine years after they met for just a few hours before he was stopped with 1.3kg of the drug strapped to his body. However Ms Butler believes he's been punished enough for the crime he committed as a teenager. 'I think his crime was stupidity and I think he's paid the price for that crime,' she said. Rush hopes his sentence will be reduced so he can live happily with his future wife . At just 19 years of age Rush was committed to stand trial and sentenced to life in prison after his  arrest at a Denpasar airport with 1.8 kg of heroin concealed on his body. After an appeal he was given the death penalty - which was later overturned back to a life in 2011. Earlier this year he became the second of the Bali nine drug couriers to be moved out of Kerobokan Prison, moving to Karangasem in Bali's far east. Kerobokan prison is awash with drugs, particularly crystal methamphetamine and heroin, with the trade controlled by local gangs. The other Australians serving life sentences in Kerobokan prison are Martin Stephens, Matthew Norman, Si Yi Chen, Tan Duc Than Nguyen and Michael Czugaj. The group's ring leaders, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, still remain on death row.","Scott Rush and fiancee Nikki Butler say their love isn't a hoax .

"By . Katy Winter . Supermodel Eva Herzigova has spoken out about the new celebrity culture of sharing every aspect of their lives with fans through social media. The 40-year-old Czech beauty said that she shuns sites such as Twitter and Facebook, claiming she ‘doesn’t go out selling herself’. Speaking to Edit, Netaporter’s digital magazine, Eva talked about her incredible 24-year long career and how Hollywood’s sleazy side put her off an acting career. Eva Herzigova is the latest star of net-a-porter.com's Edit magazine. In this picture Eva wears blazer by Balmain; camisole by Equipment; pants by Jason Wu; choker by Maison Martin Margiela; ring Eva's own . Blazer, body stocking and pumps by Saint Laurent by Hedi Slimane; body by Kiki de Montparnasse . In the shoot for the magazine Eva looks sophisticated and elegant in glamourous looks by designers like Balmain, Jason Wu,  Capitol Couture by Trish Summerville, Rag & Bone, Chloé and more. In an exclusive interview, the supermodel discusses the longevity of her career which has spanned more than 24 years. ‘I’ve always worked hard and picked the right work.’ She continues, ‘In this society, where people sell their souls on Facebook and Twitter, I don’t go out there selling myself – I am very private.’ When asked about her most recent work – Marc Jacob’s final show for Louis Vuitton – she gushed about the show where she sat center of the runway on a revolving black carousel, dressed as a somber yet fabulous showgirl. ‘I saw Katie Grand, (editor and Marc Jacobs’ stylist and friend) on the Eurostar recently, and I told her I was still dazed from the beauty of the how,’ Herzigova says. 'She told me, ‘Of course you had to be there – it was for the Louis Vuitton girls.’ I have done four campaigns for them, so it was really touching.’ She reflects on her career turning point when she was featured in a Mario Testino and Carine Roitfeld editorial for The Face  saying: ‘For me, that shoot was a slap in the face to those who put me in the pin-up box. That was my jump from commercial to editorial.' She continues, 'I could hear people gasp as they realized it was me.’ Blazer by Rag & Bone; jumpsuit by Capitol Couture by Trish Summerville; pumps by Jimmy Choo; (right hand) ring Eva's own; (left hand) ring by Chloe .

Despite her success,  more than 15 years ago, the fashion world almost lost Herzigova to Hollywood, she explains. ‘After doing a few films, I went to LA looking for an agent – and it was just pathetic,’ she remembers. ‘I met people who said, ‘Yes, we can talk about the movie over dinner.’ I was like, ‘What dinner? I can just read the script here.’ Having been thus exposed to the more sleazy side of Hollywood, Herzigove quit her acting dream after a very short time. The Czech model has starred in some iconic campaigns, such as the Wonderbra Hello Boys' advert (left) Eva with fellow supermodels including Naomi Campbell at a Channel show . In regards to her personal life, now a mother of three, Herzigova admits that she never thought children were for her. She says: ‘I never saw myself as a mum. There are girls who grow up thinking of marriage and babies, but I never wanted that. But now it is everything to me. ‘When I had the first [baby], I wondered why I waited so long, but it was timing – I never had the right man before.’","Czech model disagrees with celebrity obsession with social media .

"By . Hugo Gye . Red wine drinkers are wealthier, more educated and happier than average people - but lovers of white wine are more practical, a study revealed today. The research found that it was possible to generalise about drinkers based on their favourite tipple, with those who like a glass of red being ambitious go-getters while people who prefer white are more relaxed and happy-go-lucky. And rosé drinkers are the unquestioned kings and queens of social networking, visiting sites such as Facebook multiple times every day on average. Ambitious: Red wine drinkers are well-educated and career-oriented . Those who drink red wine are more likely to have a degree, be married and drink more frequently than those who have a preference for white or rosé. White wine drinkers are home-lovers who enjoy a holiday in the UK and are content with their position on the career ladder. A spokesman for French Wines with Style, which commissioned the report, said: 'They say you can tell a lot about someone from their favourite tipple, and it seems that it is definitely the case when it comes to wine. 'From the study it looks as though those with certain personality traits are drawn to certain styles of wine.' The survey of 2,000 adults looked into everything from earnings and career prospects to personal attributes. Laid-back: White wine drinkers are content with leading a simpler life . More than half of red wine drinkers are university graduates, and they typically earn between £40-45,000 per year. And while 81 per cent are currently . happy at work, 65 per cent are still highly ambitious and want to scale . higher up the career ladder. Red wine drinkers: . Earn £40-45,000 . Are happily married . Holiday abroad . Confident, relaxed, strong, intelligent . Drink four glasses a week . White wine drinkers: . Earn £25-30,000 . Are happily single . Holiday in the UK . Practical, bright, shy, quiet . Drink three glasses a week . In comparison, a white wine drinker pockets around £25-30,000 per year, with just 43 per cent having attended university. And most are not very interested in . the corporate ladder, with more than two fifths admitting they are . really not that ambitious. 55 per cent of rosé fans leave school by the age of 18, and they go on to earn around £30,000 on average. Earn £30,000 . Happily in an unmarried relationship . Enjoy social networking . Loud, warm, charming . Drink two glasses a week . As well as being the wealthiest segment . of society, red wine drinkers are the most likely to be happily married, . as 86 per cent say they are content with the state of their . relationships. While white wine buyers are less likely to be hitched, 85 per cent of those who are single claim they are happy with their solo status. A quarter of those who enjoy a glass of red take around three overseas holidays a year, with a third also taking three or more mini breaks in the UK on top of that. White wine drinkers are more likely to holiday in the UK rather than travelling to far flung corners of the world. When asked to describe themselves, red wine drinkers are most likely to use words such as confident, relaxed, strong and intelligent. White wine drinkers tend to say they are practical, bright, shy, quiet and reserved. Rosé drinkers like to describe themselves as loud, warm and charming. The study also found that it is the rosé drinker who adores Facebook, averaging 146 friends and 13 visits to the site each week. But red wine drinkers have a greater enthusiasm for 'real' versus 'virtual' friends, and only log onto social networks such as Facebook eight times in an average week. Red wine drinkers average four glasses of their preferred wine a week, white wine fans have three while rosé drinkers average just two glasses of wine a week.","Red wine drinkers earn over £40,000 and more than half are university graduates .

"By . Associated Press . A college friend of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev plans to plead guilty to impeding the investigation into the deadly attack, his lawyer said on Wednesday. Dias Kadyrbayev, 20, is accused of removing a backpack containing emptied-out fireworks from Tsarnaev's dorm room after realizing he was suspected of carrying out the 2013 attack with his brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Prosecutors said Kadyrbayev and another friend, Azamat Tazhayakov, decided to take the items from Tsarnaev's room at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth several days after two bombs exploded near the finish line of the marathon, killing three people and injuring more than 260. Expected to plead guilty:  In this June 2, 2014, file courtroom sketch, Dias Kadyrbayev, a friend of the Boston Marathon bomber, testifies in federal court in Boston . Friends: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings, allegedly told his friend to remove the backpack from his room via text message . The items, along with Tsarnaev's laptop computer, were removed hours after the FBI publicly released photographs of Tsarnaev and his brother as suspects in the bombing. Tazhayakov was convicted last month. During his trial, witnesses said Kadyrbayev took the backpack and threw it in the trash, while Tazhayakov was convicted of agreeing with the plan to remove the items. Kadyrbayev was scheduled to go on trial next month on obstruction of justice and conspiracy charges. An electronic notice filed Wednesday said Kadyrbayev is expected to be in court Thursday for a change-of-plea hearing. His lawyer, Robert Stahl, confirmed that he intends to plead guilty, but wouldn't say whether he would admit to one or both charges. Stahl also declined to say whether he and prosecutors have agreed on a joint sentencing recommendation. The charges against both Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov carry a maximum of 25 years in prison. A spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz did not immediately return a call seeking comment. During Tazhayakov's trial, prosecutors said the items were removed from Tsarnaev's room hours after Kadyrbayev received a text message from Tsarnaev saying he could go to his dorm room and 'take what's there.' The backpack and fireworks were recovered later in a New Bedford landfill. Prosecutors said the fireworks had been emptied of explosive powder that can be used to make bombs. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a shootout with police several days after the bombings. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to 30 federal charges and faces the possibility of the death penalty if convicted. His trial is scheduled to begin in November. A third college friend, Robel Phillipos, of Cambridge, is charged with lying to federal investigators. He is scheduled to go on trial next month.

"By . Steve Hopkins . Young Iranians are having pre-marital sex, including homosexual relations, in far greater numbers than the regime in Tehran would like to admit, a report has revealed. The report, issued by Iran's parliamentary research branch and based on interviews with over 140,000 students, found 80 per cent of females acknowledged having pre-marital sex. It also found 17 per cent of those surveyed identified as homosexual. Young Iranians are engaging in pre-marital sex in far greater numbers than the regime in Tehran would like to admit, according to a government report . Women are entering into sexual relationships as early as middle school, according to the report which has been removed from the government website but obtained by FoxNews.com. The report shows the growing difference between what the regime espouses and what is actually happening in Iran where two-thirds of their 75 million population are under the age of 35. A female business student living in Tehran told the website that 'we do what we want, especially when it comes to the bedroom'. US led sanctions on Iran have also been blamed for the sexual liberation, as it has made it even more difficult for poor men to marry.

"By . Francesca Chambers for MailOnline . Bill Clinton is among the clientele of the most expensive cigar make in the world, it was revealed on Thursday. The once 'dead broke' former president is a connoisseur of His Majesty's Reserve cigars, which cost $1,000 a piece, Gurkha Cigars owner and CEO Kaizad Hansotia told Bloomberg during an interview about the company. 'Bill Clinton loves the beauties. He loves the Gurkhas,' Hansotia said. Former U.S. President Bill Clinton smokes a cigar whilst at Loch Lomond Golf Club in Scotland in 2001. Now that Clinton is a millionaire he reportedly smokes the most expensive cigar in the world . Clinton, pictured here smoking a cigar while signing books for dedicated fans who waited outside the talk show he was visiting, is said to smoke Gurkha His Royal Majesty cigars - which cost $1,000 a piece . Rolls Royce of cigars: A box of Gurkha's His Majesty's Reserve cigars goes for $25,000 . The Dominican Republic-made cigar is the 'Rolls Royce of the cigar industry,' Hansotia said, and boxes cost $25,000 a piece. That price is set to rise to $30,000 next year. Only 20 boxes of the cognac-infused cigars are produced a year, the cigar boss said, and there's a three-year waiting list. Hansotia also name-dropped Matthew McConaughey as a buyer of the company's high-end cigars, and generally noted that they are purchased by dignitaries, royal families and 'captains of the industry.' Clinton is a known aficionado of cigars, and the company has claimed in the past that he was keen on it's Grand Reserve Churchill during his presidency. That cigar sells for a substantially more modest $11.00 a piece. Others Gurkha cigars sell for as little as $2.00. Clinton was rumored to love the Gurkha Grand Reserve Churchill so much in his days at the White House that he used one to sexually gratify Monica Lewinsky during their affair. The lore has never been confirmed but independent counsel Kenneth Starr described it in a report on White House scandals. While Clinton's loyalty's elsewhere have . been called into question in the past, Gurkha says Clinton has always . fancied the company's stogies. Gurkha claimed in 2009 that it had direct knowledge that one of its cigars had a starring role in a sexual encounter between the former president and his mistress. Now that Clinton makes millions of dollars a year more than he did when he lived at the White House, the company owner's comment suggests he's moved on to a higher-end cigar.","Gurkha's CEO says Clinton 'loves' his company's cigars .

"By . Associated Press . Perhaps it was his rather suspicious-sounding name that first led police to one suspect's alleged $10,000 of marijuana. Paul Scott Stoner, 42, was charged last Thursday with growing marijuana and having a firearm while in possession of more than a pound of marijuana. The suspect, from Unionville, Virginia, had been growing thousands of dollars worth of cannabis plants at his home. Paul Scott Stoner, 42, has been charged with growing $10,000 marijuana plants at his Virginia home . The charges stemmed from an ongoing investigation related to the alleged sale of marijuana to children in Orange County. Further charges are pending. Authorities say they acted on a tip that Stoner was selling to children and during the search last Thursday seized marijuana, marijuana plants, drug paraphernalia, prescription drugs, needles, spoons and guns. The Blue Ridge Narcotics and Gang Task Force raided Stoner's home on August 14. Stoner is free on bond. A hearing is set for August 27. The Department of Social Services is also involved in the investigation.

"By . Associated Press . A Roman Catholic diocese in Ohio is discouraging its 113 schools from participating in the ice bucket challenge to benefit the ALS Association, saying the group's funding of embryonic stem cell research is 'in direct conflict with Catholic teaching.' Jim Rigg, superintendent of Catholic schools for the Archdiocese of Cincinnati, told the schools in a letter Tuesday to 'immediately cease' any plans to raise funds for the association or to instead direct donations to another organization that combats ALS, a progressive neurodegenerative disease also known as Lou Gehrig's disease that causes paralysis and almost certain death. The Catholic Church relates the use of embryonic stem cells in research to abortion and says it violates the sanctity of human life. The use of adult stem cells in research is not forbidden by Catholic teaching. Major League Baseball Commissioner-elect Rob Manfred is pictured participating in the ALS Ice-Bucket Challenge outside the organization's headquarters in New York . 'We certainly appreciate the compassion that has caused people all over the country, certainly including many Catholics, to be interacting and engaging in a fun way to support ALS research,' diocese spokesman Dan Adriacco said Thursday. 'But it's a well-established moral principle that not only the ends be good, but the means must be good, too.' The diocese said schools could participate in the ice bucket challenge, but any money raised should be directed to groups like the John Paul II Medical Research Institute in Iowa City, Iowa, which conducts 'pro-life driven' research, according to its website. Carrie Munk, a spokeswoman for the ALS Association, said her group largely funds adult stem-cell research but does fund one study involving embryonic stem cells using money from one specific donor. She said all donors to the ALS Association can stipulate where their money goes and can ask that it not pay for embryonic stem cell research. The group hasn't heard of any other Catholic dioceses in the country recommending against donating to the group, Munk said. Adriacco said the Cincinnati diocese's superintendent wrote his directive to the schools after consulting with the Catholic Conference of Ohio. The Philadelphia-based National Catholic Bioethics Center affirmed the decision Thursday, he said. Spokespeople for both groups didn't immediately return calls for comment Thursday. Don Clemmer, a spokesman for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, said that the group views the Cincinnati diocese's actions as 'a local matter' and that his organization has not issued any directives to its bishops discouraging donations to the ALS Association. Since the ice bucket challenge took over the Internet, the ALS Association received $41.8 million in donations from July 29 to Thursday. That's compared to $2.1 million in the same time period last year. Munk said the association is amazed by the wave of donations. 'I guess the most remarkable thing about this ice bucket challenge is the level of visibility it has brought to this disease,' she said. 'The dollars are incredible, but people are talking about ALS now, they're talking about research, they're talking about patients and their families. It's really so incredibly valuable.'","ALS Association's funding of embryonic stem cell research is 'in direct conflict with Catholic teaching'

"By . Associated Press . Christina Regusters, 21, is on trial on charges of kidnapping, aggravated assault and rape . A young woman charged with abducting a 5-year-old Philadelphia girl from school and raping her had frequently viewed Japanese anime depicting sexual torture, prosecutors disclosed Thursday. The evidence was revealed as the trial was delayed until next week. Prosecutors asked to introduce the video evidence involving sexual humiliation and bondage to persuade jurors that 21-year-old defendant Christina Regusters could have been the lone attacker. The girl suffered devastating injuries that required surgery. '(This) is so far out of the realm of what an average juror would be used to,' Assistant District Attorney Erin O'Brien argued. 'The only way to establish motive and intent is to introduce this evidence.' However, Common Pleas Judge Jeffrey P. Minehart found the cartoon nature of the material too far removed from the crime, and ruled it inadmissible. He also said the material is not illegal in Pennsylvania. 'I think we're stretching it to say ..., as horrid and as vulgar as these images may be, that they can then be used as proof that she sexually abused a complaining witness,' Minehart said. He agreed to revisit the decision, though, if the defense implies that Regusters could not be sexually interested in girls or that other people must be involved. The 5-year-old victim was signed out at this Philadelphia school by a woman claiming to be her mother. She was missing for the next 20 hours . The child was discovered the next day, about 4:40am, after a man walking by heard her screams from this playground . Prosecutors will be allowed to present accusations that the former day care worker had molested a young female relative, and Minehart also allowed in computer searches about Muslim clothing and the destruction of DNA. Police believe Regusters donned Muslim garb to pose as the child's mother and remove her from her kindergarten at Bryant Elementary School in west Philadelphia in January 2013, telling a substitute teacher she was taking her out for breakfast. The crime stunned some parents in the city, given that the girl was abducted from her classroom and the only person charged was a woman. The girl was blindfolded for much of her 18-hour ordeal, but later helped lead police to Regusters by describing details including a talking bird she heard in the house where she was held. She was found shivering under playground equipment, partially clothed, early the next morning. The girl had been abducted from her school around 8:50am by a woman dressed in a burkha who called herself 'Tiffany' 'I've been stolen,' she said to the man who found her. Regusters had searched for the graphic anime just six hours before the 8:50 a.m. school abduction, O'Brien said. She had also searched for her criminal record and that of her father, she said, as Regusters fidgeted with a paper clip at the defense table. The details of those possible criminal records weren't revealed. The trial, scheduled to start Thursday, was delayed until Monday to empanel more jurors and give defense lawyer W. Fred Harrison Jr. time to explore the new evidence. He had previously hoped to show at trial that other people were involved. 'The sexual events that take place in these animated pictures, that's not what happened in this case,' Harrison argued Thursday. The victim, now 7, is expected to testify next week. Prosecutors had originally planned to have her give videotaped testimony, but withdrew the motion Thursday, saying the jury needs to weigh her credibility. Her family has a civil suit pending against the city.","Christina Regusters, 21, is accused of abducting a Philadelphia girl in 2013 .

"By . Stephen Wright . and Tom Kelly . and Becky Evans . The wife of Rolf Harris has spoken of her concern for her husband's health since his arrest on suspicion of sexual offences. Alwen Hughes said the legendary entertainer has struggled to sleep since he was quizzed and later arrested by detectives investigating the Jimmy Savile sex scandal. The 83-year-old denies the allegations and has not been seen in public since they were first reported last week. Scroll down for video . Alwen Hughes said husband Rolf Harris (pictured together) has struggled to sleep since his arrest . Welsh sculptress and jeweller Alwen, who married Harris in 1958, has told a friend how worried she is for her husband, who has suffered depression in the past. Harris, pictured walking in London's Soho, is understood to deny the allegations . She told the friend: 'My poor husband. It's terrible, we've been really worrying about it. 'We've both been having sleepless nights over it all', according to The Sunday Mirror. The couple have one daughter, Bindi, who is also an artist. Harris was quizzed by Operation Yewtree detectives in November and arrested three weeks ago. The friend, who says he has known the couple for more than 50 years, was quoted in The Sunday Mirror as saying: 'Rolf is a lovely, loyal devoted husband and father and I can't imagine him ever doing anything to tarnish his image.' Metropolitan Police detectives now plan to fly to Harris' native Australia to interview two potential witnesses, according to the Sydney Sunday Telegraph. Harris – a favourite of the Queen – had been the only high-profile Operation Yewtree suspect not to have been identified by the mainstream media. Lawyers at London law firm Harbottle & Lewis had sent threatening letters to newspapers in a bid to stop the arrest being reported. They cited Lord Justice Leveson’s controversial proposal that the public should be prevented from knowing the names of arrested suspects in all but ‘exceptional’ circumstances. Scroll down for video . Going for a walk: Australian entertainer Harris was pictured outside his Berkshire home in January with a dog . One publisher was told there was ‘no public interest’ in revealing his identity, it was claimed. Yesterday Harris kept silent after The Sun revealed that he had been arrested over historic sex abuse allegations. The aggressive tactics used by his lawyers, who declined to comment yesterday, deepened the row over ‘secret arrests’. The tersely written letters from Harbottle & Lewis were sent amid mounting concern in the media about plans to ban the public from knowing the names of police suspects who have been arrested but not yet charged. Detectives are planning to travel to Australia to interview potential witnesses into the Harris allegations . The allegations do not involve disgraced Savile, who last year – following his death – was revealed to be Britain’s worst paedophile. Harris’s accuser is a woman who claims she was sexually assaulted by him when she was a teenager. Published: The Sun produced a 'dummy' front page before later printing details of Harris's arrest (pictured) Although he vehemently denies the allegations, he has declined to issue a formal statement. Channel 5 has pulled Harris's programmes pending the outcome of the police investigation. ‘While this legal matter involving Rolf Harris is on-going we have removed Olive the Ostrich and the repeats of Rolf’s Animal Clinic from the schedule,’ a spokesman said. At last summer’s Diamond Jubilee concert at Buckingham Palace, Harris famously led the crowd – including Princess Anne – in an impromptu rendition of Two Little Boys, his 1969 Christmas No 1 hit. He is also famed for his 1957 song Tie Me Kangaroo Down Sport. Harris's arrest comes after the arrests of pop star Gary Glitter, comedian Freddie Starr, DJ Dave Lee Travis, publicist Max Clifford and comedian Jim Davidson. Starr, Travis, Clifford and Davidson have all publicly denied any wrong-doing and gave statements after their arrests. Critics say Yewtree, set up in the . aftermath of the Savile scandal, has turned into a ‘celebrity . witch-hunt’ and police are arresting suspects on flimsy evidence.

Harris was first . interviewed under caution – but not arrested – over alleged sex offences . on November 29 after attending a police station by appointment.

"By . Sally Lee For Daily Mail Australia . At the controls of a blazing and doomed airship, Australian pilot Michael Nerandzic's mind turned to his passengers. The 51-year old was preparing to land at an airfield in west Germany in June 2011 when trouble struck and fuel caught fire at the rear of the Goodyear blimp. Lowering the craft just enough for his three passengers to jump clear, the shift in weight sent the airship rapidly skyward and Mr Nerandzic to a fiery death. Australian pilot Mike Nerandzic, pictured in Goodyear Blimp 'Spirit of Safety I', died in the crash . The burning wreckage of the airship. The pilot was killed in the accident, but he managed to save his passengers . Described as an ultimate professional, Mr Nerandzic's wife Lyndy said he would have known what was ahead after the passengers jumped. 'He knew exactly what he was doing that day,' she said. For his selflessness, Mr Nerandzic will posthumously receive the Star of Courage, one of Australia's most prestigious civilian awards. Mr Nerandzic, who had more than 12,300 hours of ­experience, will be the 143rd recipient of the Australian Bravery Decoration awarded by Governor-General Sir Peter Cosgrove. His wife Lyndy Nerandzic, who lives in Berkeley on the NSW south coast, told the Sydney Morning Herald her late husband had already received two other bravery awards but had no idea he had been nominated for this particular honour. The Goodyear blimp falls to the ground after the incident in Friedberg, Germany in June 2011 . The pilot managed to get near enough the ground for passengers to escape before climbing back up . 'He loved what he did, he absolutely loved it, he always wanted to fly,' she said. 'The one thing he always said was ""Don't worry, you'll never die in an airship, they're so safe"".' However she hopes the award will help keep Mr Nerandzic's legacy alive. 'When Michael told them to jump, he knew then it would send him straight back into the sky,' she also told the Daily Telegraph. 'He's not just gone and disappeared,' she said. 'He's recognised for an act he did...it makes it easier.' His award will be one of 78 Australian Bravery Awards and 22 Bravery Medals announced by Governor-General Sir Peter Cosgrove on Monday.","A Goodyear blimp burst into flames and plunged to the ground in Germany in 2011 .

"By . Chris Pleasance . At least eight tornadoes touched down in Colorado yesterday afternoon, including one that dropped down near a junior golf tournament injuring one person. A tornado touched down near the Blackstone Country Club, southeast of Denver, causing one minor injury after high winds blew a golf cart on top of a caddy walking nearby. Paul Cleveland, 16, who was playing in the tournament, said he and two other people were riding a golf cart when they saw a funnel cloud heading in their direction, swirling debris. Scroll down for videos . Eight tornadoes touched down in Colorado yesterday, including this one near Florissant. One man in his fifties suffered minor injuries near Denver after another twister blew a golf cart on top of him . Denver residents took to social media to post their pictures of the storm, including Joe Wyka who took this tornado selfie near Florissant . A golf caddy was injured at this golf course near Denver after a golf cart was blown on top of him. This empty trailer was also flipped over as high winds threw debris around . 'I ducked down, protected my head and waited for the worst,' he said. Moments later, Cleveland said, the twister lifted the cart and threw it on top of a caddy walking nearby. The caddy, a man in his 50s, was taken to a hospital with minor injuries, said Capt. Diane Lord with the Aurora Fire Department. The strong winds also flipped over an empty trailer, with no other injuries reported. Six of the tornadoes struck in northeast Colorado, while two others hit in Park County in the center of the state, the National Weather Service said on its website. At least three of them caused damage. The severe weather was moving toward central Nebraska and western Kansas overnight before heading into Arkansas and Missouri, Weather Service meteorologist Frank Cooper said. In Colorado, a funnel cloud touched down near Fairplay about 65 miles southwest of Denver at about 11 a.m., damaging the roof of a home, Park County spokeswoman Linda Balough said. 'This is amazingly unusual at 10,000 feet, very unusual for it to happen up here,' she said. A tornado was also spotted near Fairplay, Park County (pictured). A spokeswoman for the county said it was 'amazingly unusual' for twisters to form at that altitude . A tornado touched ground in Teller County, near Colorado Springs, as hail storms battered cars and homes . Another tornado was reported a short time later, about 40 miles away near Lake George, and caused 'substantial' damage at an RV park, Balough said, although nobody was injured. Weather Service meteorologist Kyle Fredin said a trough of low pressure created a 'large extensive line' of severe weather along the Front Range from southern Colorado to the Wyoming border. A twister also touched down in a sparsely . populated area of southeast Wyoming, but there were no immediate . reports of injuries or major damage. A tornado watch for all of eastern Colorado extends to 8 p.m. Sunday as the band of severe weather heads to the Plains states. The storm will hover over eastern Colorado on Monday, bringing heavy rain in Burlington, before a fine night on Monday and a dry morning for most of the state on Tuesday. There will be scattered showers throughout Tuesday afternoon which will give way to widespread rain on Wednesday, with the possibility of snow showers in some central areas. Twisters are seen forming in the air above Stausburg near the I70 in Colorado yesterday afternoon . The most damaging storm ever to hit . Colorado came in July 1990 as hail and strong winds caused more than . $1billion (£60million) worth of damage, according to the Rocky Mountain . Insurance Information Association. That storm only featured two weak tornadoes, with most of the damage being caused by golf ball sized hailstones battering homes and cars. The costliest bad weather season came five years ago when more hail and wind caused $1.4billion worth of damage across the state. Colorado's hail season runs from mid-April to mid-August. The state is home to 'Hail Alley,' which receives the highest frequency of large hail in North America and most of the world . Monday evening will be clear after earlier showers in the east as the storm passes out of the state . Tuesday will be largely clear until about 5pm when there will be light showers across central areas . Wednesday will be clear in the morning, but by early afternoon rain will arrive for most of the state, though there are no signs of the storms returning .","At least eight tornadoes touched down in Colorado yesterday .

"By . Associated Press . A Colorado man is under arrest after leading authorities on a high-speed chase for some 163 miles in a stolen car in Wyoming. The Wyoming Highway Patrol arrested 25-year-old Martin Anderson of Peyton, Colorado, along with a teenage boy on Tuesday. Officers had to deploy four rounds of stop sticks before they were finally able to stop the 2013 Dodge Charger near Elk Mountain, Wyoming. The car was reported stolen from Colorado Springs on July 30. Martin Anderson, 25, allegedly led authorities on a 163-mile pursuit in Wyoming driving this Dodge Charger, which police said was stolen from Colorado Springs . Then on Tuesday, cops in Riverton, Wyoming, spotted the vehicle after a 911 caller reported a gray Dodger Charger appeared to have been involved in a drug deal, according to KTVQ. At first, Anderson and his passenger, who has not been named, put their hands outside the vehicle in an apparent sign of surrender, according to the station. But once the officers got close, Anderson allegedly took off, at times reaching speeds of up to 140 mph during the chase. The pursuit had to be suspended twice, once when Anderson swerved at multiple . troopers and into oncoming traffic north of Rawlins, Wyoming, and again when he . entered the city limits, said Wyoming Highway Patrol spokesman Sgt. David Wagener . 'He apparently knew that law enforcement would not endanger other traffic and that is why we think that's what his motive was,' Capt. Eric Murphy told KTVQ . An unmarked police vehicle continued to follow Anderson and officers retook the chase once he was out on Interstate 80. 'He attempted to run multiple vehicles off the road head on,' Undersheriff Ryan Lee, of the Fremont County Sheriff's office, told County10. Police found two handguns inside his car, both of which were within Anderson's reach during the chase. The teenager's relationship to Anderson remains unclear. Cops have not said whether he will be charged with a crime. No injuries were reported.","Martin Anderson, 25, was arrested near Elk Mountain, Wyoming, after speeding away from cops in a stolen Dodge Charger .

"By . Gemma Mullin for MailOnline . Colin Birdsall, 72, who died when his organs failed was due to be buried in a metal coffin last Thursday . A family were left horrified after council officials turned up at their father's funeral to tell them they couldn't bury him in a metal coffin because they are banned. Stella Birdsall, 48, ordered a £3,000, vacuum-sealed, navy blue metal casket with steel handles for her father Colin, 72, but  his funeral in Knottingley, West Yorkshire was halted last Thursday. She said the service at St Botolph’s Church ‘went beautifully’ but then the official ‘ambushed’ the funeral cortege beside the open grave. Miss Birdsall, a control room operator, said he told the family that the interment could not go ahead because it breached Wakefield Council’s policy barring the use of metal caskets – and that she had two options, either to postpone the burial or to change the casket. ‘Everybody was in a state of shock,’ she said. ‘I was dumbfounded.’ 'A council official was on the phone in front of the coffin and no one knew what was going on. 'After about 10 minutes, we were told the council wouldn't allow us to bury my dad because his casket was metal. 'We were all in total shock. We were given two options, whether to postpone the burial or to swap dad’s coffin and continue. 'We chose the latter because all the guests were already there, but we never had a choice in the coffin.' After a hurried discussion, the family decided that the hearse should return to the undertaker’s parlour so that the body could be transferred into a wooden coffin. She said her father’s body was put in a plain, plywood box which was the only one they had in stock. 'There was then confusion over which way my father was laying and he was spun twice over his own grave,' she added. 'Before we left the cemetery, the bulldozers were already filling in the earth. The navy metal coffin which Colin Birdsall was due to be buried in (pictured) was banned by Wakefield Council . Mr Birdsall's family members gathered beside the hearse ready to carry his coffin at funeral last Thursday . 'But because the grave was dug for the original metal casket, which was bigger than the one he ended up in, there were two feet spare all the way round the edge. 'There musn’t have been enough soil to properly fill the grave so it had already sunk by the time I visited again on Friday. 'I am devastated and very angry. He was just discarded like a piece of rubbish. Stella Birdsall, 48, held the funeral service in St Botolph’s Church, in Knottingley, West Yorkshire (pictured) 'The whole ordeal was just absolutely disgusting. There was no compassion, respect or dignity. I wanted that day to be perfect because it was the last thing I could have doen for my dad. 'The council ruined that and I can never get that day back. Our lasting memories of dad are of this, it is heartbreaking and has been haunting me ever since.' His family were forced to bury him in a wooden coffin at the last minute after they were told by the council at the funeral they could not use the metal one . Her brother Reece Birdsall, 38, said: 'Instead of talking about my dad’s life, people are talking about the utter farce of the funeral. It is a disgrace.' Miss Birdsall said the way her father- a former contractor - was treated on the day of the funeral was worse than the day he died. 'What happened that day, as horrible as it was, could not have been avoided but what happened at his funeral could have, and should have, been avoided. 'It had gone to far by that point, if they had a problem with the coffin they should have told us before we got to the graveside.' Their father passed away after a long illness where his organs failed. Miss Birdsall said she did not blame the undertaker, Jennings Funeral Services, but added: ‘It was like Wakefield Council ambushed my father’s burial.’ Miss Birdsall said she is looking at exhuming her father’s body for reburial in a more suitable coffin. She added: ‘Nobody has been talking about what a beautiful service it was. It has all been about what happened at the graveside.’ Wakefield Council has since apologised for the incident and said it would make arrangements for Mr Birdsall to be reburied in the original metal coffin and would cover the costs. Glynn Humphries, the council’s service director for environmental and street scene, said: 'We would like to apologise to Ms Birdsall and her family for the distress out actions caused them during what was already a very difficult time. 'Having looked into the issue we could have acted differently and, on this occasion, carried out the family’s wished and given them the funeral they originally planned, including the metal casket.'","Stella Birdsall, 48, ordered navy blue metal coffin to bury her father Colin in .

And even upon a closer look, the extraordinarily detailed images seem too life-like to be anything but a high-definition picture. But the hyper-realistic works are in fact paintings, created in a London studio by a budding 23-year-old artist. Michael Sydney Moore describes his work as 'centred around high-realism' in portraiture. Scroll down for video . Untitled 13 (left) and Untitled (right) were created by the artist, Michael Sydney Moore, using oil on canvas and are among the 23-year-old's collection of life-like paintings . The artist usually takes between eight and 12 weeks to complete one of the portraits and works from a photograph taken of the subject in his London studio . Using oil on canvas the artist describes his work as 'centred around high-realism in portraiture' but said he tends to 'shy away' from labels such as hyper-realism or photo-realism . The process begins by the artist visiting a client to take their photograph or have them come to his London studio. More than 100 images are taken until he is satisfied with three . Working from his London studio, he takes between eight and 12 weeks to complete an oil portrait after photographing the subject. 'I use oils primarily because of the way it interacts with light. This serves to give a greater sense of depth. 'I like the solitary nature of painting. In a world saturated with technological stimulus it can be very redemptive to sit alone in silence painting for long stretches of time,' he said. 'The intricate nature of painting realism affords a kind of meditative state which can be deeply nourishing when going well; the flip side of this of course is the low that comes from long periods of what you might call artistic block.' The process begins with the artist visiting a client at home or inviting them to his studio for photographs. He takes more than 100 until he is satisfied. 'This stage usually takes around two hours. More than a hundred photos are taken until a set of three are chosen that I like. 'This informs a series of tonal drawings that allow me to better judge which would best suit a painting. The painting process itself takes around 6 - 9 weeks. 'Towards the end of the portrait a further sitting of an hour will be performed to further compare my values against those of the painting. Once the painting is complete it will be unveiled to the client. 'This can either involve a private unveiling at my studio or the painting being sent to your address. 'From inception to completion a portrait normally takes around 8-12 weeks to complete.' Untitled 13 will be on display at Mall Galleries in London from September 25, while Untitled has been sold to a private collector for an unknown sum. The artist then works from tonal drawings to complete the portrait with oil paints. Untitled 13 will be on display at the Mall Galleries in London from September 25 . After photographing his subject, the artist takes more than 100 images back to his studio to begin work using a variety of brush-strokes and hues . Untitled 13 will be on public display next month while Untitled was sold to a private collector for an unknown sum. Portraits by the artist start at £3,400 and vary in size . Portraits by the artist start at £3,400 for 130cm x 90cm with larger canvasses (160cm x 110cm) costing £5,000, and are restricted to human subject matters. Describing his technique, Sydney Moore says:'I do not believe there is any dichotomy present in the idea that an almost perfect rendition of the human form can also be intensely expressive. 'Expression in painting - for me at least - comes from the deeply individual and selective nature the artist's voice carries. 'Where I choose to apply paint thickly or turn form using a particular hue, are as intrinsic to the expressive nature of painting as the selection of a particular word is to a poet. 'To extend the metaphor; as in poetry, it is not the correct selection of words, as much as it is their ability to co-exist harmoniously with both a semblance of reality and the artist's sentiments on the world - or in my case - the sitter present.'

"By . Mark Duell for MailOnline . A romantic 76-year-old grandfather has written a heartfelt book of poems to his ailing wife to celebrate every year they have spent together. Len Biddlecombe, of Shotley, Suffolk, has now had the book published - having penned a poem for each of the 48 years he has been with Barbara, 71. Sadly she can no longer talk and struggles to walk after being struck down by Alzheimer’s disease – but Mr Biddlecombe still dedicates his life to being by her side at a nursing home in Ipswich. Couple: Len Biddlecombe, 76, has penned a poem for each of the years he has been with his wife Barbara, 71 . Wedding day: The couple married (left) almost half a century ago at Ipswich Register Office in Suffolk in 1968. They are also pictured (right) soon after their big day . He now spends his time comforting her and recalling their happy times together. He said he was proud to have the poems published as a book - which is appropriately named Life of Love. Mr Biddlecombe added: ‘I wrote the earlier ones about her and as we had our family they came into it. Then as time went on they were more for her than about her. ‘It’s the complete kaleidoscope of our life, from when we first got together to today.’ The couple met in 1966 and have been married for 46 years after being set up by Mrs Biddlecombe’s father. They went on to have three children and three grandchildren. He said: ‘It was love at first sight for me - Barbara was the most beautiful person I’d ever seen. I stopped writing after she went in the home. I did insist on writing a final poem to finish the book off. Smiles: Mr and Mrs Biddlecombe on their last holiday together in Kessingland, Suffolk, four years ago . Portrait: Mr and Mrs Biddlecombe pictured in 2000. The couple have three children and three grandchildren . Life of Love: Mr Biddlecombe said he was proud to have his many poems for his wife published as a book . ‘But we had to draw a line under that part of our life. Barbara doesn’t quite comprehend any more. ‘But she does tend to smile. She liked . the little picture of us on the back cover but she doesn’t understand . the wording. Every story I’ve written I read to her before I even did . anything with it.’ 'It’s the complete kaleidoscope of our life, from when we first got together to today' Len Biddlecombe . The couple married at Ipswich Register Office in 1968 and lived in Shotley all their married life apart from a short spell in nearby Holbrook. Mr Biddlecombe worked as a self-employed taxi driver before retiring while his wife took care of the home and spent her time painting. ‘The best poem in the book is the one I wrote when our first child was born, one of life’s most precious moments,’ he added. ‘It describes the thrill of holding your baby for the first time, something that many people can relate to.’ It’s life’s most precious moment between a man and his wife, . When they are together and produce their first new life. It often starts when he’s asleep at 3am or so, . She wakes her weary partner and says ‘It’s time to go.’ Her bag is packed and ready; they’ve rehearsed it all before. There’s no need to panic, but he does that’s for sure! A quick drive to the hospital, there won’t be long to wait, . If only he could keep awake it really would be great. Everything is ready, no need to induce; . Contractions getting regular, she’s ready to produce. Suffering hours of labour she screams out in pain, . ‘I’ll never let you put me through all this again.’ You hold her hand so tightly but she grips you like a vice. Caesarean is called for, Oh God it isn’t nice. But now you hold your baby, you and proud mum there, . It is Life’s most precious moment, each of you can share. Life of Love by Len Biddlecombe was published in paperback on May 27. It is available on Amazon for £4.73, or for  £1.83 on Kindle . The time has come to draw a close to the poems I’ve written for you, . Our truly wonderful lifetime of love is very nearly through. After I wrote the last one I found it hard to understand . My life received a nasty shock when fate called and took a hand. You were diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, a disease so cruel and sad . It drove a wedge between our love and all the fun we’d had. Well over a thousand words I’ve penned especially for you, . I’d gladly write a thousand more if you’d understand a few . But your powers of observation and the precious gift of speech . Both have sadly left you and are now well out of reach. You’re living in a silent world with normal feelings gone . And yet you’re never giving up, you just keep struggling on. I see you every single day though you’re in full time care . I cry myself to sleep each night because you’re never there. I’m not looking for your sympathy for me or for my wife . We’ve both been very lucky in a long and happy life, . Some people have no life at all or are cut down in their prime . Victims of an accident or a cruel and hideous crime . So when the curtain closes and the call comes from above . I pray we’ll be together to share another lifetime of true love.","Len Biddlecombe, of Shotley, Suffolk, has penned poems for Barbara, 71 .

"By . David Kent . England are optimistic a fourth FIFA Women's World Cup campaign can be their most successful yet, as Mark Sampson's team made sure of qualification in ruthless fashion. A 4-0 victory over Wales means England have booked their place at Canada 2015 with a game to spare. They will head to Montenegro next month aiming to complete a perfect 10 out of 10 record after nine straight wins to date. Made it: The England team celebrate after qualifying for the World Cup in Canada in 2015 . Needing just a point at the Cardiff City Stadium, Karen Carney's early opening goal set up the visitors for a comfortable night against opponents who could still join them in Canada next year through the play-offs. Eniola Aluko, Laura Bassett and Lianne Sanderson added goals before half-time, and England, who have taken inspiration from the national women's rugby team's World Cup triumph, were able to cruise from there on. Managed by a Welshman in 31-year-old former Swansea City centre of excellence boss Sampson, England look a different team to the side easily picked apart at last summer's European Championships, when they managed just one point from three group games. A set of players wracked with anxiety at Euro 2013 now revel in each other's company, sharing in coffee clubs and socialising together, carrying their bond onto the pitch. Strike: Eniola Aluku scores the second goal in the 4-0 win over Wales . Sanderson has been an early beneficiary of the new era, having retired from international football four years ago, as a 22-year-old, when her testy relationship with then manager Hope Powell became irreconcilable. Sampson, appointed in December after the team played their first four qualifiers under caretaker boss Brent Hills, immediately summoned the Boston Breakers striker across the Atlantic for a winter training camp in Spain. She instantly bonded with team-mates she feared might cold-shoulder her. England set up in an attacking formation, with three strikers in Sanderson, Aluko and Toni Duggan and the inventive Carney playing just behind as she won a 98th cap. Carney's opening goal in the 16th minute was ostensibly a fluke, her curling free-kick from the left being missed by Aluko and deceiving goalkeeper Nicola Davies on its way inside the far post. Jordan Nobbs drifted a 20-yard effort against the top of the Wales crossbar as England sought a swift second. Rounded off: England forward Lianne Sanderson (left) celebrates after scoring the fourth England goal . That extra cushion came in the 39th minute when Aluko produced an explosive finish, taking down a throw-in from the right and lashing the ball across Davies. It was 3-0 by the 44th minute as centre-back Bassett, selected ahead of former captain Casey Stoney, prodded home a left-wing corner from Carney. Sanderson punished shaky defending just a minute later when the mohawked striker darted into space to head in right-back Alex Scott's pacey cross. Sampson told BBC Three: 'It's a special moment. We wanted to come here and do the job and I thought for spells in the first half we were outstanding. 'The objective was to win and to play well and qualify, and there was loads of good play in our performance. 'We've finally made it to Canada. 'We're excited by it, with the way we're playing at the moment, but there's lots more to come from this group.'","A 4-0 victory over Wales means England have booked their place at Canada 2015 with a game to spare .

"By . Larisa Brown . When John Carter died of a brain tumour, his parents found comfort in the knowledge his heart would save someone else’s life. But they had no idea whose ... until an amazing chance encounter five years later brought them together with the man rescued by the transplant. The 19-year-old stranger was giving a reading at a memorial service when John’s mother Freda broke down in tears and said: ‘This person’s got my son’s heart.’ Chance encounter: Freda Carter (left) instinctively recognised Scott Rutherford (right) as the teenager who was given her son John's heart when she heard him speak at a memorial service for organ donors . Mother and son: Mrs Carter with her son John before his death at the age of 33. She says her 'dying wish' was to feel his heart beat again . It turned out her hunch was correct. And after the service Mrs Carter embraced the young man and put her hand on his chest to feel her son’s heartbeat once again. Yesterday, the 66-year-old told how she had always wanted to trace the person who had been given John’s heart but hospital rules forbade it. All they knew was that he was called Scott and had been 14 when the transplant took place. That was until last November when the couple, from Sunderland, attended the memorial service for organ donors. As Scott Rutherford gave the reading, Mrs Carter said she instinctively knew her son’s heart was beating inside him. ‘I sat down and turned the page on the order of service and saw his name there and a strange feeling came over me,’ she said. ‘I knew he was the recipient of John’s heart. It was irrational as Scott is a common name and he could have been anywhere in the country. ‘But I was completely hysterical. I couldn’t breathe and started making a massive scene. I think it must have been maternal instinct.’ She added: ‘I have always said since John passed away that my dying wish, the one thing I wanted to do in life, was to meet the boy who got his heart and to feel our John’s beat again. It was a complete miracle that he was standing in front of us.’ Nurses present at St George’s in Newcastle realised Mrs Carter was upset and brought her to the back of the church. Life saving: Scott, pictured as a 14-year-old in hospital was born with a disorder called transposition of the great arteries and when he received John's heart he was just hours away from death . Teenager: Scott in hospital five days after his operation. He says that growing up he had 'barely any life', and as his heart problems worsened he 'just wanted to die' They sat and listened to Mr Rutherford speak of how his life was saved at 14 when he received a heart from a man named John. Mrs Carter’s instinct was confirmed. She was so desperate to meet him that the nurses took the unusual decision to ask him after checking things over with the Freeman Hospital, where he had received his heart. Mrs Carter, a retired carer, said: ‘Scott came up to me and opened his arms and gave me a huge hug. ‘He said he would be eternally grateful for what we have done for him. I asked him if I could feel John’s heart beat and he let me. It was all I wanted.’ Her husband, a 70-year-old retired engineer, added: ‘John lives on through him. He isn’t dead really.’ John, a spray painter, died in 2008 at the age of 33. His family decided to donate his organs so others could be saved. Mr Rutherford was just hours from death when he received the heart. The actor had been born with a rare disorder that affected his arteries. He said: ‘When I was growing up, I had barely any life. I was miserable and when my heart problems got worse I just wanted to die. ‘I am unbelievably thankful to John and his family for everything that they have done for me. ‘The difference in my health is amazing.’ With the help of the new heart, Mr Rutherford was able to pursue his dream of studying performing arts and went on to graduate from Newcastle College with a distinction. He described his chance meeting with the Carters as ‘some sort of miracle’. Lynn Holt, heart and lung transplant coordinator at the Freeman hospital, said: ‘I can think of only a few occasions when I was involved with the organ donor’s family meeting their recipient. It is an amazing result and I know that Scott was so happy that he got to meet the family. He was over the moon.’ On the road to recovery: A smiling Scott pictured in his hospital bed nine days after his life-saving surgery, when he was beginning to feel well again . Tragedy: John's family had always wanted to meet the person who had been given his heart but hospital rules forbid this unless the recipient requests it of their own accord . Miraculous: Scott describes the day he met the Carters as 'unbelievable', and 'some sort of miracle', and says he will always be grateful to the family . New opportunities: Following his operation Scott says the difference in his health was 'amazing', and as he got older he was able to pursue his dream of studying performing arts and becoming an actor . Chance encounter: Mrs Carter and her husband John, 70, said they were 'gobsmacked' to have been given the chance to meet Scott at the church, where they heard him speak about how his life was saved by their son . Family: The Carters, pictured with John before his death, said their son lives on through Scott, and they are 'over the moon', to have been able to help the teenager .","Freda Carter's son John, 33, died from a brain tumour in 2008 .

"By . Lillian Radulova For Daily Mail Australia . Australian property seekers will be given a chance to live beside a piece of history when the childhood home of Ned Kelly goes up for auction next month. The infamous bushranger's now heritage listed cottage in Beveridge south of Melbourne where he grew up with seven siblings, has been kept in its original condition, according to the estate's agent Andrew Bellino from Ray White. It remains unchanged since 1859 when Kelly's father built it a few years after his son was born, using the land to graze his dairy cattle. Mr Bellino told Daily Mail Australia that due to the property's unique historical value, no starting price had been set for the auction day and they were 'leaving it up to the market to determine the value'. Scroll down for video . Ned Kelly's first childhood home in Beveridge south of Melbourne, was placed on the market on Friday and is set to be auctioned off on September 20 . Built in 1859 by Ned's father John 'Red' Kelly, the Irish style cottage is heritage listed and remains in its original condition . Buyers will also be the owners of a federation-style residence only 207 metres from the Kelly house . John 'Red' Kelly built his family’s first home using materials he could scavenge from the bush, including local bluestone for the endearing chimney. Complete with an earthen floor and drainage running between the two rooms, Kelly's home was built as a typical Irish style wooden cottage, according to the Property Observer. But buyers won't be forced to live in the previous millennium if they secure the historic purchase. Set on a 3.5 acre block of land, the property also includes a federation-style home, only 207 metres from the heritage listed cottage. With a front-line view of Mt Fraser, the four-bedroom residence is complete with time-period features including high ceilings and a fireplace . The former Kelly residence stands in complete contrast to the new residence, built from materials scavenged from the bush . The Irish cottage still has its earthen floor and drainage running between the two rooms . With a front-line view of Mt Fraser, the four-bedroom residence is complete with time-period features including high ceilings and a fireplace. The Beveridge property did not remain the Kelly family’s residence for long however, with the family moving on not long after Red’s death in 1866 when they moved to Eleven Mile Creek. It was not long after that Ned Kelly’s first run in with the law occurred, leading to a whole range of jail sentences that eventually saw him shot down in his iconic armour at the Glenrowan siege. The property at 44 Kelly Street Beveridge will go up for auction on September 20.

"By . Julian Robinson . A mother who took her son to Majorca during term-time to say goodbye to his dying grandfather has landed herself a criminal record. Sally Randall, 35, pleaded guilty to a truancy charge when she appeared at Blackburn Magistrates’ Court, Lancashire. She had taken son James, 13, on a ten-day break, which was the dying wish of her father-in-law Graham Crisp. He had pancreatic cancer and died three months later. Sally Randall, centre, with her mother, Lavinia Crisp and her children, James, 13, behind her and Joe, five, and Beaudie, three sitting on her knees. She was hauled to court after the family went on holiday to Majorca during term time with terminally ill grandfather Graham Crisp . Ms Randall said she had asked Norden High School, Rishton, Lancashire, for permission to take her teenage son James out of class for the trip but the request was refused because it was not ‘an exceptional circumstance’. This week, she appeared at Blackburn Magistrates’ Court where she was given a six-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay a £15 victim surcharge after pleading guilty to failing to send a child to school. She had wanted to plead not guilty but was told the only defences available to her were that the headteacher had authorised the absence; sickness covered by medical evidence; religious observance; or failure by the local authority to provide transport. As none of these applied to her situation Ms Randall pleaded guilty, but explained to magistrates why she had taken her child out of school. Graham Crisp died of pancreatic cancer three months after the family holiday in Majorca . Ms Randall, who has two other sons Joe, five, and Beaudie, three, told the court she went ahead with the holiday, which was being paid for by James’ grandparents, as she wanted to fulfil Mr Crisp’s wish of a last family break. In court she said: 'It was his last holiday with his grandchildren. 'I feel it’s an exceptional circumstance, because of the memories and photographs we’ve got from this holiday.' But on her return, the part-time support worker, who is sole carer for her three sons, was issued with a £120 fine. Parents of children aged five to 16 are legally responsible for ensuring they attend school regularly - unless they are home educated. They have to ask permission from the headteacher if they want to take their children out of school during term time. But it can only be done if an application is made to the headteacher in advance or if it is in 'exceptional circumstances'. It is down to the headteacher to decide whether they then allow the pupil to take time off. Various options are available to headteachers, social workers or police including issuing parents with penalty notices between £60 and £120 if parents have not taken action or asked for help. If this is not paid, a prosecution will follow - and this can lead to a fine of up to £2,500, a three-month jail term or a community sentence. The paperwork was sent to her old address, and because she had not been able to pay the fixed penalty she was forced to appear in court. She told magistrates that the holiday had initially been planned for the Easter holidays, but Mr Crisp was taken ill and had to undergo a course of chemotherapy, which meant that the holiday had to be postponed until September. She said she had approached the school, but had been told by the headteacher, Tim Mitchell, that it was not in his power to grant the leave. Speaking after the hearing, she said she would now have a criminal record for the next six months until it was spent. 'It’s upsetting because I’ve never been in trouble with the police in my life,' she said. 'I don’t see why I should have something on my record, no matter how small. 'I understand I broke the law, but if the headteacher doesn’t think a grandparent dying is an exceptional circumstance then I don’t know what is. 'I think it’s disgusting. Graham is dead now. As soon as we came back from holiday he was more or less in the hospice. Sally Randall said she had asked Norden High School, Rishton, Lancashire, for permission to take her son James out of class for the trip but the request was refused because it was not 'an exceptional circumstance' Sally Randall took her son James, 13, out of Norden High School, pictured, for a ten-day break during term time . 'The kids talk about that holiday every single week. His last wish has been granted, and they’ll always remember their grandad. It’s just a shame it’s ended like this.' Mr Mitchell said: 'We don’t think it’s appropriate to discuss the details of this individual case. 'The government’s guidelines on absence during term time changed in September last year. 'Head teachers should only authorise a leave of absence in exceptional circumstances. 'These are only considered if no other option is possible and an absence from school is necessary during the term.'","Sally Randall took son out of school to say goodbye to dying grandfather .

"By . Louise Cheer For Daily Mail Australia . For 20 years, Dave McGuire felt he was living the life of someone else while battling a crippling addiction that drove him to have sex every day with both men and women, and led to the eventual breakdown of his marriage. The former quantitative analyst - who worked on the Wall Street financial district in New York and then in the film industry - would visit sex clubs, peep shows, adult book stores and video arcades, massage parlours, watch pornography and people on the street to keep himself in a constantly aroused state. Mr McGuire's addiction started in his teenage years when he was asking his older peers to buy him pornography and his 20s and 30s it escalated and started impacting on his every day life. Scroll down for video . Dave McGuire battled an addiction with sex for more than 20 years but now he is helping other overcome their addictions . 'At the height of my addiction, I had to have sex daily,' Mr McGuire said. 'I was sexually compulsive not always with a partner...there was daily masturbation and pornography. 'After a while, it didn’t matter who I was acting out with [men or women], it was about getting the sexual charge. 'I would act out in groups of people as well as individuals. I would act out in book stores where they sold pornography or in clubs that were geared towards sexual behaviours like sex clubs.' 'When I was crossing the boundaries of my sexual orientation, it heightened the high of my addiction.' Like many who battle the addiction, Mr McGuire's obsession with sex grew from tragic circumstances. 'I feel like my addiction had its birth in my early teenage existence from sexual abuse,' he said. 'Not all born from that but many are. 'My abuse took place between ages 12 and 14 and it was with a parish priest. 'I was alter boy when it started and he was a friend of the family.' Mr McGuire believes his addiction to sex started when he was in his teenage years after he was sexually abuse by a priest . Years later the priest married he and his ex-wife when he was 23 years old. 'I was in deep denial about my abuse...this is how sick the priest was,' Mr McGuire said. But Mr McGuire was no stranger to addictions at that point. For years, he had also been battling substance and alcohol abuse, which only became obvious to him during his marriage. 'It took someone else's eyes to say to me: ""You have got to cut this out"",' Mr McGuire said. 'At 23 years old, I got sober from drugs and alcohol. 'But my sex addiction was still active, I didn’t know it was a sex addiction. 'I was still watching pornography daily and peep shows in Manhattan were a regular stop off for me after work, which escalated to me using massage parlours and sex workers and prostitutes. 'I got by in the day by saying ""At the end of the day, I could look forward to this"".' His clientele at The Cabin Chiang Mai includes celebrities, athletes, high-profile businessmen and politicians . Mr McGuire's denial of his sex addiction eventually led to his marriage break down three years later. He said he felt like he was living two separate lives. 'In the history of my sex addiction there wasn’t a lot of acting out with my wife,' Mr McGuire said. 'It was a complete disruption in our intimacy. 'I was showing up in the marriage and at work as if I was one person and behind it all I knew I was somebody else. 'So I could really not be connected with [my wife], I was pretending.' Mr McGuire darkest moments during his sex addiction would come after he 'acted out' his sexual compulsions. He recalls a time when his girlfriend at the time found a sex trade magazine in their apartment that was filled with escort advertisements and confronted him about it. 'It was terrible seeing the hurt on her face,' he said. 'She said: ""What the hell is this doing here? What is going on with you? Have you been lying to me all the time?"" 'I knew exactly what it was but I still tried to lie by saying: ""That must have been in the apartment before we even moved in"", because I had to stash it somewhere. 'But all she had to do was look at the date of publication on the magazine [to get the truth].' Mr McGuire finally had sought help when he 'ran out of options'. In the past, he had tried to 'cure' himself of his addiction by using techniques he took away from 12-step programs he had used to kick his substance and alcohol abuse. 'I was not able to stop under my own will power,' he said. 'Finally I was able to admit I was defeated that I needed more specialised help.' When he was younger Mr McGuire also battled addiction to a variety of substances . About 30-40 percent of the clientele who come through The Cabin are Australian, according to the US-born psychotherapist . 'I was living in a brothel and using drugs, and my girlfriend was a sex worker. I remember standing at the front of the brothel at the metal gates and I remember standing looking at people going off to work in the morning and I had this insight. 'I felt like I was imprisoned by addiction, stuck in this brothel and addicted to sex and drugs. 'Living in the brothel took place in the summer / fall of 2001. It was an unassuming house in Elmhurst, Queens. I lived there from around July thru September. 'You could say that when the New York World Trade Centre came down, so did the structure of any kind of life I had. It was shortly after 9-11 that my brother and sister intervened and I was flown from New York to Los Angeles by them to enter rehab. 'My drug addiction was multi-substance. I was addicted to alcohol, marijuana, painkillers (Vicodin), benzodiazepines (Xanax), Heroin (for a short period of time) but mostly I was smoking Freebase (crack) cocaine in the height of my drug and sex addiction.' And it was from this experience, Mr McGuire now helps those who have an addiction to sex. While trying to educate himself about how to heal himself, he went back to school to get his master's degree in psychology. He said more people needed to acknowledge sex was an addiction because then people would be more comfortable coming forward . After his life fell apart he went back to study to get his masters degree in psychology . 'I didn’t really at that time have a career as a psychologist or psychiatrist,' Mr McGuire said. 'In practicum, once I started working with people who needed help and actually saw the effect I was having and helping people be happier, something lit up inside me and the feedback I was getting, I thought ‘Maybe this was something I should be doing'. 'It made me feel like my dark past could be used for something good.' Mr McGuire is now a psychotherapist and sex addiction counsellor at a Thai rehabilitation facility, The Cabin Chiang Mai, where he treats celebrities, athletes, high-profile businessmen and politicians. He said 30 to 40 per cent of the clientele at the clinic were Australians. He said he still faces struggles to this day, but is much more aware of how to manage any addictive behaviour. 'Even if I am in a committed healthy relationship and if I am having sex more than four or five times a week I need to be careful. I need to gear the intimacy a bit so I’m not ramping up the addiction. 'For me, each person develops this with themselves, for me my bottom line is not paying for sex and having sex with people I have an level of intimacy with – so not having anonymous sex. He described his addiction to drug as multi-substance and used alcohol, marijuana, painkillers (Vicodin), benzodiazepines (Xanax), Heroin and Freebase (crack) cocaine . Mr McGuire urged people to get help if they believed they needed it and not to live with the discomfort of addiction . 'I’m not just using their body to get off on. For many people, porn is also completely off the table.' 'If any of my story resonates with you then by all means seek help,' Mr McGuire continued. 'If you or a loved one is showing any signs that the behaviour is becoming out of control then there is help available. 'Even if you are simply questioning the behaviour, we have assessment tools available to help answer the question. 'You don’t have to live with the discomfort your behaviour is causing you.' Mr McGuire said more people needed to acknowledge sex was an addiction because then people would be more comfortable coming forward. 'The longer society stays in denial over the severity of the issue, the longer people will suffer unnecessarily,' he said. 'In the same way that society was in denial over the sexual abuse problems we are now addressing, people were suffering in secrecy and now there are opportunities for healing available.'","Dave McGuire spent two decades needing to have sex every day of his life .

"By . Kate Lyons For Daily Mail Australia . Brooke always knew she wanted to be a performer. As a child she would sing into her hairbrush in front of the mirror, make music videos of her favourite songs with her two sisters and put on variety shows for visitors to the house. But growing up in the small mining town of Biloela in central Queensland, her dream never seemed like it could become reality. So after school Brooke, 25, who did not wish to give her surname, studied a Diploma of Beauty Therapy and began working at day spas. She enjoyed her work at first, but when she moved to Gladstone she decided it was time to pursue her passion and so she learnt how to DJ. 'I approached the manager of the local nightclub expressing my interest to learn how to DJ. He was nice enough to let me come in after my day job when the club was closed to use the club's decks and show me the basics… and eventually they let me stay back once the doors had opened and I DJed in front of a crowd for the first time,' she told Daily Mail Australia. Brooke transformed herself to become DJ Brooklyn when she realised her passion was DJing . DJ Brooklyn described herself as a 'shy quiet kid' and a 'country girl' who transforms into a fearless outgoing person when she is onstage . Since then, DJ Brooklyn, as she is now known, has become the resident DJ at Platinum Nightclub on the Gold Coast, toured at nightclubs around the country and performed shows in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia, as well as signing with an agency. DJ Brooklyn has transformed from a shy girl to a fearless performer who describes her sound as 'bounce and big room'. 'I was always the shy quiet kid, even now sitting in a group of friends I am probably the quietest one. It actually takes me a lot of time to feel comfortable around someone and open up,' she said. 'However, when I'm on stage, I'm very outgoing, confident and fearless. I can't really explain it, I have always been like that from my early dancing days.' Part of finding her confidence has come from finally doing something she loves. 'I used to get really nervous right before going into the booth, but once I play the first track I'm in my zone and the performer in me comes out,' she said. The 25-year-old has been touring nightclubs around the country and in Asia . DJ Brooklyn describes her sound as 'bounce and big room' Her dream is to  play at some of the world's biggest music festivals and to release some original tracks . Not everyone understands her unorthodox career path. 'My parents just thought it was a hobby at first, but once I started taking it seriously they seemed a bit worried. They would never stop me from going after what I love but I think they would prefer me to have a secure nine to five job,' she said. But the opportunities presented to her as a DJ have been too good to pass up. In May she performed in front of more than 2,000 people at the H-Artistry Globe Art Of Mixing event in Malaysia. 'It was a super clubbing experience with a massive stage, elevated DJ booth, dancers and an amazing light show. I felt very loved and welcomed over there,' she said. The DJ is looking forward to continuing to tour across Australia and has ambitions to release her own original track, perform on the main stage at some international festivals and to tour across the USA and Europe. The 25-year-old would visit a nightclub after work each day to learn the craft . Before she was a DJ, Brooke studied beauty therapy in Queensland .

"By . Sarah Dean For Daily Mail Australia . and Aap . Horses have been banned from marching in the World War I centenary ANZAC parade in Albany due to safety concerns. Equestrians are outraged the chair of the event's organising committee, Major General Dave Chalmers said the horses were not allowed in the march because of the risk to the anticipated 60,000 visitors. Major General Chalmers said the troop march was not a re-enactment and would be restricted to serving and ex-serving defence force members and cadets. The WA Australian Light Horse Association has been banned from the Albany, WA, ANZAC march . But the light horse would be recognised at other events in Albany over the ANZAC weekend, he said. Australian Light Horse Association WA president Harry Ball said it was disappointing the committee had not discussed their concerns with the association before banning the horses. Mr Ball said the horses had taken part in the Albany ANZAC march every year for the past 25 years as well as at events in Perth without causing an accident. 'If they'd just discussed with us the safety issues or maybe included us in planning for the day we could have reassured them,' Mr Ball said. Members of the Australian light horse association are seen here in the old city of Beersheva, Israel in 2007 . WA members have taken part in ANZAC marches for 25 years . Mr Ball said the association was told the risk of people slipping on horse droppings had contributed to the ban. Several talkback callers told Fairfax radio on Thursday that they would voluntarily pick up the droppings if it meant the horses could take part. Only one Australian horse from the 136,000 sent overseas during World War I made it back.","The Australian Light Horse Association have been banned from a WW1 ANZAC parade in Albany, WA .

"By . Margot Peppers for MailOnline . To many of us, Jennifer Aniston's iconic layered haircut in her role as Rachel Green on Friends is now synonymous with Nineties style - unless, of course, you're too young to to remember the show. That's exactly what 22-year-old singer Sky Ferreira realized after she shared a photo of herself with fans on Instagram, showing off her new haircut that resembled the character's famous 'do. But when she captioned the image 'The Rachel is Real', her young fans were left positively bewildered, with some leaving hilarious comments asking who in the world Rachel is. Get the reference? Singer Sky Ferreira shared a photo of her new 'The Rachel' haircut on Instagram (pictured), butshe was left feeling old when her young fans had no idea who she was talking about . Confused identity: Many of her 326,000-plus followers were left positively bewildered, with some leaving hilarious comments asking who in the world Rachel is . 'Who the f*** is she????' wrote one of her fans. 'Who is rachel?' demanded another. And perhaps the most hilarious response came from one of Sky's fans who seemed convinced she had solved the mystery. 'She means ratchet, d******,' she wrote confidently. Even Miley Cyrus's younger sister Noah, 14, was left bewildered by the reference. In another post, Sky shared a screenshot of a text sent to her from We Can't Stop singer. The screenshot shows how Miley texted the haircut photo to her sibling, and she responded: 'Who is rachel?' Iconic: Jennifer Aniston became so well known for her layered chop in her role as Rachel Green on Friends that the cut quickly came to be known as The Rachel .

Cracked it: Perhaps the most hilarious response came from one of Sky's fans who seemed convinced she had solved the mystery. 'She means ratchet, d******,' she wrote . The final episode of Friends aired in 2004, when Noah was just four years old, so his confusion is somewhat understandable. Still, for twenty-somethings who watched the series from start to finish and who can still quote episodes, the incident is undoubtedly a sad reminder of just how quickly time passes.

"By . Marielle Simon For Daily Mail Australia . John Coleman is used to having passers-by stop him on the street in 'little puddles of sentiment' commenting on how cute his 'puppy is', to which he replies, 'Tiger is not a puppy, he is three years old.' Almost approaching his fourth birthday, Tiger, is one of the rare German shepherd's with Dwarfism, a rare genetic disorder found in dogs when both parents carry the dwarf gene. Expert in German Shepherd breeding, Jodie Carroll, says the mutation is currently found in only 12 per cent of German Shepherd's world wide. Tiger, who is nearly four years old,  is a rare German Shepherd with Dwarfism . She says breeders should take the mutation seriously and test their studs for the gene. 'It's not cute - from my point of view it's quite distressing and very serious,' Ms Carroll told the Daily Mail Australia. 'They are suffering from a genetic mutation and suffer serious health problems.' Pituitary dwarfism syndrome in dogs occurs when puppies are born without a pituitary gland and unable to produce the correct amounts of growth and thyroid hormone. As a result of this mutation, puppies stop growing at an early age and face many health issues such as, shortened life span and problems with growing skin, teeth and adult fur. Dogs like Tiger, here with owner John Coleman, stop growing at an early age and face many health issues . The temperament of dwarfed dogs are typically aggressive and anxious , which make for undesirable pets, resulting in breeders usually being forced to euthanize a puppy born with dwarfism. Tiger's owner John Coleman told the Daily Mail Australia that to euthanize was never an option. Eight years ago Mr Coleman and his partner Nick had purchased a full grown German Shepherd from breeders Darien and Ken Northcote. It wasn't until five years later when Mr Coleman received a call from the Northcotes, telling him of their recent breed of genetically mutated German Shepherds and asking him if he would be willing to adopt a mutated dog with dwarfism. 'We did a pretty good job with our full grown dog, Lydia, so they [Northcotes] thought we would be the best people to take on Tiger,' he said. The temperament of dwarfed dogs are typically aggressive and anxious resulting in breeders usually being forced to euthanize a puppy born with dwarfism . 'The first thing we got from the breeders was a photo of him,' he said. 'A tiny little thing - it was too cute!' 'I didn't want something that ridiculously cute but my reaction was ""well what harm could it bring?""' Typically German Shepherds with dwarfism aren't genetically blessed with the same level of cuteness Tiger possesses. 'We actually won the lottery when it came to dwarfism,' Mr Coleman admitted. 'Ken and Darien specially chose for us the one who was the least obviously affected but we were prepared to have a pretty ugly, little dog.' John said the Northcotes were completely upfront and forthcoming with the challenges they would face having a dog with dwarfism. Typically German Shepherds with dwarfism aren't genetically blessed with the same level of cuteness Tiger possesses, seen here with the Coleman's other dog Lydia . 'We got him young enough that he could still bond with the people who matter and our big dog has a good nature so he [Tiger] never got hostile', he said. 'He wasn't over whelmed because there weren't too many of us.' John attempted taking Tiger to Obedience School, and without surprise, he failed to behave in a social setting, trying to attack the dogs and humans around. It wasn't until six months of having Tiger, when John and Nick  noticed his temperament changing from timid to full time aggression. 'He became even more aggressive,' he said. 'He is timid around everything, always jumpy and very nervous. When people come over we usually have to put a muzzle on him. Tiger (left with John) was bred by Darien and Ken Northcote (centre and right) has two brothers Arnie and Rocky who also has Dwarfism, and a sister Ruby (right) 'You think he is full of confidence but in fact it is quite the opposite - his reaction to everything around him is to frighten it away.' But behind closed doors and in the comfort of his home, Tiger shows his owners a more softer side. 'He is a lovely, affectionate playful little thing while he is at home with us.' When asked by the Daily Mail Australia on the thought of losing their beloved Tiger, John admits to a being conflicted. 'We can't put him into kennels or be dog-sitted because he is so aggressive so we can't take holidays away and he is quite a burden as far as having visitors goes.' But about 18 months ago Tiger suffered from an unexplained infection which caused him being rushed to hospital. 'My partner was in tears at the thought of losing him,' he said. 'We are very attached to him - we will miss him dreadfully but there will also be a sense of freedom being able to resume a normal life.' John said they can't get anyone to look after Tiger and have trouble when they have visitor as he is too aggressive .","Tiger, the three-year-old German shepherd with Dwarfism .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . If you've ever wanted to soar over Earth on the world's largest parachute, now is your chance – and you don't even have to leave your desk. This dizzying footage of Nasa's 'flying saucer' will take you 180,000ft (35 miles) into Earth's atmosphere as it travels four times faster than the speed of sound. The saucer, dubbed the Low Density Supersonic Decelerator (LDSD), is designed to someday deliver large payloads, such as vehicles, to Mars. Scroll down for video . The footage shows the June test conducted over Hawaii, which although successful, didn't go quite to plan with the parachute failing to unfurl properly. The goal of this flight test - the first of three planned for the project - was to determine if the balloon-launched, rocket-powered, design could reach the altitudes and airspeeds needed to test two new breakthrough technologies destined for future Mars missions. Carried as payload during the shakeout flight were two technologies scheduled to be tested next year aboard this same type of test vehicle. The Supersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator (SIAD) is a large, doughnut-shaped air brake that deployed during the flight, helping slow the vehicle from 3.8 to two times the speed of sound. Fire power: This image shows rockets burning on Nasa's Low-Density Supersonic Decelerator (LDSD) as the saucer-shaped test vehicle flies into near-space . Soaring high: The the balloon which carried LDSD into high altitudes can be seen here. The image was taken by the saucer-shaped test vehicle's high-resolution cameras. Nasa said the test of technology they hope to one day use on Mars achieved most of its objectives and taught them lessons for their next attempt . Moment of truth: The parachute is shown here unfurling on the right. The balloon on the left was used to pull the 200lb (90kg) parachute from its sturdy canister . The LDSD is unique in its design, using a donut-shaped inflatable decelerator to create atmospheric drag. When attached to the exterior of a capsule travelling at Mach 3.5 it will be capable of slowing it down to Mach 2, where a regular parachute can then deploy. To simulate the Martian atmosphere on Earth, the LDSD was lifted to a height of 80,000ft (35 miles) by a high-altitude balloon. A small rocket then launched it 11 miles (18km) higher. As this point the LDSD inflated around a larger saucer-shaped object, bringing it safely back to land in open water. The second, the Supersonic Disksail Parachute, is the largest supersonic parachute ever flown. It has more than double the area of the parachute which was used for the Mars Science Laboratory mission that carried the Curiosity rover to the surface of Mars. 'A good test is one where there are no surprises but a great test is one where you are able to learn new things, and that is certainly what we have in this case.' said Ian Clark, principal investigator for LDSD at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 'Our test vehicle performed as advertised. The SIAD and ballute (a combination between a balloon and parachute), which extracted the parachute, also performed beyond expectations. 'We also got significant insight into the fundamental physics of parachute inflation. 'We are literally re-writing the books on high-speed parachute operations, and we are doing it a year ahead of schedule.' 'As far as I am concerned, whenever you get to ride shotgun on a rocket-powered flying saucer, it is a good day,' said Mr Clark. 'We hope the video will show everyone how beautiful and awesome the test was, and to just to give folks an insight into what experimental flight test is all about.' Deflated: The test vehicle is seen here before (left) and after (right) the balloon that helped carry it to near-space was deflated. The plume left by the test vehicle's main engine can be seen in these images. Engineers arranged for the balloon to deflate and descend shortly after the rocket fired . Damaged: The Supersonic Disk Sail Parachute, one of the new technologies being developed as part of Nasa's Low-Density Supersonic Decelerator (LDSD) project, floats in the Pacific Ocean after the completion of its first flight test, on June 28. Tears are visible in the parachute, which did not unfurl as expected . Nasa officials were still pleased with the flight for the $150 million (£90 million) experiment, and said it was a pretty good test of technology that might one day be used to deliver heavy spacecraft - and eventually astronauts - to Mars. The space agency also hopes that the new craft could one day replace the same parachute design in use since the twin Viking spacecraft landed on the red planet in 1976. The launch over Hawaii was the first successful attempt after previous flights were marred by strong winds that could have blown the craft into no-fly zones. Technology needs to advance, or else humanity won't be able to fly beyond the International Space Station in low-Earth orbit, according to Michael Gazarik, head of space technology, at Nasa headquarters. 'Technology development 'is the surest path to Mars,' Mr Gazarik said. Back to Earth: The divers, from the U.S. Navy's Explosive Ordnance Disposal team, retrieved the huge LDSD vehicle just hours after the successful test in June . Big catch: Divers retrieve the test vehicle for Nasa Low-Density Supersonic Decelerator off the coast of the U.S. Navy's Pacific Missile Range in Kauai, Hawaii .","Footage shows a June test of LDSD conducted over Hawaii, which although successful, didn't go quite to plan .
