"Hull City will lead the chase to sign Darren Fletcher if the Scotland midfielder decides to leave Manchester United in January. Fletcher has become an increasingly peripheral figure at Old Trafford since he was appointed vice-captain by Louis van Gaal in the summer and started United’s first three games of the season. The 30-year-old has played less than half an hour of club football as a substitute since August, including a late appearance off he bench in last weekend’s win at Arsenal. Fletcher, who has salvaged his career after recovering from a chronic bowel condition, is out of contract in the summer and still hopes that he will be offered a one-year extension. Scottish midfielder Darren Fletcher could be set for a January move away from Manchester United . But the Scot accepts that first-team opportunities will be limited following the summer signings of Ander Herrera and Daley Blind, and he may have to leave Old Trafford where he has won five Premier League titles and the Champions League in a United career spanning 336 games. Hull boss Steve Bruce is a long-time admirer of Fletcher and it is understood the Premier League strugglers have already registered their interest in taking him to the KC Stadium in the January transfer window. However, Hull are likely to face competition from a number of other top-flight clubs if Fletcher decides to end his career away from United. Fletcher, up against Wayne Rooney with Scotland, has fallen out of favour for his national side too .

"English Heritage buildings are normally well known for their grandeur or historic importance - but one house has gained notoriety because it resembles TV comic Alan Carr. The 'Whitefriars Gatehouse', in Coventry, was recently being used as a  toy museum but closed in 2008 after the owner died and is now being sold by the city council. The Grade-II listed property, which dates back to the middle-ages and was once the gatehouse to a monastery, was ruined by a fire in 2009, but has since been renovated and was put up for sale  in 2010. This historic house in Coventry may date back to the middle-ages, but it has gained new fame - as a dead ringer for Chatty Man comedian Alan Carr . Despite its historical roots, it is best-know these days for its resemblance to Chatty Man host Carr, with the window frames resembling his glasses, and the black and white beam over the arch mimicking his toothy grin. The lookalike was first spotted by local resident Karl Abbott, 31, a computer engineer. He said: 'I was just passing it and out the corner of my eye I saw this building that looked familiar. 'I pulled over got out out the car and I thought - ""that looks just Alan Carr"". 'I took a picture and emailed it to my friends and work colleagues and everyone thought the same. 'He’s from not too far away from here in Northampton - I wonder if he’d be interested in buying it.' Another resident Jack Tailor, 53, added: 'It really has that big jolly and goofy look about it. I’ve heard of the houses that look Hitler but I’ve never seen one like Alan Carr before. 'Some say it looks more like Esther Rantzen, Luis Surarez or Ken Dodd - but I think it’s a dead ringer for the chatty man.' The property has also been likened to Esther Rantzen, Luis Surarez or Ken Dodd. Residents say the windows look like Carr's glasses, while the black and white beam over the arch resembles his toothy grin . The property was added to the English Heritage’s 'At Risk Register' earlier this month, which identifies vulnerable historic properties. The original gatehouse began as an entrance to Whitefriars monastery in the early 15th century when the new town wall blocked the original access. It was modified into a house in the middle of the 16th century after the monastery was dissolved and converted into a private house. Politician John Hales purchased the Whitefriars for £83 after it was dissolved and confiscated by Henry VIII. It is likely that he converted the stone screen into a gatehouse by erecting another sandstone wall at the rear and roofing over. Later additions were built in the 18th and 19th centuries and the wing that was almost totally destroyed by fire in June 2009 dates from this period. This house in Swansea became notorious three years ago after one resident noticed its similarity to German ruler Adolf Hitler .","Grade II listed building dates back to the middle ages and was once used as gatehouse for Whitefriars monastery .

"David Beckham earned over £20,000 per day last year, ten times as much as his wife Victoria . He may have hung up his football boots more than a year ago. But it seems David Beckham’s earning power is still as strong as ever. The former England captain, 39, picked up a £7.5million windfall from his company in the past year. Exploiting the image rights of ‘Brand Beckham’ earned the ex-midfielder the equivalent of £20,548 a day – ten times greater than the dividend picked up by wife Victoria, 40. The Spice Girl-turned-fashion designer paid herself £750,000 through her company Moody Productions, which channels earnings from her music back catalogue. But the pair still have a stratospheric joint worth of £210million – thanks to her fashion empire, which last year made a profit of £1.4million, and his lucrative promotional contracts with companies including Adidas, clothing chain H&M and Sky Sports. In the past 12 months, the former Manchester United star’s image rights company, Footwork Productions, made a turnover of £14.8million. Although the figure was a fall of around £1.7million on the year before, it still allowed the firm to post a post-tax profit of £9.6million on ‘Brand Beckham’. The retired footballer picked up the bulk of the sum, taking a £7.5million dividend. According to the director’s report: ‘The company’s principal activity during the year continued to be the exploitation of David Beckham’s name and image rights.’ Among his business deals, the ex-footballer sells his own branded fragrances through Coty Inc, has filmed adverts for Diageo’s Haig Club whisky, helped promote the Las Vegas Sands hotel and is a brand ambassador for both Sainsbury’s and Jaguar. He has famously posed in his underpants for fashion house Giorgio Armani – and earlier this year promoted H&M’s Bodywear range. Scroll down for video . But he hinted that his underwear modelling days are coming to an end, saying: ‘I’m getting older now, I’m not sure too many people want to see me parading around in my underwear much longer. My body’s still OK but it’s only going to be a matter of time before people are like, “Really? Again?” ‘I’m 39 years old, I’ve got four kids, I’m not sure people are comfortable with that any more.’ Mr Beckham has earned his fortunes thanks to lucrative promotional contracts with companies including Adidas, clothing chain H&M and Sky Sports . Beckham, who also played for Real Madrid during his football career, earned a £1.95million-a-year base salary with US club LA Galaxy in 2012. He retired from the sport in May last year after five months at French club Paris Saint-Germain – where he donated his £170,000-a-week salary to a children’s charity. The Beckhams are now based in London, where former Posh Spice Victoria has just opened a clothes store. After a reported £5million on renovations, they are moving into a £30million West London home with children Brooklyn, 15, Romeo, 12, Cruz, nine, and three-year-old Harper.","David Beckham picked up a £7.5million windfall from his company last year .

"Lachlan Mullen was fit and healthy like most 20-year-old men his age but in 2012, he got the shock of his life when he was diagnosed with lung cancer. Within months of diagnosis, he was so weak he was unable to stand up long enough to have a shower because of his chemotherapy treatment. But eventually, a drug changed all that and now Mr Mullen is helping the fight to make other 'life-changing' drugs more readily available to other Australians through a Rare Cancers Australia campaign. Lachlan Mullen was 20 when he was diagnosed with lung cancer . Mr Mullen's experience with cancer started with a cough. Six months later - when it did not go away - he went to see a doctor and got a chest X-ray. Mr Mullen's doctor discovered a tumour growing in his lung and the 20-year-old said he went into 'absolute shock' when he heard the news. 'I was an electrical apprentice, I was a young fit guy and as far as I thought I was perfectly healthy,' he told Daily Mail Australia. During his chemotherapy, Mr Mullen was so weak he could barely walk . 'I worked 45 hours a week and would go to the gym every day and I pretty much felt invincible.' Mr Mullen said it took about a week for the reality of his situation to sink in but then he came to a crossroads. 'I said to myself: ""You can sit around and feel sorry for yourself or you can do everything you can to beat it"",' he told Daily Mail Australia. Mr Mullen - who is now 22 - chose the latter and it was not an easy task. He started on chemotherapy two months later but by his third cycle he started to struggle. 'I struggled with it and I was hospitalised for a week,' Mr Mullen said. 'I felt my body had shut down, I had to sit in a chair to have a shower because I couldn't stand up long enough to have a shower.' The now 22-year-old (pictured) had the opportunity to be treated with a 'life-changing' drug worth $90,000 for free . Eventually they took him off chemotherapy when his oncologist found out the Adelaide man had a rare anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutation, which meant his cancer could be treated with a different method. Mr Mullen's oncologist organised for him to be put on Crizotinib, which was a $90,000 drug that was not available in Australia in 2013. Luckily for him, Mr Mullen did not have to pay for the drug as his specialist appealed for the treatment on 'compassionate grounds'. But before he could start treatment, Mr Mullen had to jump two last hurdles - having a brain tumour removed and heart surgery to drain fluid from around the organ. When he eventually started taking Crizotinib, the young man said he felt better within a couple of weeks. 'I put on weight, I started walking again and within a month or two I was going back to gym and jogging. Before I knew it I was running again,' Mr Mullen said. 'I met up with mates in Europe for three weeks and really started to get my quality of life back – feeling like a 21-year-old again.' Mr Mullen (back, second from left) said he had a better quality of life on the drug and was helping the fight to make it more readily available to others . Mr Mullen said the drug gave him a better quality of life and he wanted others to benefit from it. So he has teamed up with Rare Cancers Australia to fight for better access to medicines. The Sick or Treat campaign aims to help Australians get the best cancer care available. It wants 'empower those patients needing costly medicines with the platform to raise money via online campaigns', according tothe campaign's website. '[Crizotinib] changed my life and people who have been through what I have, I want to help them,' Mr Mullen said. 'If it was six months later, I would have had to pay $90,000. 'It gave me a better quality of life and more time to find the treatment I needed.' Even though Mr Mullen stopped responding to Crizotinib after six months, he said it gave him a seven-to-eight-month window to find other treatments. Now he is part of a clinical trial for another ALK inhibitor, Alectinib, which has returned his life 'back to normal'. Mr Mullen has returned to full-time study at university, last month he participated in 12km bay run and he goes boxing five times a week. And next year he hopes to return to the football field.","Lachlan Mullen was 20 when he was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2012 .

"His pal Ryan Reynolds is busy preparing to welcome his first baby with Blake Lively so Gerard Butler has taken over the helm at Hugo Boss. The Scottish actor has replaced Ryan as the face of Hugo Boss' new male scent and he proves his worth in a dapper campaign shoot. The 44-year old is promoting the new Boss Bottled Collector's Edition, which aims to promote the ‘Man of Today’ - a gentleman who defines his own success rather than allowing success to define him. New face: Gerard Butler has taken over from Ryan Reynolds as the face of Hugo Boss perfumes and looks suited and booted in the new campaign imagery . The brand snapped up the A-list actor because, they say, he is passionate yet real; gritty but refined; in touch with emotions, and compassionate while driven. Speaking in a behind the scenes video, Gerard opens up about those values and how he stays true to himself in the fast-paced world of showbiz. 'To stay true to those values I have is as important as life itself,' he said. 'It's all part of growing up and maturing and learning how to be a man and how to grow up and what it means to be a knight and a gentleman.' Dapper: In a behind the scenes video, Gerard can be seen filming the new commercial for the brand's Christmas scent . Hand-picked: Hugo Boss snapped up Gerard because, they say, he is passionate yet real; gritty but refined; in touch with emotions, and compassionate while driven . A trained lawyer, Butler broke into acting in the mid 90s thanks to minor roles in James Bond's Tomorrow Never Dies, among others. Since then, his career has gone from strength to strength and career highlights include landing the lead in Joel Schumacher's The Phantom of the Opera, as well as roles in The Bounty Hunty and P.S. I Love You (and who could forget those abs in his portrayal of King Leonidas in 300?). 'Once I set something down for myself, if it's in life or a job or a movie, I've got to reach it,' he said about his success and ambition. 'It's setting something up that you've got to move towards because otherwise it just feels like a very nebulous idea.' Focussed: Speaking in the behind the scenes video, he explained that once he sets something down for himself, if it's in life or a job or a movie, he's got to reach it . But first, let me take a selfie: Gerard took time out on set to have a quick snap with a female fan . Butler, who recently returned from a holiday with a mystery brunette, also explains how he manages to balance his work/life schedule. 'Work/life balance is very, very important mainly because there were times in my life when there was too much life and there's been times when there's been too much work,' he said. 'I think we all need our sacred space. A man has to have his time alone to gather his thoughts. It's what this campaign is - a time alone to sit and assess and understand who we are and what is our purpose.' He may be 44 but Gerard's future is looking bright - he recently wrapped up filming the Gods of Egypt with The Face contestant Yaya Deng. 'This is the most exciting period of my life; I'm relaxed about everything. I believe everything is going to pan out exactly the way that it should be; it's that acceptance,' he said. 'It's more the spiritual side of life, I think when you get to this age you start going ""it's not how much money you can make, it's how you can develop as a being"" - that would be over the next five years. 'Over the next fifteen years, I'll probably just try to stay alive,' he joked. Remember this? Butler portrayed Leonidas, the king of Sparta who, along with 300 soldiers, battles to prevent the  Persian army from invading all of Greece in  action drama  300 in 2007 .

"Superscrimpers host Heather McGregor said clothes shopping is the biggest vice on which women waste their cash . Any woman searching for a solution to her financial woes need look no further than her own wardrobe, according to a financial expert. Heather McGregor – better known as television's Mrs Moneypenny – said clothes shopping is the biggest vice on which women waste their cash. She recommended going on a 'clothes diet' for six months, under which fashion purchases are banned. The host of Channel 4 show Superscrimpers also advises women to hold Boden parties, use what's already in their larder and ditch all household cleaning products for basic bicarbonate of soda. Mrs McGregor, 52, opened up about her money-saving tips at Henley Literary Festival, supported by the Daily Mail. She said: 'I suggest to people that they go on a clothes diet. It's just like being on a normal diet. Because what women fritter away money on actually is clothes. 'Basically you walk past a clothes shop and you think I can't go in there because I'm on a clothes diet. I made a few rules for myself – it didn't include underwear or tights. You genuinely notice what you might have bought just because it was there rather than [because it was] what you need. Now I'm much better about buying just stuff I need.' Mrs McGregor, a mother-of-three, who also runs a headhunting company and writes a weekly column in the Financial Times, also said hosting Boden parties – the middle-class equivalent of Avon parties – not only provided her with extra cash but free clothes for her children. She said: 'Boden sent scented candles, they sent the coffee. I earned £700 commission that day. And you either have a cheque for £700 or I could have one and a half times that in credit. I dressed my children for free for 18 months just by tidying up a bit, clearing up my house and putting on Johnny Boden's posh coffee.' To avoid overspending on food, always have a list and never go to the supermarket hungry, she said. She added: 'We audited someone's larder once and found £1,000 worth of stuff in it. I write a shopping list, then I go into the larder and see which of the things on the list I already have and cross it all off.' Mrs Moneypenny advised going on a 'clothes diet' for six months where fashion purchases are banned . Mrs McGregor, who was promoting her latest book, Mrs Moneypenny's Financial Advice for Independent Women, said it was important women did not hand responsibility for their finances to men. Instead they should spend an hour a week writing down every aspect of their spending – from credit cards, to mortgages, to phone bills. She said too many women relied on men – their father, husband or bank manager – to control their finances, adding: 'It's about taking back that information.'","Heather McGregor recommends going on a 'clothes diet' for six months .

"Virgin Atlantic is scrapping its Little Red domestic service next year – just two years after it was launched. The British airline said on Monday that Little Red’s short-haul flights between London Heathrow and Manchester, Edinburgh and Aberdeen will end because the subsidiary was not making a ‘positive contribution’ to the company. The Crawley-based carrier, co-owned by Sir Richard Branson and Delta Air Lines, said the decision followed a review of its network which has put a new emphasis on its transatlantic routes. Sir Richard Branson flashed his underpants when Little Red's inaugural flight arrived in Edinburgh in 2013 . Little Red will stop flying between London Heathrow and Manchester in March while its flights between Heathrow and Edinburgh and Aberdeen will stop in September. It was set up to act as a feeder to Virgin’s transatlantic and international routes, but the airline said it did not provide enough traffic. Virgin Atlantic chief executive Craig Kreeger blamed the subsidiary’s demise on the ‘inadequate’ number of runway slots made available by regulators. He said: ‘While this challenged environment meant Little Red ultimately did not deliver the results we had hoped, this certainly will not dampen our enthusiasm to try new things in the future.’ The airline also announced that it is on track to make a profit by the end of 2014 after two years of losses. Grounded: Little Red will stop flying between London and Manchester, Edinburgh and Aberdeen next year . Little Red launched in March 2013 after Virgin acquired Heathrow runway slots that became available after arch rival British Airways’ acquisition of short-haul carrier bmi. It operates single-class flights with Airbus A320 aircraft wet leased from Aer Lingus . Mr Branson famously lifted his kilt and flashed his underpants when the inaugural flight arrived in Edinburgh from London that month. Monday’s announcement comes less than a week after Willie Walsh, chief executive of British Airways’ parent company International Airlines Group, reignited his feud with Mr Branson. Mr Walsh called Little Red a ‘mistake’ and told the Telegraph that he is ‘delighted’ that the domestic airline is struggling to fill its flights.","Little Red operates between London and Manchester, Edinburgh, Aberdeen .

"Having a general anaesthetic before an operation can cause long-term memory loss because the drugs used may trigger a persistent reaction in the brain. A new Canadian study suggests memory cells which should be blocked as a temporary measure to facilitate surgery may never recover. Until now, scientists have not understood why about a third of patients who undergo anaesthesia and surgery experience some kind of cognitive impairment - including confusion and poor brain functioning - during the days following the operation. Having a general anaesthetic before an operation can cause long-term memory loss because the drugs used may trigger a persistent reaction in the brain, claim researchers (File picture) Post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) after a general anaesthetic is a short-lived phenomenon for most, although recent research suggests some POCD sufferers have a higher risk of developing dementia. However, one-tenth of patients still suffer cognitive impairments three months later and many relatives complain their loved ones were ‘never quite the same’ after a major operation. Previous experimental studies suggest some anaesthetic drugs can promote inflammation of brain tissue in a way that is characteristic of dementia. Another theory is that insufficient oxygen to the brain may have an effect in vulnerable patients. But the latest study suggests another mechanism involving memory-loss receptors in the brain, which are activated by anaesthetic drugs to ensure patients don’t remember traumatic events during surgery. Professor Beverley Orser and her team at the University of Toronto’s Faculty of Medicine found the activity of memory loss receptors remains high long after the drugs have been eliminated from the patient’s body. Animal studies showed this chain reaction has long-term effects on the performance of memory-related tasks. Professor Orser, an anaesthesiologist at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, said: ‘Patients - and even many doctors - think anaesthetics don’t have long-term consequences. A third of patients who undergo anaesthesia experience some cognitive impairment - including confusion and poor brain function - following an operation . ‘Our research shows that our fundamental assumption about how these drugs work is wrong.’ In the study led by researcher Agnes Zurek the team gave healthy male mice a low dose of anaesthetic for just 20 minutes. The results showed receptor activity remained at higher levels a week later, even when memory performance had been restored in the animals. The findings suggest a ‘previously unrecognised long-term effect’ on the memory loss receptors. There appear to be compensatory changes in the brain that can circumvent the problem, according to a report published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation. The team is now looking at drugs that can stop the continuing impact on the receptors and restore memory loss. While they are still in the early stages of research, some of the drugs show very promising results in animal studies, it is claimed. However, Professor Orser said the results suggest a patient’s learning and memory can be severely impaired during a time when they are receiving critical information about their care. Post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) after a general anaesthetic is a short-lived phenomenon for most, although recent research suggests some POCD sufferers have a higher risk of developing dementia. (Pictured, brain scans of an Alzheimer's patient) ‘There’s a lot going on after surgery, which can alter our ability to think clearly. Loss of sleep, new environments and medications can all impact a patient’s mental function. Anaesthetics likely compound these issues,’ said Professor Orser. She recommends doctors and family members carefully monitor patients after surgery for any signs of memory loss. She said: ‘Patients should write everything down or have a second pair of ears with them after surgery. 'For high-risk groups, physicians need to inform patients about these possible side effects and help manage the impact on recovery and overall health.’ The likelihood of a patient experiencing cognitive impairment depends on their age, health, type of surgery and the anaesthetic, with chances increasing for more intricate procedures. The incidence is highest in the elderly or those undergoing major surgery such as cardiopulmonary bypass. Prof Orser warned: ‘Anaesthetics don’t put you to sleep - they induce a pharmacological coma. We shouldn’t take these drugs lightly.’","Canadian study found a general anaesthetic can cause long-term memory loss because drugs trigger a persistent reaction in the brain .

"A gang of Romanian beggars sleeping rough on one of London's most exclusive streets  today demanded: 'We're EU citizens, give us houses'. The 40-strong group sleeping in a subway under Park Lane have been accused of turning it into a 'slum' having lived in various camps near Marble Arch for 18 months. Local businesses believe they have driven away customers because of the mess and members of the group urinating in the street and fighting with rivals. Today the group said they are willing to pack up their cardboard boxes if Westminster Council found them homes. Scroll down for video . Demand: Romanian migrants have been camping in a subway in Park Lane and one member has demanded homes because they are EU citizens . Clear up:  Westminster City Council has said the problems on Park Lane has cost taxpayers £500,000 a year . Detritus: Mattresses abd other items used by the camp are dumped on the pavement close to the Marble Arch subway . One middle-aged Eastern European woman, who refused to give her name, told the Evening Standard: 'We are from Romania. We are in the European Union. We need help with a house. Give us a house and we won't be here.' EU migrants can claim a council house in certain circumstances. Westminster Council says the problem of these Park Lane camps has cost the taxpayer £500,000 a year. They have campaigned to evict the rough sleepers — even buying them tickets to fly home — but some just come back. Gangs of immigrants have persistently been bedding down in Hyde Park and next to Marble Arch on Park Lane. These gangs are being blamed for crime and anti-social behaviour including pickpocketing, cashpoint fraud and street scams. In August out of 37 homeless people screened at Marble Arch just two were put on flights home - with one going voluntarily due to ill health - on £200 flights paid for by the taxpayer. Rough sleepers can regularly be seen camping out in front of expensive shops on adjoining Park Lane and close to the plush Dorchester Hotel where rooms start at around £550 a night and rise to over £7,000 for a suite. In May this year a penthouse flat at One Hyde Park - a short walk from the camp - sold for a reported £140m. Complaints from local residents and businesses include reports of Eastern European gangs begging, washing in fountains, dumping rubbish and defecating in public. Hakan Altay, owner of this Park Lane hair salon, says the camp needs to go because it is costing him 'tens of thousands' Problems: Police have moved members of the gangs on and even given them free flights home but they still return . Gangs of immigrants have persistently been bedding down in Hyde Park and next to Marble Arch on Park Lane. Raid: Police have broken up camps near Marble Arch on several occasions and the latest group is sleeping rough in an underpass . Map shows location of the upmarket area in central London where mainly Romanian nationals have been sleeping rough . People living near them say their streets are becoming 'open sewers' and claim they are having to bleach pavements outside their homes and shops because of the dirt. Park Lane hair salon owner Hakan Altay says the camp needs to go because it is costing him 'tens of thousands'. He told the Standard: 'My business has been killed by them. When I ask them to leave, they just shout. They don't understand. They sleep outside the shop and make my property smell of urine. They go to the toilet where they like.' Cllr Nickie Aiken, Westminster City Council cabinet member for community protection: 'I want to stress that the council and its partners go to great lengths to support those in genuine need and help them with a route away from rough sleeping. 'Home Office Immigration already has the power to send home any EU nationals not exercising their EU Treaty rights, and the council will continue to work with the Home Office and Metropolitan Police to ensure that this happens. 'The council is well aware of the anti-social behaviour in this area and the daily impact it has on residents and businesses. Cleaning up costs local Westminster's tax-payers approximately £500,000 every year - but the long-term solution doesn't lie with the council. The fact remains that the current legislative powers available do not go far enough and still allow some EU nationals to exploit a three-month window to stay here without making a positive contribution to London life. We need tighter regulations.'","Gang accused of turning areas of exclusive London street into a 'slum'

"'Can't expect protection': Celebrities like Oscar-winner Jennifer Lawrence (above) who had naked pictures leaked online by hackers have been branded 'dumb' by the EU's new digital head for having taken the images in the first place . The European Union's new digital head has accused celebrities whose naked photos have been leaked online of being 'dumb' for having taken them in the first place. Images of more than 80 stars including Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence, singer Rihanna and reality queen Kim Kardashian were stolen and posted online a month ago by mystery hackers. The images, which were taken on the stars’ mobile phones, appear to have been obtained by accessing private accounts on the ‘cloud’. Gunther Oettinger, who will become the European Commissioner for digital economy and society next month, today refused to apologise after saying that what had occurred was the fault of celebrities for having nude photos. ‘Stupidity is something you can only partly save people from,’ he told MEPs at a meeting on Monday. The German politician said: ‘The fact that recently there have been an increasing number of public lamentations about nude photos of celebrities who took selfies – I just can't believe it. ‘If someone is dumb enough as a celebrity to take a nude photo of themselves and put it online, they surely can't expect us to protect them.’ When asked to clarify his comments, Mr Oettinger told the BBC: ‘Everybody has a right to privacy. 'The EU Commission wants to make cloud computing safer.’ Asked if he would like to apologise for his comments, his spokeswoman said: ‘No.’ Appalled critics said that while the images were technically online, they were in fact kept private. The images were stolen from private cloud accounts belonging to the celebrities. A German MEP, Julia Reda from the Pirate Party, said of Mr Oettinger’s comments: ‘The statement is unbelievable. ‘The person applying to be in charge of shoring up trust in the internet so that Europeans do more business online just blamed people whose personal data was accessed and spread without authorisation. ‘He placed the moral blame for that crime squarely on the victims rather than the perpetrators.’ She added: 'By making a mockery of what he should recognise as a serious problem and by doing it in this aloof and insulting tone, Günther Oettinger is seriously calling into question whether he is qualified for the job of shaping our digital society for the next five years.’ The German magazine joined the attack on the commissioner, saying the comments demonstrated that he had ‘no clue about current events and issues at the core of his new resort’. Meanwhile, Google is being threatened with a £60million lawsuit from female celebrities for allegedly profiting from the biggest nude photo-hacking scandal in history. Scroll down for video . Gunther Oettinger (left), who will become the European Commissioner for digital economy and society next month, refused to apologise for saying that the leaked images were the fault of celebrities like Rihanna (right) The search giant has been accused of failing to remove the private images and ‘making millions from the victimization of women’, according to a legal letter obtained by the New York Post. Top Hollywood lawyer Marty Singer, said to be representing 12 of the women whose privacy was invaded, has now reportedly written to Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin as well as executive chairman Eric Schmidt accusing them of ‘blatantly unethical behaviour’. He claims Google has failed ‘to act expeditiously and responsibly to remove the images, but in knowingly accommodating, facilitating, and perpetuating the unlawful conduct. Google is making millions and profiting from the victimization of women’. Mr Singer claimed his law firm, Lavely & Singer, first sent notice to Google a month ago demanding the images were removed but many remain on sites like YouTube and BlogSpot. Two topless pictures of Rihanna and as many as 50 nude snaps of Johnny Depp’s fiancé Amber Heard were reportedly among those leaked online. Naked photos of Kim Kardashian, Vanessa Hudgens, Kate Bosworth and soccer star Hope Solo were also among those hacked last month. Speaking recently on ITV’s This Morning, actress Cameron Diaz – who was not hacked – was convinced the perpetrators would be punished. 'Whoever has done it, they will be caught and made examples of,’ she said. ‘This can happen to anyone. If these guys can do it to this group of people then everyone's vulnerable to it. 'I think that people really need to look at... how would they feel if it happened to them?'","Stolen images of more than 80 stars were posted online by mystery hackers .

In the last two years, more stringent border controls have led to the seizure of almost 3.3 billion cigarettes and more than 800 tonnes of dodgy tobacco - leading to 593 successful prosecutions.

"Mr Mitchell appeared on This Morning talking about his return to the radio after his battle with alcohol . For former BBC and ITN newsreader Ed Mitchell, alcohol is now something he associates with pain. His fall from grace as a well-known newsreader, interviewing world leaders and working alongside Alastair Stewart and the late Carol Barnes, was a  public one. At his peak he earned a salary of around £100,000, but ended up being sacked, declared bankrupt and forced to sleep rough. But now he has started to rebuild his life - marrying the woman who he calls his 'golden soul' who brought him tea when he slept on a park bench, and returning to the airwaves after more than a decade. The 61-year-old has secured a regular weekday slot on Share Radio, where he will be giving tips about banking and budgeting. He had worked as a newsreader for 35 years, and in his 1980s heyday worked for ITN. But he later struggled with alcoholism, leading to a decline that saw him struggling to leave the house at 7am without drinking wine first. Appearing on This Morning he said: 'I very stubbornly thought I could carry on, that I could function as an alcoholic but it did actually break me.' He admits at one point he felt like the alcohol had taken hold when he was sacked from CNBC. He said: 'It's never a good idea to tell an editor that he can't run a television station and I thought then that things were getting bad. 'I think also the awful dreadful torture of the night sweats and knowing that to commute to my job I was already having to drink half a bottle of wine just to get out onto the streets and head for the station. 'That's a bit of a warning sign that it has got a grip.' He said his wife at the time, Judy, tried hard to make him stop and his children told him to get a grip. Mr Stewart was sacked by CNBC in 2000 and got divorced from his wife of 25 years in 2006. A year later he was sleeping rough in East Sussex for four months. He said he had almost lived with an optimistic view, that something in life would turn up. Ed Mitchell was left living on a bench in Hove in East Sussex in 2007 after declaring himself bankrupt . But he added: 'I always thought friends would help me out, but what friends want an alcoholic sleeping on their sofa? I can understand that.' Mr Mitchell ended up with debts of a quarter of a million and later had to be declared bankrupt - something he said people should be aware of the risk of. He added: 'It's only a matter of few wage slips and if you allow debt to creep up it can wreck lives, and it isn't that far away from any of us.' In his heyday Mr Mitchell (right) was working with Alistair Stewart and the late Carol Barnes, pictured in 1988 . Mr Mitchell went to The Priory for treatment for his alcoholism after he appeared in a documentary in 2008 . At one stage Mr Mitchell had 25 credit cards with limits of £15,000 and used one to pay the other for 15 years until his interest escalated to £4,000 a month, according to The People. While he was sleeping rough Mr Mitchell met Mandy, who brought him cups of tea and sandwiches. He calls her his lifeline. Eventually the pair started up a romance. And in 2008 he appeared in a documentary about his struggle made by his former colleague, the late Carol Barnes. A man who he had previously interviewed saw the show and offered to pay for Mr Mitchell to be treated at the Priory. Mr Mitchell married Mandy Tines in 2012, after he said she was his 'lifeline' when he met her while homeless . Mr Mitchell is pictured with his son Freddie and daughter Alex following his recovery for his alcohol addiction . After three years he had problems with alcohol again, but after four months he returned to rehab. He has not drank since and married Mandy in 2012. He added: 'I actually got to the point where the first mouthful was thrill but subsequently I know it's going to cause all manner of problems. I now associate alcohol with pain.' Mr Mitchell will now present his radio show from 1pm until 5pm from Monday to Friday, and said it was 'absolutely wonderful to be back' as having a job made him feel he had meaning. Mrs Mitchell also appeared on the This Morning programme to wish her husband good luck and said 'I always knew that you had something special.'","Ed Mitchell had 30 year career as newsreader on ITN, BBC and CNBC .

"A seven-year-old girl has shaved off all her beautiful red hair to show her support for young children suffering from cancer – including her little sister. Hannah Gorsegner from Middletown, New Jersey, took the brave decision because she wanted to show her support for five-year-old sister, Natalie, who was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in August 2012 and is now in remission. Hannah, who said the day her sister was diagnosed was ‘the worst day of her life’, announced her decision to shave her head during an appearance on the Today show last month. Hannah Gorsegner from Middletown, New Jersey, shaved off all her beautiful red hair to show her support for young children suffering from cancer – including her little sister Natalie, center . Proud mom: Andrea Verdone Gorsegner congratulates her brave daughter after she has had all her hair shaved off . ‘I'm going to shave my head,’ she said. ‘This is one of the ways I can help kids with cancer and inspire them to be brave.’ The shaving took place last Wednesday during a Shave For A Cure event held by the Arms Wide Open Childhood Cancer Foundation at the New York Stock Exchange. The two sisters wore matching dresses to the event. As Hannah climbed up on a stool for her shaving, mom Andrea Verdone Gorsegner gave her a kiss and dad Dan Gorsegner stroked his daughter's long red hair one last time. Hannah's parents were emotional as they looked on while their daughter had been beautiful hair removed . Sister Natalie even got to join in and at one point used the clippers to shave her giggling sister’s head. After Hannah’s head was completely shaved, she had glitter poured on over freshly bald head while the entire floor of the stock exchange  applauded. She wasn't the only person to have her head saved that day and the others included several little boys and several businessmen who were supporting the cause. The event raised over $350,000 for childhood cancer, and Hannah donated her red hair to wigs for kids. ‘I hope that someone's going to be wearing my hair and that they're going to feel happy about it.’ she told Today. Hannah, left, and her sister Natalie, center, are joined by four businessmen from Merrill Lynch who agreed to help take the brave seven-year-old back to school . Hannah received a round of applause from her classmates who came up to rub her head . Proud father Dan Gorsegner had previously revealed that Hannah came up with idea to shave her head on her own, after watching Natalie lose her hair due to chemotherapy treatments. 'Andrea and I weren't very excited about it at first,' he said, describing the initial discussion he had with his wife. 'But Andrea and I talked a lot about it and when Hannah came up with the idea and she was very persistent about it, and obviously very passionate about it, it's obviously very difficult as a parent to say no to your kid when they feel so strongly about something.' Hannah’s parents had been concerned about how their daughter might we treated at school, but they needn't have worried. Their daughter was escorted to school by four businessmen from Merrill Lynch who had also had their heads shaved. Hannah, left, took the brave decision to shave her head because she wanted to show her support for five-year-old sister, Natalie, right, who was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in August 2012 and is now in remission . In fact Hannah received a round of applause from her classmates who came up to rub her head. Meanwhile the businessmen explained to the class that she was their hero after what she had done. ‘I don't want them to feel alone in this fight,’ she said. ‘I'm right by their side.’ Hannah's mom shares her daughter's generous spirit, and has already raised more than $136,000 for pediatric cancer research through her organization Infinite Love for Natalie Grace.

"Federal health officials are drafting new protocols on Ebola, after facing criticism over the insufficient guidelines that led two nurses to contract the deadly virus while treating U.S. patient zero Thomas Eric Duncan. Revised guidance for health care workers treating Ebola patients will include using protective gear 'with no skin showing,' a top federal health official said Sunday. Dr Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said those caring for an Ebola patient in Dallas were left vulnerable because some of their skin was exposed. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is working on revisions to safety protocols. Scroll down for videos . New rules: Dr Anthony Fauci of the national Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases announced new guidelines for treating Ebola on Sunday. Pictured above testifying before Congress on October 16 . New uniform: Dr Fauci says health care workers will now be outfitted hazmat suits when dealing with any future cases of Ebola in America. A medical worker in protective gear pictured at New York's Bellevue Hospital above . Ebola's incubation period is 21 days, and Dr Fauci noted that mark was reached on Sunday for Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital workers who first treated Thomas Eric Duncan, the Liberian man who later died of the disease. 'The ones now today that are going to be 'off the hook' are the ones that saw him initially in the emergency room,' Dr Fauci said. Duncan was seen at the hospital on September 26 and sent home with antibiotics. He returned by ambulance two days later, was admitted and died of Ebola on October 8. Judge Clay Jenkins, the chief executive in Dallas County, said that the protective order that has kept Duncan's family isolated expires Sunday at midnight. 'That's going to be a good thing for those families. They've been through so much, and we're very happy about that,' Jenkins said. But, Jenkins continued: 'At the same time, we're extremely concerned about these health care workers and we continue to make contingency in the event that there are more cases.' End of quarantine: Thomas Eric Duncan (pictured) was the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola on U.S. soil. He died from the disease on October 8. His family has been in quarantine for 21 days, and are set to be released from that isolation Sunday at midnight . Infected: Nurses Nina Pham, 26 (left), and Amber Vinson, 29 (right), were diagnosed with Ebola after treating Mr Duncan. Dr Fauci says health care workers at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital were left vulnerable to infection by protective clothing that left some of their skin exposed . Jenkins called the 75 health workers who cared for Duncan 'hometown health care heroes,' and said they had signed agreements with the state's public health commissioner to stay off public transportation. He said if any other health workers test positive for Ebola, a plan is in place that includes: . Fauci appeared on ABC's 'This Week,' NBC's 'Meet the Press,' ''Fox News Sunday' and CNN's 'State of the Union.' Jenkins was on ABC.","On Sunday, Dr Anthony Fauci announced new protocols for treating any future Ebola cases in the U.S.

"Two-thirds of Australian fathers would think twice before approaching a child in distress in public over fears they would be labelled a predator, new research shows. The survey conducted to coincide with the launch of Skynanny.net, a GPS tracking device for children, found that 45 percent of fathers said they would be reluctant to help a child, unless the child was in great distress and action was needed. And 23 percent of dads would not help lost children under any circumstance. Parenting researcher Dr Justin Coulson said this reaction was common. Skynanny.net inventor Jason Petch (pictured), who was abducted as a six year old, said he was inspired to create the device after he lost his daughter Lucy (pictured) at the beach when she was two . Skynanny (pictured) is carried on the child and links to the Skynanny.net app, which can be downloaded to any iPhone or Android smartphone.It provides distance and direction information for users to quickly locate their child, and it alerts the user if a child moves outside of their designated boundary . 'A lot of men I've spoken to in parenting groups, in conversation and in counselling have told me they do prefer to stay away from other children because they're worried about what they'd be accused of,' Dr Coulson said. 'They're recognising that men are by far and away statically more likely to be abusers. 'And they're recognising they would prefer to avoid any situation that would compromise people's perceptions of their integrity.' Dr Sue Packer, vice chair of the board of the National Association for Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect, said child molesters had become 'the 21st Century bogeyman'. The launch of the device coincides with a survey that has found two thirds of Aussie dads would think twice before approaching a child in distress in fear of being labelled a predator. Parenting researcher Dr Justin Coulson (pictured) said this reaction was common . 'Everybody is potentially a child molester and we treat people like they are,' Dr Packer said. 'It's almost been a generalised response to no trust men which is a huge problem in many ways.' Skynanny.net inventor Jason Petch, who was abducted as a six year old, said he was inspired to create the device after he lost his daughter Lucy at the beach when she was two. ‘I couldn’t find her for five minutes and sheer panic, absolute raw emotion goes through your body,’ Mr Petch said. Mr Petch said it brought back old memories from when he and a friend were abducted and held for 24 hours by an elderly lady in nearby street. 'She invited me across the road to eat some mandarins,' Mr Petch said. 'She locked one of us in the cupboard while she played with other, and threatened to hurt the one in the cupboard if the other one ran away.' Worried about his own children, Mr Petch couldn’t find a device that suited him, so he decided to invent one himself. The device is carried on the child and links to the Skynanny.net app, which can be downloaded to any iPhone or Android smartphone. It provides distance and direction information for users to quickly locate their child, and it alerts the user if a child moves outside of their designated boundary. It can also be set to detect that your child is moving away and then you are able to stop them before they wander off. But Dr Packer was sceptical of the usefulness of GPS trackers to prevent child abuse. Dr Sue Packer from NAPCAN said 'child molesters had become 'the 21st Century bogeyman' ,'everybody is potentially a child molester and we treat people like they are' 'More children are abused by people who are very well known to them than by strangers, and a GPS device is unlikely to change anything at all,' she said. 'The best way to ensure that doesn’t happen is to make sure everybody notices children and make everybody is willing to intervene. 'If you see a child who's distressed to do nothing is really a very scary option.' Dr Coulson said the devices would be useful for special needs children who are prone to wondering. 'If you’ve got a typically developing child I don't believe that devices that track children's movements are going to be particularly necessary, they're more for reassurance of parents than for safety of children.'","Two thirds of Aussie dads would think twice before approaching a child in distress in public over fears of being labelled a predator .

"With his tweed deerstalker hat and capacious line in overcoats, Sherlock Holmes isn't the most obvious of style icons. But according to photographer Kasia Wozniak, that's precisely what Arthur Conan Doyle's famous fictional detective is. Now, she has created a photo series entitled He Wasn't An Easy Gentleman to Describe, which takes as its starting point quotes found in the adventures of Sherlock Holmes. Recreation: Vivienne Westwood Gold Label, Maison Martin Margiela and Ed Lee contributed to these looks . Unlikely style icon: Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock Holmes is better known for his tweed deerstalker hats . The photos, which go on display at the Museum of London this week, were created with the help of Vivienne Westwood and Maison Martin Margiela, as well as recent graduates, Anna Bezgubenko, Charlotte Chan and Ed Lee. 'I have long been inspired by Arthur Conan Doyle’s ‘The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes’ and I couldn’t resist the chance to create a new and timeless fashion fantasy, using these as a springboard,' explains Wozniak. 'My photography is an incredibly manual process and uses a great deal of chemistry – almost alchemy. 'While mixing the chemical solutions needed to take my wet-plate photographs and developing in my dark room, I felt a great affinity with Sherlock Holmes. He often spends his days at the chemical laboratory too.' Eccentric: These Anna Bezgubenko and Craig Green looks were inspired by Arthur Conan Doyle's novels . In the photographs, which were styled by John William, Conan Doyle’s line: 'Don’t you remember the amateur who fought three rounds with you…?' from The Sign of Four manifests itself in a knitted jumper that once belonged to a boxing instructor and pair of tie-dye shorts by designer, Craig Green. Meanwhile, Sherlock’s experiments in medical laboratories are referenced in pieces from Anna Bezgubkenko’s AW14, which was inspired by the protective clothing worn by dissectors and medical students in the 1890s. More inspiration still comes from lines in, The Hound of the Baskervilles, A Study In Scarlet and The Valley of Fear, with Vivienne Westwood providing a cape to recreate the line: 'He was wrapped in some sort of dark ulster or blanket…' from The Sign of Four. The result is eccentric, with each of the eight photographs bearing a striking resemblance to the ensembles sported by the modern denizens of the trendy East End. Traditional: Ms Wozniak uses a century-old method of photography called the wet plate collodion process . Inspiration: Both of these looks were inspired by A Study in Scarlet and are by Pauline Edvall and Ed Lee (right) Curator Beatrice Behlen is not surprised. 'The streets of London are catwalks for parading individual style. 'Some outfits are easy to decode; while others are more difficult to read. Some appearances can be deceptive. 'Kasia’s photographic narrative catalogues a fantastical wardrobe for living and lounging in the city through the collections of established designers and recent London fashion graduates. I wonder what Mr Holmes would have made of it all?' The series is part of a major Sherlock exhibition at the Museum of London, which opens on the 17th October and delves into the impact Doyle's creation has had on the capital.","The photos are the work of Polish photographer, Kasia Wozniak .

"The owners of a dog-boarding kennel and two caretakers, one of them the son of U.S. Senator Jeff Flake, were indicted on animal cruelty charges on Wednesday after the deaths of 21 dogs at the facility in June. A state grand jury indicted kennel owners Jesse Todd Hughes and Maleisia Hughes each with 22 felony and seven misdemeanor counts of cruelty to animals and one count of fraud for the incident inside a cramped room at the Green Acre boarding facility in Phoenix, Arizona, prosecutors said. Authorities said the dogs died from suffocation and overheating. Senator Jeff Flake with his wife Cheryl and son Austin (right) in 2008. Austin Flake has been charged with 21 felony and seven misdemeanor animal cruelty charges after the deaths of 21 dogs . Some 21 dogs died from suffocation and overheating at the Green Acre boarding facility back in June (dogs are pictured at the facility) Caretakers Logan Flake and Austin Flake, son of Senator Flake of Arizona, were each charged with 21 felony and seven misdemeanor animal cruelty charges, according to the indictment. 'We now look forward to the next step in seeing that justice is served in this case,' said Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery, who has come under fire from the dog owners for taking too long in filing charges. The four defendants could not immediately be reached for comment. 'This is simply the next step in the legal process, and I have confidence in that process,' Senator Flake said in a brief statement. Sheriff's investigators said the dogs died while the owners were in Florida and left the Flakes to care for them. Some of the dog owners were initially told their pets had run away. The caretakers told authorities that they discovered a power outage in the room where the dogs were housed when they went to check on the canines. It was unclear how long the power had been off but temperatures reached 100 degrees. A preliminary investigation showed a hole scratched out of the drywall in a boarding area, which had exposed some electrical wires. These looked like they had been chewed through in places. Chewed: One of the dogs managed to gnaw through a wire for the air conditioning leading many of the pets crammed in the tiny room to die after temperatures soared . The dogs died on June 20 at the kennel in suburban Phoenix after being crammed into an 8x12ft room . According to ABC15, the Hugheses said the dogs died of heat exhaustion on June 20 in an 8x12ft room after a dog chewed through the air conditioner's power cord when they were gone for the night. The couple had gone on vacation to Florida and left their daughter Logan and son-in-law Austin in charge. Jacqueline Heath, who lost three dogs, said her home would never be the same. 'It still doesn't seem real that I'm never going to see these dogs again,' she told CBS as she broke down in tears. 'We don't have them running around. We're never going to have them to cuddle.' A group of the dog owners have filed a civil lawsuit against the Hughes and the Flakes, accusing them of fraud and neglect. The lawsuit in county Superior Court alleged that the dogs were confined in cramped quarters and faced 'neglect, mistreatment, physical injury and psychological abuse'. The four are scheduled to appear at a court hearing October 23. MailOnline was awaiting comment from Senator Flake on Thursday. The Republican senator, 51, lives in Snowflake, Arizona with his wife Cheryl and has five children.

"Long gone are the days of scratching posts and balls of wooll; the latest must-have cat accessory is a lifelike robotic mouse. Dubbed Mousr, the smart device is the first robotic cat toy that can see and react to a feline’s movements just like real prey. And finished models of the device will use artificial intelligence to learn about a cat’s behaviour. Scroll down for video . The robotic toy uses artificial intelligence to learn and react to a cat’s behaviour, in the same way a mouse of bird would, for example. Sensors built along the sides and top of the Mousr (pictured) recognise ‘external forces’ such as a cat’s paw . ‘Keeping cats as pets indoors is only a recent trend,’ said the Illinois-based developers from Petronics. ‘As such, domestic cats have maintained their natural hunting instincts, but lack a proper outlet to express them.’ That’s where Mousr comes in.

"One of America's biggest ice-skating stars has been suspended from the sport for two years after admitting to tampering with the skates of a Canadian rival. Simon Cho, 21, who admitted in October 2012 to sabotaging Olivier Jean's skates during the World Team Championship, was suspended until October 4, 2014, U.S. Speedskating announced. The ban means that Cho, who won a bronze relay medal at the 2010 Vancouver Games, will not be able to compete in the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. Regrets: Olympic speedskater Simon Cho, pictured last year, has been suspended for two years . After initially denying wrongdoing, Cho said in October that he used a blade bender to sabotage his rival's skates, the Associated Press reported. But he said former short track national coach Jae Su Chun told him to do so because he believed the Canadians had helped another team to eliminate the Americans. After the U.S. team had already been eliminated, he tampered with the skates using a blade bender normally used to ensure the blade follows the proper radius of the track. Last October Cho explained: 'The . repetitiveness and aggressiveness of how he came at me was very . intimidating... I knew he wasn't going to take no for an answer.' Scandal: Cho, pictured in 2011, said that he had tampered with a Canadian rival's skates at the 2011 World Team Championships at the demands of his coach, who was angry with the Canadian team . Victim: He adjusted the skates of Olivier Jean (pictured) so the team could not skate for the gold . The tampering meant the Canadians were unable to skate for gold, leaving them in the bronze position. The cause came to light during an inquiry into the actions of Chun after complaints stacked up against him. Chun has denied any involvement but the International Skating Union also imposed a suspension on him, saying he violated the sport's code of ethics. His ban is in effect until August 25, 2015. Cho, who trained in Salt Lake City before moving to Upper Marlboro, Maryland before trying out for the Olympics, has called sabotaging the skates 'the biggest mistake of my life'. 'I always knew it was wrong that day,' Cho said last October. 'I hope that I can make up for my mistake and . continue to skate in the future.' U.S. Speedskating issued a statement saying it 'respects the findings of the ISU' and will refer the matter to its disciplinary panel for a final decision. Promising: Cho (center) is pictured winning the gold as Jean (left) takes silver in the Mens 500m Final of the ISU World Short Track Speed Skating Championships in Sheffield, England in 2011 . The ruling came on the same day the U.S. short track team was picked for the upcoming World Cup season, an important step for a program that has been wracked by organizational infighting and allegations that coaches were abusive. Cho did not take part in the selection meet. 'As an organization, we are focused on supporting our athletes as they begin the season and work toward competing on the international stage the 2014 Olympic Winter Games,' U.S. Speedskating said in its statement. Cho appeared to be one of the rising stars in the U.S. He won a relay bronze medal at the Vancouver Games and an individual world championship in 2011.","Simon Cho, 21, admitted to the tampering last October and has been suspended until next October - meaning he will miss the Winter Olympics .

"Jarod Wetherell, 37, with his niece. He died of blood loss after falling off a mountain trial last week . A Colorado climber died of blood loss and his friend was injured after the pair fell off a mountain trail and waited two days for rescuers to find them. Jarod Wetherell, 37, was hiking with his friend David Richardson last Wednesday when the climbers, both from Vail, became separated. Both of them then fell after wandering off the trail on their descent of North Maroon Peak. They had taken a selfie after they reached the top, sending it to a friend in Vail, reports Post Independent. But the friend became concerned after not hearing from the climbers and called Pitkin County authorities that night. On Thursday, Mountain Rescue Aspen volunteers began the search, but weather conditions meant they could not deploy a helicopter. They spent two days searching for the pair, but Wetherell was dead by the time they found him on Friday near one of two peaks over 14,000 feet comprising the Maroon Bells near the ski town of Aspen. Mountain Rescue Aspen members brought Richardson, who injured his pelvis and ribs, to safety at 11:15 a.m. Friday. Sheriff's Deputy Michael Kendrick told Post Independent the climbers had gone off the trail. 'They climbed up South Maroon and traversed over to North Maroon,' Kendrick said. 'On their way down from North, they got off trail. Jarod Wetherell, 37, was hiking with his friend David Richardson last Wednesday when the pair, both from Vali, became separated .

The only way you know for sure what the trail was is if you went up that way. They didn't go up that way. They were coming back down a trail they had never been on.' Kendrick said the climbers ended up off the trail and fell down one of the gulleys. 'They were not roped together and fell separately at different times,' Kendrick said. ' The route coming down on the north side is not easy.' Wetherell was originally from Matunuck, Rhode Island, although he moved to Vail a year ago. 'He was just starting to explore his new home,' said Jenny Tucker,  Wetherell's many friends, reports Vail Daily. 'It was because he loved living here that he went on these grand adventures.'

"This year marks the 30th anniversary of the charity I set up with my husband Bill Travers and eldest son Will, after we appeared in the moving and highly successful film Born Free. The true tale of Elsa the lion cub and the game wardens, George and Joy Adamson, who raised her and then released her back into the wild has inspired and delighted generations. Over the years we have had the backing of The Mail on Sunday and its readers. To have that kind of support to make people think and care about animals is invaluable. It was an elephant which led us to establish the charity that became the Born Free Foundation. Scroll down for video . Virginia McKenna and Elsa the lion cub starred in 1966 movie Born Free (pictured) Cruel: Anthea pacing her prison - she was bought by a Tenerife restaurant owner as an attraction for his business . After the 1966 film, Bill concentrated on making wildlife films. One of them was An Elephant Called Slowly, about Pole Pole, a little female elephant who had been captured by the then Kenyan government when she was only two and given as a gift to London Zoo. Her sad story is told below and it prompted  us to set up Zoo Check, which later became Born Free. We have spent three decades exposing the suffering of captive animals and, sadly, it is work that is as necessary today as it was  all those years ago. We are desperate to improve the plight of more than 40 solitary elephants held in zoos and circuses in Europe. We also work with Elephant Family, the charity founded by the Duchess of Cornwall’s late brother, Mark Shand, to save the endangered Asian elephant. I continue to visit zoos around the world to monitor the animals kept there. Where possible we try to have them removed if they are in poor condition –  or at least to improve those conditions. When Bill and I set up Zoo Check, it was dismissed as a nine-day wonder. But today Born Free is an internationally renowned organisation with more than 100,000 supporters and a host of celebrity supporters, including Joanna Lumley, Martin Clunes, Helen Worth and Amanda Holden. Bill died 20 years ago and our son Will is now president of Born Free. And both of us feel as strongly about the cause as we did at the start. Bill Travers and Virginia McKenna visiting Pole Pole the Elephant - the animal was snatched from her wild family and given as a gift from the then Kenyan government to London Zoo . In the early days, I was nervous about putting forward my views because we were not scientists, and many people probably thought we didn’t know what we were talking about. But now, because I’m old, and I know I haven’t that much time, everything is more urgent.  I’ve got to speak out. I want to be judged for what I believe in. I still have plenty of fire and fight. This month I am publishing my first book of poetry, and I am taking a group of people to Kenya on safari. We will visit Elsa’s grave, of course, which will bring back many memories. I hope her descendants still roam the Serengeti. But there remains a lot of unending work to  do to ensure lions still live there in the future. My dream is to create a sanctuary for elephants in solitary captivity in Europe, perhaps in Italy or the South of France. The cramped cage that Anthea and Raffi lived in (left) and Rikki the leopard relaxing . Yesterday the Born Free Foundation lent its support to the Global March for Elephants and Rhinos. Our patrons, actress Rula Lenska, broadcaster Nicky Campbell and racing driver Darren Turner joined hundreds of members  of the public to draw attention to the 50,000 elephants killed every year for their ivory. Shockingly, an elephant is massacred every  15 minutes for its ivory, and a rhino is killed every nine hours for its horn. Often these magnificent beasts are still alive when their tusks and horns are hacked from their faces. Here are just a few of the Born Free Foundation’s success stories, many made possible by you. But we must do more. Won’t you join us? Join Born Free today for the original 1980s price of £12 to mark the 30th anniversary. Visit bornfree.org.uk to help elephants and other wild animals in need. Rikki, a sweet-natured leopard, was discovered in 1994 locked inside a 6ft x 6ft cage on top of a disco building in Tenerife, along with lions Raffi and Anthea. During his years of captivity, Rikki had suffered extreme distress caused by the barren conditions and lack of exercise. He was also suffering from poor nutrition. Rikki had been born in a travelling circus on the island before the restaurateur took him. Mail on Sunday readers raised thousands to free him and the campaign was joined by Janet Ward, mother of Julie Ward, the 28-year-old photographer murdered in a Kenyan game reserve in 1988. For five years Rikki lived in a wildlife sanctuary in Kent, run by the Born Free Foundation, before finally, in 1999, he was released into a sanctuary near Port Elizabeth in South Africa . This pair of lions were bought as cubs by a Tenerife restaurant owner as an attraction for his business. He also kept Rikki the leopard captive as a customer attraction (see his story below). For five years, Raffi and Anthea were incarcerated in the tiny, rusting cage perched on a sun-baked roof. Some reports at the time claimed they had been fed live dogs within sight of a luxurious hotel. Malnourished and frustrated, the thin and filthy lions spent their days pacing back and forth. Anthea and Raffi pictured being released from captivity in the the Shamwari reserve in South Africa . The Foundation launched a campaign to free them and, with the support of The Mail on Sunday, managed to rescue them in 1995. A special hotline was set up for the animals, and horrified readers of this newspaper contributed a total of nearly £60,000. The lions spent two years in a UK big cat sanctuary before being shipped to the Shamwari reserve where they were released and eventually reunited with Rikki, who had already been saved. Pole Pole was only two when she was snatched from her wild family and was given as a gift from the then Kenyan government to London Zoo. Bill and Virginia did everything they could to stop the move but the baby elephant’s fate was sealed. In 1982 the couple went to see Pole Pole in London and were dismayed by her miserable existence. With no companions of her own and prematurely aged by captivity, she had become difficult to manage. The death of Pole Pole the elephant inspired Virginia McKenna's Zoo Check, which evolved into the Born Free Foundation . Clearly frustrated, she paced her barren enclosure. But when they called her name she stopped, turned and came to them, straining with her trunk to reach their hands. ‘It was a heartbreaking and life-changing moment,’ recalls Virginia. The Travers renewed their campaign to give Pole Pole a better life, but in 1983 when she was just 16 (elephants can live to over 60) she died. Determined her death would not be in vain, in 1984 the Travers launched Zoo Check, which evolved into the Born Free Foundation. Call of the wild: Pitou the leopard is freed at last . For ten years, their home was a 20ft cage set into the cliffs of Monte Carlo. But after a five-year campaign by The Mail on Sunday and the Born Free Foundation, leopards Sirius and Pitou were set free in 2008. The animals were part of the Jardin Animalier, started in the 1950s by Prince Rainier. The decision to release them was taken by his son and successor Prince Albert. They were taken to the Shamwari reserve in South Africa, where Pitou, aged 14, set off with a roar from her cage. Sirius, 13, had to be coaxed out. The campaign had begun with a Mail on Sunday report that led to thousands of protest letters, which Virginia and a group of children delivered to Monaco’s consulate in London. Today he is the star of a much viewed YouTube clip. But in 1969, Christian the lion was bought as a cub from the then Harrods pet section by two young Australians, John Rendall and Ace Bourke, for 250 guineas.C . Naming him Christian, they raised him in their flat on the Kings Road, and he became a star of swinging London. He exercised in a nearby churchyard, and the friends wrote a book about him, A Lion Called Christian. But he grew from a 35 lb cub to a rather more imposing 185 lb adult a year later. His future was secured when he was spotted by Virginia and, with the help of George and Joy Adamson, was taken to Africa. A year later, Bourke and Rendall went to see him. Although warned they shouldn't approach Christian as he was now wild, the lion clearly remembered his human chums,and his exuberant delight at their reunion has become a YouTube phenomenon.

"Plea deal: Andrew Demers, 74, was indicted  on the severe count of Class A gross sexual assault and Class B unlawful sexual contact . A former police chief  has reached a plea deal with prosecutors on charges of gross sexual assault against a 4-year-old relative. Andrew Demers, 74, of New Gloucester was the former chief of Maine State Police and had been scheduled to appear in the Cumberland County Courthouse on Tuesday for a hearing. But Walter McKee his attorney said the hearing was postponed until next month because an agreement had been reached. A spokeswoman for Cumberland County District Attorney Stephanie Anderson also confirmed  the deal but said a judge still has to approve the terms of the plea agreement. Demers' was arrested in March and initially charged with Class B unlawful sexual contact with a person younger than 12. In April, the Cumberland County grand jury indicted Demers' on the more severe count of Class A gross sexual assault and Class B unlawful sexual contact, which allegedly  occurred this year. He pleaded not guilty to the charges. The alleged abuse had been taking place at Demers' house in New Gloucester for several months, according to the Cumberland County Sheriff Kevin Joyce. No other victims have been named. Police: Demers' was chief of Maine State Police from 1987 to 1993 and enjoyed a 26-year career until he retired . Demers enjoyed a  26 year career with the state police and served as chief for six years before retiring in 1993. The married grandfather, reportedly tried to kill himself days before the initial investigation was launched into whether he engaged in unlawful sexual conduct with a child. But he later confessed from his intensive care bed  at the Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston, according to the sheriff's office. In 2003, Demers became the most decorated officer in state police history and was named a 'Legendary Trooper,' according to a report in the Sun Journal. Yet he came under fire in the 1970s when it was alleged that he turned a blind eye to allegations of abuse against several boys by the founder of the Cole Farms Restaurant in Gray, who was a friend. Restaurateur Warren Cole was charged with sexually molesting a boy from 1986 1987. He was jailed in 1992. Demers' could face up to 30 years in prison if he is convicted of gross sexual assault.

"Boston police are trying to track down a daredevil teenager who was filmed dangerously climbing on top of a speeding subway to clown around on the roof. The investigation was sparked by a video uploaded to YouTube that was quickly spread on social media this week, showing the thrill-seeking hooligan in action. The clip depicts the careless young man climbing out of an MBTA train carriage, making his way to roof and performing precarious stunts. At one point the teen narrowly misses an approaching railway bridge, ducking down underneath it just in time. Scroll down for video . Daredevil: The male teen is seen here at the start of the video preparing to climb out of the MBTA train carriage in Boston .

Time to duck: The train surfer notices the railway bridge up ahead . Down: The teen (left) ducks down just inches from the bridge . Dangerous: The young man lies down in the small gap between the train and the bridge . Pleased with himself: The hooligan is all smiles after clearing the bridge . Silly: He even manages to pull a handstand while the train speeds down the track . At one incredible point in the video, the teen does a deaf-defying handstand and balances ontop of the train. He falls back to his feet and then laughs into the camera. MBTA spokesman Joe Pesaturo told Boston Magazine that the Transit Police had been made aware of the video. Detectives are now trying to find the boy in the clip. 'Obviously, such behavior is completely unacceptable,' he said. At the 'very least' the young man faces trespassing charges, Pesaturo added. The video has been watched on YouTube over 4,500 times since being uploaded on Thursday. One viewer who left a comment claimed to be employed by the MBTA and said they were 'traumatized' by the video.

"Many of us know not to click random links that are sent in emails or on Facebook, but now we’re being warned to be on our guard against dangerous files, too. Microsoft has discovered a vulnerability in its Office software that affects every version of Windows, except Windows Server 2003. And hackers are already exploiting the flaw to trick people into opening infected files and taking over their entire computer. Scroll down for video . Microsoft announced the flaw in a recent security advisory note. It affects every supported version of Microsoft Windows, including Windows 8, 7, and RT on tablets, but not Windows Server 2003. If a user opens an infected Office file, a hacker could gain access to their computer. Microsoft is currently working on an update . In an official advisory notice, Microsoft said it is ‘aware of a vulnerability affecting all supported releases of Microsoft Windows. ‘The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Microsoft Office file that contains an OLE object.’ OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) is a technology that allows applications to share data and functionality.

In an official advisory notice, Microsoft said it is ‘aware of a vulnerability affecting all supported releases of Microsoft Windows. ‘The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Microsoft Office file that contains an OLE object.’ Which versions of Windows are affected? It affects all supported versions of Microsoft Windows, which includes Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, and Windows RT. Windows XP is no longer supported - which means that when Microsoft issues updates, users running this operating system don't receive them - however, that doesn't mean it is guaranteed to be safe from attack. What is OLE? OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) is a technology that allows applications to share data and functionality. For example, a compound Microsoft Word document may contain an embedded Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, known as an OLE object. This technology also enables in-place editing, so instead of launching a new application when an OLE object is activated, the user instead can edit it inside their their existing application. Which files are at risk? The current Office flaw is already being exploited in a number of ‘limited, targeted attacks’ in which infected Microsoft PowerPoint files are being sent over email. However, in theory, any Office file is at risk, including Word documents and Excel spreadsheets. What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do? An attacker who successfully takes advantage of this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. How can I protect myself?

"A Melbourne author is going to extreme lengths to get a better understanding of his characters to pen his  novels from taking part in military training - which saw him kidnapped and tortured by electrocution - to scaling rooftops in Russia. Nathan Farrugia, 31, has written three thriller books by drawing from his wild and sometimes unbelievable experiences. He wrote his first book  when he was 10 years old but did not become serious about writing until he completed a stint in the Australian Army and studied film and television. Melbourne-based Nathan Farrugia, 31, puts himself in life-threatening scenarios to understand his characters . Pictured here scaling rooftops in Russia, Mr Farrugia immerses himself in the worlds of his novels. He has written three thriller books . Farrugia said he was not a 'professional' writer until 2012 when his first book, The Chimera Vector, was published. Soon The Seraphim Sequence and The Phoenix Variant followed. As part of his research for these novels and upcoming ones, Farrugia decided to take an escape and evasion course in November 2012 in Texas. During the week-long course, which is taken by U.S. Navy Seals and Special Forces, the author learned how to escape capture, pick locks, steal a car and how to disguise himself from Tony Mendez - the CIA agent Ben Affleck portrayed in biopic Argo. At the end of the week, he had to apply the skills he had acquired, except for stealing a car because they still 'had to operate within in law'. 'I was tied up in a motel in Houston in Texas with the heat turned up and Mexican television on in the background,' Farrugia told Daily Mail Australia. 'I was hooded and then waterboarded [a form of torture] and electrocuted - not too much but just enough to experience it - to experience the mental side of it and learning not to panic.' Part of the course included the use of paper clips and other tools that could be concealed and used to escape captivity . Farrugia said he went on these adventures to be able to get inside of his characters' heads and understand how they would get out of certain situations . In June, Farrugia met someone who took him onto the rooftops of Saint Petersbergt in Russia . Another scenario involved him being taped up, handcuffed and hooded as well as being tied up to two other people on a bed where they had five minutes to escape while concealing paper clips and other tools they could use to free themselves on their bodies. Farrugia said he went on these adventures to be able to get inside of his characters' heads and understand how they would get out of certain situations. 'My characters are more intelligent and more trained than I am and using skills to outwit each other and that's a major challenge,' he said. 'You can get around that by just looking stuff up but... it only takes you so far. 'It's good to experience all the different things and skills these characters know and put myself in their shoes and learn as much as I can. The novel writer says you can only get so far by researching scenarios from a computer or office . Two years ago, he met an urban explorer who took him underground to explore New York City's abandoned subway stations . 'And it has taken me to some different places and learn very different things.' More recently in June, Farrugia met a guy who was keen to show him a different view of Saint Petersberg in Russia, but he did not know it would mean risking his life. 'There are official tours where they take to buildings and they are not dangerous at all, whereas he took us all the way up and knew the ones that were unlocked and you could get in,' Farrugia said. 'He took us up fire escapes. They were quite steep and high and they went all the way up, almost to the roof. 'He jumps off them like in parkour movies and we waited for him to open a window for us. 'But he poked his head over the edge and dropped down an electrical cord and said: ""Come on up."" 'I thought ""This could be it"" because the cord was not dangling directly over the fire escapes, so if we fell, we would fall to the ground. It was very nerve-wracking.' Apart from being illegal, the venture was highly dangerous because the subways were still active . Mr Farrugia decsribed the experience as terrifying: 'I hoped he got the timing right. But we got there before the next train came' But this is not the only close shave, Farrugia has had. Two years ago, he met an urban explorer who took him underground to explore New York City's abandoned subway stations. 'It's not legal to do this. Another urban explorer popped out of a manhole once and people called police because they thought he was a terrorist,' Farrugia said. What made it so dangerous was the fact the railway lines, he and the explorer were walking along were still active. 'The tunnels are narrow so there's nowhere to get away from trains,' he said. 'We would climb down from the platform then basically run through the tunnel. 'I was terrified because I hoped he got the timing right. But we got there before the next train came.'

"Do children bring you happiness? Scientists have finally found the answer - and it's not pretty if you're a third, fourth or fifth child. New research shows that the birth of a first and a second child briefly increases the level of their parents' happiness, but a third does not. A new study by the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) and Western University, Canada reveals that parents' happiness increases in the year before and after the birth of a first child, it then quickly decreases and returns to their 'pre-child' level of happiness. A new study by the London School Of Economics shows the birth of first and second children increase parents' happiness level, but the arrival of a third child does not. Research also showed older and more educated parents are happier before and after a baby's arrival . The pattern for second births is similar, although the increase in happiness before and around the birth is roughly half of that for first births. But when it comes to an increase in parental happiness surrounding the birth of a third child, it seems the effect is negligible. Mikko Myrskylä, professor of demography at LSE and Director of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, Germany, said: 'Our results show a temporary and transitory gain in parents' happiness around the birth of first and second children. 'The fact that parental happiness increases before these children are born suggests that we are capturing broader issues relating to childbearing such as couples forming partnerships and making plans for the future. 'The arrival of a third child is not associated with an increase in the parents' happiness, but this is not to suggest they are any less loved than their older siblings. 'Instead, this may reflect that the experience of parenthood is less novel and exciting by the time the third child is born or that a larger family puts extra pressure on the parents' resources.' It is thought that the arrival of a third child could have less effects on their parents' happiness because parenthood is less novel and exciting by the time they are born . The research also revealed that there were big differences in how men and women's happiness were affected from the arrival of a new baby. Compared to men, women gain more in happiness in expectation of, and right after, the birth of a child. Women also have steeper drops in their happiness than men between the year of the birth and the year afterward, possibly because of the larger initial gain. However, in the long run, there are no differences between the happiness levels of men and women before and after children. The arrival of a third child can also put extra pressure on the parents' resources . Despite the difficulties associated with being older parents, scientists also discovered that those who have children at an older age have a particularly positive response to a first birth, the same was experienced by or men and women who were more educated. Older parents, between the ages of 35 – 49, have the strongest happiness gains around the time of birth and stay at a higher level of happiness after becoming parents. Those who become parents in their teens have a predominantly declining pattern of happiness that does not increase above the baseline even during the year of birth. Those who become parents between the ages of 23 -34 have increasing happiness before a first birth, however one to two years after the birth, happiness decreases to baseline or below. Rachel Margolis, assistant professor from Western University's Faculty of Social Science, said: 'The fact that among older and better-educated parents, well-being increases with childbearing, but the young and less-educated parents have flat or even downward happiness trajectories, may explain why postponing fertility has become so common.'","Study by LSE shows first and second birth increase parents' happiness level .

An Australian architecture and interior design company has pushed the boundaries of apartment development by creating convertible pads of the future . The convertible apartment can be adjusted to your preference and depending on what configuration you adjust it to, it does or doesn’t have to have a bedroom. The firm was inspired by Japanese interior design where moving walls are used to completely redesign whole apartment in a number of minutes. Rothelowman has drawn up the designs for a new development with is now under construction at Abbotsford in Victoria.

The new apartments will feature pull-down beds and movable walls to enable residents to change their apartment to suit their needs . The apartments are currently being built as a gateway to the Victoria East Precinct. According to Rothelowman, the project will ‘raise the standard for excellence in large scale inner city urban housing developments.’ The new apartments will feature pull-down beds and movable walls to enable residents to change their apartment to suit their needs.

"The optimism of Labour MPs who opted for Ed Miliband as their leader has all but evaporated . For the more perceptive farmyard turkey, it has been a troubling week. The annual John Lewis advert has hit our TV screens; Oxford Street has a new set of lights; and British pop groups are signing up for another revival of Band Aid. But at least the turkeys can say they never voted for Christmas –unlike the dozens of Labour MPs who opted for Ed Miliband as their leader four years ago and now face a similarly bleak fate. Back in the summer, most of those MPs were quietly confident the party would win the Election next May, but that optimism has evaporated. First, there’s the Nigel Farage factor. For two years, Labour strategists have been saying: ‘If Ukip keep doing well up to 2015, we’ll win a majority.’ Now the fear is that Ukip will do too well next May, taking large numbers of votes off Labour MPs, not just the Tories. Then there’s the Scottish problem, where the collapse in Labour’s poll ratings has put a huge dent in the party’s chances of forming a majority at Westminster. That dual threat from Ukip and the SNP will also force Labour to spend money it doesn’t have defending dozens of seats it thought it could take for granted. But what’s worrying Labour MPs above all is their leader. That Miliband-shaped elephant has been in the room ever since he won the leadership, but his MPs have so far contrived to ignore it. After all, the polls had been suggesting that even if people didn’t rate Miliband personally, it wouldn’t stop them voting for Labour. There was also a sense that once people got to see a bit more of him, his ratings would get better. I mean they couldn’t get any worse, could they? The past six weeks have shattered both illusions. Since his calamitous party conference speech, Miliband’s popularity has plumbed new depths, even falling below Nick Clegg’s. And in escalating numbers, even lifelong Labour voters – those who stuck with the party in 2010 – are now telling local activists that the ‘Miliband issue’ will affect their decision next time round. On Monday, one poll put Labour on 29 per cent – the same rock- bottom rating it achieved at that 2010 Election; a shock for Labour MPs who thought things could never get that bad again. Against that restless backdrop, Miliband executed a mini-reshuffle, prompted by the departure of Shadow International Development Secretary Jim Murphy. Personally, I would have appointed some hard-nosed hatchet carrier with a remit to plan the department’s abolition and channel Britain’s overseas aid through agencies such as Oxfam instead. Instead, in a move that could charitably be described as defiant, or uncharitably as daft, Miliband used the reshuffle to elevate three of his closest allies. Thanks to the so-called Farage effect,  the fear is that Ukip will do too well next May, taking large numbers of votes off Labour MPs,forcing the party to spend money defending seats it took for granted . Most notably, the adviser who managed his leadership bid, Lucy Powell, has been put in full charge of Miliband’s operation and Labour’s campaigning, less than two years after becoming an MP. Outside Westminster, most people knew little and cared less about these appointments, but inside the party they mattered hugely – not so much pouring oil on Labour’s troubled waters as introducing a shoal of piranhas. What they said to Labour MPs was that Miliband is not interested in listening to any of their concerns about his leadership. Far from being willing to change, he is cocooning himself ever more tightly in a circle of like-minded acolytes. The appointment of Lucy Powell in this week's reshuffle was not so much pouring oil on Labour’s troubled waters as introducing a shoal of piranhas . So this is the reality that Labour MPs face – they have a leader who is more unpopular than Clegg, but too arrogant either to admit it or do anything about it. And if he is not prepared to change, the question is, what are they prepared to do? There is one group – the reluctant plotters – who know that openly challenging Miliband may be their only hope, but constantly talk themselves out of it. They fear that divided parties always lose, that it’s too close to the Election, and that there’s no obvious candidate to take over – not least because none of the current Shadow Cabinet will go near any discussion of plots. Most of all, with memories still raw of attempted coups against Gordon Brown, they worry about ending up with that worst of all outcomes – a failed putsch, even though Miliband has nothing approaching Brown’s army of spies and bodyguards, not to mention his survival instincts. If there was a genuine assault on Fort Miliband, their defences would last as long as the Maginot Line. There is a second group – the professional optimists – who still hope Labour can muddle through and win under Miliband. Finally, there is a third group – the stoical cynics – who believe the Election is already lost and have no intention of challenging Miliband because they want all the responsibility for the defeat hung round his neck. But the danger is that May’s Election may be the last chance that Labour MPs ever get to be a party of government. By the 2020 Election, Britain could be out of Europe, Scotland could be independent and a Right-wing coalition that pushes through boundary changes could be in a position of permanent dominance within an ‘English Parliament’. If Labour MPs are fearful of that scenario, then May is their win-or-bust opportunity to avert it, and if they believe they cannot win with Miliband, then now is the time to do something about it. Unlike the Christmas turkeys, Labour MPs do have control over their fate, but their time to use it is fast running out.","Optimism of Labour MPs who opted for Ed Miliband as their leader is fading .

"There is the Dukan diet, the Atkins diet, the 5:2 diet and countless other cunning plans which offer you that shimmering mirage of the perfect bikini body. The low-carb diet was basically ‘goodbye, spuds, rice and bread’. The Mediterranean diet meant lots of grilled fish and olive oil and playing The Gypsy Kings on the CD player. The tapeworm diet involved swallowing a tapeworm which — so the highly implausible theory went — would gobble up some of your spare calories from the inside. It seems amazing anyone fell for that one. Political heavyweight: Lord Falconer (left) as he was when he served in Tony Blair's administration and as he is now (right) To these weight-loss fads we can now add the Falconer Diet, named in honour of a former Lord Chancellor, Charles Falconer, who in the past ten months has shed 5st, nearly a third of his old weight. The politician formerly nicknamed ‘Fatty’ Falconer is a porker no more. His lordship, who served in the Cabinet when his former flatmate Tony Blair was Prime Minister, was 16½st two years ago. Today, after a routine of one meal a day (dinner), the Labour peer is down to 11st 5lb. His regime included some nine cans of Diet Coke a day and lots of fruit. He seems to have devoured as many apples as a much-patted Dobbin at the local pony club. Even as the news was being reported yesterday, less-than-slender Britons were no doubt wobbling off to the supermarket to stock up on apples and Diet Coke. The Falconer Diet - up to nine cans of Diet Coke a day and as many apples as you want . Isn’t that the way with diets? The copycat mentality takes a grip and suddenly we are all after grapefruits or lemonade or whatever the ‘new secret cure’ for tubbiness might be. A few years ago it was cabbage soup. Remember that? The offices of Britain started ponging like boarding-school corridors. I have sometimes wondered if the cabbage soup diet was an enormous practical joke, devised to get the whole country parping away like Noddy’s little car. So what is the biggest lesson we should draw from the ‘Falconer diet’? Before the whole world goes mad and some publisher commissions him to write the latest diet book for the post-Christmas market, the basic truth of his remarkable weight loss was this: he stopped gorging. He also went on five-mile runs most days. And he gave up alcohol. Quite a sacrifice, for the old Lord Falconer was a notably convivial fellow, a Falstaffian figure with a voice that gurgled agreeably as the Chateau Agitator went down his capacious gullet. He was, by his own admission, practically the only New Labour grandee who would booze at lunchtime. At times, it was as though he — perhaps along with his former Cabinet colleague Charles ‘Two Pizzas’ Clarke — was trying to make up for the rest of the abstemious Blairite crew. Then Falconer looked at himself last December and realised he had to alter his ways — or face problems such as diabetes and heart disease. And so he took control of his appetite. You could almost say he became a bit obsessive about it. Was there maybe something a little bit typically male in that? Men love to follow orders, be decisive, smite the table and say: ‘Right, this is the way it’s going to be from now on!’ Lord Lawson of Blaby as he was before he wrote The Nigel Lawson Diet Book (left) and as he is now (right), twenty years later, having kept the weight off . Falconer’s inspiration was former Tory Chancellor Nigel Lawson, another one-time chubster who went on a dramatic weight-loss plan of his own devising (and got a publishing deal out of it). Lord Lawson also shed 5st, in part by giving up Stilton, replacing butter with lemon juice, and exercising, yes, willpower. When it comes to dieting, are women not prone to a certain amount of wishful thinking? I know that I tread, here, in a minefield. Dieting ladies can be snappy, their sense of humour worn thin (dread word) by disgusting skinny noodles, low-cal nutrition bars that taste of cardboard and mix-in-a-cup lentil soups with the consistency of washing-up liquid. One generalises at one’s peril, but there is a gender difference when it comes to dieting. Men become competitive. They stand on the bathroom scales in the morning and greet each lost pound with a Neanderthal grunt of triumph. They regard flab as a challenge. They come over all macho about going without elevenses, saying: ‘The SAS go days without eating when they’re on manoeuvres.’ How does a woman approach the endeavour? Her methods are gentler. She negotiates with her grumbling tummies. She makes deals: a chocolate bar at the end of a virtuous day, an almond croissant to keep a non-dieting friend company (‘because I don’t want her to feel bad’). Before you rush to tick me off, there are scientific studies to support this. One school of thought says higher levels of oestrogen cause women to form an emotional attachment to certain foods, making it harder to give them up without some degree of regret. They are more likely to ‘comfort eat’ than men. Men, meanwhile, tend to have more natural muscle mass than women, and it is muscle that helps burn more calories when exercising. So men are more likely to see the immediate effects of diet and activity and feel spurred on. With women, the weight is slower to shift and the lack of immediate progress demoralising — and cause for a consoling violet cream. Having been on the portly side since childhood, I was put on my first diet when I was 12. My mother, having read something in the newspapers, announced that I would be going on a ‘steak diet’. She even bought me a special sharp knife with which to eat the steaks that were going to transform me from Bunter to a drainpipe. Alas, steak was a little beyond her shopping budget, so I ended up being given Bird’s Eye steak burgers, which were rather less slimming than a butcher’s sirloin might have been. Then some fool wrote an article about how cheese was good for slimming, so I was given hunks of cheddar to go with my burger. Inevitably, my trousers became only tighter. My wife is an exception to the rule that women talk about losing weight, let you know they are on a strict regimen — then have a bar of chocolate each evening before bed. I don’t know if she will thank me for saying this, but my wife diets like a bloke. A couple of years ago, she announced her intention to begin going to a Zumba dance class. The weight started falling off, she lost 2st and looked (and looks still) super. One day, she cast a leathery glance at my gut and left it to be understood that a little regime might be in order for me, too. Any thought of joining the Herefordshire ladies at a Zumba class in my mankini was beyond the pale, but I pretty much gave up white flour, particularly bread, and managed to lose a stone-and-a-half. It has stayed off, happily, because being a chap I have the willpower to keep it that way. But I don’t intend, just yet, to do a Lawson or Falconer. Lord Lawson was unrecognisable after he went from 17st to 12st. It is almost as difficult today to recognise Lord Falconer. The old Charlie has been replaced by someone who could be the brother of football manager Sven-Goran Eriksson. He is wrinkled, flashes a not entirely convincing smile and poses in a pair of lean-guy denim trousers. Mister Fitness! But the voice has maybe lost some of its bonhomie and there is something spare, something missing, in his parliamentary personality these days. He is not the man he was. Professional dietitians were already tutting yesterday when they examined his weight-loss strategy. They deplored the fact that he ate no breakfast, and said we are healthier if we have something in our stomachs at the start of the day. They were twitchy about all those cans of Coke. Most of all, though, I suspect they may have been uneasy that Lord Falconer had proved that the most effective way of slimming is simply cutting back on the nosebag. He is not the first to have done this. Ten years ago my friend Simon Carr, an 18st parliamentary sketch writer, lost more than 5½ st in 40 days. It was like watching air go out of a lilo. How did he do it? He limited himself to 200 calories a day, drinking only water. Back then, too, the professionals from the multi-million-pound diet industry were appalled. How could they make money out of their diet books, diet CDs and diet DVDs if some maniac showed that eating very much less is the surest way to lose weight? For that, I’m afraid, is the cold truth of the matter. Detox, Dukan, dooby-doo-woo . . . if it’s a smaller dress size you’re after, ladies, there is no alternative but to stop scoffing so much, stop boozing and buy some running shoes. In short: approach your weight loss like a man!","Of all the exotic diets out there, eating less works by far the best .

"Australians living in the major cities will pay hundreds of dollars a year more for gas as prices rise. A report from the Grattan Institute says has found that an average household gas bill in most major centres will soar by hundreds of dollars a year. In Melbourne the price shock will be double most of the other big cities, the increase is expected to be as much as $435 a year and the country's very strong position in an emerging export industry is to blame. Australians living in the major cities will pay hundreds of dollars a year more for gas as prices rise . Capital city residents are set to be hit hard with gas bills to jump significantly. Melbourne in particular will be hard hit with average household costs increasing as much as $435 a year . The think-tank's energy program director, Tony Wood, argues the emergence of a Liquefied Natural Gas export industry over the next five years, which could be worth about $60 billion a year, will actually push prices up as Australians are forced to compete in the international market for supplies. Australia will also struggle to meet its 2020 emissions reduction target, Mr Wood warns, as more coal is used for electricity generation in the face of rising gas prices. In Melbourne, where 90 per cent of homes use gas for all their cooking, hot water and heating, an average bill could rise be as much as $435 a year, he said. Sydney and Adelaide residents can expect a price gouge of more than $200 for their annual gas bill but Brisbane is expected to be spared . High gas users in Sydney will face an increase of about $225, while high users in Adelaide will pay an extra $200 a year. However, people in Brisbane, where gas consumption is low, would not be hit so hard. 'Gas producers have been building Liquefied Natural Gas facilities, mostly in Queensland, since 2010, and will start exporting as early as this year,' the report states. 'By 2018 east coast gas, added to growing West Australian supplies, could create the world's biggest gas export industry, worth $60 billion a year. By 2018 planned gas exports from the east coast and WA could make Australia's industry worth more than $60 billion a year, to the detriment of the domestic market . 'The downside is that domestic gas prices will increase to compete with the higher prices that other countries are prepared to pay for our gas.' But Mr Wood says governments should resist pressure to introduce subsidies or the like to protect Australian industry and consumers. 'Reserving or subsidising gas for domestic use will add more costs than benefits and do nothing to increase supply. And in the long run, protection harms everyone,' he said. The report says that for low users of gas - those using a gas cook-top or small-capacity gas hot water system - the increase to an average bill could be contained to less than $50 per year.","Australia's strong position in the gas export market to blame .

"The horrifying moment an 87-car freight train in Louisiana careered into an 18-wheel tractor trailer stuck on a crossing has been caught on camera. Juanita Schulze exclaimed 'holy Mother of Moo Moo' as the train rammed into the trailer, which got stuck on tracks at a crossing in Mer Rouge on Sunday in the north-east of the state. A terrifying crunch can be heard as the train smashes through the trailer, which was carrying a crane rig. Scroll down for video . Horrifying: This image shows an 87-car freight train just a split-second before it smashes into a truck stuck on a railroad crossing in Louisiana . Shocked: Juanita Schulze exclaimed 'holy Mother of Moo Moo' as the train rammed into the tractor-trailer, which was carrying an enormous crane rig . Several of the train's cars contained toxic substances and Ms Schulze's husband, David, who runs a garden business in Texas, quickly reversed their car, telling his wife 'we've got chem leaks'. 'Oh my God, tell me he [the truck driver] got out,' Mrs Schulze exclaims, clearly shocked by what she's witnessed. 'It was like something off TV,' she adds. The footage shows the enormous train grind to a halt, with the truck wreckage strewn alongside the track. At the end of the clip white gas can be seen billowing out from a smashed container. The smash happened right in front of the town police station, so the police were immediately on the scene, Mr Schulze said. The subsequent clean-up operation by Hazmat crews continued into Monday, state police said. The engineer and conductor were injured in the accident, which derailed two engines and 17 cars, with one airlifted to hospital.

Union Pacific Railroad Co. officials said the conductor's injuries weren't considered life-threatening. He was being treated at a hospital in Shreveport. They say the engineer suffered minor injuries. Mer Rouge Police Chief Mitch Stephens said about 50 houses were evacuated for about two hours due to concerns that a tank car of pressurized argon gas might explode. Another tank of argon, an inert gas used to fill light bulbs and in arc welding, leaked until it was empty, he said. Stephens said the trailer got stuck on the tracks crossing Highway 165, but trucker Daniel Shackleford, of Freedom, Missouri, was unhurt. Shackleford was hauling a rig owned by Taylor Truck Line of Northfield, Minnesota. 'He saw the train coming and he jumped out of the truck,' Stephens said.

"Up to 100,000 Mormons from around the world will arrive in Salt Lake City this weekend to listen to words of guidance and inspiration from the faith's leaders during a biannual church conference. Thousands of the attendees will be coming from countries outside the U.S. — most stopping on their way into the 21,000-seat conference center to grab headphones so they can listen to speeches translated into 94 different languages. It is widely anticipated that one or more of this weekend's speakers will deliver an address in a language other than English, marking a first in the history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' biannual general conference. Members of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir singing during the opening session of a Mormon church conference in Salt Lake City that happened in April this year . Church leaders recently announced they would make that option available to speakers. A non-English speech would be an important representation of the internationalization of a church that was founded in 1830 by Joseph Smith in upstate New York, say scholars who study the religion. 'It's a hugely important symbol, because it reveals that the religion is becoming less and less a small, interesting American sect, and more and more a diverse, global religion,' said Matthew Bowman, a Mormon scholar and history professor at Bowling Green State University in Ohio. The number of church members outside the United States first surpassed the number within the country in 1997, and today more than half of the faith's 15 million members reside in non-U.S. countries, said Matt Martinich, a church member who analyzes membership numbers with the nonprofit Cumorah Foundation. The faith has established footing in several Latin American countries that are rooted in Catholicism, including Brazil and Mexico, which both count more than 1 million church members. Membership growth is driven by a missionary force of young men and women who proselytize around the world. The Salt Lake Temple (pictured) in Temple Square in Salt Lake City will host the conference this weekend . The nearly 85,000 missionaries serving around the world are more than at any time in church history. But behind the glowing international membership numbers lays a real and challenging problem for the church — keeping new converts active in the faith, Martinich said. His group's analysis shows that foreign church members are significantly less active in church activities than Mormons in the U.S. Many factors play into this, he said, with the most pertinent being a disconnect between missionaries who lured them to the faith and local church members tasked with keeping them active, he said. Philip Barlow, a professor of Mormon history and culture at Utah State University, said retention of international members is a real challenge because the church tends to baptize converts quickly. That makes their commitment 'vulnerable and tender,' Barlow said. But hearing a general conference speech in their own language this weekend could be a special moment that will make international members feel more a part of the faith, Barlow said. 'It will reinforce the international spread of the church, but will also signal a deepened sensitivity and respect for those speakers and listeners who are not fluent in English,' Barlow said.","More than half of the faith's 15 million members reside in non-U.S. countries .

"A US defense contractor has been killed and a second injured after a shooting at a gas station in the Saudi Arabian capital Riyadh - and it was all over a workplace conflict, Saudi authorities believe. Abdulaziz Fahad Abdulaziz Alrashid, 24, opened fire at the gas station in a western district of Riyadh - killing one contractor in his car and wounding a second. He chased the second American into the gas station before police arrived. Alrashid - who is a dual US-Saudi citizen - had recently been fired for drug use by Vinnell Arabia, a US defense firm that is working with the Saudi National Guard. It is believed the victims were his former supervisors, Saudi authorities said. Alrashid was born to Saudi parents in Washington state. He had traveled to France, Germany, the United Arab Emirates, the United States and most recently Bahrain. The attack occurred about half a mile from the Vinnell Arabia compound and 20 miles from the US Embassy. The victim was shot dead by a gunman at a filling station on the eastern outskirts of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia . It is understood a second US defence contractor ran from the car into the nearby shop, escaping serious injury . A third American contractor, who was following in another vehicle, witnessed the attack, but was not injured. Police cornered Alrashid in the gas station and wounded him in a brief gun battle. He was later apprehended and charged. Saudi authorities were quick to say that the attack was not terrorism related. Instead, they said it was the act of a disgruntled former employee. Still, it rattled many of the thousands of Western expats who live and work in Saudi Arabia. With tensions in the region heightened due to conflicts with ISIS extremists in Syria and Iraq, and with Saudi officials concerned about rising domestic militancy, security at Western compounds is being stepped up. 'We will be heightening security around our compound,' said the manager of a Western residential compound in Riyadh. Most security at Western compounds has been provided by the Saudi Arabian National Guard since a string of attacks on foreign targets a decade ago. 'That area would be on my way to work and I'm in that area often stopping at local shops and buying things. I might avoid stopping there for a while,' said one US national living in Riyadh. Police said the attack happened when the two stopped their vehicle at a filling station in an eastern district of the capital. Saudi security forces surrounded the gunman shortly after the shooting and arrested him after a gunfight . U.S. officials were in close contact with Saudi government as they gathered details about the shooting and a possible motive, the official said on condition of anonymity because the investigation was at a very preliminary stage and he was not authorized to discuss the case publicly. U.S. authorities were also evaluating their security posture, and will take appropriate steps to ensure the safety of all U.S. Mission personnel, the official said. In September, Saudi police said they had arrested 88 people suspected of being part of an al-Qaida cell that was planning attacks inside and outside the kingdom. The attack happened on the eastern outskirts of Riyadh about 20 miles from the US embassy . Saudi Arabia and four other Arab countries are taking part in U.S.-led airstrikes against the Islamic State group and al-Qaida fighters in Iraq and Syria. Militants have vowed revenge. The Islamic State group's spokesman has also urged sympathizers to kill Americans and those from other countries that are carrying out airstrikes against the group. Attacks by al-Qaida militants from 2003 to 2007 were aimed at destabilizing and toppling the Western-allied monarchy. Among the most stunning attacks were deadly bombings of residential compounds in Riyadh where foreigners lived in 2003. Saudi officials responded at the time with a massive crackdown that saw many al-Qaida operatives killed or arrested. Others fled to neighboring Yemen, giving birth to one of the group's most active branches. A group of al Qaeda-linked men suspected of carrying out the 2007 attack on a group of French nationals have been on trial in Riyadh and are currently awaiting a verdict.","American national gunned down in gun attack in Saudi capital Riyadh .

"Almost 20,000 families may be hit with the financial burden of laying to rest their loved ones after people signed up to unprofitable funeral plans immediately after World War II. Gavin Turner lost his mother Beryl Turner to Parkinson's disease two years ago and has been locked in a legal battle with a funeral company ever since after he was told he owed $7,195 despite Ms Turner setting up her own pre-paid plans in 1948 when she was just 16. The court decision over who must pay the money will be handed down on Thursday which could have serious ramifications for about 19,500 other Queenslanders signed up to the same funeral plan. Scroll down for video . Beryl Turner set up her own pre-paid funeral plans in 1948 when she was just 16 . Gavin and his wife Fiona Turner approached Alex Gow Funerals with the certificate and were told Ms Turner's money had been placed in a Queensland Government trust,  and was now only worth $390 . Alex Gow Funerals provided 1,000 of the plans including Ms Turner's while 18,500  are with Metropolitan Funerals. Gavin said his mother would be 'mortified' by the situation after paying small contributions over 32 years for a funeral service so her family would not have to suffer the financial burden. 'It was after the war, they had seen a lot of people who did not have access to a proper send-off so I think they were very mindful that you should put things in place,' he told 7.30. Gavin and his wife Fiona Turner approached Alex Gow Funerals with the paid certificate his mother had received when she made her last payment in 1980 and were told her money had been put in a Queensland Government trust which was now only worth $390.

'If I can stop one or two more families in Queensland from having to deal with this, then I feel that us bringing it to light has been a very decent outcome.'

"Cheese made from sheep's milk is being falsely sold as goat's cheese in British supermarkets, according to an investigation. Consumer watchdog Which? tested 76 samples of goats' cheese and found that nine contained cheese from sheep milk. It said it became suspicious about the large amount of goats' cheese on sale, despite a European shortage of goats' milk and became worried goats' cheese manufacturers could be substituting goats' milk for other milks. Which? joined forces with Professor Chris Elliott, a food safety expert at Queen's University, Belfast, and author of the government's independent review into the food supply network, to investigate the content of goats' cheese. A new study has revealed cheese made from sheep milk is being sold in supermarkets as goat's cheese. File image used . They bought 76 samples of goat's cheese from supermarkets, delis and markets from eight locations around the UK and tested them to see what they really were. In total, nine samples were adulterated: three contained more than 80 per cent sheep's cheese, another three contained more than 50 per cent sheep's cheese and the final three around five per cent sheep's cheese. Researchers would not reveal the retailers which shops were selling fake goats cheese. Which? said: 'Sadly these results are not an isolated incident and reinforce the need for better checks so that people get what they pay for and can trust the food they buy. Prof Elliott said: 'We tested the cheese samples for a wide range of different animal species. I had actually expected to detect some adulteration with cow's protein but what we found was substantial amounts of sheep protein in six cases. 'When I looked into why sheep products had been used, the answer seemed to be that there is plenty of this around and the taste to most of us will be very similar and thus 'undetectable' by the consumer. 'In four of the six cases the goat's cheese product was heavily contaminated with sheep protein originating from outside the UK. My message is not that all things foreign are bad, but that when supply chains are long and lack local knowledge and long term relationships there must be more opportunities for cheating and thus more checks are needed. This is not the first time Which? has uncovered food fraud this year. In May they tested lamb kebab takeaways and found that 24 out of 60 contained other meats, either chicken or beef or a mixture of both. And six of these contained no lamb at all. Both chicken and beef are cheaper than lamb, so a substitution cuts costs for manufacturers and caterers. In May, Which? tested takeaway lamb kebabs and found 24 out of 60 contained other meats.

"Devoted: Queen Victoria with servant Abdul Karim . Scroll down for video . He was the Indian servant whose relationship with Queen Victoria caused controversy throughout her kingdom, violating Victorian taboos of race and class and even threatening her place in history. Now the current Queen is set to cash in on Abdul Karim’s scandalous links with her great-great-grandmother by renting out his former home on the Balmoral Estate. The recently renovated Royal Deeside retreat has even been named Karim Cottage and can be hired for between £705 and £1,080 per week. Nearly 120 years ago, the cottage was home to Karim, a servant who was at the centre of a row that even led the Prince of Wales to threaten to have his mother declared insane. In 1897, Queen Victoria celebrated her Diamond Jubilee – the first British monarch to do so. But beyond the grand celebrations on Britain’s streets, a war was raging between Victoria and her court over her relationship with her Indian servant, mirroring that of her earlier friendship with her Scottish servant, John Brown. Originally one of two Indians selected to join the Queen’s household, Karim rose from being a humble waiter to become Victoria’s most intimate confidant. Arriving at court in 1887, aged 24, he introduced her to the delights of Indian cuisine, fed her romantic visions of India, and became her ‘Munshi’ or teacher, giving Victoria daily lessons in Hindustani. Queen Victoria was 68 and had never recovered from the loss of her husband Prince Albert 26 years earlier. Her only other close male confidant, her servant John Brown, had died in 1883. The lonely Monarch showered Karim with honours and promoted him over courtiers whose families had served the Royal Family for generations, sparking jealousy. And their Hindi translation exercise books betray a flirtatious relationship. Lucy Worsley, curator of the Historic Royal Palaces, said: ‘He wrote things like, “The Queen will miss the Munshi very much. Translate. Hold me tight. Translate.” It does seem quite personal and intimate.’ Victoria’s indiscreet affection caused consternation in the Royal household, led by the Queen’s private secretary Sir Henry Ponsonby and her doctor Sir James Reid, who resented the ambitious young Indian upstart who was breaching all protocol. The Queen is set to rent out Karim's former home on the Balmoral Estate (pictured) for up to £1,080 per week . The interior of the three-bedroom cottage, which is set in the grounds of the Balmoral Estate, is rather modern . When her Viceroy in the sub- continent – the Earl of Elgin – failed to reciprocate after being sent a Christmas card from Karim in 1894, he was rebuked by the Queen for snubbing her favourite. The Viceroy then sent an assistant, Fritz Ponsonby, son of the Queen’s private secretary, to look into Karim’s background in India. He had proclaimed himself the son of an Indian army surgeon, but it emerged his father was an apothecary at the local prison, where Karim himself had been a clerk. Sir James revealed this to the Queen, telling Karim: ‘You are an impostor. You are from a low class and never can be a gentleman.’ But Victoria was livid, stating in a memo to her private secretary: ‘To make out the Munshi is low is really outrageous.’ She then expressed a wish to bestow a knighthood on her servant and on the eve of the Diamond Jubilee, threatened to pull out of the celebrations. Abdul Karim (right) came to England in 1887 to wait at the Royal table at formal dinners.

After Queen Victoria's death in 1901, Karim (pictured together above) retired to India until his death in 1909 . Her son Bertie, the Prince of Wales, then encouraged Dr Reid to deliver an ultimatum that: ‘There are people in high places who know Your Majesty well who say to me that the only charitable explanation that can be given is that Your Majesty is not sane, and that the time will come when, to save Your Majesty’s memory and reputation, it will be necessary for me to come forward and say so.’ The threat hit home and Queen Victoria conceded defeat. There was no knighthood for Karim, though he remained at her side throughout the celebrations. However, when she died, in 1901, he was dismissed from court and sent back to India. In renting out three-bedroomed Karim Cottage, Balmoral Estate advertises that ‘the property was built by Queen Victoria for Munshi Abdul Karim’. The advert adds that the property is available throughout the year ‘with the exception of some weeks during the Royal Visit’ when it is believed it is used by courtiers and Royal protection officers.","The Queen is set to rent out Abdul Karim's former home on Balmoral Estate .

"Plans are being drawn up to curb Scottish MPs’ voting rights, amid English anger at the sweeteners offered to persuade voters north of the border to reject independence. Government sources say David Cameron and Nick Clegg are ‘very aware’ of backbench fury over the hastily pulled together ‘devo max’ proposals. But any move to restrict MPs’ voting rights will be opposed by many senior Labour figures, who will try to push back a deal until after the next election. Tory MPs last night warned they could throw out the entire plan to hand greater powers to Scotland unless the huge ‘subsidy’ paid by English taxpayers via the so-called Barnett formula is also ended: Salmond (left) and Cameron (right) ahead of the referendum . Even if he loses the referendum Alex Salmond (above) will be given yet more powers . Tory MPs last night warned they could throw out the entire plan to hand greater powers to Scotland unless the huge ‘subsidy’ paid by English taxpayers via the so-called Barnett formula is also ended. Deputy Prime Minister Clegg said yesterday that it was ‘simply not fair’ to hand sweeping new powers to Scotland without also limiting the right of Scottish MPs to vote on English matters at Westminster. The Lib Dem leader was confronted on the issue by a series of angry English callers on his phone-in show on LBC. They questioned why England should continue to subsidise Scottish policies such as free care for the elderly, free university tuition and free prescriptions, which are not available south of the border. The Prime Minister has avoided discussing the issue in recent weeks, for fear of handing a propaganda victory to the SNP. But senior Tories last night indicated that Mr Cameron will move swiftly to announce plans for ‘English votes for English laws’ in the event of a No vote. Proposals drawn up for the party in opposition by former chancellor Kenneth Clarke can be ‘taken of the shelf’, and are likely to be unveiled formally in January alongside devolution plans for Scotland, they said. ‘It’s something the party has long had a position on and it is obvious that something now needs to be done,’ said one senior Conservative. But Labour fears the move could prevent the passing of legislation on key issues such as health and education. If cross-party pledges to devolve major tax powers are put in place, Scotland’s 59 MPs could even be prevented from voting on parts of the Budget. Former prime minister Gordon Brown – who is leading Labour’s efforts in Scotland – ruled out reducing the rights of Scottish MPs as part of any post-referendum constitutional deal, saying: ‘I don’t think you can have two classes of MPs at Westminster.’ Gordon Brown – who is leading Labour’s efforts in Scotland – ruled out reducing the rights of Scottish MPs as part of any post-referendum constitutional deal . But Tory MPs said it would be ‘untenable’ to allow Scottish MPs to continue to enact laws in England that do not affect their own constituents. And several indicated they would vote against any package that retained the Barnett formula – which means public spending per head is £1,623 a year higher in Scotland than in England. MP John Whittingdale said: ‘I for one would be very concerned at the idea that my electorate would continue to subsidise the Scots even after they have been given all these powers to raise even more money.’","Nick Clegg said it was ‘simply not fair’ to hand powers to Scotland without also limiting the right of Scottish MPs to vote on English matters .

"Scottish Second World War heroes who saw off Nazi attacks while sailing across the Arctic Ocean raised a glass of vodka to celebrate after they were honoured by the Russian government. During the war the brave men were on convoys which sailed four million tonnes of vital supplies to soldiers battling against Hitler's troops on the Eastern Front. Around 3,000 civilian sailors lost their lives on the missions, which Winston Churchill called 'the worst journey in the world', between 1941 and 1945. But today 48 Scottish veterans were finally honoured by the Russian government for the sacrifices they made to help the then Soviet Union. Down the hatch: Second World War veteran Robert Thomson drinks a shot of vodka after the medal ceremony in Edinburgh today . Mr Thomson was among 48 Scottish Second World War veterans honoured by Russia for seeing off Nazi attacks while delivering vital supplies to Allied forces fighting on the Eastern Front . Heroes: The 48 men were honoured at a ceremony at St Mary's Cathedral in Edinburgh today . Veterans: A total of 48 of the men were honoured at a service at St Mary's Cathedral, in Edinburgh, today, including Robert Thomson (left) and Harold O'Neill (right) Never forgotten: Around 3,000 civilian sailors were killed on the convoy's dangerous journeys from Scotland to the battlefield, with Nazi ambushes and freezing conditions to contend with . The Foreign Office had previously blocked the Russian government's plans to honour Britain's Arctic heroes because it said it would break rules surrounding the acceptance of medals. But after nearly 70 years, dressed in smart blazers and decorated with awards, dozens of surviving sailors took their place in the front row for a special ceremony at St Mary's Cathedral in Edinburgh today. A total of 48 Scots were presented with the Ushakov Medal - for exceptional bravery and courage at sea - in front of their friends and family by Russian officials. Harold O'Neill, 92, from Haddington, East Lothian, was in London when the war started and joined the Royal Navy as a Seaman at the age of 20. He said he had always wanted to volunteer and go to sea, adding that he was surprised how tough the experience would turn out to be. He said: 'I was part of the Royal Navy, we were called Churchill's pirates. When you had a meal on the boat there was more on your lap than down your throat, the sea was that bad. The convoys, with crews from Britain and other Allied navies, sailed four million tonnes of vital supplies to soldiers battling against Hitler's troops on the Eastern Front . Better late than never: The Foreign Office had previously blocked the Russian government from awarding the WWII heroes the Ushakov Medal . Proud: Kenneith Reith proudly wear his Ushakov Medal, which is only awarded to those who show exceptional bravery and courage at sea . Mr O'Neill (pictured) said Britain would have lost the war was it not for the convoy's vital deliveries to soldiers fighting against Hitler's troops on the Eastern Front . The Arctic convoys also carried coal, ore and timber back to Britain after delivering weapons and ammunition to the frontline . 'Life at sea was pretty rough. I can say it was an experience. It was really tough. 'I feel very honoured and very thankful because Russia has always thought about us. I have three Russian medals. 'I am very proud about what I have accomplished. Not just me but other people involved. 'If we hadn't supplied the Russians with four million tonnes of equipment then we would have lost the war and I wouldn't be sitting here. 'The Germans had a far better army than ours. When Germany attacked Russia they had an army of over three million. 'If we hadn't supplied them in order for them to fight back we would have been bloody well stuck.' Many of the ageing veterans were unable to attend the ceremony themselves, but 12 of them were represented by family members. The Arctic convoys did not just carry arms and supplies to Soviet ports - they also carried back vital raw materials such as coal, ore and timber to beleaguered Britain. Respect: Russia is giving medals to more than 200 Scottish veterans over the coming months . The Ushakov Medal was named in honour of Russian admiral Fyodor Ushakov who never lost a battle and was proclaimed patron saint of the Russian Navy . Timofey Kunitskiy, the Russian vice-consul general in Edinburgh, said there had been a strong desire to recognise the sacrifice made by Arctic convoy sailors. He said: 'Russia has been committed to pay respects to the British veterans of the Arctic convoys just as they pay respects to their own veterans. 'Some of these veterans already have Russian medals awarded to them before but some years ago the Russian government decided to award a completely different type of award to these sailors - an award that is given specifically for bravery in the sea. 'We are going to give the medals to more than 200 veterans across Scotland. We were planning the ceremonies for November and December but we were approached by many veterans bringing our attention to the fact that Remembrance Sunday is coming. 'Within one week we managed to organise this great ceremony thanks to the hospitality of St Mary's Cathedral. 'Arctic convoys were one of the real demonstrations of the war time alliance Britain and Russia had 70 years ago. 'These particular medals are one of the highest Russian military decorations.' The Ushakov Medal was named in honour of Russian admiral Fyodor Ushakov who never lost a battle and was proclaimed patron saint of the Russian Navy. Russia has already awarded the medal to veterans from Australia, Canada and the US for their parts played in helping to fight off the advance of Hitler's forces between 1941 and 1945. Ceremonies will also take place later this week in Glasgow, Aberdeen and Inverness, with 214 veterans being recognised across Scotland.","Dozens of Scottish WWII veterans were honoured by Russia today .

These particular toes caused some alarm for an Adelaide woman who awoke to find them peeking out from beneath her seat on a recent flight . Camille was recently flying from Adelaide to Darwin when the large and unclean feet stretched out to touch hers . 'I was sleeping and they scared the crap out of me,' she told the NT News. 'Having seen snakes on the plane (recently) definitely didn't help the situation.' But it's not the first time a passenger has faced a similar intrusion. There's a Passenger Shaming website run by former flight attendant Shawn Kathleen that is littered with photos disgruntled people have shot during their travels. Passenger Shaming was set up in March 2013 to highlight some of the less than desirable habits some have adopted while flying. The photos, which are submitted anonymously by passengers and flight attendants, are posted to Facebook and Instagram and the results are sure to shock. But it's not the first time a passenger has faced a similar intrusion, with a Passenger Shaming website set up to allow disgruntled people to share strange habits of their fellow flyers . The website, run by former flight attendant Shawn Kathleen, is littered with photos disgruntled people have shot during their travels, including this shot of a child's potty in the galley . Passenger Shaming was set up in January 2013 to highlight some of the less than desirable habits some have adopted while flying . A flyer shot these clearly dirty nappies a fellow passenger had stuffed in the seat pocket . Since its inception the site has drawn attention from passengers and flight attendants across the world and its Facebook page now has more than 250,000 likes. 'Initially it was mostly crew members who were sending photos through, but now it's probably 75 percent passengers and 25 percent crew. The passengers are over it,' Ms Kathleen told Daily Mail Australia. 'I'm getting inundated with (photos) right now. I'm getting 50 a day via email and Facebook.' Ms Kathleen, who worked as a flight attendant for seven years, says she is accustomed to the less than desirable behaviour displayed by some passengers. 'I did this stuff but not to this extent. Some of this stuff is ridiculous. The dirty diapers are huge. Some people think it’s staged, but it happens literally every day where people stuff them in the back of the seat or throw it on the ground,' she said. Bare feet are also a common occurrence on tray tables, walls and stretched into other passengers' personal space.

This man obviously thought he was still in his own lounge room, rather than an airline lounge . It's not even clear what this passenger was thinking as she slept with what looked to be a see through jacket . Recent photos in the past month shows a suit jacket over the back of a man's seat, a potty in the aisle, people sleeping in inappropriate areas and dirty nappies stuffed in the seat pockets. Images to have been previously uploaded include people resting their feet near other passengers' heads, clipping their finger and toenails, eating smelly food and leaving a wake of destruction behind them. 'Probably one of my favourites is one with the feet coming through the middle of a seat,' Ms Kathleen said. The inspiration for Passenger Shaming came when the former flight attendant started receiving photos from people who read her blog, Rants of a Sassy Stew. 'That focuses on me obviously ranting about poor passenger behaviour and telling stories I experience,' she said. 'Then I thought I'd branch off on social media using photos. Now I have the photos to back up what I've been talking about on my blog. 'They prove I'm not exaggerating - this is how ridiculous people are on air planes.'

"James Sherwood, 27, has spent the best part of the last year and a half recovering from an accident that left him in an induced coma with severe brain injury. 'It was so bad the doctors said they were surprised I could use my eyebrows again, let alone talk and walk out of there,' he told Daily Mail Australia. At about 2 am on March 9, 2013, Sherwood was hit by a taxi while crossing the road to the Marrickville train station in Sydney's Inner West. He doesn't remember anything from that point on but knows from hospital staff that a stranger came to his aid. Now, he is looking for that 'guardian angel' - but all he knows is that her name starts with 'M'. 'It could be Melissa or Melanie maybe,' says Sherwood. 'I really just want to let her know that the person she helped that night is alive. I hope to meet her one day just to say thank you.' 'I just want to thank her'': James Sherwood is looking for the woman who saved his life more than a year after he was hit by a taxi at a pedestrian crossing in Marrickville in Sydney's Inner West . 'When I came into Emergency, the ambulance guys told my mum there was a woman who gave me first aid - they mentioned CPR - then the last thing she said  was that she was going to go and clean herself up because she had my blood all over her.' 'We know that she made calls to the hospital in the days following but her details were lost in the stress and the paperwork.' The accident that night crushed Sherwood's upper boy, left him with a collapsed lung, a fractured skull and traumatic brain injury. Sherwood says he had been working late on a short film and was on his way home after dinner with friends. He was looking down at his mobile phone when he walked out onto the pedestrian crossing and was hit by the taxi. The road to recovery, he says, has been a long and strange one. He came out of the coma with a 'very weird' accent and it was a few months before he had a 'functioning memory' again. He still has problems with short term memory like recalling people's names. 'I'm covered in post it notes a lot at the moment,' says Sherwood. 'A  brain injury - it's like tampering with your soul, it's who you are and it has changed me,' he says. 'It has probably made me a lot more positive a person. The smaller things that come up in life, I wouldn't have been so forgiving about them before or seen  the good in hard situations.' The taxi driver was never charged. 'Induced/ Into the Void': A self portrait by James Sherwood . Sherwood was hit by a taxi when he stepped onto a pedestrian crossing on Illawarra Road in Marrickville  in the early hours of March 9, 2013 . As well as his life, Sherwood says he owes a large part of his miraculous recovery to the stranger. 'Just knowing that there was someone like her out there has helped me through this year - it’s given me faith to pull through,' he said, adding that it is only now that he has 'had the brain power' to be able to start properly looking for her. Two weeks ago, he launched a community art project which he hopes will help him find 'M', as well as raise awareness about using mobile phones when crossing the road. The project, called 'Look Out (For Each Other),' will involve street  and public art around Marrickville and Sydney's Inner-West from the end of December. But Sherwood is also appealing to the public to help him find 'M'  through a new Facebook page 'Finding my Hero'. His story was picked up by Sydney's popular 'Humans of Newtown' blog and Facebook page and Sherwood says he's touched by the hundreds of responses that have already come in from people he doesn't know. 'Bits and pieces' of information have started coming through, he says, but he's still looking for his saviour that night. 'If she's in Sydney, word will have to reach her pretty soon!' The incident occurred on March 9 2013, about 1.50am on Illawarra Rd, Marrickville.

"Would you like to know your medical future? In five years most Australians will be able to find out if they will develop cancer, diabetes, heart and other diseases, through a medical breakthrough - genomic testing. Australians will no longer need to send their blood samples overseas for genomic testing, as the Garvan Institute, one the country's largest medical research institutions, will soon have the analysis available to patients. In five years most Australians will be able to find out if they will develop cancer, diabetes, heart and other diseases, through a medical breakthrough - genomic testing . Australians will no longer need to send their blood samples overseas for genomic testing, as the Garvan Institute, one the country's largest medical research institutions, will soon have the analysis available . After registering through the National Association of Testing Authorities, within the next 12 months genetic testing will be available to Australians seeking the analysis. Professor John Mattick, executive director at Garvan Institute, said that 'once in a generation something comes along that completely changes society' 'Once in a generation something comes along that completely changes society', Professor John Mattick, executive director at Garvan Institute, told The Daily Telegraph. 'This is the equivalent of the introduction of vaccination in the twentieth century.' The first Australians to benefit from these tests will be cancer patients, with oncologists now able to send  samples for genomic testing within twelve months. But genome testing has only been made possible after the Garvan Institute received their last ten illumina gene sequencing machines, cutting the cost of genome sequencing down to $US1,000. These cuts have allowed the institute to be able to financially afford the tests, with genome testing  costing them under $AU2,000, Professor Mattick said. He also believes that if a large amount of people seek out these tests then the price may possible reduce to just several hundred dollars within the next five years. Now Garvan Institute is submitting a request to get Medicare funding, providing evidence that genome testing may save the health system millions. Patients with pancreatic cancer have been found hard to treat, who according to Garvan Institute has the same genetic mutations that cause breast and bowel cancer. This discovery could be life saving - along with the genome testing - with cancer no longer being described by the organ it appears in, but by the genetic mutation that causes it. Sydney's Prince of Wales hospital has already begun trailing out genome testing, in the hope to find out the cause of intellectual disabilities in children. After registering through the National Association of Testing Authorities, within the next 12 months genetic testing will be available to Australians seeking the analysis . Nearly 80 per cent of these problems cannot be not known with the use of traditional diagnostic procedures. 'We’re spending thousands of dollars on unproductive diagnostic odysseys trying to find out what’s wrong and many parents never get an answer,' Professor Mattick said. With the introduction to genome testing in Australia, genetic and rare problems in children may see a possible treatment after a common problem is mapped out. But this breakthrough does not go without practical and ethical difficulties. People may find it hard knowing they have a life threatening problem, especially when it comes to employers and insurers discriminating against them. But the National Health and Medical Research Council insist that health insurers are not able to refuse insurance to anyone who is predisposed to a fatal condition. People who chose to have a genome test down, must report it to their health insurance.

"Tortured: Abdul Hakim Belhaj wants to sue the UK government because, he claims, it helped kidnap him and his wife and deliver them to Colonel Gaddafi . British courts will hear the case of a Libyan politician who says the UK government helped kidnap him and his wife and deliver them into the clutches of Colonel Gaddafi. Abdul Hakim Belhaj and Fatima Boudchar want a declaration of illegality and compensation over the UK's alleged involvement in their rendition in March 2004 and subsequent torture. 'My wife and I are gratified by the judges' decision to give us our day in court,' said Mr Belhaj. 'Our part of the ""deal in the desert"" - the kidnap, the secret CIA jail, the torture chamber in Tripoli - is as fresh and as painful for us as if it happened yesterday.' The case covers a period from when Mr Belhaj and Ms Boudchar were detained by Chinese authorities at Beijing airport for two days before being deported to Malaysia and held for two weeks. They were then flown to Thailand, ostensibly en route to London, and later taken to Libya on an aircraft said to be owned by a CIA front company. Mr Belhaj says that, in Bangkok, they were detained by American intelligence and he was tortured while his pregnant wife was chained to a wall. When they got to Tripoli, he spent six years in jail and his wife was released shortly before giving birth. The Court of Appeal's decision to allow the case to go ahead reverses a High Court ruling that their claim against former foreign secretary Jack Straw and Sir Mark Allen, ex-head of counter-terrorism at MI6, should be struck out. The Master of the Rolls Lord Dyson, Lord Justice Lloyd Jones and Lady Justice Sharp said that the proceedings were not barred by state immunity and the act of state doctrine, as government lawyers argued. Lord Dyson said that the allegations were of particularly grave violations of international law and human rights. 'The respondents in these proceedings are either current or former officers or officials of state in the United Kingdom or government departments or agencies,' the judge said. 'Their conduct, considered in isolation, would not normally be exempt from investigation by the courts. On the contrary there is a compelling public interest in the investigation by the English courts of these allegations.' He added: 'Unless the English courts were able to exercise jurisdiction in this case, these very grave allegations would go uninvestigated and the appellants would be left without any legal recourse or remedy. 'Notwithstanding evidence from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office that there is a risk that damage will be done to the foreign relations and national security interests of the United Kingdom, we do not consider that this can outweigh the need for our courts to exercise jurisdiction in this case. 'Here, the risk of displeasing our allies or offending other states, cannot justify our declining jurisdiction on grounds of act of state over what is a properly justiciable claim.' The judges stayed the claims pending the outcome of an appeal to the Supreme Court against their ruling. In 2013, Mr Belhaj had offered to drop his case for £3, an apology and an admission of liability, but this was rejected. In a letter sent to Prime Minister David Cameron, Mr Straw, and Sir Mark, he said: 'I am making an open offer to settle our litigation. 'My wife and I are willing to end our case against the UK Government and Messrs Straw and Allen in exchange for a token compensation of a British pound from each defendant, an apology and an admission of liability for what was done to us.' The deal in the desert: Former Prime Minister Tony Blair infamously meeting with Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi at his desert base outside Sirte, south of Tripoli, in 2007 . Sapna Malik from Leigh Day, the legal firm which represented the family, said: 'The Court of Appeal has rightly recognised that the gravity of the allegations raised by our clients makes it all the more compelling for the English courts to get on and deal with their case and to reject outright the attempts by Jack Straw, Mark Allen and the government defendants to shield their conduct from judicial scrutiny. 'Our clients are now a significant step closer to seeing justice done in their case.' Cori Crider, a director at Reprieve, which also represents the family, said: 'The Government so fears this case going to trial that they have stalled for years by throwing up a parade of scarecrows - claiming, for example, that the United States would be angered if Mr and Mrs Belhaj had their day in Court in Britain. 'The Court was right: embarrassment is no reason to throw torture victims out of court. The Government's dubious and wasteful delay tactics in this case need to end. Enough is enough.' Accused: Sir Mark Allen, former counter-terrorism chief at MI6, and Jack Straw, the former foreign secretary under Tony Blair, are both named in the lawsuit brought by Mr Belhaj and his wife . Andrea Coomber, director of Justice which intervened in the case together with Amnesty International, The International Commission of Jurists, and Redress, said: 'The Government's case would fundamentally undercut the international rule of law and undermine the global commitment to remedies for victims of human rights violations. 'The 'they did it too' defence traditionally hasn't worked in the playground. Yet, the UK Government would - in expanding the 'act of state' doctrine and the scope of state immunity - seek to enshrine it in common law.' 'We welcome the decision of the Court of Appeal. States cannot be encouraged to supplement the international law of state immunity with their own pick and mix patchwork of domestic rules on justiciability.' Amnesty International UK director Kate Allen said: 'It's only right that UK officials - right to the very top if necessary - are answerable for actions that may have led to terrible mistreatment at the hands of Gaddafi's henchmen in Libya. 'The UK has been trying to place itself above the law - a shocking response to a very serious case. 'British officials have got their paw prints all over this case and it's far too late for them to pretend otherwise. 'The UK should now stop blocking attempts to discover the full truth about the involvement of British officials in this sordid and deeply troubling affair.'","Abdul Hakim Belhaj and his wife say they were kidnapped by MI6 and CIA .

"Southampton opened their doors to a remarkable £40million training facility on Wednesday, yet their main hope is that the scented massage rooms, bacteria-killing washing machines and ‘Black Box’ can, at the very least, match the talent-reaping brilliance achieved in the portacabins of their past. Sportsmail was invited to a behind-the-scenes look at the new Marchwood facility, a stunning home to the brilliant minds and methods that have done so much to create one of the most celebrated production lines in British football. ‘Five years ago we had a single-storey brick building and cabins,’ said chairman Ralph Krueger. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ronald Koeman: It's great for to play every three days (archive) Ronald Koeman, owner Katharina Liebherr and chairman Ralph Kruger attend the official opening of the new training complex . Southampton's new training facility has been named after former owner Markus Liebherr who 'saved' the club from financial ruin . That was before the late Markus Liebherr pumped his money and thoughts into a club that had already nurtured Gareth Bale and Theo Walcott. Today, in a centre named after the German, the Premier League’s second-ranked club have a training centre that Martin Hunter, their technical director, hopes might yet produce enough homegrown players to fill half the first team. Another aspiration, spoken by several at this club, is to see Southampton ultimately gatecrash the top four. On arrival at this remote Hampshire base, the scale of the operation is obvious. There are nine training pitches, ranging from the 60x40-yard surface used by the Under eights to the one next to the pavilion that uses the same type of turf and matches the dimensions of the St Mary’s pitch. ‘Everything here is about progression,’ said Hunter. ‘The eight-year-olds want to get from that pitch to this one, right next to the pavilion. They start in small football, one v one, two v two. Concentrate on the game not the system. Premier League high-fliers Southampton unveiled a new state-of-the-art training centre on Wednesday .

The Southampton academy and first-team players will be able to relax in the pools after training or when recovering from injury . Former Southampton owner Liebherr pictured when taking over the club in 2009 with former boss Alan Pardew (left) The extensive gym and training areas will enable Southampton's players to work on their strength and fitness of the pitches . ‘They learn the principles of attack and defend. The teams from Under 15 and up will have a flexible variant on 4-3-3 (as they do at Ajax’s famed academy), but the kids start with a ball and they learn to play, to think for themselves. ‘If they progress they go from the academy and Under 21 dining room to the first-team dining room.’ Cameras are next to the pitches – nine to be precise, with another 16 cameras on the way. ‘We want to have every view that might make us better,’ said Paul Mitchell, their head of recruitment. The footage from those cameras is studied live by eight analysts, with a dedicated analyst for each of the Under 18 and Under 21 squads. All those training on these pitches have already been scrutinised physically and mentally by the recruitment team and scouting group of four, led by Rod Ruddock, who was central to the discoveries of Bale and so many others. Their scouting network includes a further 30 ‘consultants’ out in the field. Their latest tool is called the ‘Black Box’. It’s a two-tiered windowless room next to the analysis suite, with a huge touchscreen and viewing gallery. ‘It is our own software,’ Mitchell said. ‘I won’t tell you how much it cost because I’d rather other clubs did not know. In here, the manager will come to see what we have compiled on prospective new players.’ The gym at the Staplewood Football Development Centre, with machines displaying the club crest, is of the finest quality . Southampton want all the players from the different age groups to be integrated into one at the new training centre . The software processes the vast information compiled on potential senior signings and junior recruits, from school grades to video clips. When the club rebuilt its decimated squad in the summer, many of Ronald Koeman’s final decisions were shaped in this room. ‘It is all about making up the small percentages,’ Hunter said. It extends to the laundry room of kit man Mark Forde. ‘We spent 18 months researching the washing machines,’ he said. The amount of oxygen pumped into these specific machines has all but eliminated bacteria from kit. ‘It all helps keep the players healthy,’ Forde added. They are also known to bring bespoke mattresses to away matches. Then there are the two massage rooms. ‘You can change the lighting, the smell and music – it is hard to measure the impact but, along with our psychology department, we want to see if they stimulate certain hormones,’ said Mo Gimpel, the sports science and medicine manager. ‘We want them to help a player relax on a recovery day or invigorate them on a hard training day.’ Arsenal ace Theo Walcott and Real Madrid superstar Gareth Bale both graduated from Southampton's academy before moving on . England internationals Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Luke Shaw also progressed through the Saints academy before moving on . Gimpel’s department claim to have statistics from a UEFA audit that shows they are best ranked in the Premier League for injury prevention over the past two seasons. In context, he estimates his department, that also studies the running patterns of the eight-year-olds, is half the size of that at Manchester City. To be achieving more than a club of such resources seems implausible. ‘The challenge now is staying ahead,’ said Gimpel. ‘It’s not just the young players here who have to progress. We have done well so far. You’d hope this magnificent facility adds a bit more. We want to punch above our weight.’ So far so good.","Premier League high-fliers Southampton are keen on attracting the next batch of rising stars to St Mary's .

"A model student who had been dabbling in drugs hanged herself after worrying about her A-level exams, an inquest has heard. The body of Amy Latham was found in woodland near to her home in Wimborne, Dorset, 36 hours after she left a note for her parents telling them not to bother looking for her. The 18-year-old had sat her exams in English, biology and chemistry in the days prior to her disappearance. The inquest heard Amy, who had got mostly A grades in her GCSEs two years previously, started suffering from depression in April this year, two months before her death on June 30. Detective Inspector Joe Williams, from Dorset Police, told the inquest: 'Amy had been concerned about her A-levels which she had just taken at Queen Elizabeth’s School in Wimborne, and she was undecided and unsure about her future. 'She had also been caught speeding and it was likely she was going to lose her licence.' Detective Inspector Williams said Amy had been reported missing after her father Graham returned home from work to find her gone. He found three notes written by Amy in her bedroom, one of which read: 'To save you spending time looking for me I’m dead.' A major police search was launched and the following day Amy’s body was found. Amy’s mother Susan, 51, told the hearing she had no idea her daughter had been so unhappy. She said: 'I felt it was no more than teenage angst, having just sat her A-levels wondering what to do after and also an up-and-down boyfriend, but nothing unusual. Amy was a student at the Queen Elizabeth's School in Wimborne, pictured, and had already sat her exams in English, biology and chemistry in the days prior to her disappearance . 'There was no indication that she felt life was not worth living.' Asked if Amy had been concerned about her A-level grades, Mrs Latham replied: 'She felt she could have worked a bit harder but I don’t think she felt like she had flunked them.' Ryan McClelland, Amy’s boyfriend, said that when he first started seeing Amy in July 2013 she was a 'happy, care-free and loving individual' but she had sunk into depression around April this year. He said: 'She told me she was hearing voices in her head. She said no-one cared about her. I could tell she was becoming depressed - it was as if she was having a battle with the voices in her head. 'A month before her death she did say she was going to kill herself and that she would be better off not being here. 'I didn’t actually think she would follow through with it.' Mr McClelland said when he last saw Amy two days before she died she was 'unhappy and crying'. He added: 'After she dropped me home I sent her a text message telling her I loved her. She replied “I’m really sorry for wasting your time”. 'I was extremely worried for Amy and what she was going to do.' Amy's body was discovered in woodland near to family home on this road in Wimborne, Dorset . The Bournemouth inquest heard how Amy had taken to using drugs including cannabis, ecstasy and legal highs in the months leading up to her death. A post mortem examination found traces of cannabis in her body but gave the cause of death as hanging. Mr Sheriff Payne, the Dorset coroner, recorded a verdict of suicide. He said: 'Amy was very successful at school and in sports. She had a wide circle of friends and was well loved. 'But it would appear behind the scenes she had these worries, these concerns. 'Her parents certainly had no inkling about her unhappiness leading up to her death. 'All the evidence brings me to a very sad verdict that she has taken her own life.' Following the inquest, Amy’s family issued a statement in which they described her as a 'very bright and kind person'. It said: 'Her loss has left a huge hole in our family. She will always be remembered with love and sorely missed.'","Amy Latham was found dead in woodland near to her home in Dorset .

"Manchester United's players have been getting to know new boss Louis van Gaal and will be getting familiar with his personality and some of his managerial traits. Here, Sportsmail has exclusive extracts from Maarten Meijer's explosive new book on the Dutchman which lifts the lid on the new man in charge at Old Trafford. They are two giants of Dutch football. Johan Cruyff, arguably the country’s greatest player, and Louis van Gaal, one of the greatest managers of the modern era. And they have a feud which has festered throughout four decades. Some believe that proud Van Gaal resented the adulation heaped on playing legend Cruyff, the man who had the place at the heart of the Ajax team that an ambitious reserve wanted for his own. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis Van Gaal's best moments at Manchester United so far . Giants of Dutch football: Louis van Gaal takes on Johan Cruyff during a Sparta Rotterdam match against Ajax . Bad chemistry: According to Van Gaal, Cruyff accused him of not thanking him for hosting a Christmas dinner . All smiles: Van Gaal poses with Man United assistant manager Ryan Giggs and club legend David Beckham . Others think Cruyff felt he was owed . more respect by a young player who couldn’t match his own stellar . achievements. It might even have been as simple as Cruyff once put it: . ‘We have a bad chemistry.’ Whatever the precise beginnings, the feud is bitter. It is long-standing, apparently irreparable and riddled with curious altercations. In 1989, for example, Cruyff hosted a Christmas dinner. Van Gaal was among the guests and enjoyed the night. Until the phone went. For Louis. It was his family, with the news that his sister had died. Van Gaal hastily left to be with his family. According to Van Gaal, Cruyff blamed him for not having had the character to thank him properly for the Christmas dinner before leaving. Cruyff denied this: ‘Nonsense. If Van Gaal actually said this, he has Alzheimer’s. Seriously, if someone thinks that of me, he lost the plot - he probably lost the whole trilogy.’ The battle began when the pair first met as players at Ajax. Louis was the young boy in the second team whose path to the top was blocked by the legend playing in the same position. Both are vocal, dominant and cocky. You need to be when you play at Ajax, especially when you want to be a playmaker. In the hotseat: Van Gaal poses with Man United legend Bobby Charlton after being named the club's new boss . Cruyff was the pivot at Ajax, and Van Gaal, four years his junior, was biding his time to replace the  master. He impressed in the youth system with his skills and vision but was too slow to succeed at the top. Their paths crossed time and again. Cruyff excelled as Ajax coach before Van Gaal took the job and spent his first few months in charge hearing calls for the great man to return. Van Gaal, a surprise appointment to many, was struggling to impose his ideas and had to listen to the name of his rival being chanted from the stands. By the time he was winning multiple titles and the Champions League, Cruyff was having equal success in charge of Barcelona but neither could muster the courage to congratulate the other. On the contrary, when Cruyff was asked in the mid-1990s which clubs other than Barcelona played good football, he didn’t mention Ajax - instead referring to Parma and Auxerre, teams that ousted Ajax from the European tournaments in earlier seasons. The intriguing similarities in their careers continued when the Cruyff reign at Barcelona ended and, after Bobby Robson’s one season, Van Gaal took over. Cruyff had been Barcelona’s longest-serving coach. With 11 trophies, he was also the club’s most successful. But he never forgave Van Gaal for taking the job he felt should be his. Around 2000, when Frank Rijkaard, a Cruyff disciple, was head coach of the Dutch national team, Cruyff presented a development plan to the Dutch FA. When the federation picked Van Gaal as Rijkaard’s successor, he wiped Cruyff’s plan off the table and presented his own, prescribing in fine detail how Dutch coaching should operate. High five! Holland reach the semi-finals of the World Cup under the stewardship of Van Gaal this summer . After the Dutch bid for World Cup qualification ended in failure, Van Gaal went, as did his masterplan. Success: Cruyff as Barcelona manager holds aloft the Cup Winners Cup in 1987 . The feud . hit its peak in 2011 when Van Gaal was invited to return to Ajax as . general director, at a time when Cruyff, as club commissioner, had seen . his recommendation of winger Tscheu La Ling rejected. The other board . members, knowing that Cruyff would not agree to Van Gaal’s return, . organised a meeting while he was in Barcelona tocelebrate his daughter . Chantal’s birthday. Cruyff . made sly digs and refused to work with the notebook-wielding Van Gaal. Cruyff said: ‘Van Gaal has a good vision of football but it is not mine. He wants to gel winning teams and has a militaristic way of working . with his tactics. I don’t. I want individuals to think for themselves.’ And Cruyff was just as critical of Van Gaal’s plans for the youth  education system. ‘You  judge football players intuitively and with your heart,’ he said. ‘On the basis of the criteria which are now in use at Ajax I would have failed the test. ‘When I was 15, I could barely kick the ball 15 metres with my left and with the right maybe 20 metres. I would not have been able to take a corner. I was physically weak and relatively slow. My two qualities were great technique and insight, which happen to be two things you can’t measure with a computer.’ After the appointment of Van Gaal as technical director, Cruyff filed a lawsuit. The court ruled against him but legal action went on and,  ultimately, he got his way - Van Gaal’s return never happened.The two men are still not on speaking terms.

"Convicted rapist Ched Evans is engaged to his girlfriend just two weeks after he was released from prison, it emerged today. The former Sheffield United and Wales striker was released from Wymott prison, Lancashire earlier this month after serving half of a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old girl in his hometown of Rhyl, Wales. He has now proposed to fiancée Natasha Massey, who has led the campaign against his conviction, it was reported today. Ched Evans is to marry his fiancée Natasha Massey after proposing shortly after he was released from prison, where he served half of a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old girl . Ms Massey, who has continued to protest Evans's innocence since he was convicted of the crime, was seen wearing a ring in a recent video the footballer made in which he claimed he was only guilty of infidelity . Ms Massey appeared alongside Evans in a recent video he made, in which he insisted he was guilty only of infidelity - not the rape he was jailed for. In the video, Evans apologised to Ms Massey, who he described as 'the woman I love with all my heart'. He said: 'I've constantly regretted my act of infidelity and the damage that has been done on so many fronts because of it. 'The support that's been shown by Natasha, our friends and family during the trial and the time spent in prison has kept me strong. 'It can't have been an easy thing to stand by someone who the court found guilty of such a destructive act. I will be forever grateful. 'Even though I've been released from prison I'm determined to continue to fight to clear my name.' Ms Massey appeared to be wearing an 'engagement' ring in the video, but it is now believed to have been a 'commitment ring' Evans gave her while he was in prison. The Sun reported this morning that Evans had not wanted to propose while he was in jail, but planned to asked Ms Massey to marry him as soon as he was freed. A source told the paper Ms Massey was 'over the moon' and 'smiling from ear to ear'. It is thought Evans, pictured with Ms Massey before he was convicted, did not want to propose from jail . Ms Massey, pictured with Evans last week, is said to be 'over the moon' after he proposed to her . Ms Massey has continued to protest Evans's innocence since he was convicted of rape in April 2012. Shortly before his release earlier this month, she wrote on the ChedEvans.com website: 'Not a minute passes when I don't think about Ched, his mental and physical strength is admirable and keeps us all positive. 'When Ched is released the fight to clear his name will continue, however long it takes this is one fight we will not lose. 'My boyfriend was wrongly convicted and we are doing everything in our power to clear his name.' She later told ITV's This Morning: ‘As soon as I found out that he’d been questioned over rape, my instinct was kind of protective of Ched, and I thought I have to stand by him. ‘So my thoughts and feelings over the cheating were put to one side and I just stepped in to help him through this terrible time. ‘I know Ched and I knew he wouldn’t be capable of committing a crime like that.’ Ms Massey, pictured on ITV's This Morning, said she put thoughts of Evans's infidelity 'to one side' Evans had been serving at HMP Wymott prison in Lancashire but was released earlier this month . Evans's own family have criticised his lack of remorse, with his aunt Nina Evans, 56, urging him to apologise to his victim. She said: ‘He deserved to go down as he was found guilty - he did rape her.’ His victim's father has also spoken out, demanding an apology from the footballer. He said: ‘He’s shown no remorse and every time he makes some fresh appeal or comment, he draws attention to my daughter and risks her being identified and found. ‘She went into hiding because people were trying to track her down and kill her.' The Criminal Cases Review Commission is currently examining Evans's case  as part of his hopes to launch an appeal. He has not been re-signed by his former club or any other team since his release.","Welsh footballer jailed for five years in 2012 for raping 19-year-old woman .

"China’s first gay dating app Blued has just secured a whooping £18.9 million investment, simultaneously taking it’s total valuation to £189 million and making it the most popular gay dating app in the world. With an average of 15 million yearly users, most of whom live in China, it has usurped popular app Grindr which has an average of six million yearly users. David Chao, co-founder and general partner at DCM Ventures who made the investment in Blued says that he thinks the app is a great move for the gay community in China. (Left) Gay men, Lu Zhong and Liu Wangqiang, pose as they shoot their wedding photos in Quanzhou, south Chinas Fujian province. (right) What you could expect to see if you log on to Blued . ‘People [in China] are more in the closet and less open about it [homosexuality], but the beautiful thing about the smartphone is that it’s a private device,' he said. ‘Having a very private phone and being able to communicate with the gay community is a dream come true.’ Lu Zhong and Liu Wangqiang are out and proud: It was only in 1997 that homosexuality was legalised in China . The app actually boasts a similar user interface to Grindr allowing the user to scroll through thumbnail shots of potential suitors before clicking on them to send them a message. They are apparently going to use the new funding to expand the app into different countries. They are also planning to offer a premium paying service. Tinder, similarly recently announced plans to develop the app adding in paid for services and an 'undo' button in case you accidentally swipe left for someone you don't fancy. It was only relatively recently that homosexuality began to become more acceptable with in the Chinese community. Up until 1997 it was completely illegal and it was only in 2001 that it was removed from the Ministry of Health's list of mental illnesses. However, it is thought that there is still wide ranging discrimination and harassment of gay people in China. There are no laws in place to help with or prevent this. Dating apps are now part of everyday life but how do you know which one is going to find you your perfect match? We give you the lowdown so you know which app to download... Tinder . Tinder became incredibly popular in 2013 and recent research claims that the app now matches 10million new potential couples every single day. The app works by showing you a series of profiles with a set of pictures and a short description. Swipe left if you're not interested, swipe right if you are. If it's a match Tinder will let you know and you can get talking. Happn . Happn was originally launched in Paris and works by showing you people you have crossed paths with. So if you're looking to get chatting to the tube crush you were just too shy to talk to this could be the app for you. Scroll down through the app and click the heart symbol for the people you like, if they like you back it's a Crush and you can message each other. Grindr . Gay dating app Grindr is hugely popular in the UK and the United States. It shows you thumbnail shots of men who are nearby even telling you how close they are. You can chat away to the people you do like and if you find someone you don't, well, there's a block function for that too! Which app is the app for you?

"Nestor Ortigoza scored the most important penalty in San Lorenzo's 106-year history as the Argentine side won South America's Libertadores Cup for the first time with a 2-1 aggregate victory over Paraguay's Nacional on Wednesday. Midfielder Ortigoza's first-half spotkick gave San Lorenzo a 1-0 home win after the teams, who had never before reached the final, drew 1-1 in the first leg in Asuncion last week. 'The Saints', who qualified for the Club World Cup with the win, have finally managed to shake off the tag of being the only one of Argentina's 'Big Five' never to have won the trophy. Champions: The San Lorenzo squad celebrate winning the South America Libertadores Cup for the first time . Joy: The Argentinian side San Lorenzo defeated Nacional from Paraguay 2-1 on aggregate in the final . Century wait: It's taken San Lorenzo their 106 year-history to reach the final, let alone win the Libertadores Cup . 'They put their trust in me and I thank them for that,"" Ortigoza said of his coach and team mates. The victory also gave Argentina a record 23rd title in South America's top club competition since it was first played in 1960. It was also the first time in five years that it was not won by a Brazilian team. A Paraguayan side finished runners-up for the second year in a row after three-times champions Olimpia lost to Atletico Mineiro in 2013. Winner: Nestor Ortigoza scored the decisive goal from the penalty spot as San Lorenzo won the second leg 1-0 . Celebration: The San Lorenzo fans swarm the Estadio Pedro Bidegain pitch after their side triumphed . 'We played a very poor first half, the team were very nervous, tense, they were affected by the expectations of the crowd, but luckily we won,"" said San Lorenzo manager Edgardo Bauza. It was Bauza's second Libertadores success after steering LDU Quito to Ecuador's first title in 2008. That success persuaded the San Lorenzo board to appoint Bauza after league-winning coach Juan Antonio Pizzi quit in December to take charge of Valencia. Elation: San Lorenzo players realise what they've achieved by finally winning the Libertadores Cup for the club . The competition, which began with a preliminary knockout round at the end of January, ended with the new season already underway having been held up for two months between the quarter-finals and semi-finals of the World Cup in Brazil. It had been a struggle for San Lorenzo to keep key players in their squad as some of them were out of contract by the end of June. Attacking midfielder Ignacio Piatti was granted permission by his new club, Montreal Impact of the MLS, to play up to the first leg of the final but he was absent for the second leg on Wednesday. Nacional started brightly and came close in the first minute when San Lorenzo midfielder Juan Mercier lost the ball inside the box and Derlis Orue fired against the post. San Lorenzo replied with a long range drive from right back Julio Buffarini that went over the bar before Nacional midfielder Silvio Torales forced Saints goalkeeper Sebastian Torrico into a difficult save in the 18th minute. Gutted: Some of the Nacional players struggled to hide their disappointment after coming so close to the title . San Lorenzo were struggling to find some rhythm in the face of Nacional's quick counter-attacks but were awarded a penalty in the 36th minute when defender Ramon Coronel handled the ball. Ortigoza made no mistake from the spot, blasting the ball home as Nacional goalkeeper Ignacio Don dived the wrong way. The goal, celebrated wildly by the Saints fans in a crowd of more than 40,000 at a packed Nuevo Gasometro, gave San Lorenzo the impetus and they pinned Nacional back for the remainder of the first half. The home side began finding more space in the second half as Nacional took greater risks at the back in search of an equaliser, with visiting midfielder Marcos Riveros coming close in the 65th minute and striker Fredy Bareiro in the 78th. San Lorenzo fans have attributed their success to the anointing last year of Argentine-born Pope Francis, a fan and club member, winning the league title in December and now the South American crown.","Argentine side San Lorenzo defeated Paraguay's Nacional to lift the South America Libertadores Cup for the first time in their 106-year history .

"In the minutes after Manchester City’s 5-1 thumping of Tottenham, Manuel Pellegrini was asked about the ethics of paying £233m in salaries. ‘I don’t know what you’re telling me, but after the game is not the time to talk about other things,’ he claimed. In other words, Manchester City’s manager isn’t interested in pay packets and FFP. Pellegrini has been brought in to win trophies with this team. Feed The Beast... Alvaro Negredo has become a fans' favourite at the Etihad Stadium . Manchester City have scored 115 goals so far this season in all competitions - so could they really score 200 by the end of it? UNTIL NOW . 115 goals in 37 games, which is 3.1 goals per game . TO GO . 15 Premier League games . Capital One Cup final . Four potential FA Cup matches (not inc replays) Seven potential Champions League matches . Total: 27 . So if they continue at their current rate, they will finish with... 198 goals . Still, if anyone can... Undoubtedly he will do that now that there is equilibrium, charging towards the Barclays Premier League title after another night of shock and awe at White Hart Lane. ‘They are the best team in this league by a country mile,’ was Tim Sherwood’s typically brutal and honest assessment. Tottenham’s manager should know because he has experienced victory at Manchester United and defeat at Arsenal in his opening weeks in charge. Suddenly the pre-season chatter of chief executive Ferran Soriano, when he demanded five trophies in five years from City’s new manager, seems cautious. They look and feel as though they could clean up as they go about their business, targeting a Quadruple after banging in 115 goals. Before the season is out, they could yet reach 200. Chelsea are next, the team who beat them in the final minute at Stamford Bridge when Joe Hart came haring out of his penalty area on October 27. Much has changed since then. They have settled down, utilising the talents of Jesus Navas, David Silva, Sergio Aguero and Alvaro Negredo during this jaw-dropping season.  Navas and Silva were exceptional at Spurs, grandmasters when it comes to one touch football of either boot.  On Wednesday, as they darted past Mousa Dembele, Nabil Bentaleb, Aaron Lennon and Gylfi Sigurdsson, it was easy to become transfixed by them. Footballing centre half? Vincent Kompany has notched up three goals this season for City . Mastermind: Manuel Pellegrini has moulded his team into a scoring machine . Me again: Sergio Aguero was among the goals again as he opened the scoring against Tottenham . City's 115 goals have come from 12 different players this season. Unsurprisingly, strikers Sergio Aguero and Alvaro Negredo are leading the way but the midfielders have been pulling their weight too - most notably, Yaya Toure has netted 15 times already. Centre back and captain Vincent Kompany is among the goals as well, scoring three times from defence. He isn't the highest-scoring defender at City though. Aleksandar Kolarov has four goals from left back. 1. Sergio Aguero 26 . 2. Alvaro Negredo 23 . 3. Edin Dzeko 17 . 4. Yaya Toure 15 . 5. Jesus Navas 5 . 6. Samir Nasri 5 . 7. David Silva 5 . 8. Aleksandar Kolarov 4 . 9. Fernandinho 3 . 10. Stevan Jovetic 3 . 11. Vincent Kompany 3 . 12. James Milner 2 . City are top, striding clear of Arsenal and Chelsea after their magnificent performance at Spurs. It will be difficult to topple them now. They are so powerful, using 22 players in their Capital One Cup run alone, but the Premier League is the principle target for these players. ‘If you want to challenge for titles we have to be ready for the weeks and months when there are important matches,’ admitted Navas. ‘We are top of the table and on Monday we have a really important match against Chelsea. ‘Obviously there is pressure. We want to win the title, but there is nothing to worry about. ‘We are enjoying it a lo, not only the players, but the fans as well.’ The 3,000 or so who made the long trip down to London on Wednesday know they are witnessing something special at City. The antagonism established among players and management under Roberto Mancini has been replaced by a special bond on the sidelines. After the opening goal on Wednesday, when Sergio Aguero put City in front after 15 minutes, the management team all celebrated together. They knew as early as then that they were heading for the top of the table and few will be able to live with them in the remaining 15 matches of the Premier League season. There is an aura about them now and on Monday night, when Chelsea arrive in town, City have their 100 per cent home record at the Etihad to protect in the league. Goal feast: It isn't just the strikers who have been converting their chances this season . Powerhouse: Left back Aleksandar Kolarov blasted home during the FA Cup clash with Watford . Cool as you like: Toure blasted his penalty home against Tottenham during the 5-1 thumping . They are a free-scoring team, putting 11 past the France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris in two chastening experiences for Tottenham. ‘The difference between City last season and this season is that every player is playing for the team,’ claimed Lloris. ‘When you have a squad like that, with that quality, everybody is thinking about the team, and the have the potential to win the Champions League. For me they should be the winners of the League.’ On Monday evening, when Mourinho pitches up, we get to find out what City are really made of.

"Is it a pineapple? Is it a strawberry? No, this is the latest exotic fruit to grace our shelves – the ‘pineberry’. Discovered growing wild in South America, the fruit, pictured, has been rescued from extinction by Dutch farmers. It is said to combine a flavour and smell like a pineapple’s with the shape and texture of a strawberry. It starts off green, gradually turning paler as it ripens. Scroll down for video . The pineberry, which could be set to grace our shelves after being saved from extinction by Dutch farmers . They were rescued from extinction by Dutch farmers, they are now being sold in some independent greengrocers in time for Christmas, given their ‘festive colouring’. Greengrocer, Pinder Dayal, from Fresh Choice in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, who took delivery of her first order of pineberries last week said: ‘We’ve already sold 30 punnets – our customers are buying them because they’re intrigued – and they taste great too. 'You can really taste the pineapple.’ Despite their unusual smell and taste, pineberries have the same genetic make-up as the common strawberry. The snow-white berries – that to an uninformed shopper may look more like an under-ripe strawberry - are smaller than most commercially grown strawberries, measuring between 15 and 23mm across, slightly less than an inch. It is their fresh, juicy, sweet and acid flavour with a highly aromatic smell – more akin to a pineapple – that inspired the name. The berry is said to taste like a pineapple, pictured, but have the shape and texture of a strawberry . Dutch growers, Beekers Berries, began exporting pineberries to our shores last month along with another strawberry variety known as the ‘strasberry’, which tastes like a raspberry crossed with a strawberry. ‘The strasberries only came in yesterday and people are already showing a lot of interest in those too,’ Miss Dayal said. ‘We ordered the pineberries and strasberries as soon as our supplier told us about them – we’d have bought them years ago if we could.’ Both varieties are expected to be available from specialist shops until mid to late December. In the Spring of 2010, Waitrose trialled the fruit for five weeks, to mixed-reviews. Some complaints from shoppers included that they were ‘watery’ or ‘too sweet’.","The pineberry was discovered growing in the wild in South America .

"Mohammed Karani, 44, has been jailed for 11 months after his van rolled down a steep hill and crushed a mother-of-four to death . A driver has been jailed for 11 months after his runaway van rolled down a hill and crushed a mother-of-four as she tried to protect her three young daughters. Simran Ahmed, 46, was walking her children home from school when the Ford Transit Connect ploughed into the family in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire. Electrician Mohammed Karani, 44, left his vehicle 'in a neutral position' with the handbrake 'only partially applied' while carrying out maintenance work in a building on a notoriously steep road. Mrs Ahmed died at the scene and her 11-year-old daughter Kiran was left with a fractured skull, Leeds Crown Court heard. Karani from Batley, West Yorkshire, was unanimously found guilty by a jury last month of causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving in April last year. During sentencing on Thursday, Judge Christopher Batty said: 'This is a very sad day. The lives of two families were changed forever on that date in April. 'The cause of this tragic accident was the negligent way you left your vehicle before getting out of it. You had engaged the handbrake only to the second notch out of a possible six, you had not engaged a gear, you had not turned your wheels towards the kerb as advised by the Highway Code when parking. 'Of course there is no way you intended what happened or foresaw what would happen but this was a serious error.' Mrs Ahmed's husband, Waquar Ahmed Ghafoor, said the family are appalled by the length of the sentence. He said: 'It's absolutely shocking. We are all very disappointed that the jail sentence was not longer. I have lost a wife and all our children have lost a mother. There's no price on a life, a life is a life. 'We are all teaming up and putting a brave face on, so we are trying to be strong. But we are appalled at the judge's decision. 'The children all still have nightmares. She shielded two of my daughters and one was very badly injured. And one had to go through the pain of her dying while lying on her lap.' The judge added: 'No sentence will ever bring Simran Ahmed back, no sentence will ever compensate her family for their immeasurable loss.' Karani had been carrying out electrical work at the Medina Academy - an Islamic education centre - when the unattended van began to reverse down the hill, the court heard. Simran Ahmed, 46, was walking her children home from school when the Ford Transit Connect ploughed into her and left her daughter Kiran (right) with a fractured skull . It picked up speed until it reached about 15mph, careering across the road and crushing Mrs Ahmed against a wall and seriously injuring her daughter. Her other two daughters, eight-year-old Mariyam and 10-year-old Mariyah, were not seriously injured. Garage owner Majeed Abdul, who was talking to customers on the forecourt of the garage facing the scene, described in a statement read to the court: 'I did think it was a strange manoeuvre as it was in the middle of the road. The next thing I remember was a girl screaming.' Eyewitness Margaret Dylan, who was speaking to the garage owner, said: 'I saw the manager's facial expression and then I heard screams. I looked around and saw an adult female and two young children on the floor. Daughters Mariyam (bottom), Mariyah (left), and Kiran Ahmed (right) narrowly avoided being killed in the crash . Mariyam suffered a serious injury to her leg and her father Waquar Ahmed Ghafoor says all the girl still have nightmares about the accident . 'The van was facing to the top of the hill. I am trained in first aid and primary care and I ran across the road, stopping the traffic, where I saw a female lying on on the floor with a child stood next to her.' Prosecutor Stephen Wood said: 'There was no defect to the van in any of its systems which could have caused or contributed to the van setting off in the way it did - in other words, it was mechanically sound. The weather was fine and dry - there were no defects in the road surface.' An investigator had later returned Karani's van to the scene and applied the brake, finding it was easily able to hold the van in position, the court heard. The electrician had been carrying out maintenance work in a building on a notoriously steep road in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire . In evidence Karani insisted he had pulled the brake on as far as it would go which had kept the vehicle stationary for 43 minutes. He could not remember if the vehicle was left in gear but that was what he usually did. Andrew Dallas, representing him, said he had a wife and six children who were heavily reliant on him as well as an elderly mother. He was highly regarded in the community giving his time to the mosque and in fundraising particularly for disaster relief abroad and had expressed sincere remorse for what had happened. Karani was also disqualified from driving for 12 months.","Simran Ahmed, 46, was crushed as she tried to protect her three daughters .

"Courage: Lance Corporal James Ashworth is only the tenth British soldier to be awarded the Victoria Cross since the Second World War . The British soldier awarded the Victoria Cross for extraordinary courage died after killing three Taliban fighters at close-quarters when he became cut off from his colleagues, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Lance Corporal James Ashworth, of Kettering, Northants, was leading a 25-man reconnaissance patrol through an enemy-occupied village in Helmand Province last June when they were attacked by insurgents firing rifles and rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs). He responded by charging towards the mud huts where the Taliban were taking cover. By deliberately offering himself as a target, he distracted their attention from his colleagues marching in single file behind. This action, and an incredible last stand that followed, persuaded senior officers to recommend the soldier – known by his friends as a  ‘gentle giant’ – for the Victoria Cross, Britain’s highest medal for gallantry. Having repelled a succession of attacks by Taliban fighters, L/Cpl Ashworth, 23, of 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards, found himself isolated and outnumbered. But he took on the insurgents as they advanced. However, he stood no chance when a grenade was launched towards his position. After the battle, his body was recovered from the village in Nahr-e Saraj district to Camp Bastion, the main British base in Helmand. Later that day, Grenadiers officers met to discuss his citation. A regimental source said last night: ‘L/Cpl Ashworth’s bravery was so exemplary that support for his VC nomination was unanimous. Tribute: The repatriation ceremony for Lance Corporal James Ashworth after he died in Afghanistan last June . Valour: Colleagues said Lance Corporal James Ashworth showed extraordinary courage to protect his comrades during the firefight in Afghanistan (file photo) Last night, his father Duane Ashworth, . a former Grenadier who runs a holiday park in Eastchurch, Kent, said: . ‘We are all immensely proud of what James has done and what he’s . achieved as a brother, son and uncle. ‘There are conflicting stories of what . happened when he was killed and we are waiting for the full details to . emerge at his inquest.’ Friends also paid tribute to him. Bar worker . Richard Miller, 23, said: ‘It is still very difficult to accept he’s . gone, but this award brings some comfort. ‘I am not surprised that James was . leading the way because he was a very brave man who always put others . before himself. I used to call him the gentle giant because he was huge . but always so friendly.’ Roofer Liam Black, 23, added: ‘I am . really proud of James’s Victoria Cross. When I found out what happened I . could just imagine him putting himself at risk for his mates.’ L/Cpl Ashworth, joined the Army in . 2006 aged 17. Following basic training at Catterick, he joined the . Grenadiers’ Nijmegen company and began ceremonial duties in London. After serving in the Guards Parachute Platoon, he transferred to the . Grenadier Guards’ Reconnaissance Platoon. He died halfway through his . second tour of duty in Afghanistan. The Victoria Cross for ‘most . conspicuous bravery’ has been awarded just ten times since the Second . World War, with this VC only the second from the conflict in . Afghanistan. Unique: The Victoria Cross medal is cast from the metal of Russian guns captured during the Crimean War . The Victoria Cross ranks as the nation's highest award for gallantry, along with the George Cross. Instituted by Queen Victoria in 1856, the Victoria Cross is awarded for 'most conspicuous bravery, or some daring or pre-eminent act of valour or self-sacrifice, or extreme devotion to duty in the presence of the enemy.' The bronze cross, which has a crimson ribbon bears the inscription 'For Valour', is cast from the metal of Russian guns captured at the siege of Sevastopol during the Crimean War, the campaign in which the first medals were awarded. The Victoria Cross may be awarded to all ranks of the services - and also to civilians - to recognise gallantry in the presence of the enemy. The medal has been awarded 1,356 times, the most recent of which was a posthumous award to Corporal Bryan Budd, of the 3rd Battalion The Parachute Regiment, for acts of ""inspirational leadership and the greatest valour"" in southern Afghanistan in 2006. Only 13 Victoria Cross medals have been awarded since the Second World War, nine to members of the British Army and four to the Australian Army. L/Cpl Ashworth's is just the fifth to have been awarded since the Falklands conflict, and all but one have been posthumous. Private Johnson Beharry, from 1st Battalion the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment, was awarded the honour for two separate acts of outstanding gallantry to rescue his comrades in Iraq in 2004, during which suffered serious head injuries. The Victoria Cross has been awarded to the same person twice on three occasions - to doctors Captain Arthur Martin-Leake (1902 and 1914) and Captain Noel Chavasse (1916 and posthumously 1917), and New Zealander Captain Charles Upham (1941 and 1942). The George Cross, which stands equal to the Victoria Cross as an award, recognises acts of gallantry by members of the Armed Forces or civilians in situations for which the Victoria Cross is not appropriate. These can be incidents that are not in the presence of the enemy, such as bomb or mine disposal.","Lance Corporal James Ashworth given nation's highest honour for bravery .

"Pupils from poor homes do worse at university than richer youngsters with the same A-level grades despite attempts to boost their numbers, research has found. The study – published today by the Institute for Fiscal Studies – tracked students in England who began studying at a British university from 2004/5 to 2011/10. Among those who began with similar grades and took the same course, those from the poorest backgrounds were 3.4 percentage points more likely to drop out of their studies within two years of starting them than those from the richest homes. Among those who began with similar grades and took the same course, those from the poorest backgrounds were 3.4 percentage points more likely to drop out of their studies (File photo) And they were 5.3 points less likely to complete their degree within five years and 3.7 points less likely to achieve a first or 2:1. The think-tank’s study may suggest that universities which discriminate in favour of poorer applicants could be unfairly penalising bright middle-class youngsters. But the research also found that pupils from the best-performing comprehensives were two percentage points more likely to drop out and 5.2 points less likely to graduate with a good degree than youngsters from weak schools with the same A-level grades. The findings may lead to greater use of schemes that involve universities making lower offers to pupils from poor-performing schools or giving them priority in admissions. It could mean that applicants from private schools, grammars and high-performing comprehensives could find it harder to get into elite universities unwilling to expand their overall numbers. A range of targets are currently used by universities to meet Government demands to widen the social mix of undergraduates, including boosting recruitment from deprived postcodes, state schools and the lowest social classes. The new research – published today by the Institute for Fiscal Studies – tracked students in England who began studying at a UK university between 2004/5 and 2011/10. Researchers found that in general, students from the most disadvantaged homes were 8.4 percentage points more likely to drop out of university within two years of starting their course . Researchers found that in general, students from the most disadvantaged homes were 8.4 percentage points more likely to drop out of university within two years of starting their course, compared to those from the most advantaged backgrounds. They were also 13.3 percentage points less likely to complete their degree within five years, and 22.9 points less likely to graduate with a first or 2.1. There were still ‘significant’ differences even when a student’s own grades are taken into account, the study found. Among students who began university with similar grades and took the same degree course, those from the poorest backgrounds were still 3.4 percentage points more likely to drop out of their studies than those from the richest homes. And they were still 5.3 points less likely to complete their degree and 3.7 points less likely to achieve a first or 2.1. The researchers said the finding that youngsters from disadvantaged backgrounds do less well on average than wealthier peers – even when they have similar prior achievement – suggested that poor students may need extra support at university to enable them to succeed. The study also questioned the increasing use of ‘contextual’ data in university admissions which solely considers a candidate’s social background. ‘While, on average, students from less good schools go on to outperform students with similar grades from better schools, the same is not true of students from poorer backgrounds with the same grades as those from richer backgrounds,’ the report said. ‘Universities interested in using contextual data to inform their admissions policies may therefore wish to focus on school characteristics rather than individual or neighbourhood measures of disadvantage to identify students who, on average, are likely to go on to perform well.’ The study found that pupils from the best-performing comprehensives were actually two percentage points more likely to drop out and 5.2 points less likely to graduate with a good degree than youngsters from weak schools with the same A-level grades. This may mean that students from poorly-performing state schools have higher ‘potential’ than those who went to top schools. The report suggests that ‘university entry requirements could be lowered for pupils from poorly-performing state schools in order to equalise the potential of all students being admitted to university, on average’. The paper added: ‘The same does not appear to hold, on average, for individuals from different socio-economic backgrounds, however: those from lower socio-economic backgrounds remain, on average, more likely to drop-out, less likely to complete their degree and less likely to graduate with a first or 2:1 than those from higher socio-economic backgrounds, even once we compare individuals with the same human capital on entry to university. ‘That is not to say that universities should not be using information on individuals’ own socio-economic background to inform their admissions processes; simply that it is more challenging to identify those from lower socio-economic backgrounds with strong potential to succeed.’ Critics claim that lowering entry grades for certain groups risks crude ‘social engineering’ and detracts from attempts to boost academic standards in state schools. But universities in the elite Russell Group have been set a target by the Government’s social mobility tsar Alan Milburn to be admitting 3,000 more students from state schools by 2020 and 1,400 from working-class backgrounds. Ministers announced last year than universities would be freed from strict student number controls from 2015/16, which will give academics more freedom to expand courses rather than choose between closely-matched candidates. But some are concerned that many universities or courses will be unable or unwilling to expand quickly, resulting in unfairness to some well-qualified applicants. Explaining her findings, study author Claire Crawford said: ‘Our research highlights that there are large differences in university outcomes by socio-economic background, a substantial proportion of which can be explained by differences in attainment earlier in the education system. ‘While improving the attainment of students from disadvantaged backgrounds at school is likely to aid their performance at university as well, we find non-negligible differences in university outcomes between students from different socio-economic backgrounds at the same university, studying the same subject, who arrived with the same grades. ‘This suggests that universities may wish to focus on improving the progression and performance of students from disadvantaged backgrounds as well as widening access.’","Poor students on same course as rich ones 3.4 percentage points more likely to drop out .

"When One Direction first appeared on television screens on the X Factor in 2010, they were hailed as the new clean-cut and fresh-faced British answer to Justin Bieber. Although the Harry Styles, Niall Horan. Liam Payne, Zayn Malik and Louis Tomlinson didn't win the talent show, they have gone on to become the franchise's most successful contestants of all time and been credited with making boybands popular again. They are now getting ready to release their fourth studio album - Four. Scroll down for video . Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson, Harry Styles, Liam Payne and Zayn Malik of X Factor's One Direction arrive for an autograph signing session at the HMV store, Bradford in December 2010. Since then, their style has changed dramatically, with their current looked modelled on the likes of Keith Richards, David Beckham and Mick Jagger . One Direction pose for photographs at Wembley Arena as they made the wishes of 60 seriously ill children come true and met the children prior to performing at Wembley Stadium on June 8, 2014 in London . Their popularity means that they have become some of the wealthiest young men in the country - rumoured to have earned £45 million each last year. It has also meant that they are some of the most photographed human beings in the western world - barely a week goes by without their photographs splashed across the world's media. The band's bulging bank balance and worldwide stardom has seen a dramatic change in their image, going from shiny pop stars to cool rockers. Nearly all of the group are now covered in tattoos and Harry Styles and Zayn Malik in particular follow a fashion sense closely modelled on Keith Richards and Mick Jagger from The Rolling Stones. All of the boys are often seen front row at some of the biggest shows during Fashion Week and last year Harry won the Style award at the British Fashion Awards.

"Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly credits Dr Phil with changing her life. Ms Kelly said that he inspired her to leave her high-paying lawyer position for a $17,000 journalism job, at the Fortune Most Powerful Women in Business conference in California on Tuesday. The 43-year-old revealed that a quote from the talk-show host convinced her to adopt a 'settle for more' philosophy with regard to both her career and marriage, during an interview with Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg. Scroll down for video . Settle for more: Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly (pictured on Late Night with Seth Meyers in July) says a quote from Dr Phil inspired her to pursue a more fulfilling career and marriage . 'Back in the day when I was unhappily married and unhappily working, I heard a brilliant man by the name of Dr. Phil say the only difference between you and someone you envy is you settled for less,' Ms Kelly said. 'It just spoke to me like, ""Yes, that's exactly right!"" So, settle for more. That was me.' She went on to explain how she put the newfound philosophy into practice, claiming, 'It really did change my life.' 'Instead of wasting energy sitting around looking at someone who I admired and thinking, ""Oh, God, she's got it all. Why can't I have it all? She's on TV. Oh, I would love that job. She seems so happily married. I wish I were happily married,"" I just started to change my life little by little,' she said. Life changing advice: Dr. Phil (pictured in September) said that 'the only difference between you and someone you envy is you settled for less,' according to Ms Kelly . After nine years as a corporate litigator at the firm Jones Day, she broke into journalism with the help of a female reporter in Chicago she met in guitar class. Ms Kelly served as a general assignment reporter for ABC affiliate WJLA-TV before joining Fox News Channel as a Washington-based correspondent in 2004. She also revealed how Dr Phil's advice helped her seek a more fulfilling personal life. Happy couple: Ms Kelly married husband Douglas Brunt (left) in 2008 . 'I had a very sweet, loving husband who was a doctor, but I knew I wasn't happy and we divorced amicably. And I wound up meeting a man who was unlike any other man I ever met before,' said Ms Kelly, who married author Douglas Brunt in 2008 after her divorce from anesthesiologist Daniel Kendall two years earlier. Ms Kelly's highly rated primetime news program, The Kelly File, debuted a year ago this week. Earlier this year, she was named one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people in the world.","Ms Kelly says a Dr Phil quote inspired her to adopt a 'settle for more' philosophy, which led her to quit law for a more fulfilling job in TV ."
"Jodi Arias' legal defense has cost Arizona taxpayers more than $2.5 million - and the bill will continue to rise as prosecutors try for a second time to convince a jury to sentence her to death. Arias was convicted last year of brutally murdering her ex-lover Travis Alexander, but the jury could not agree on whether to sentence her to death. Prosecutors called for a second jury to re-examine Arias sentence. Jury selection began on Monday. Scroll down for video . Big bucks: It was revealed today that Kirk Nurmi (right) and his co-counsel Jennifer Willmot (center) have billed the state of Arizona more than $2.5million for the legal defense of their client Jodi Arias (left) Arias (left), seen here before her conviction for first-degree murder, put her arm around defense lawyer Jennifer Willmot . Maricopa County spokeswoman Cari Gerchick said Monday that defense lawyers Kirk Nurmi and Jennifer Willmott have billed the state for more than $2.5million for their fees and to pay for expert witnesses and other defense costs. Prosecutors have declined to say how much they have spent on the case. Shortly after Arias' arrest in July 2008, a judge found that she she was found unable to pay for her own defense and ordered that two court-appointed attorneys be hired to defend her. The shocking figure is dramatically higher than other high-profile cases. Casey Anthony's legal defense cost more than $275,000 - and taxpayers kicked in about $119,000 of that. Mass-murderer Robert Stewart, who gunned down eight people in a North Carolina nursing home in 2009, cost the state $338,000 in defense costs - of which $229,000 went to his defense lawyers. Arias was convicted last year of the brutal 2008 murder of her ex-lover Travis Alexander. Prosecutors are trying to convince a jury to sentence her to death . Last year, it emerged that George Zimmerman, who shot dead unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin, says he spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on his defense and still carries a $2.5million debt from legal fees. Last October, after she was convicted of murder, Arias sent the judge in her case a hand-written 12-page letter in which she called Mr Nurmi incompetent and asked to fire him from her defense team. She claimed that he had an 'utter poverty of people skills' and had not provided an effective defense. Arias' charge came despite her defense team sowing enough doubt among jurors in the highly-publicized case that they could not agree to sentence her to death. Prosecutors have one more shot with a new jury to secure the death penalty, otherwise Arias will face life in prison. Jury selection began The case is expected to last into December.","Cost is certain to rise as prosecutors convene a second jury to attempt to have her sentences to death .

"After a week of speculation, Tesla Motors boss Elon Musk has taken the cover off the firm's mysterious 'D' car. During an event at Hawthorne Airport in Los Angeles, Mr Musk took to the stage to announce that the 'D' stands for 'dual motor.' The current Model S is a rear-wheel-drive car with one motor. The 'D' will have two motors - one powering the front wheels and one powering the rear wheels. Scroll down for video . During an event at Hawthorne Airport in Los Angeles, Mr Musk (pictured) took to the stage to announce that the 'D' stands for 'dual motor.' The current Model S is a rear-wheel-drive car with one motor. The 'D' will have two motors - one powering the front wheels and one powering the rear wheels . More than 1,000 Tesla fans attended the unveiling. Mr Musk said unlike all-wheel-drive systems on gas-powered cars, which tend to be heavy and make the cars less efficient, Tesla's system 'improves the speed, acceleration and mileage by optimising which motor is used'. The dual motor version of the P85 performance sedan will have a top speed of 155 mph (249 km/h), compared with the current 130 mph (209 km/h). It will accelerate from 0 to 60mph (96km/h) in 3.2 seconds, akin to sports cars. 'This car is nuts. It's like taking off from a carrier deck,' Musk said at the the airport, where the Mr Musk's rocket firm SpaceX is based. After Musk left the stage, the audience was shown demonstrations of the car's acceleration and safety features. Mr Musk said 'auto pilot' does not mean that the car could drive itself - as he put it, a driver cannot 'safely fall asleep.' Although, he said, on private property - not public roads - a driver could summon the car remotely . The current Model S is a rear-wheel-drive car with one motor.

It will accelerate from 0 to 60mph (96km/h) in 3.2 seconds, akin to sports cars. Tesla is also significantly upgrading the model's safety features. The Model S will steer itself back if it wanders from its lane and brake automatically if it is about to hit something. Its new system will also move the car over a lane when the driver uses the turn signal. It will also use cameras to read speed limit signs and decelerate accordingly. Volvo has a system that reads signs and alert drivers if they are over the limit, but does not change the speed. Mr Musk said 'auto pilot' does not mean that the car could drive itself - as he put it, a driver cannot 'safely fall asleep.' Although, he said, on private property - not public roads - a driver could summon the car remotely. The dual motor will be a $4,000 (£2,480) option on the base and mid-range Model S, which start at $71,000 (£44,100). The base price for the P85 with all-wheel drive - which will be known as P85D - is $120,000 (£74,400). The cars went on sale immediately on Tesla's website; the P85D will be delivered beginning in December, while the other versions begin delivery in February. The all-wheel-drive system helps grip slippery roads, and analysts have said Tesla needed it to boost sales in the Northeast and Midwest, as well as Europe. The company sold 13,850 cars in the U.S. this year through September, down three per cent from a year ago, according to Autodata. Tesla is also significantly upgrading its safety features. The Model S will steer itself back if it wanders from its lane and brake automatically if it is about to hit something.

Mr Musk teased the announcement on Twitter last week, saying: 'About time to unveil the D and something else'. The image (pictured) resembled the front of a Model S, which led to correct predictions that the announcement would be an update to an existing model . While the addition of all-wheel drive catches Tesla up with others in the luxury car market, pulling together all the driver-assist features impressed Brian Johnson, an analyst with Barclay's. 'It's a year ahead of the timeframe I was expecting,' he said. Raj Rajkumar, a pioneer of self-driving cars with Carnegie Mellon University, was similarly impressed but wondered about the limitations of 'auto-pilot' - how would it perform in different weather and road conditions. Currently, Tesla has about 100 'Supercharger' stations scattered across North America and Europe that give Model S drivers a free power source when traveling long distances. The technology is designed to replenish about half of the battery power within 20 minutes. Tesla recently opened three Supercharger stations in China and plans to set up about 200 more around the world, including Japan, by the end of the year.

Mr Musk teased the announcement on Twitter last week, saying: 'About time to unveil the D and something else.' But when internet commenters revealed that 'the D' had some rather rude connotations, Musk let slip some more information. 'I love the Internet. Comments had me literally ROFL. No, it wasn't intentional. Glad I didn't mention the other letter!' Pictured is a black 2010 Bugatti Veyron on a rural road in England. The Bugatti Veyron has a top speed of 252.97mph (407.12km/h). It was named Top Gear's Car of the Decade from 2000 to 2009. It goes from 0 to 60 in 2.46 seconds .

"A motorist who drove eight miles down a motorway in the wrong direction before colliding with a police car has been jailed. A video released by Hertfordshire Police shows Luke Goodall, 26, driving the wrong way down the A1(M) near Stevenage before crashing into a police car which was blocking the road. Goodall, from Southampton, admitted dangerous driving and failing to provide a specimen and was today sentenced to eight months in prison and banned from driving for three years. Scroll down for video . Luke Goodall, 26, was seen driving the wrong way down the A1(M), near Stevenage, for eight miles before colliding with a police car . A video released by Hertfordshire Police shows Goodall, from Southampton, driving the wrong way down the road before colliding with the police car . Sergeant Karl McDermott positioned his police car in the way of Goodall's Ford Fiesta to bring him to a halt . Goodall was seen driving a silver Ford Fiesta south along the northbound carriageway at junction 7 of the motorway at 1.40am on August 7. He narrowly avoided crashing into several vehicles heading in the opposite direction before police arrived. Sergeant Karl McDermott was about to set up a rolling roadblock when Goodall arrived, slowing down before colliding with the police car, bringing the Fiesta to a stop. The video shows Sgt McDermott driving the correct way along the motorway when a pair of headlights appear on the horizon - on the wrong side of the central reservation. The brave officer slows down, quickly positioning himself in front of Goodall's vehicle before carefully shunting the car, bringing it to a halt. With Goodall seemingly unaware of what has happened, Sgt McDermott runs from the police car and drags the offender out of the car. The video shows Sgt McDermott dashing out of his vehicle and dragging Goodall from the car . Goodall was later arrested and was today jailed for eight months for dangerous driving and failing to provide a specimen. He was also disqualified from driving for three years . Meanwhile other officers put a road block on the carriageway to reduce further risk of a collision and Goodall was later arrested on suspicion of drink driving and dangerous driving. As well as being disqualified from driving for three years, Goodall will also have to take an extended driving test before being able to get behind the wheel again. Sgt McDermott said: 'Despite the time of night there was still fast-moving traffic on the motorway and the darkness meant drivers had minimal time to avoid the oncoming vehicle. 'I would like to take this opportunity to thank the many witnesses who came forward to provide evidence in this case. It is clear that a number of drivers were left in genuine fear for their lives after describing how Goodall only missed them by inches. 'Goodall is extremely lucky that he did not cause a serious collision that could have resulted in people getting killed or seriously injured. At the time he had no regard for how much danger he was in.' Sentencing Goodall at St Albans Crown Court, Judge Michael Baker commended Sgt McDermott for his 'significant and brave actions in bringing [Goodall] to a stop'. Inspector Phil Bloor said: 'In some circumstances and always as a last resort when there is an immediate risk to life – as was the case in this incident – the only way to stop a dangerous driver is to put a physical barrier in their way. 'In this case I am certain that the actions of Sgt McDermott and other road policing officers on that night were all that stopped a serious collision from happening. 'The driver was removed from his car for his own safety. Given where the cars were stopped – the fast lane of a motorway – it was imperative that officers acted quickly to arrest him and remove the danger to the public, to themselves and to Goodall himself. 'I hope video footage brings home some of the dangers present on our roads and the lengths police officers will go to keep them safe for everybody.'","Luke Goodall drove wrong way down a motorway before hitting police car .

"This is the dramatic moment a team of FBI agents trick their way into a Las Vegas casino hotel room to smash a suspected Triad illegal gambling ring - by dressing up as computer repairmen. The suspects were holed up in a luxury villa at the world-famous Caesars Palace casino where they had numerous computers set up which the feds believed were being used to place illegal bets. To trick their way in the agents cut off internet access to the room and then dressed as the casino's computer technicians so they would be invited in to try and fix the problem. Once inside they used hidden lapel cameras to film the scene, collecting footage of laptop screens showing lists of betting odds which they now hope can be used to help secure a conviction. The video shows investigators devising code words to use while they were inside, a back-and-forth about the cover story for an agent, who adopted the name 'Sam,' which he had used 'for other stuff' in the past, and a brief exchange about how another investigator should dress for the role of a technical repair nerd. 'If you put on that shirt, you have to look the part. Go all the way,' said Mike Wood, an outside technician working for Caesars, advising Nevada Gaming Control Board Agent Ricardo Lopez before Lopez headed to one of the suites the morning of July 4. The AP obtained about 30 minutes of audio and video recordings of the covert reconnaissance recorded over two days. On another visit to a villa on July 5, Lopez appeared to try to fix an Internet outage for several minutes while glancing around the room and asking more than once to view a laptop screen to verify that Internet connectivity was still down. Defense lawyers said in their filing that Mike Kung, the FBI agent, was sent inside because he spoke Chinese. Still undercover, Lopez appeared to call Wood from inside the villa and asked him to 'check the frame,' the code they had previously worked out. In a brief back and forth, Wood responded that he would 'trace the wire and make sure it's tied down good.' Defense lawyer Thomas Goldstein, who is challenging evidence the government collected in what he described as an illegal search, said that was code to turn Internet access back on. After the agents left the villa, Lopez was recorded saying he saw the Internet address of the website that defendant Wei Seng Phua was operating, adding, 'Phua had the odds up on his page the whole time.' Federal authorities described Phua, 50, as a high-ranking member of the 14k Triad, a Chinese organized crime group. Goldstein said Phua denied that allegation, which he said had nothing to do with the criminal case in Nevada. Phua, his son Darren Wai Kit Phua, Seng Chen Yong, Wai Kin Yong and four others were arrested in July after federal agents raided three high-roller villas at the hotel. All eight face charges of transmission of wagering information, operating an illegal gambling business, and aiding and abetting. None of defendants has entered a plea, but Goldstein said they all deny wrongdoing. Phua also faces charges of running an illegal sports gambling business in Macau. He was arrested in the Chinese gambling enclave on June 18 and flew to Las Vegas a few days later. The FBI employed the ruse against the recommendation of an assistant U.S. attorney, Kimberly Frayn, according to defense lawyers. They filed a 54-page motion late Tuesday night in federal court in Las Vegas to dismiss evidence in the case. According to a conversation recorded by an investigator for the hotel, the prosecutor told FBI agents 'it was a consent issue,' the lawyers said. Under U.S. law, a person whose property is inspected generally must waive his constitutional protections against unreasonable searches unless authorities obtain a warrant. Evidence collected improperly is not supposed to be used at trial. The FBI in Las Vegas referred questions about the practice to the U.S. Attorney's Office there. Natalie Collins, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Daniel Bogden, said prosecutors were aware of the allegations being made by defense lawyers but declined to comment, citing a pending trial. The gambling case was at least the third to surface in recent weeks raising questions about tactics by federal agents pursuing criminal investigations. The Drug Enforcement Administration set up a fake Facebook account using photographs and other personal information it took from the cellphone of a New York woman arrested in a cocaine case in hopes of tricking her friends and associates into revealing incriminating drug secrets. In another case, the FBI sent a fake news story it attributed to The Associated Press to trick a suspect in a bomb-threat case into clicking on the website link and revealing his location. The AP objected that the FBI's practice was 'unacceptable' and 'undermined AP's credibility.'

"After three previously unrealized opening dates starting as far back as 2006, One World Trade Center will finally open next week. The long awaited opening will come Monday as the first tenants move into the $3.9 billion, 1,776-foot skyscraper. Publishing giant Condé Nast and some 3,400 staffers will fill floors 20 through 44 starting Monday. Finally: The new World Trade Center with all its spectacular views will finally open next week after years of unrealized opening dates and political wrangling . While Condé Nast is the building's largest tenant, other companies have also signed on. Major tenants include the government's General Services Administration, the China Center trade facility and the advertising firm Kids Creative. Getting to this point was not a simple process. The original cost of the building doubled as the structure went up. And the opening date, which was initially set in 2006, was first moved from 2006 to 2011, then 2012 and now to November 2014. Condé Nast, and visitors for that matter, won't be able to take in the spectacular views of the 102nd floor's 120,000 square foot observation deck until spring 2015. Breathtaking: Looking north, the view extends all the way to the Catskills in the distance . To the north and west, visitors will see the busy Hudson River and New Jersey beyond . Once spring finally comes, visitors willing to shell out $29 will be treated to an elevator ride 102 floors up, where they will be greeted with sweeping views of New York City. State and city officials held a news conference in September from the 67th floor of 4 World Trade Center, which opened in November. A completed World Trade Center complex will create a vibrant district and make Lower Manhattan a business and shopping destination, they said. Although costs soared and plans changed for 1 World Trade Center at the beginning of construction, it will open sometime this fall, Rechler said. 'We owed it to all those who perished' to persist and complete the building, Rechler said. The center and a transportation hub will open in phases and may not have a grand opening, he said. The observation deck at One World Trade Center won't open until 2015, but when it does visitors will be treated to spectacular views. From the top, the rolling Catskill Mountains can be made out to the north. South of the tower, viewers will be able to make out New Jersey. Brooklyn is to the east, where the view extends to JFK Aiport, according to the New York Daily News. To the west is the busy Hudson River.

"Diego Costa and Martin Skrtel reignited their feud during Chelsea’s lunchtime showdown at Liverpool. The  pair first clashed during Slovakia’s surprise victory against Spain in their Euro 2016 qualifier in October; the Liverpool defender later revealing that former team-mate Luis Suarez taught him expletive words to taunt Costa. And the duo had to be separated as the teams came off at half-time on Saturday with Liverpool and Chelsea drawing 1-1. Players from both sides got involved with Costa seemingly unhappy with his opponent. Diego Costa grapples with Martin Skrtel before the  pair square up to each other during the game at Anfield .

Costa appeared to be unhappy with Liverpool defender Skrtel as the teams left the field of play at Anfield . The pair had collided on two occasions in the first half of the Premier League showdown at Anfield with Costa fortunate not to find his name in the referee’s notebook after forcibly barging into the back of the Slovakian. Later, Costa appeared to haul Skrtel to the floor after the Liverpool defender won an aerial battle. But the Spain striker then had the last laugh when he scored the game's decisive goal, moments after he was forced to replace a ripped shirt. Costa and Skrtel came to blows throughout Spain and Slovakia's Group C fixture in October and could be seen barging into each other as well as sharing an exchange in the penalty area.

Earlier, Costa had to change his top after he obtained a rip in the back of his shirt during the second half . However, on that occasion Skrtel was on the winning side as former Chelsea youngster Miroslav Stoch scored an 87th minute winner to give Slovakia the victory. Skrtel revealed afterwards that he received a congratulatory message from Suarez. Speaking to The Express, Skrtel said: 'I wrote back thanking him for the rude words he'd taught me which I could use against Diego Costa.' Suarez spent two-and-a-half seasons at Anfield with Skrtel before moving to Barcelona in a £75million deal in July.","Both players had to be separated as the teams headed down the tunnel .

"The identities of a mother and her three children who were killed when a freight train smashed into their SUV just moments before their hometown's Halloween parade have been revealed. Crystal Anna, 35, from Greenville, Illinois, was driving her family through Vandalia when their car was struck by the eastbound CSX train on the tracks on Main Street at 6.45pm on Thursday. Investigators believe she drove past flashing signals and a crossing gate in a bid to get to the parade on time. However, her family have argued that she was blocked in by two other cars. Following the smash, Ms Anna's 18-year-old daughter, Alyssa Sewell, 13-year-old son, Drake Wisnasky and 10-year-old daughter, Anna Wisnasky were pronounced dead at the scene. Scroll down for video .

Her nine-year-old son, Dylan Wisnasky, is currently being treated at a St. Louis hospital. His condition is unknown. It is believed he does not yet know about the fate of his siblings and mother. Ms Anna, who also leaves behind her husband and 14-year-old son Dalton, who were not in the car at the time, was driving in a congested area of the town during heavy rain, Mr Bowen said. But he added: 'The way it is set up, she still should have been able to see the train. I think she possibly was just trying to beat the train to get to the parade on time.'

Resident Ed Smith was smoking a cigarette on his patio near the track when the familiar rumble of an oncoming freight train turned into a loud metallic screech. He told STL Today: 'I thought, ""This can’t be good"", because they don’t lock those train brakes up like that unless something's on the tracks.' As the train approached, the vehicle's engineer tried to alert Ms Anna, including sounding the bell and whistle, said Mr Bowen. But it was unfortunately too late for the stricken driver and her family. 'The whole thing is just a terrible, terrible tragedy that's just unbelievable what this family is going to have to endure,' the coroner said.

Despite authorities' claims that Ms Anna drove around the crossing gate, resident Desiree Fischer, who witnessed the crash, insisted that the car was trapped at the crossing. 'She had been sitting for a few minutes off the tracks,' Ms Fischer told a reporter. 'The cars moved ahead of her. She pulled up to go over the tracks, and the car in front of her stopped. 'That’s when the lights started flashing and then boom, the train hit them.' Ms Anna's cousin, Annie Lawrence, added: 'There was a car behind her, and a car in front of her. She did try to reverse it but the guard rails came down, and the train came through.'

Ms Lawrence told KSDK that her cousin's husband is now trying to figure out 'how to bury four people in one day' following the tragic incident. A train camera recorded the crash. Although the footage is grainy and not of the best quality, it does not support contentions that she was blocked in by traffic, Vandalia Police Chief Jeff Ray said. 'It looked to me like the driver was completely unaware that a train was bearing down. She definitely wasn’t stuck in traffic,' he said. Investigation: Authorities said they still need to interview multiple witnesses to determine what happened . Warning signs: Investigators say they believe warning lights and barriers were working at the time . Mr Ray added that two sets of tracks converge in the area where the accident happened, which can be confusing for out-of-town drivers and may have led to the crash. Illinois State Police Master Sargent Shad Payne said an investigation has been launched. He added initial inquiries indicate the gates were down with lights flashing when the SUV drove on to the track. Abby was in the fifth grade at Greenville Elementary School, Drake was in the seventh grade at Greenville Junior High and their half-sister Alyssa graduated from Greenville High School last year. Scene: The crash site - at Sixth Street and Main Street in Vandalia - was just a block from the parade . One of Alyssa's friends, Will Florian, described the student as 'one of those stereotypical people who would brighten any room she entered'. Vandalia's Halloween parade, featuring around a dozen marching bands and described by locals as the biggest annual event in the town, was situated a block from the crash. It still went ahead.

"Tennis legend John McEnroe’s son landed behind bars this summer over a few bags of baking soda that he mistook for cocaine, it was revealed today. Kevin McEnroe, 28, was arrested in July when police officers witnessed him purchasing six packets of white powdery substance they believed to be cocaine. The tennis ace's offspring was also charged with possession of 20 oxycodone pills and 10 morphine pills following his arrest in the East Village on the night of July 15. Scroll down for video . Duped: Kevin McEnroe was arrested in July for allegedly buying drugs on a Manhattan street corner, but the cocaine in his possession turned out to be baking soda . Kevin McEnroe, right, pictured with his father John, left, has been told he must undergo treatment by November 20 if he is to be eligible for the arrangement which will see the charges against him dropped . But according to court documents cited by the New York Daily News Wednesday, the younger Mr McEnroe had been duped by his alleged drug dealer, who sold him baking soda under the guise of cocaine. Powder: The bogus cocaine was packaged in six bags to make it look like the real thing . It was reported last week that the son of John McEnroe and actress Tatum O'Neal will be able escape a prison term if he remains out of trouble for the next six months. Details of the arrangement emerged in court documents following a hearing. Under the terms of the agreement, McEnroe will be enrolled in a treatment program, which if successful, will see any criminal charges against him dropped. The Manhattan district attorney's office said McEnroe must complete his treatment by November 20. Prosecutors have said that lab tests showed the white powder found in McEnroe's possession was not any controlled substance. 'He was arrested as a result of an observation purchase of this cocaine on the street.

"Exploitation: Insurance fraudster Shoaib Nawaz . A crackdown on whiplash fraud has led to a 10 per cent fall in the number of motor insurance injury claims, figures reveal today. This has seen the cost of motoring personal injury claims by controversial companies cashing in on them plummet by 33 per cent from £354million to £238million, a report by industry watchdogs says. The £116million reduction – the first in a decade – follows legal changes last year and a cull of claims management companies, whose numbers have fallen by 35 per cent to 1,214. ‘There appears to be a correlation between these drops,’ the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries says. As a result, it adds, the cost of average third-party motor insurance premiums has fallen by nearly a fifth. The report says: ‘The number of claims management companies has now halved from its peak of more than 2,500 in 2011 and stands at levels last seen at the end of 2007.’ The crackdown last year came after MPs on the all-party transport select committee condemned the motor insurance claims system as ‘dysfunctional’, making Britain ‘the whiplash capital of Europe’ because of widespread fraud. The targets of the crackdown included ‘crash-for-cash’ gangs such as the one run by Mohammed Omar Gulzar, 31, who devised at least 39 collisions across South Yorkshire to claim up to £500,000 from insurance companies. Working with actors and the fraudulent company City Claims 4 U, Gulzar filed dozens of claims for injuries such as whiplash. On one occasion, he and his employee Shoaib Nawaz, 25, filled a single-decker bus with co-conspirators, before driver Adam Herbert – who was in on the plot – deliberately crashed into a Vauxhall Zafira. Afterwards, 25 people made claims for whiplash. In January, Gulzar and Nawaz were jailed for four-and-a-half and three-and-a-half years respectively for conspiring to defraud insurance companies. Herbert, 26, was jailed for 20 months. The IFoA has long expressed concern about ‘discrepancies’ showing that while the number of damage claims was falling, those for personal injury were soaring. But David Brown, one of the authors of the new report, said: ‘Legal changes in 2013 appear to have had a significant impact on motor insurance injury claims.’ Pain: Whiplash claims dropped last year from £354m to £238m, said the report by watchdogs (posed by model) The biggest changes were those imposed under the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment Offenders Act, which slashed the fees that could be earned by ‘no-win, no-fee’ legal firms. The Government announced last October that whiplash cheats would be targeted by independent medical panels considering evidence only from accredited doctors so that ‘people can no longer profit from exaggerated or fraudulent compensation claims’. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said this would help ‘turn the tide on the compensation culture’. Referal fees paid by lawyers, insurers and claims firms have also been outlawed. Claims firms have been banned from rewarding individuals who bring them business, and the maximum that lawyers can charge for handling uncontested minor injury claims has been slashed from £1,200 to £500, removing a key incentive to settle without asking too many questions. Mr Brown said: ‘The motor insurance industry anticipated the impact of legal changes and has already passed on the reduction in costs to consumers.’ Simon Douglas, director of AA Insurance, said that while the reforms had put ‘downward pressure’ on premiums, ‘too many people are tempted to make a claim knowing that whiplash injury is extremely difficult to disprove’. He added: ‘Government intervention to further toughen up the legal processes could help prevent the otherwise inevitable.’","Claims dropped from £354m to £238m last year, the first fall in a decade .

"A British woman locked in a notorious Iranian jail for trying to watch a men's volleyball match has been charged with 'propaganda against the regime' - three months after being taken prisoner . Ghoncheh Ghavami, 25, was arrested and taken to Tehran's notorious Evin jail a few days after attempting to watch a volleyball match between Iran and Italy on June 20. She was part of a group of women protesting Iranian stricture which bans females from attending men's sporting events. Scroll down for video . Charged: Three months after being jailed in Iran for attending a men's volleyball match, Ghoncheh Ghavami, 25, has been charged with 'propaganda against the regime' Detained: Ms Ghavami was arrested after trying to watch a men's volleyball match at the Azadi Stadium in Tehran (pictured) According to her family, Miss Ghavami has spent 41 days in solitary confinement and been subjected to threats of being moved to a more dangerous prison. An Amnesty International spokesman said: 'She is a prisoner of conscience, arrested solely for taking part in a peaceful protest against the ban on women attending Volleyball World League matches in Tehran’s Azadi Stadium.' At first Ms Ghavami, who previously studied law in London, was arrested then released, but when she went back to fetch her belongings, she was re-arrested and jailed. Several others involved in the demonstration were also detained. Miss Ghavami is of joint British-Iranian heritage, but Iran refuses to acknowledge jointnationality and the fact that she has a British passport is seen as irrelevant. Her brother, 28-year-old Iman Ghavami, previously told ITV News: '[The family] can barely hold themselves together. 'They are torn apart – not just my parents but my grandparents, my uncles, everybody.' Iran's head of police, Esmail Ahmadi Moghadam, told the Fars news agency: 'In the current conditions, the mixing of men and women in stadiums is not in the public interest. Protest: Social media campaigns have sprung up in a bid to pressurise Iran into releasing Ms Ghavami . Notorious: Ms Ghavami has spent 41 days in solitary confinement in Tehran's Evin prison (pictured) 'The stance taken by religious scholars and the supreme leader remains unchanged, and as the enforcer of law, we cannot allow women to enter stadiums.' Social media campaigns have sprung up in a bid to pressurise Iran into releasing Ms Ghavami. There's a Facebook group dedicated to helping her and the hashtag #FreeGhonchehGhavami is being appended to Twitter posts about her plight. The Foreign Office said it was aware of the situation, but has little sway over Iran as it does not have official diplomatic ties with it, so it's unlikely to be able to help Ms Ghavami. Iran's rigid enforcement of Islamic code is down to the influence of its top authority, the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.","Ghoncheh Ghavami, 25, was arrested after attending men's volleyball game .

"Mike Page and his wife woke up in their Atlanta home Tuesday morning to find their two-year-old boxer, Brix, was happily gnawing on a bone in the driveway. When Page went up to see what Brix had in her mouth, he was shocked to find what resembled a human bone. 'It looked like a femur bone, it was a very large bone,' Page told WTXF. Scroll down for video . Good dog: Two-year-old boxer Brix found the first bones, tipping investigators off to the remains of a human body nearby . Shortly after, Brix went out and brought home two more similarly eerie finds, leaving one of the bones she brought back on the couch, prompting Page to call police. An official from the Fulton County Medical Examiner's Office determined the bone found matched that of a human leg bone. 'The medical examiner is saying it looks like from the lower extremity,' said Atlanta Police homicide commander Lt Charles Hampton. 'It could be a femur. Could be a tibia,' he added. 'Right now, I'm not sure which one.' Shortly after the confirmation, cadaver dogs scoured the area, finally coming across a human skeleton behind a house nearby, which the medical examiner matched to the remains found earlier. 'Had we not found these initial bones out here, we wouldn’t even be out here right now to find the current remains that we’ve located this afternoon,' Hampton told the Atlanta Journal Constitution. Watch the full report on 11alive here.

'We’re glad we did find the initial bones, and hopefully we can bring some type of closure to the family,' he said. Police say they don't know how long the remains were there before being found, though they were in an advanced state of decomposition. Details from Page given to WXIA made it seem like the remains had been there for a long time, as 'there was no flesh on the bone. It was completely dry.' They are also in the dark as to the race and sex of the identified body, and though they said there was clothing found nearby, they did not release other details.

"Time Warner Cable told a man living in a rural area of Central New York that it would cost over $20,000 to connect him to broadband internet.

Not THAT rural: Jesee Walser lives in POmpey New York not far from a main road and just a third of a mile away from Time Warner Cable lines . There are Time Warner cable lines less than a mile away from his home but the company still told him it would cost him $20,000. A letter from Time Warner cable to Walser in April 2012 stated that in order to extend service to his home, cable to three homes in a span of 0.32 miles  would need to be built. that number adds up to 9.4 homes per mile. The letter also says that construction would cost $26,470. Time Warner Cable would only be willing to chip in $3,643, leaving $22,862.60 to be paid by Walser. When Walser first moved into his home it only cost him a few hundred dollars to get a copper wire phone service. Even though the home has a Verizon landline, DSL isn't an option in their area. Fios isn't an option either.

"Teenage anorexics are being put at risk because supermarkets are handing over powerful laxatives without any restrictions or age controls, it is claimed. Concerns about the sale of the medicines to youngsters who are dangerously thin and ill were first raised by the eating disorder charity Beat five years ago. However, an undercover survey involving 14-year-old actors found leading supermarkets – Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons and Boots – continue to dish out laxatives without asking questions. Concern: There are fears that many teenagers are abusing laxatives to aid weight loss . The footage will be shown on BBC1’s Watchdog at 8pm tonight. Beat is calling for a change in the law or voluntary measures by stores to ban laxative sales to under-16s. The group also wants the maximum pack size reduced to ten tablets with sales restricted to pharmacies and a warning label that reads: ‘this is not a weight loss product’. The charity’s chief executive, Susan Ringwood, said there is evidence that an increasing number of youngsters are using laxatives as part of their drastic weight loss regimes. She said: ‘We have seen a 30 per cent increase in calls to our helplines over the last year where people have mentioned overusing laxatives in unhealthy way. And that does include a significant number of young people as well.’ Medical experts warn that laxative abuse can cause diarrhoea, dehydration and electrolyte imbalances that can lead to kidney failure. It can also damage the liver and potentially damage the heart leading to heart failure and death. The BBC Watchdog programme sent a group of 14-year-olds into 25 high street stores to purchase three boxes of stimulant laxatives. They were never stopped or questioned by staff, despite buying a minimum of 60 tablets each time. The programme features Carolyn Jones, whose daughter Sarah, aged 15, has been anorexic for two years. The teenager was rushed to hospital in January this year after an overdose of laxatives. Worrying: An undercover survey involving 14-year-old actors for the BBC's Watchdog found leading supermarkets - Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons and Boots - sell laxatives without asking questions . Mrs Jones, from Liverpool, said: ‘It was one evening, she’d not long gone to bed and she shouted she didn’t feel very well with pains in her stomach. ‘She got rushed into the local hospital and after we realised she’d overdosed on laxatives. She took at least 20 in one go. Her blood pressure dropped. Her heart rate dropped. She became so dehydrated that in the morning she stood up and just collapsed. ‘I didn’t realise that children or young people would get hold of laxatives to take them to lose weight. I didn’t realise they’d even think of doing something like that. ‘It turns out she was actually going out in her lunch hour, even before school and after school, in her uniform to the local Tesco supermarket and picking them up off the shelf, paying for them and walking out, no-one bats an eyelid.’ She added: ‘Sarah is now recovering but I am constantly scared that she can just as easily go into any store and buy as many laxatives as she likes.’ Seventeen-year-old Lottie Hall, from Hertfordshire, tells the programme she started taking stimulant laxatives to help her lose weight when she was just 13 and now suffers long term damage. ‘At first it would start with just a few, four or five. Over time my body just got used to it and I found that I had to have more and more. So in the end I could be taking 20, 30 a day to get them to have the desired effect,’ she said. ‘It was a long time, probably about three years before my parents found out and I started getting help for it.’ The sale of drugs is policed by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, which said it has no plans to restrict laxative sales but it will put stronger warnings on packets. A spokesman said: ‘Abuse of laxatives by people suffering from eating disorders is sustained over a long period of time. Investigation: The undercover probe will be aired tonight on the BBC's consumer affairs show Watchdog . 'While reducing the pack size will minimise the quantity of product accessed in one transaction it will not prevent a person who is determined to abuse these products from purchasing multiple packs by visiting different sales outlets and via different internet pharmacies in this country and abroad.’ However, the MHRA said there are plans to have stronger warnings on packs stressing that laxatives do not aid weight loss and that taking them regularly for a long time is harmful. All the retailers said they abide by existing regulations on sales, were aware of the concerns and willing to follow any new regulations the Government brings in. Boots said they would be happy to work on developing new controls. A spokesman said: ‘On an issue like this it’s important that manufacturers, retailers and regulatory bodies work together to look at how to respond and we would welcome being involved in a wider conversation on this topic to understand what further action could be agreed.’ Sainsbury’s said staff are being advised to look out for customers who are bulk buying laxatives. Asda said it would comply with any request from the government to restrict sales. Morrisons said it could be helpful if the government developed new regulations to control sales.

Jail: Hassen (left) was sentenced to 12 months behind bars. He had admitted assaulting Miss Watton (right) But Hassen, originally from Zimbabwe, refused to accept the relationship was over and launched a prolonged attack on his former partner in April last year. He had stayed at Miss Watton’s home uninvited for three days after looking after their children when she went on a rare night out. Hassen launched the attack as their three children sat watching cartoons on TV downstairs after finding messages on Miss Watton’s phone from another man. Miss Watton only escaped his clutches after convincing him to take her shopping - and she secretly begged staff to call the police. Hassen was arrested outside the shop after Miss Watton took off a hat she was wearing to show officers the shocking injuries he had inflicted.

Describing her ordeal, Miss Watton . said: ‘Suddenly he just grabbed me and pulled something tight around my . neck. Everything was a blur, but I knew that this was only the very . beginning. ‘He tied me up and questioned me endlessly about what I’d been up to the night before and who I had been with. 'Tears . streamed down my face and I thought he was going to kill me.

My hair felt like it . was being ripped out by the roots and the pain was excruciating. ‘Tears . streamed down my face and I thought he was going to kill me. Then he . started pulling at my hair and I heard the clicking sound of the blades. ‘I . knew then he was cutting my hair off. I could feel the blades opening . and snapping shut against my scalp. He wanted to make me unattractive, . like less of a woman. Happier days: Miss Watton, originally from Surrey, met Hassen through friends before they moved to Scotland together in 2004 . ‘He wanted to embarrass me and to make me look ill.

He hoovered up the hair himself, it was just so surreal.’ David Fisken, defending, said: ‘He was extremely angry that she had been seeing someone else and the relationship was at an end. 'He does regret his conduct, he let himself down and his family down.

"A former gunner in the Royal Artillery had his dying wish granted when his ashes were fired from a 19th century cannon. Derek Chatting was given the unusual send off following a service which was a re-enactment of an 1880s officer's funeral carried out by 20 people at Nothe Fort in Weymouth, Dorset. Mr Chatting served 24 years in the Royal Artillery, working his way up through the ranks to Warrant Officer Class 2. The cannon at Nothe Fort in Weymouth, which was used to fire the ashes of former soldier Derek Chatting . He started his military career with the Junior Leaders before joining the 45 Medium Regiment Royal Artillery in 1971. He was posted to the 52 (Niagara) Battery and in the late 1970s he was eventually promoted to warrant officer. When he realised he was losing his battle with cancer he told his friends and family how he wanted his ashes to be fired from a cannon rather than scattered. In July he died aged 59 after suffering from brain and lung tumours for almost four years. And almost straight away, his former army comrades Kenneth Priestley, Peter Rigby and Nick Mercer started working on how to fulfil his final request. Mr Chatting served for 24 years in the Royal Artillery and started his career in the 1970s, right, before being promoted to a warrant officer . Mr Priestley then contacted the Royal Artillery but was told it would cost them £3,000. After sharing the news with former colleagues on Facebook, it was suggested that they ask at the local fort. They then got in touch with Paul Merry, who runs the Nothe Fort Artillery Volunteers re-enactment group, who agreed to carry out the stunt. Mr Priestley explained: 'I went to visit him just after last Christmas. I was chatting to him about how he was feeling and he just came out with it - ""I want my ashes fired over Salisbury Plain, Ken."" 'I just laughed and said that’s typical of you Derek, wanting the impossible. 'He had been thinking about it ever since he was diagnosed. Mr Chatting's army comrade Kenneth Priestley, who organised the final send-off along with old colleagues Peter Rigby and Nick Mercer . 'When I contacted the Royal Artillery they weren’t overly happy to do it and they wanted about £3,000. 'On Facebook I asked other ex-servicemen who knew Derek what to do and Peter suggested the fort. 'He got in touch with them and they wanted far less money so we started organising it. 'It was perfect for Derek and his attitude. He kept fighting until the end.' About 30 family members and former comrades travelled from all over the country to see Mr Chatting’s ashes fired from a six-pounder, smoothbore 1800 cannon in the 30-minute ceremony. His daughter Leanne Clegg said: 'It was a hard weekend for us because it was the final thing, but it was a nice way to say goodbye. 'He would have been really chuffed with it. He was not the shy and retiring type, I think it would have been really special to him. 'I’m really happy we were able to do what he wanted and it was really touching that all his army friends went to so much effort.' Around 30 family members and former comrades travelled from all over the country to attend the service including his daughter Leanne Clegg, pictured with her husband Craig, centre . The cannon is about 60 inches long and has a range of more than 4,500 feet. It was prepared by putting in a bag of black powder, followed by a bag of Derek’s ashes and then lighting the fuse. Mr Merry explained: 'When Peter contacted me and asked if it was possible to fire Derek’s ashes from the cannon, I had to look into it and make sure it was still legal. 'Looking back through the records the last ceremony was before the First World War, so it’s been over 100 years. 'People had spoken to us about this sort of thing before, but it never actually got to the point of organising it. 'On the day it wasn’t just a case of me firing the cannon, it was a whole period show. We had 20 re-enactors in full uniform who performed full military honours for Derek. 'We fired his ashes out of the cannon twice, once to start the minute’s silence and once to signify the end and had a bugle playing the last post. 'There were obviously a few tears as the bugle played but his family were really happy with how it went. 'His son and daughter came up to me and said they weren’t expecting so much to be put in. Paul Merry of the Nothe Fort Artillery Volunteers with the cannon that was used to fire Mr Chatting's ashes . 'For Derek, he was an artillery man and had spent his whole life working with guns. It’s something different but his family said it summed him up completely. He had a good sense of humour. 'They were so chuffed and that was really important to us.' Since the ceremony, the group have had seven enquiries from families who want to arrange a similar send-off. Nothe Fort was built between 1860 and 1872 by 26 Company of the Royal Engineers to protect Portland’s harbour, which was then becoming an important Royal Navy base. It included bomb proof casemates for cannons arranged around the sides, and . played an important role in World War Two, when the harbour was used as base by the British and American navy. In 1956 the fort was abandoned, and in 1961 it was purchased by the local council. It is now a museum, attracting thousands of tourists each year.","Derek Chatting told family his dying wish was to be fired out of a cannon .

Police were called to a Noosa Heads home at about 4.30am on Thursday when neighbours heard a gunshot. When they arrived they heard a man making threats to a woman inside. The man then made a break for it on a motorbike, police say, before allegedly stealing the news car and crashing it into a petrol station. His partner was taken to hospital with head and neck injuries. Cameraman Mr Steer, who was on his way to cover the incident, said a man on a motorbike stopped him and pulled out a weapon. 'He got off his bike and approached me and said ""I've got a story for you"". I said ""Well mate, you better hurry because I'm going to a shooting"", and he said ""Mate, I'm the shooter.""' Mr Steer talked to the man and kept him calm, and the man handed Mr Steer his pistol and said he wanted to hand himself to police before breaking down in tears. But before he knew it, the man had taken back the pistol and aimed it back at Steer before taking off in his car, which can also be seen in the Seven footage. Steer recounted the experience to Seven News on Thursday evening and told the program: 'It was unexpected, up until that point I'd felt fairly secure knowing that the police I'd called were on their way.'

'When I saw him reach for the passenger side of the vehicle and reach for the gun ... it did sort of ring a few alarm bells in my head.' From there Mr Steer kept the camera rolling out of instinct, saying he weighed up whether he would keep shooting or or get out of the line of fire. Mr Steer then managed to track him down and capture footage at a Eumundi service station where he crashed into a petrol tank and is cornered by police. Officers can be seen pointing their guns toward the man, who they specifically instruct to 'move away' and 'get back'. 'I got to a little town called 'mundi and a chap on a Harley (Davidson) sort of pulled me over, I thought there might have been something wrong with my car,' Mr Steer told Sunrise.

'I thought they were about to start filming or something, I thought it was a documentary, then I didn't think anything of it.

"The best-selling author Ian McEwan has been heckled in front of hundreds of fans at a literary festival - by his own ex-wife. Penny Allen started berating the author, from whom she split in 1995, from the back of the audience as he discussed his latest book, 'The Children Act', a fictional treatment of a collapsing marriage, at the Cheltenham Literary Festival. Mr McEwan, 56, did not respond directly to his Ms Allen's tirade although he was heard to mutter that the person making the noise 'it's my ex-wife'. Scroll down for video . Penny Allen, left, ex-wife of renowned author Ian McEwan, right, heckled him at a literary festival in Cheltenham . According to The Times, Ms Allen asked: 'I have a question. Why don't you tell people about the injunctions and superinjunctions you have taken out on me.' Under the terms of their split, Mr McEwan was granted custody of their pair's children and she has been prevented from talking in public about the settlement. Ms Allen previously told The Daily Mail: 'It is certainly a bit rich that Mr McEwan champions free speech but I am stifled and have no such freedom to defend myself, which has had a catastrophic effect on my ability to work as a writer and a journalist. We don't give interviews but he does.' She said that she had been a major influence on much of his earlier work. When their relationship ended, Ms Allen believes Mr McEwan used their shared experience as an inspiration for his book 'Black Dogs'. Mr McEwan was telling the audience that his most recent book was about a female judge who must decide whether she should order whether a teenage Jehovah Witness boy should receive live-saving medical treatment despite his reluctance and the opposition of his family. As a sub-plot, Mr McEwan wrote that his character's marriage was collapsing, prompting Ms Allen to say that he was writing about their failed relationship. Mr McEwan told the audience: 'I gave her a disintegrating marriage to give her turmoil in her private life to run alongside [issues in her professional life].' Following the interruption, Ms Allen and a friend were escorted from the building.

I’ve been in it, I’m familiar with the Family Division. We had years and years of it. It floated from the Crown Court to the High Court in the end.’ She said: 'It seems iniquitous that while I am bound by law to be silent, he is free to promote his new book in publicity interviews by referring to it [the divorce].' Mr McEwan published The Children Act last month to very warm reviews even being serialised on BBC Radio 4's Book at Bedtime. The book features a judge who has to deal with a difficult case involving a teenage Jehovah Witness boy who is refusing life-saving medical treatment while having to cope with the breakdown of her marriage.

The break up between him and his ex-wife Ms Allen was incredibly acrimonious. In one hearing in 1999, Ms Allen and her partner Steve Tremain arrived at court wearing gags over their mouths in protest against an injunction banning them from talking about the proceedings. She even believes the title of the book is an attempt to criticise her as the gagging order secured by Mr McEwan was granted under the terms of the Children's Act. Now she is planning to write a journal of her divorce experience based on her struggle with Mr McEwan. She decided to write the book four years ago when she found a box which contained much of the rulings and correspondence of her bitter divorce. Ms Allen was married once before she met Mr McEwan is currently in a relationship with Steve Tremaine, living in a 15th century cottage in Brittany, France. He latter married Annalena McAfee, a journalist who interviewed him for the Financial Times. In a 1991 interview Mr McEwan described his ex-wife as ' the single most important influence on my work . . . I suppose I was lucky I married a woman who fascinated me and I remain fascinated by her. 'She is a very strong presence in my life, emotionally, sexually —and this emerges in my work.’ During the divorce, a court document revealed that a judge described her as 'a purveyor of half-truths, twisted information, inaccuracies and false inferences'. Ms Allen said the comments were made after she complained to the Lord Chancellor over the handling of the case. 'I was never given a chance to reply or to explain anything,’ she says. Today mother and father are both close to their adult sons —though the parents are never together when they seem them — and one has just produced McEwan’s first grandchild. Ian McEwan has written a total of 13 novels with his best-seller Amsterdam winning the highly prestigious Man Booker Prize. He is one of the biggest earning authors in Britain, living in a £7.5 million Gloucestershire mansion as well as a townhouse in London. He has been nominated for the Man Booker prize six times. He received $2 million from the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas for his archives. His 2001 book Atonement was adapted for film in 2007 and starred Keira Knightly, pictured right, arriving at the UK premier of the movie. He has married twice, first to Ms Allen and then to journalist Annalena McAfee, whom he married after they met during an interview for the Financial Times.","Author Ian McEwan was heckled by his ex-wife Penny Allen at a festival .

"A black man who was shot by Utah police while armed with a samurai-style sword as part of a Japanese anime costume died of multiple gunshot wounds, including several in the back of his body, an autopsy has revealed. Darrien Hunt suffered six gunshots wounds, and at least four entered the 22-year-old's body from behind when he was shot in September 10. The state autopsy results back-up an independent findings released by Hunt's family who claimed he was treated differently because he was black. Darrien Hunt, left, pictured with his mother Susan, middle, was shot six times by police, including four times in the back, a state autopsy has revealed . Hunt was shot after walking around a strip mall in the Utah city of Saratoga Springs wearing a red shirt and blue pants - similar to that worn by an anime character - and carrying 2.5ft steel sword . Before being shot dead, Hunt, seen in red, was seen smiling and talking to two police officers at the scene . Hunt's mother, Susan said: 'I don't think anyone would have thought twice if it wasn't someone with an afro.' Police have said race was not a factor in the shooting which occurred when Hunt walked around a strip mall in the Utah city of Saratoga Springs wearing a red shirt and blue pants - similar to that worn by an anime character - and carrying 2.5ft steel sword. Police said they were called to the scene following a 911 call about a man with a sword, and shot Hunt after he lunged at them, swinging the weapon. Hunt's family maintain the sword was decorative, rather than dangerous. The autopsy states an officer fired three shots when Hunt charged at him, swinging the sword, as he got out of his car. Police then fired four more times as they chased him. An attorney for the Hunt family, Robert Sykes, disputed the officers' account, saying a picture taken by a bystander shows Hunt smiling as he talked to two officers. Tim Taylor, chief deputy at the Utah County Attorney's Office, said that Hunt talked to officers after they arrived, asking them for a ride. Ms Hunt, seen speaking at a press conference above, said: 'I don't think anyone would have thought twice if it wasn't someone with an afro.' The Hunt family's attorney Robert Sykes speaks during a press conference concerning the autopsy results; he said the fact Hunt was shot in the back means police were pursing him and he was 'probably scared to death' He said the county attorney's investigation into whether the shooting was legally justified could be complete within a week. Mr Taylor said the trajectory of the shots found by the autopsy indicates Hunt was turning away when they were fired, but investigators are still looking at exactly what happened during the encounter. The autopsy shows four of the gunshots found in Hunt's body traveled back to front. A fifth shot that struck his left arm appears to have come from the front and a sixth traveled downward after entering the back of his forearm. Mr Sykes said: 'I think that means they were pursuing him, he was running away. He was probably sacred to death.' Ms Susan said she hopes the officers involved are held accountable, and barred from using firearms in the future. The officers, who are white, have been identified as Cpl. Matthew Schauerhamer and Officer Nicholas Judson. Saratoga Springs is an upscale city of 23,000 people south of Salt Lake City. About 93 percent of residents are white and fewer than 1 percent are black, according to U.S. Census figures.","State autopsy backs up the findings of one earlier released by family .

"Rachael Thompson, 40, has been found guilty of slashing her baby boy's heels with a razor blade . A mother faces jail for slashing her baby son's feet with razor blades and causing 'horrific' injuries. Rachael Thompson, 40, was found guilty of slicing the four-month-old's heels, as the jury heard that the wounds could only have been caused deliberately. Thompson took her son into hospital two days after attacking him, claiming the injuries were an accident. She said the boy had somehow cut himself on a razor which had fallen into his bath. Jo Martin, prosecuting, said Thompson told medics she had been bathing the child when she left him with her partner. She claimed she had come back to find the child's feet bleeding and a razor blade lying in the tub. But Derriford Hospital A&E nurse Emma Congdon contacted social services when she became suspicious about why Thompson had waited two days to bring her son in. She said the mother told her the baby had 'kicked' the razor into the bath. She told the court the boy's wounds were 'horrific', adding: 'You would not leave a four month old baby on its own in the bath.' Ms Martin said police consulted an expert who said a falling razor would be unlikely to slice into a baby's feet. And even if it did, it would cut in a 'criss-cross' fashion rather deliver a clean, identical wound to both heels, she said. At a hearing earlier this month, an expert who tried to reconstruct an accident using a wooden model of a baby’s leg covered in pig skin could not replicate the wounds. The boy spent a night in hospital before being released. Plymouth Crown Court in Devon, where Thompson was found guilty of slicing her son's feet . The child still lives in Plymouth, Devon, with Thompson and her partner Trevor Parkins, who have another son together, aged 15 months. Thompson, a former nursing auxiliary and dental nurse, also has a 22-year-old son from an earlier relationship. Thompson has a history of self-harm and suffered from a personality disorder caused by childhood abuse and bullying at school, the court heard. She has also suffered from the eating disorder bulimia for most of her adult life. After her arrest, Thompson told police: 'I would never hurt my child'. But it took the jury just two and a half hours to find her guilty at Plymouth Crown Court. She was convicted of assaulting the boy between September 14 and September 18, 2011, and has been released on bail until sentencing on November 7.","Rachael Thompson, 40, found guilty in hearing at Plymouth Crown Court .

"Motoring organisations last night welcomed a city’s ‘bold’ decision to scrap most of its bus lanes – and urged others to follow suit. Liverpool is believed to be the first local authority in the country to remove bus lanes en masse after a successful year-long trial without them. Motoring groups welcomed the move and said they hoped it would be the start of a new trend. The AA said all councils should now review their use of the bus-lanes so that they were used only where absolutely necessary - and not simply to punish motorists for having the temerity to use their cars. Liverpool is to remove nearly all of its bus lanes after a study found they were not working properly . In a victory for ordinary car drivers, Town hall chiefs declared the bus lanes, which prioritise passenger vehicles while restricting the amount of space left for drivers and other road users, ‘simply don’t work’. An independent review recommending retaining just four of its 26 bus lanes was backed earlier by Liverpool City council’s cabinet. Anti-car campaigners like bus lanes because – in the transport planners’ jargon - they ‘deny road-space’ to motorists, thereby artificially creating man-made traffic jams, while simultaneously allowing those in buses to get around the gridlock in their otherwise empty reserved lanes. This sends a less than subtle message to drivers to leave their cars behind and use public transport. For these very same reasons the bus lanes are loathed by drivers. Bus lanes boomed during the last Labour Government’s so-called ‘integrated transport policy’ which was dubbed a ‘war on motorists’ by opponents. The most infamous bus lane on the M4 into London – dubbed the ‘Blair lane’ because the then Labour Prime Minster’s driver used it to speed Mr Blair out of the gridlock from Heathrow airport into the capital citing ‘security’ reasons for the VIP exemption . It was scrapped within weeks by Conservatives within the coalition government getting into power in 2010. Only four of the 26 lanes will be saved, if the city council approves, and they could operate at different times . Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson introduced his city’s bus-lane free trial in September 2013. AA president Edmund King welcomed the move in Liverpool and hoped other towns and cities would follow suit. He said: ‘Town halls should review where and when they operate bus lanes. Too many of them are not working. They may be operating 24 hours a day when there’s no need for it because the perceived traffic problem applies only for eight of them. ‘Bus lanes are like yellow no parking lines. They are not always necessary. Councils must review their blanket use.’ An RAC spokesman called the move ‘bold’, adding: ‘It’s interesting to see a city the size of Liverpool taking a very different approach to congestion and if it continues to be successful may well set a precedent for other UK cities to follow suit.’ Bus operator Stagecoach said it was an ‘irresponsible’ move which ignored the needs of ‘thousands of bus passengers’. A Stagecoach spokeswoman said: ‘It is clear that the needs of the thousands of people who rely on bus services every single day across Liverpool are not seen as a priority by the city council.’ She said loss of bus lanes would increase journey times, adding: ‘We believe this is an irresponsible decision which could well come back to haunt them.’ The review by engineering consultant Mott MacDonald looked at issues such as changes in bus journey times, times of non-bus passenger numbers and accident statistics. It examined traffic flow on three of the city’s main bus corridors - Prescot Road, between the Royal Liverpool Hospital and Alder Hey Hospital;, County Road, between Scotland Road and the M57 motorway; and Picton Road, between Edge Lane and Belle Vale - where the majority of the bus lanes are placed. The report, which included data from researchers who travelled as bus passengers, said bus lanes only offered ‘marginal benefits’ along all three corridors. It also found that buses were slowed down by on-street parking rather than other vehicles on the road. To address this councillors also approved moves to study the possibility of ‘red routes’ to deal with ‘indiscriminate street parking’. Mayor Anderson also promised that roads where the lanes are scrapped will have better provision for cyclists. Traffic Regulation Orders for the bus lanes will now be revoked with new orders introduced for the four remaining lanes.","City to remove nearly all bus lanes after study found they are not working .

"Facebook is stepping up its efforts to fight Ebola by adding a button designed to make it easier for its users to donate to charities battling the disease. The social media company is also donating and deploying 100 satellite communication terminals to boost Internet and phone services to affected areas in West Africa, where the disease has killed nearly 5,000. The programs come on the heels of a $25 million donation last month by CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention toward the Ebola response. Scroll down for video . Helping hand: This image  shows an example of a message and donation button the company has designed to make it easier for its users to donate . Facebook Inc. says that, over the coming week, its users will see an option to donate to three nonprofits fighting Ebola. The groups are the International Medical Corps, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, and Save the Children. Facebook says it chose charities that work directly on the ground and are able to accept money globally. The Menlo Park, California company says the terminals will provide Internet and voice-calling access to remote areas of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone so that medical aid workers can get access to voice and data services. The devices will also help people with Ebola who have been placed in isolation communicate with their families, and health workers who've traveled to Africa keep in touch with friends and family back home, said Chris Weasler, Facebook's head of spectrum policy and connectivity planning, in an interview from Ghana. In a statement, the company said 'If not addressed, the Ebola epidemic could become a long-term global health crisis. Together with our partners, we’re hopeful that by offering people the tools they need, we can all help fight this disease.' Aid: Facebook is hoping that its donation button will increase the money going toward Ebola response efforts . 'These units will provide connectivity in places where there is no coverage,' he told the Associated Press. Ebola treatment units are being set up where the disease pops up, and not necessarily where there is already Internet coverage. 'In other cases, (they will be) adding more capacity to networks increasingly strained from the influx of responders,' he added. Facebook is hoping that its donation button will increase the money going toward Ebola response efforts. Ebola aid donations have lagged behind large natural disasters such as Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines last year or the earthquake in Haiti four years ago. So far, the American Red Cross has raised nearly $3.7 million for Ebola relief. In comparison, it received $486 million after the Haiti earthquake and more than $88 million in the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan. 'We need to get Ebola under control in the near term so that it doesn't spread further and become a long term global health crisis that we end up fighting for decades at large scale, like HIV or polio,' Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page last month. In October, Zuckerberg wrote an explanation to a Facebook commenter over his donation, Business Insider reported, in which he stated 'I think we have a responsibility to help out wherever we see a need.'","Facebook is adding a button designed to make it easier for its users to donate to charities battling Ebola .

"A man who said he'd rather accept the death penalty than sit through arguments over his fate after being convicted of killing a baby and her grandmother has been sentenced to die. Raghunandan Yandamuri, 28, was sentenced to death row on Tuesday after a jury found him guilty last week in the 2012 slayings in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. Yandamuri killed 10-month-old Saanvi Venna and 61-year-old Satayrathi Venna in a botched kidnapping hatched to get ransom money from the baby's parents. Raghunandan Yandamuri, said he'd rather accept the death penalty than sit through arguments over his fate after being convicted of killing a baby and her grandmother has been sentenced to die. Pictured: Yandamuri arriving at Montgomery County Court House last month . Prosecutors say Yandamuri needed the ransom money to pay off gambling and credit card debts. The former IT worker stabbed the grandmother when she got in the way of the kidnapping. He then left a ransom note behind, demanding $50,000 from the baby's parents for her life. 'I thought Sanvi's parents could afford to pay the money because both of them were software engineers,' Yandamuri said in a confessional statement. Murderer: Yandamuri was found guilty last week in the 2012 slayings of baby Saanvi Venna (right) and her 61-year-old grandmother Satayrathi Venna (left) Yandamuri told investigators that the baby died when he accidentally dropped her and put a handkerchief over her mouth to quiet her and a towel around her head.

When jurors were moved to tears heaving about the gruesome killings, Yandamuri showed no remorse which may have led to the sentencing decision. At a hearing Friday, Yandamuri told a judge he'd rather be executed than listen to others debate his fate - and got his wish four days later. On Tuesday, he barely reacted to the death sentence and continued to keep his head down jotting notes. 'I felt that if he had expressed remorse, he would have had a better chance at saving his life,' his sentencing attorney Henry Hilles told the Philadelpha Inquirer. A jury deliberated for three and a half hours on Tuesday to come to that decision, choosing the death sentence over life in prison. The decision is reportedly what the victims' family was hoping for. 'It's not going to give them back what they lost, but it is a sense of closure for them,' Deputy District Attorney Samantha Cauffman said.","A Pennsylvania jury sentenced 28-year-old Raghunandan Yandamuri to death on Tuesday, for killing a 10-month-old baby and her grandmother .

"These heart-stopping pictures show a group of teenage thrillseekers scaling a 300ft high crane - with one even hanging off by one hand.

A police spokeswoman said: 'Free running, which is climbing up tall buildings and structures and jumping from one building to another, is extremely dangerous and can result in serious injury or death. 'It could also injure somebody on the ground if the free running causes damage to the structure as tiles, masonry and other items may be dislodged and fall.'

"The sister of Australian jihadist Mohamed Elomar was stopped by border police from leaving Australia this week. The 29-year-old was flagged up at Sydney Airport trying to board a 6am flight to Dubai on Tuesday with her two children when she came to authorities attention. Border officials detained the woman, who has not been named, and questioned her and she was later released, reports Daily Telegraph. Scroll down for video . Mohamed Elomar said: 'Islamic State still holds its position either by victory or martyrdom' Mohamed Elomar, a former boxer from western Sydney who left to fight in Syria late last year, poses with severed heads . The woman was reportedly trying to leave Sydney Airport using her own passport and she was stopped because she was listed a 'person of interest'. She was released but was stopped from leaving Australia. Elomar, a former boxer from western Sydney who left to fight in Syria late last year, has been disowned by his family after learning of his brutality as a member of IS. His father, Mamdouh Elomar, said his son made him sick: 'When I see him on the news, it's very bad. I'm very shamed. I'm not proud.' Mohamed Elomar's father Mamdouh said his son 'made him sick' and he was 'not proud' Mamdouh said has not talked to his son in two years after a falling out his son Mohamed who worked as a surveyor or draftsman at the family business. 'I cannot understand what my son did, it makes me want to vomit,' he said. The Elomar patriarch is also friends with community leader Dr Jamal Rifi Mohamed threatened the doctor on Twitter after Dr Rifi condemned him. Mamdouh said every time he saw his son on the news he could not help but feel ashamed by Mohamed's actions. Sources say Elomar's sister was on a ­no-fly list because of the relationship to her brother, who has boasted of his brutal terrorist activities in Iraq and Syria. Elomar has including posting images of himself holding the severed heads of Syrian soldiers. Friends of Elomar's sister reportedly said border control she was not bound Iraq or Syria, where her brother is fighting with the ­Islamic State. 'This was a mistake. She was not going there. She was travelling for other reasons,' one friend told Daily Telegraph. Elomar is believed to have travelled to the Middle East with his sadistic sidekick Khaled Sharrouf, who slipped out of the country last December using his brother's passport. The pair have since become the evil face of social media, regularly posting images of their atrocities. When it was discovered he had gone to Syria, his sister had insisted he had travelled there for humanitarian purposes. Sources claimed the detection of Elomar's sister at Sydney Airport demonstrated the success of heightened security measures at the airport which have closed the gaps in the system which had allowed Sharrouf to slip out undetected. Mohammad Ali Baryalei, a former Kings Cross bouncer who played a bit part in Underbelly, has been identified as a senior military commander in the Islamic State. He recruited Elomar into ISIS . Khaled Sharrouf is also wanted by the Australian Federal Police for alleged terrorist activities in the Middle East after he fled the country in December with Elomar on his brother's passport . Elomar has warned on Facebook that the Islamic state will hold its position in Iraq and Syria 'by victory or martyrdom' and dismissed US military operations in Iraq and Syria. When asked about media reports that Islamic State fighters are trying to return to their home countries, Elomar told News Corp: 'Maybe it's true, maybe it's propaganda. But Islamic State still holds its position either by victory or martyrdom. Besides, what can a bunch of planes do?' Elomar, using the Facebook pseudonym 'Al Australi Abu Hafs', also claimed that American air strikes only 'hit civilians, not the Mujahideen'. He then began referencing Chapter 9 of the Quran, which contains the 'Verse of the Sword' passage terrorists often cite to justify jihad. 'And when the forbidden months have passed, kill the idolaters wherever you find them and take them prisoners, and beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them at every place of ambush. 'But if they repent and observe Prayer and pay the Zakat, then leave their way free. Surely, Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful,' the verse reads. A spokesperson for the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection told Daily Mail Australia: 'The Government will not be providing a running commentary on these matters. 'The Government will take the steps necessary at our borders to protect our national security. 'At times, this will mean that national security takes priority over the convenience of the traveller. 'Our officers do not stop travellers indiscriminately.' Omarjan Azari (pictured) has been charged with a serious terrorism related offence and allegedly plotted to behead a member of the public in Martin Place . On Thursday  at least 800 officers from AFP and NSW Police were involved in Australia's biggest anti-terror raids. Omarjan Azari appeared in court on the same day charged with a conspiracy to prepare a terrorist attack on Australian soil. He was denied bail and will reappear in court on November 13. He is the second man charged so far after police arrested 15 people in the raids. According to court documents, police intercepted a phone call three days ago between Omarjan Azari and Mohammad Ali Baryalei, who is alleged to have recruited half of the 60 Australians fighting in the Middle East. The account said Baryalei ordered him to carry out an attack, which Sydney Central Local Court heard was 'clearly designed to shock, horror and terrify the community'. 'Afghanis are traditionally more interested in study than sport,' the accused's cousin Rami Azari told Daily Mail Australia. 'There was another Greek kid who wasn't as good but Omarjan knew he wanted it desperately and so Omarjan gave up his place. 'He was always interested in justice and fighting against injustice. 'Maybe [that's what got him into trouble.' 'I don't believe that he made the phone call [making the beheading threat],' Omarjan's cousin said. 'He'd stopped using his phone because he was being followed by police and ASIO.' Omarjan's uncle, University of Western Sydney lecturer in Afghani studies, Dr Ehsan Azari, said his nephew was 'very pious'. 'But if he is truly involved in this it is someone else who has convinced him, turned his mind,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'He was not a scholar, or very good at school.' Prime Minister Tony Abbott increases Australia's terrorism threat level from medium to high and warns Australians to expect increased security on September 11. Australians will see more security at airports, ports, military bases, government buildings, public landmarks and major sporting events. It's the highest alert level in more than a decade and means the chances of a terror strike is now considered 'much more likely'.","Elomar's sister, who has not been named, is listed as a 'person on interest' to the police .

"The exams regulator has approved a new English A-Level to be taught in schools which will see sixth formers study comedian Russell Brand and rapper Dizzee Rascal. Ofqual has given the go-ahead for the new qualification to be taught from next September, according to the OCR exam board, which drew up the course with the English and Media Centre. Among the works that will be required to be studied on the course include Mr Brand's evidence on drugs policy which was presented to MPs and the transcript of a BBC Newsnight interview with Dizzee Rascal. Scroll down for video . As part of a new English A-Level to be offered by the OCR exam board from next September, students will study texts such as the transcript of Russell Brand giving evidence to MPs on drugs policy . The OCR board say including a rich mix of content, such as speeches by Russell Brand, pictured, would inspire and engage students . Students will also have to study extracts by The Secret Footballer, who has anonymously written about professional football as well as tweets by the broadcaster and columnist Caitlin Moran and memoirs such as Twelve Years A Slave. They will be on the text list alongside more traditional literature such as poems by Emily Dickinson and William Blake and works by George Orwell, William Shakespeare and Charlotte Bronte. The organisations who drew up the syllabus say the aim of the new A-level is for students to 'develop the skills to analyse any text, whether spoken or written, literary or non-literary, in the most appropriate way. They add that students studying a play like The Importance of Being Earnest by Oscar Wilde will have to look at ideas such as form, structure and dramatic techniques, while those reading the transcript of the Dizzee Rascal interview will look at concepts like purpose and audience. When the draft content of the course was published earlier this year there were reports that the Department for Education (DfE) was critical of the qualification, suggesting it representing a 'dumbing down' of the subject. But Paul Dodd, director of reform at OCR said: 'We are delighted that Ofqual has accredited this fresh and exciting new specification. Sixth formers will also study the Newsnight interview by Dizzee Rascal, left, and tweets sent by the writer Caitlin Moran, right . 'Both OCR and EMC believe that combined English Language and Literature offers something special. 'Our aim in creating the specification was to produce a course with a rich, diverse mix of content - including highly regarded contemporary texts as well as long-established works - that will inspire and engage a new generation of students.' While an Ofqual spokeswoman said: 'We have accredited OCR’s English Language and Literature AS and A level. 'The content requirements for this qualification are set by Government and we set the requirements for how it should be assessed. We have a robust process in place to make sure the qualifications we accredit meet these requirements. The English course is one of a number of new A-levels due to be brought in next year following the Government’s major overhaul of the exams system. A DfE spokesman said: 'The criteria for English language and literature clearly set out the expectations exam boards must meet, in order to be approved. 'Decisions on whether these criteria have been met are rightly a matter for Ofqual.'","Ofqual has approved new English A-level to be taught from next September .

"A paralyzed teenager who was found dead in a filthy, cockroach-infested home was covered with bedsores so deep her bone and organs could be seen, it has emerged. Linda Kelley's heartbreaking living conditions were revealed during hearings into how the 18-year-old's case was handled by the Department of Child Services before her death in August. A DCS case worker and employees from Damar Services, which provides care to patients with special needs, had visited the teen at her parents' home in Indianapolis just six days before she died. Marion Juvenile Court Judge Marilyn Moores held hearings last month to see if staff had falsified positive reviews of the girl's living conditions, the Indianapolis Star reported. Tragic: Linda Kelley, pictured holding her nephew, passed away in her parents' filthy home in August just six days after she was visited by child services. A judge has ruled there was 'negligent oversight' by staff . But she concluded that they did not. Instead, there was a 'negligent oversight, if not reckless disregard, of the conditions of the home', she said. DCS Director Mary Beth Bonaventura said the girl was failed by multiple people, including the case worker, the DCS and her parents, Lavonne and John Kelley. 'It was almost like a perfect storm,' she told the Star. 'Nobody did the right thing for this child, or at least enough of the right things.' The DCS case worker, Teresa Carter, said she was shocked when she learned about the conditions because when she visited six days earlier, the home was in good condition and the girl had smiled. But after the death, she returned to the home and found it covered with dog feces, trash, soiled adult diapers and cigarette butts and saw bugs crawling through the refrigerator. She also learned that Linda had sores below her waist. An autopsy is still being conducted into the cause of the teenager's death, but Moores said she suffered from sepsis. Carer: The girl lived with her mother, Lavonne Kelley (pictured), and her father. Neither have been charged - and it is not known if they knew about the sores on the girl's legs - but police are investigating . 'How could that have happened in less than a week's time?' she said, the Indy Star reported. At the hearing, she admitted she had only checked some rooms in the house and did not check the Linda's legs for sores. She knew the girl had previously suffered a leg injury but after it healed, she did not see the need to continue to check her legs, she said. Carter said that she had been handling up to 28 cases at the time, whereas the legal limit in Indiana is 17. She explained that she was unable to keep up and could not sleep at night. But the DCS, which fired Carter and her supervisor after Linda passed away, said that workload was not a valid excuse for the oversights, and that the visits should have been carried out more thoroughly. The department had a long relationship with the Kelleys, who reportedly neglected their children in 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2012. In December, the DCS learned the couple had failed to take their daughter to doctors appointments, including for a sore on her leg. When they checked the home at the time, it was filthy, records show. The department entered into a judge-approved agreement with the family to clean up the conditions and attend all doctors' appointments. Loss: The 18-year-old had smiled at her case worker during the visit and the reports noted that the home was in good condition. Less than a week later, she was found dead in a feces-covered home . The couple apparently met the terms of their agreement and the case closed in mid-July, although Carter and Damar Services workers went for the final meeting on July 29. The president of Damar Services, Jim Dalton, said his workers had never seen the home in such a terrible condition as on the day she died and that if they had, they would have reported it. No charges have been brought in the case, although police are investigating. An attorney for the girl's parents told the Indy Star that they are devastated by the death. Both fired DCS employees are appealing their terminations.","Linda Kelley, who had spina bifida, had sores covering much of her lower body when she passed away in her parents' Indiana home in August .

"Accusations: Two New York police officers have been charged with sexual assault following an incident at the Trump Taj Mahal hotel in Atlantic City . Two police officers from New York have been charged with sexually assaulting a woman in an Atlantic City casino. Lawyers for both men say the men are innocent. Andrei Torres, an officer at the New York Police Department, and Devon Thomas, of the New York state police, were charged Tuesday with aggravated sexual assault and sexual assault by force without injury. Atlantic City Police Sgt. Monica McMenamin says Andrei Torres was arraigned in Queens County Criminal Court on Wednesday, and Devon Thomas was arraigned in West Chester County, New York. Both waived extradition hearings and were expected to be taken to New Jersey later in the day. They turned themselves in to their department's internal affairs bureaus Tuesday. Authorities have not detailed the allegations, and Jay McKeen, a spokesman for the Atlantic County Prosecutor's Office, said he would not say anything about the case other than that charges had been filed. The alleged assault was at the Trump Taj Mahal on April 24 against a woman also from New York state. 'Mr. Thomas is 100 percent innocent,' said Thomas' lawyer, Joseph Levine. 'He does not engage in any criminal wrongdoing, especially nothing of a sexual nature.' Torres' lawyer, John Zarych said the evidence would prove his client innocent. 'This is a mistake, a mistake we will correct as soon as possible,' Zarych said. 'He's an excellent officer with the NYPD and is just simply innocent of these charges.' Their lawyers said both men served in the U.S. military in Iraq and that Thomas also served in Afghanistan.","NYPD officer Andrei Torres and New York state police officer Devon Thomas were charged Tuesday with sexual assault .

"They have been a constant on motorways and building sites for more than two decades - and now the hi-vis jacket is heading for a fashion upgrade. A modern take on the safety wear that makes garments visible from 1.5miles away in complete darkness has been unveiled. The technologically-enhanced makeover of the building site staple uses a concealed battery to light up bright strips on the clothing that can be seen from long distances. The technology uses a battery hidden inside the clothing which lights up reflective strips and can be seen for 1.5 miles . Fhoss, the company behind the clothing, is now making 5,000 products a month, including jackets, trousers and shoes . Bosses at Network Rail, London Underground and infrastructure giant Balfour Beatty have already snapped up the items of clothing for use on their work sites. Fhoss, the company behind the high tech clothing, claims its products could revolutionise workplace safety and save the lives of those working in dangerous situations. Traditional hi-vis clothing uses reflective material that first requires light to be shone on it before it works. But by incorporating battery-powered strips on top of normal reflective material, the manufacturers claim that their jackets will be significantly harder to miss. Wet weather also reduces the visibility of traditional clothing by up to 70 per cent, while the powered jackets do not lose any effectiveness in adverse conditions, it is claimed. Andrew Kimitri, the man behind the company that started in November last year, has patented the technology and has his eyes on claiming a large stake of the multi-billion personal protective equipment market. The Weston-super-Mare business is already producing 5,000 pieces of clothing a month and has designed trousers and shoes that also use the technology. The company claims its jackets do not lose visibility in wet conditions, unlike traditional reflective hi-vis clothing . Inventor Andrew Kimitri initially thought of the product as a way to make doormen at hotels, bars and nightclubs to stand out . The clothing uses electroluminescent technology connected to a battery that provides 15 hours of light before recharging. A hidden battery in the clothing lights up bright strips on normal reflective material that can be seen up to 1.5miles away. The battery, connected to electroluminescent technology, provides 15 hours of continuous light. Unlike normal hi-vis clothing, the products are equally effective in adverse weather conditions. The clothing can also be machine washed 25 times - 15 more than standard hi-vis. Mr Kimitri, 40, initially thought of the idea while working in the hotel industry and nightclub industry. He said: ‘I’ve spent 20 years running hotels, bars and nightclubs. Doormen don’t tend to stand out; they look like anyone. I wanted to help distinguish the security personnel in case of an emergency.’ Mr Kimitri spent three years developing the idea, eventually realising that the concept easily leant itself to the safety clothing industry. He said: ‘High–vis clothing hasn’t changed for 20 years. The main achievement was to get a battery on a man. ‘When I started the business, a rival asked, ""Are you the fool that wants to put lighting onto a high–vis vest?""' After securing £750,000 in funding, the company is already enjoying success and is importing products to America, Australia and Europe. The businessman also said that he envisages runners and cyclists using the technology in the future, with the company hoping to make a turnover of £3million this year.","Concealed battery illuminates strips for up to 15 hours of continuous light .

"The parents of murdered bride Anni Dewani have spoken out, condemning her husband Shrien over their daughter's killing. After watching the British millionaire take the stand in South African yesterday, Anni's parents, father Vinod Hindocha and his wife Nilam, have said that regardless of the courts findings, their son-in-law is responsible. Mr Hindocha said Dewani was guilty the moment he abandoned Anni in a taxi and left her to the mercy of hijackers when the pair were meant to be enjoying their honeymoon together. Scroll down for video . The parents of murdered bride, Anni Dewani, pictured above with her husband Shiren Dewani, have said their son-in-law is responsible for their daughters death regardless of the courts findings . Anni's mother Nilam, right, and sister, Ami, and her father Vinod leave the court in South Africa yesterday . Mr Hindocha and his wife Nilam said that regardless of the court's findings they think Dewani is responsible for their daughter's death because he left her at the mercy of their hijackers . Mr Hindocha and his wife, who are pictured with a picture of Anni as a girl, said their daughter comes to them in their dreams seeking justice, and that they hope the trial will finally offer them closure . He told The Sun: 'It's up to the courts to decide if he is guilty or not. But in our eyes he was guilty the moment he left Anni. He should have fought for my daughter.' Dewani has denied involvement in his wife's murder, saying that he was forced from the taxi he was sharing with Anni by robbers as they drove through a crime-ridden area of Cape Town. She was found dead from a gunshot wound to the neck hours later. The prosecution says the 34-year-old paid hitmen £1,200 to kill Anni during the fake robbery organised by his taxi driver Zola Tongo. Mr Hindocha refuses to accept Dewani's version of events. He said: 'Anni was his wife, his newlywed. The man holding the gun was half his weight and half his strength. He could have overpowered him or offered him more money.' Yesterday Anni's family, including her older sister Ami and other family members, gasped in court as pictures from the murder scene were shown, and Dewani revealed he was bisexual and had used male prostitutes. Shrien Dewani on the stand in South Africa where he has admitted being bisexual and to using male prostitutes . Anni and Dewani met through mutual friends on holiday in the UK and married in Mumbai, India in October 2010 . But for Mr Hindocha, the proceeding offered some relief. He said: 'For the past few years we haven't been able to start the mourning process. There's been no rest. 'For as long as this trial has been hanging over us, Anni has still been alive. But now we are so relieved to be moving towards being able to grieve for our daughter.' Three South African men have already been jailed over Anni's murder. Mr Hindocha said for too long the case has centred on Dewani, and not what happened to Anni. He said Anni came to him every night in his dreams, asking for justice. Mr Hindocha hoped the trial would turn the 'torture' of the last few years into the 'closure' the family needed. Home tycoon Dewani and Swedish-born Anni met through mutual friends on holiday in the UK and had a long-distance relationship for 18 months. They then married in a lavish ceremony in Mumbai, India in October 2010. Three days into their honeymoon Anni was killed. On the stand yesterday, Dewani confessed to sleeping with Leopold Leisser – nicknamed the German Master – and other escorts he had met online or in gay clubs. Dewani suggested the sex with men was merely a question of physical encounters with virtual strangers. He said: ‘My sexual interactions with males were mostly physical experiences or email chats with people I met online or in clubs, including prostitutes such as Leopold Leisser. ‘My sexual interactions with females were usually during the course of a relationship which consisted of other activities and emotional attachment.’ Leisser, who is expected to be a prosecution witness, has told how he met the tycoon for drug-fuelled sex games three times during the build-up to the latter’s wedding. Dewani, from Bristol, is said to have begged him to humiliate and racially abuse him. Dewani told how a few months after meeting his future wife he had testosterone replacement therapy because of ‘abnormally low hormone levels’ which he was warned might have harmed his chances of fatherhood. Dewani and Anni together on their honeymoon in South Africa in 2010, days before Anni was shot dead . But he insisted he was instantly physically attracted to his wife when they first met in May 2009, and he sensed there was a mutual chemistry. Dewani, who is being held at Cape Town’s Valkenberg psychiatric hospital, appeared distracted for much of the hearing yesterday. The court heard the couple's relationship was marred with conflicts from the very beginning. Dewani said: ‘We were both headstrong and often argued with each other.' The couple went on separate holidays at the end of 2009 and, in January 2010, Anni ended the relationship by email. However, they were back together within two months and began planning a future together, including designing their Bristol and London properties with custom-made ‘his and hers’ wardrobes. But a few weeks later, in May 2010, they had another row and Anni phoned him in an ‘angry frame of mind’. He responded with a letter saying: ‘If you really think being with me is not going to make you happy then this is not right for you. ‘I really hope that is not what you are saying but I don’t want to feel like I have forced you into something.’ Dewani said the couple made up after she assured him that she wanted to marry him, despite some misgivings. The following month he flew her to Paris in a private jet and proposed. She accepted but their problems continued as they planned their wedding in India. They argued over everything from the colour of the decorations to the clothes they should wear. The disagreements culminated in Anni storming out of a hotel they were staying in. Dewani said: ‘She sent me a text to say that she could no longer go through with the wedding and wanted to call it off. ‘She said that I was too controlling and that I involved myself too much in all of the detail.’ Dewani said they eventually made up because ‘we agreed that whilst at times we really frustrated each other, we were in love and we wanted to be together’.","Anni Dewani's parents have said her husband should never have left Anni .

"Eight families were evacuated from their homes to escape a major rat infestation after vermin were spotted running through kitchen cupboards. The plague of rats wreaked havoc by gnawing through water pipes and electrical wires, causing leaks and power cuts at the properties on The Whithys in Street, Somerset. The five-year infestation was so severe that repairmen at the housing association homes refused to enter, furious tenants claimed as they were moved to temporary houses, . Eight families were evacuated from their homes after a five-year rat infestation, which caused major damage to homes as rats burrowed through walls . The plague of rats terrorised families by working their way behind walls and setting up home (inside of rat hole pictured), before gnawing through into kitchen cupboards . Eight homes on The Whithys (pictured), in Street, Somerset, were infested with rats for up to five years . Mother of two Jodi Scanlan, 22, said the vermin infested every part of her home and could be heard scurrying through the walls. She saw them at the back of kitchen cupboards and said that she lost hundreds of pounds worth of food to the rodents. Miss Scanlan and her neighbour even lost running water to the property after the rats gnawed through her pipes. She said: 'In the last year and a half it has got to the point where they have been in every nook and cranny of my house. 'I had no water at one point, no working smoke alarms and it got to the stage that my electrics were going out every 20 minutes because they had chewed through the wires. 'I didn't feel safe, my children were terrified and it was dangerous and completely unsanitary. The rats caused major damage to the homes, including cutting off water and electricity by chewing through pipes and wires . After a five-year battle, the housing association which owns the homes has agreed to re-home the families affected while they carry out repairs caused by the rodents . 'Every day there were just more and more and more rats, you shouldn't have to get accustomed to seeing rats in your home but I did - and that's awful. 'My children could hear them in the walls at night - fighting, squeaking, moving around - and they were terrified. 'I have a 22-month-old baby. I've had to bring him up in that home because I've had no choice.' The terrified mother said she first spotted rats in her home, owned by Knightstone Housing Association, in 2009, just months after she first moved in with her fiance Dominic Thrower and their now six-year-old son Nicky Thrower. Despite complaining to Knightstone, she claims the association told her pest control was her responsibility. Miss Scanlan said: 'The rats bit through plumbing pipes, and every time I flushed my toilet, it leaked through the ceiling. 'They ate through water pipes and I couldn't use the washing machine and the dishwasher any more. There was a problem with my lights - they kept tripping all the time. 'We called Knightstone and they sent a contractor out to carry out some repairs. They refused to set foot in the house because of the infestation. 'The electricians that looked at our lights got straight on the phone to the association and told them the houses weren't safe, that they needed to get us all out of there immediately. 'But it was still almost two weeks before they found us somewhere else to live.' 'We've been treated like idiots. It should never have been allowed to get like this.' A mother living in one of the infested homes described her family's living situation as 'dangerous and completely unsanitary' Knightstone have since re-homed the eight families affected, who have been told that they do not have to move back in once repairs have been made. The Environment Agency also discovered a ditch used by Wessex Water as an overflow for raw sewage less than two metres from one of the families' homes. Ammonia levels in the ditch have been linked to three of the residents who lived nearby contracting pneumonia - one of which was Jodi's son Nicky. Mark Beard, from Knightstone Housing Association, said: 'We are so sorry that residents ended up in such circumstances. 'As soon as we realised the extent of the problem at The Whithys, in September this year, we worked with the residents of the eight affected properties to find them immediate and suitable alternative housing. 'We moved people out so that we could carry out deep and effective rat treatment to eradicate the problem. 'We have given all the residents the choice not to return to The Whithys. 'We are sure these houses can be kept free of pests now and we are working with the responsible authorities to ensure they are doing what they need to do to prevent the problem recurring as well. 'Like all landlords, we give residents advice on the treatment of pests, so they are equipped to deal with most issues that may arise. In this instance, the pests got too much for the usual domestic treatments which we advise residents to use.'","A plague of rats infested eight Somerset homes and terrorised families .

"Rap music mogul Marion 'Suge' Knight has been hospitalized after suffering two falls behind bars last week in Las Vegas. Attorneys Richard Schonfeld and Julie Raye said Monday that Knight is being treated for a painful bruise on the back of his neck and head after falling Thursday while doctors were checking him for dizziness and chest pain. Judge Joe M. Bonaventure set bail at $75,000 pending Knight's return to California to face a felony robbery charge that could represent a third-strike felony for Knight. The 49-year-old founder of Death Row Records was arrested Wednesday in Las Vegas and comedian Katt Williams was arrested in the Los Angeles area on a celebrity photographer's complaint that they stole her camera September 5 in Beverly Hills. Suge Knight has been hospitalized since last week, when he suffered two falls while behind bars in Las Vegas. Above,  Knight appears in  court on Thursday, October 30 . Sources told TMZ that Knight took two falls behind bars. Once in his cell and again while getting an x-ray in the medical ward. After the second fall, Knight's lawyer had him transferred to a local hospital. Sources went on to tell TMZ that they believe his illness is being caused by a blood clot in his lung. Knight has allegedly been on a heavy dose of blood thinners ever since he was shot in August at a pre-Video Music Awards party hosted by Chris Brown. However, Knight was reportedly not able to take the medication behind bars and that was what caused the clot. Allegations: Knight (left, in February 2003) and Comedian Katt Williams (right in April 2013) were arrested and charged with one county of robbery on Wednesday, October 29 after a paparazzo reported the men stole her camera in Beverly Hills, California on September 5 . Ill health: Knight was behind bars at the Clark County Detention Center (pictured) when he fainted twice last week. After the second fall, Knight's attorney had him transferred to a local hospital .

"They had been dating for less than three months but 39-year-old Dan Shearin made his 21-year-old girlfriend Breeana Robinson’s life hell, with her devastated family describing the convicted criminal as ‘not human… he’s the devil.’ The family of 'Bree', who died in January 2013, allege convicted Shearin is trying to seize Ms Robinson’s superannuation funds. Shearin is allegedly claiming he and Ms Robinson were in a defacto relationship, despite only living together for 38 days before her tragic death. ‘I (am) really angry, especially with this court case going on and him pleading guilty to how he treated her,’ her mother, Elaine Robinson told A Current Affair. ‘But he’s still wanting to take her money. I’m disgusted.’ Scroll down for video . Dan Shearin (right) was sentence to six months behind bars on Monday over the death of his girlfriend Breeana Robinson, who fell to her death in January 2013 . Breeana Robinson's devastated mother Elaine has spoken out about the trauma of losing her daughter and the disgust she has towards Dan Shearin . Breeana Robinson, pictured left in both images, was bombarded with 1439 text messages by ex-boyfriend Dan Shearin in the month before she took her own life . On Tuesday, Shearin was sentenced to six months in jail, after pleading guilty to using a carriage service to menace or harass earlier this month. Cheerleader Breeana Robinson, 21, fell from the balcony of the Gold Coast high-rise apartment of her controlling, obsessive boyfriend, Dan Shearin, a court heard earlier this month. Shearin bombarded his girlfriend with 1439 text messages degrading, the last of which she received ten minutes before her death, which is thought to have been a suicide, a Southport Magistrate's Court heard earlier this month. Ms Robinson’s grieving family are speaking out for the first time about the agony of the 21-year-old's death and their anger towards the man that ‘manipulated’ her. ‘Bree had never heard of him before, he approached her on Facebook,' said her mother. ‘He said that he was 28 with no children and worked in the cruiseline industry. ‘He turned out to be 38, with a daughter and was packing shelves at Coles.’ An image of Dan Shearin (far left) with Breeana Robinson (centre), captured by Ms Robinson's aunty at a family function . Breeana Robinson's heartbroken brother Matt (left) and mother Elaine (right) are speaking out . The cheeleader, who was legally blind from a young age, had been drawn to the former cruise ship entertainer through his promises of helping her realise her dreams of a dancing career. ‘He manipulated, he told her everything she wanted to hear,’ explained Ms Robinson’s aunt, Janine Mackney. Less than two months after they started dating, the young girl moved in with the much older man, despite her family’s pleas. Her family had never trusted Shearin, but had no idea how twisted and abusive his behaviour could be, nor the shattering impact it was having on their beloved ‘Bree’. ‘He called her a retarded s***,’ her brother Matt Robinson told A Current Affair. ‘It’s just repulsive, you read it back now and it just makes you feel so guilty that you didn’t do more to stop it.’ Yet the response from the young girl to her boyfriend’s abuse was always the same and always heartbreaking: an apology, even if it wasn't her fault. Shearin’s past girlfriends have come forward, with the family disturbed to have received messages from 38 people telling sad stories about the nightmare they lived because of the same man. Four years ago Trish (surname withheld) dated Shearin, and claims to have experienced a torrent of verbal abuse and foreceful behaviour. Breanna Robinson (back right) pictured two weeks before her death with her aunt Janine Mackney (front) Home video footage from 1996 of convicted criminal Dan Shearin with his now 19-year-old daughter . ‘His explanation for being like that was that he can’t win in a fight but he can kill anyone with this words,’ Trish told A Current Affair. Sonia, the mother of Shearin’s 19-year-old daughter, recalls being told 'really hurtful things' and that she began to believe them. She also alleges that Shearin threw her down the stairs. When asked if she surprised by Ms Robinson’s death, she tearfully admits, ‘no.’ Breeana Robinson, 21, pictured with boyfriend and cruise ship entertainer Dan Shearin . Ms Robinson's family carried pink flowers into court on Monday to show their support for the woman . When Sheiran was convicted, friends and family of Ms Robinson attended court, wearing pink and handing out flowers of the same colour in support of the 21-year-old. Supporters also carried pictures of the young cheerleader, who had dreams of becoming a dancer despite having been legally blind since a young age. In the 38 days Ms Robinson was with Shearin before she fell to her death he sent her 1439 text messages,At 10.35pm on January 29, 2013 after she returned from cheerleading practice Ms Robinson fell from their luxury apartment, H20 Broadwater in the Gold Coast suburb of Southport. Earlier this month the cruise ship entertainer (right) pleaded guilty to using a carriage service to menace or harass . The cheerleader's family also handed out the flowers to other attendees in a show of solidarity . The athletic, but slight, young woman fell the eleven storeys on to a Perspex awning above the shops and restaurants at the base of the iconic building. The court heard evidence that in one text message sent to Ms Robinson ten minutes before she died, Shearin said: 'You're more interested in TV, food and everything else but your partner. That's why everything's ruined. Your priorities are f***ed up'. In another text message sent to Breanna that was heard in court, Shearin said: 'You're a complete f***ing moron. I don't want a stupid, dumb c***'. Shearin, who friends of Ms Robinson's said is obsessed with Facebook and dating sites, has called girls 'bitches' and a 'psycho' on another of his Facebook pages. Horror scene: Ms Robinson fell from their luxury H20 Broadwater complex in Southport, on the Gold Coast . On September 21, he posted, 'Haha. I love jealous bitches who can't handle rejection. One has set up an account on grindr with my phone number thinking that it might somehow embarrass me. 'Talk about psycho just coz she couldn't f*** me lol. She is so stupid that she doesn't realise that it is a criminal offence these days.' Friends of Ms Robinson told Daily Mail Australia how the 'lovely young woman' who had struggled at school because of a chronic astigmatism called 'cat's eye', would have done anything to become a dancer. 'She believed Dan would help her achieve that goal,' the friend said, on condition of anonymity. 'She was the sweetest, kindest person, unaffected and always apologising,' the friend said. Following Ms Robinson's death, Shearin moved from the H20 apartment block and is now believed to be working for a Gold Coast time share company.

"A primatologist has demonstrated her commitment to her job as well as her fiancée by getting married in a treehouse. Olivia Haggis and her new husband Charles-Albert Petre tied the knot in the magnificent giant oak structure before jetting off just eight days later to study chimps in the remote Congolese jungle. Sticking with the unconventional theme, they continued monkeying around by planting a tree and having 'Monkey Song' played during the ceremony. The two primate lovers incorporated their passion for monkeys into their special day, even playing the 'Monkey Song' during the ceremony . Olivia, an expert on neuroscience chose the treehouse venue to reflect her love of nature . The happy couple planted a tree to commemorate their special day (left) as well as enjoying more traditional celebrations like a champagne toast (right) Olivia, 33, from Devon said: 'When we saw the tree house had a license for civil marriages we just knew it was the perfect place for our big day.' The scientist - an expert on neuroscience - wanted a venue to reflect her love of nature. So, instead of settling for a traditional church service or remote beach wedding, she spent months hunting for the ideal place to get married. But by the time she finally found the perfect location the bride had just eight weeks to plan the wedding. She and new husband Charles-Albert, 33, from Belgium, were joined by 14 guests seated on the balcony outside as the registrar pronounced them man and wife. Olivia has previously worked in Madagascar studying lemurs and Cameroon following gorillas. Along with her conservationist husband, she's now in the Congo studying Bonobos - a type of chimp - for the WWF on a two year project. The couple are the first to get married in the luxury treetop house - normally an unusual holiday home - at the Fox and Hounds hotel in Chulmleigh, Devon. After the ceremony the dedicated couple left the UK to study chimps in the remote Congolese jungle . The couple say it would be their dream to live in a treehouse in the jungle among the monkeys . Olivia said: 'We only had eight weeks before leaving for Africa and had almost given up finding the perfect setting. 'When I found the treehouse I knew I'd found the place - the location up in the branches of a stunning oak tree couldn't have been more appropriate. 'It just seemed perfect for us as we both love nature. 'We met while working in the forest in Cameroon and would love to build and live in a tree house in Africa in the future. Olivia, pictured in the forest in Cameroon, has worked in Madagascar with lemurs and Cameroon with gorillas . The couple are the first to get married in the luxury treetop house - normally an unusual holiday home - at the Fox and Hounds hotel in Chulmleigh, Devon . 'As primatologists living up in the trees with the monkeys would be ideal!' Mother of the bride Amanda Haggis, 67, said: 'It was a brilliant day - Olivia couldn't have found a better location. 'She's always been interested in primates and Africa and She just wanted something different so it was perfect coincidence. 'She's been all over the world, sometimes chasing gorillas or studying lemurs so a treehouse where everything is made out of wood was perfect.' Gill Churchill who runs the events at The Fox and Hounds hotel helped the couple put the finishing touches to their wedding. She said: 'We were delighted to be able to host such a special day in our brand new tree house and the tree planting means Olivia and Charles-Albert will always be part of this amazing space.'","Couple met while working in the forest in Cameroon .

"As the average Aussie enjoys their Labour Day long weekend, they have also been invited to celebrate a range of careers that thankfully no longer require employees. In tribute to the introduction of an eight hour working day more than 60 years ago, Ancestry.com.au has also revealed that one in six Australians are working in a job which didn't exist 20 years ago. The website's senior content director, Ben Mercer, told Daily Mail Australia that technology has largely led to the change in career opportunities. Ancestry.com.au has released a list of Australian occupations that no longer exist to celebrate the Labour Day long weekend. Pictured: Ice delivery men were replaced by domestic fridges in Australia in the 1950s . Lamp lighters (left)  would manually light, fuel and extinguish street lamps until the introduction of electrical streetlights in Sydney in 1904. Knocker uppers (right) were hired to wake people up in the morning using sticks or pebbles  until alarm clocks became affordable in the early 20th century . 'Interestingly in the past you had a lot of individuals employed in certain trades that don't exist now,' Mr Mercer said. 'Jobs in communications such as a social media manager, or in technology, that didn't exist 10 or 20 years ago...we are now seeing a digital revolution.' The 'revolution' can certainly be admired when remembering the role of the iconic Australian Bullocky who was employed to take food and station supplies to isolated  country areas in the 19th century, or even the lamp lighter whose nocturnal life was ruled by his role to manually light and fuel street lamps before extinguishing them at sunrise. But it was some of the other formerly necessary jobs - such as the trade of the ice delivery man, who were finally replaced by refrigerators in the 1950s in Australia, or the dunny man, who would ensure your outhouse was empty by morning - that are certainly not missed by Australian workers today. The iconic Australian Bullocky took food and station supplies to isolated country areas in the 19th century . During the industrial revolution, rat catchers were  paid a small fee for each dead rat they handed in to help stem the threat of infections. They used  traps or specially bred terrier dogs but were made redundant after the invention of rat poison in the early 1900's . Drovers were employed to drive livestock from horseback over long distances. It became less and less common as trains were used to move livestock in the 1860’s, almost completely disappearing after trucks began moving livestock in 1960s . Be they inviting career paths or not, research by Ancestory.com.au found that more than 20 per cent of the 1000 Australians that were surveyed admitted that they or their siblings have chosen to work in the same occupation as their parents or grandparent at some stage in their life. For that reason, the website has provided free access to over 117 million records until the end of the long weekend for those who are interested in the occupations of the people in their family tree. 'So many people come to us to talk about what their grandmother or grandfather did for a job,' Mr Mercer said. 'The research asked 1000 ordinary Australians how they feel about their jobs. A significant percentage said they still work in the same job (as their ancestors) but we found a lot of people (67 per cent) wouldn't encourage the same career path as their children.' Switchboard operators used to  connect calls until as recently as the 1960s by inserting a pair of phone plugs into the appropriate cell. Today this is done digitally . Town husbands were people employed by the parish to collect money from the fathers of illegitimate children for their upkeep . 'I think it is a real desire in parents to see their kids do what they want to do.' Despite the holiday still being widely celebrated with an extra day off of work each year, Mr Mercer revealed that 50 per cent of Aussies reported they are still working more than eight hours a day. 'Labour Day originally started as a protest to the 10-12 hour day, 6 days a week in the 1850s, 60, 70s. In 1948 it was reduced to 5 days a week,' he said. 'Now we are seeing a total turn around again - everyone is working 10-12 hours.'

"Mario John Lopez, 26 (pictured), robbed a bride and groom on their wedding day this week. He was arrested a day later by Broward County, Florida police . Like many couples, Nathan Brooks and Julia Martinez couldn't sleep the night before their wedding - though not for nerves. The couple spent the whole night filing police reports and going to the hospital after being attacked by a robber in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. As a sign of their commitment, the attack did not delay their wedding despite the newlyweds having to post for pictures with bruised faces. 'We didn't let this stop us from getting married. We're happy. Our wedding was fantastic,' Mr Brooks, 26, told the Sun-Sentinel. The groom was returning to his hotel from Tropic Cay Sports Bar just after 3am on Monday when he was approached by a man on the street who robbed him at gunpoint. 'I just saw the gun and I said, ""Take whatever you want,"" and he started beating me,' Mr Brooks recalled. The robber hit the groom in the face with his gun, knocking him over and beat Mr Brooks as he lay on the ground. All the while he sifted through Mr Brooks' pockets, stealing cash and a cellphone. Worried about her soon-to-be husband's whereabouts, 33-year-old bride Julia Martinez and mother of the groom Sherrie Geisler, 51, went outside to search for Mr Brooks and found him in the street. They also came upon the robber, who pointed  his gun at the bride who pleaded for her life. That move led Geisler to jump on the gunman, who went on to pistol whip both women, stealing their cash and another cellphone. 'Luckily everyone survived,' Mr Brooks said. While both women refused treatment for their injuries, the groom was taken to Broward Health Medical Center where he was treated for stitches. He also came away from the fight with a broken nose, two black eyes, a chipped tooth, scrapes and bruises. Nathan Brooks was returning from a sports bar at this Fort Lauderdale hotel the morning of his wedding when he encountered Lopez and was beaten . He was released from the hospital around 10am that morning, and returned to his hotel to get ready for his 3:30pm wedding at the Coral Gables courthouse. After the ceremony, the wedding party went to the Atlantic Hotel for a dinner reception. 'Me and my family and my wife and my friends — besides the injuries and being sore and getting beat up — at the end of the day, we had a great time,' Mr Brooks said. 'The ceremony was excellent. The photos are the only downside.' Investigators identified the robber as Mario John Lopez, 26, who they were able to track down the following day. Around 9:30pm on Tuesday, officers spotted Lopez in Davie, Florida, and he fled into a field in an attempt to evade arrest. Officers sent a police dog after the robber, who choked the dog until police were able to separate the two. The dog survived the attack and is now recovering. Lopez was arrested and charged with three robberies with a firearm, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon and resisting arrest with violence and battery on a police dog. He was denied bail at a Wednesday afternoon hearing, the same day Mr and Mrs Brooks set sail on their Bahamas cruise honeymoon. 'They got the guy. That's the most important thing,' Mr Brooks said. 'One bad guy is off the streets. I'm glad they got him. At least he doesn't have the opportunity to kill someone or do this to someone else.'","Nathan Brooks, 26, was returning from a sports bar at 3am Monday morning when a robber beat him up, stealing his cash and cellphone .

"Assault: Fletcher began binge drinking to cope with emotional distress, magistrates were told . A transgender woman attacked a paramedic with a shampoo bottle in an unprovoked mid-afternoon assault. Leyla Fletcher, 36, Standing trial as Kevin Fletcher, struck the worker on the head before kicking him after being found stricken in Manchester city centre. Ambulance service bosses have now slammed her sentence after she escaped with a three year conditional discharge. Fletcher has been attempting to undergo gender reassignment surgery for the last 12 years, a court heard. However after several failed attempts she began binge drinking to cope with the emotional distress, magistrates were told. The emergency services were called to St Mary's Parsonage in the city centre at around 1pm on a Thursday afternoon earlier this month to reports a woman was having a fit. They found Fletcher on the floor though after checking her over they found she wasn't fitting, Tess Kenyon, prosecuting said. They then put her in a wheelchair and put her into the ambulance which is where she launched the attack on paramedic Philip Ogden. She threw a bottle of shampoo she had bought earlier that day at him, hitting him on the head, before kicking out and hitting him in the shin. Police were called and she was arrested. She admitted to officers that she had been drinking red wine and couldn't remember much about the incident. Fletcher, of Salford, pleaded guilty to assault at Manchester Magistrates court. Lyndsey Brown, defending, said Mitchell had been the victim of a brutal attack herself, as well as abuse from people living near her, and her mother had disowned her. She said: 'I hope you could take the view that this was a one-off and that the defendant will never be before the court again. 'It has been a hard period of time and she has drank to excess. 'But things are now moving, her gender reassignment has started. It's in the early stages and there are many years ahead.' Slammed: An ambulance official said: 'The Trust is extremely disappointed with the sentence given to the perpetrator in this instance' Fletcher has been attempting to undergo gender reassignment surgery for the last 12 years, Manchester Magistrate's Court heard . She was handed a conditional discharge by magistrates, meaning she will not be punished unless she commits any more offences, despite having a previous conviction for assault. Chairman of the bench Terri Farrow said: 'Normally this offence would carry a community order. 'However given your personal difficulties and everything you have been through and are still to go through, we are going to impose a conditional discharge.' She was also ordered to pay £200 compensation to her victim, as well as £85 costs and a £25 victim surcharge. Speaking after the hearing, Director of Emergency Service for North West Ambulance Service, Derek Cartwright said: 'The Trust is extremely disappointed with the sentence given to the perpetrator in this instance. 'Our message is that we will always push for those who assault crews to receive the maximum sentence allowed. 'It's unfortunate that hasn't happened in this case.'","Ambulance was called for Leyla Fletcher, 36, after she was found in street .

She is said to have left him for a new man, two years after he and David Norris were convicted and jailed for the racist murder of teenager Stephen in 1993. A message posted to Facebook on Dobson's behalf, seen by the Sunday Mirror, said he and Michelle had broken up 'amicably'. 'She has since met somebody,' the message continued. 'A fellow who I kind of knew and got on well with. As for names and details they are to remain private. Thank you, Gary.' Dobson and Ms Lines, both 39, lived in Swanley, Kent, with their two sons, now aged eight and six, as well as a child from Dobson's previous relationship. During his Old Bailey trial she was a regular in the public gallery, waving lovingly at Dobson; and as the jury prepared to consider their verdict, he blew a kiss to her. Dobson was first arrested 15 days after Stephen Lawrence was chased down and stabbed to death in the street in Eltham, south-east London. He was one of five white youths, all alleged to be members of the same street gang, who were charged with Stephen's murder, but the charges were then subsequently dropped by the CPS. Murdered: Dobson was first arrested 15 days after Stephen Lawrence was chased down and stabbed to death . Famous front page: The Mail openly accused the suspects in Stephen's killing and dared them to sue . When Stephen's parents Doreen and Neville Lawrence launched their own private prosecution in 1994, Dobson was among the three acquitted of murder at the Old Bailey. Also jailed: David Norris, another of the original five suspects, is serving 14 years behind bars for his part in Stephen's murder . On 14 February 1997, on a famous front page, the Daily Mail labelled Dobson, Norris and three other suspects 'murderers'. The headline read, 'Murderers: The Mail accuses these men of killing. If we are wrong, let them sue us.' Beneath it appeared pictures of Dobson, Norris, Neil and Jamie Acourt, and Luke Knight. None of the men ever sued for defamation and strong public opinions rose against the accused and the police who handled the case. In 1999 the McPherson report into the Metropolitan Police's handling of the case found a litany of failures and accused the force of 'institutional racism'. Dobson worked as a bricklayer and labourer at building sites across London, but at the time of his re-arrest for Stephen's murder he was serving a five-year sentence for drug dealing. He was finally convicted in 2007, after a cold case review found 'new and substantial evidence' and his original acquittal was quashed in the court of appeal. He is now serving a minimum of 15 years behind bars, while Norris serves a minimum of 14 years, for what the judge described as a 'terrible and evil crime'. Stephen's mother Doreen was made a Labour peer last year in recognition of her long-running fight for justice for her son.","Michelle Lines and Gary Dobson were together for ten years .

"A teacher who sent lewd texts to a schoolboy who later killed himself has been banned from the classroom indefinitely - the toughest sanction he could have faced. Iwan Harding, 35, was teaching at the village school at Glan Conwy, near Colwyn Bay in North Wales, when it was discovered he was swapping obscene messages with a teenage father. Anthony Stubbs, 17, was later found hanged in woodland after his girlfriend Charlotte Mason, 18, found the messages he had been exchanging with Mr Harding. Iwan Harding, pictured left and right, has been banned from the classroom indefinitely after a probe by the General Teaching Council for Wales over indecent messages he sent to teenage father Anthony Stubbs, 17 . Anthony Stubbs hanged himself after girlfriend Charlotte Mason, pictured with baby Lily, found the messages . Mr Harding claimed he thought the boy was 18 and a prefect in a Lancashire school when he started swapping texts 'of a sexually explicit nature' by mobile phone with him. The General Teaching Council for Wales found Mr Harding guilty of unprofessional conduct falling short of the standard expected of a teacher. He did not appear and was not represented. Chairman Peter Williams said Mr Harding had appeared to be in denial about the gravity of his unprofessional conduct and there had been only a limited expression of remorse. Sending such messages 'of a deeply sexual nature' was an abuse of his position of trust. The prohibition order was 'to maintain public trust and confidence and to protect the interest of pupils, the public and the profession'. Anthony Stubbs set up a profile on dating website Love Leap as 'young, sexy gay', and met Mr Harding online . According to the presenting officer, Emma Burns, of 77 texts sent between October 7 and November 24 in 2012, about 25 were of a sexual nature, eight of them sent in school hours. Miss Burns said Harding had said he never knew Anthony's name and believed he was 18. He admitted sending one image which he said he obtained on Google, but Anthony was not a pupil of his and he did not consider it was unprofessional conduct. Mr Harding said he later learned Anthony was 17 and the sexual texts stopped. He regarded what had happened 'as a private conversation between himself and another person'. Denise Machin, Anthony's mother, holds a portrait of her son who took his own life in January 2013 . 'I created a persona, I just wanted to chat ... it was just a bit of fun, there was no breach of trust, he was not my pupil, no duty of care.' Miss Burns said Mr Harding was no longer a teacher but his present occupation was not known. Head teacher Mrs Eifiona Price-Williams said Mr Harding had been sacked following a disciplinary hearing and an appeal was withdrawn. 'When interviewed he explained he had never met the man, it was a website. He did not know he was 17.' Ms Williams said Anthony was being referred to throughout the case as 'an individual' and he appealed for his name not to be made public. 'The nature and graphic content of the material sent are extremely serious.' The committee found allegations about 'communications of a sexually explicit nature' were proven. They also took into account a 2003 conviction for driving with more than three times the permitted amount of alcohol. Mr Harding had been banned from the road for three years and told to carry out 100 hours' unpaid work. He had maintained this was not relevant to the Anthony Stubbs case. The ban means that Mr Harding cannot teach in Wales. Ms Williams said: 'He may not apply for permission to re-register. He has a right of appeal within 28 days.' Mr Harding, who lived at Llanberis, had denied in the magistrates' court last year that he sent grossly offensive or indecent, obscene messages, one allegedly about having sex in school uniform. In July 2013 a district judge was about to adjudicate in the case against Mr Harding but it was dropped at the last minute after the principal legal officer to the Director of Public Prosecutions advised that it should not proceed. Antony hanged himself at Brickfield Wood in Leyland, in Lancashire, and his body was found three months later . Mr Harding and Anthony had encountered each other on dating website Love Leap, Caernarfon Magistrates' Court had heard. Although users must be 18 to register, Anthony was able to set up an account under the tag 'young, sexy gay'. Julie Hughes, prosecuting, said Anthony went missing on November 24 in 2012 following an argument with his girlfriend, Ms Mason, who had discovered the messages. Mr Harding denied sending grossly offensive or decent, obscene messages at Caernarfon Magistrates' Court . She told Caernarfon Magistrates' Court in north Wales. 'The messages themselves are obscene and indecent and, to an extent, that is conceded by the defendant in interview.' Detective Sergeant Richard Horton, of Lancashire police, said that although Anthony's body was not found until January 14 he had killed himself in woods near his Leyland home soon after he vanished. His mobile phone showed he had contacted 14 people through Love Leap, including a 47-year-old Manchester man. He also spoke to 12 others via the internet video telephone service Skype. The court was told he had asked Anthony about the size of his manhood, described him as a 'horny lad' and offered sex. Anthony Stubbs hanged himself after girlfriend Charlotte Mason, pictured left, found the 'obscene messages' He also sent indecent images of himself to the teenager along with an explicit video of two men performing a sex act. Users on Love Leap dating website, where Mr Harding and Anthony first met, must be 18 to register. Anthony, however, was able to set up an account under the tag 'young, sexy gay'. Tudur Owen, defending, said the case raised 'issues of public concern' because the Crown was alleging that the sending of salacious texts between two individuals amounted to a criminal act. Mr Owen said: 'It's a tragic case [but] there were no fixed plans for the men to meet. A lot of it is effectively fantasy.' Mr Harding, who was suspended by his school, accepted he sent images and a video to Anthony who, he said, had claimed to be 18. But he had denied sending grossly offensive or indecent, obscene messages between October 7 and 19 in 2012. Anthony had discovered he was going to be a father when he was 15, and had just celebrated his 16th birthday when Lily, his daughter was born last September.

"A Pennsylvania state legislator exchanged gunfire with a teenager that tried to rob him and a fellow lawmaker late Tuesday night, police said. Democrats Marty Flynn of Lackawanna and Ryan Bizzarro of Erie were walking to their Harrisburg residence after a late dinner when two teenagers approached. One 'pointed a gun first at Flynn and then at Bizzarro and demanded their wallets,' according to a statement from the House Democratic Caucus, as the second shouted instructions to him. Packing: Pennsylvania State Representative Marty Flynn was walking back from the capitol when he was accosted by an armed robber and exchanged gunfire . Flynn, who is a former Lackawanna County corrections officer and has a concealed carry permit, drew his pistol and fired. The gunman also shot, but it is not known who fired first. No one was injured as the two groups ran off in different directions. The Philadelphia Inquirer reports that Harrisburg police caught up to the two would-be robbers blocks away, and rounded up two other alleged accomplices. The charges include attempted homicide, conspiracy, robbery, aggravated assault, reckless endangerment and carrying a firearm without a license. Police say the recovered the gun used in the holdup and the alleged muggers will be prosecuted as adults. Two are 15 and two are 17 years old. Flynn and Bizzarro returned to their shared residence close to the capitol and called 911. Flynn told police he had fired his weapon and turned over the gun, according to the caucus's statement. Pair: Flynn and State Representative Ryan Bizzarro were elected in 2012 and share a residence in Harrisburg when the House is in session . Bad neighborhood?: The gunman approached the pair close to the capitol building in Harrisburg, near their residence . 'We are used to fighting for the people in our districts every day,' Flynn said in the statement. 'We certainly are going to stand up for ourselves and not become victims.' Last week, a bill passed the Pennsylvania House to amend the state's gun control laws to allow groups like the National Rifle Association to sue cities with gun control laws stricter than state or federal law. Bloomberg reports this follows the defeat of an NRA-opposed state gun control amendment requiring owners to report gun thefts and losses, before being adopted by more than two dozen local legislatures. Flynn and Bizzarro voted yes on the recently passed bill according to state records, and it now heads to the state senate.","Representatives Marty Flynn (D-Lackawanna) and Ryan Bizzarro (D-Erie) were walking back to the residence they share when House is in session .

"A happy couple have tied the knot - despite the fact the husband is just two days younger than the bride’s father. Annie and Gary Reed met three years ago when Annie was 18 and Gary was 49, while when Annie was a barmaid in Gary’s pub. Despite their 31-year age gap the couple's relationship has gone from strength to strength. They have two children together - Teagan, two, and Kai, seven months and last month tied the knot in their hometown of Doncaster. Annie and Gary Reed met three years ago when Annie was a barmaid in Gary's pub and married this August (pictured cutting the cake left) The happy couple tied the knot - despite the fact that Gary is just two days younger than Annie's dad . Speaking of how members of her family felt about the union Annie said: 'My dad walked me down the aisle - he’s two days older than Gary. 'I . thought he would have issues with the two of us being together at first, but the . first time he met Gary he shook his hand and they’ve been fine ever . since. Stay-at-home mum Annie, 21, said: 'We didn’t tell anyone about our relationship for the first three months though because we wanted to make sure it was the real thing, and we were worried what people would say. 'But friends and family were really supportive, especially when they could see how happy we were.' Left: Annie and Gary with their two children Tegan, 2 (right) and Kai, seven months (left); Right: The couple, who have been together for three . When Annie and Gary first met when she started working in a pub where Gary was the landlord, they hit it off straight away . Annie adds: 'My ex was older than me too so no-one was really surprised that I’d gone . for an older man, they just didn’t expect him to be that much older. 'Gary got jokes from people saying ""you’ve done alright there"" and stuff like that, but no-one said anything offensive to our faces.' But Annie suspects not everyone was as open-minded about their relationship as they seemed. Although customers claimed to be happy for them, . business at the pub declined and Gary was forced to sell up. Annie said: 'A lot of people stopped coming in which was a real shame. 'We . don’t know for sure if it was because of our relationship- because . everyone was nice to our faces, but the timing matches up.' Gary wore a kilt to the ceremony and the couple released white doves as a sign of their love . They kept their relationship a secret for the first three months, before telling family and friends . When Annie and Gary first met, when she started working in a pub where Gary was the landlord, they hit it off straight away, but Annie was already in a relationship with someone 20 years older. She said: 'Things with him were always rocky and Gary was always there for me. 'One night my partner went too far and we broke up. I called Gary to tell him I’d have to leave the pub because I thought I was going to have to move back with my mum who lives in a different part of Doncaster. 'Instead, he invited me to stay for a while until I got myself sorted.' Annie says she hadn’t thought about Gary in that way before but when she moved in the pair grew closer. Annie and Gary Reed at home: Annie says friends and family were supportive but suspects customers at the pub were not so open-minded . 'Gary made me breakfast one morning and drove me to work and we kissed – it was clear then that we both felt the same way,' she said. 'After that, I just never left.' The pair did keep their age-gap love quiet to begin with Annie said: 'I wanted to make sure it was something worth telling people about first. The couple got engaged after they had been together six months and tied the knot this August in front of all their friends and family and could not be happier. 'I can talk to Gary about anything at all - that’s what attracted me to him. 'Of course, Gary and I do have some issues sometimes because he thinks he knows more because he’s done it before, but we don’t argue any more than a regular couple.'","Annie and Gary met three years ago when Annie was 18 .

"Beyonce this week hit headlines when it was revealed she owned a pair of bespoke trainers made of five different exotic animal skins including anaconda, stingray and crocodile. Fans and animal welfare groups slammed the singer as 'cruel' and 'spoilt'. Now her husband, U.S. rapper Jay-Z, has been dragged into the controversy as it is revealed he has a pair of trainers made for him out of elephant skin. The shoes, which were custom-made last year by high fashion brand Perfectly Made Kicks (PMK), the same brand behind Beyonce's trainers, use the elephant hide among nine other types of skin - almost all from exotic animals. Scroll down for video . The Brooklyn Zoo Jordan 1's PMK designed for Jay Z last year are made Alligator, Stingray, Boa, Calf, Python, Ostrich, Crocodile, Lizard, and, most shockingly elephant . The shoe label (bottom left) proudly displays the skins used, and the elephant image dominates the label . The Brooklyn Zoo Jordan 1 not only . has the five skins used in Beyonce’s Key Beys - stingray, anaconda, . ostrich, crocodile and calf - but adds to that morbid roll call with . alligator, boa, python, and lizard. And, of course, most shocking of all, elephant skin. The sneakers, which use the heavily . grained hide in the side panels, are a customised version of the Nike Air Jordan and cost $2,500 (around £1,664) a pair. Jay-Z, who has been photographed wearing the shoes on many occasions, is obviously very proud of his exotic acquisition. When he received them he posted a picture on his blog Life And . Times of one of the shoes on a podium in his house accompanied by the caption, 'Condos in my condo'. Jay-Z has been seen out and about wearing his Brooklyn Zoo sneakers many times, here with Beyonce at the Brooklyn Nets, Toronto Raptors game in November . Jay-Z posted this picture on his lifestyle blog 'Life and Times' with the comment, 'Condos in my Condo' when he first got the shoes last October . It must be stated that while the idea of trading elephant skin seems alien and shocking to many of us, the use of sanctioned elephant hide in the manufacture of leather goods is not illegal. Elephant skin is used in everything from . boots, belts and shoes to gun holders and pool cues, and many items can . be bought easily on eBay and elsewhere online. It is legal to buy and sell the hides under certain conditions laid out in the Convention Of International Treaty Of Endangered Species (CITES). Ingrid Newkirk, founder of animal rights charity PETA says: 'There can be no shame or sense of decency left in the world, that a few people, can show so much disrespect for life as to order up the slaughter of the largest, most revered of animals only to make them into a pair of shoes.’ Elephants fall under Appendix II of . the CITES convention, which means they are considered 'not necessarily . now threatened with extinction but may become so unless trade is closely . controlled'. The elephant leather market, mostly based in the U.S. and importing from Africa, trades freely over the internet. The ears and trunk, being a thinner and softer leather, are highly prized and often used for wallets. Eight square feet of elephant skin is . usually sold at around $400 (around £266), although regular deals often . mean it can be purchased online for less. Although one would be hard pressed to find . a seller of elephant in the UK, in other countries it is a highly . valued skin that traders say is incredibly durable and has a 'rich texture'. Roje Exotics American Leathers is just one of the multiple websites where elephant leather can be purchased . Roje Exotic American Leathers is just one of numerous companies that offers elephant skin to purchase online. The leather can be purchased in a variety of colours from honey through to vintage peat, as well as original grey. Roje explain on their website . that their elephant hide, which comes from African elephants, is obtained . only under the ‘strict requirements of the Convention of International . Treaty of Endangered Species (CITES) permit’ They . justify the use of the beautiful beast’s skin by saying: ‘The source of . all African elephant skins come from culls once the elephant heard . reaches destructive numbers to African tribes and nature. ‘It’s very similar to our deer season in the United States. An average 8 square foot piece of elephant leather can be brought for about $400, but there are often deals like these on the Roje Exotic American Leathers website . A variety of colours and finishes are available for elephant skin, as can be seen on the Roje Exotic American Leathers website . ‘Without culling, which outsiders often view as unethical, many African tribes would lose their homes and possibly be trampled to death. ‘Designers, manufactures, and leather enthusiasts should not feel emotional or have guilt for using this leather as we are not creating a demand rather using a by product. We deal with reputable international partners who abide by all regulations and we never sell poached hides.’ But the truth remains that many of us feel a strong emotional attachment to these majestic beasts. Elephants are not only a highly . endangered species, but fiercely intelligent, remaining in tight-knit . family groups throughout their life and many are repulsed by the use of elephant skin under any circumstances. Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, PETA’s Founder Ingrid Newkirk said: ‘There can be no shame or sense of decency left in the world that a few people, so out of touch with the wonder of nature, can show so much disrespect for life as to order up the slaughter of the smallest, most vulnerable and the largest, most revered of animals only to make them into a pair of shoes.’ When contacted over the issue, the CEO of PMK, Andre Scott, responded: 'No elephants were beaten, harmed, or killed in the development and crafting of the Brooklyn Zoo sneaker. 'All leather and exotic skins including elephant skin found in the 'Brooklyn Zoo' used by PMK are from a legal supplier in New York.' Jay-Z is regularly seen wearing fur (left) and . he and wife Beyonce wore matching black fur coats to President Obama's .

Sierra was reported missing by her . mother on March 16 after she failed to turn up to her bus stop or high school in Morgan Hill, . California. Her cellphone was found near the side of the road the next day and her Juicy brand black and pink purse with clothes folded neatly inside was found the day after that.

Reward: Marlene LaMar, right, the mother of missing teenager Sierra LaMar, left, appealed for her safe return  as the family offered a $10,000 reward for information that may help find her . 'As each day goes on it's agonising,' she said. 'I'm definitely suffering sleep deprivation but I need to focus on the belief that Sierra is going to come forward.' Police believe Sierra has been . kidnapped as she does not have a history of running away and no family . problems. Interviews with friends and a search . of her computer also yielded no information indicating she had fled. Her disappearance has sparked an outpouring of support from the local community and received nation-wide press coverage. Thousands of Bay Area residents have joined the search for the teen in Morgan Hill and the surrounding area. San Francisco 49ers quarterback Alex Smith has also joined the search. Speaking . at a press conference over Easter weekend, Mr LaMar, a computer . engineer at a . tech startup in Sunnyvale, expressed his gratitude at the overwhelming . support the family had received from local residents. 'Everyone's been . so generous,' he said. Yesterday the family launched the Help Us Find Sierra LaMar website, which describes Sierra as a 'confident teenager who stands up for not only herself but others as well'. Donations: Sierra's family has scraped the $10,000 reward money together through fundraising and donations, the teen's father Steve said . Website: The 15-year-old's father Steve, mother Marlene and sister Danielle have also set up a website dedicated to finding the cheerleader . It also hosts a gallery of pictures and allows friends . to post messages to Sierra. 'The world has seemed so out of . balance since you’ve been gone,' wrote Jenna Wondka. 'I’m missing you . more and more every day, you never leave my mind. You’re too young and . innocent for this to be happening. You’ve always been there for me and . I’ll always be here for you until you’re found and anytime after that.' The family is also accepting donations via the site. They have raised the $10,000 reward money through fundraising and donations, Mr LaMar said. 'We're hoping it might give someone the . motivation to come forward,' he said. 'We're desperate for anything that . can bring her home to us.' Poignant: Posters have been taped up near to where Sierra went missing, as her family hope for more clues . Search: Thousands of Bay Area residents have joined the search for the teen in Morgan Hill and the surrounding area . Potential clue: The handcuff box and condoms were found, near the teenager's home, pictured, and close to where her phone and handbag were found abandoned as shown on the map . So far the search has turned up an . empty 'handcuff' box and two used condoms, found by a search volunteer . within 1.5miles of where the pretty teen's phone and purse were found, days after she disappeared. Investigators told Mercury News that the find could be a major breakthrough in the disappearance which has stumped police, or it could be a simple coincidence. Authorities . have investigated more than 1,200 tip and clocked around 7,500 hours on . the case. They said they would be broadening the search this week. 'The sheriff’s office will be . sending out deputies on motor dirt bikes later this week to canvass . remote/rural areas in south Santa Clara County areas,' Sgt Jose .

School: In April sheriffs investigators visited Miss Lamar's school of Sobrato High, suspending their ground search for interviews with her classmates and friends . Without a trace: While police dogs lost her scent at her mother's driveway Sierra's cell phone was recovered in a field nearby the day after her disappearance . Growing concern: Sierra's purse containing neatly folded clothes was also found two days after her disappearance . If Sierra has been killed, her body is likely to be above ground, Sgt Cardoza said.

"A shopper was shocked when he weighed a £1 bag of Asda bananas on a self-scan checkout - and found they only cost 54p. Alan Hudson, 52, was shopping at his local Asda supermarket in Boldon, Tyne and Wear, when he decided to see how much his £1 bag of bananas would cost if they were loose. Since posting the video on Facebook last week, the clip has attracted an astonishing two million views and been shared more than 30,000 times. Scroll down for video . Alan Hudson, 52, was shocked when he weighed a £1 bag of Asda bananas and found they only cost 54p . Mr Hudson, a train driver, said: 'It's disgusting really. 'There are millions of people living on the poverty line, trying to reduce the cost of their shopping as much as possible and looking out for bargains. 'That bag had a bright red sticker on it, saying they were a pound. 'It makes it look like a bargain, when in fact you're getting ripped off by nearly half. 'I'm definitely going to be reconsidering my shopping habits, and I hope others do too. 'I do like bananas, but I'm going to think twice about where I buy them from.' Since posting the video on Facebook last week, the clip has attracted an astonishing two million views and been shared more than 30,000 times . The MySupermarket website shows that vegetables and fruit bought from Asda tends to be cheaper when bought individually rather than in a packet. Pink lady apples x 4 - £2 (50p each) Pink lady apple single - 47.5p . Bag of oranges x 5 - £2 (40p each) Orange loose - 25p . Kiwi fruit x4 - £1.65 (41.3p each) Kiwi fruit loose - 24p . Lemons x 5 - £1.50 (30p each) Lemon loose - 25p . Red onions x 4 - £1 (25p each) Red onion loose - 9.8p . On Asda's website, the £1 bag of five bananas are advertised as costing only 20p each, while loose bananas, under their 'Pricelock' guarantee, are set at 68p per kilo. If somebody were to take a banana to work every day for a year, buying the bags of them would cost £52 annually, while buying five loose fruits a week would come to around £28, depending on their weight. Elsewhere, other pre-bagged fruit and vegetables, such as potatoes, apples, tomatoes and pears, were either always cheaper or the same price. An Asda in Filton, Bristol, saw a £1 bag of onions weigh in at 69p. However, it was a Tesco in Eastville, in Bristol which saw the biggest price difference, with a £1 bag of onions weighing in at just 30p and a £1 bag of bananas weighing 59p. But today Asda defended its pre-packaged bananas, justifying the extra cost because they are 'perfect to eat'. A spokesman for the supermarket chain said: 'The majority of bananas we sell are loose which require a little bit of ripening at home and are price locked at 68p per kilo. 'Our pre-packed bananas are stored for a little longer and have already been ripened so they're perfect to eat as soon as you've bought them, they are then pre packed by hand, which is why they're slightly more expensive. A pack of Tesco Onions which are priced at 79p, but if they are weighed they would cost 58p, a 21p difference . 'We clearly label the prices in store, so customers can choose which product is best for them.' Joanna Blythman, author of Shopped: the shocking power of British supermarkets, told MailOnline: 'I am not the least bit surprised by this news. This sort of thing happens all the time. 'Supermarkets are very good at creating an illusion that they give people good value for food, but they give with one hand and take with the other. 'They give you the idea that you are getting a bargain when often it is the opposite. But we trust them not to lie to us. 'They use price and promotion to confuse consumers and you only tend to notice if you are vigilant.' She added: 'You should never believe any supermarket promotion. If you think you are getting a good deal, you should act with suspicion and cynicism.' Charlotte Burns, who writes the MoneySavingExpert’s Deals Hunter blog, told MailOnline: ‘Supermarkets often have deals on their pre-packaged fruit and veg to lure shoppers into thinking they’re getting a great price. 'But what many people don’t know is that buying pre-packaged fruit and veg can cost you nearly twice as much as buying the same fruit and veg individually. 'I recently tested this at Morrisons. It sells £1 bags, with five bananas in each bag. I weighed up a bag to see how much the bananas would have cost if I had bought five individually – it was 55p.' 'When you can, try to buy loose items or products from behind the counter. But keep an eye out for discounts on pre-packed alternatives.'","Alan Hudson, 52, weighed a £1 bag of Asda bananas and found they cost 54p .

"Two orphaned baby elephants have become best friends after being rescued by a wildlife trust. Ashaka and Kamok were discovered in the wild separately after being abandoned by their mothers a year ago. The African elephants - both named after parts of Kenya - were taken in by the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust on the outskirts of Nairobi, and have since become inseparable. Now, the boisterous duo spend their days rolling around in mud, chasing warthogs and bashing bushes. Scroll down for video . Ashaka (left) and Kamok (right) were rescued by rangers and taken to the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust in Nairobi National Park in Kenya a year ago . The animals have developed a close friendship after being integrated into the herd of orphaned elephants also rescued in the wild by rangers . Kamok was just one day old when she was abandoned by her mother and herd. Her limbs were weak and she was unable to walk properly. She wandered alone and scared into a camp in the Ol Pejeta conservancy, where rangers began bottle feeding her. Two months later, three-week old Ashaka was found at the bottom of a deep waterhole after waking rangers at the Kenyan Wildlife Service in Tsavo East with her distressed screams. Once rescued, both animals were flown to the Trust’s nursery in Nairobi National Park and are now part of its foster programme. Rob Brandford, UK director of the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, said: ‘The bonds between elephants are extremely close and important. 'For the orphans we rescue, the other elephants become their lost herd and family,with many choosing their own best friends. The elephants are endangered in Nairobi among other parts of Africa with illegal poaching and threats to their natural habitat bringing the species ever closer to extinction . When orphaned animals are taken in by rangers or conservationists they form fast attachments with other creatures after losing their herds . The baby elephant roll around in the mud to cool down as visitors at the Nairobi National Park watch on. Ashaka and Kamok are part of the Trust's fostering programme . One of the young animals gets a mud bath from a ranger who uses a heavy shovel to coat their dried skin with damp, wet mud as temperatures soar . Two of the elephants struggle to get back on their feet after enjoying a splash around in the pool of red mud with the rest of the orphaned animals . Rangers use a special formula of milk to feed the elephants when they are babies. Eventually they will be released back into the wild to integrate with herds . 'These bonds will last a lifetime. ‘Kamok and Ashaka were rescued within months of one another and as both are girls in the original infant group, they have settled into nursery life in the knowledge that in each other they have a playmate and friend.’ The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust cares for endangered elephants and black rhinos. It is also caring for a baby giraffe called Zili. Founded in 1977 by Dame Daphne Sheldrick D.B.E in memory of her late husband, it focuses on the rescue and rehabilitation of orphaned elephants. The Trust has cared for more than 150 elephants in almost 40 years, reintegrating animals back into the wild when they are ready.","Ashaka and Kamok were discovered separately in Nairobi wild after being abandoned by their herds .

"Cindy and Rob Harris have undergone a year of IVF to carefully select their next child – the baby that will save their son’s life. Gold Coast toddler, 22-month-old Ryven, was born with the extremely rare genetic condition Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS), which deteriorates his quality of life and could be fatal. The average life expectancy of a male with WAS is 15 to 20 years. Scroll down for video . An excited Ryven announces the news of the new sibling that will come into the world in March 2015 - who will not only add to their family but answer his family's prayers. The new baby boy will be the genetic donor match Ryven desperately needs . Cindy and Rob Harris are excited to welcome their second child, a son, in March 2015, who will be the genetic match for their son Ryven. Their new son will hopefully save Ryven's life . Ryven was born with the extremely rare genetic condition Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome and diagnosed at 12 weeks. His parents feared he would never leave the hospital . Ryven, who will turn two on December 28, has not had an easy start to life but is a happy boy with a beautiful smile, who with the love and support of his parents will hopefully be able to go to school and lead a positive and normal life . Ryven is quite literally one in a million, with only one to ten cases of WAS per million males worldwide. His only hope for a cure is a bone marrow transplant, except the toddler has a very rare blood type and can not find a match, despite being on a registry of 15 million people. When Cindy and Rob couldn’t find a solution, they turned to IVF and the wonders of modern medicine to make the perfect match their son needs to stay alive. They decided to have a baby to save their son. It was difficult, expensive and ‘an emotional rollercoaster’ but the Harris family knew they would do anything to help their little boy. Ryven's parents campaigned for blood donation, when their son urgently needed a platelet transfusion but the Australian Red Cross blood bank were nearly completely out of Ryven's blood type . In 24 hours, more than 5000 people responsed to the call for action - to join 'Team Ryven' After four rounds of IVF, the couple are thrilled to be expecting another little boy who will have a special and unique bond with his brother, knowing that they were picked for each other. ‘It’s a gamble, we know that and it’s one we’re willing to take because we’ll get to save our little boy and we get another beautiful baby,’ Ms Harris told The Today Show. ‘We’re fortunate because we get to put Ryven through a transplant with a 12 out of 12 perfect match, which is extremely hard to find.’ When the baby is born, the cord blood will be saved for Ryven. Ryven needs to be very careful, but by all accounts is a joyful little boy with a love of life. Ryven’s body struggles to make platelets, which means his blood is not able to clot properly.Even the slightest bump can cause serious bruising and hematomas . Later, when Ryven needs a bone marrow transplant, he will have ‘a 12 out of 12 match’, which is the best possible outcome. To conceive a baby with the same blood type as Ryven, doctors needed to find an embryo with an identical tissue match. ‘The scientists are amazing because the gene that I carry is not going to be passed onto the new baby,’ Ms Harris told The Today Show. ‘He’s going to be a healthy boy with, touchwood, no complications.’ Ryven’s body struggles to make platelets, which means his blood is not able to clot properly. Even the slightest bump can cause serious bruising and hematomas. With Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), Ryven is at risk of excessive bleeding or haemorrhaging. Ryven also has a weak immune system, which prevents him from being as social as most children. ‘At the moment he’s very isolated and he can’t go to day care,’ said Mr Harris. ‘Our dream is for him to go to school one day and have some friends.’ Although he is a vibrant little boy, Ryven was given an incredibly difficult start to life, with his parents unsure if he would ever leave the hospital. Ryven also has a weak immune system, which prevents him from being as social as most children . His struggles with WAS were made even more life-threatening by his incredibly rare blood type. A year ago, Ryven was fighting for his life in hospital when the Australian Red Cross blood bank almost ran out of his specific blood type, O-negative CMB-negative. His parents made a plea on The Today Show for the public to donate blood, platelets and join the bone marrow registry – particularly those with the same blood type as Ryven. Within 24 hours, the Red Cross had received more than 5000 calls and 2000 online enquiries about donation. It was the busiest day in the call centre since the Black Saturday fires. Thanks to the campaign for Ryven, for the first time ever, O negative blood supplies are at an adequate level. Ryven also has a weak immune system, which prevents him from being as social as most children . Thanks to the Ryven's campaign, for the first time ever, O negative blood supplies are at an adequate level . The couple, with the help of friends and family, have started the Ryven Foundation to support Wiskott-Aldrich Patients . They are campaigning to raise awareness and funds, so people understand how the choice to donate blood can be the difference between life and death. ‘To donate blood marrow isn’t actually scarry. It’s a couple of injections, a blood transfusion through a tube and that’s it,’ Ms Harris told The Today Show. ‘If we can get the message out there that that’s what it is and that will save a life, I think a lot more people will get on the registry.’ They are thrilled about the imminent arrival of their second child, who will have a unique and special bond with his brother Ryven – after all, they were picked especially for each other. They can’t wait to welcome their child into the world, who they say ‘will be a hero for life'. Ryven's parents have campaigned solidly to help their son, other Wiskott-Aldritch Syndrome sufferers and to raise awareness about the importance of blood donation and signing up to be a bone marrow donor . They have organised many activities, campaigns and events to raise awareness and funds, all with the colour red - 'red for Ryven' They can’t wait to welcome their child into the world, who they say ‘will be a hero for life'","Toddler Ryven Harris was born with an extremely rare genetic condition .

"Man of the moment Matthew McConaughey has taken up an unlikely cause - supporting Washington Redskins team owner Dan Snyder in his quest to keep the team's name which many Native American groups consider offensive. Despite being born and raised in Texas, the Academy Award-winning actor has been a Redskins fan since the age four, when he rooted for the Indians in Western movies and associated then-quarterback Chris Hanburger with his favorite food - hamburgers. 'I love the emblem. I dig it. It gives me a little fire and some oomph,' McConaughey said in an interview with GQ. Scroll down for video . Famous fan: Actor Matthew McConaughey has come out to support the Washington Redskins keeping their team name, which many Native Americans group say is offensive. Pictured above at a Redskins practice last June, with team owner Dan Snyder (red-striped shirt) who has vowed never to change the team name . Civil rights groups have been fighting for years to get the team's name changed, and that cause gained some traction recently when the U.S. Patent Office cancelled the Redskins  trademark  in June for being 'disparaging to Native Americans'. However, team-owner Snyder has personally vowed never to change the name on the basis that it 'honors' the American Indian legacy, and is currently engaged in a legal battle to keep the moniker. 'I know a lot of Native Americans don't have a problem with it, but they're not going to say, ""No, we really want the name."" That's not how they're going to use their pulpit,' McConaughey said. Not offended: In an interview with GQ, the Academy Award-winning actor says he knows native Americans who do not have a problem with the name. One Native American held up a sign saying as much as a game against the Arizona Cardinals earlier this month (left). On the right, a picture of the team's American Indian emblem . Critics: Native American indians protest the Washington Redskins name prior to the game against the Arizona Cardinals at University of Phoenix Stadium on October 12 . Magazine man: McConaughey is the cover man for this month's GQ magazine . 'It's like my feeling about gun control: ""I get it. You have the right to have guns. But look, let's forget that right. Let's forget the pleasure you get safely on your range, because it's in the wrong hands in other places,""' he added. 'What interests me is how quickly it got pushed into the social consciousness. We were all fine with it since the 1930s, and all of a sudden we go, ""No, gotta change it""? It seems like when the first levee breaks, everybody gets on board. However, McConaughey says he won't be hurt if Snyder is eventually forced to change the team name. 'Now that it's in the court of public opinion, it's going to change. I wish it wouldn't, but it will,' the actor said. This isn't the first time McConaughey has come out in support of the Redskins. Last June, the actor swung by practice while in the D.C. area for a charity event, where he was pictured chatting up quarterback Robert Griffin III  and watching drills from the sidelines with Snyder. McConaughey is in the middle of a career-resurgence, and this year won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in Dallas Buyers Club, as well as Emmy nomination for acting on TV show True Detective. He is will next star in space-drama Interstellar, which is slated to be released next month. On the sidelines: When he attended Redskins practice last June, McConaughey chatted up quarterback Robert Griffin III.

"Adrian Peterson has six children by six different mothers, he was the subject of a lengthy police investigation for sexual battery after a booze-fueled sex party that he invited his underage brother to, and his charity has claimed it gave out tens of thousands of dollars to nonprofit organizations that say they never saw a dime, according to a shocking new report. After a lengthy police investigation, Peterson was never charged. The star has also never been accused of wrongdoing with respect to his charity. Before his arrest for child abuse, the Minnesota Vikings running back was one of the NFL's most bankable stars. He combined a record-setting talent on the field with a 'good guy' image off the field and racked up millions of dollars in sponsorships from the likes of General Mills and Nike. But now, a shocking report by the Minneapolis Star-Tribune claims that his behavior wasn't nearly as squeaky clean has he let on. Peterson was arrested on September 12 on felony child abuse charges in his Texas hometown after he allegedly whipped his four-year-old son so badly that he left wounds on the boy's legs, buttocks and genitals. Scroll down for video . Family man: Adrian Peterson, seen here with wife Ashley Peterson, has fathered six children with six different women - who live in three different states, according to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune . These are the wounds that police say Adrian Peterson left on his four-year-old son. He was later charged with felony reckless or negligent injury to a child . The Vikings, after sponsors began to pull out, agreed to drop Peterson from the team until the case is wrapped up in the courts. Peterson is on a six-year, $86million contract and was by far the biggest star on the team. Peterson has admitted to hitting the child but said he  was only giving out the same punishment he received himself. Before September, 29-year-old Peterson had several run-ins with police, including a 2011 incident at a luxury hotel in which he was accused of rape after a night of drinking of drinking, partying and sex that involved four women, according to the Star-Tribune. According to a police report viewed by the newspaper, Peterson brought his teenage brother and another family member, Chris Brown, along for the party. Brown said he paid for the hotel room with a credit card from Peterson's All Day Inc. charity. At one point in the evening, according to police, one of the four women walked in on Peterson having sex with another woman and started fighting with him, telling Peterson that she was 'emotionally attached' to him. Peterson responded by telling her that he's engaged to someone else and expecting a baby. After one of the women accused Peterson of sexual assault, police launched a months-long investigation that resulted in a 39-page report. Ultimately, prosecutors decided that no crime had been committed, according to the Star-Tribune. Peterson's lawyer has previously said that the NFL star did nothing wrong. Bankable: The Minnesota Vikings have invested heavily in Peterson's image. He was the only player invited to a groundbreaking ceremony for the team's new stadium. He is seen here with owner Zygi Wilf . Peterson projected a strong family image before his arrest. His father is a convicted felony who was in prison by the time he went to college on a football scholarship, but he has repeatedly talk about his relationship with his mother Bonita Brown. However, he's been quiet about the other part of his family life - his children, refusing even to say publicly how many he has. The Star-Tribune reports that Peterson had six children with six different women who live in three states - Minnesota, Georgia and Texas. In October 2013, his two-year-old son died in South Dakota after being beaten to death by the mother's boyfriend. Peterson had cultivated a public image with his All Day Inc. charity that aims to help at-risk children. Last year, he took a load of children to Dick's Sporting Goods and spent more than $100 each to buy them clothes and sports equipment. However, the Star-Tribune reports that Peterson's charity has made questionable donations in recent years. In 2011, records show that the charity had $247,000 in revenue but sent out money to just three charities. The charity reported to the IRS that it gave $70,000 to a Maryland nonprofit - though the director of that group said it had never gotten a cent from Peterson's group, according to the newspaper. At a second charity, the North Texas Food Bank, the director said she had never even heard of Peterson - much less receiving money from him. This, however, appears to be a bookkeeping error because the East Texas Food Bank said it had gotten donations from the NFL star.","Adrian Peterson allegedly took his underage brother and another male relatively along for a sex-romp with four women at a Minnesota hotel in 2011 .

"Trekking trip: Mother-of-two Debra Wilding, 49, was with a team of 12 hikers from the UK . The grieving husband of a British woman who died after falling ill during a trekking trip to Everest praised her last night as a ‘lovely’ person who was ‘doing what she wanted to do’. Mother-of-two Debra Wilding was with a team of 12 hikers from the UK - including her daughter - when she began to feel unwell after a trip to the Everest base camp. The 49-year-old started to have trouble breathing and spent the night at a hotel in Khumjung with her daughter, Hannah, 23, while en route to the Nepalese capital Kathmandu. But Mrs Wilding, from Ulverston, Cumbria, who was married to finance director Ian, was found dead in the hotel on Monday. Mr Wilding said: ‘For the family this is the most difficult thing we have ever had to go through. We are finding it hard but are being very supportive of each other.’ The 52-year-old added: ‘She was the oldest person in the group and a very determined lady. I know when she's suffering she just ploughs on through - she grits her teeth and fights on. ‘Deb had done lots of training on the fells here in Cumbria - walking, running and cycling, so her fitness level was generally very good. ‘But the starting point of this trek was over three times as high as the highest mountain in Cumbria, and from there went up by another 2,000 metres (6,500ft) to get to Everest Base Camp. Fell ill: Mrs Wilding (left) started to have trouble breathing and spent the night at a hotel in Khumjung with her daughter Hannah (right), 23, while en route to the Nepalese capital Kathmandu . ‘She was doing what she wanted to do. It had been a dream for a long time and she'd been planning it for a year and had done all the right preparation. It's just so sad it has ended the way that it has.’ Mrs Wilding’s body has been airlifted to Kathmandu’s Teaching Hospital for a post-mortem examination, with officials saying she may have suffered from altitude sickness. Local police official Purushottam Silwal said: 'She possibly died of altitude sickness. Her body was airlifted to Kathmandu for a post mortem.' The Everest base camp where she fell ill is 17,700ft (5,364 metres) above sea level. The couple, who also have a 14-year-old daughter, moved to their £500,000 four-bedroom house in Cumbria five years ago having visiting the Lake District regularly for a number of years. Location: The woman was on a trekking trip to Everest base camp (pictured) with a team of 12 British hikers, when she began to fell unwell . Mr Wilding said: ‘It's been a terrible shock. When you are about 50 you think you've got many more years together and living in such a beautiful part of the world where there is so much to enjoy. ‘We were looking forward to 20 or 30 years of walking the hills and enjoying the Lakes. You don't expect it to stop so abruptly and with no warning. ‘There's really nothing that can comfort you after the shock of losing such a lovely person, so popular and with so many good friends.’ Altitude sickness is caused when people ascend too quickly into areas where there is decreased atmospheric pressure. Symptoms include headaches, fatigue, dizziness and nausea. People with more severe forms can suffer from breathlessness, even when resting, and are advised to seek immediate medical attention because it can be fatal. Everest: A Foreign Office spokesman said they were aware of the death of a British national in Nepal and say they are providing consular assistance . The woman's body was airlifted to the Kathmandu Teaching Hospital (pictured) in the Nepalese capital, for a post mortem . A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We are aware of the death of a British national in Nepal on October 6, 2014. We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.' October is peak trekking season in the Himalayas and Nepal is home to eight of the world’s 14 highest mountains. Earlier this year, hundreds of climbers abandoned plans to ascend Mount Everest after 16 Nepalese guides were killed in an avalanche in April. The Sherpa people are one of the main ethnic groups in Nepal's alpine region, and many make their living as climbing guides on Everest and other Himalayan peaks. More than 4,000 climbers have reached the summit of Everest since 1953, when it was first conquered by New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay. Hundreds have also died trying.","Debra Wilding, 49, had returned from Everest base camp when she fell ill .

"Scientists have made an exciting breakthrough in the treatment of bowel cancer - using existing drugs. Dr Toby Phesse, of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne, said early data showed medication currently used to treat psoriasis, arthritis and myelofibrosis could help in the fight against the country's second deadliest form of cancer. 'About 17,000 people are diagnosed with bowel cancer every year and about 4,000 people die, so we are really crying out for new ways to tackle this disease,' Dr Phesse told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Dr Michael Buchert ( left), Dr Toby Phesse (centre) and Associate Professor Matthias Ernst (right) from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne have discovered an existing drug that could stop tumour growth in bowel cancer . He said the lab's focus was directed at identifying which signalling pathways were used by tumours to grow and trying to target those pathways to prevent tumour growth. 'We have known for many years that Wnt signaling is mutated in around 80 per cent of colon tumours. 'However, this pathway is also very important for the health of the normal cells in the intestine, and therefore targeting the Wnt pathway directly poses considerable challenges as you risk effecting the normal cells of the intestine and therefore inducing severe side effects. 'We had to come up with a new method and target a parallel pathway.' This is what brought scientists to the existing medicines, JAK inhibitors. 17,000 people are diagnosed with bowel cancer every year and about 4,000 people die . The scientists' breakthrough came when they found that 80 per cent of colon tumours responded to treatment with a JAK inhibitor. The treatment has caused excitement because the drug only targeted cancer cells, leaving normal cells unharmed, leaving no side effects. 'In the pre-clinic models we looked at the normal cells of the intestine and we found that all the cells could grow and function normally. 'None of the mice used in the models lost any weight, suggesting they were healthy and could tolerate the drug very well.' The scientists found that JAKs not only stop cell growth but also prevent the development of new tumours. Dr Phesse said this is an exciting breakthrough that has great potential to help thousands of people who have colon cancer or face risk of developing tumours. 'The main point is that the inhibitors already exist and have been approved,' he said. 'This means it is going to speed up the clinical trials process'. Dr Michael Buchert, another scientist from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research said since the medicines are already being used for other cures scientists know it is safe for humans. 'We hope that this will enable our research to rapidly reach clinical trials for bowel cancer patients and deliver benefits in the near future.' The scientists found that JAKs not only stops cell growth but also prevents the development of new tumours .","Australian scientists have found  existing medicines can stop tumour development and growth .

"Fred the sulphur-crested cockatoo has celebrated his 100th birthday at Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary outside Hobart . A sulphur-crested cockatoo has apparently made it to his 100th year, surpassing most birds of his kind by 60 years. Keeping to tradition, Fred - the flying-centenarian, was sent a letter from The Queen at Buckingham Palace to mark his special milestone. The talking-bird was also thrown a huge birthday-bash by his carers at the Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary outside Hobart on Sunday. Greg Irons, Director of Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary told Daily Mail Australia that Fred could in fact be even older than 100. 'We aren't 100 per cent sure but we think that he is well past,' he said. 'He was 95-years-old when I started working, which was 10 years ago - we just waited a bit longer to make sure he is past 100'. If Fred's age is in fact correct, the senior bird would have been born around World War 1 in 1915, flying his way through a hundred years of  memories. 'He is in really good nick and even though he isn't as active as the younger ones he is still remarkable for the way he carries on. 'He doesn't do a lot of flying, still dances, sings and talks a lot. 'He behaves like a two-year-old,' Mr Irons said. Other than a few sprains, Fred has had no health issues and has not visited a vet in 10 years. 'He is a resilient little character - we all love him here.' Mr Irons said Fred came to the Sanctuary 20-years ago through a woman's will. 'He [Fred] was originally owned for decades by a lady who passed away,' he said. 'Fred was then looked after by her family who had to move. 'The lady actually requested in her will to give Fred to us, so they gave him to us.' The talking-bird was thrown a huge birthday-bash by his carers at the Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary outside Hobart on Sunday . Members of the public and the Wild Child Kids Club took part in Fred's birthday celebration, dressing up in cockatoo suits and helmets while they enjoyed face painting and a sausage sizzle . Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary receives many birds from owners who can no longer care for them. But unlike Fred, most of them do not make it to 100. For cockatoos living in captivity like Fred, 70 is considered extraordinarily old. Sulphur-crested cockatoos in the wild live to about 40-years-old. Similarly to human's noses, bird's beaks grow with age. Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary manager, Petra Harris, gave Fred his special birthday cake. Fred apparently has a HUGE crush on her - it made his day . 'Because his beak keeps growing as he gets older we have had to monitor it by making sure we feed him food that helps to slow it down,' Mr Irons said. But for Fred's birthday, Sanctuary workers allowed the birthday-boy to indulge. 'We got him a special cake which was all made of natural ingredients - honey based bird seeds and nuts - he enjoyed it so much.' Members of the public and the Wild Child Kids Club took part in Fred's birthday celebration, dressing up in cockatoo suits and helmets while they enjoyed face painting and a sausage sizzle. 'Fred doesn't think he is a bird, he thinks he is a person, so when he has all that human attention he loves it. 'It was so touching to see everyone here,' Mr Irons said. 'It says a lot about animals in general.' But Fred doesn't warm to everyone - he has a preference. Even at the age of 100, Fred still goes weak at the knees for women. 'He is one for the ladies - he doesn't like males. He is a man-hater.' Fred, who is 'full-of-life and constantly interacting with humans', is an icon for all animals, according to Mr Irons. 'It says a lot about Fred who is able to develop such a great interaction with kids - he represents all animals. 'If it helps a child to have a moment with an animal like Fred, well that goes a long way - teaching them how to respect animals.' Mr Irons said he has seen a few cockatoos reach 120-years-old but none quite like Fred. 'He is a special boy to all of us - he brings a lot of life. 'I would love to think he would be around for another 10 or 20 years.' Keeping to tradition, Fred - the flying-centenarian, was sent a letter from The Queen at Buckingham Palace to mark the bird's milestone .

"It may have a face that only a mother could love, but it's still one of a kind at Queensland's Australia Zoo. The zoo's latest arrival - a baby echidna that's the first to be born under a breeding program that began just two years ago - is getting plenty of attention. This may come as a surprise because when it comes to cute, a big nose, beady eyes and bald spots don't typically feature on the list of desirable features. The smallest attraction at Queensland's Australia Zoo - a baby puggle weighing only 696 grams . But when you're a puggle, it works wonders. The zoo released some oh-so-cute photographs of its latest arrival, which at three months old weighs just 696 grams, and doesn't have a name yet as it's still too early to work out if it is a he or a she. Zoo keepers are happy with the puggle's progress. It's gaining weight, growing new hair and spines every day, and nursing happily from mum Tippy. A 'puggle' is the term used for the young of an echidna until it leaves the pouch. The baby echidna was the first to be born under a breeding program that began just two years ago at the zoo . Despite its small beginnings an adult echidna will eventually grow to this size . The little puggle does not have a name yet as it's still too early to work out if it is a he or a she . Mothers give birth to an egg that incubates in her pouch, and the puggle hatches after 10 days. Staying in the pouch for 45 to 60 days . After that, puggles start to develop spines prompting mothers in the wild to leave them in a nursery burrow, with the mother coming back once or twice a week to feed it. Echidnas are one of two types of monotreme, or egg-laying mammals, found in the world.

She told Radar: 'I believe she is seeing him and hanging around him. I'm hurt.' McDaniel was released from prison in Georgia earlier this year after serving 10 years behind bars for aggravated child molestation. Anna said she was the victim in that case, USA Today reported. June's alleged relationship with the convicted sex offender has led to the cancellation of popular TLC reality show Here Comes Honey Boo Boo. Speaking out: June posted a video on Friday confirming the cancellation of Here Comes Honey Boo Boo . It's over: Here Comes Honey Boo Boo was cancelled by TMZ on Friday . After Mama June and McDaniel's relationship emerged, TMZ revealed June's husband Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson had been aware of the relationship but chose to ignore it. June kept 'a box of photos' of McDaniel in the house - but even when Sugar Bear told her to get rid of them, she wouldn't, TMZ reported. The report added that she began seeing McDaniel again after he was released from prison in March.

It had previously been reported that it was Sugar Bear who had been cheating on June using on-line dating sites, but now TMZ claims it was actually June who was having an affair, and used the story about Sugar Bear's infidelity to end her relationship with him. The revelation comes after a report in People hints that June now faces losing her children to child services. Susan Boatwright of Georgia's Division of Family and Child Services told People: 'From our point of view, when there are young children who are not able to protect themselves that are in daily contact or living with a sex offender, someone would go out and assess the situation and decide whether the children can stay there or not.' She added: 'If we thought a child was in harm's way in any way, shape or form, we would develop a safety plan and make sure the children are not around an offender.' Despite the startling revelations about McDaniel's past, his daughter-in-law Peaches McDaniel has defended him on Facebook, insisting he's a good father.

Rosie was allegedly held prisoner . almost her entire life along with a 57-year-old Irish woman and a . 69-year-old Malaysian woman until they were rescued from a flat in . Brixton, South London, last month, . The . couple accused of keeping the women prisoner – an Indian man and his . Tanzanian wife, both 67 – were said last night to be leaders of a . radical Marxist group based in Brixton which collapsed in the 1970s and . met the older victims through a ‘shared political ideology’. The . male suspect was known to police having being arrested in the 1970s, . prompting questions about whether police missed opportunities to rescue . the brainwashed women, who were regularly beaten. Last . night officers were searching 13 addresses around London, as it was . revealed that the couple moved frequently to avoid detection. Letters sent to Marius Feneck from Rosie - one of the three women held captive in Brixton . Rachel Price 25 and her boyfriend Marius Feneck 26. The victim sent letters and 220 poems to Marius, a neighbour she fixated on, telling him how she was locked up by 'evil and racist' monsters . Guard: Police stand in front of a property in Brixton, Borough of Lambeth, south London where three women were allegedly kept as slaves for at least 30 years . Probe: Plain-clothed police officers conduct door-to-door investigations at addresses close to the flat where the women were found . The . disclosures came as an astonishing series of heart-rending letters and . photographs of the youngest victim emerged, in which she told of her . despair at being held prisoner. Starved . of love, the victim sent letters and 220 poems to Marius Feneck, a . neighbour she fixated on, telling him how she was locked up by ‘evil and . racist’ monsters. She said: ‘I want you to know the truth. 'These monsters here are absolutely evil and racist. ‘I . begged them that horrible night not to tear us apart, but they said . they’d HARM YOU if I don’t promise to stay away from you... and then . they imprisoned me here, locking all the doors and windows. ‘I . daren’t try anything because I know they’ll do something evil to you if . I do... So I’m like a fly trapped in a spider’s web... ‘I . apologise to you from the bottom of my heart for the evil actions of . these crooks who dare to call themselves my “relatives”. I HATE them!’ She goes on: ‘I suffer unspeakable torment, yet every bit is worth it, to keep my beloved safe. ‘I . will surely die if anything happened to you. I would gladly stay in . this evil monsters’ dark dungeon for the rest of my life – hey I would . gladly give up my life (I call it life, but it’s not, it’s only . existence... your ever loyal dragon Rosie.’ She also posted dozens of photographs of herself to him, which reveal the cramped, sparsely furnished flat that was her home. In one shot, she is seen cradling a Father Christmas cuddly toy in a photograph she referred to ‘Redhead Rosie’ with her ‘baby’. Possessions: Boxes of crayons and other items sit on a window ledge at the south London . Neighbours said they often saw a young woman who lived at the property staring out of the window or accompanying an elderly couple to the shops . In . another she is sitting on a plastic chair, resting her aching feet . after hours of carrying out household chores. The first thing the youngest of the three women asked for after escaping the south London flat was make-up. The . 30-year-old was freed into the care of the Freedom Charity along with a . 57-year-old Irish woman and a 69-year-old Malaysian woman. Freedom . charity founder Aneeta Prem told the Sunday Times: 'It was the first . thing that she asked me for and one of the things she was very, very . keen on. 'She . liked the way I did my make-up. I don't know if she had ever worn . make-up. I ended up buying them all foundation, mascara, eye liners, . powders lipsticks. 'They were absolutely thrilled and excited when I took the box of make-up out.' She wrote: ‘I have to rest . my legs a lot, they hurt! My ankles swell up, and my toes start . cramping up.’ Mr Feneck, 26, a welding student said he received knitted gifts which were sprayed with strong perfume and birthday cards. ‘One . day I was speaking to Rosie and she told me she had come to Britain . after her parents died in a fire and the people she was living with had . adopted her but she didn’t say where she came from originally,’ he said. ‘She . began sending me photos of herself. They were signed darling love Red . Head Rosie or Writer Rosie. She said things like she loved me and we . were meant to be together.’ He . said the other women were frightened to tell him their names. ‘I spoke . to them once or twice a year when I was passing,’ he said. ‘They would . never volunteer names. If you asked they would change the subject.’ Mr . Feneck’s girlfriend, Rachael Price, 25, said she felt threatened when . the girl began sending her abusive letters after she moved in with him . Miss Price said: ‘I . felt quite disturbed, but I didn’t go to the police because I thought . she had problems so I would just leave it.’ Last . night pressure was growing on Lambeth Council after it emerged that . Rosie had first come to the attention of the social services 15 years . ago. Questions: Lambeth Council was under pressure last night to reveal how much it knew about the women who were rescued last month . Police are conducting house-to-house inquiries in the area around the housing association flat in Peckford Place, Brixton, south London . Peckford Place: A 30-year-old British woman, a 57-year-old Irish woman and a 69-year-old Malaysian woman were rescued from a house in Lambeth, south London, last month . A senior Lambeth . councillor, who did not wish to be named, said her adoptive parents were . reported to the police because Rosie, who was then 15, was not going to . school. The councillor . said: ‘The police passed the complaint to social services but they said . they weren’t prepared to take any action.’ Another . senior councillor said  Lambeth’s social services, education and . housing departments had all had contact with the household. Last night . Lambeth Council refused to comment. A . man and woman, both 67, were arrested last Thursday but released on . bail after being questioned over false imprisonment and immigration . offences. Last night Theresa May, the Home  Secretary, said tackling modern slavery in Britain was a ‘personal priority’. She . said: ‘It is all around us, hidden in plain sight. Something most of us . thought consigned to history books, belonging to a different century, . is a shameful and shocking presence in modern Britain.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Rosie, 30, penned hundreds of desperate letters and poems from captivity .

"Men who withdraw large sums from their pension pots should be forced to sign a waver admitting they know their widows could be left destitute, Steve Webb has suggested. The Pensions Minister admitted that his new rules allowing people to take lump sums out of their retirement came with risks. But he said it was better to give people choice about how to use their own savings, even if some people 'spend the money too fast'. Pensions minister Steve Webb said it was better to give people choice about how to use their own savings, even if some people 'spend the money too fast' The centrepiece of the Budget in March was a plan to allow people to withdraw their pension pot as a cash lump sum instead of investing in a pension plan, which ministers claim will give people choice to spend their money how they wish. Under the changes workers nearing retirement will be allowed withdraw the cash they have built up in private pension pots. With no need to take out an annuity - paying regular sums for the rest of their life - pensioners will be free to spend their nest eggs as they like. If follows anger from pensioners about the dismal payouts that annuity providers offer. However, critics claimed the law was needed to stop people squandering their money because they do not realise how long they will live. At the time Mr Webb said he would be relaxed if people used their money to buy a Lamborghini, 'and end up on the state pension'. But speaking yesterday he conceded that people needed to be warned about the impact of withdrawing money from a pension pot built up over a lifetime of work. During a hearing in Parliament, he asked the Financial Conduct Authority: 'What thoughts have you had on safeguards? My provider does their bit, tells me guidance is available, I don't take it up, I then make a retirement choice. 'Do you think there's a need for any second defence that I have to sign something that says I'm married and I realise my widow will get nothing?' The pension reforms have triggered a political row erupted over trusting individuals with their own money. But Mr Webb told MPs: 'Yes, some people spend the money too fast, I'm sure that will happen. 'That's the risk when you set people free. But we think the benefit of setting people free to choose for themselves is better than forcing them into a one–size–fits–all model,' the Telegraph reported. When the pension changes were announced in March, Mr Webb said he would be relaxed if people used their money to buy a Lamborghini, 'and end up on the state pension' Ros Altmann, the Government's tsar for older workers, said: 'There is a serious risk not enough people will actually receive the guidance. 'I would like to see additional safeguards to protect consumers beyond relying on the guidance we already know many people may not take up. Consumers have been left in the dark and at the mercy of providers for many years.' Meanwhile, workers who leave their employer after less than two years' service will no longer be pushed into withdrawing their pension contributions. From next October, the practice of 'short service refunds' will be abolished, as part of a radical shake up taking place next year to help retirement savers build up their pension pots. Under the current system, a member of an occupational pension scheme who leaves having completed more than three months but less than two years' qualifying service may be entitled to receive a short service refund. Sometimes this is optional, but in other cases an employer may insist on the refund being taken or a transfer being made to another scheme. The Government intends that, from October 2015, schemes will only be able to make refunds within the first 30 days of membership. Defined benefit (DB) occupational pension schemes and personal pension schemes are not affected.","Steve Webb admits pensions changes carry risks if people spend cash .
New rules mean retirement funds do not need to buy an annuity .
Instead they can withdraw all of the money saved in pension pots ."
"A training-ground injury to United’s Argentine defender Marcos Rojo prompted manager Louis van Gaal to bring Phil Jones back into the team for the first time since the October draw with West Bromwich Albion. In doing so, Van Gaal flew in the face of one of his principles, that a player must train for two weeks before being considered for the first team. Jones actually only returned to training on Thursday. Manchester United defender Phil Jones (right) challenges Liverpool's Raheem Sterling at Old Trafford . A REPRIEVE FOR KOLO . Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers spoke recently about how much his team needed Kolo Toure, while just this week the Ivorian was given the club’s Player of the Month award.

The differences between United manager Louis van Gaal and his former Ajax colleague Ronald Koeman are well known.

"Liverpool have been linked to a businessman with connections to Dubai’s Al Maktoum royal family after owner John W Henry last week flew to the emirate to take part in high-level meetings. Henry travelled to Dubai to meet Marwan Abedin, who is on the board of Dubai’s biggest property developer. Though Liverpool insist the meetings did not concern the football club, their former chief executive Rick Parry was also present and the trip meant Henry missed the Champions League clash with Real Madrid at the Bernabeu, the most prominent match since his takeover of the club. Liverpool owner John W Henry (right) flew to Dubai last week to take part in high-level meetings . Marwan Abedin tweeted this picture of his meeting with the Liverpool owner . Henry flew to Dubai with his wife Linda on what the club say was a personal business trip. There he met Abedin, a man with close connections to the Dubai royal family who launched a takeover bid for the club in 2007. Abedin is also the chief executive of Dubai Healthcare City and on the board of Emaar, the company who built the world’s largest skyscraper, the Burj Khalifa. He has close links to Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the vice-president and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates and constitutional monarch of Dubai. Some reports suggest that Henry’s trip was to secure a naming-rights sponsor for the £75million redevelopment of the new main stand at Anfield. Reports suggested Henry’s trip was to secure a naming-rights sponsor for the redevelopment of Anfield. Henry and his wife also have a shared interest in healthcare with Adebin. The Liverpool owner’s Boston charity, the John W Henry Foundation, states that one of its principal aims is to fund healthcare research and teaching. But the presence of Parry, who advised Henry’s company, NESV, on their purchase of the club in 2010, is intriguing. Parry has denied he has been touring the Middle East on behalf of the club to look for investors and is said simply to be helping Henry because he has good contacts in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. However, the club will need a new shirt sponsor when the current £20m-a-year deal with Standard Chartered runs out at the end of next season. Henry wants the club to develop closer ties in the region in order to exploit commercial opportunities, but has always ruled out selling a stake in the business to Middle East investors.","Liverpool's owner held talks with Marwan Abedin in Dubai .

"Matthew Geater, 20, worked at three separate chains of the Chinese takeaway Hotcha, in Bristol, before being dismissed via Facebook messenger . A takeaway deliver driver has been left jobless after his bosses allegedly sacked him out of the blue via Facebook. Matthew Geater, 20, worked at three separate chains of the Chinese takeaway Hotcha, in Bristol, often notching up 60 hours a week. However, the driver was dismissed from the firm this week with no warning after bosses claimed he failed to turn up for work and had 'attitude'. Mr Geater, who was on a zero hours contract which stated that both parties had to give a week's notice of dismissal, has now been left furious over the way the incident was handled. The only exceptions for him to be given instant dismissal, as stated in his contract, are that of employee misconduct, incompetence or negligence – but he claims he did nothing wrong. He was told that he was being sacked on Facebook messenger, despite never having had a written warning or a complaint against him. Now unemployed, Mr Geater said: 'Firing someone over social media is completely unacceptable to me. It came completely out of the blue, when I was not expecting it, and it is so impersonal. 'I had a good experience of working there and got on with the regional manager. 'I had only been working on Gloucester Road for a week when the manager of that shop told me I was fired. 'I think it was wrong of him - doing it over social media was unprofessional and the least I would have expected is a phone call, or a quick face-to-face chat. 'I don't want anyone else to have this happen to them. It is a horrible thing to pop up when you are just browsing the internet. 'When I first saw the message come through I was in total shock, I almost fell over. I had just been talking to a friend and then this came through. 'The manager didn't even tell me himself, he got someone else to do it. I just can't believe it.' Mr Geater began working at the city's Kingswood branch of the takeaway earlier this year before moving to the Yate outlet four months later in the hope of receiving more hours. However, after realising he was not getting enough work to cover his petrol, he moved to a third outlet in Bristol City Centre where he was promised permanent work. But just four days into the role, Matthew received a private message on Facebook from the trainee manager, telling him the district manager had decided to sack him. The message read: 'I don't no (sic) what has gone on in the other shops but unfortunately you have now been fired from Hotcha. 'Thanks for working for me but there is nothing I can do...you have been fired due to not turning up and your attitude.' Mr Geater worked at three different branches of Chinese takeaway Hotcha in Bristol (one of which is pictured above) before he was dismissed over Facebook messenger for 'failing to turn up to work' and for his 'attitude' He was told that he was no longer entitled to work at the branch as he had been dismissed from earlier jobs with the company for failing to turn up to work. But Mr Geater claims this was not the case and that he had been unfairly dismissed by Hotcha. He said: 'They said that it was because I hadn't turned up to work, but that just isn't true. 'I had a couple of days off for personal grievances and there was another occasion when I had a flat tyre. 'I gave them plenty of notices on both occasions and they were fine with it, they were very supportive. 'I really don't think this is fair and I will battle to make sure this happens to no one else.' His mother, Claire Longman, added: 'I think it is a disgusting, rude way to treat an employee. 'Matthew has always let the company know when he can't work, and them sacking him like this violates his contract.' A spokesman from Hotcha said: 'We are sorry that Mr Geater feels that he has been treated unfairly. 'He did make contact with our head office last Thursday about his grievance and since then we have been attempting to resolve his complaint. 'Hotcha takes any complaint from its employees extremely seriously and would never use Facebook as an appropriate medium to inform a member of staff that they are no longer required. 'We have been trying to contact Mr Geater to clarify who sent the message informing him of his employment status. 'If the message was sent on behalf of Hotcha, this matter will be treated very seriously and thoroughly investigated.'","Matthew Geater dismissed by Chinese takeaway via Facebook messenger .

The Eagles claimed their first away win over their great rivals in the league for seven years in a match which featured only one Portuguese player, Benfica's Andre Almeida, at kickoff. The Primeira Liga leaders went ahead against the run of play in the 36th minute when the Porto defence was caught out by a long thrown-in and the ball bounced in front of Lima who bundled it over the line from six metres.

Lima was clearly delighted with his double, as Benfica extended their lead at the top of the table .

"Thousands of members of the public have chipped in to save the historic Wedgwood Collection for the nation. The collection, which spans more than 250 years of the pottery firm's history, includes more than 80,000 works of art, ceramics and photographs as well as paintings by George Stubbs and Joshua Reynolds. Its future had been in doubt since Waterford Wedgwood Potteries collapsed in 2009 with a £134million pension debt which threatened the future of the museum where it was kept, but a public appeal has raised the final £2.74million needed to safeguard the collection within a month of being launched. Portland Vase at the Wedgwood Museum in Stoke-on-Trent. The collection has been saved after thousands of members of the public chipped in to raise £2.74million in just one month . Slave medallions, 1787: In the 1780s, Josiah Wedgwood, an anti-slavery activist, produced medallions advocating its abolition, made and distributed at his own expense. Bearing the motto ‘Am I not a man and a brother?’, they were tremendously popular . Black basalt rabbit, 1911: This astonishingly modern looking rabbit,with yellowglass eyes,shows just how Wedgwood moved with the times into the 20th Century, with designs showing more wit and becoming less ornate . That amount will be added to the £13million already raised with support from the Heritage Lottery Fund, the Art Fund and a number of private trusts and foundations. Art Fund director Stephen Deuchar said: 'This amazing show of public support for the Wedgwood Collection has made this the fastest fundraising campaign in the Art Fund's 111 year history. 'It demonstrates nothing less than a national passion for Wedgwood - its history, its quality, its brand, its continuity - bringing about a potent combination of donations big and small, ranging from £10 gifts via text to six-figure cheques. Taurus the bull, 1957: Designed in the final Wedgwood glory days by Arnold Machin, the first full-time figure modeller to be employed at their Barlaston factory in Staffordshire. During the war, he had learned to manage without so many craftsmen, so made many works, such as this, out of only two pieces . The First Day’s Vase, 1769 (left) was thrown, hand-crafted, by Josiah Wedgwood  on the first day of production at his Etruria works in Stoke. The Apotheosis of Homer Vase, 1789 (right) depicts the Greek poet being summoned to heaven - an ‘apotheosis’ - because of his brilliance . Egyptian-style teapot with crocodile finial, 1800: Egypt was all the rage, thanks to Horatio Nelson’s victory in the Battle of the Nile in 1798. Wedgwood created a tea service using ancient hieroglyphics. The symbols were purely decorative, however, because their meaning wasn’t discovered until 1822 . 'Britain united to save this collection. Huge thanks to the Heritage Lottery Fund and their ticket buyers too. Together we've ensured that one of the most important collections in the world can continue to be enjoyed by all.' More than 7,000 people donated to the public fundraising campaign with almost a third (30 per cent) coming from the Midlands where the company was traditionally based. The collection will be given to the Victoria and Albert Museum but will remain on display in the museum at the Wedgwood factory site in Barlaston, near Stoke. Dancing Hours, c. 1770: This is one of the best-known Wedgwood bas reliefs, designed in the familiar blue and white colours, and based on a chimney piece from the Palazzo Borghese in Rome. The frieze depicts the mythological Horae, Roman goddesses who personify the hours of the day . Anthony Jones, executive vice president of Wedgwood's parent company WWRD, said: 'Next year sees the launch of the World of Wedgwood, a new attraction that will allow visitors to explore the Wedgwood brand, its products and its history, as part of a unique and truly memorable experience. 'The collection is a key element of the Wedgwood story, bringing to life its rich heritage and craftsmanship. We are delighted its future is secure for the nation and are honoured to contribute to that future through being responsible for the operation of the Wedgwood Museum. 'Our focus now turns to ensuring the museum continues to deliver the high standards of collections care and public benefit for which it has been internationally recognised in recent years.' The firm traces its history back to 1759 when Josiah Wedgwood started work as a potter in Staffordshire. His work transformed the business from a cottage industry into an international success story and one of the world's most famous names in pottery.","Thousands  have chipped in to save the historic Wedgwood Collection .

"The Frequent Locations feature  was quietly introduced to iPhones a year ago . It is tracking your every move – recording the exact time you left for work, where you bought your coffee and where you like to shop. But this isn’t a futuristic spy drone or some sinister Big Brother state – it’s the iPhone sitting in your pocket. Hidden in Apple phones is a function which logs every journey. The iPhones are then able to analyse the data to figure out where you live and work, basing decisions on the frequency and timing of trips. The function – called the Frequent Locations feature – was quietly introduced to iPhones a year ago. But since access to the programme is buried beneath five layers of settings menus, few people know it exists. Apple claims the data never leaves your phone without your permission, and that it was only designed to improve mapping services. But Professor Noel Sharkey, one of Britain’s leading computing experts, described Apple’s ability to track people as ‘terrifying’. ‘This is shocking,’ he said. ‘Every place you go, where you shop, where you have a drink – it is all recorded. This is a divorce lawyer’s dream. But what horrifies me is that it is so secret. Why did we not know about this?’ Smartphones have had the ability to track their owners’ movements since they were first installed with GPS chips and mapping functions. But this feature, which is automatically installed on any iPhone with the iOS 7 or an iOS 8 operating system, is the first to display the movements clearly on a map. The phone records the date of every one of your journeys, your time of arrival and departure and how many times you have been to each address. Apple insists the data only leaves the phone if users gives their consent by selecting the Improve Maps option in the phone’s privacy menu. But campaigners say the data could be seen by a snooping boss, a jealous wife, or even seized by police or an authoritarian government. The revelation comes at the end of a week in which Apple saw £12billion wiped off its value after a glitch left iPhone 6 owners unable to get a signal – and some owners of the new slimline iPhone 6 Plus bent their frames. In an open letter this month, Apple chief executive Tim Cook said: ‘Our business model is very straightforward. We don’t “monetize” the information on your iPhone or in iCloud.’ But Professor Sharkey said: ‘Apple might promise not to use our location information for advertising. And many of our authorities might be quite benevolent at the moment. But if you put that information in someone else’s hands, then it becomes powerful, and in some cases, dangerous.’ To disable Frequent Locations, select Clear History and make sure Improve Maps is deselected . The Frequent Locations function is automatically installed on any phone with iOS 7 or iOS 8. To access Frequent Locations, go into Settings, choose the Privacy option and then Location Services.

To disable Frequent Locations, select Clear History and make sure Improve Maps is deselected. Finally, turn off the Frequent Locations tab. This does not stop data being recorded, it only stops it being packaged up in a map. To stop it being logged at all, you can disable Location Services in the Privacy menu – but this will leave you unable to use your phone’s mapping software.","Hidden in Apple phones is a function which logs every journey you take .

Of those polled, 28 per cent ranked Rome at the top of their list of love spots, followed by Venice (21 per cent), which recently played host to the wedding of actor George Clooney and British human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin. Paris was relegated to fifth spot on the list with just nine per cent of respondents considering it the top city for a romantic getaway. Prague came in third (16 per cent) while Bruges ranked fourth (11 per cent), according to the survey commissioned by holiday price comparison website Icelolly. Florence, which played host to Kanye West and Kim Kardashian's wedding bash in May did not make the top ten. Best nightlife? Berlin beat Ibiza and Las Vegas as the best party destination . Young women dance at a nightclub in Miami's South Beach district . When it comes to raucous nightlife, two of the usual suspects – Ibiza and Las Vegas – failed to crack the top five. Nearly a quarter of those polled (23 per cent) listed Berlin as the real Sin City, followed by Istanbul (18 per cent), Miami (14 per cent), Brussels (11 per cent) and Amsterdam (ten per cent). Ibiza (eight per cent) and Las Vegas (five per cent) finished seventh and eighth, respectively. All night long: Holidaymakers named Tokyo as the true city that never sleeps - not New York . New York claims to be the city that never sleeps but it ranked fifth on a list of the top sleepless cities . And it turns out Tokyo is the metropolis that holidaymakers consider to be the true city that never sleeps – not New York. Thirty-one per cent of respondents put Tokyo at the top of their list of sleepless cities, with New York ranking fifth behind Mexico City, Barcelona and Moscow. Suniel Makh, brand director at Icelolly, said: ‘Certain facts that we used to take for granted are now being seriously contested, such as where to go for the most romantic time or craziest parties. ‘Some couples have grown tired of the Eiffel Tower and Champs Elysees, it feels like déjà vu and they’re looking for new and exciting alternatives instead.’","Survey of tourists suggests some cities aren't living up to their nicknames .

"A new study is set to reveal how personality impacts the commenting behaviour of people reading online news websites. The research will examine why readers choose to comment on news stories and which personalities are likely to take part in aggressive 'keyboard warrior' discussions or trolling behaviour. Previous studies show commenters on general websites are extroverts, narcissistic and conscientious and the new study hopes to reveal whether these personality traits are more common on news websites. A new study is set to reveal how personality impacts the commenting behaviour of readers on news websites . Journalism lecturer Dr Renee Barnes of The University of the Sunshine Coast . The University of the Sunshine Coast study, led by journalism lecturer Dr Renee Barnes and psychologist Professor Doug Mahar in Queensland's southeast, will examine which readers are more likely to leave repeated comments or engage with other users. Dr Barnes said the main aim of the research is to identify which comments are linked to extroverts or anonymous individuals. The lecturer said there are a number of factors which may prompt people to comment on news stories. 'People who aren't frequent commenters, when they do comment it is because there's something particular in the story that really resonates with them,' she told the ABC . 'They might feel they have personal information on that story, or some sort of expertise.' Dr Barnes added that the reader's relationship with a journalist may also influence their comments while others will post their views simply because they agree or disagree with others. This follows previous research which revealed commenters on general websites have personality traits which include extraversion, neuroticism, openness, agreeableness, conscientiousness and narcissism. Professor Mahar said the new survey will determine whether the similar traits were more common on news websites as opposed to others sites. Dr Barnes said in the second part of the survey, people will be asked to provide information such as their usernames and which websites they frequently post comments on. 'Then we are going to go and look at their comments so we can match that up with how they're testing in their personality,' she said. The study will examine what leads people to comment on news stories and which personalities take part in aggressive 'keyboard warrior' discussions and trolling behaviour .","Study will examine which personalities are likely to take part in online discussion or trolling behaviour on news websites .

"A Texas prosecutor's office says it knew nothing of a 2004 attack on an Indiana woman when it offered a lighter sentence in a 2009 sexual assault case to a man now suspected of several killings. In a statement Monday, Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg said she offered Darren Vann a plea deal of five years' imprisonment in the 2009 case because it was weakened by the victim's delayed outcry, a resulting loss of DNA evidence and her inconsistent statements. The original charge could have meant up to 99 years in prison. Lehmberg said Vann's criminal history then 'revealed no prior history of sexual assault and no prior convictions.' Lehmberg spokesman Rudy Magallanes said the 2004 case didn't appear in Vann's criminal history. Police in Indiana say Vann has confessed to killing seven women. Case: Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, right, said she offered Darren Vann, left, a plea deal of five years' imprisonment in a Texas 2009 sexual assault case because it had been weakened. Police in Indian say Vann recently confessed to killing seven women . Victim: Vann has been charged in the death of Afrikka Hardy, pictured, whose body was found October 17, 2014 in a bathtub at a Motel 6 in Hammond, Indiana. Authorities say Vann has confessed to killing her . Last Wednesday, Vann refused to speak or even acknowledge his name to a judge, and a sheriff explained later that the suspect was upset his hearing was in open court before dozens of journalists. The judge asked Vann, 43, of Gary, Indiana, at his initial court appearance if he understood the reason for the hearing in the strangulation death of 19-year-old Afrikka Hardy. But Vann stood unmoving and stone-faced, staring back silently at the judge. 'Mr. Vann, are you choosing not to take part in this hearing?' Magistrate Judge Kathleen Sullivan asked Vann sternly. When Vann — wearing striped jail garb, with his wrists and legs shackled and flanked by two guards at the lockup — still offered no response, Sullivan told his public defender to 'tell your client that he stays in jail the rest of his life until this hearing takes place.' Putting his hand on Vann's shoulder, public defender Matthew Fech, encouraged him to speak — but he again stood silently. The judge then found him in contempt and said she would schedule another hearing for this week. Before entering the room, Vann had peered through a window at spectator benches, asking why so many journalists were there and refusing to even enter, Lake County Sheriff John Buncich said later. Fech finally convinced Vann to at least enter. Until the October 22 hearing in Crown Point, the sheriff said Vann's demeanor had been 'quiet, calm and collected,' which included confessing to investigators and leading police to abandoned homes where several bodies were hidden. Deaths: The bodies of Teaira Bately (left) and Anith Jones (right) were found last weekend in Indiana . Authorities: Lake County Coroner Merrilee Frey, speaks during a news conference, Wednesday, October 22, 2014 in Crown Point, Indiana. Darren Vann is set to appear in a court hearing this week . Vann is held in isolation on 24-hour-a-day watch in jail, Bunich said, so it's unclear how the contempt charge will alter his status. His silence, if it persists, could raise complicated legal questions that might severely slow the prosecution process. At the 10-minute hearing, the judge also issued a gag order, meaning investigators can no longer interview Vann unless they first get his permission through his attorney. Authorities, who had provided details of the case, can also no longer discuss it publicly. Vann, a convicted sex offender, was arrested October 18 and charged with the strangulation death of Hardy, whose body was found October 17 in a bathtub at a Motel 6 in Hammond, 20 miles southeast of Chicago. On October 22, he also was charged in the death of 35-year-old Anith Jones of, Merrillville, Indiana, whose body was found in an abandoned house Saturday night in Gary. Five more bodies were found October 19 in other homes, said Hammond Police Chief John Doughty, who identified two of the women as Gary residents Teaira Batey, 28, and Kristine Williams, 36. Lake County Coroner Merilee Frey said three bodies remain unidentified, one was found with a silver-colored bracelet with the words 'Best Aunt.' But bodies were largely skeletonized so other markings, like identifying scars or birthmarks, weren't present. Members of 17 different families have called the coroner's office inquiring about the bodies, and one call led to DNA tests on the third unidentified victim, Frey said. Scene: This October 20, 2014 file photo shows an abandoned home in Gary, Indiania where police found the one of six women's bodies . House of horros: Another body was found inside this separate residence, also in Gary, Indiana . Investigators in Indiana and Texas, where Vann also lived, have been poring over cold case files and missing person reports to determine if there are more victims. Inquiries were also being made in Illinois. Hammond Police discovered information indicating Vann may have been in various communities just across the state line in Illinois in Cook County between the day Hardy's body was found and when Vann was arrested. Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart confirmed that 'through technology' investigators believe that Vann was in the area of Hazelcrest, Markham and Harvey then, but he wouldn't elaborate. But a law enforcement official close to the investigation said what Hammond investigators gave to the sheriff's department were cellphone records tracking Vann's phone through the region. The official, who was not authorized to speak about the investigation and would only discuss it anonymously, said investigators were also informed Vann told detectives that after a killing he would visit abandoned buildings where he'd stashed previous victims to ensure bodies had not been discovered. Vann was convicted in 2009 of raping a woman in his Austin, Texas, apartment. He was released from prison last year and moved back to Indiana. Before that conviction, he served a year in prison in Indiana after he grabbed a Gary woman in a chokehold in 2004, doused her with gasoline and threatened to set her on fire. In both cases, the charges against Vann were reduced in plea bargains, and Texas officials deemed him a low risk for violence. Vann registered as a sex offender in Indiana and police made a routine check in September that he lived at the address he provided. Sherriff Buncich said he wished registered sex offenders, like Vann, could be monitored more closely than they are but that budgetary and legal constraints make that difficult.","A Texas prosecutor's office says it knew nothing of a 2004 attack on an Indiana woman when it offered a lighter sentence in a 2009 sexual assault case to Darren Vann .

"A massive multi-national exercise in anti-naval mine training descended on coastlines across the Middle East last week and, in addition, to thousands of sailors from over 40 world navies, some explosives-sniffing California sea lions showed up to show off their skills. The International Mine Countermeasures Exercise or IMCMEX, the largest exercise of its kind, exists to help preserve the safety of the world's shipping lanes and the global commerce they make possible. The sea lions equipped with lasers and sonar were deployed for the first time ever to detect and remove objects, as well as secure harbors and hard-to-reach underwater areas. Salute: A US Navy Marine Mammal Program (NMMP) California sea lion named Jack salutes his handler in Bahrain, where he's part of the world's largest ever maritime exercise focused on protecting the world's shipping lanes . Job well done: Here, a sea lion named Codi--equipped with a laser guidance system--shakes hands with his handler near the Bahraini capital of Manama . Making a splash: A sea lion with laser and sonar devices attached to its back jumps into a boat during a media demonstration of the International Mine Countermeasures Exercise . A total of 44 nations from six continents with more then 6,500 personnel are taking part in IMCMEX. They've gathered from the northern Persian Gulf to the northern Red Sea. The marine mammal program is several decades old. Dolphins and sea lions were used during the Vietnam War and Operation Iraqi Freedom. None of the animals were harmed in the anti-terrorist work and they never have to carry live mines. Instead, they find the devices and place markers on them before Navy divers retrieve and defuse the devices. In addition to the impressive sea lions, this year's exercises include aerial vehicles capable of detecting and destroying mines below the water surface. The new Airborne Laser Mine Detection System (ALMDS) 'is a sensor system designed to detect, classify and localize floating and near-surface moored mines' according to the official blog of the U.S. Navy. Don't do the diffusing: The sea lions identify and tags naval mines in order for them to be defused by Navy divers . Unique talents: Sea lions equipped with lasers and sonar are deployed for the first time to detect and remove objects, as well as secure harbors and underwater areas which are hard to reach, according to officials . Not just sea lions; The drill is the world's largest naval exercise with 44 countries from six continents taking part in it with more than 6,500 sailors from the participating navies taking part in the drills which have been broadened to include maritime security operations and protect maritime infrastructure . Thar she blows: The at-sea portion of the exercises, which began this week following a 3-say symposium in Bahrain, has 38 ships, 19 unmanned underwater vehicles, and some 100 divers included from all participating nations . According to Vice Admiral John Miller of U.S. Naval Forces Central Command/U.S. Fifth Fleet, . The at-sea portion of the exercises, which began this week following a 3-say symposium in Bahrain, has 38 ships, 19 unmanned underwater vehicles, and some 100 divers included from all participating nations. 'This year’s IMCMEX is significantly more complex than previous editions of this exercise, with more ships, more nations and more Sailors operating as an international force training to protect the world’s sea-lanes,' said Vice Admiral Miller. Miller emphasized the importance of the area for international commerce. 'Nearly 20 percent of the world’s oil transits through the Strait of Hormuz every day. Imagine the impact on the global economy if suddenly that oil stops flowing because of restricted sea-lanes. This region is clearly important to the whole world,' he said.

"Holidaymakers in their hordes were left frustrated this summer, with as many as one in five flights from the UK delayed, according to new figures. Departures from Gatwick to Spain the were worst affected, with flights from the airport to Barcelona registering the highest number of UK flights with a delay of more than three hours. For flights delayed by more than three hours, the average delay was four hours 42 minutes, the figures from flightright.co.uk reveal. In total, about 161,570 of the 752,000 flights that passed through UK airports this summer were delayed . London Gatwick to Barcelona-El Prat . London Gatwick to Palma de Mallorca . Manchester to Palma de Mallorca . London Gatwick to Faro . London Gatwick to Málaga . London City to Paris Orly . London Heathrow to Frankfurt . London Heathrow to Düsseldorf .

According to the statistics,  161,570 of the estimated 752,000 flights that passed through UK airports this summer were delayed, representing 21 per cent of all flights. This was a 10 per cent uplift in the number of delays on last year. The results indicate that about 397,000 UK air passengers are entitled to more than £128m in untapped compensation for flights delayed or cancelled over the June to August period. The five routes from UK airports to European destinations which registered the most flights with a delay of more than three hours were Gatwick to Barcelona, Palma de Mallorca, Faro and Malaga, as well as Manchester airport to Malaga. While routes with the most reported cancellations were London City to Paris Orly and Zurich and Heathrow to Frankfurt, Dusseldorf and Amsterdam Schipol. Flights from Gatwick to Barcelona had the highest number of flights with delays of more than three hours . Marek Janetzke, Managing Director of flightright, said: 'UK passengers have up to six years to make a claim compensation so it's not too late to claim for flight delays over the summer. 'Often people are unaware that it only takes a three-hour delay to be eligible for compensation of around £200. 'Potential compensation can reach up to £475 per passenger depending on the flight distance and delay time. 'Unfortunately most passengers do not know about their rights. 'Airlines mostly leave them without any information about it or even negate that their customers are entitled to compensation.'

"Courage: Lance Corporal James Ashworth is only the tenth British soldier to be awarded the Victoria Cross since the Second World War . Their pride mingled with sorrow, the family of the Grenadier Guardsman awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross in Afghanistan learned yesterday the full extent of his heroism. Lance Corporal James Ashworth, 23, died as he led his team in storming a Taliban stronghold. He was gunned down as he attempted to throw his final grenade at a sniper. His mother Kerry, father Duane - himself a former Grenadier - and brother Coran, 22, a serving soldier, were at the regiment's barracks in Aldershot to hear the VC citation read by Lieutenant General Adrian Bradshaw, the Commander Land Forces. He said L/Cpl Ashworth had shown 'immense courage, which represents the very best of his generation'. The Grenadier Guard fell as he selflessly disregarded . ferocious enemy fire from just a few metres in a bid to hurl a grenade at an . insurgent sharpshooter. It has been reported that the 6'8"" soldier killed three . Taliban fighters during the close-quarters assault in Helmand. His bravery persuaded senior officers to recommend the . soldier - known by his friends as a 'gentle giant' - for the VC. The award stated: 'Despite the ferocity of the insurgent's . resistance, Ashworth refused to be beaten. 'His total disregard for his own safety in ensuring that the . last grenade was posted accurately was the gallant last action of a soldier who . had willingly placed himself in the line of fire on numerous occasions earlier . in the attack. 'This supremely courageous and inspiring action deserves the . highest recognition.' Mrs Ashworth, 44, from Corby, Northamptonshire, said the family was 'ecstatically happy' his heroism is being honoured. Proud: (L-R) Father and former Grenadier Guardsman Duane Ashworth, serving soldier and brother of James Coran Ashworth and mother Kerry Ashworth at Buller Barracks in Aldershot . Deserved: Commander Land Forces Lieutenant General Adrian Bradshaw speaks at the press conference . 'If anyone was in . trouble he would go and help them. He was like that from a young age,' she said. 'this award doesn't make it easier but it does make it feel . that it wasn't for nothing.' 'We never in our wildest dreams expected this,' she said. 'I . miss his smile. He’s got the best smile anyone could ever have. He . always smiles... and his hugs. I just love him so much,' she said. 'We . just miss him so much, but this award is not just for James it’s for . everybody who fights and who has been injured and the whole town is so . proud of him,' she said. 'I didn't know the full extent [of what he had done]. I knew . a bit about what happened and I know when we came to meet the soldiers they . were saying how wonderful he was, but I never in my life expected this. Tribute: The repatriation ceremony for Lance Corporal James Ashworth after he died in Afghanistan last June . Mr Ashworth, 44, a holiday complex manager, added: 'We knew . what he had done was exceptional. That is the sort of thing you know he would . do.' The VC has been awarded just ten times to UK soldiers since . the Second World War. The posthumous honour to L/Cpl Ashworth, of the 1st . Battalion the Grenadier Guards, is just the second from the 12-year conflict in . Afghanistan. The Army said that the soldier, from Corby, . Northamptonshire, was leading a 25-man reconnaissance patrol on a mission to a . Taliban-occupied village. But the unit came under fire from insurgents with rifles and . an enemy sharpshooter. L/Cpl Ashworth immediately took the decision to lead his . team in a 300metre charge to the enemy mud compound in a local village in . Nahr-e Seraj district, the scene of fierce fighting. Hero: James Ashwoth was just the tenth person since the Second World War to be awarded a VC . Two insurgents were killed in the initial attack but a . follow-up assault stalled when an Afghan policeman was killed as the enemy . fled. An Army spokesman said: 'With no regard for his own safety, . L/Cpl Ashworth again led from the front of his team, advancing on an insurgent . compound and using grenades to drive the final remaining enemy to an . outbuilding. 'The insurgent was now being supported by fire from several . positions, with the enemy desperate to protect their sharpshooter team. 'The immediate priority for L/Cpl Ashworth's team was now to . neutralise the final sharpshooter and extract as soon as possible. 'Seeking to break the stalemate using his final grenade, . L/Cpl Ashworth dropped to the floor and crawled behind a knee-high wall that . ran parallel to the front of the outbuilding. Bravery: Major Andy Parker speaking at the conference where James Ashworth was honoured . 'With just enough cover to conceal his prostrate form, he . inched forward on his belly. 'Bullets flew over his head as he edged forward and the . enemy continued to engage the rest of his team. 'When he was within five metres of the insurgent's position . L/Cpl Ashworth was desperate to make his last grenade count. 'He deliberately crawled out from behind the wall, exposing . himself to fire to get a better angle for his throw. 'L/Cpl Ashworth was now in full view of the enemy just . metres away, with rounds hitting the floor just centimetres around him. 'He was preparing to throw the grenade when he was . tragically hit by enemy fire.' After hearing the citation read, Mrs Ashworth said: 'We just miss him so much, but this award is not just for . James it's for everybody who fights and who has been injured and the whole town . is so proud of him.' She added: 'I talk to him on Facebook and I have children . and grandchildren and that does help, but some days it's really hard and I go . and visit him at his grave - you cope as best you can.' Valour: Colleagues said Lance Corporal James Ashworth showed extraordinary courage to protect his comrades during the firefight in Afghanistan (file photo) Lieutenant General Adrian Bradshaw, Commander Land . Forces, said L/Cpl Ashworth had shown 'immense courage, which represents the . very best of his generation'. He added: 'James' loss is deeply felt by all in his regiment . and all in the British Army. 'No award can possibly fill the hole left by the loss of a . son, brother and comrade. 'The whole of the Grenadier Guards are justified in feeling . enormous pride that this award has been announced.' Unique: The Victoria Cross medal is cast from the metal of Russian guns captured during the Crimean War . The Victoria Cross ranks as the nation's highest award for gallantry, along with the George Cross. Instituted by Queen Victoria in 1856, the Victoria Cross is awarded for 'most conspicuous bravery, or some daring or pre-eminent act of valour or self-sacrifice, or extreme devotion to duty in the presence of the enemy.' It is hand-made from bronze cannon captured from the Russians at . the siege of Sevastopol in 1854-55 during the Crimean War. The bronze cross, which has a crimson ribbon bears the inscription 'For Valour', is cast from the metal of Russian guns captured at the siege of Sevastopol during the Crimean War, the campaign in which the first medals were awarded. The Victoria Cross may be awarded to all ranks of the services - and also to civilians - to recognise gallantry in the presence of the enemy. The medal has been awarded 1,356 times, the most recent of which was a posthumous award to Corporal Bryan Budd, of the 3rd Battalion The Parachute Regiment, for acts of ""inspirational leadership and the greatest valour"" in southern Afghanistan in 2006. Only 13 Victoria Cross medals have been awarded since the Second World War, nine to members of the British Army and four to the Australian Army. L/Cpl Ashworth's is just the fifth to have been awarded since the Falklands conflict, and all but one have been posthumous. Private Johnson Beharry, from 1st Battalion the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment, was awarded the honour for two separate acts of outstanding gallantry to rescue his comrades in Iraq in 2004, during which suffered serious head injuries. The Victoria Cross has been awarded to the same person twice on three occasions - to doctors Captain Arthur Martin-Leake (1902 and 1914) and Captain Noel Chavasse (1916 and posthumously 1917), and New Zealander Captain Charles Upham (1941 and 1942). The George Cross, which stands equal to the Victoria Cross as an award, recognises acts of gallantry by members of the Armed Forces or civilians in situations for which the Victoria Cross is not appropriate. These can be incidents that are not in the presence of the enemy, such as bomb or mine disposal.","Lance Corporal James Ashworth given nation's highest honour for bravery .

"Sugar Puffs (pictured in their current form) will be being rebranded as 'Honey Monster Puffs' and will contain less sugar and 20 per cent more honey . Sugar Puffs are being given a makeover in an attempt to address parents' concerns about the amount of sugar in the cereal - and revive plunging sales. Rebranded as 'Honey Monster Puffs' after the yellow furry  character featured in previous adverts, they will be made from a new recipe with less sugar and 20 per cent more honey. The cereal will also feature traffic light nutritional labelling on the front of the pack, in a move manufacturers Halo Foods said would allow customers to make 'informed decisions' about what they eat for breakfast. Overall, manufacturers say the sugar content has been reduced by a third in a decade. Honey Monster Puffs will contain 8.6g of sugar – a cube and a half – in a 30g portion, down from the previous recipe which contained almost two cubes per portion. However critics say the move is largely a marketing ploy - as once broken down, honey and added sugar become the same thing - glucose. Dietitian Helen Bond told MailOnline: 'Added sugar and honey are grouped in the same category by the UK Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition. 'Although honey is seen as more ""natural"" than added sugar, it is still counted as a ""free sugar"" - i.e. one that has been added to a product rather than say lactose, a sugar found naturally in milk. 'Once broken down in the body, honey will do exactly the same thing as the added sugar would have.' In comparison to Sugar Puffs, Coco Pops and Frosties contain 11g of sugar per portion - more than two cubes. Tesco Chocco Snaps contain 9.8 g of sugar (almost two cubes), and Kellogs Krave contains 9g. Readybrek Chocolate has 6g of sugar in each portion - just over one cube - but Readybrek original contains no sugar at all. Cheerios similarly contain 6g of sugar for each 30g and Rice Krispies contain 3g of sugar per portion, just over half a cube. Breakfast cereals have faced a backlash in recent years, with critics claiming products with a high sugar content are being dressed up as a healthy option. In 2012 an investigation by Which? Found that Sugar Puffs were the third most sugary breakfast cereal marketed towards children. Scroll down for video . The Honey Monster is being revived as part of a £3 million marketing campaign in 2015 to advertise the products, after a backlash against breakfast cereals with a high sugar content . Such products are laden with so much sugar they ought to be sold alongside chocolate biscuits, not marketed as a recipe for a healthy life, investigators said. In June shadow health secretary Andy Burnham announced that a Labour government would cap the amount of sugar in breakfast cereals in a bid to tackle childhood obesity. Honey Monster Puffs will contain 8.6g of sugar – a cube and a half – in a 30g portion, down from the previous recipe which contained almost two cubes per portion. Comparably, Coco Pops and Frosties contains 11g of sugar per portion, more than two cubes. Tesco Chocco Snaps contains 9.8 g of sugar (almost two cubes), and Kellogs Krave contains 9g. Readybrek Chocolate has 6g of sugar in each portion - just over one cube - but Readybrek original contains no sugar at all. Cheerios similarly contained 6g of sugar for each 30g and Rice Krispies contained 3g of sugar per portion, just over half a cube. The move came after the World Health Organisation announced adults should halve their average intake to six teaspoons a day (almost five cubes) to avoid obesity, heart disease and other serious illnesses. Halo Foods is planning a £3 million marketing campaign in 2015 to further drive sales of the new product, centered around the return of the Honey Monster, The Grocer magazine reported. They are hoping to tap into nostalgia for the furry yellow character, who was first seen on screens in 1976. Andy Valentine, Marketing Director at Halo Foods, said: 'The Honey Monster was a staple of family breakfasts for decades. 'Our research has shown us that consumers still have a strong feeling of nostalgia, trust and loyalty towards him, so it's fantastic that we're able to bring him back.' He added: 'Despite a lack of investment for the last few years under previous owners, Honey Monster Puffs has maintained a position as the number 18 brand in the UK cereal category. 'We feel that the product re-launch, coupled with our move to bring the product name in line with the iconic Honey Monster character, can only amplify this position and help grow our share of the cereals category.'","Sugar Puffs being rebranded as Honey Monster Puffs .

"A former Baltimore Ravens cheerleader and the estranged wife of a prominent Maryland energy executive has been arrested and charged in connection with a sexual relationship involving a 15-year-old boy. Molly Shattuck, 47, was indicted on Monday on two counts of third-degree rape, four counts of unlawful sexual contact and three counts of providing alcohol to minors, Delaware State Police Sgt. Paul Shavack said. She was released on $84,000 bond after an arraignment on Wednesday in Sussex County Superior Court in Georgetown, Delaware. Scroll down for video . Molly Shattuck, 47, was indicted on Monday on two counts of third-degree rape, four counts of unlawful sexual contact and three counts of providing alcohol to minors . Mother-of-three Shattuck met her victim on Instagram in May and passed on her phone number, according to court affidavits  seen by WBALTV. The pair started talking and eventually met in Columbia after she picked him up and drove him to a middle school parking lot. According to the documents, Shattuck and the boy met 'almost a half-dozen times' during July. But the relationship ended over the Labor Day weekend, Schavack said. Shattuck and her children, plus her kids' friends were staying in a rented beach house in Bethany Beach when the boy stayed over one night. 'Sometime around 2 a.m. Sunday morning, they drove to a liquor store and (Molly) Shattuck purchased a 12-pack of Miller Lite and a 12-pack of Bud Light for them,' state the court documents. Baltimore native Shattuck became the oldest NFL cheerleader in history when she cheered for the Ravens in 2005 . Shattuck had rented this beach house in Bethany Beach over the Labor Day weekend when the unnamed 15-year-old boy came to stay for a night . Once back at the house, Shattuck is alleged to have performed oral sex on the boy at least twice - first outside the home while walking the dog and then again in her bedroom. The documents state '(the boy) described the undergarments (Molly) Shattuck was wearing when he entered her bedroom.' The documents say she allegedly  told the boy 'if he wanted to have sex she would. The boy opted out. He decided to leave. At that point, she told him to come back later but he did not go back.' The next day the boy's father collected him. On September 26, the boy's family reported the incident to the police who executed a search warrant at Molly Shattuck's $2.5 million home on October 1. Molly Shattuck is separated from prominent Maryland energy executive Mayo Shattuck, 60, the current chairman of energy provider Exelon . Shattuck was released on $84,000 bond after an arraignment on Wednesday in Sussex County Superior Court in Georgetown, Delaware . Investigators were looking for, among other things, Shattuck's cellphone and pink underwear. Sgt. Paul Shavack refused to confirm which items had been removed as possible evidence. The headmaster at the boy’s school have since banned Shattuck from entering the campus . In an email sent to the campus community, McDonogh School Headmaster Charles Britton sent an e-mail to the campus community said additional security measures have been put in place. Shattuck is separated from Mayo Shattuck, 60, the former CEO of Baltimore-based Constellation Energy Nuclear Group and the current chairman of Chicago-based Exelon Corp., also an energy provider. Exelon, which has electric and gas utilities in Maryland, Illinois, and Pennsylvania, now owns Constellation. In 2005, Molly Shattuck, a Baltimore native, became the oldest NFL cheerleader in history up to that time when the Ravens selected her for the squad on her first tryout. She cheered for two years and was a part-time coach for six more years. Shattuck also is a fitness consultant and advocate, and published a book in February called Vibrant Living. Shattuck was indicted on Monday on two counts of third-degree rape, four counts of unlawful sexual contact and three counts of providing alcohol to minors . Police executed a search warrant at Molly Shattuck's $2.5 million five-bedroom, 5.5-bathroom Maryland home on October 1 . Her website, which is in 'maintenance mode' on Wednesday morning, says she has implemented a 21-day plan for health and improved living with people, companies and groups across the U.S. for the past several years. A cached version of her biography on the site says she is an ambassador for the American Diabetes Association and works with the American Heart Association and United Way of Central Maryland's Access to Healthy Food Initiative. She's a trustee of the United Way of Central Maryland, and a member of boards for the Baltimore School for the Arts, the Johns Hopkins Children's Center and the National Children's Museum. In 2008, Shattuck appeared on an episode of the ABC-TV reality show Secret Millionaire and gave away $190,000 to people helping the poor. Her website says she has three children, including a 15-year-old son. According to online Maryland court records, Molly and Mayo Shattuck filed for divorce September 29 in Baltimore County. The Baltimore Sun reported in March that the couple had separated, although Molly Shattuck demurred to the newspaper about when the breakup occurred, saying, 'It's been awhile.' Shattuck also is a fitness consultant and advocate, and published a book in February called Vibrant Living .","Mother-of-three Molly Shattuck, 47, has been arrested and charged in connection with a sexual relationship involving a 15-year-old boy .

"Jailed: Christopher Holloway, 32, of Raglan, south east Wales, ran a sophisticated website selling legal highs to customers around the world . A drug dealer raked in £2.5million funding a 'lavish lifestyle' which included luxury holidays to Las Vegas by selling legal highs through a website operated from his home. Christopher Holloway, 32, of Raglan, south east Wales, imported substances before mixing and packaging them for sale as 'research chemicals' - understood by customers to be legal highs. When police raided his home they seized 8kg of drugs with a street value in excess of £3.5million. The dealer was also found to have a staggering £1million in his bank account, Newport Crown Court heard. The court also heard how he spent five weeks on holiday in Las Vegas - where he blew £25,000 gambling in the city's casinos. While there, he stayed exclusively at expensive hotels such as the Bellagio and MGM Grand, and would usually hire a Porsche or Lamborghini for the trips so that he could 'arrive in style'. His complex drug dealing operation was first detected by Border Agency staff in June 2012. A package from China was intercepted at the Parcel Force depot in Coventry - it was destined for Raglan and labelled 'samples' but contained just under 1kg of a Class B drug. Police said Holloway was running a sophisticated operation out of his own home and was selling drugs to people across the world. When he was arrested, police found evidence of more than 13,000 sales worldwide, including Scotland, Jersey, Tokyo and California. Online purchases were even being made while the police were searching his home. Detective Chief Inspector Roger Fortey, of Gwent Police, said drugs seized from Holloway were forensically tested and found to be 'far from safe'. Many of the substances seized contained Class A, B and C drugs. Prolific: His website 'Benzofury' made him up to £2.5million and police found records of more than 13,000 sales . Stash: When police officers raided his home they found drugs with a street value of up to £3.5million along with a haul of materials used to package his products for export . Mr Fortey claimed taking legal highs using the substances seized from Holloway's haul would be like 'playing Russian Roulette with your health'. He added: 'The phrase 'legal highs' portrays an image of the substances being legal and hence safe. These substances contain dangerous, harmful and untested chemicals.' Police closed down Holloway's 'Benzofury' website only for him to create another site to continue selling drugs. This site has also been closed. Today, Holloway pleaded guilty to importation of controlled drugs, possession with intent to supply controlled drugs, supplying controlled drugs and money laundering. He was jailed for 10 years. Holloway came under suspicion when a package from China was intercepted at the Parcel Force depot in Coventry - destined for his home in Raglan and labelled 'samples', it contained just under 1kg of a Class B drug . Sophisticated: As part of Holloway's operation he would import substances before mixing and packaging them for sale as 'research chemicals' - understood by customers to be legal highs . Benzo Fury, the title of Holloway's website, is the name of a former legal high that was banned last year and labelled as a class B substance - following a review from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD). The move came after the drug was linked to a series of deaths in 2013. Benzo fury is a man-made amphetamine which can give users a euphoric high. It induces feelings of empathy similar to Class A drug ecstasy and its side effects include loss of appetite, hallucinations and paranoia.","Christopher Holloway, 32, of Wales, sold to customers around the world .

"Matthew Gibson could have easily gotten away with murder - but then Walmart intervened. Gibson, apparently racked with guilt, drove across the country to confess bludgeoning to death Barbara Leone Brown with a flashlight more than 15 years ago after getting some cryptic messages from the big-box retailer. The 55-year-old man was sentenced to 10 years in prison after driving from North Carolina to Arizona to turn himself in to face charges that a prosecutor said wouldn't have come without the 55-year-old's surrender. Unclean conscience: Matthew Gibson, 55, raced 1,800 across the US to confess to the 1997 murder of Barbara Leone Brown after receiving messages from Walmart about a woman's prescription . 'His name was never in any report. We didn't even know he existed,' Mohave County assistant prosecutor Jace Zack said Tuesday. 'I am 100 per cent certain that he would not have been caught if he didn't turn himself in,' he said. The 1997 death of Barbara Leone Brown, from Arizona, in the Colorado River town of Bullhead City in western Arizona has agonized Gibson, who has found religion, his attorney Ron Gilleo said. 'He just wanted it off his chest,' Gilleo said. Gibson, a former cocaine and meth addict, provided a written statement to authorities last month. 'Only the good Lord knows what that night was all about, but I'm deeply sorry for that night,' he wrote. 'For years now, I have weeped (sic) over this and it has been heavy on my soul.' His lawyer said the feeling propelled Gibson to drive about 1,800 miles this summer from Vilas, North Carolina, to Winslow, Arizona, where he went to police. But detective Alicia Marquez, with the Winslow Police Department, told the Charlotte Observer that Gibson grew paranoid that someone had found out about the murder. The man grew suspicious after he began receiving text messages and voice mails from Walmart telling him that Anita Townsend’s prescription was ready for pickup. Gibson did not know the name of the woman he killed, so he concluded that Anita Townsend must have been the victim, and that someone was playing games with him. When he was sent an envelope containing an ad from Walmart but no return label, he came to believe that someone has put ‘a contract on his head.’ Cold case: Police mug shot of Gibson, who has been sentenced to 10 years in prison after turning himself in to face charges that a prosecutor said wouldn't have come without the 55-year-old's surrender . Last June, Gibson got behind the wheel of his car in North Carolina and raced across the country without rest until he arrived at the Winslow Police Department, where he finally came clean about the crime. Brown's body was found years ago in thick bushes along the river. She had multiple skull fractures. Her husband had reported her missing several days earlier. Gibson provided information that fit Brown's death, according to Bullhead City police. Authorities said he told them he and the 38-year-old woman had argued because she refused to leave his home, that he hit her with a flashlight and dumped her body after she died from the injury. The two weren't romantically involved, Zack said. Mohave County Superior Court judge Rick Williams sentenced Gibson on Friday. Gibson surrendered in June to police in Winslow, about 200 miles east of Kingman, where the woman lived.","Matthew Gibson, 55, was sentenced to 10 years in prison after he admitted to bludgeoning Barbara Leone Brown, 38, to death with a flashlight .

"One of the most bizarre decisions of the season so far occurred in Belgium on Saturday afternoon between Genk and Kortrijk. The visitors were denied a seemingly perfectly legitimate goal inside the opening 15 minutes, with referee Nicolas Laforge deeming the ball had gone out of play before re-entering the field and ending up in the back of the net - ruling out the effort. The Kortrijk players were left flabbergasted at the decision, expressing their disbelief at Laforge - who instead awarded a corner.

"A teenager was found dead in wetlands after leaving her home barefoot in December following a row with her family, an inquest heard. Nida Naseer vanished from her parents' house in Newport, South Wales, last December after an argument over 'cultural differences'. The 18-year-old student's  body was found in marshland three months later. An inquest at Newport Civic Centre heard that she might have fallen from a bridge into the River Usk. Nida Naseer vanished from her parents' house in Newport, South Wales, last December after an argument over 'cultural differences' Nida Naseer's disappearance sparked a nationwide search with her sister Shamyla Naseer (left) and mother Najma Tahir (right) issuing an appeal for information . However, with no confirmed sightings after she disappeared and a post-mortem examination revealing no sign of injuries, and the circumstances surrounding her death remain a mystery. The coroner heard how Pakistan-born Miss Naseer had been a 'straight grade A student' who wanted to go to university. But because her family's asylum claim had been turned down - and they would not be able to afford her tuition fees - her degree dreams lay in tatters. Father Naseer Tahir was in the front room with his grandson on December 28 last year when his daughter suddenly got up and walked out at around 7.10pm. In a statement read aloud at the hearing, he said: 'There was a disagreement over cultural matters that evening. 'Nida was sat downstairs with me and her nephew when suddenly without warning she got up and left the room. 'As she was not wearing winter clothes or any footwear I thought she must have gone to put something in the bin outside. Nida Naseer's father Naseer Tahir told the inquest there was a 'disagreement over cultural matters' on the night of her disappearance . 'But when she did not return I became anxious.' Mortorised wheelchair user Mr Tahir, who sat through the inquest with his young grandson on his lap, then called up to Miss Naseer's sister and brother to go and look for their sibling. After his family had searched nearby streets for an hour, he went to Newport Central police station as well as the Royal Gwent Hospital in the hope of tracing her - but to no avail. 'I have had no contact with my daughter since she left the house on December 28,' he said. 'I cannot explain why she left the house. The family disagreement would not have been the reason. 'Earlier in the year she had been upset over her inability to pursue her chosen education at university. 'Her disappearance is a complete mystery.' But despite several emotional public appeals for Miss Naseer to return home, nothing was seen of her until March 27 - when a group of litter-pickers discovered a badly decomposed body on marshland four miles away from Linton Street. The coroner heard how Pakistan-born Miss Naseer (pictured) had been a 'straight grade A student' who wanted to go to university . It was later identified by dental records as being Miss Naseer. Detective Constable Stephen Francis said that, despite numerous appeals for information, no credible sightings of the teenager were ever made. He added that her disappearance had also been 'totally out of character'. Following the discovery of Miss Naseer's body, rivers and tidal expert Dr Robert Francis Allen helped police with their investigation. The inquest heard that, on the night of Ms Naseer's disappearance, the River Usk had been placed on flood alert - and the nearest access point from Linton Street was Southern Distributor Bridge. He said: 'It is not possible to determine when, where or how Miss Naseer's body ended up in the water. 'It is possible however to conclude that entry occurred into the River Usk from the vicinity of the Southern Distributor Bridge. 'The natural forces of wind, wave and tides all would have been sufficient to transport the body from start to finish.' Miss Naseer's claim for asylum was turned down, the inquest heard, meaning they would not be able to afford her tuition fees leaving her degree dreams in tatters . Pathologist Dr Richard Jones said his post-mortem examination into Miss Naseer's death had been 'hampered by decomposition'. However, he found no evidence of any injuries to her body nor anything which suggested she had been tied up or suffered a fall from a height. He said: 'It is not possible from the pathology to say how Miss Naseer died, but I have found no evidence to suggest she had been assaulted prior to her death. 'But I am not able to ascertain the medical cause of of Nida's death.' Recording an open verdict, coroner David Bowen said: 'Police investigations failed to find any evidence as to when, how or in what manner Miss Naseer’s body entered the river. 'How this happened is pure speculation. And this inquest is not concerned with speculation, it is concerned with the facts. 'Miss Naseer’s father described his daughter’s disappearance as a mystery. From the evidence that I have heard I am satisfied never has such a description been more appropriate.'","Nida Naseer left her parents' house in Newport, South Wales in December .

"The banker who inspired a character in Martin Scorsese's Wolf of Wall Street put his nightclub-inspired Tribeca townhouse on the market last Tuesday for $43.5million. Alan Wilzig, heir to his father's banking franchise, told the New York Post he paid $3,435,000 for 'an empty concrete box' that he and his wife Karin decorated. After $1.5million in renovations, the condo now features a fitness center, sauna, a full roof deck, as well as bulletproof windows and a lighting system for those that feel at home in a nightclub. Home: Alan Wilzig, a former banker, snapped up this townhome in 2005 before adding several customized design touches . The townhouse also had an attached garage that lets Wilzig zip in and out on his impressive collective of motorcycles. Though interior space is going for a whopping $5,800 per square foot, the most surprising aspect may be that Wilzig is trying to sell the townhouse without a broker by posting ads to Zillow and Facebook. 'Feel free to share this with your luxury real-estate friends for anyone interested in a Manhattan super-residence,' the post from October 7 says. Nightclub: Wilzig said he wanted to replicate the feel of a nightclub, adding a Crestron system that automates a 64-color lighting system . Mood: Lighting in the bedroom can be adjusted like the rest of the house, letter the owner choose among 64 colors . Designs: Wilzig and his wife Karin design most of the home themselves, adding design touches like alligator-wrapped handrails . Kick: The home is accessorized with several pieces from Wilzig's  collection of bikes and motorcycle memorobilia . Douglas Elliman broker Toni Haber told The Real Deal that Wilzig's price might be 'optimistic for what it is,' as the townhouse was completed with several design touches that might not fit everyone's taste. Rounding out the 7,500 square feet are alligator-wrapped banisters and a 14-foot fish tank equipped with lights that make it glow in neon colors, just like the rest of the house. 'When we set this up, I was still planning on lots of entertaining and making the house something like a nightclub,' Wilzig told the Post, though having his two children changed that. Super-dork: Wilzig complained on Facebook that Scorsese made his character look dorky next to the Wolf, Jordan Belfort, and said he wished the movie featured him driving his Ferrari Testarossa . Then and now: Wilzig put up the photo of himself with the future Mrs Belfort, claiming he went with her as 'friendly exes' to Belfort's on the night she and the real Wolf of Wall Street met, while asking for a Facebook friend to snap a photo of the scene for him . 'The reality is, we moved in here and a month later Siggi was born. So, the first time we turned the color on was to turn the house’s façade baby blue in honor of his birth. And, later, we did it in pink for Winni.' Wilzig earned much of his wealth through the Trust Company of New Jersey, a banking franchise he inherited from his father that was then acquired by North Fork Bank Corporation for over $700million in 2003. Notably, Wilzig dated Jordan Belfort's future second wife, Nadine Caridi and went with her as 'friendly exes' to the party where she first met Belfort. Video Source RTL TV  YouTube Alan Wilzig . Under the hood: The built-in garage gives Wilzig space for his large collection of automobiles and motorcycles . Kids: Wilzig and his wife moved in just before their first child, Siggi, was born, but the six bedroom home gave them plenty of room for growth when Winni was born later . Baked: The home includes a fitness center and spa, with a tanning bed to get you ready for a Jordan Belfort-style party in the Hamptons . The encounter is dramatized in the movie The Wolf of Wall Street, where Belfort flirts with Nadine (named Naomi in the film) in front of Wilzig's character. In an epic Facebook post, Wilzig attacked the movie, saying the creators 'made me a super-dork' and complained Scorsese didn't show him driving the red Ferrari Testarossa he owned at the time. Wilzig said and his family will be spending more time in their home upstate, which features a professional-grade racetrack, and hopes to find a smaller home in Manhattan if the condo sells. 'It’s time to let some hedge-fund guy who makes $40M every 6 months have it…or some Russian billionaire,' he said. Entertain: With the $43.5million condo, hosts can treat guests to a movie in the home entertainment center and customize the lighting . Designs: Wilzig and his wife Karin design most of the home themselves, adding design touches like rare blue quartz countertops in the kitchen . Toned: The home includes a fitness center and spa, with exercise machines to tone up for a Hamptons pool party . Under the hood: The built-in garage gives Wilzig space for his large collection of automobiles and motorcycles . Open air: The home has both a roof deck and an outdoor patio for soaking up what sun can filter through the surrounding high-rises .","Alan Wilzig, heir to his father's banking franchise, put his 7,500-square-feet home on the market last Tuesday .

'The desire for consumers to have access to the latest celebrity information can often make them vulnerable to cybercrime,' said Samantha Humphries-Swift, product manager at McAfee Labs. 'Most consumers do not realise the security risks they are exposing themselves to when searching for celebrity videos and images online. 'But cybercriminals can exploit this desire for breaking celebrity news, leading consumers to sites that download harmful malware on to their devices and compromise personal data.' It is thought that techniques like this - where users are enticed into clicking a link - known as 'phishing', may have formed part of the hack that had led to the posting of hundreds of nude celebrity photos on online forums. McAfee has warned that free downloads are 'by far the highest virus-prone search term', and advises people to stick to official websites, and not give out personal information when asked via email or text message.

"Inquest: Lance Corporal James Ashworth was killed by his own hand grenade when a sniper shot him as he was about to throw the device . A soldier who was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross after he died trying to rescue his comrades was killed by his own grenade, a coroner ruled today. Lance Corporal James Ashworth, 23, of 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards, was fatally injured by his own grenade after he was hit by a Taliban bullet just as he went to throw the explosive device into a compound in June last year. At L/Cpl Ashworth’s inquest today Anne Pember, the Northamptonshire Coroner, said a post mortem had revealed cause of death as blast injuries caused by an explosion and recorded a verdict of unlawful killing while he was serving on operations in Afghanistan. His bravery persuaded senior officers to recommend the soldier - known by his friends as a 'gentle giant' - for the VC. The award stated: 'Despite the ferocity of the insurgent's resistance, Ashworth refused to be beaten. 'His total disregard for his own safety in ensuring that the last grenade was posted accurately was the gallant last action of a soldier who had willingly placed himself in the line of fire on numerous occasions earlier in the attack. 'This supremely courageous and inspiring action deserves the highest recognition.' The VC has been awarded just ten times to UK soldiers since the Second World War. The posthumous honour to L/Cpl Ashworth, of the 1st Battalion the Grenadier Guards, is just the second from the 12-year conflict in Afghanistan. The inquest heard how L/Cpl Ashworth died after crawling along the ground while being peppered with bullets to throw his last grenade at a sniper who had his team pinned down. Mourning: The family of British soldier Lance Corporal James Ashworth, mother Kerry Ashworth, father former Grenadier Guardsman Duane Ashworth (left) and brother and British soldier Coran Ashworth (right) Speaking after the inquest in . Kettering, his mother Kerry said her son, only the second soldier to be . awarded a VC for bravery in Afghanistan, had died doing the job he . loved. She said: 'His smile can light up any room he goes into and we all love and miss him so. 'James . passed away doing a job he loved. At times it was a hard job but he did . get to experience new countries, learn new skills and make some . wonderful friends. 'James will be forever be in our hearts, thoughts and prayers and we will never get over his passing. 'But . we will stay strong together as a family and along with his friends we . will remain positive and celebrate his life at every opportunity as I . know that is what he would want us to do.' His commanding officer Lieutenant-Colonel James Bowder said he was 'the bravest of soldiers, the best of men'. As well as the VC, L/Cpl Ashworth has had a square named after him in his home town of Corby. The coroner heard sometimes emotional testimony from comrades fighting alongside L/Cpl Ashworth on the day he died. His platoon commander Captain Michael Dobbin described how an operation had been ordered to 'kill or capture' a skilled Taliban sniper team which had shot and wounded three British soldiers in the preceding days. Proud: Mrs Ashworth and son Coran  receiving the Victoria Cross conferred on her late son . After four days planning, the . insurgents were spotted near a village in the Nahr-e-Saraj area of . Helmand province, and the strike team, including L/Cpl Ashworth, swooped . on the area in two helicopters. Capt . Dobbin said that with heavy fighting taking place elsewhere on the . outskirts of the village, the compound 'had to be cleared'. He . said a number of options were ruled out before L/Cpl Ashworth . volunteered to try to 'post a grenade' into the room where the insurgent . was hiding . Capt Dobbin said there was no chance of help from a combat helicopter supporting the operation, or any point using a portable rocket launcher because his own men would be caught in the resulting blasts. Using grenade launchers was also ruled out because trees near the doorway of the Taliban fighter’s position were blocking their line of sight. 'L/Cpl Ashworth suggested that if he moved along a low wall, he would be out of line of sight,' said Capt Dobbin. 'He was confident he could get the grenade in the doorway, allowing me and Capt Davis to assault the position.'Across the compound, L/Cpl Wint saw his friend 'Ash' 'crawling along the wall on his belt buckle'. As L/Cpl Ashworth got near the . doorway, covered by the low wall, L/Cpl Wint saw bullets pepper the . ground inches from his friend and he called out 'Ash, get out of there'. Tribute: The repatriation ceremony for Lance Corporal James Ashworth after he died in Afghanistan last June . Lance Corporal Ashworth (left), was awarded the Victoria Cross in recognition of his 'extraordinary courage' Still . under fire from the insurgent, he said L/Cpl Ashworth 'did not . respond'. There was an explosion, throwing up a cloud of dust, with . L/Cpl Wint initially thinking his friend had triggered an improvised . explosive device. Capt Dobbin, waiting a few yards away, said both he and Capt Davis were surprised when they realised the explosion had gone off by L/Cpl Ashworth’s position. 'In the space of about two seconds we heard a cry of warning, then the rounds came in, then an enormous explosion,' he said. He said there were 'no signs of life' from L/Cpl Ashworth. The insurgent was killed some minutes later when he was flushed out with grenades and shot. Award: Lance Corporal Ashworth was given a posthumous Victoria Cross. It is the UK's highest gallantry medal . L/Cpl Ashworth was airlifted and pronounced dead on arrival at the field hospital at Camp Bastion. A post-mortem examination revealed numerous 'blast fragment wounds' to his head and body, with forensic pathologist Dr Nicolas Hunt stating he 'would not expect him to survive' the wounds sustained. He added that there would have been 'virtually instantaneous loss of consciousness'. Dr Hunt also noted bruising to the heart caused by the blunt trauma of a bullet impacting on the soldier’s body armour. Alan Hepper, an expert on the Osprey body armour British soldiers wear into battle, said the protective plate at the front of L/Cpl Ashworth’s vest had been fractured by a bullet, but it failed to penetrate. The bullet was of the calibre fired from AK47-type weapons favoured by the Taliban. Mrs Pember, giving her verdict, said: 'James bravely volunteered to throw the last grenade. 'He crouched down by a wall and sadly his body armour was struck by a single gunshot which knocked him to the ground. 'The grenade he had was already primed and detonated next to him.' She added he was 'one of only 10 soldiers to receive the highest honour for gallantry since the Second World War'. Unique: The Victoria Cross medal is cast from the metal of Russian guns captured during the Crimean War . The Victoria Cross ranks as the nation's highest award for gallantry, along with the George Cross. Instituted . by Queen Victoria in 1856, the Victoria Cross is awarded for 'most . conspicuous bravery, or some daring or pre-eminent act of valour or . self-sacrifice, or extreme devotion to duty in the presence of the . enemy.' It is hand-made from bronze cannon captured from the Russians at . the siege of Sevastopol in 1854-55 during the Crimean War. The . bronze cross, which has a crimson ribbon bears the inscription 'For . Valour', is cast from the metal of Russian guns captured at the siege of . Sevastopol during the Crimean War, the campaign in which the first . medals were awarded. The . Victoria Cross may be awarded to all ranks of the services - and also . to civilians - to recognise gallantry in the presence of the enemy. The . medal has been awarded 1,356 times, the most recent of which was a . posthumous award to Corporal Bryan Budd, of the 3rd Battalion The . Parachute Regiment, for acts of ""inspirational leadership and the . greatest valour"" in southern Afghanistan in 2006. Only . 13 Victoria Cross medals have been awarded since the Second World War, . nine to members of the British Army and four to the Australian Army. L/Cpl Ashworth's is just the fifth to have been awarded since the Falklands conflict, and all but one have been posthumous. Private . Johnson Beharry, from 1st Battalion the Princess of Wales's Royal . Regiment, was awarded the honour for two separate acts of outstanding . gallantry to rescue his comrades in Iraq in 2004, during which suffered . serious head injuries. The . Victoria Cross has been awarded to the same person twice on three . occasions - to doctors Captain Arthur Martin-Leake (1902 and 1914) and . Captain Noel Chavasse (1916 and posthumously 1917), and New Zealander . Captain Charles Upham (1941 and 1942). The . George Cross, which stands equal to the Victoria Cross as an award, . recognises acts of gallantry by members of the Armed Forces or civilians . in situations for which the Victoria Cross is not appropriate. These can be incidents that are not in the presence of the enemy, such as bomb or mine disposal.","Lance Corporal James Ashworth, 23, volunteered to throw his last grenade at Taliban sniper near the Nahr-e-Saraj area of Helmand province .

"The heir to Camelot gallantly hand-delivered the Profile in Courage award to George H. W. Bush at his home in Kennebunkport on Monday. John Schlossberg, a 21-year-old senior at Yale, was thoughtful enough to also bring a pair of socks printed with the silhouette of his grandfather JFK. The Profile in Courage honor recognized former President Bush's willingness to compromise with Democrats on a tax deal in 1990 after pledging to voters he would not raise taxes. Scroll down for video . Honor: John Schlossberg, 21, JFK's grandson, presents George H. W. Bush the Profile in Courage award at the former president's home in Kennebunkport, Maine . 'America’s gain was President Bush’s loss,' the Boston Globe reports Schlossberg said of the tax compromise, which helped bridge a gap in the federal deficit and eased political deadlock. 'His decision to put country above party and political prospects make him an example of a modern profile in courage that is all too rare,' Schlossberg added. George H. W. Bush was unable to make the ceremony at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in May, so Lauren Bush accepted the honor on her grandfather's behalf. 'At age 89 and 7/8, let me assure you kind words really do matter,' read a statement from former President Bush. 'Thank you again for remembering what our team tried to do, lo, those many years ago.' The son of Caroline Kennedy, Schlossberg is JFK's only grandson, and has in recent years taking the responsibility for speaking for the family at events such as the 50th anniversary of JFK Airport in New York. He's also attracted attention for his looks. During his mother's swearing in ceremony as ambassador to Japan, a Twitter user gushed, 'When did Caroline Kennedy's son become such a 10?'

Another admired fantasized, 'I can't wait to marry into the Kennedy family.' As for the bipartisan sock gift, former President Bush calls himself a 'self-proclaimed sock man' according to Esquire. 'I don't know what your guilty pleasures are in life, but one of mine is socks,' Bush wrote in a Republican National Committee email offering a pair of monogrammed socks in exchange for donations.

"A senior Labor frontbencher has broken ranks and says new anti-terror laws that allow journalists  to be jailed for reporting on intelligence operations might have overstepped the mark. Tony Abbott's Parliament beefed up the domestic spy agency ASIO's powers earlier this month. Journalists will face 10 years in jail if they reveal details of intelligence operations.

Tony Abbott and Parliament beefed up Australia's terror laws this month . Mr Albanese has now hit out at the lack of scrutiny over the measures, describing the penalties on the media as draconian. The party's spokesperson on Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, said there was public interest in exposing errors of security agencies. 'You can be fully supportive of our engagement in the Middle East and still say we don't protect freedom by giving it up,' Mr Albanese told Sky News. Lobor backbencher Melissa Parke was the lone voice of dissent in Parliament when the new laws went through . 'I'm concerned about the rights of journalists.' Mr Albanese's concerns may be too little too late. Labor waved the bill through parliament, citing bipartisan support for national security, and backbencher Melissa Parke was the lone voice of dissent. Mr Albanese said he was speaking for himself and not Oppostion Leader Bill Shorten in his comments . Asked if Opposition Leader Bill Shorten shared his concerns about press freedom, Mr Albanese said: 'I'm speaking for myself. 'Sometimes things might have gone too far. If that is the case they should be wound back.' The second tranche of anti-terror laws cracking down on Australians who go overseas to fight alongside extremists will be debated in parliament in mid-October. 'We should be arguing for more scrutiny of these issues,' Mr Albanese said.

"Australians are claiming to take more sexual partners over a lifetime than a decade ago, with researchers pointing towards a liberal approach to sleeping with people. Compared to a decade ago, people have become more open to premarital sex, abortion and homosexuality, liberating couples to engage in a varied sex life. Researchers from the University of New South Wales (UNSW), La Trobe University and the University of Sydney have published a study which reveals that women claim to have taken nine sexual partners in their lifetime, and men claim to have taken 17.5. Scroll down for video . Compared to a decade ago, people have become more open to premarital sex, abortion and homosexuality, liberating couples to engage in a varied sex life . Compared to a decade ago, people have become more open to premarital sex, abortion and homosexuality, liberating couples to engage in a varied sex life . Around 20,000 people aged between 16 and 69 participated in the researcher, revealing statistics that are higher than numbers from a decade ago. The last report indicated that women took 7 partners over a lifetime, and men took 16.5 partners over a lifetime. 'It might be that there's a more liberal approach to actually having more partners,' said Dr Chris Rissel, public health researcher at the University of Sydney told The Sydney Morning Herald. 'The unacceptability of women being promiscuous is slipping away.' The study indicated that women are also more likely to have had sex for the first time during their early teens, with 16% of women reporting that they had lost their virginity before 16, up from 13% a decade ago. However, less men reported engaging in sex before the age of 16, down from 22% a decade ago to 19%. Research also revealed that on average Australians were having sex approximately 1.4 times a week, less than 0.4 times than Australians a decade ago. The younger they were, the more sex they were having but even people in their 60s admitted to engaging in the practice at least once a week. Professor Juliet Richters, lead researcher from UNSW, said that the frequency of sex among those surveyed came as a shock. 'We thought it was a mistake, but a recent British national survey had the same finding,' Professor Richters told The Age. With technology taking over our daily routine, Professor Richters suggests the time spent online could be impacting our sex lives. 'I would have thought take a mobile phone to bed might have something to do with it', she said. With technology taking over our daily routine, Professor Juliet Richters from UNSW suggests the time spent  online could be impacting our sex lives . Even though people these days are having less sex, nearly 90 per cent of men and 75 per cent of women admit that they are very much enjoying their sexual encounters. The country's largest study of sexual activity and attitudes  found that over 92 per cent of heterosexual people are having vaginal sex, 86 per cent of men and 80 per cent of women are engaging in oral sex and 25 per cent of men and 19 per cent of women have had anal sex. Oral and anal sex was more common among 30 to 49 year-olds. 'We're entering a more exploratory, diverse time,' said Dr Chris Rissel. 'I think what we've probably got is a less dramatic change than the 1960s but across a wider range of the population. We've got more exploration, more diversity, across a wider age group.' Nearly half of the people under 60 also admitted to watching pornography compared to a decade ago. Despite this, around 95 per cent of people demand exclusivity in their relationship, The Australian Study of Health and Reproduction revealed.

"A man who sparked an Ebola scare on board a flight from Milan to Dublin has been spared a criminal record and ordered to donate £2,000 to charity. Fifty-six-year old Roberto Binaschi was arrested on Thursday, along with two women, after making a sick joke about the worldwide epidemic. The trio were taken to Ballymun Garda station. A member of the cabin crew, on clearing away rubbish, was alarmed to find the words 'Attenzione Ebola' on the lid of a coffee cup, and it was discovered that Binaschi had written it while sharing 'a joke' with his daughter.

An Aer Lingus flight from Milan to Dublin was placed under emergency lockdown after Mr Binaschi's actions . After the air steward notified the captain and the Airbus A320 was put under emergency lockdown when it landed at Dublin Airport as medics were called to the scene. Binaschi, from Corso Argentina, Vigeavano, near Milan, was held overnight and brought before Dublin District Court on Friday morning. The two women were released without charge. He admitted engaging in threatening, abusive, or insulting behaviour on an aeroplane contrary to the Air Navigation and Transport Act. He made no further comment on the case, but judge Anthony Halpin called the incident 'a sick joke' and in light of the seriousness of Ebola, likened it to a bomb threat. The judge accepted the apologetic nature of the Italian man, and ordered him to pay €2,500 which converts to around £2,000. IT company director Mr Binaschi was travelling to Ireland with his family to attend a conference. Cabin crew discovered a coffee cup with the words ‘Attenzione Ebola’ written on it . Around 150 passengers and crew were forced to remain isolated on board flight EI433 on the runway apron for an hour while three of the passengers were medically examined. Airport police placed a cordon at the aircraft, which was parked at a stand.

"A devoted boyfriend spent months building his girlfriend a beautiful customized armoire for her jewelry - and then popped the question after hiding an engagement ring inside it.

'Make me the happiest guy in the world': The bride-to-be was so overcome with emotion that she could only nod her 'yes' to her kneeling fiance . His stunned bride-to-be was overwhelmed with the overly-generous gesture and - surrounded by her family and friends - eagerly began exploring the armoire, exclaiming with joy when she found a variety of her favorite things, including gluten free brownie mix, rice krispie treats and a pumpkin spice candle, secreted away in each of the drawers. It was in the very bottom of the elaborately-designed furniture that the real surprise lay in wait however. After Carly had unearthed a treasure trove of sweet treats, Blake suggested that she take another look in the Twix-filled bottom drawer, saying: 'I don't think you looked in that drawer hard enough. 'You've got to dig around a little bit.' It didn't take long for Carly to uncover a small wooden box hidden among her favorite chocolate bars, which she opened to reveal a stunning diamond ring.

'I just got really emotional because he put so much thought and work into it,' Carly told Today.com. 'He was so considerate in taking into account what I actually needed and might like.' Hidden treasure: Blake hid the ring among a stash of Twix bars, which are one of Carly's favorite chocolates . The heartwarming moment was captured on camera by Carly's mother - and posted to YouTube the day after the proposal, where it has quickly amassed more than 630,000 views. 'I was so thankful they were videotaping it because I really don’t remember from opening the box until five minutes later,' Carly added. 'We just put it up because we knew our family would want to see it. If our friends wanted to watch it, that was cool. 'But we had never thought it would do anything like this.' Better than shoe boxes: Blake wanted his fiancee to have something nicer in which to store all her jewelry . 'Start at the top...' Carly's future husband told her to open each drawer of the armoire to check what was hidden inside . The couple are both currently in their last year of college - Carly, 22, is spending the year doing clinical lab work at a Kansas City hospital, while 21-year-old Blake is studying at a school about two hours away in Pittsburg, Kansas - and are due to finish up their courses in May. And it looks as though Blake will have plenty to occupy his free time after he graduates; the skilled carpenter has already received a number of armoire requests from viewers of the YouTube video eager to get their hands on one of his custom pieces.

"Drug addict David Dempsey was found guilty of murder and ordered to serve a minimum of 30 years in prison . A drug addict who robbed and stabbed to death a grieving widower in his own home after the victim refused to buy a stolen watch was jailed for life today. David Dempsey, 43, knifed 62-year old Steven Butterworth four times after wedging his foot in the front door to stop the older man closing it. He then stole Mr Butterworth's wallet containing £400 before leaving him to die. Mr Butterworth's wife of 36 years had died only two months before the stabbing. He never recovered and died in hospital four weeks later. Police discovered that Dempsey from Astley, near Wigan, Greater Manchester had been pestering Mr Butterworth with stolen goods including a haul of meat. At Liverpool Crown Court today he was found guilty of murder following a retrial and ordered to serve a minimum of 30 years in prison. The court heard that the killer took advantage of Mr Butterworth when he was in mourning for his wife, Mary, who died in June last year aged 58. Dempsey was looking for money to buy drugs and would steal food from shops to sell on the black market. He offered the stolen meat for sale to Mr Butteworth on various occasions but tragedy struck on August 23 last year when Dempsey turned up on the victim's doorstep with a stolen watch and offered to sell it. Mr Butterworth agreed to let Dempsey leave the watch with him and then went out for the afternoon during which he told his niece and a friend he was 'having trouble' with someone who had been to the house trying to sell him a watch. At around 5.20pm, Mr Butterworth returned home and shortly afterwards Dempsey came to the door. Witnesses said Dempsey was seen to put his foot in the door to prevent the door being closed and then walk into the house pushing Mr Butterworth backwards. Tragic couple: Steven Butterworth (left) died a month after being stabbed in his own home and his wife Mary (right) who died two months before her husband was attacked . Once inside he stabbed Mr Butterworth, twice in the front and twice in his back, before stealing the wallet. Mr Butterworth called his niece and told her he had been stabbed before dialling 999. She rushed over to find him bleeding and the ambulance brigade and police arrived shortly afterwards. He told paramedics that someone had pushed their way into the house and stabbed him after stealing his wallet – which contained cash, credit cards and driving licence – but that he did not want to make a statement. The Butterworths' home in Leigh where Steve Butterworth was stabbed by a drug addict who wanted to sell him stolen property . His niece went with her uncle to the hospital and when she asked who stabbed him he replied: 'It's that man who came round about the watch earlier today'.' Mr Butterworth was taken to hospital for treatment of four stab wounds and a collapsed lung but he died on September 27. After the stabbing Dempsey went to his dealer to buy heroin and crack cocaine and was seen to be very pale and sweaty. The unnamed dealer told the jury: 'He said he had stabbed someone. I didn't believe him at first. A lot of people say a lot of things and it goes in one ear and out the other. 'But then I thought how he had approached me looking pale and sweaty. He didn't tell me who he had stabbed. 'I found it hard to deal with. I just knew someone has died and I knew he had done it'. In a statement, Mr Butterworth's family said: 'Steve was a gentle and caring dad, granddad, brother and uncle. He was also a keen fisherman and friendly neighbour. 'Sadly, Steve recently became a widower when his wife of 36 years died unexpectedly and whilst grieving and struggling to come to terms with his loss, he was targeted and brutally attacked and robbed in his own home.'","David Dempsey, 43, knifed Steven Butterworth four times after forcing his way in at home in Leigh .

"It's a mystery that has confounded military experts around the world for years. The top-secret X-37B space drone, which landed in California on Friday, has spent nearly two years orbiting Earth on a classified mission. Theories have ranged from it being a space bomber ready to attack in a matter of hours, to a clandestine probe on a mission to 'take out' spy satellites. Scroll down for video . The mystery spacecraft, which some say could be being used for spying, has landed at the  Vandenberg Air Force Base in California after almost to years in orbit . One leading secrecy expert told MailOnline that the drone is 'very likely' to be a US spy plane. 'The US government has a bottomless appetite for sensitive information,' said Steven Aftergood, a secrecy expert at the Federation of American Scientists. 'As powerful as our intelligence satellites may be, they also have their limitations - most notably the limitations imposed by their orbital parameters. 'It's conceivable that a spy plane would introduce new versatility into overhead reconnaissance. 'The usual suspects would be targets. For instance, Iran or North Korea, or the various battle zones in the Middle East and elsewhere.' An infrared view of the X-37B unmanned spacecraft landing at Vandenberg Air Force Base.  The purpose of the U.S. military's space plane is classified, only fueling speculation about why it has been orbiting Earth for nearly two years on this, its third mission . One leading secrecy expert has told MailOnline that the drone (artist's impression pictured) is 'very likely' to be a US spy plane. Earlier this year, the editor of Spaceflight magazine claimed the space plane was spying on the Chinese space station . Earlier this year, the editor of Spaceflight magazine claimed the space plane was spying on the Chinese space station, arguing that the orbit of the X-37B was close to that of the Tiangong centre. The U.S. Air Force's unmanned X-37B space plane has flown three secret missions to date. Each time it has carried a mystery payload on long-duration flights in Earth orbit. The spacecraft looks similar to Nasa's space shuttle but is much smaller. The X-37B is about 29ft (8.8m) long and 9.5ft (2.9 m) tall. It has a wingspan of just less than 15ft (4.6 m). At launch, it weighs 11,000lbs (4,990kg). The craft is taken into orbit on a rocket but lands like the space shuttle by gliding down to Earth. But Brian Weeden,  a former Air Force officer who worked at U.S. Strategic Command's Joint Space Operations Center, pointed out that X-37B couldn't keep a constant eye on the Chinese space station. 'Even though there may be a brief chance at some point for the X-37B to collect intelligence [on the Chinese space station], that certainly is not the main mission, or even something all that feasible,' said. Other theories sound straight out of a James Bond film, including that the spacecraft would be able to capture the satellites of other nations. A space bomber that can attack anywhere in the world within a matter of hours has also been put forward by conspiracy theorists. 'Of all the possibilities, that strikes me as probably the least likely because it's the least necessary,' said Mr Aftergood. 'The US military has global reach without it.' The X-37B space drone, otherwise known as the Orbital Test Vehicle, has been in flight since December 2012 on a secret mission. Like a shuttle, X-37B is blasted into orbit by a rocket. However, it lands using a runway like a normal aircraft. The X-37B is too small to carry people onboard, but does have a cargo bay similar to that of a pickup truck, which is just large enough to carry a small satellite . The space plane is a spy plane: The leading theory appears to be that the unmanned space plane is a shuttle-shaped surveillance vehicle. It could be a space bomber: This is the least likely theory, according tot Seven Aftergood, a secrecy expert at the Federation of American Scientists. He claims the US doesn't need this capability. It is on a mission is to 'take out' satellites: This activity would be easily traceable, making it unlikely to stay a secret. The X-37B deploys spy satellites: Instead of destroying them, the theory suggests that the space plane's orbit matches up to where deployed satellites would work best for spying on other countries. The X-program has bounced between several federal agencies, Nasa among them, since 1999. The plane has been in space for a total of 674 days, far more than its two previous flights which lasted 225 and 469 days. The program's first mission launched in April 2010 and landed in December that year. The second space plane took off on March 2011 and came back to Earth in June 2012. According to X-37B manufacturer Boeing, the space plane operates in low-earth orbit, between 110 and 500 miles above earth. By comparison, the International Space Station orbits at about 220 miles. Both top secret missions ended at Vandenberg base, but this may soon change as Boeing, which built the shuttles, is working to renovate a Nasa hangar at the Kennedy Space Centre, which could become X-37B's new home. This December 3, 2010, file image provided by the Vandenberg Air Force Base shows technicians examining the X-37B unmanned spaceplane shortly after landing at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California . Nasa last week said it has entered into an agreement with the Air Force's X-37B program for use of the Kennedy Space Center's Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF) Bays 1 and 2 - former space shuttle hangars. Boeing is performing construction upgrades in those facilities that are targeted to be complete in December. All missions so far have launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. While the airplane looks like Nasa's retired space shuttles, it has its own identity. Like a shuttle, it is blasted into orbit by a rocket. However, it lands using a runway like a normal aircraft. The X-37B is too small to carry people onboard, but does have a cargo bay similar to that of a pickup truck, which is just large enough to carry a small satellite. 'It's misleading, the idea that secret programmes like this have achieved important technological breakthroughs – it's a seductive idea but misleading,' Mr Aftergood told MailOnline. 'Based on experience of past programmes, this craft has gone far beyond the secret programme stage, it's existence is now an acknowledged fact, . 'Some sort of explanation of its function is likely to come, if not this year, then I guess within five years.'","Craft has been in space for 674 days and returned to California on Friday .

"An aspiring Florida model returning from a trip to Jamaica has been arrested for allegedly hiding a stash of cocaine in her vagina. KathyAnn Ferguson, 26, from Hollywood, was taken into custody Sunday at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and charged with cocaine trafficking. The traveler flew in aboard JetBlue Flight 2316 from Montego Bay, Jamaica, at around 4.15pm, according to her arrest affidavit. Stash: KathyAnn Ferguson, 26, was arrested Sunday at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and charged with transporting cocaine hidden inside her privates . The 5-foot-7, 175-pound woman was subjected to a security search, during which she admitted to a US Customs and Border Protection officer that she had a 'package' crammed inside her privates. After being taken into custody, Ms Ferguson removed the container from her body herself; the powdery substance inside tested positive for cocaine. According to the affidavit obtained by Sun-Sentinel, Ferguson was transporting 172 grams of the drug, or about 6 ounces. Ferguson was then taken to an area hospital to receive medical attention before she was booked into the Broward County Main Jail. She has since been released on $15,000 bond. Nabbed: Ferguson was picked up by TSA after getting off a JetBlue flight from Jamaica . Checkered past: Ferguson, an aspiring model and actress, has a long criminal history . This is not the first time the aspiring actress and model has run afoul of the law. According to online records, in 2009 then-21-year-old KathyAnn Ferguson was arrested on a battery charge.

"The head of the UN has described the destruction of Gaza as 'beyond description' as he visited the city today following the war between Israel and Palestine this summer. Ban Ki-Moon was shown entire neighbourhoods of Gaza which were flattened during bombing by Israel, just as efforts at rebuilding the city got underway. Ban was also shown Hamas tunnels used to attack Israeli soldiers, calling them 'shocking', and adding that Israeli citizens should not have to live under the threat of missile strikes. Scroll down for video . Ban Ki-Moon visited Gaza today as efforts to rebuild the city began, describing the devastation as 'beyond description', and was also shown Hamas tunnels used to attack Israeli troops . The conflict this summer killed an estimated 2,100 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and another 72 Israelis after tensions in the volatile Middle Eastern region spilled over. Ban said the destruction he saw in Gaza was 'much more serious' than what he witnessed in the Palestinian territory in 2009 in the aftermath of a previous Israel-Hamas war. Ban said the tunnels were 'shocking' adding that Israelis should not have to live under the threat of Hamas missile strikes . The UN leader said he came to the territory with 'a heavy heart' and told Israeli and Palestinian officials  that 'there is no hope for the long-term stability of Gaza without addressing the underlying causes of the conflict.' Two months after the war ended in a stalemate, border restrictions remain largely in place, but today marked the arrival of the first construction materials allowed through Israel's blockade. Israel has agreed to a UN-monitored system to allow the entry of construction materials, and over the weekend the international community pledged $2.7 billion in reconstruction aid. Israel, which controls the main cargo crossing into Gaza, called Tuesday's effort a 'pilot' initiative, still wary that building materials could be used by Hamas to rebuild its military infrastructure. The UN is monitoring the use of construction materials that pass through the Israeli border crossing, to ensure the materials are not diverted for Hamas military purposes. Raed Fattouh, the Palestinian Authority coordinator for goods imports to Gaza, said 75 trucks of cement, aggregates and metal supplies were entering Gaza - double the daily average in 2013. In another move aimed at reconciliation, the Israeli army said it will allow Gaza farmers to sell produce to the West Bank for the first time since Hamas took over Gaza in 2007. The export ban was one of the most painful restrictions crippling Gaza's economy, because the West Bank used to be the tiny coastal territory's main export market. In a sign of growing international support for the Palestinians, Ban met with ministers of the new Palestinian unity government in Gaza. Learning curve: During his visit, Ban also visited schools that are being run by the UN as part of a relief effort  to help support the thousands left homeless by Israel's bombing campaign this summer . Ban  talks to Palestinian Mohammed Abed al-Dayem who was wounded in Israeli attacks on Gaza . Peace: Ban used the visit to appeal to both sides to address the underlying reasons for the conflict in order to prevent it from happening again . Though Israel has denounced the Palestinian government because it is backed by Hamas, Western governments have signaled a willingness to work with it. Later, Ban also visited southern Israeli communities that have been battered by years of Gaza rocket fire and consoled the family of a 4-year-old boy killed during the war. The military also gave him a tour of the one of the underground tunnels that Hamas built to attack Israeli civilians - the discovery of which prompted Israel's ground invasion in Gaza. UN vehicles are seen parked outside a school while Ban Ki-Moon visited while in Gaza today . Flattened: Whole neighbourhoods in Gaza were destroyed during Israeli bombing this summer in a conflict which left 2,100 Palestinians dead . On the mend: Rebuilding efforts began in Gaza today after the first shipment of construction materials were allowed through by the Israeli blockade . Ban's visit came amid fresh waves of criticism of Israeli policies as Britain's parliament voted Monday to recognise an independent Palestinian state. While the Prime Minister abstained , and half of MPs did not vote, the symbolic gesture was designed to send a message to Israel about its approach in Gaza. The vote should have no tangible effect on British foreign policy. But Britain's ambassador to Israel warned it symbolizes a trend that should worry the Jewish state. Healing: Israel has also lifted a ban on Gazan farmers selling produce on the west bank which they have not been allowed to do since Hamas took control of the city in 2007 . Rebuilding: While Israel are fearful that building materials will be diverted by Hamas to rebuild military infrastructure, they have agreed to allow in cement and metal under UN supervision . Change: Israel's slackening of import and export rules around Gaza reflect a wider global political change towards sympathy with Palestine following the conflict this summer .","Ban said destruction of Gaza is 'much more serious' than in 2009 conflict .

"Despite it being perceived as posh, the Queen's English has been named Britain's favourite accent . It is the unmistakable sound of the Queen and old BBC newsreels. And despite being perceived as a little posh, received pronunciation (RP) is still our favourite accent. For a survey has found that the Queen's English is most associated with nine out of ten positive character traits, including attractiveness, intelligence, honesty, charm, sophistication and reliability. The only category where it falls short is in humour where it came only eleventh with the Geordie lilt sounding most fun ahead of Liverpudlian, Irish, Cornish and Essex. The  eHarmony.co.uk experiment involving 750 participants listening to sound clips of men and women with 19 different international and regional accents and scoring what they believed of the person based on 10 character traits. The poll also identified a phenomenon dubbed the 'Cheryl Cole factor' where celebrities shape our preconceptions about accents. Despite the reputation of French and Italian men, RP is the real language of love - as well as many other things. Edinburgh came second overall ahead of Australian, southern Irish, Yorkshire and American. They were followed by Geordie, Mancunian, Glaswegian and Welsh. French was ranked only 16th for attractiveness and Italian came in only slightly higher at 13th. French performed better in the 'romantic' category but was still only placed third behind RP and Edinburgh. More than one-in-five (22 per cent) admitted the allure of some accents is so strong they have actually gone on a date because of it - and seven percent have 'played up' how they speak because they believed it sounded attractive. Professor Jane Setter, a phoneticist at Reading University, said: 'RP speakers have been rated highly in terms of intelligence - and the accent itself as attractive - since studies like this began. 'Actors with this accent - like Patrick Stewart (Star Trek: The Next Generation), Michelle Dockery (Downton Abbey) and Richard E. Grant (Withnail and I) - come over as urbane, charming, witty and educated and - well - wouldn't everyone want that from a prospective romantic partner? 'The Edinburgh accent is also associated with culture and intelligence - think Sean Connery or David Tennant and you're already swept off your feet. The Edinburgh accent, widely associated with actor Sean Connery, is considered romantic and charming . The poll also identified a phenomenon dubbed the 'Cheryl Cole factor', in which celebrities shape our preconceptions about accents . 'However, comedians are rarely RP speakers and so it is no surprise to see it rated less highly in that respect; Sarah Millican (Geordie) and John Bishop (Liverpool) spring to mind as wonderfully funny, articulate people. 'Our preconceptions and love of certain lilts, drawls and tones when it comes to accents is mostly down to experience and stereotyping. 1. Received pronunciation (RP) 2. Edinburgh . 3. Australian . 4. Irish (Republic of Ireland) 5. Yorkshire . 6. American . 7. Geordie . 8. Mancunian . 9. Glaswegian . 10. Welsh . 'This helps to explain why RP scores so highly across all categories - it's the accent we associate with trusted newsreaders plus it continues to be used as the model for teaching English as a foreign language. 'In terms of other accents which were rated highly for attractiveness - again stereotyping is at play. Across the pond we see Americans as colourful and international so they're 'interesting', Yorkshire folk are seen as down to earth and honest and the Irish have 'kissed the Blarney stone' and are celebrated as charming and quick witted. 'In terms of French and Italian not faring so well this could simply be down to a lack of familiarity with their unique inflections.' Jemima Wade, spokesperson for eHarmony.co.uk, said: 'After spending time getting to know each other online the first time you meet and say 'hello' on a date is a special, exciting moment. 'Yet while accents may be appealing at first - sparking initial interest and attraction - happy long-term relationships are about far more than that.'","Received pronunciation named Britain's favourite accent in new survey .

"A drug dealer has been jailed after police found Class A drugs stashed inside children's Kinder Surprise eggs at his home . Police discovered 30-year-old Warren Christopher had concealed a large amount of the illegal class-A drugs inside the plastic containers that come with the children's treat. Christopher was also found to have a gun and ammunition at his home in Epsom, Surrey during a raid in August. Drug dealer Warren Christopher (left) hid heroin and crack cocaine in the containers which come with children's Kinder Surprise eggs (right, file photo) He is now beginning a five-year prison sentence, after pleading guilty to seven drug and firearm offences, all committed which all breached a suspended sentence. Officers searching his home found a number of drug wraps stuffed inside the yellow containers that hold the prizes contained inside the beloved children's chocolate egg. More wraps were found in his bedroom as well as a handgun concealed in a sock, a large quantity of cash and ammunition. The raid took place after police were tipped off by a suspicious local. Investigating officer Detective Constable Hannah Millyard said: 'This sentence demonstrates that when members of the public come forward with their concerns about illegal activity in their community, we will act. 'Drugs have a hugely damaging impact on people who use them and in turn on the neighbourhoods where they are used, with their use often leading to other criminal behaviour.' Christopher was sentenced at Guildford Crown Court on Monday, after admitting two counts of possessing a class A drug with intent to supply, possessing a firearm without a certificate, and possessing a firearm when prohibited.

Scroll down for video . The pencil sketches show George Lucas' idea about how Luke Skywalker was going to destroy the Death Star . The detailed sketches show exactly the shots Lucas wanted in the final movie . The final film is remarkably faithful to the elements on the story board in many of the key scenes . Also for sale were sketches of the famous lightsaber battle in which Darth Vader tells Luke that he is his father after chopping off his hand. Skywalker then voluntarily jumped down an air shaft rather than be persuaded the join the dark side at the climax of the second film. The images were used during the making of the films to put together storyboards and to help the set designers create the real life props. The drawings from the first film were done by artist Joe Johnston, who went on to become a film director in his own right with credits including Jurassic Park III, Jumangi and Hidalgo. It is not known who drew the sketches from the two follow-up films. They were sold individually to private collectors in a sale held by Californian auction house Profiles in History. In the same auction an original edition of the first ever Star Wars poster expected to sell for $800 went for almost $4,000. The moment shows the moment Darth Vader engages in a lightsaber duel with Luke Skywalker in Cloud City . This sketch is the moment Luke falls down an air shaft in Cloud City after Darth Vader chops off his hand . Interestingly for a US film, Luke Skywalker's landspeeder is right-hand drive . Joe Maddalena, from Profiles in History, said: 'Star Wars was George Lucas's baby and so he was very involved in the design process. The artists got closer and closer to his vision and when he approved the drawings they literally were made in real life. 'Once they had the vision on paper it came true on film. 'At the time these artists were just doing their jobs - they weren't thinking that this film would become one of the most iconic ever made. 'But now we know these storyboards were the beginnings of some of the greatest movie scenes of all time. 'It's amazing to see their humble beginnings. 'What's amazing about these preliminary sketches is just how close they are to the finished product. 'A lot of this stuff has come directly from people who worked on the films and took their sketches home once the production was done. 'These were drawn in the days before movie memorabilia was big so it's amazing they've survived all this time.'

"In Joe Cross's own words, six years a go he 'looked like I'd swallowed a sheep.' The Australian was 'fat, sick and nearly dead' - he weighed 22 stone and was suffering from a debilitating autoimmune disease that meant he was constantly dosed up on drugs. His daily diet consisted of pizza, pies and doughnuts - leaving him low on energy and on a fast track to an early grave. Scroll down for video . Juice convert: Joe Cross overhauled his diet and only drank juice for 60 days to get healthy . But when Joe entered his forties he decided it was time to turn his life around. He set himself the challenge of only consuming juice for 60 days to see if the healing power of fruit and veg could make him a new man. He told the MailOnline: 'I was sick and on medication that wasn't fixing me. I just wanted to get well and be healthy. I decided to see if I could change my life by completely by changing my diet and plying my system with nutrients. Then and now: Joe used to weigh 22st, left, and was in poor health before he 'rebooted' and lost six stone . 'For 60 days I would only drink . juice. Then for the next two years after that, I'd only eat foods . derived from plants (seeds, beans, fruits, veg and nuts) and no . animal-based or processed food.' The plan worked and Joe lost six . stone. Six years on, aged 47, he is now medication-free and has never felt . better. His daily diet continues to include a litre of juice a day along . with plant-based foods during the day and an evening meal that will . include animal and processed foods. He filmed his journey to create the award-winning documentary, Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead, that will air on Channel 5 on 10th July. The film has been a worldwide hit and has inspired many to follow Joe's lead with juicing now becoming a way of life for many. Celebrities including Rosie Huntington Whitely and Jessica Alba have accredited their physiques to a juice diet and John Lewis has seen a 130 per cent rise in sales of juicers in the past year. Celeb followers: Actresses Jessica Alba, left, and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley are fans of the juice diet . Prep Time: 5 minutesTotal Time: 10 minutesServing Size: 16oz. (500 mls)Ingredients . Directions . Johnathan Marsh, head of buying for electricals at John Lewis, said: 'The juicing phenomenon is spreading fast across the UK. 'Juicing . is a huge trend for us this year and in response to high levels of . customer demand for juicers we have increased our stock holding by 10 . times compared to last year, and expanded our range.' However, Joe prefers to call his juicing plan a 'reboot' rather than a diet - and anyone can do it to improve their health. He said: 'During a reboot, you'll commit to consuming only fruit and vegetable juices for a period of time. Three days, five days, or 30 days, it's your choice! 'The goal is to help you break a cycle of an unhealthy lifestyle and simply enhance the quality of your diet by increasing your intake of fruits and vegetables.' He added: 'If you're overweight and have tried everything then I would recommend consulting your doctor and then following the juice diet for ten days. 'You'll find you'll fall in love with fruit and veg and the way it makes you feel.' But Joe said a 'reboot' doesn't have to be 'all or nothing'. 'If you don't want to only have juice for a certain number of days then just try adding it into your diet instead. 'Having a litre a day of fruit and veg every morning will make you feel better and lose pounds. It will also fill you up so you feel satisfied and won't want to eat as much during the day,' he explained. Joe believes juicing is the easiest way to stock your body up on vitamins and the juices are easy to make - just wash, cut and blend. For those short on time, he recommends juicing in bulk at the weekend and then storing the juice in the fridge in an air-tight container so it's ready for you to drink every morning during the week.

"As plenty of parents will know, being a working mother involves making some difficult decisions. But few will have gone to quite the same lengths as handbag designer Anya Hindmarch. The businesswoman revealed yesterday that she 'fired herself' from her job because the pressure of juggling her work with raising five children became too much. Miss Hindmarch – a close friend of Samantha Cameron – made the decision to step down as chief executive of her self-titled firm, although she has remained as chief creative officer of the company. Scroll down for video . Handbag tycoon Anya Hindmarch  'fired herself' as CEO of her company because of the pressures of juggling work and her family, pictured with husband James Seymour and two of her five children, Felix and Tia . The 46-year-old, who designed the sought-after 'I am not a plastic bag' tote, said: 'I have just fired myself as CEO. 'I was CEO and obviously overseeing the creative side of the business. And I think the business had grown too big, really, for me. I was working every hour God sends and, with lots of children, that is quite hard.' Miss Hindmarch – whose popular Be A Bag range allows shoppers to personalise their designer totes and washbags with treasured family photographs – has five children aged 11 to 25 with her 59-year-old husband James Seymour, the company's financial director. She made the comments at the British Chambers of Commerce's international trade conference, where she spoke of the challenges of juggling family life with running a global multi-million pound company – admitting that her children had come to consider deep-fried chicken as 'home cooking'. The 46-year-old designed the sought-after 'I am not a plastic bag' tote (left) and Be A Bag range (right) which allows shoppers to personalise their totes and washbags with  family photographs . But despite deciding to scale back her role in the business, she insisted her family benefited from seeing her enjoy her career. She said she believed 'children remember mood more than they do actual presence', adding: 'If you are happy and you have had a really thrilling day, your children will recognise that and be very proud of you. 'So I think do what you need to do. I love working and I think my kids get out a kick out of it too and I would say include them. My children have played hide and seek for years in the basement, my stationery cupboard.' Miss Hindmarch, who was awarded an MBE in 2009, took the decision to step down as CEO three years ago, replacing herself with former Harrods and Gucci executive James McArthur. She launched her fashion label in 1987, and these days her brightly coloured leather handbags regularly sell for more than £1,000 each. The brand now has 56 stores in 17 countries, but its headquarters are still in London.

"It is an internet forum where parents can share advice on subjects such as potty training and the spiralling cost of childcare. But Mumsnet has also attracted thousands of posts on risqué topics, as women members clamour to share details of their explicit bedroom antics. The website – popular with middle-class mothers – risks undermining its wholesome image because many users seem preoccupied with X-rated chatter. A team of moderators delete the most obscene messages, but unless users report a comment, it remains on the site. Yesterday, new threads included ‘Ever s****** anyone famous?’ and ‘I had a dream last night. I’m blushing about it’, which involved a threesome with two men. The day before, users mused over questions such as ‘What is the sexiest thing you have ever had whispered in your ear?’ The website features conversations among women about everything from fivesomes and sex toys to rape fantasies and a bikini wax that became too hands-on. The racy banter risks driving away . mothers who visit the site to discuss topics such as health, politics . and parenting. Several have already expressed their boredom at the . incessant chatter about people’s sex lives. Forum boards: 'Do you dunk your penis' got an array of responses and sparked a flurry of debate on Twitter . When one user, known as Cindy Crawford’s Left Leg, wrote of her husband’s unorthodox suggestion to spice up their sex life, a wearied mother wrote: ‘Yawn, yawn. But cindy … there’s one of these threads at least once a week … they are tres boring … and who really gives a **** about your sex life?’. Members are also often scolded by fellow users for providing ‘tmi’ – too much information – in the discussions about sex. In one post, a woman revealed that her husband ‘took Viagra for the first time last night’, describing what happened next in such graphic detail that one user responded, ‘eyes watering’. A thread about ‘weird sexual  fantasies now you are pregnant’ also prompted admissions of bondage and fantasies about boy band One Direction. On Mumsnet: 'A box of tissues, a small bin, and a beaker of clean water for temporary cleaning/dunking' [Image posed by model] . Men have also turned to the site to seek advice on everything from a wife’s porn addiction to her unwillingness to try new things in the bedroom. Even discussions about education took a steamy turn, with  one user suggesting she  would have to seduce Education Secretary Michael Gove wearing a mortar board and on a desk covered with copies of the national curriculum in order to secure his prompt resignation.

"A former deputy headmaster who admitted using hidden cameras to spy on pupils when they went to the toilet has had his jail term cut following an appeal. Gareth Williams, who worked at Ysgol Gymraeg Gyfun Glantaf in Cardiff, pleaded guilty to 31 charges of voyeurism and making more than 16,000 indecent images of children earlier this year. The married father-of-four, 48, was sentenced to five years in prison at Cardiff Crown Court in May, but has today had that reduced to four years. Williams has had his jail term cut by a fifth after appealing the five-year sentence handed to him in May . Williams, 48, set up pinhole cameras in clocks, fans and toilet cisterns to film semi-naked children, and even put a camera in the toilet of changing rooms on sports day to catch as many as possible. He also installed cameras in two private homes. A total of 31 children at the 1,300-strong school aged between 11 and 16 were captured on camera. At his sentencing in May, prosecutor Michael Jones said: 'This was a serious systematic abuse of trust - a devious and determined invasion of privacy of the children. 'The effect on children, staff and parents was one of complete and utter disbelief.' Today, three judges at the Court of Appeal in London upheld a sentence challenge by Williams, saying his jail term was 'manifestly excessive' and cutting it to four years. Mr Justice Green said Williams, of Rhiwbina, Cardiff, installed the recording devices to get photos of boys for his 'obsessive' gratification. Williams had been deputy headteacher of  the largest Welsh language medium school in the country. He was investigated by police after computer specialists found he had been purchasing paedophilic images on the internet. Williams pleaded guilty to 31 counts of voyerism and making 16,000 indecent images of children in May . His home was raided, and officers discovered two laptops, 11 memory sticks and pinhole camera gear. Williams had also installed software on his computers allowing him to browse the internet undetected. About 99 per cent of the images were at the least serious level, with the rest containing more grave content. Those taken at the school featured naked and semi-naked boys. His catalogue of indecent photos included many downloaded from the web, the court heard. After his arrest, Williams said he had been examining images of boy for 10 years in a bid to 'understand their physical development' and he was less interested in girls. But he also admitted a long-standing interest in boys and accepted it had become a fixation. In May Judge Rhys Rowlands branded Williams 'depraved', telling him his crimes were a 'dreadful and protracted breach of trust'. On appeal today, his defence barrister Davis Elias argued that the sentence was 'simply too long', especially given his mitigation. Williams had worked as the deputy headteacher at Ysgol Gymraeg Gyfun Glantaf in Cardiff (pictured) The barrister said the extensive cataloguing of the voyeurism images by age supported Williams' claim that he was, at least in part, interested in children's physical development. 'Why he behaved in this way will always remain a mystery,' Mr Elias added. Mr Justice Green, sitting with Sir Brian Leveson and Mr Justice Goss, said: 'We conclude that the overall sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. 'We also conclude that insufficient weight was attached to the mitigating features, in particular the devastating impact which the appellant's conduct has had upon his personal life. 'In these circumstances, we quash the sentence of five years' imprisonment and substitute one of four years' imprisonment. 'To this extent, this appeal is allowed.' There was an outcry after Williams continued receiving a salary of around £65,000-a-year after being arrested and remanded in custody in January. He was dismissed by the school following his sentencing in May. It was estimated that he was paid around £16,000 after he made his first guilty pleas. An NSPCC spokesperson said: 'It’s for the courts to determine what sentence an offender gets but we would always want it to be a deterrent - otherwise the wrong message is sent to both the victims and the convicted. 'On his release, it is important that Mr Williams is closely monitored and banned from working with children again.'","Gareth Williams pleaded guilty to 31 charges of voyeurism and making more than 16,000 indecent images of children in May this year .

"Three people have been arrested after the skeletal remains of two men were found in a backyard of a home owned by Satanists in a North Carolina village. Pazuzu Illah Algarad, 35, was arrested and charged with murder last Sunday after the two bodies were discovered in shallow graves at the house in Clemmons where neighbors say he has performed animal sacrifices and satanic rituals. A friend claims that he had 'told everyone' about the bodies, but nobody believed him, and he described how he killed them, ate part of them and then burned the rest in a fire pit. Amber Nicole Burch, 24, who lives with Algarad and is described as his wife on Facebook, was also charged with murder, while 28-year-old Krystal Nicole Matlock has  been charged as an accessory with police alleging that she helped bury the bodies. Held: Pazuzu Illah Algarad, 35, (left) and his 'wife' Amber Nicole Burch, 24, were arrested and charged with murder after the skeletal remains of two men were discovered in shallow graves behind their home . The first victim has been identified as 37-year-old Joshua Fredrick Wetzler while the second victim has been named as Tommy Dean Welch, 36. Police have said they also found animal bones in the property and that more arrests as part of the investigation are possible. After the trio were detained, Forsyth District Judge Gordon Miller assigned capital defenders to represent them. Miller told them that if convicted, they could receive life in prison without the possibility of parole or the death penalty. They are set to appear in court on October 23. Assisted: Krystal Nicole Matlock, 28, has been charged as an accessory with police alleging she helped bury the bodies . On the front door of the house where the skeletal remains were found was a sign warning law-enforcement not to enter. It reads: 'No gang members allowed: anyone that dresses the same, has the same badge and call themselves the authority of the land they did not create. Below and to the right is a picture of a skull and cross bones. Under that picture are the words, 'Evil will triumph'. According to the Winston-Salem Journal, Algarad was born in San Francisco, California, as John Lawson, but dropped out of high school, became a drug dealer. His mother Cynthia Lawson, who is also a Satanist, changed his name to Pazuzu - after the devil that possessed the girl in the film The Exorcis - and claimed it was of Iraqi descent. The Camel City Dispatch reported that his friends said he tried to paint a picture of himself serial killer Charles Manson, founder of the Church of Satan Anton LaVay, and British occultist Aleister Crowley. His tongue was split down the middle like a snake and he allegedly filed down his teeth to sharpen them. In 2010, Algarad was convicted on a charge of accessory after the fact in the shooting death of 30-year-old Joseph Chandler. Chandler's body was found near a river by police after his mother reported him missing that morning. According to state records, Algarad was on probation at the time the bodies were found on Sunday. Scene: Police found the bodies of two men behind the property on Knob Hill Drive in Clemmons, North Carolina . Victims: They have been identified as Joshua Fredrick Wetzler, 37, (left) and Tommy Dean Welch, 36 (right) Entrance: On the front door is a replica skeleton head and a sign warning off law enforcement from entering . Bianca Heath claimed she lived with Algarad for a month in 2005, and that he had spoken of the bones in his back yard. She told The Huffington Post: 'Paz told everyone. But I never believed him. I'm sure no one else believed him either. He laughed about the skeletal remains when telling the story on why he did what he did.' Heath said Algarad told her he picked up two prostitutes at two separate locations before he killed and ate them, burning the remains in a fire pit before burying the rest. In 2011, Burch was accused of slapping Algarad's mother in the face and attempting to choke her. She is described as Algarad's wife on Facebook, but authorities have said there is no legal document to suggest they are together. Couple: Algarad and Burch shared a home in  Clemmons, North Carolina, where animal sacrifices and animal rituals were performed, according to neighbors .","Pazuzu Illah Algarad, 35, was arrested following the discovery in Clemmons .

"The first images have emerged showing Sabrina Allen and her kidnapper mother 12 years after they vanished from Texas. Sabrina, who is now 17, was rescued in Papalotla, Tlaxcala, near Mexico City, during a secret mission on Tuesday morning and is now back in Texas, where she has yet to be reunited with her father. A recent photo shows her blonde locks are long gone; her mother, Dara Llorens, started dyeing her hair to elude authorities after she fled with the girl to Mexico during an unsupervised visit in 2002. Llorens, 44, has also been pictured for the first time in more than a decade - in a mug shot after she was charged with aggravated kidnapping. She is now in the custody of Austin authorities and is being held on a $300,000 bond. Llorens is believed to have undergone 'extensive plastic surgery' to hide from investigators, her ex-husband Greg Allen said on Wednesday. Scroll down for videos . Caught: Dara Llorens has been captured 12 years after snatching her daughter, then four, from Texas and fleeing to Mexico. Her ex-husband said she had undergone plastic surgery to elude authorities . The girl's father told reporters on Wednesday that he has yet to be reunited with his daughter. Sabrina is currently in the care of a clinical psychologist. 'She's in pretty bad shape, from my understanding,' he said as he became emotional. 'She's been told I'm a bad guy, that I'm a wife beater,' he said. 'She's just not ready to see me and my family. I hope and pray that's coming soon, and I can't predict it.' He added that his ex-wife had told their daughter that he didn't want her and that he had committed suicide. The girl had also been told her paternal grandparents were dead, he said. Safe: An image shows Sabrina Allen as a teenager - more than a decade after she was snatched by her mom . Safe: The little girl, pictured as a child, was four years old when she was taken. Her mother dyed her blonde hair to escape authorities and moved around with her constantly to avoid being found . Allen had divorced Llorens before she vanished with their daughter - then four years old - during an unsupervised visit in 2002. He has since remarried and has had more children. He said that the 12-year search for his daughter had been a roller coaster filled with false leads. 'I was Ahab and the white whale. I was not going to survive,' he said. 'It's a long road. You don't know what the outcome is.' The rescue came thanks to an anonymous tip sent last month to Private Investigator Philip Klein, whom Greg Allen hired nine years ago. After receiving the tip, Klein contacted state and federal authorities to confirm the identities of the woman and girl using facial recognition. After watching them for two weeks, agents swooped in. Snatched: Llorens allegedly took her daughter into Mexico after she was supposed to hand the child over to the custody of her father. Greg Allen said his ex-wife has apparently had plastic surgery to appear different . Apartment: They were found living in Papalotla, Tlaxcala near Mexico City and captured on Tuesday morning . 'She put up quite a good fight,' Klein said of Llorens. 'There were minor injuries to one of the agents.' In a video he posted to GoFundMe page on Wednesday, Allen said that Sabrina had been found with her blonde locks dyed brown. Her mother started dyeing her hair after she was kidnapped. 'She was not in school and her education is reportedly several years behind,' he said. 'She was effectively a prisoner in a two-bedroom apartment.' Authorities said that Llorens had repeatedly moved around with her daughter, always fearful investigators or Greg Allen would catch up with them. Still, Sabrina is physically well and has dreams for the future, including becoming a ballerina, authorities said. Never giving up: Sabrina's father, Greg Allen (pictured), hired a private investigator to find his daughter and it was a tip sent to this PI last month that ultimately led to the girl's rescue . Emotional: In a video released on Wednesday, Sabrina's father Greg said that his daughter had been told that she didn't want him and that he had committed suicide. They have yet to be reunited . Greg Allen has stayed committed to the search over the past decade and the case has twice featured on 'America's Most Wanted'. Sabrina had also been listed as missing by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, while her mother was on the FBI's Most Wanted list. Llorens allegedly violated a court-ordered child custody agreement and disappeared with the child shortly after taking her on April 19, 2002, during a scheduled weekend visit. When she was supposed to return the girl two days later, she never did. The mother and her daughter were tracked down to Mexico City after 14 months but managed to get away from authorities. Pictures taken at the time showed the girl's blonde locks dyed brown. Changed: When the girl was spotted, left, in Mexico City 14 months later, her mother had apparently dyed her blonde locks, right, dark brown. An image right shows what the family thought she might look like . Taken: Sabrina Allen, who is now 17, has returned to Texas and is being evaluated, her family said . At the time, they were living under the assumed names Blanca Aurora Fabian Urieb and Adriana Fabian Uribe. They were last seen living there in June 2003. Last March, Greg Allen vowed never to give up looking for his daughter. 'I want to find her,' Allen told Fox7. 'I want to see her again. She needs to know she has a family that loves her.

"It seems discrimination in the workplace is on the rise, with nearly 50 percent are coming from pregnant mothers, new report has found. The Fair Work Ombudsman found 47 percent of complaints were pregnancy related, which rose from 28 percent since the 2012-2013 figures. The report highlighted  the number of complaints about pregnancy discrimination at work and losing their jobs for taking maternity leave. The report found 47 percent of complaints were pregnancy related in the workplace . 'We are working with the Australian Human Rights Commission to identify ways we can support working parents,' the report says. 'In 2013–14, we attended their national roundtable and contributed data to their national review into the prevalence, nature and consequences of discrimination in relation to pregnancy at work and return to work after parental leave.' Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James said that failing to respect the rights of pregnant employees is a serious matter. 'It is the responsibility of employers to make sure they are aware of their obligations under workplace laws and that they treat workers fairly,' Ms James said. 'We want to increase awareness that discriminating against pregnant women is a serious breach of workplace laws and won't be tolerated.' A number of pregnancy complaints and losing their jobs for taking maternity leave were reported . Sex Discrimination Commissioner Elizabeth Broderick told Daily Telegraph that she was not surprised with the figures, adding she also found half of working mothers experience discrimination in her surveys. 'I met women who were asked to make a choice - the job or the baby,' she told Daily Telegraph. 'The underlying implication was if you want to keep your job you need to terminate your pregnancy. And I met women who hard terminated their pregnancy as result of that.' The next most common discrimination complaints in the workplace were disability with 20 percent, followed by family and carer's responsibilities at 10 percent. Under the Fair Work Act, it is unlawful to discriminate against employees on the grounds of pregnancy, race, colour, sex, sexual preference, age, physical or mental disability, marital status, family or carer responsibilities, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin. Discriminatory behaviour can include dismissing an employee, threatening to dismiss an employee, reducing an employee's hours, denying training and promotion opportunities or refusing to employ, promote or train an employee. The penalties imposed in the case also relate to contraventions of workplace laws relating to keeping employment records, complying with a Notice to Produce records and obtaining written agreements for part-time employees.

"Stephan Shay honored older brother Ryan by running the New York City Marathon for the first time. The 28-year-old from Huntington Beach, California, did it in impressive fashion, finishing 16th on Sunday in 2 hours, 19 minutes, 47 seconds. 'The time doesn't mean anything because of the difficult conditions, but the place I'm psyched about,' Shay said. Determined: Stephan Shay (pictured) honored older brother Ryan by running the New York City Marathon for the first time - he did it in impressive fashion, finishing 16th on Sunday in 2 hours, 19 minutes, 47 seconds . The race was about more than a time or place for Stephan Shay. It was nearly seven years ago to the day that Ryan was running in the Olympic qualifier in New York and died just a few miles into the race in Central Park. An autopsy revealed he died of natural causes after developing an irregular heartbeat that stemmed from an enlarged and scarred heart. Stephan Shay said that it was tough Sunday when he passed that spot near the end of the race. Sudden loss: It was nearly seven years ago to the day that Ryan Shay (pictuerd centre) was running in the Olympic qualifier in New York and died of natural causes just a few miles into the race in Central Park . 'I got pretty emotional and got teary eyed,' the Michigan native said. 'I never had that in a race before where the emotion came over me. For a few moments there it was tough, but I knew I had to regain my composure.' It helped Stephan that brother Nathan and a few family members were waiting at that spot to cheer him on. Also, not far away was a bench dedicated to Ryan with his words: 'It is necessary to dig deep within oneself to discover the hidden grain of steel called will.' Stephan heeded Ryan's advice and dug deep. He picked off two guys along the way to become the fourth American to cross the finish line. 'To be the fourth American in a pretty solid field was awesome,' Shay said. 'If you told me that beforehand I'd be pretty pleased.' This wasn't Stephan's first time running in New York since his brother died. He did a half marathon in the city in 2011, but this one was more difficult. Experienced runner: This wasn't Stephan's first time running in New York since his brother died - He did a half marathon in the city in 2011, but this one was more difficult . Running career: Stephan hopes to run in the Olympic qualifiers in 2016 and make it to the Rio Olympics . 'I knew when I decided to enter the race in July that this was going to be tough,' Stephan said. Stephan's father, Joe, couldn't make the race, but was thrilled with his son's effort. Joe Shay said that it was tough when Stephan had told him a few weeks earlier that he was going to run New York. 'He knew I'd have a difficult time with it,' the elder Shay said choking up in a phone conversation. 'I'm so proud of him and grateful he's making an effort. One day I'll come to New York and watch it. Maybe next time he runs, we'll show up and get to see him. it would be a great joy to see that.' Joe Shay said he spent the day honoring Ryan. He watched the beginning of his son's race before heading to church to attend a mass dedicated to Ryan. He was still able to follow the race on the marathon's mobile tracker. Competitive spirit: Stephan (not pictured) picked off two guys along the way to become the fourth American to cross the finish line at the New York City marathon on Sunday . 'We're going over to Ryan's grave site later,' Joe Shay said. 'I'm sure he'll be happy to hear how well his brother did.' Stephan hopes to run in the Olympic qualifiers in 2016 and make it to the Rio Olympics. He qualified when he ran the Houston Half Marathon in 1:02.26 in 2010. But a foot injury cropped up soon after that hindered his rise. Two years ago he had surgery on his left foot to remove a fibroma that kept him from running for months. Soon after the foot healed he started to run again. He decided if he was going to run the New York Marathon in his brother's honor he was going to run fast. Boy did he.","Stephan Shay, 28, from California honored older brother Ryan by running the New York City Marathon for the first time .

"Thug: Jai Falconer has been jailed for six years for beating up his mother Joyce, 69, over £20 . A thug addicted to drugs and alcohol broke his own mother's back because she refused to lend him £20. Jai Falconer has been jailed for six years for the brutal attack on his pensioner mother Joyce, 69, in his childhood home. A court heard the 40-year-old woke his mother up by banging on her door in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire at  7am on June 7. Falconer told his mother he was going to make himself breakfast  before demanding to borrow £20. When she refused he punched her in the face before throwing her to the ground and took cash from her purse. Falconer then grabbed his mother by the throat and beat her with a plastic brush as she lay on the kitchen floor. The pensioner managed to struggle to the front door and alerted a neighbour who had already dialled 999 after hearing the disturbance. She was taken to hospital where it was confirmed she had a fractured vertebrae in her back. Yesterday Falconer admitted robbery and grievous bodily harm at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court and Judge Paul Glenn jailed him for six years. He also made him subject to a restraining order, preventing him from contacting his mother and going within 100 yards of her home. Prosecutor Paul Farrow told the court Falconer, stole £60 and Mrs Falconer now wears a supportive brace and may need surgery on her back. He added: 'He looked around the fridge and said he was going to have toast, and wanted £10. Then straight away he said 'no, give me £20'. Shocking: Stoke Crown Court heard that Falconer beat his mother so viciously she broke her back before she crawled to the front door for help . 'She said she didn't have any money. He asked where her purse was in an aggressive tone. 'Using his right fist, he punched her on the right side of the head. This blow knocked her backwards and she said she'd had enough of this. 'He pushed past her and rushed upstairs. His mother followed him. He went to her bedroom, grabbed her handbag and took out her purse. 'He went back to the kitchen and emptied the contents on the table. 'Ms Falconer told him to give her purse back and finally said she had had enough and was phoning the police. 'The defendant reached towards his mother, telling her she wasn't. 'He grabbed her by the throat, causing her to fall backwards and onto the floor. 'She lay on the floor, curled up in a ball. The defendant then began to hit her with a plastic kitchen brush, at least five or six times, striking her all over her body.' Defending Falconer, Anis Ali said: 'It's clear that the catalyst of this offending appears to be his habitual use of illicit substances and alcohol. 'It was a sense of desperation that lead him to be in the situation he found himself. I don't condone what he did. It's a serious situation and unpleasant. 'He does express regret and understands what he did was wrong.'","Jai Falconer jailed for six years for the brutal attack on mother Joyce, 69 .

"A teenager was taking photographs in fields near his home in Cornwall when he spotted what he believes may be the legendary beast of Bodmin Moor. Henry Warren, 19, said: 'I was taking pictures of our new house when I saw something run across the field and in front of my lens. 'It was absolutely massive and was hopping up and down like a large cat - there's no way it was a fox or a dog.'

Mr Warren managed to take several frames before the animal disappeared into undergrowth in the field at Gwinear, just a few miles from remote Bodmin Moor where the phantom wildcat is said to roam. He said: 'It ran around 60 metres in just a few seconds and was leaping in the air with its front two legs first. 'I did some research and thought it may be linked to the Beast of Bodmin - it certainly looks like a big cat.' Britain’s most famous big cat was first allegedly spotted in 1983, since when there have been more than 60 reported sightings.  In 1995 it was declared a phantom by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food conducted an official investigation into the 'beast' and other unknown animals reported to be roaming Britain in 1995. What on earth is it? This picture, taken at Gwinear by Mr Warren, shows a feline-looking animal on the run . It concluded . there was no 'verifiable evidence' of exotic felines loose in Britain. But it also stated that the investigation could not prove that big cats . were 'not present'. In . 2005, a skull with large fangs and what was thought to be the remains . of a big cat were found in the River Fowey close to the moor. The . skull was sent to the Natural History Museum in London for . verification, where it was decided that it was a genuine skull from a . young male leopard.  They also found that the cat had not died in . Britain. In fact, the skull had been imported as part of a leopard-skin rug.","Student Henry Warren was taking photographs in field at Gwinear, Cornwall .
