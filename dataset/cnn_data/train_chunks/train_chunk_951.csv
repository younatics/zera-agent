"By . Associated Press . and Zoe Szathmary for MailOnline . Four people, including a 14-year-old boy, have been charged for the murder of French street artist Bilal Berreni, whose body was discovered a year ago near an abandoned Detroit public housing project. The 14-year-old was charged Thursday with first-degree murder and armed robbery in the fatal shooting. The boy was 13 at the time of the killing of 23-year-old Berreni. Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy said in a statement that the boy and three other then-teenagers carried out the attack. Dionte Travis, 17; Jasin Curtis, 18; and Drequone Rich, 20, were arraigned Wednesday on first-degree murder and armed robbery charges. They return to court Sept. 11 for a probable cause hearing. Charged: Jasin Curtis, left, and Drequone Rich, right, were arraigned Wednesday on first-degree murder and armed robbery charges in the fatal shooting of French street artist Bilal Berreni . Charged: Dionte Travis also faces first-degree murder and armed robbery charges . 'It sickens me that a young, talented artist who had traveled the world to pursue his passion was murdered here, thus reinforcing the stereotypes for many about our city of Detroit,' Worthy said in a statement. On Thursday, the 14-year-old had his first court appearance in the case. The judge ordered him detained until his next appearance Sept. 11. The youngest defendant is designated as an adult in the juvenile court system, Worthy said. If he's convicted, a judge could sentence him as a juvenile, an adult or a juvenile for a period, then an adult. Prosecutors aren't naming him because of his age, and said they didn't know if the 14-year-old has a lawyer. Lawyers for Curtis and Travis declined comment from the Associated Press on Thursday, while Rich didn't have a lawyer on record Thursday. Victim: Street artist Bilal Berreni, a Paris native, was found with a gunshot wound to the face on July 29, 2013, outside the Frederick Douglass Homes . Global traveler: Berreni - seen in a Vimeo of his work - signed his work under the name the Zoo Project, gaining attention in 2011 through work in Tunisia in which he made life-size pictures of people killed in unrest in that North African nation . 'I don't think Billy understood the nature of, like, going to the Brewster Projects at four, five or six in the morning, and the dangers therein,' friend Gustav Brovold told WXYZ. WXYZ reported that Travis, Curtis and Rich 'are reportedly part of a gang that police believe is linked to a number of robberies.' Berreni, a Paris native, was found with a gunshot wound to the face on July 29, 2013, outside the Frederick Douglass Homes. No identification was on his body, and it was seven months before Michigan State Police identified him, using fingerprints. Berreni began painting on walls in his neighborhood at age 15, according to French media reports. He later graduated from an applied arts school, then left to pursue his work around the world. He signed his work under the name the Zoo Project, gaining attention in 2011 through work in Tunisia in which he made life-size pictures of people killed in unrest in that North African nation. 'From what I understand, he was interested in what can be born out of chaos,' father Mourad Berreni told The Detroit Free Press in a March interview. 'For him, it represented the failure of capitalism and believed that from that chaos something can be born.' 'He was an enlightened being, pure, who did not make any concession with society,' he told the newspaper.'He felt that he had to say what he believed.' 'One day, I saw him drawing in Paris. He said, ""Look, Daddy,"" and he remained silent,' he also said. 'He was painting a bunch of guys typing on computers all connected one to another to say that they are all dependent, an absurd society. That was Bilal.' He visited Detroit in 2012 and again in 2013. His father said he occasionally may have lived as a squatter in vacant structures.

"By . Aap . and Emily Crane for Daily Mail Australia . A 23-year-old woman who was stabbed to death multiple times on her way home from work knew her alleged killer, police say. The man accused of killing Shandee Blackburn in Mackay, north of Brisbane, in February last year was arrested on Thursday after an 18-month police investigation. John Peros, 32, appeared in the Brisbane Magistrates Court on Friday to face charges of murder and robbery with wounding. Shandee Blackburn, 23, was stabbed to death on her way home from work in Mackay, north of Brisbane, in February last year . Peros wore a green prison-issue sweater and brown tracksuit pants as Magistrate Noel Nunan ordered he be remanded in custody until his next appearance. He was arrested and charged after new evidence came to light during coercive hearings held by state's Crime and Corruption Commission over the past six months. Police said Peros was known to Ms Blackburn and information from residents had been vital to the investigation. Ms Blackburn was stabbed and had her handbag stolen as she walked home from the Harrup Country Club where she worked in the earlier hours of February 9, 2013. John Peros, 32, was arrested on Thursday and faced court accused of Shandee Blackburn's murder . The waitress was only 150 metres from her home when she was attacked. Outside the court on Friday, Ms Blackburn's mother Vicki said it was important to be there for her daughter, but said it was hard to see her accused killer. 'I just felt sick, just felt sick,' she said. But Ms Blackburn said it was a relief to finally have a sense that justice was being served. 'I think tonight will be the first time I can go to bed and feel some peace,' she said. Police conducted an 18-month investigation into Ms Blackburn's death and released this CCTV image of the murder suspect . Ms Blackburn's older sister Shannah said the ordeal had been extremely hard on their family. 'For us we still know there's such a long road to go. But to get to this point, it's a first step on this long road. It's a step in the right direction,' she said. Outside court, Peros's lawyer bristled when asked about details of the police brief against his client. 'How the f*** would I know,' Mr Bale said. Ms Blackburn was only 150 metres from her home when she was attacked and had her handbag stolen . He had a similar reaction when asked by a journalist about where Peros was arrested. 'I'm not telling you that either, f*** off,' he said. Mr Bale did say his client was doing reasonably well in the circumstances and had given him instructions to contest all of the charges. 'When the time comes the matter will be litigated in a court, not in the media, thanks.' The case against Peros is due for mention in the Mackay Magistrates Court on October 9.

"By . Marielle Simon for Daily Mail Australia . When Brisbane man Ryan Heffernan split with his girlfriend their child was just one year old. It was then, the 41 year-old journalist's life came crashing down. Hhis new role as a single father saw him strcuk down with depression and lose his  job at Channel 7 in Sydney. 'I was totally cocky and I thought I could do this - it was never in my head that I would do anything other than 50/50 and then I realised my talents were not near the standards of my ego,' Mr Heffernan told Daily Mail Australia. 'I wasn't ready for it.' Scroll down for video . When Brisbane man Ryan Heffernan, (left) split with his girlfriend their child was just one year's old . Ryan and his ex-girlfriend moved to Sydney about seven months before they split up, leaving him completely isolated and without help from his support system back home in Brisbane. The weeks Ryan was without his son, Louis, he noticed a destructive change in his lifestyle. 'On the week I didn't have him I was drinking and partying far too much, blocking out that I didn't have the kid - that's how I managed it, which was really stupid because I ended up with depression.' It was when Ryan and his former partner sold their property that he decided to leave his high-intensity job, and threw himself into freelance writing and short-term contract work - which allowed him to live a flexible life, once   enough money was saved. Like many single dads, Ryan had difficulty fitting into mothers' groups, describing his area - Manly in Sydney's northern beaches - as affluent and influential, where mums do mum things and men go to work. 'There are mother groups everywhere but dad groups are a few and far between,' he said. But it was the inspiration that came from being a single dad to Louis, now six years-old, that led him to write 'SuperDad SpeedBible', a 'high-performance toolbox for men with young kids.' Ryan has shared five tips he learned as a dad, in the hopes it will help other newly single dads cope with the transition. Like many single dads, Ryan had difficulty fitting into the mum's groups, describing his area Manly, Sydney, as affluent and influential, where mums do mum things and men go to work . THE UNIVERSE DOES NOT REVOLVE AROUND ME . The first and fastest thing I learned as a dad was that I am, despite my long held belief, not the centre of the universe. The birth of my son coincided with the confronting realisation that I would now be the perpetual bridesmaid in our lives forever more. Strangely, this was actually quite liberating. A LATE NIGHT FILLED WITH PIZZA AND WINE COULD NO LONGER OCCUR . The second realisation I made was that cheesy pizzas, wine and late nights to bed would ensure my parental downfall. Not like any other human being I had ever met, my child had boundless energy and a limitless need for high-grade entertainment. A fat, unfit bachelor was simply never going to cut it. So I got fit. The weeks Ryan was without his son, Louis, he noticed a destructive change in his lifestyle . Ryan has shared five tips he learnt as a dad, in the hopes it will help other newly single dads cope with the transition . FAILURE IS ALWAYS AN OPTION . As a single parent I also learned that failure is always an option. In fact failure is the norm. Stretched to the outer reaches of functional life I realised I would never be fully happy with my performance at work or as a parent. And so for the first time in my life I began trying NOT to bite off more than I could chew. GUILT IS A WASTE EMOTION . Following on from point 3, I will forever be indebted to my son for teaching me that guilt is an utterly, absolutely, entirely and completely a wasted emotion. If you let it, guilt will infiltrate your work and your family. It’ll eat you up when the reality is guilt, by definition, is about what you did in the past, not what you are doing right now. And now is what counts. BUDDHA KNOWS BEST . Following on from point 4, I will be forever indebted to my son for taking the form of the pristine Buddha in our household. When you are a single parent with an only child they only have you to entertain and nurture them. That means you simply must learn how to get “in the moment” and give them your undivided attention. It took years, but my little Buddha taught me how. Ryan said Louis, (right) was very excited when he realized the book was inspired by him. He said ""Does that mean I’m going to be famous?"" Ryan said if he could be a stay at home dad and write full time it would be great .

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . Tired, with their faces smeared with coal dust, 29 of the 34 Bosnian miners who spent the night trapped deep underground were rescued today - though up to five others are feared dead. Rescuers pulled the men out one by one, after they endured a terrifying night trapped 500 metres (1,600 feet) underground when the Raspotocje coal mine collapsed in Zenica, central Bosnia. Anxious family members cried with happiness as they embraced their loved ones. Ambulances were parked outside the mine entrance to take the miners for a medical check-up. Rubble covered but reunited: One of the miners is hugged by family members after being freed today . Crying with happiness: One of the trapped men clutches his helmet as he is led away from the mine . Sooty faced: A freed coal miner leaves after he was trapped inside Raspotocje coal mine in Zenica . To the rescue: One of the exhausted miners is carried towards an ambulance by rescue workers . 'He is alive!' Admira Durakovic, whose husband Amir was among the miners, cried before breaking down sobbing and shaking. Mine Manager Esad Civic said 29 miners had been rescued, but miners and rescuers at the scene said they feared three of the miners had died, while Sinan Husic, head of the regional miners union, said the death toll could be five. Alija Celebic, himself a retired miner, waited for his son Bego, who was rescued safely. 'He was hurt in the mine just two weeks ago, and now this!' Celebic said. 'All is good as long as he is alive!' Cheerio: One of the miners waves goodbye to his colleagues as he is led away by a family member and a helper . Emotional: A weeping miner is led away by rescuers after a gas explosion left him and 33 others stuck . Pulled to safety: 29 of the 34 miners have been rescued, but up to five others are feared dead . The union leader at the Zenica coal mine, Mehmed Oruc, said two tunnels in the mine collapsed yesterday evening following a gas explosion triggered by a minor earthquake that had hit the area near the town. He said 22 other miners managed to leave the pit after the tunnels collapsed, two of whom were injured. Those coming out of the pit appeared shaken and tired, some were weak on their feet, but none seemed seriously injured. The men walked slowly as their wives, children and other relatives ran towards them with joy. Bright lights: One of the miners squints after spending the last 18 hours in pitch black . A shoulder to cry on: A family member weeps as he supports one of his relatives who was stuck in the mine . Check-up: There were ambulances waiting to check the miners over after their ordeal . The Zenica coal mine was the site of one of the greatest mining tragedies in Bosnia's history, when 39 miners were killed in a gas explosion in 1982. This is the third incident in the mine this year. A total of 16 miners were hurt in two previous gas explosions, the most recent less than four weeks ago. Families and the union leaders accused the management of responding poorly to the accident, particularly in initially claiming that only eight people were trapped inside the pit. Union leaders said authorities only brought in rescue machinery seven hours after the blast. Mine manager Esad Civcic insisted that 'mine accidents cannot be avoided', although he did concede that the  mine - once among the most modern in Europe - is now far from world standard, following the 1992-95 war that impoverished the country. Muris Tutnjic, one of the miners who got out yesterday but came to the site today to show support, said the blast 'just blew us away'. He added: 'I was alone. Thank God I managed to pull myself out. My colleagues - they were some 200, 300 maybe 400 metres away from me, they got covered.'","Miners were trapped 500 metres (1,600 feet) below ground overnight .

"By . James Chapman . and Ian Drury for the Daily Mail . and Tom McTague, Deputy Political Editor for MailOnline . The Royal Navy’s second new aircraft carrier is to be brought into service instead of being sold off. The unexpected announcement about the 65,000-ton HMS Prince Of Wales was made at the Nato summit in Wales. The Queen launched the first of the two new vessels, HMS Queen Elizabeth, in July, amid concerns over whether Britain could afford the £6.2billion cost for both carriers. Scroll down for video . An artist's impression of one of the Royal Navy's planned super aircraft carriers - HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales . David Cameron answered questions during a news conference at the final day of the NATO summit at the Celtic Manor resort, near Newport, in Wales . NATO leaders agreed Friday to set up a rapid reaction force as part of efforts to reassure allies rattled by the Ukraine crisis . After coming to power in 2010, David Cameron had wanted to scrap one of the carriers as part of defence cuts. The previous plan was that the ship would be sold off or mothballed. But the Prime Minister told a press conference at the summit’s conclusion that yesterday’s decision will ensure there is always one carrier available. ‘They are an investment in British security, British prosperity and our place in the world, transforming our ability to project power globally whether independently or with our allies,’ he said. But the Government still faces criticism because the carriers will not sail with combat jets until at least 2020. Meanwhile, at the summit the Nato members also pledged to reverse the trend of declining defence budgets. All 28 countries agreed to meet the target of spending 2 per cent of GDP on defence. The summit ended with an announcement by Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko that a ceasefire agreement had been reached with Russian-backed separatists in the east of the country. The new Queen Elizabeth Class ships  will give the Royal Navy the ability to operate aircraft carriers 100 per cent of the time . But Mr Cameron said that sanctions against Russia agreed by the European Union last weekend and due to be detailed later today will go ahead, with the possibility of them being withdrawn if the ceasefire holds. The summit in Newport saw Nato agree to establish a new high-readiness ‘spearhead’ force able to deploy thousands of troops in a matter of days. The alliance is also preparing to ‘pre-position’ supplies of fuel and ammunition in bases in eastern Europe, in moves designed to counter the threat of Russian aggression and provide reassurance to Nato members Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Mr Cameron confirmed that the UK will provide a battle group and a brigade headquarters for the new spearhead force, as well as 3,500 personnel to take part in exercises in eastern Europe between now and the end of 2015 as part of a Nato effort to ensure a persistent presence in the region. Helicopters and F-35B Joint Strike Fighter will be able to operate off the giant aircraft carriers . He said: ‘We will continue our efforts to support Ukraine, including by providing financial assistance to improve their command, control and communication capabilities. ‘Nato members across Europe - particularly in Central and Eastern Europe - have been reassured that this is an Alliance that will meet its treaty obligations to come to the defence of any member under threat. ‘No-one will leave here with any doubt that our collective security is as strong as it has ever been. The Alliance is firmly committed to providing ongoing reassurance to our eastern allies.’","HMS Prince of Wales is being built but was set to be sold off to save cash .

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . Around 120 million girls worldwide - more than one in 10 - have been raped or sexually assaulted by the age of 20, according to a United Nations report. It also found a fifth of murder victims globally are under 20, resulting in 95,000 deaths in 2012. Drawing on data from 190 countries, the report from the UN children's agency, Unicef, notes that children around the world are routinely exposed to physical, sexual and emotional violence ranging from murder and forced sexual acts to bullying and abusive discipline. Scroll down for video . Nigerian Islamist rebel group Boko Haram kidnapped 276 girls earlier this year . The violence 'cuts across boundaries of age, geography, religion, ethnicity and income brackets,' Unicef executive director Anthony Lake said. 'It occurs in places where children should be safe, their homes, schools and communities. Increasingly, it happens over the internet, and it's perpetrated by family members and teachers, neighbours and strangers and other children.' Unicef found that murder is the leading cause of death among males between the ages of 10 and 19 in several countries in Central and South America, including Brazil, Panama, Venezuela, El Salvador, and Guatemala. Nigeria, where the Boko Haram terrorist group abducted more than 200 schoolgirls in April and threatened to marry them off, had the largest number of young murder victims, with almost 13,000 deaths in 2012, followed by Brazil with about 11,000, the study found. Boko Haram   leader Abubakar Shekau speaking to the camera after this year's abduction . Women protest against the release of the 276 girls kidnapped girls taken by Boko Haram fighters in Nigeria . Among countries in Western Europe and North America, the United States has the highest child homicide rate, it said. Sexual violence is widespread - according to the report - about one in 10 girls around the world under 20, an estimated 120 million, have been forced into sex acts. Meanwhile, one in three married adolescent girls, about 84 million, have been victims of emotional, physical or sexual violence committed by their husbands or partners. Unicef said the prevalence of partner violence is 70 per cent or higher in Congo and Equatorial Guinea and approaches or exceeds 50 per cent in Uganda, Tanzania and Zimbabwe. In Switzerland, it said a 2009 study found 22 per cent of girls and 8 per cent of boys aged 15 to 17 had experienced at least one incident of sexual violence, most commonly stemming from interactions on the internet. The report showed the impact of violence on children has grown over the last decade and cited a number of reasons why the phenomenon remains largely ignored. Violence against children in some countries is socially accepted, tacitly condoned or not seen as being abusive, Unicef said. Victims are too young or too vulnerable to report the crimes, the legal system cannot adequately respond, and child protection services are also scarce. Susan Bissell, chief of the child protection unit at Unicef, said the 'horrific atrocities that children experience on a daily basis everywhere in the world' demonstrate the urgent need for all countries to put a spotlight on the problem. Much of the violence against children is perpetrated by the people tasked with taking care of them. On average, about six in 10 children worldwide, or almost 1 billion, between the ages of two and 14 are regularly subjected to physical punishment. 'We're not talking about a little smack on the bottom,' Ms Bissell said. 'We're talking about a blunt instrument, and repeated.' Only 39 countries worldwide protect children legally from corporal punishment, the report found. Often, the violence goes unreported. One of the reasons for this is that violence seems normal. Nearly half of all girls worldwide, between 15 and 19, think a husband is sometimes justified in hitting or beating his wife, the report found. According to Unicef, slightly more than a third of students between the ages of 13 and 15 worldwide are regularly bullied in school - and in Samoa, the proportion rises to three-quarters. In Europe and North America, almost a third of students aged 11 to 15 report bullying others - and in Latvia and Romania the number rose to nearly 60 per cent. A separate Unicef report lays out six strategies to prevent and respond to violence against children. The steps include providing support for families and caregivers in hopes of reducing the risk of violence within the home.","Report also shows a fifth of murder victims worldwide are under 20 .

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . A solitary, strangely-shaped building known by locals as the 'doughnut' is all that will ever exist of what the Spanish hoped would become an ambitious 'Legal City' in Madrid. The Madrid Regional Government has cancelled the 500 million-euro project with just one building erected, due to lack of funding. Around 19 million euros had already been invested in the plan, which is the latest in a number of Spanish projects forced to be cancelled because of the financial crisis. The doughnut - more officially known as the Legal Medical Institute - is now nothing but an abandoned reminder, and has a sign outside banning people from entering. The sorry building site is beside Barajas Airport, and also close to the Madrid Four Towers skyscrapers and Real Madrid sport city. Spain was hit extremely hard by the recession, and this has resulted in a number of half-finished buildings being dotted around the country. They include the InTempo skyscraper in Bedidorm - a 47-storey block of flats which was left without a lift - and the Nou Mestalla - a 61,500-seater football stadium designed to be the new home of Valencia, where construction started in 2007, but still sits unfinished.

"By . Sean Poulter for the Daily Mail . Three baby foods as well as crisps, cereals and chips contain raised levels of a chemical linked to cancer. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) found higher than expected levels of acrylamide in a range of popular products. The substance, which develops during the cooking process, has been linked to a higher risk of cancer. Scroll down for video . Three baby foods as well as crisps, cereals and chips contain raised levels of a chemical linked to cancer according to research from the FSA (file picture used above) The watchdog is investigating why the levels are raised and what can be done to reduce them, but has not advised consumers to stop eating the affected foods. The FSA conducts annual tests for acrylamide in food products. Its survey for 2013, published this week, found high levels of the chemical in apple rice cakes from Organix, Sunny Start baby wheat flakes and Heinz breakfast banana multigrain for babies. Also affected were crisps, cereals and some frozen potato products, which were found to be likely to develop too much acrylamide if cooked to package instructions. When food is cooked at high temperatures, a process called the Maillard reaction makes it brown and adds taste and crunch. However, the reaction creates acrylamide. The chemical is also used in industry to make polymers for applications in paper making, water treatment and sealants. Table shows which brands were tested for the chemical acrylamide - which has been linked to cancer . The FSA’s guidelines say that consumers should cook chips only to a light gold and should toast bread ‘to the lightest colour acceptable’ to reduce exposure to acrylamide. This week, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) issued similar guidelines, including warning against storing potatoes in the fridge. This increases the sugar level, which is linked to browning, it said. It added: ‘Tests show that acrylamide in the diet causes cancer in animals. Scientists conclude that acrylamide in food potentially increases cancer risk.’ The World Health Organisation has said the chemical ‘indicates a human health concern’ when found in food. Dr Diane Benford, an FSA specialist who heads EFSA’s committee on food contaminants, said that when acrylamide breaks down in the body, another substance called glycidamide is formed. She added: ‘Glycidamide is the most likely cause of gene mutations and tumours seen in animal studies.’ The British Retail Consortium, which represents supermarkets, said acrylamide levels in food are falling. It added: ‘Retailers will continue to work with suppliers to limit the occurrence of acrylamide in foods.’ Cow & Gate, maker of Sunny Start, said safety is ‘incredibly important’ and it is investigating the ‘anomalous’ result. Organix said it has reduced levels in its rice cakes since the tests and there is ‘no cause for concern’. Heinz said its affected baby cereal has been discontinued.","FSA conducts annual test for acrylamide - substance linked to cancer risk .

The details of the circumstances of the discovery in both incidents were not clear. It comes just hours after another man was arrested in Shepherdswell, Kent, on suspicion of being an illegal immigrant after he hid in the back of a woman's car as she travelled through the Eurotunnel from France to Britain. It is understood the latest discovery was made after police attended an unrelated report of a caravan overturning in the area. The caravan which was unknowingly carrying the immigrant was being driven along the motorway towards London from the Channel Tunnel. The man was detained by police and has since been transferred to the Home Office Immigration Enforcement for them to take further action. Yesterday, 59-year-old Sue Taber called police after discovering a man hidden in her car having driven from Spain to France and back to Britain via the Eurotunnel. Ms Taber was shocked to find a human leg protruding from out behind the driver's seat after parking up outside her home following the 53 mile cross-Channel journey. She said she noticed the stranger as she let her two dogs out of the car and said the 5ft 8in man, aged between 18 and 20, emerged from her vehicle shouting: 'I'm an orphan, I'm an orphan'. Ms Taber, who believes the man got into her car while she left it briefly unattended and unlocked at Calais, France, admitted she had felt something nudging her back on her journey, but assumed it was just one of her dogs fetching a ball. Sue Taber, 59, discovered a man hiding behind the driver's seat in her Fiat Panda having driven  from Calais, France, to her home in Shepherdswell, Kent. The man jumped out of the car shouting: 'I'm an orphan' The stowaway was found in Ms Taber's car having got in while she left her car unattended in Calais, France . She believes the stowaway climbed into her Fiat Panda and hid behind the seat after she left it unattended and unlocked while she checked her two dogs in at the French port of Calais. After making the discovery, she shouted at the stowaway 'in no uncertain terms' to 'get lost' before she went inside her home to dial 999 as he fled just before 9.30am. He was later located by police, arrested and transferred to the Home Office. The two discoveries show the heightened desperation by illegal immigrants desperate to flee to Britain – with more than 250 storming a Britain-bound P&O ferry on Wednesday. They tried to force their way on board the vessel at Calais and security staff were forced to turn a fire hose on them as they attempted to overpower officials. Cross-Channel travellers are now being warned to stay alert when travelling through the French port, where more than 80 police officers and 40 riot police have been drafted in as part of heightened patrols. Eurotunnel spokesman John Keefe said today that the company's site at Calais was extremely secure but added: 'Everybody travelling through Calais should be vigilant whenever they leave their vehicle.' The mayor of Calais also last night begged David Cameron to visit Calais to tell the waiting hordes that Britain was 'no El Dorado'. Natacha Bouchart said the UK was too soft on migrants. More than 250 illegal immigrants stormed a UK-bound P&O ferry in the port of Calais, France, on Wednesday . Desperate immigrants have been trying to scale fences in Calais in an attempt to flee  as the chaos continues . More than 80 police officers and 40 riot police have been drafted in to Calais to help contain the crowds . Jean-Marc Puissesseau, of the Calais Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which runs the port, described the situation as 'unacceptable' and said the port is 'under siege'. He said: 'I demand that the forces of law and order have a permanent presence at the port as quickly as possible. 'It is out of order what is going on. If it is not sorted out we must close the port.'","Man spotted clinging to bottom of caravan as it travelled along M20 in Kent .

"By . Louise Cheer for Daily Mail Australia . Complete with a treetop suspension bridge, a fireman's pole and its own creek, a Queensland treehouse is a dream come true for the inner child of every potential buyer. Constructed with 26 different types of timber, The Gulch in the Whitsundays' Gregory River incorporates owners Owen and Irene Bailey's love of wood and their rainforest surroundings. The wooden benchtops seen in the house's uniquely built kitchen were a 'labour of love' and handcrafted by Mr Bailey. The treehouse property is located on Gleneva Drive in Gregory River in Queensland's Whitsundays and is called The Gulch . A treetop suspension bridge is one of the house's most striking features and is built over the top of a creek that runs through the property . The Gulch has 'slowly evolved' into what it is today over 18 years - when the Baileys first purchased the five-acre parcel of land . Some of the timber that features in The Gulch was sourced from the Whitsundays Islands. 'I collected, stored and milled the timber from my work, knowing one day we would incorporate these special pieces in our home,' he told Ray White Whitsunday real estate agent Michael Barr. 'The kitchen was a labour of love, handcrafting a lot of the benchtops as well as the architraves and the doors.' The Gulch has 'slowly evolved' into what it is today over 18 years - when the Baileys first purchased the five-acre parcel of land. The pool inside the house is meant to resemble a lagoon which adds to the tranquil and laidback atmosphere of the treehouse . Imitating the wooden interior, the outdoor entertainment has the master craftmanship seen inside and allows residents to be exposed to the natural surroundings . The house has an open with the living areas running into the kitchen area, with all the eves and architraves handcrafted by owner Owen Bailey . The property sits on five acres of land that Owen Bailey bought in 1994 while he was a treelopper and used to do landscaping . The creek running between the main building and the pool - which has its own timber entertainment deck - is where the treehouse gets its name. A gulch is a deep valley that has been formed by water erosion. People can traverse the creek via a suspension bridge which is elevated in the treetops. To keep with the tranquil atmosphere of the house, the pool was designed to resemble a natural lagoon and has its own undercover seating and kitchen area. Attached to the outdoor area has a standalone toilet, and the house also has a large workshop area and various man-made dams. The property is owned by Owen and Irene Bailey who wanted to integrate the house's natural surroudings and Mr Bailey's passion for timber . Attached to the outdoor area is a standalone toilet, and the house also has a large workshop area and various man-made dams . Most of the house's features were done by Mr Bailey who bought the land 18 years ago when he was 27 . Inside, the house has an open floor plan with the living room running into the kitchen and the bedroom. Irene Bailey told Daily Mail Australia her husband was the one who designed it and oversaw its building. 'Owen was the initiator of the property. He bought the acre in 1994 as a subdivision,' she said. 'He was into timbers, he was a treelopper at the time and used to do landscaping and he was really into the forest and went bushwalking. 'He wanted a property that integrated all of that. 'He just fell in love with the property because it had a deep ravine and he knew it transform in the wet season.' Ms Bailey said her husband's love of wood was seen throughout the house. 'We have a bed backboard that looks like it has clouds on it,' she said. 'He built it with the idea to draw me in I think, he built it with love, and it worked - we got married in 2002.' The house was built to the couple's needs, including workspace areas for Owen's timber work and Irene's pottery . Construction for the house started in 2002 and Mr Bailey had help constructing it from a friend who was a registered builder . Ms Bailey said they thought they would never relocate but as a grower of native trees, the property would not allow the couple to expand their nursery business. 'We want someone to really love it and take it to the next level. Really focus it and make it what it needs to be,' she said. The Gleneva Drive property will go under the hammer on September 29. Ray White Whitsunday real estate agent Michael Barr said property in the Gregory River area had sold between $400,000 to $800,000, but it was difficult to put a price on a unique house such as The Gulch. 'When I was evaluating the house I brought a catalogue of 100 other properties on the market, but no one house matched it,' he said/ . 'You can't put a price on the quality of the work and the design.' The outdoor area has a standalone toilet, and the house also has a large workshop area and various man-made dams . A natural watercourse runs through the house, which flows down nearby mountains and is surrounded by valley . Houses in the area have sold for between $400,000 to $800,000 but real estate agent Michael Barr said the house was unique so it was hard to put a price on it . Mr Barr said the most striking feature of the house for him was the suspension bridge over the creek. 'I’ve never seen a suspension bridge in someone’s house before, but for others probably the most striking feature would be the craftsmanship,' he said. 'When you look at the quality of what [Owen's] done it’s pretty special. 'His attention to detail and the way he’s formed the timber and polished it, he’s tried to keep the natural features of the wood.'","The treehouse with two bedrooms is located on Gleneva Drive at Gregory River in Queensland's Whitsundays .

"By . Richard Spillett for MailOnline . A fifth of all child and teenager deaths in England could be prevented, according to damning series of reports. Researchers have found that a large proportion of the 5,000 infants, children and adolescents who die  in England and Wales each year could be saved. A series of papers published in medical journal the Lancet has found that, although the child death rate in England is low relative to population size, too many youngsters are being let down by doctors or social services. The number of preventable deaths in England has been branded a 'wake up call for healthcare professionals' One paper showed that between 2010 and 2011, 20% of deaths of children and teenagers aged 18 and under in England could have been avoided. Deaths that could have been prevented include many among newborn babies, youngsters with existing medical conditions and others killed by infections. Dr Hilary Cass, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: 'We've known for some time that the UK performs badly compared to its western European counterparts when it comes to child mortality rates. 'But this paper reveals the startling fact that one in five child deaths in England could be prevented. This is a serious wake-up call for both healthcare professionals and policy-makers and we have to act urgently.' President of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health Hilary Cass says the figures show policy-makers have to act urgently to save children . Preventable deaths were defined as 'those in which modifiable factors may have contributed to death' with causes including accidents, suicide, deliberately-inflicted injury, abuse or neglect, and acute medical conditions. One of the papers found clear regional differences in child death rates around England and Wales. They tended to be higher in the Midlands and the North than in the South and East. The one exception was the North East, where death rates were relatively low. Lead researcher Peter Sidebotham, from the University of Warwick, said: 'What these variations in mortality tell us is that more could be done to prevent child deaths across all age groups. 'Although some contributing factors are relatively fixed, including a child's age, sex, and genetics, many environmental, social, and health service factors are amenable to interventions that could lessen risks and help prevent future deaths.' For children aged one to four, the number of deaths per 100,000 of the population ranged from around 15 in the South East to 23 in the North West. Among children aged five to 14, the rate varied between around eight per 100,000 in the East and South East to 10 in the North West and East Midlands. Dr Sidebotham added: 'It needs to be recognised that many child deaths could be prevented through a combination of changes in long-term political commitment, welfare services to tackle child poverty and healthcare services.'","Around 5,000 children and adolescents die  in England and Wales each year .

The British and Irish team completed a full tour Down Under just a year ago - culminating in an epic 2-1 Test series triumph. Ordinarily, they would not return to Australia for another 12 years, in 2025, but the ARU are attempting to accelerate their next visit. Last year's tour featured a warm-up match against the Barbarians in Hong Kong as a stop-off on the journey south. Sam Warburton raises the Tom Richards Cup aloft after the Lions won the 2013 Test series in Australia . The Lions are thought to be considering a similar fixture in 2017 and the Australians have made contact to raise the possibility of that game taking place on their shores. ARU chief executive, Bill Pulver, said: 'That's one of the conversations we've been having with them (Lions officials). If they want preliminary games outside New Zealand then we would be a wonderful location for them. We would take it in a heartbeat.' While the prospect of a match between the Lions and the Wallabies is unlikely in the midst of a Super Rugby season, alternative options are being discussed. Australian Rugby Union chief executive Bill Pulver (right) is keen to bring the Lions back Down Under in 2017 . The ARU would be desperate to land the fixture as a source of considerable revenue, at a time when they are struggling both financially and in terms of public support. Last weekend, a meagre crowd of 15,000 attended the Test between Australia and Argentina on the Gold Coast. The lack of June tours next year, ahead of the World Cup, will cause further monetary problems. The Lions were heavily criticised for their stop-off in Asia last year, when players had to contend with extreme levels of humidity to fulfil a fixture which was widely seen as being a commercial exercise to satisfy sponsors HSBC - who are based in Hong Kong. Australia's Bernard Foley makes a break during the Test match against Argentina in Gold Coast last weekend . It also reflected a lack of suitable opposition in Australia, whereas New Zealand could provide a greater spread of meaningful warm-up matches.

"By . Becky Barrow, Business Correspondent For The Daily Mail . Concerns: Frances O'Grady spoke of a pay gap . A generation of young graduates are stuck in low-paid jobs such as working as baristas in coffee shops, the Trades Union Congress leader warned yesterday. Frances O’Grady voiced fears about the ‘generational pay gap’ between older workers and their children and grandchildren. She said it was ‘clearly’ wrong to suggest older people were over-paid, but ‘it doesn’t look like a very bright future’ for a generation of young workers trapped in dead-end jobs. Graduates under 25 are doing jobs that are ‘well below their talent’ following ‘a shift away from the jobs and industries which used to pay well to these low-paid service sector jobs,’ she added. Last year, more than 1,700 people applied for just eight jobs at a new Costa Coffee shop in Nottingham, which paid between £6.10 and £10 an hour. Miss O’Grady said: ‘Many young people will end up as a barista who in the past would have ended up in a manufacturing job – high quality, high value, good prospects. That is not the case if you are a barista.’ Her comments came after the Employment Minister insisted young people should be prepared to take lowly jobs in the service industry and work their way up. Esther McVey said: ‘You could be working at Costa. But in a couple of years’ time you might say, “I’d like to manage the area”, or might even want to run a hotel in Dubai.’ Miss O’Grady’s comments came ahead of the TUC’s annual conference, which begins on Sunday. She also took the opportunity to slam wealthy politicians, saying many have ‘a touch of the Marie Antoinette’ and cannot understand the plight of ordinary Britons. Many members of the Cabinet attended top public schools, including the Prime Minister, who went to Eton College, and the Chancellor, who went to St Paul’s. Miss O’Grady, who attended a grammar school which became a comprehensive, and earns a basic salary of £106,333, said: ‘I don’t personally care what background people come from ... but it does seem to me to be a failure of imagination to think that ordinary working people can keep taking pay cuts. ‘Some politicians need to get real and understand most of us don’t have an inheritance to rely on.’ A recent report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies said that since the Second World War, each generation has been wealthier than the previous one, but that this trend ‘may be coming to a halt’.","Frances O'Grady voiced fears of 'generational gap' causing dead-end jobs .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . The Kansas Supreme Court on Friday overturned the death sentences of two brothers convicted of killing four friends who were robbed and forced to engage in sex acts before being shot to death and left in a snow-covered Wichita field. The court also struck down three of the four capital murder convictions each against Jonathan and Reginald Carr, citing procedural problems at the brothers' joint trial for its decisions. It upheld one capital murder conviction for each of them. Prosecutors said the brothers broke into a Wichita home in December 2000 and forced the five people there to have sex with each other and later to withdraw money from ATMs. Two women were raped repeatedly before all five were taken to a soccer field and shot while they were kneeling. Four of them — 29-year-old Aaron Sander, 27-year-old Brad Heyka, 26-year-old Jason Befort and 25-year-old Heather Muller — died. Scroll down for video .

The Kansas Supreme Court on Friday, July 25, 2014 overturned the death sentences of the two brothers convicted of capital murder in a crime spree in Wichita in 2000 including robbery, rape, forced sex and four fatal shootings in a snow-covered soccer field. (AP Photo/Kansas Department of Corrections) One of the women survived a gunshot wound to the head and she ran naked through the snow to seek help. She became a key witness at the brothers' trial on the capital murder convictions. The killings ended a series of crimes that authorities alleged the Carr brothers committed over nine days in December 2000. The Kansas Supreme Court ruled 6-1 in overturning the Carr brothers' death sentences because the presiding judge did not hold separate sentencing proceedings for each man. In overturning most of their capital murder convictions, the majority said the instructions to jurors had been flawed because the judge tied those charges to the rape of the surviving victim, not the deceased ones. The brothers' cases will return to Sedgwick County District Court for further proceedings . Republican Gov. Sam Brownback and several GOP legislators were immediately critical of the decisions, which involved crimes that were among the most notorious in the state since the 1959 slayings of a western Kansas family that inspired the book In Cold Blood. The legislators said the ruling shows the court's unwillingness to uphold a death sentence, and the governor said he was stunned. 'They were convicted by a jury of their peers in front of an elected local judge,' Brownback said in a statement. 'Today's ruling unnecessarily reopens wounds of a tragic moment in Wichita's history.' Spared: Jonathan Carr looks around the courtroom during the first day of his murder trial in Sedgwick County District Court, Monday, Oct. 7, 2002, in Wichita, Kansas . Heyka's father, Larry Heyka, also expressed disappointment and said he was struggling to make sense of the rulings, which totaled nearly 480 pages. 'Hopefully going forward, we will all understand what these rulings really mean,' said Heyka, who is from Council Grove. Attorneys for the brothers did not return telephone messages seeking comment. Sedgwick County District Attorney Marc Bennett said he's not sure whether his office will appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, but he promised to continue pursuing death sentences. Jonathan Carr, now 34, and Reginald Carr, 36, were in their early 20s when the crimes occurred. Together, they were convicted of 93 counts, including rape, aggravated kidnapping and aggravated robbery. The state Supreme Court upheld a total of 57 convictions against them. Most of the overturned convictions involved the allegations of forcing their victims to engage in sex acts. Five other convicted killers remain on death row in Kansas. The state Supreme Court last week overturned the death sentence of Sidney Gleason in the killings of a Great Bend couple in 2004. Kansas last executed someone in 1965, by hanging. The current capital punishment law was enacted in 1994, but the state's highest court has yet to approve any death sentences.","Jonathan and Reginald Carr sentenced to death in 2002 for the 'Wichita Massacre'

"By . Richard  Shears . Australian ambulance officials warned iPhone owners today to be careful how they handle their devices after a Sydney woman was taken to hospital when she allegedly received an electric shock from her device. The incident follows what ambulance authorities said were hundreds of emergency calls for mobile phone shocks between January and June this year. Earlier this month the family of a Chinese woman said she had died after receiving an electric shock from her iPhone when she was using it while it was charging. The Apple initiative will take place from August 16 to October 18. Anyone who wants to take up the offer will have to provide the serial number of their iPhone, iPad or iPod, and hand over a USB charger . In the latest Australian incident, a woman in her 20s, from the Sydney suburb of Chatswood, was taken by ambulance to the Royal North Shore Hospital in a stable condition after allegedly receiving a shock from her iPhone. It is not known whether the phone was plugged into a charger at the time, but a spokeswoman said paramedics had responded to a number of shocks from mobile phone chargers this year. New South Wales Ambulance has attended 232 emergency calls for electric shocks in the first six months of this year, Sydney's Daily Telegraph reported. The spokeswoman said mobile phone users should keep an eye on their phone's connection. 'If the appliances are dusty, they should be given a vacuum clean,' she said, suggesting that dust could get into the terminals and cause a short circuit. Inspector John Brotherhood of the ambulance service warned that a slight shock could cause serious health problems. Tragic: Ma Ailun, 23, a former flight attendant with China Southern Airlines, died when she picked up her iPhone as it charged at home, her family said. 'It takes only a small shock to interfere with your heart,' he said. 'Basically, if the jolt moves you, if it takes your breath away or if it's at all a cause for concern, you need to get it' - referring to a person's health and also the phone - 'checked out.' Earlier this month air stewardess Ma Ailun was killed by an . electric shock when she answered a call on her iPhone 5 while it was . recharging, it was claimed yesterday. News . of the death of  23-year-old was posted on the internet by her sister, . prompting criticism of Apple among the country’s millions of iPhone . users. ‘I want to warn everyone else not to make phone calls when your mobile phone is recharging,’ her sister wrote.

Her sister then wrote on social networking site Weibo: 'I want to warn everyone else not to make phone calls when your mobile phone is recharging.' She said Ma had bought the iPhone in December at an official Apple store . and was using the original charger to recharge the phone when the . incident occurred.

The shocking video shows one man being whacked while lying down in the back of a truck and another set upon by a vicious dog. Human rights groups have denounced the Fijian military over the footage, which some have described as 'torture'. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Beating: Video footage of Fijian soldiers apparently tormented prisoners has appeared online . Cruel: The video shows a dog trying to maul one of the prisoners with the soldiers' encouragement.

The video shows men in plain clothes speaking Bauan, a Fijian dialect, hitting handcuffed prisoners with large sticks and laughing while they are tormented by a dog. The footage was said to date back to an incident last year when five escaped were beaten by police after being recaptured.

Champagne, 56, is a former diplomat who joined FIFA in 1999, serving as an executive for 11 years. Frenchman Jerome Champagne has confirmed his intention to run for FIFA presidency . Sepp Blatter last week announced that he would definitely stand for a fifth term as president . Since leaving the world governing body in 2010 he has advised various football federations and was football commissioner for the World Festival of Black Arts in Dakar. Champagne confirmed his candidacy in a letter posted on his website, which read: 'I have the honour of informing you that I have just written to the FIFA Ad-hoc Electoral Committee and its president, Mr Domenico Scala, to confirm my intention to run for FIFA president. 'On a personal level, I am happy that the debate about the future of FIFA and football has finally begun with the prospect of various candidates. 'First and foremost, debating about issues is a normal process in an institution based on democratic principles. Then, this debate is particularly indispensable for football.

Champagne went on to call for FIFA to be more democratic, inclusive and receptive to its member organisations, while he has also proposed public and televised debates to be held between all the candidates. He added: 'The 2015 election must not be determined on the basis of individual appeal but on vision and agenda, to which we must commit for the next decade, and the willingness and ability to diligently execute a programme that has been agreed to by the invested parties. 'The next 10 years will be crucial for football and very particularly for FIFA, which is at a crossroads and in need of sweeping changes that must take it further than what has been accomplished to date.'

"By . Katie  Davies . A Washington Post photograph has been disqualified after winning a prestigious photography prize after it emerged it broke the rules by being heavily photo-shopped. The image, taken by the newspaper's staff photographer Tracy Woodward, won the sports feature section of the White House News Photographers Association (WHNPA) ‘Eyes of History’ contest for its depiction of a high school wrestling champion in Virginia at the moment he won. However, the newspaper discovered the dramatic image had been edited from its original format prompting the picture editor to alert the authorities and have it withdrawn - after it had been handed a top prize. Unedited: This is the version of the photograph entitled State Champion which appeared in print. It shows the referee and the audience watching behind . Where's the ref: In the version submitted for the prize the referee is much less noticeable. Photo-shopping in such a way is against the rules of the prestigious prize . The newspaper founded in 1877 said it has strict editorial guidelines on the use of photo-shop, and although the picture appeared in its unedited form in the paper, they said their rules extend to competition entries made by members of staff. Photo-shopping in such a way was also barred in the competition entry rules. Photography Director MaryAnne Golon told the magazine News Photographer: 'A Washington Post photographer entered an altered photograph to the . WHNPA contest. 'Once Post editors saw that it had been altered from what . had originally been published in The Post, we withdrew the photo from . consideration. The Post's ethics policy prohibits the manipulation of . photographs, and we have taken action in accordance with that policy."" Woodward, who has worked at the paper for 16 years, is believed to have submitted 'State Champion' into the contest of his own accord. The two pictures, when presented side-by-side, clearly show the changes that have taken place. Embarrassing admission: Editors at the Post informed the competition authorities that their staff photographer had made photo-shop changes to his winning entry that breached the rules . The print version of the picture features a referee in the background of the dramatic shot while the competition entry has the figure of the referee blacked-out making him hard to notice and the wrestler more noticeable in the foreground. WHNPA president Ron Sachs's issued a statement on Monday saying the photograph was 'digitally manipulated in violation of the contest rules'. 'When we became aware of the altered image, the photo was immediately . disqualified in accordance with our published contest rules,' he said. 'The rules state: The content of a photograph must not be altered in . Photoshop or by any other means. No element should be digitally added to . or subtracted from any photograph and the image must be a truthful . representation of whatever happened in front of the camera during . exposure. Retouching to eliminate dust and scratches is acceptable.' Disqualified: Washington Post photographer Tracy Woodward, left, has been removed from the White House News Photographers Association prize after it emerged his picture had been photo-shopped . 'Reasonable adjustments in Photoshop are acceptable. These include . cropping, dodging and burning, conversion into grayscale, and normal . toning and color adjustments that restore the authentic nature of the . photograph. 'Excessive changes in density, contrast, color and . saturation levels that alter the original scene are not acceptable.

The forward showed no signs of a problem as he trained with the Chelsea squad this week but was left out of Jose Mourinho's 18-man squad on Tuesday which drew 1-1 with Schalke in their Champions League Group G opener when Klaas-Jan Huntelaar cancelled out Cesc Fabregas's controversial 11th-minute goal. And on Saturday the versatile attacker, who has recently recovered from a leg injury, was hooked from the action by Mourinho in favour of Ramires as Chelsea went to half-time against Swansea at 1-1. They were on level pegging only courtesy of a late Diego Costa equaliser, but went on to a 4-2 victory to maintain their perfect record as Costa added two more to his season's tally.

"By . Matt Barlow for MailOnline . Fulham have sacked boss Felix Magath following their poor start to the season and appointed Kit Symons as caretaker manager. The German had come under increasing scrutiny after a dismal start to the season that has left the Cottagers bottom of the Championship table with only one point from their opening seven games. Following a conference call held at the club on Thursday, which included US based owner Shahid Khan, a statement from the club said: . Fulham Chairman Shahid Khan has named Kit Symons as Caretaker Manager of Fulham Football Club and will personally and immediately lead a thorough search for the new First Team Manager of the Club. Felix Magath has been sacked as Fulham manager after a dismal start to the season . Fulham Under 21 manager Kit Symons will take over in a caretaker role while the club search for a new boss . Fulham have drawn one and lost six of their first seven games in the Championship so far this season . Symons, the Under 21 Manager at Fulham, replaces Felix Magath. Mr. Khan thanked Magath for his efforts through the final three months of last season in the Barclays Premier League and the first seven matches this season in the Sky Bet Championship. 'This is an unfortunate but necessary change,' Khan said. 'I am doing what I feel is right and needed for Fulham Football Club, for today as well as tomorrow. I thank our supporters for standing by us during these most difficult of times on the pitch, and promise better days ahead.' Khan was very reluctant to fire another manager, aware of his growing reputation for impatience spreading across the game after Fulham’s problems last season but felt it was important that a swift change was made. The American has now sacked three managers - Martin Jol,  Rene Meulensteen and Magath - since taking over the club in July 2013. For him, the bottom line was dismal results, a worrying trend of being unable to hang onto leads and a growing number of heavy defeats. Owner Shahid Khan has now sacked three managers in little over a year since taking over in July 2013 . Magath was backed in the transfer market, including the surprise £11m signing of Ross McCormack (L) All this after he backed Magath in the transfer market and bought the players he demanded. The rapid turnover of managers has however become part of the problem at the club, with the different players identified by different managers and subsequently unwanted. Fulham will be determined to make the right appointment for their highly-rated academy and a manager they think can plot a return to the Barclays Premier League while developing some of the exciting talent produced through the youth ranks. At the same time, apart from being the hottest seat in London at the moment, the job will appeal to many managers. Former Celtic boss Neil Lennon is among the early favourites. It is well located in the capital with a top-grade training base, successful youth department and it is financially stable, with a billionaire owner, even if previous managers will not recommend the post in terms of job security.

"By . James Rush . Aleisha Worrell falsely claimed to police that she had been abducted, tied to a lamppost and raped . A 20-year-old woman has been jailed for making up a false report claiming she was kidnapped, tied naked to a lamppost and raped. Aleisha Worrell lied to police that innocent Sean Hibberd had abducted her for a brutal sexual assault. A court heard how Mr Hibberd, 35, was held in custody for nine hours for 'intimate' physical examinations in the rape investigation. But Worrell confessed she was lying after detectives discovered her evidence was 'full of holes'. She said she wanted revenge on Hibberd because he was 'harassing' her boyfriend in a neighbourhood feud. Worrell told officers she had been abducted by a masked man before being tied to a lamppost.She claimed she was raped and left for three hours before being released. Prosecutor David Pugh said Worrell contacted the emergency services last December saying she had been abducted. Mr Pugh said: 'She claimed he had taken her to a road junction where he stripped her and himself, raping her as she remained tethered to the lamppost. 'He had then dressed and left her tied up for three hours before returning to free her. 'She then claimed that she had been dizzy when she had arrived at the police station after he had injected her with something after the alleged rape.' Mr Hibberd was arrested at 2.55am and underwent investigation. He was 'intimately examined' by a female police doctor at Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales. Police spent 14 hours investigating the allegations before realising she had been lying because her story was 'full of holes.' The court heard that not only was the area well lit but there were workmen nearby who would have had a clear view. Mr Hibberd (left) was held in custody for nine hours for 'intimate' physical examinations following the claims. Worrell (right) confessed she was lying after detectives discovered her evidence was 'full of holes' When confronted Worrell broke down to say: 'It’s all lies. I made it up because Sean was harassing me and my boyfriend and the police did nothing to him.' Worrell’s lawyer Clare Fear said: 'She is extremely sorry for the effect on Mr Hibberd and appreciates the severity of her position.' Worrell, from Merthyr Tydfil, admitted perverting the course of justice and was sent to a young offender’s institution for 18 months. Judge Eleri Rees told her: 'The wider issue is that you made the position of those who have truly been raped much more difficult. 'Make the most of the assistance given to you and the education available and you will come out more mature and more sensible and will never offend again.'","Aleisha Worrell told police she was raped and left for three hours .

"By . Anne Atkins . Recently, I tried to book my 11-year-old daughter Rosalie on the Eurostar to Paris. She’s off for a week-long trip to stay with a family friend who’s studying at college there and couldn’t be more excited. Our friend Emma would have met her at the Gare du Nord, and, while she speaks only a little French, if Rosalie had run into any problems she could always have called me on her mobile. But her plans were thrown into jeopardy when Eurostar flatly refused to let me buy her a ticket. Scroll down for video . Off on an adventure: Rosie, aged 11, has been travelling alone since a young age . The problem? She was to travel there alone and, no matter how mature and competent we, her parents, deem her to be, that’s against their rules. Apparently, she’s too young, by nearly a year. I tried to remonstrate with the manager. ‘She’s been taking trains on her own for years,’ I told her. ‘Not safely,’ she retorted. And she’s not the only person who seems to think I’m irresponsible to let my daughter travel abroad alone. I know other parents insist that, by fostering Rosie’s independence and encouraging her to travel to the Continent on her own, I’m flinging her in the path of every paedophile in Europe. This wasn’t the first time we’d bundled Rosie off to a foreign land on her own. Foreign land:  Rosalie Atkins, now 11, travelled to Lyons on her own . Eurostar may insist we should mollycoddle youngsters, but British Airways takes a far more sensible approach. Rosie has already flown to Lyons in France. And not only was she alone, she was just nine at the time. What’s more, she didn’t even have a mobile telephone — and we were comfortable that she only used the landline to ring home once or twice a week. She neither knew the French exchange family she was going to stay with, nor could she speak a word of the language. However, she was keen to go and my husband and I agreed that it would be good for her. She flew with British Airways, who have a Skyflyer Solo service for unaccompanied children, and we booked a spare seat for her harp. She loved it. The French exchange family picked her up from the airport and she had a wonderful holiday. When I told the Eurostar manager that Rosie frequently travels by train on her own, I sensed she was considering whether to report me to the police — and perhaps you are too. Terrible mother? Many have condemned Anne . After all, when I wrote about this subject for Mail Online earlier this week, some of the readers left me in no doubt they thought I was crazy. ‘What a terrible mother,’ was the gist of many of the kinder comments. ‘A disaster waiting to happen,’ declared one man, while another urged: ‘Take her kids off her. For their own safety.’ If they only knew what else I and my husband have let our five children do on their own, no doubt they’d be even more horrified. All our children — Serena, Lara, Alexander, Benjamin and Rosie— have been young adventurers. I believe letting children be independent could actually make them safer in the long run. It’s been a deliberate policy to let them travel alone from as young as possible — not because I want to save time for me, but to give them reserves of confidence and chutzpah that would carry them into successful and interesting futures. And, before you say this must be for my own convenience, I’ll have you know that I spent two terms teaching my eldest daughter Serena how to bicycle the two miles to senior school aged 11 and the same amount of time teaching Rosie to walk to school. How much easier would it have been to accept my father’s kind offer to drive her there every day for us! It’s simply nonsense to suggest I’m endangering my children by doing this. In fact, I’d have done it sooner if I’d been able. All of us in the family wanted Rosie to walk to school (all of 20 yards away, watched by us from the doorstep) when she was five, but the school insisted we accompany her. That’s why, when we moved from Oxfordshire to Bedford a year later, I made it clear to the new headmistress that Rosie would be walking in on her own. Independent: 'I like the fact that my parents trust me. It also prepares your child for adulthood' says Rosie . It was less than a mile, mostly through a pedestrianised shopping centre and finishing along a traffic-free path by the river. When my own father expressed mild surprise, I pointed out that he had crossed town alone to school from the tender age of seven. I walked to school alone aged five. All the evidence shows that no more children are snatched off the streets by paedophiles now than 50 years ago. All that has changed is traffic. And, critically, our perception of danger. Extraordinarily, other parents complained to the headteacher — Rosie wasn’t safe they said, perhaps thinking she might fall in the river, be run over, raped or abducted, but the head backed up our right to do what we thought best, despite the criticism. The next year, Rosie went on the bus to visit her sister Lara in Cambridge. We put her on at one end, alerted the driver to her presence, and Lara met her at the other. She also visited Serena in London, who would do the same at St Pancras, the East Coast manager having upgraded Rosie to First Class to keep an eye on her. Young adventurers: Rosalie prepare some homemade treats in the kitchen with her French exchange family . So when she was offered the opportunity to try out for a music scholarship and a choristership at Durham Chorister School 200 miles away, 18 months ago, she went. Alone. For a week. She was successful in her endeavours and started last September without me or her father ever having visited the place. Nowadays, she capably manages railway stations and journey changes she has never encountered before. If things aren’t running to schedule, she has no qualms about borrowing the train manager’s telephone (she seldom remembers to charge hers) to alert us or her sisters to her whereabouts. Some people may be horrified that she’ll happily walk up to a strange man and talk to him, but I think it’s brilliant she’s got the confidence to be able to do so — choosing a man in uniform because she knows he’s there to help her. ‘I like the fact that my parents trust me,’ she said recently. ‘It prepares you for adulthood.’ Time to grow up: Anne believes the idea of children travelling alone is more scary for the adult . Indeed it does. Our children — who, except for Rosie, are now in their twenties — have been all over the world without us, including Thailand, the Palestinian West Bank and Madagascar. Being allowed to travel alone has taught them confidence, independence and risk management . What’s more, statistics show a child is more likely to be killed inside a car than out. And cyclists — such as my children and I — live longer because it makes for a healthier lifestyle. The reason more parents do not allow their children to travel alone may be more about them than the safety of their offspring. We want to feel we are doing everything to keep our children safe, that we have a vital role and that they need us. But by doing this, we can actually keep them unnaturally immature and prevent them learning to be safe for themselves. That’s why I believe my way could actually be safest. It just feels more scary for the adult. Waving your six-year-old child goodbye as she walks to school on her own for the first time is terrifying. Much easier to get in the car. But that first day has to come sooner or later and, provided it is done responsibly and sensibly, sooner can really be better. Maybe it’s time for us adults to grow up and start acting in a way that’s best for our children rather than for ourselves.","When Anne Atkins tried to buy her daughter Rosie a train ticket to Paris, Eurostar refused because she was travelling alone .

"By . William Turvill . Oxford University has been accused of 'betraying' alleged victims of sexual assault by hushing up allegations made against students and members of staff. More than a dozen men and women have described a 'culture of silence' preventing them from reporting claims of sex attacks and rapes. The collection of claims have been compiled in a booklet created by the Oxford University Student Union. Oxford University has been accused of 'betraying' alleged victims of sexual assault by hushing up their reports . The editor of the booklet, in an unsigned foreword, describes the collection as representing a ‘whole spectrum of feelings from antagonism, anger and frustration to sadness, guilt and betrayal towards the university and its services’. According to The Times, the union’s vice-president for women, Sarah Pine, said that while there had been ‘positive steps’ made by the university since the booklet was published last autumn, some staff continue to hold the wrong attitudes. She said that the ‘overriding response’ appeared to be that ‘those in positions of responsibility mediated by the university have had some victim-blaming views’. She said some of the colleges had ‘very badly’ and that ‘intellectualism’ could get the better of humane instincts. More than a dozen men and women have described a 'culture of silence' preventing them from reporting their claims of sexual assault (stock picture) A university spokesman said: ‘Oxford has always taken complaints of harassment very seriously. It has a policy and procedures in place to help students make complaints in all such cases, including sexual harassment and assault. 'While the OUSU publication referred to is now out of date, the University’s culture has always been one of offering comfort and support to victims. 'We are committed to continually educating our staff and students on how best to offer relevant and sensitive support, working closely with OUSU on this.' The spokesman said the university has more than 270 'training harassment advisors' offering 'immediate support'. They added: 'The benefit of Oxford’s collegiate system is that students live and study in small communities offering a close and supportive environment. 'In instances of sexual harassment or violence, welfare teams, peer supporters and harassment advisors based in the colleges, are on hand to offer immediate support to students. 'They will always support students who report  sexual violence and would encourage them to report those allegations, which are a criminal matter, to the police.’","More than a dozen men and women have described the 'culture of silence'

"By . Chris Spargo for MailOnline . k.d. Lang appears to have a new lady love in her life, and it is very safe to say that she is not after the singer's money. The 52-year-old 'Constant Craving' crooner is reportedly dating Heather Edwards, the wife of Canadian oil and gas tycoon N. Murray Edwards, who is estimated to be worth a staggering $2.2 billion. Mrs. Edwards and her husband split over a year ago, though the two are still not divorced. Scroll down for video . Billionaires: Heather Edwards (right), who is married to N. Murray Edwards (left), an oil and gas tycoon worth $2.2 billion, is reportedly dating singer k.d. Lang . Past love: Lang (left) ended her domestic partnership with Jamie Price (right) in 2012, after eight years together . Lang dissolved her domestic partnership with ex Jamie Price, who she had been with for eight years, in 2012. According to the online magazine Frank, Lang and her new paramour are 'often seen together, dining out at Calgary’s swell eateries, sometimes accompanied by Heather’s son.' Page Six reports that the two 'share a passion for Buddhism and sushi.' Self-made: Mr. Edwards (left) made his money in gas and oil before branching out into other arenas, while Lang (right) shot to fame in the early nineties with her singing career . A lawyer-turned-financier who is notoriously media shy,  Mr. Edwards, 54, made his money through investments in Canadian oil and mining companies, owning stakes in Ensign Energy, Canada's second biggest oil services company, and Penn West, one of Canada's biggest energy trusts. He also owns and manages numerous resorts and hotels through his company Resorts of the Canadian Rockies and is a co-owner of the Calgary Flames hockey team. Forbes ranks him as the 859th richest man in the world.

Mr. and Mrs. Edwards met in in 2002, when she was director of communications for then Natural Resources Minister Herb Dhaliwal. Since then, Mrs. Edwards has focused on philanthropic work, a full time job given how much money the couple have donated. They recently gave $5 million for a 14-bed neonatal intensive care unit at the Alberta Children’s Hospital earlier this year, a cause that hit close to home for the parents as their son needed neonatal intensive care when he was born eight weeks early. Despite their split, it seems the two still work closely on their charitable endeavors. Lang, a Grammy Award-winning artist, shot to international fame in the early nineties thanks to critical acclaim and album sales in the millions. Famous exes: Lang previously had relationships with Julie Cypher (left) who went on to date Melissa Etheridge, and Leisha Hailey (right) of The L Word .

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . Michael Miller, who faces 10 years in jail for assaulting a homeless man he invited into his house and had a threesome with his wife with . An ex-marine faces up to 10 years in jail after assaulting a homeless man he had invited into his home to have a threesome with his wife. Martin Miller, 30, and his wife Daniela, 24, had brought homeless 20-year-old Michael Chaney into their house and had a threesome with him, before things took a nasty turn. Mrs Miller and the homeless man continued to stay intimate for three days after the threesome without Mr Miller's knowledge, a Bay City, Michigan court heard - and things blew up when Mr Chaney offered to cook hamburgers for them all. The married couple were in the bathroom, with Mrs Miller in the tub, when Mr Chaney brought up some burger meat for them to taste. Mr Miller tossed the meat into the bath - and did the same again when his guest returned with more. Mr Chaney told him to stop wasting food and left the room, so Mr Miller followed him and told him he would beat him up. Mr Chaney told him to go ahead. Mr Miller then kicked him in the chest, pushed his wife away and then choked him, telling him he was going to kill him, court records say. He blacked out, and when he awoke, Mrs Miller walked him to the hospital, the homeless victim told the court. 'Martin became jealous after we had a threesome because Daniela started to distance herself from him,' said Mr Chaney, as reported by mlive.com. In his defence, Mr Miller said: 'I am a marine. When someone challenges me I go into kill mode,' while adding that Mr Chaney was being an 'a**hole'. The catalyst: Michael Chaney was cooking burgers for the Millers, and brought some of the meat up to the bathroom where they were for them to taste. Mr Miller then threw it in the bath and attacked him . He claims that he could not remember if he had kicked Mr Chaney and admitted to strangling him, but said throwing the burger meat in the bath was a joke. He has been charged with one count of assault by strangulation, and could go to prison for up to 10 years and be fined $5,000 if found guilty. Police were sent to the McLaren Bay Region hospital emergency room, near to the Millers' Bay City home, at about 11.44pm last Friday. There, Mr Chaney told officers he had been living with the Millers for about a week before the attack, and that Mr Miller became jealous of him after their threesome. Mrs Millers backed up Mr Chaney's description of the events, while Mr Miller also confirmed many of them. He said that Mr Chaney called his bluff when he had threatened to beat him up, and questioned his wife as to why she had taken the homeless man's side. Polce then arrested him. At court on Monday, Mr Miller told Bay County Chief District Judge Timothy Kelly that he had served in the U.S. Marine Corps between 2002 and 2005, before receiving honourable discharge. He suffers from bipolar disorder, and now receives social security income.","Martin Miller, 30, had invited Michael Chaney to live with him and his wife .

"By . Richard Spillett . Support for Andy Murray's mother, Judy, on Strictly Come Dancing could nose-dive following her son's intervention in the Scottish referendum, fans say. The tennis star provoked anger by  backing independence in a message tweeted on the day of the historic vote on Britain's future. His tweet was attacked by Scottish supporters of the union, who pointed out that the 27-year-old player lives in Surrey and did not have the right to vote. It is thought anger with the former Wimbledon champion may now hit his mother's hopes of glory on BBC show Strictly Come Dancing. Scroll down for video . Judy Murray was hoping to become a hit on BBC's Strictly Come Dancing when it starts later this month . But of her and partner Anton Du Beke's chances may be hit by her son, Andy's, referendum tweet yesterday . Judy, 55, is dancing with the show's Anton Du Beke and the pair are currently getting ready for the first programme on September 26. It was thought Judy, who wore tartan trousers in some publicity photos ahead of the show, would play on her Scottish roots and dance to Mull of Kintyre. But she may be forced to rethink her plans after the outrage directed at her son following his decision to make his political views public. Fans of the show took to Twitter today to predict she would struggle against fellow competitors, who include popstar Pixie Lott, ex-rugby playerThom Evans and TV presenter Caroline Flack. Graham Smith tweeted: 'Somehow I think, similar to the #YES vote in the #indyef, Judy Murray's vote won't hold up in Strictly on Saturday.' And Ron Kane ‏added: 'So...The first act of an emboldened England will be to vote Judy Murray off Strictly then? #indyref' Judy was assigned Mr Du Beke as a partner  earlier this month and the pair are preparing for the first dance . Judy has worn tartan trousers ahead of her appearance on the show and may play on her Scots identity . Other Twitter users jokingly suggested that Andy, who was disparaging about his mother's chances on the show, may have intervened to stop her embarrassing him. Telling of the moment she told Andy she was going on the show, Judy revealed: 'Andy said: ""Oh my God, you'll be absolutely terrible"". And I think he probably will be right.' On Twitter yesterday, show fan Mike Ruddick wrote: '@andy_murray We see your cunning plan in that Yes vote tweet. It was to make sure that [Judy] gets eliminated in the first round of #SCD' Bookmakers currently have Judy at 20/1 to win the competition, well behind 10/3 favourite Pixie Lott. Andy had previously remained silent on the issue of independence but posted a message on Twitter just hours ahead of the polls opening yesterday. The tennis player caused anger with this tweet in which he suddenly professed his support for a Yes vote . Murray - who was not eligible to vote in the Scottish referendum - was seen playing at Wimbledon yesterday . He tweeted: 'Huge day for Scotland today! no campaign negativity last few days totally swayed my view on it. excited to see the outcome. lets do this!' His comments were met with abuse on the social media site, some of which is being investigated by police. Assistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins said: 'People who put abuse such as this online should be utterly ashamed of themselves for making such vile, disgusting and distasteful comments. 'We are monitoring social media and where appropriate will take action against those involved. 'Social media is important for many people but it must be used responsibly. There is no place for personal abuse of any kind on it.'","Former Wimbledon champion tweeted support for Yes vote yesterday .

"By . Tim Finan for Daily Mail . and Annabel Grossman for MailOnline . French gendarmes investigating the killing of a  retired British man at his home in Brittany are mystified by the absence of any trace of the bullet which passed through the victim's neck. Former guitarist Glenn Miller, 65, was found on Sunday morning lying in a pool of blood with gaping wounds in his neck where the bullet entered and exited, killing him instantly. But Gendarmes called to the scene after a neighbour found Mr Miller slumped in a corner of his dining room found no gun, bullet or cartridge and no evidence of an impact on furniture or the inside walls. Scroll down for video . Former guitarist Glenn Miller, 65, was found on Sunday morning lying in a pool of blood with gaping wounds in his neck where the bullet entered and exited, killing him instantly . A source close to the investigation said yesterday: 'What the Gendarmes and the investigators cannot understand is why there was absolutely no trace of the projectile which killed Mr Miller. 'The prosecutor announced that the cause of death was murder but there is no sign of any weapon or any sign of a bullet which was fired through the victim's neck. 'It caused a gaping wound and would have impacted or ricocheted within the murder room. 'There would have been marks on furniture or on the walls caused by a bullet fired from a gun powerful enough to cause the terrible wounds. 'The possibility that he was killed elsewhere has been ruled out given the huge amount of blood under and around the poor man's body.' Mr Miller lived alone in a restored granite farmhouse at the hamlet of Traon Bras near the small village of Plounevez- Lochrist, only a few miles from the Channel coast in northwest Brittany. Yesterday French forensic officers were again studying macabre footsteps in dried blood found in the dining room where the crime took place. They are convinced that the shoes or boots that left the prints were worn by the killer. The victim was wearing slippers at the time of his death and the neighbour who discovered the body left no traces as the blood in the room had dried. Investigators believe that Mr Miller was shot dead by an intruder who may have been intent on robbing the retired expat, although there were no signs of a struggle, according to prosecutor Eric Mathais. The visiting neighbour called police to the austere granite farmhouse at the hamlet of Traon Bras near the small village of Plounevez- Lochrist, only a few miles from the Channel coast in northwest Brittany . There was also no sign a of a break and at the time of the discovery the door of the house was open, he said. He revealed that the victim lived alone in the house in a state of extreme untidiness. A neighbour reportedly heard shouting coming from the murder house at 11pm on Saturday night. Villagers in Plounevez-Lochrist described Glenn Miller as a likeable man who was popular in the small community. He spoke little French but managed to communicate with locals in the bar. Mr Miller inherited the house where he lived alone from his uncle. His mother came from the village and his father was English. Prior to moving into the house four years ago Mr Miller had lived in Toronto, Canada, according to café owner Jacques Goguer, 51. 'His sister who was from England introduced him to us four years ago and said he was her brother,' he added. 'We got to know him well. He was from England had played in a band as a guitarist in Canada. 'He had lived here in his house for four years. He inherited the house from his uncle when he died. Glenn's mother was a local French woman from the village and his father was English. 'Latterly he had had a problem with his hand due probably to arthritis. He said he couldn't play guitar anymore because he couldn't move his fingers much. 'He didn't drink a lot and he didn't seem to have a girlfriend. He lived alone in the house.'","Glenn Miller, 65, found in a pool of blood  in his home on Sunday .

Dying wish: Tricia Somers (above) asked her nurse if she would take in her son after she died of liver cancer . Only child: Somers has no family members who could care for her eight-year-old son Wesley (above) Chance encounter: Nurse Tricia Seaman (above) was shocked when Somers asked her to raise Wesley . The two ladies met when Seaman cared for Somers after she underwent diagnostic tests at Pinnacle Health's Community General campus in Harrisburg. The day before she was set to be discharged, Somers dropped a bombshell when she asked the nurse to take in her son. 'She said, ""If I die will you raise my son?""' recalled Seaman. Somers' parents died years ago, and she felt no one in her family was capable of caring for her son. Seaman admits she was stunned, but quickly agreed after talking things over with her husband Daniel, who felt they should do all they could to help the young boy and his mother. As luck should have it, Seaman and her family had actually been in the process of becoming foster parents  and were already approved to be adoptive parents.

"By . Associated Press . Turkey's Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu today announced that 49 Turkish hostages held by Islamic militants have been freed (file picture) A group of 49 Turkish hostages who were seized by Islamic State militants in Iraq have been freed, the country's Prime Minister has announced. Ahmet Davutoglu said the captives, including diplomatic staff, has been released after they were seized from the Turkish Consulate in Mosul on June 11, . ISIS fighters captured the group three months when they overran the city as the terrorized parts of the country. He told Turkish reporters during a visit to Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, that the hostages were released early on Saturday and have safely arrived in Turkey. The politician said he was cutting his visit short to meet with the hostages in the province of Sanliurfa, near Turkey's border with Syria. He did not provide details on the circumstances of their release. 'I am sharing a joyful news which as a nation we have been waiting for,' Davutoglu said. 'In the early hours our citizens were handed over to us and we brought them back to our country.' 'They have crossed into Turkey and I am on my way to see them,' Davutoglu said. The seizure of the hostages had left Turkey, a member of the NATO military alliance and a key U.S. ally in the Middle East, hamstrung in its response to the threat from Islamic State fighters over its southern borders in Iraq and Syria. The United States is drawing up plans for military action in Syria against Islamic State fighters but Turkey had made clear it did not want to take a frontline role, partly because they feared for the fate of the hostages. ISIS took the Iraqi cities of Mosul, in Nineveh, and Tikrit in June and has announced an Islamic Caliphate in areas it controls in Iraq and Syria. This week it was reported that the extremists have created its own police force in Iraq with patrol cars, uniforms and even a jail as they continue to wreak havoc across the country. Mosul was one of the first cities captured by Islamic State militants as they terrorized Iraq. A fighter is seen waving the black ISIS flag in the middle of the street in June . When the 49 consular employees were captured, Turkish civil servants stood outside the Foreign Ministry in the Turkish capital Ankara, condemning those inside for 'abandoning' the group .

"By . Ruth Styles for MailOnline . When Ava Galley, now four, from Cheshire, was born, her mother Nichola, 35, just had enough time to glimpse a pair of eyes and a tiny nose before her new daughter was whisked away by nurses. By the time she next saw her daughter, she was in the midst of a tangle of wires as doctors frantically tried to work out what was wrong with the tiny baby and find a solution for her continual vomiting. But more than four years on, Nichola and the doctors are no wiser and while they have managed to fix Ava's heart problems, precisely what sort of genetic disorder she suffers from remains unknown. Rare: Nichola with her little daughter Ava who has a genetic disorder so rare, it doesn't even have a name . Enjoying life: Despite her condition, Ava has learned to walk with the aid of a walking frame . 'It was like a punch in the stomach . because we'd been given the all-clear from the amnio test,' says Nichola of the moment she discovered that her tiny baby wasn't the healthy daughter she had hoped for. 'The pregnancy . had been tortuous but we just thought she was going to be a very . small baby. We were in the recovery room and laughing and joking when the doctor came in. 'The . way the news was delivered to us… he walked into the room . with a nurse and delivered it so abruptly - even the nurse was shocked.' Convinced Ava wouldn't survive, doctors tried to prepare a devastated Nichola and her husband Paul for the worst but, much to the surprise of medics, the little girl clung on. Initially, the biggest challenge was working out how to feed her: with Ava unable to suck and prone to vomiting whenever she was given milk. 'She was poorly . and it turned out that every time they fed her, they were drowning her . because the milk was going straight to the chest, straight to the lungs,' remembers Nichola. 'It was a good four months before we got her home and she has spent pretty much the first three years of her . life were in hospital. This summer is the first that she hasn’t been in . and out all the time.' Despite her improving condition, Ava who suffers from microcephaly [an unusually small skull] in addition to the genetic disorder, is still unable to walk unaided, talk or feed herself. She also continues to vomit uncontrollably, which means she regularly suffers from chest infections and needs a special bed, a feeding pump and round-the-clock care from her mother who has been forced to give up a promising career to care for her. 'She still vomits and I never know quite . how much food to give her or whether her body is going to tolerate that . feed,' explains Nichola. Family: Ava with her big brother James, seven, who has also learned to live with his sister's genetic disorder . Tough: Ava requires round-the-clock care which means Nichola has been unable to return to work . Limited: Because Ava's condition is so rare, no one knows how long she will live - doctors estimated five . 'It's easier now we've got the feeding pump but before, with . gravity feeding, I would be there for an hour and I couldn’t leave her, . not to go to the toilet, to answer the door or for anything. 'Then, you’d . have to do it all over again. I was trapped. I was a proper prisoner in . my own home. Now with the pump, I programme it to put the food in over . an hour, although we still have to have vomit jugs around . the house.' Ava's condition has also had a huge impact on her older brother James, seven, who, says Nichola, has had to see things that a child should never have to. More difficult to deal with is the lack of facts. Not only do Nichola and husband Paul have no idea what exactly is wrong with their daughter, they have no idea of what the future for Ava will look like. Although doctors originally put her life expectancy at between three and five years, Nichola hopes that Ava will live longer. 'The prognosis has always been ""we don't . know"",' she says, sadly. 'Ava has microcephaly and that combined with . her chest infections has cut her life down a lot. 'She’s having fewer and . fewer chest infections which is good but if her skull stops growing, . then that's where we know that we won't have much time left with her. We're just ticking along at the minute.' Not that she has any regrets about learning to love her daughter which she admits, in a bid to protect herself, she tried hard not to do at first. 'I did try . not to fall in love with her [at first] because I thought we were going to lose . her,' she confesses. 'I never thought we'd bring her home. It did take me a long time to . let myself go and fall head over heels with her. I was trying to prepare . myself to let her go, sort of protecting myself.' Difficult though Ava's first four years have been, Nichola bubbles over with love for her daughter but says that she would have liked more help. 'No, I don't think we've had enough help,' she says. 'I . want to return to work. I had to give up a career. I spent four years in higher education . and I'm in debt with my student loan because I can’t pay it off. Grateful: Although no one knows how long Ava has, Nichola says she is grateful to have been able to know her . 'Instead, I work 24-hours a day caring for Ava. There is no rest from . that. I get eight hours a week support but finding respite care at the . right time such as on the school run is hard because they have families . of their own. 'It can be a nightmare on the school run if Ava's being . sick and I have to get to school to pick up James... Those are the times . when I would like some help.' She also says she has been less than impressed with the local council who, after refusing to pay for a specialist bed, offered to pay for a crash mat to place beside a regular one instead. 'She's on a feeding pump which is a long tangled wire,' explains Nichola. 'She’d fall out, trip over the wire, get tangled up or . bump into the wardrobe which could then fall down on her. 'In the end, the New Life charity . provided the bed that she's got. We are so very grateful to them for doing that. 'But you . feel like you're constantly begging for help and it's demoralising. I . don't want to be in this situation and begging for help. I’m just trying . to join in with life - everything is a bit hard to be honest.' Despite the challenges and uncertainty of life with Ava, Nichola is doing her best to be as positive as she can. 'You don't know how long . you've got with anybody do you?' she says.  It's hard knowing that Paul won't be . walking her down the aisle, that we’ll never go and get our hair done . together or talk about boyfriends - that hurts. 'But I'm . grateful that I've had the opportunity to get to know her.'

"By . Associated Press . and Snejana Farberov for MailOnline . A Massachusetts woman who made violent threats against Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey in what prosecutors called a 'persistent and malevolent' cyberstalking campaign has been sentenced to more than four years in prison. A federal judge in Boston also ordered Linda Louise Culkin, of Quincy, to pay Spacey $124,000 in restitution for the actor's bodyguards. The 55-year-old Culkin has been jailed since January 2012, meaning she has about 18 months left to serve. He can rest easy now: Kevin Spacey's female cyberstalker Linda Culkin, 55, was sentenced to more than four years in prison after she pleaded guilty to sending the actor letters filled with violent threats . She pleaded guilty in November to charges including mailing communications threatening to blow up, torture, shoot and disembowel Spacey, and sending false information regarding explosives. Spacey was not in court for Wednesday's sentencing. He said in an impact statement it was 'difficult to measure the degree of terror' he felt. On her part, Culkin apologized and blamed her actions on mental illness. In May, Kevin Spacey wrote a letter to a federal judge asking to imprison Linda Culkin. Terrified: The Oscar-winning star of House of Cards said in an impact statement it was 'difficult to measure the degree of terror' he felt . Spacey, 55, revealed that Culkin caused him 'eminent fear,' and asked that she remain in custody and 'undertake intense psychiatric treatment'. Culkin's lawyer in court documents said there was 'no evidence' her client intended to carry out any threats . Prosecutors said Culkin mailed menacing letters to the Academy Award winner and his business associates, including bomb threats sent to his Los Angeles office in 2009. The card was traced to Culkin's home, where feds found 'a picture of K.S. with his eyes blacked out and mouth scribbled out, his name written repeatedly in the margin' the Boston Herald reported. Other evidence concerning Spacey was found under rugs and inside the furniture, including in the 55-year-old woman's cat furniture. Disturbing tweets included a warning 'that the person would put a bullet in K.S.’s brain and then commit suicide' and one that 'K.S. would be disemboweled', according to an affidavit. Authorities also seized multiple copies of a page titled 'Killing Kevin Spacey’ with various messages, among them one that read: 'the only way this is gonna be over is when these lads out him 6 foot under.' The stalker's husband, Edward Culkin, had written to the judge saying that his wife suffered from depression as the result of a violent rape and should not be jailed. Speaking in court during her sentencing, Mrs Culkin said that she did not mean to be so ‘vindictive.’ However, she declined to shed light on the source of her apparent animosity towards Spacey, the Boston Herald reported. . ‘I was overzealous. I cop to that. I fully apologize to him,’ she said. ‘I didn’t mean it to be so harsh.’","Linda Culkin, 55, was ordered to pay Spacey $124,000 in restitution for his bodyguards .

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . A man suspected of murdering his six-year-old step-cousin has claimed that she seduced him before he raped her and stabbed her to death, police have said. Matthew Flugence, 20, allegedly told a detective that little Ahlittia North put a blanket on the ground behind an apartment block in Harvey, Louisiana before telling him she wanted to have sex. 'In his words, the little girl, she wanted to have sex with him,' Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office Detective Travis Eserman during a preliminary examination, the Times-Picayune reported. Flugence allegedly admitted to having sex with the girl on July 14 before stabbing her four times - in the abdomen and the neck - and then watching her fall back to the blanket, Eserman said. Scroll down for video . 'Confession': Matthew Flugence, left, said he was seduced by six-year-old Ahlittia North, right, before he stabbed her to death in Harvey, Louisiana in July. The girl's body was found two days later in a dumpster . 'He said he just watched her die,' Eserman testified in the hearing on Wednesday. After the alleged grisly killing, detectives said Flugence, who is the nephew of Ahlittia's step-father, carried on with his day, even attending a family birthday party. The little girl was reported missing when her mother Lisa North, 20, and stepfather Albert Hill, 46, . discovered she had vanished from her bedroom in Harvey. Three days later, her body was found wrapped in a blanket inside a garbage bag and dumped in a trashcan that was left out on the curb near to where she lived. Discovery: The girl's stabbed body was found three days later in a dumpster in the street near her home . Devastation: Lisa North, mother of the missing six-year-old girl, weeps after the body was found in July . The trashcan had previously been checked and nothing was found inside, but it was searched again after DNA tests showed that a pool of blood found nearby was that of the missing girl. Arrest: His brother Russell Flugence, pictured, said Matthew told him he had killed the girl . Flugence was arrested carrying a knife that he said he had used to kill the girl. Tests are still underway to determine if it was the murder weapon. Authorities noted issues with his four recorded statements; police told him there were bullet casings near her body and he claimed he shot the girl, but there were no gunshot wounds to her body. 'In his first statement, he says he shot . her,' Eserman testified. 'Then he goes into, ""I don't know how she was . hurt. There was just blood"".' Likewise, despite his claim that he had sex with the girl, an autopsy showed no evidence of sexual activity, the Times-Picayune reported. He also called the weapon both a pocket knife and a sword, police said. It is not yet clear whether defense attorneys will seek a mental evaluation for Flugence in a bid to avoid a death sentence. Evidence, including the knife and the blanket, is still being processd at the Sheriff's Office Crime Lab. After hearing the testimony, a judge ruled that Flugence should continue to be held on a charge of first-degree murder without bond. Missed: The girl's step-father is Flugence's uncle. He had looked after her several times before her death . Loved: A young neighbor places a toy at a memorial for Ahlittia outside her home in July . He also faces charges of sexual battery after allegedly sexually touching a 10-year-old relative in April or May of 2012. The girl revealed the incident the day Ahlittia was killed. Flugence's brother, Russell Flugence, 21, was also charged with failing to report a felony after he claimed that his brother told him he killed Ahlittia. He has pleaded not guilty. After her body was discovered in July, Ms . North told the Times-Picayune: 'They could have brought her back home, but they killed her and put her in a trash can.'","Matthew Flugence 'told police he raped Ahlittia North after she put down a blanket and said she wanted to have sex with him'

"By . Sam Greenhill . Overdose: Patrick McMullen began to slur his words during a Skype conversation with friends in which he confessed to taking three LSD tabs and 500mg of E . A teenager died of a drugs overdose in his bedroom as friends listened helplessly online over Skype, an inquest heard. Patrick McMullen, who hoped to study at Cambridge, had boasted of buying drugs from notorious illicit website Silk Road. The 17-year-old took 500mg of ecstasy and three LSD tablets while his parents were out for the day. Then he went online to chat with friends on internet call service Skype. One of them, Jack Salisbury, told the inquest Patrick had boasted of taking ecstasy and LSD, and taking ketamine that he purchased on Silk Road – where users can obtain anything from drugs to fake passports. Jack, 17, said: ‘There were four of us who started chatting on Skype. Patrick told us he had taken half a gram of ecstasy and three tabs of LSD. ‘He was also talking about taking ketamine which he had got from Silk Road. He began talking differently. He was saying, “This is high quality stuff”. He said, “I’m starting to feel the effects now”. ‘It became apparent he couldn’t hold a conversation – he wasn’t making any sense. It sounded like he was banging around the room then he went silent.’ Jack tried calling Patrick on his mobile phone, and raised the alarm when it went unanswered. ‘About 20 minutes later I told my mum and she called an ambulance,’ he said. An ambulance crew found Patrick dead on his bedroom floor at the family’s £250,000 semi-detached house in Puddletown, near Dorchester in Dorset. Patrick’s mother Collette, 50, told the inquest in Dorchester she knew her son was a drug user and had begged him to stop. Mrs McMullen, a director of engineering firm Babcock International, said: ‘I asked him to promise me he wouldn’t use drugs. He said he couldn’t do that. ‘He thought taking drugs was a way of expanding his mind. ‘Patrick had a view of drugs that was contrary to our family beliefs.’ She said Patrick – who had three older brothers and an older sister – was a ‘happy and witty boy with a good sense of humour’. ‘He had done well in his exams and was hoping to go to Cambridge or UCL,’ she said. ‘He was confident and could be obnoxious, but we thought it was just him being a typical teenager.’ Conversation: Patrick collapsed and died while talking to friends on Skype (file photo) Her son was ‘an independent and . confident 17-year-old’, she added, and she and her husband James, a . retired Merchant Navy captain, ‘never expected any issues or concerns’ as they left home that day. The . inquest heard Patrick was expelled in 2011 from the Thomas Hardye . School in Dorchester – rated outstanding by Ofsted – for dealing drugs . to another student. But he had moved to The Purbeck School in Wareham, and hoped to study computing at Cambridge.A post-mortem examination into the August 31 tragedy revealed that the cause of Patrick’s death was ecstasy toxicity. Sheriff . Payne, the Dorset coroner, ruled he died due to illicit drug abuse – . and warned users can never be sure what might happen.

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . Can you crowd-fund the hunt for a war criminal on the run deep in Africa's jungles? A Canadian adventurer with experiences in Afghanistan and Somalia wants to do just that: raise funds and take a small band of former soldiers to find Joseph Kony. Robert Young Pelton, whose plan has already drawn criticism from a pair of Africa experts, is the latest to join a line of private individuals and aid groups who are trying to corner the alleged mass murderer and members of his Lord's Resistance Army. Kony remains elusive despite the deployment by President Barack Obama in late 2011 of 100 U.S. special forces to aid the hunt - which is mostly carried out by Ugandan troops - and the efforts by myriad private groups. Robert Young Pelton, left, has launched a crowd-funding page in an attempt raise the funds to hire a small band of former soldiers and track down Ugandan terrorist and warlord Joseph Kony . Members of Uganda's Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) pictured in 2006 as their leader Joseph Kony met with a delegation of Ugandan officials and lawmakers and representatives from non-governmental organizations, in the Democratic Republic of Congo near the Sudanese border . The U.S. State Department said non-governmental groups and foundations ‘have played a critical role in bringing the LRA's atrocities to the world's attention and continue to play an important role... to end those atrocities.’ But while the U.S. military's Africa Command and the State Department both said they ‘appreciate the passion and commitment of Americans and citizens around the world to help the communities terrorized by the LRA,’ neither would comment on Pelton's effort. Pelton, the author of ‘The World's Most Dangerous Places,’ says he has done work for U.S. military commanders in Afghanistan, and that he excels at finding people who don't want to be found. If his plan is funded, he would start looking for Kony, who is likely in the Central African Republic, early next year, he said. ‘I am actually walking through the jungle myself with a stalwart band of like-minded people with all the right skills,’ Pelton said by telephone, adding that his group won't be looking to kill anyone and intends to comply with local laws. U.S. Army special forces Master Sergeant Eric, center, who would only give his first name in accordance with special forces security guidelines, speaks with troops from the Central African Republic and Uganda, in Obo, Central African Republic, where U.S. special forces have paired up with local troops and Ugandan soldiers to seek out Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) ‘I'm not Wyatt Earp,’ he insisted. ‘I'm not gathering a posse to chase down Kony for the money. I'm trying to see if I can create a system that works.’ By ‘works’ Pelton means a system that can finally get Kony, who was indicted by the International Criminal Court in 2005 on crimes against humanity charges including sexual slavery, rape and murder. J. Peter Pham, director of the Africa Center at the Atlantic Council, a think tank in Washington, said: ‘One really does not know whether this scheme merits ridicule or reproach. 'The notion of asking the public to contribute to sending a self-promoting adventurer and two filmmakers off to find an elusive warlord whom the militaries of several African countries assisted by U.S. Special Operations Forces have not managed to catch is risible, to say the least.’ Pelton's $500,000 crowd-funding bid via indiegogo - a platform like Kickstarter - has raised only about $7,500 in two weeks. The Ugandan military spokesman, Lt. Col. Paddy Ankunda, said he had not heard of Pelton's mission, though he sounded incredulous when it was described to him. 'We wish him good luck. That's all I can say,' Ankunda said. Pelton's $500,000 crowd-funding bid via indiegogo has raised only about $7,500 in two weeks . Pelton isn't alone in trying to bring Kony to justice, other efforts include: . The U.S. Africa Command says the LRA has 'murdered, raped and kidnapped tens of thousands of innocent men, women and children' and that more than 380,000 people across three African countries have been displaced while fleeing the violence. The U.S. State Department is offering a $5 million reward - up to $15 million total - for help in the arrest of Kony and two of his lieutenants. Ugandan Brig. Sam Kavuma, who took over earlier this year as the top commander of African Union troops searching for Kony in a wild, sparely inhabited region of dense jungle covering Congo, South Sudan and Central African Republic, spoke well of Bridgeway's contribution, saying it made the mission more agile. Others though, including those who are generally pleased with the group's role, say that disputes arise between U.S. troops, the Ugandan military and Bridgeway's private contractors. Simon Mulongo, a lawmaker who sits on the defense and internal affairs committee of Uganda's parliament, said Bridgeway's private contractors are essentially 'a mercenary force, and mercenaries have limitations.' He said there were concerns about the chain of command and possible infighting. The contractors carry light weapons and tracking devices, Mulongo said. Kavuma disputed this account, saying the contractors are not armed and that only one of them is still active on the ground in central Africa. Besides its other assistance, Bridgeway is also financing a canine unit to find children abducted by Kony's army. 'What was happening was you just could never find the children in that vast of a jungle, in that thick of a jungle, and so these sniffer dogs would come in and they could smell where the children had bed down and help find them,' said Shannon Sedgwick Davis, Bridgeway's chief executive. Robert Young Pelton, pictured in 2003, whose crowd-funding scheme has already drawn criticism from a pair of Africa experts, is the latest to join a line of private individuals and aid groups who are trying to corner Joseph Kony and the members of his Lord's Resistance Army . Davis said she discussed Bridgeway's involvement with the U.S. government and United Nations officials and focused on filling gaps in the official anti-Kony mission. The U.S. State Department said it has no objections to Bridgeway's escalated role and that it seeks to coordinate with all such groups where possible. Maj. Fred Harrel, a spokesman for the U.S. military's Africa Command, said the African-led, U.S.-supported mission has reduced Kony's operating space and influence. 'There has been an overall reduction in attacks, abductions, and civilians killed, along with increased defections from the LRA,' he said. But despite all the efforts, Kony remains on the loose.

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . Four men accused of punching and kicking a motorist who accidentally struck a 10-year-old Detroit boy were ordered Monday to stand trial on attempted murder charges, after a judge reviewed their statements to police and witnesses testified about the chaotic mob attack. As Steve Utash continued to recover in a hospital bed, Judge Thomas Jackson found probable cause to move the case to trial in Wayne County Circuit Court. Prosecutor Lisa Lindsey introduced statements to police from Latrez Cummings, 19, James Davis, 24, and Wonzey Saffold, 30, all acknowledging a role in the April 2 attack. They were ordered to trial, along with Bruce Wimbush Jr., 17, who waived the hearing. Defendants: Wonzey Saffold (left) James Davis (center) and Latrez Cummings go before Judge Thomas Jackson, retired at Frank Murphy Hall of Justice, Monday, April 21, 2014, in Detroit . Teen defendant: Defense attorney Randall Upshaw addresses the court during the preliminary examination of his client Bruce Wimbush Jr., 17, in the beating of motorist Steve Utash after he accidentally struck and injured a child with his truck in Detroit . Attacked: Family members said Steve Utash, pictured with wife Starr, is now off the ventilator and is able to breathe on his own following his vicious April 2 beating . 'I pray for the man every day. I hope him and the boy are going to be OK,' Cummings told police, according to Lindsey. Witnesses to the attack described a chaotic scene. 'They were hollerin' and screamin', ""Oh, my God, get him, get him,""' witness Deborah Hughes testified. Hughes, a nurse, is credited with rushing to the boy's side and also intervening to save Utash from further injuries. She said Cummings likely kicked the victim at least 10 times. Another witness, Ashley Daniels, said Utash was attacked after he got out of his pickup to check on the boy. She said he was stumbling and his hat was knocked off after some early blows. Daniels said Utash was dared to pick up his hat before he was hit again. 'He fell. He got up again,' she said. 'It was like he was almost accepting it.' Wayne County Assistant Prosecuting Attorney Lisa Lindsey speaks before Judge Thomas Jackson at Frank Murphy Hall of Justice . The Detroit Free Press reports that one witness, Anton Sykes, 30, denied a statement prosecutors say he previously gave to police. District Court Judge Thomas Jackson, frustrated with Sykes, said the man was 'defiant' and likely to disappear if he was released from the courtroom. Jackson ordered Sykes jailed on $500,000 bond for trying to avoid testifying. Statements to police indicate that three of four men recognized the boy and had revenge on their mind. 'I saw the little boy on the ground ... and I lost it,' Saffold told investigators. Utash suffered severe . head injuries, while David . Harris, the boy he ran into, was treated for a leg and other injuries. Police quickly ruled that it had been an accident. 'It was determined that the driver of the vehicle wouldn't have had any . chance of stopping,' a Detroit police spokesman told Mail Online. Distraught: Stephen Utash's family members in the courtroom during the preliminary examination of four co-defendants being charged with severely beating Utash after he stopped to check on a child he accidentally struck and injured with his truck in Detroit . Going to trial: Defendants (left to right) Wonzey Saffold, James Davis, center, and Latrez Cummings were ordered to stand trial by Judge Thomas Jackson . Utash, 54, of Macomb County's Clinton Township, is a tree trimmer who was familiar with the east side Detroit neighborhood where a boy darted out in front of his pickup. He spent days in a coma after the beating. Utash's family sat in the front row of the courtroom, while relatives of the accused men sat directly behind them in three rows. There were deep sighs, sobbing and muffled utterances of 'liar' during the testimony. Some spectators were ejected by sheriff's deputies. Jackson noted that the legal threshold to keep the case moving at this stage is low. Defense attorneys said Utash's injuries were awful but an attempted murder charge was too severe. 'One or two may not be enough to kill anyone,' the judge said of punches and kicks, 'but a combination may be enough to cause one's death.' Separately, a 16-year-old boy is charged in Juvenile Court with assault and ethnic intimidation in the case. He and the other defendants are black; Utash is white. 'In the case of the 16-year-old charged . as a juvenile we can prove beyond a reasonable doubt the crimes of . assault with intent to do great bodily harm and ethnic intimidation,' Kym Worthy, Wayne County's prosecutor, said. 'In the case of the four . adult defendants that have been charged, the facts and the evidence does . not support a charge of ethnic intimidation.' Hero: Deborah Hughes helped save Steve Utash's life when she stepped between him and his attackers . Family members announced yesterday that Utash finally came out of an induced coma. His daughter Mandi Emerick, who started a GoFundMe page to cover her dad's medical bills, said Utash is now off the ventilator, but experiences horrible flashbacks. 'Sometimes he can look at me and remember who I am and other times he can't. Today when I asked him how old he is he said ""I'm two years old"" but he did know his name,' she wrote. 'He does keep saying ""I don't want to die I'm sorry"" and ""please don't let me forget you"". He also keeps flashing back to the assault screaming for ""HELP"" and ""PLEASE GET THEM OFF ME"". He didn't seem to know what happened to him or why he was in the hospital.' More than 100 people, including hero Deborah Hughes, gathered at a prayer service for Utash at Historic Little Rock Baptist Church in Detroit on Thursday night. 'No matter how long I'm here I will not have a more special day than the day I go with you and your family to talk with your father, Mayor Mike Duggan said, according to MLive. Healing vigil: Deborah Hughes (center) sat with Utash's family members at a prayer service, attended by hundreds of people, at Historic Little Rock Baptist Church in Detroit for Stephen Utash . Arrests: From left, Wonzey Saffold, James Davis, and Bruce Wimbush Jr face assault with intent to murder charges . In hospital: Steve Utash's family say he is now breathing on his own, can remember some people's names and flashes back to the vicious assault . Loving father: Steve Utash pictured with daughter Mandi Marie. He was brutally beaten by a gang . A Go Fund Me page set up for Utash, who has no health insurance, has already raised more than $181,000. His family, who are keeping a bedside vigil, said on the site: . 'Everyone has been asking us for an update on our dad's condition. We are . very grateful to all who have been  sending cards with kind notes and . prayers for him and our family. I have been putting off posting an . update hoping that after the 'next visit' I would have some better news. But days are going by and  I don't have better news to share. He is . still unable to distinguish reality from his delusions... ' State representative Brian . Banks said Utash did not deserve to be attacked. 'Mr . Utash did the right thing by stopping to help a child in need and, . appallingly, was punished for doing so,' he said. 'People should not be punished for doing the right thing.' Outside court, Utash's brother-in-law Max . Mohr said Utash is struggling and disoriented in the hospital. He said . Utash tried to walk with the help of nurses but lasted only a few steps. 'He's not the Steve I know - not even close,' Mohr said.

On March 15, this year, she took him to Laurels Veterinary Surgery in Hereford, where she claimed he was a stray.

'Joe Rosenthal only saw the second flag go up out of the corner of his eye and took the shot. He didn't known what he had got at the time. 'He got a large group of marines to then pose for the camera around the flag. 'He took his camera down the mountain, got a plane to Guam and had the film developed on the same day and the rest is history.

Navy landing craft disgorge tons of supplies onto the shores of Iwo Jima a few hours after U.S. Marines established a beach-head in March 1945 . The tiny Pacific island of Iwo Jima was seen as key to the United States because it had three airfields that could be used to launch raids on Tokyo and Japan's main islands. Virtually all of the 22,000 Japanese soldiers tasked with defending the rugged, volcanic crag were killed in the battle. The site became a symbol and rallying point for the United States in the Pacific war after the country's flag was raised on its highest ground, Mount Suribachi. The battle claimed 6,821 out of the 30,000 American troops and 21,570 Japanese lives. Dozens of remains are recovered every year, but about 12,000 Japanese are still classified as missing in action and presumed killed on the island, along with 218 Americans. Fighting began on February 19, 1945, but Iwo Jima was not declared secured until March 26. Japan surrendered in August of that year, after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 'Iwo Jima is a unique place in the history of the United States,' said Marine Corps commandant Gen. James Conway, speaking in 2010. 'It was not the bloodiest fight in the Pacific campaign, it was not the most operationally sound, not the longest and arguably not the most important. 'But Iwo is burned into our national psyche in a way that no other battle in U.S. is.'","US troops defeated Japanese on Pacific island in 1945 .

"By . Deborah Dooley . Soap bad boy: Actor Jeff Hordley has played Cain Dingle in Emmerdale since 2000. He realised his lifestyle had to change after he was hospitalised due to Crohn's disease . When actor Jeff Hordley first developed stomach cramps and intermittent diarrhoea his GP blamed Irritable Bowel Syndrome and prescribed drugs to tackle the painful gut spasms. For five years Jeff, best known as bad boy Cain Dingle in Emmerdale, dutifully took the drugs, although they didn’t seem to have much effect. Then Jeff moved from his home in Oldham to Manchester and his symptoms worsened abruptly. He started also suffering from episodes of vomiting - within just a couple of months, he lost over three stone, plummeting to under nine stone, terribly thin for his 6ft frame. ‘I was weak and I looked terrible,’ recalls Jeff, ‘I remember looking in the mirror and thinking grimly that even if I survived, this was not a good look for someone trying to carve out an acting career.’ His new GP referred him for tests at Manchester Royal Infirmary – there a consultant broke the news that Jeff had Crohn’s disease, an auto-immune condition which causes the gastrointestinal tract to become inflamed, triggering symptoms including stomach pain, diarrhoea, vomiting, abcesses and even arthritis. It was a shocking diagnosis – not least because when he was nine, Jeff’s mother had died following a long battle with the very same disease. ‘I was absolutely terrified, ‘ admits Jeff. ‘I was very close to my mum, and her death left a big gap in my life. Now all I could think of was that I was going to die too.’ An estimated 120,000 Britons suffer from Crohn’s. It’s thought to occur when the immune system mistakes bacteria normally found in healthy intestines for invading substances. It sends white cells to attack the ‘rogue’ bacteria – these white cells also cause inflammation which damages the surrounding tissue. Although Crohn’s can involve any area of the digestive tract from the mouth to the anus, it most commonly affects the small intestine and/or colon. Unfortunately it’s not unusual for Crohn’s disease to go undiagnosed for some time, explains Helen Terry, director of information and support at the charity Crohn’s and Colitis UK. ‘Crohn’s disease and Ulcerative Colitis, which both come under the umbrella term of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD,) share a few characteristics with the much more common Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) such as diarrhoea,' she said. ‘However, anyone whose bowel symptoms are accompanied by unexplained weight loss, or who is experiencing rectal bleeding should be referred to a hospital for further investigation. A simple blood test can flag up indicators of Crohn’ s such as anaemia, or inflammatory markers. A family history of irritable bowel disease is also significant, as there is a known hereditary element.’ As soon as Jeff was diagnosed, his father - also called Jeff - made a point of explaining that his mother’s death was actually caused by complications following an operation for her Crohn’s rather than the disease itself. Jeff Hordley is a heated scene from Emmerdale: He goes running three times a week and eats healthily to manage his relapsing and remitting condition . Indeed Jeff’s consultant reassured him that his condition was treatable – in many cases, patients manage with steroids, which prevent the destructive inflammation. However Jeff needed surgery immediately to remove the diseased part of his bowel. The bowel is 6m long, and so can still function normally with a small section removed however Jeff was warned that depending on what surgeons found and how much of the tract was affected, he might need a colostomy bag, perhaps permanently.Jeff, then 25, was stunned. ‘Having a colostomy bag at any age is a big deal, but at that age, it’s almost impossible to contemplate,’ he says. He also felt nervous about telling his partner Zoe Henry, who also now stars in Emmerdale as Rhona Goskirk. ‘We’d met two years previously, at drama college. I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her. But naturally, I was scared that the idea of a colostomy would put her off.’ However, Zoe, who’d previously worked as a nurse, was unfazed. ‘She was brilliant,’ remembers Jeff. ‘She just hugged me and said whatever happened, we’d cope with it, together.’ After surgery lasting several hours, Jeff came round to discover that surgeons had successfully removed the scarred part of his bowel - and there was no colostomy bag. ‘I was so relieved I could have cried,’ he says. Jeff was in hospital for 12 days, and given steroids and an anti inflammatory drug. He spent the next few months regaining his strength, and for the next few years, lived a normal life, with only very mild stomach cramping and occasional brief bouts of diarrhoea - going back to the hospital for regular checkups. Jeff felt so well that he allowed himself to think that his condition had somehow disappeared. However, Crohn’s is what’s known as a ‘relapsing and remitting’ disease, meaning that symptoms can die down for long periods of time and then flare up again. And in 2002, six years after Jeff’s operation, things took a sudden and dramatic turn for the worse.‘Zoe was appearing in a play at The West Yorkshire Playhouse, and I’d taken my dad and step mum to see it. I’d been feeling off colour for a couple of days, and during the interval, as I went to get some drinks, I suddenly felt dizzy and collapsed.’ Jeff was rushed to hospital with severe haemorrhaging from his back passage. The bleeding stemmed from the original operation site in his bowel, although doctors couldn’t say why it had happened. After more treatment with steroids, he again recovered well - but Jeff describes that episode as something of an epiphany. ‘I realised that Crohn’s would always be with me. And that I owed it to myself, as well as to Zoe and everyone who loved me, to start really taking care of myself. I knew that smoking and drinking alcohol – both of which I’d been doing - are both inflammatory, and can exacerbate the symptoms of Crohns.’ Jeff with his wife, actress Zoe Henry, who he says has been a huge support . With Zoe’s support, Jeff stopped smoking, cut right down on his alcohol intake and tried to eat as healthily as possible, completely avoiding convenience and processed foods. But despite this, he was hospitalised again, a few months later, with a blocked bowel. A five day stay in hospital and some . medication sorted this out; then doctors suggested putting Jeff on a . drug called Azathioprine, which helps keep symptoms at bay by . suppressing the immune system. But he and Zoe were concerned by the . possible side effects which range from a cough and fatigue to shortness . of breath and muscle pain. They were also starting to think about having . a family, and worried that the drug might impact on Jeff’s fertility - . although there’s currently no evidence that this is the case. ‘We decided to look into other ways of managing my Crohn’s,’ says Jeff. With . the help of a nutritionist, Jeff discovered that going on a wheat, . dairy sugar and alcohol free diet for short periods at a time helps his . symptoms and energy levels - he avoids coffee and monosodium glutamate, . which he says aggravate his condition. He . is no longer on any medication but takes aloe vera juice (said to ease . digestion), pro-biotics (to restore the good bacteria in the gut) and a . herbal supplement called Simba, derived from the African potato plant . (said to support the immune system). Jeff, . who has been working on Emmerdale since 2000, doesn’t have much free . time, but makes sure he goes running three times a week. ‘It’s a great stress reliever,’ he says. ‘Which is great, because stress is known to make Crohn’s symptoms worse.’ In August 2003, Jeff and Zoe married, and are now the proud parents of Violet, five, and Stan, three. The family live in Leeds. ‘I know Crohn’s has a hereditary link, and of course I’ve thought about the possibility of my children having it’, says Jeff. ‘But I prefer not to dwell on it, and rather think positive.’ ‘It took me a while to accept that I had a lifelong condition, and the same illness my mum had,’ says Jeff. ‘But I know that Mum wouldn’t have wanted me to dwell on it, rather to be strong and get on with my life. Now I feel that I manage it well. ‘I’d say to anyone newly diagnosed with Crohn’s: educate yourself about the condition, and understand that although it’s not curable, it is treatable. And then find what works for you.’ Crohn’s and Colitis UK nacc.org.uk, telephone 0845 1303344 .

Fans reported getting to the middle of Bridget Jones: Mad About The Boy only to find their narrator replaced with Del Boy. Fans of Bridget Jones got more than expected today when parts of Sir David Jason's autobiography appeared halfway through Helen Fielding's latest novel .

Dubbed 'Super Thursday', dozens of new titles hit the shelves in preparation for the Christmas market. Not that Fielding’s novel needed any extra publicity, but the publishing blunder only served to get readers talking even more. Fans already knew about the main plot twist after extracts were published in the Sunday Times Magazine. Fans were shocked and upset to learn that hero Mark Darcy is dead and Bridget has become a widow. The 55-year-old mother of two was seen decked out in gym gear as she headed for a workout near her north London home. She . teamed her leggings and sweater with slightly less practical biker . boots – but would no doubt have kicked them off when she arrived at her . Pilates class.

"By . Tom Goodenough . The man's time in the limelight was short-lived, however, as he was bundled away by officers . A man has been arrested after disrupting the Olympic torch relay by running naked past spectators. The streaker had 'Free Tibet' written on his back and managed only a short distance before being tackled by police in Henley-on-Thames. He was covered in a blanket by officers and led away. A Thames Valley Police spokeswoman confirmed that a 27-year-old man from Henley has been arrested on suspicion of outraging public decency. Hundreds of onlookers watched the man disrupt proceedings in the Oxfordshire town as the torch made its way through on the 53rd day of the relay. A Henley resident who was lining the procession route said the streaker came out of the crowd. Andrew Tinsley, and environmental scientist, said: 'The guy came out of nowhere. He definitely picked his moment to shine. 'The streaker completely out-footed the policeman on the other side of the bus. 'The juxtaposition of the bus relay logo of a running man and the streaker was immensely funny.' As well as emblazoning his back with the message, the streaker also carried a fake Olympic torch as he ran past spectators. On a notable day on the Olympic Torch . relay, the Queen welcomed torchbearers to Windsor Castle. Local residents ran through the grounds of the royal residence with the flaming symbol of the London Games as excitement over the global event mounted. In 17 days the Queen will declare the Games open during a spectacular ceremony at the Olympic Park in Stratford, east London. In the run-up to the sporting spectacular the Olympic flame has been travelling around the UK and has been greeted by cheering crowds for much of its journey. In the castle's quadrangle the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh watched as torchbearer Gina Macgregor, 74, ran into the open space after earlier receiving the flame from Renate Beynon, 66. Its journey began today in Oxford where athletics legend Sir Roger Bannister started the flame on its way at the site of his greatest sporting achievement, the Iffley Road track where he broke the magical four-minute mile barrier on a balmy evening on May 6, 1954. The man ran past crowds naked carrying a fake Olympic torch in upmarket Henley-on-Thames . As well as carrying the fake torch, the 27-year-old streaker also had 'Free Tibet' written on his back . The torch arrives through the Henry 8th Gate at Windsor Castle during a downpour this afternoon. It was then carried through the castle grounds to be met by the Queen . The sun rears its head as the Queen and Prince Philip watch torchbearer Gina Macgregor (right) pass the Olympic Flame Phillip Wells outside Windsor Castle . When the flame is exchanged between runners they touch their torches together, known as a 'kiss moment'. But in a bid to allow the royals to . watch a handball demonstration from schoolchildren the symbol of the . Games was put into a lantern. Minutes before the flame arrived grey . skies which had been threatening rain let go a torrential downpour . which forced guests under the shelter of the castle's Sovereign's . Entrance. Mrs Macgregor, from Taplow near . Slough, arrived soaking wet and met the Queen who was wearing a rain . cape and wielding an umbrella with Philip by her side. Laughing, Mrs Macgregor told the royal couple 'I looked fine this morning', and they both began chuckling. Earlier in the day, Sir Roger Bannister was joined by London 2012 chairman Lord Coe at the Iffley Road track in Oxford. Sir Roger said: 'It's an honour to be . included in a list of torch carriers which has included injured . soldiers back from Afghanistan and other places, and I'm glad that it's . taking place on this track in Oxford where I ran the four-minute mile in . 1954.

Today it looks like it might rain and that day the weather . was so bad that I nearly decided not to attempt it. 'In retrospect, I'm glad because if I hadn't attempted it that day I might not have had another chance. 'In . a way I'm back in the sport that I belong to. I spent 10 years training . before I broke the four-minute mile. I send my best wishes to all those . who are training now and are competing in the Olympics in London.' Lord Coe said: 'It's very special. Roger has done so much inside British sport. 'Breaking the four-minute mile as a mark . of athletic achievement sits central in the history of our sport. He . paved the way for what we did in the late 70s and early 80s.' Hundreds of people watched as . 83-year-old Sir Roger carried the flame along the athletics track before . handing the torch to 25-year-old student Nicola Byrom. Rowing legend Sir Steve Redgrave also carried the flame in a boat along the River Thames through Henley-on-Thames.

The former Olympian was able to keep up a sedate pace that allowed the thousands of spectators lining the route to cheer him on. In the background was the River and . Rowing Museum where the boat Sir Steve used to win his fifth gold medal . at the 2000 Sydney Olympics is on permanent display. He . exchanged the Olympic flame with the previous torchbearer as he sat in . the slimline vessel and then, with seven other rowers and a cox, set off . on a circuit of the riverbank. Once he had his feet on dry land, Sir Steve set off on a brief run to hand the flame on to the next torchbearer. He said: 'To have my hands on the torch is pretty special. It’s surreal - when I retired in 2000 I was asked to come on to the bid team. 'What we were working towards were the Games in 2012 and now it’s just 18 days away.' Celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal carries the Olympic Flame on the Torch Relay leg today in Slough . Sir Steve Redgrave, who won an unprecedented five gold medals in his illustrious career said it was 'pretty special' to be asked to carry the torch . Celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal also took part in the torch relay as it passed through Slough. The . Michelin-starred celebrity chef, renowned for his snail porridge and . sardine ice cream dishes, said he was close to tears as thousands of . people lined the streets to watch the flame pass. He said: 'I had no idea there were going to be this many people here. I've got a proper lump in my throat. 'The turnout is incredible. The energy - this is what the Olympics is all about.' The torch will travel a total of 87 miles today, and be transported by 111 torch bearers on the 53rd day of the relay.","Naked man carries fake torch through Henley as stunned crowd look on .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Bad news for parents - toddlers are better at choosing their own bedtimes than adults, according to a new study. U.S. scientists have found the main reason that toddlers are unable to sleep is because they often go to bed too early before their body clock is ready. While an early bedtime might mean a break for parents, children lie awake for hours and end up associating bedtime with ‘arousal’ rather than sleep, the researchers warned. Many children put to bed too early lie awake for hours and end up associating bedtime with 'arousal' rather than sleep, researchers have warned . An early bedtime might make toddlers . resist bedtime, throw tantrums and resort to what the study calls . 'curtain calls' - constantly getting up out of bed and coming downstairs . or into their parents' bedroom, the University of Colorado, Boulder . scientists said. The study, published in journal Mind, Brain and Education said a good night’s sleep depends on when toddlers experience a rise in the body's levels of the hormone melatonin, which increases during the evening to govern the internal body clock. Factors like the amount of light as well as the child's own physical make up could determine when melatonin is at the right level but it varies from child to child. The scientists said that choosing a bedtime that is out of sync with the child's body clock is what causes sleepless nights - for both the child and parents. They also warned that sleepless nights . for toddlers could lead to them growing up with emotional and . behavioural problems in later life. An early bedtime might make toddlers resist bedtime, throw tantrums and resort to what the study calls 'curtain calls' - constantly getting up out of bed and coming downstairs . The researchers studied 14 toddlers aged between 30 and 36 months, over six consecutive nights and measured melatonin levels at various intervals around bedtime, timed how long they took to sleep as well as their behaviour. On average, the study found that melatonin levels rose at around 7.40pm in the evening and if parents then waited half an hour to put their children to bed, the child was typically asleep within 30 minutes. But if children with later melatonin rise times were put to bed at that time, they took longer to go to sleep and were more likely to get up again or behave badly. Associate professor and physiologist, Monique LeBourgeois, who led the study, said: ‘Sleeping at the wrong “biological clock” time leads to sleep difficulties, like insomnia, in adults. ‘While adults get to choose their own bedtime, toddlers rarely have this option. A good night's sleep for toddlers depends on when they experience a rise in the body's levels of the hormone melatonin, which increases during the evening to govern the internal body clock . ‘A poor fit between bedtimes selected by . parents of toddlers and a rise in evening melatonin production increases . the likelihood of night-time settling difficulties.’ The report said: ‘Toddlers with longer intervals between the onset of nightly melatonin release and their subsequent bedtimes were shown to fall asleep more quickly and had decreased bedtime resistance as reported by their parents.’ In other words, the more tired they are when they go to bed, the more likely they are to sleep. Professor LeBourgeois added: ‘If your child is resisting bedtime or having problems falling asleep, it is likely he or she is not physiologically ready for sleep at that time. ‘For these toddlers, lying in bed awake for such a long time can lead to the association of bed with arousal, not sleep. ‘This type of response may increase children's lifelong risk for insomnia over time.’","Choosing a bedtime that is out of .

"By . Janet Street Porter for the Daily Mail . Janet Street Porter wears a purple patterned dress, £55, from Long Tall Sally. She said: 'Fitted perfectly. Bit too sensible for me, but many women will love this frock' There are endless advantages to being tall. It doesn't matter where I sit in the cinema or theatre, I can always see (I don’t worry about the poor souls who have to sit behind me!). And all my vital statistics are spaced a bit further apart, so I can easily pass for a dress size smaller than my usual size 14 (or 16 if I’ve been eating a lot of carbs and loafing about). However, there are downsides. Finding clothes that fit is really difficult, especially if you're out of your 20s. The young and super-slender can get away with really short clothes from regular ranges on the High Street, (relying on opaque tights to save their modesty). But once you get older and want stuff that's fashionable and not mumsy, the problems begin. And don't even get me started on finding decent shoes - women who are 6ft tall like me generally have size 8 feet, and most shops just go up to size 7. Once, only models were tall, but now it's the norm. My generation got free school milk and turned out to be giants, and in the subsequent decades girls have just got taller. But clothing manufacturers seem reluctant to cater for this growing market. One Mail reader, Rachel Smith, emailed me to protest about this. 'I don't understand why tall clothing is being taken out of High Street stores like New Look, Dorothy Perkins and Next. All the places that tall women relied on to dress them for work, for parties or just casualwear. 'These stores think it's ok to stock the odd ""long"" pair of trousers, most of which are so awful they've been left on the rail for a month. And yet, the ""petite"" range is still going strong in most stores, fully stocked with the latest trends.' Rachel makes the point that many tall ranges are now available solely online, and that when you buy on the internet, you can't try things on, you have to pay a delivery charge, and finding tall ranges online can be confusing. She asks: 'Would stores get rid of disabled access because it wasn't being used enough? Of course not. So why treat tall women as if they don't matter?' My sentiments entirely. Why are tall women treated like fashion pariahs? Why should we have to spend twice as long as everyone else shopping for clothes? Even if we are prepared to spend a lot of money on designer clothes, it's difficult to get something which fits. I've noticed that coats have become shorter than ever. On me they now just about cover my backside, and are basically long jackets. Tall women can never buy any clothing with a waist - even if they are lucky enough to have a waist - because it will be situated just under their bust in normal clothing ranges. Slim pickings: Janet says there aren't enough High Street stores stocking clothes for tall women . All fitted clothing in standard ranges is cut to suit regular proportions, but tall girls need more length in the body. As a stock size 14, tops are not really a problem - as long as I don't want sleeves that actually reach my wrist. Shirts are impossible. Jackets fit, but if they are waisted, it will be about three inches too far north. Sleeves that are supposed to end just below the elbow - three-quarter length - look horrific, bunching up around the fattest bit of our arms. Sweaters are about the only thing a tall girl can buy easily. Dresses, even by top designers, either just cover the knee, which is ok, because that will still be a decent length - or are cut so short that they look like tunics. When you buy clothes online, they rarely . provide the length of the skirt or dress, so you can never be sure if . they'll be decent enough . Of course, we can go to specialist shops like Long Tall Sally, but why should our choice be so pitifully small? Designers routinely showcase their collections on super-tall catwalk models, but then manufacture them for very short people. The reason is probably to keep costs down, because fabric costs money and skirts the length of a pelmet are cheaper to manufacture than something more practical for women over 5ft 4in. I used to regularly shop for trousers at Topshop and Dorothy Perkins, but their ranges have definitely got smaller. Upmarket brands like Cos really score well - they cut dresses so cleverly a size large fits me perfectly and is sufficiently long. I can't recommend them enough - but if you don't live in London, you can only shop online, with less choice. Some of the Edition ranges at Debenhams are great, too. But when you buy clothes online, they rarely provide the length of the skirt or dress, so you can never be sure if they'll be decent enough for travel on public transport, and you have to pay delivery charges. I'm lucky enough to have a stylist who scours the High Street to find me clothes to wear on ITV's Loose Women (and posts the details on its website). But most tall women rightly feel very fed up. Why do retailers hate us so much when we look so good in clothes? You'd think they’d be fighting to dress us. Sadly, the reverse is true.

COS: This Spray pattern dress, £89, hangsbeautifully - and, best of all, the length is perfect fortaller women . TOPSHOP: Tall range jeans, £36 to £42. I have bought them and while they aren't great quality, they are cheap and always come in the latest colours . M&S: These £35 treggings in long fitted well, better than wider trousers which tend to make tall girls look like traffic wardens if not tailored properly to flatter our backsides .","Many ranges for tall women are now only available online .

"By . Mailonline Reporter . A rookie police officer is dead and another eight cops injured after an NYPD van crashed early Sunday in the Bronx. The one-car crash happened about 5am as the van carrying the nine cops crashed underneath the Bruckner Expressway, at Bruckner Boulevard near Bryant Avenue, in the Hunts Point neighborhood, CBS New York reported. Officer Michael Williams, 25 — who had jointed the force in January — was ejected through the back of the van during the crash, the New York Daily News reported. He was transported to Lincoln Medical Center but died of his injuries. 'That’s all he ever wanted to do was become a police officer,' said Philip Banks III, NYPD's chief of department, according to the Daily News. 'It was a dream come true that he was able to serve in the Police Department,' he added of Williams, whose dad was a longtime officer in Carmel, upstate New York. 'We are going to miss Michael.' Williams' casket was draped in an American flag and loaded into an NYPD vehicle about noon — as more than 75 officers saluted silently, according to the Daily News. One NYPD officer died and another eight cops were taken to local hospitals after this police van crashed early Sunday underneath the Bruckner Expressway, in the Bronx . The cause of the crash remains under investigation. The eight injured officers are expected to survive . 'Thank you for showing respect for a fallen comrade,' one inspector told the cops, the Daily News reported. The . other eight injured officers were taken to several hospitals in the . Bronx and were expected to survive, the station reported. One had cuts to his head and injured his right shoulder, according to CBS New York. 'We are hoping and expecting a full recovery,' Banks said, according to the station. The nine . officers were riding from the 47th Precinct in the Bronx to staff the . United Nations and the People's the United Nations Climate March in . Manhattan, according to NBC New York. The cause of the crash remains unclear, but Banks said early-morning showers may have contributed. 'Our . hearts are heavy this morning after a tragic police van accident,' Banks tweeted Sunday morning. 'We pray . for the [officer] we lost, and for a quick recovery of those injured.' Eyewitness William Soto described the scene to CBS New York. 'They put the neck brace on his neck,' Soto told the station. 'They had another officer sitting on the ground and, I guess, for precuation, they put him in the ambulance afterward. 'Then they had another officer standing,' he added. 'I guess, also for precaution, they had him on the board and also took him to the hospital. 'Then a passerby told me: ""Oh, there was another cop laying in the middle of the highway on the Bruckner."" 'He was all mangled up — so he might have been ejected out of the side doors somehow.'

"By . Ashley Collman for MailOnline . Legal battle: Debra Mandelbaum (pictured) is in the midst of a bitter divorce from husband Michael, who says the two were never married to begin with . The multi-milionaire son of a Minnesota Vikings owner is trying to get out of a costly divorce by arguing that he was never married to his wife of 20 years to begin with. Michael and Debra Mandelbaum separated late last year, after he allegedly pushed her down a flight of stairs during a fight at their Warren, New Jersey home. The couple are currently in the middle of a protracted divorce, thanks to a technicality in their 1993 wedding ceremony. The Mandelbaums applied for a marriage license on December 10, 1993, and were married two days later in a Jewish ceremony. But the marriage license wasn't actually issued until December 21. Though they lived together as husband and wife for more than two decades, and share three children, Mr Mandelbaum says he was never legally married and therefore exempt from divorce and the traditional dividing of property. Mr Mandelbaum filed a motion to dismiss the divorce in May. The case has continued after his estranged wife submitted evidence to the court of their relationship. Among the documents are joint tax returns, deeds and anniversary cards where Mr Mandelbaum wrote 'For my wife' and 'after 20 years, I'd marry you all over again'. The couple are due back in court early next month. At stake is the Mandelbaum's estimated $2million six-bedroom home in Warren. 50/50 split? The couple shared this estimated $2million home in Warren, NJ prior to their break-up. Last December, police were called to the house where they found Mrs Mandelbaum half-conscious at the bottom of the stairs . In a strange tie to the current NFL scandal involving Ray Rice, Mr Mandelbaum was accepted into the same pretrial intervention program for hitting his wife last year. Candidates accepted into the program can have the charges dropped if they successfully complete the course. Dad: Michael Mandelbaum is the son of David Mandelbaum (pictured), one of the wealthiest men in America and a minority owner of the Minnesota Vikings . Rice went through the program, which many considered too light a sentence after video was released, showing him punching then-fiancée Janay Palmer. Mandelbaum's wife obtained a temporary restraining order against her husband after he pushed her down a set of stairs at their house last December. Police responding to the scene found Mrs Mandelbaum half-conscious at the bottom of the stairs. Mr Mandelbaum was charged with aggravated assault in the third degree before being accepted into the intervention program. Mr Mandelbaum is the son of David Mandelbaum, one of the wealthiest people in America. According to Forbes, David Mandelbaum and his family made $900million last year. In addition to a minority ownership in the Minnesota Vikings, David Mandelbaum has stakes in Vornado Realty Trust. His son Michael 'handles the legal affairs of the family'.","Michael and Debra Mandelbaum were married in December 1993, but the marriage license wasn't issued until after their ceremony .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans for MailOnline . Texas's top criminal court has thrown out a law banning 'upskirt' pictures - because it restricts photographers' right to freedom of expression. The Court of Criminal Appeal struck down part of the anti-'creepshot' statute, which criminalised the taking of surreptitious images in public for the purposes of sexual gratification. These included revealing photos of women - often called 'upskirting' or 'downblousing' - that were taken without their consent. Rejecting the law on Wednesday, Judge Sharon Keller claimed it was a violation of federal free-speech rights and a 'paternalistic' intrusion of a person's right to be aroused. Rejected: Texas's highest criminal court has thrown out a law banning 'upskirt' pictures - because it restricts photographers' right to free speech and is a 'paternalistic' intrusion of a person's right to be aroused . She said that photos - like paintings, films and books - are 'inherently expressive' and therefore protected by the First Amendment, according to the Houston Chronicle. 'The camera is essentially the photographer's pen and paintbrush,' wrote Judge Keller in her opinion. 'A person's purposeful creation of photographs and visual recordings is entitled to the same First Amendment protection as the photographs and visual recordings themselves.' Under the 8-1 ruling, which supported a previous decision made at the 4th Court of Appeals in San Antonia, Texans could take surreptitious images for arousal or sexual gratification. Peter Linzer, who teaches constitutional and First Amendment law at the University of Houston, told the newspaper: 'It's hard to see how you could make taking a picture a crime.' Case: The Texas Court of Criminal Appeal (pictured) struck down part of the anti-'creepshot' statute, which criminalised the taking of surreptitious images in public for the purposes of sexual gratification . The appeal, which questioned why some free speech can be treated as unlawful behavior while others are not, stemmed from a case involving a man charged with improper photography in 2011. Ronald Thompson, in his early fifties, was charged with 26 counts of improper photography after taking underwater pictures of children, aged 3-11, dressed in swimsuits at a San Antonio water park. Prosecutors claimed that the constitutional right to free speech, including taking public photographs, should not be a cover behind which lawbreakers can hide. But Thompson's attorneys claimed the statute did not distinguish 'upskirt' photography from 'merely photographing a girl in a skirt walking down the street', meaning it could criminalise paparazzi journalists, arts patrons, pep rally attendees and 'even the harmless eccentric'. Surreptitious: Rejecting the statute, Judge Sharon Keller said that photos - like paintings, films and books - are 'inherently experessive' and therefore protected by the First Amendment . Judge Keller appeared to agree, saying: 'Protecting someone who appears in public from being the object of sexual thoughts seems to be the sort of ""paternalistic interest in regulating the defendant's mind"" that the First Amendment was designed to guard against.' But she added: 'We also keep in mind the Supreme Court’s admonition that the forms of speech that are exempt from 1st Amendment protection are limited, and we should not be quick to recognize new categories of unprotected expression.' She also admitted that 'upskirt'-type images are intolerable invasions of a person's privacy. During the past 13 years, at least 151 inappropriate photography cases have been filed in Harris County. One saw a 12-year-old girl sentenced to a year's probation for surreptitiously taking a photograph of a classmate in a school dressing-room, even though the image did not show nudity and was deleted minutes later.","Texas Court of Criminal Appeal struck down part of anti-'creepshot' law .

"By . Darren Boyle for MailOnline . The wife of British hostage Alan Henning has called on 'the people of the Islamic State to see it in their hearts to release my husband', describing him as a 'peaceful, selfless man'. Mr Henning, a former taxi driver from Bolton, was taken hostage last December in Syria by ISIS while he was trying to deliver aid to victims of the country's civil war. The 47-year-old aid worker was shown at the end of a video last week after the beheading of fellow British captive David Haines. Scroll down for video . Alan Henning, right, was kidnapped by ISIS in December while he was delivering humanitarian aid in Syria . ISIS is threatening to murder the 47-year-old former taxi driver from Manchester . Mr Henning's wife Barbara said she has sent messages to ISIS asking them to release her husband but has had no response. In a statement released through the Foreign Office she said: 'Alan is a peaceful, selfless man who left his family and his job as a taxi driver in the UK to drive in a convoy all the way to Syria with his Muslim colleagues and friends to help those most in need. 'When he was taken he was driving an ambulance full of food and water to be handed out to anyone in need. 'His purpose for being there was no more and no less. This was an act of sheer compassion. 'I cannot see how it could assist any State's cause to allow the world to see a man like Alan dying.' She added: 'I pray that the people holding Alan respond to my messages and contact me before it is too late.' It is the first time Mr Henning's family has issued a public statement since he was threatened in the ISIS video earlier this month. The extremist group has previously released footage showing the killing of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff. A separate video released this week showed British photojournalist John Cantlie sitting at a desk reading from a prepared script and explaining that he would speak about IS in future videos. There was no threat to kill Mr Cantlie made on camera. A series of pleas for the release of Mr Henning have been made by high-profile Muslim leaders in recent days, warning IS that the killings and threats are against Sharia law. Renowned Jihadi ideologue Muhammed al-Maqdisi and the family of jailed Pakistani scientist Dr Aafia Siddiqui, nicknamed 'Lady al Qaida', whose release has been demanded by ISIS extremists, have also called for Mr Henning to be released. Mr Henning had just arrived in Syria in December 2013 when he was kidnapped by ISIS terrorists . 'I am Barbara Henning, the wife of Alan Henning. 'Alan was taken prisoner last December and is being held by the Islamic State. 'Alan is a peaceful, selfless man who left his family and his job as a taxi driver in the UK to drive in a convoy all the way to Syria with his Muslim colleagues and friends to help those most in need. 'When he was taken he was driving an ambulance full of food and water to be handed out to anyone in need. His purpose for being there was no more and no less. This was an act of sheer compassion. 'I cannot see how it could assist any state's cause to allow the world to see a man like Alan dying. 'I have been trying to communicate with the Islamic State and the people holding Alan. I have sent some really important messages but they have not been responded to. 'I pray that the people holding Alan respond to my messages and contact me before it is too late. 'When they hear this message I implore the people of the Islamic State to see it in their hearts to release my husband Alan Henning.' Meanwhile, ISIS has released forty nine hostages who were seized by Islamic militants in Iraq have been freed and safely returned to Turkey, . Turkish prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu said the hostages had been returned to Turkey following intense negotiations. The hostages were seized from the Turkish Consulate in Mosul, Iraq on June 11, when ISIS  overran the city in its surge to seize large swathes of Iraq and Syria. Their release contrasts with the recent beheadings of two US journalists and a British aid worker by the Islamic State group, but it wasn't immediately clear what Turkey had done to secure the safe release of the hostages. Deputy prime minister Bulent Arinc said the hostages are 49 Turkish consulate employees - 46 Turks and three local Iraqis - including consul general Ozturk Yilmaz, other diplomats, children and special forces police. Thirty two Turkish truck drivers who were also seized in Mosul on June 6 were released a month later. Turkey did not provide information surrounding their release.

"By . Lillian Radulova for Daily Mail Australia . Sydneysiders who opted for a late-night stroll by the ocean would have been treated to a romantic sight on Sunday night as the ocean literally glowed blue with each rolling wave. As delighted Manly Beach locals shared snaps of the strange phenomenon across social media, Iain Suthers from the University of New South Wales told Daily Mail Australia that the strange glow is likely to continue over the next few days before dispersing over the weekend. The oceanography expert said the colourful display was nothing to be concerned about, describing it as 'a seasonal event, welcoming the early stages of spring'. A local photographer captured the bright blue glow of the waves on Sydney's Manly beach on Sunday night . 'The glow is caused by Noctiluca scintillans, which is a single celled phytoplankton - the algae of the sea - which blossoms in the spring and the autumn and in 90 per cent of occasions occurs due to natural causes,' Mr Suthers said. 'It has organs inside its cells which allow it to bioluminate. It is really common in the deep ocean and only occurs at night when the animals - like squid or fish, bacteria or single cell pytoplantuum - use it to communicate. 'They might just have bacteria they have on their bodies, or they have their own enzymes to make themselves glow.' Mr Suthers, who researched the environmental spectacle 10 years ago, said that the algae appears due to a certain sequence of events that occur in the ocean, but that the exact environmental recipe for its occurrence is still unknown. The colour came from a group of single-celled phytoplankton at the waters surface, called Noctiluca scintillans . The cells glow when they senses a pressure change, which indicates that a predator is about to eat them . 'They probably started up off the coast of Port Stephens, where the eastern Australian current separates from the coast,' Mr Suthers said of Sunday night's event. The natural oceanographic up-welling of nutrients which occurs in this area, as well as the nutrients from the recent rainfall, followed by the stable calm conditions and plenty of sunlight, are likely to have brought the algae to the surface. Mr Suthers explained that the bizarre carnivorous cell, which preys on another type of algae called diatoms, gives off the luminous glow as a defence mechanism. The natural phenomenon is not dangerous, according to oceanography expert Iain Suthers, and is likely to last for the next few night . 'It eats these diatoms and grows and blooms and divides and it fills the water column and they float to the surface as a whole when the population starts to age,' he said. 'These cells glow at night, at any stage of their life, from when they first start to divide. 'What causes it is a little pressure from the breaking of wave or when you dive in to the water- any sense of pressure change like that, indicates that a predator is about to eat them. 'And so they give off this beautiful bioluminescence signal to warn off any potential predators trying to have a go at them.'","Breaking waves at Manly Beach in Sydney's north were glowing bright blue on Sunday night .

Way to glow: Tourists flock to Tennessee every year to see the incredible light display of the synchronous fireflies . According to the National Park Service, the lightning bugs live for just 21 days as adults and produce bioluminescence to snare prey and lure mates. Each species of firefly has a characteristic flash light pattern that make it recognizable. The males fly and flash, while stationary females respond with a spasm of light. They flash the most within a two-week period in late May to mid-June. 'It’s mind-blowing, like a silent symphony,' North Carolina's Daniel Carlson told New York Times in 2011. 'How? Why? Why here? We have no clue.' Catering for the masses: The Park Service provides a bus  to the annual firefly viewing near the Elkmont Campground in Tennessee .

"By . Sarah Griffiths for MailOnline . A ‘disco squid’ that changes colour and glows in the dark ensures that life below the ocean waves is never dull. The Caribbean reef squid’s incredible technicolour display was caught on camera as it hunted for food at night. The 12-inch (30cm) cephalopod was snapped searching for prey in the shadows, before rapidly swimming away with its catch while flashing different colours. Scroll down for video . The 12-inch (30 cm) Carribean reef squid (pictured) was snapped searching for prey in the shadows, before rapidly swimming away with its catch while flashing different colours . Photographer Masa Ushioda, 43, encountered the rainbow-coloured creature 50ft (15metres) underwater during a dive at the City of Washington Wreck off Florida Keys in the US. Mr Ushioda, who lives in Hawaii, said: ‘I found this squid hunting for prey and it started targeting some zoo plankton off my dive lights. The squid uses chromatophores in its skin to rapidly change colour . ‘When they are hunting, they get excited and display the most brilliant colours using the special chromatophores in their skin. ‘As soon as it had snatched a couple of planktons, it jetted away with excitement.’ Caribbean reef squid are known to communicate by changing their colour, shape and texture. They can do this by the nervous control of chromatophores, which are pigment-containing and light-reflecting organelles in cells found in a wide range of animals. The creatures use their transformative power to stay concealed from predators, become large in the face of danger and flash different colours to find a mate. Incredibly, they can change colour on one side of their body to give another squid a message on their right, while adopting different colours on the rest f their body. Mr Ushioda said: ‘I'm happy with how the squid came out with colours because sometimes it is difficult to capture them. ‘The key is to deliberately underexpose the photo muting the strobe light, and then brighten the picture later to bring out its natural colours.’ ‘Disco clams’ were recently caught on camera 'partying' on the ocean floor while producing their own strobe light effects. And now one scientist, who first came across the entertaining mollusc four years ago, has discovered the secret of how it lights up. Ctenoides ales, dubbed disco clams because of this unique feature, produce the effect using its lips - which is packed with tiny spheres of reflective silica - like a mirror ball. Lindsey Dougherty encountered the two-inch clam in 2010 while diving with her mother and sister in Wakatobi, Indonesia. She saw Ctenoides ales roll the edge of its mantle - a layer of muscle and tissue that acts like a cloak over the mollusc's body - and produce a strobe-light effect using its mirrored lips. She found that the flashing was not a form of bioluminescence, which is a chemical reaction inside animals like plankton that produces light similar to that of a glow stick. Instead, she found, the edge of the clam's mantle lip is highly reflective on one side. When the clam unfurls its lip - typically twice a second - the millimetre-wide mirror is revealed and reflects the ambient light, like a disco ball. The inside of the clam's lip is packed with tiny spheres of silica, only 340 nanometers in diameter, that are ideal reflectors, particularly of the blue light that penetrates deeper into seawater compared to red light. The outside of the lip contains no silica nanospheres, so when the lip is furled, no light is reflected, according to the study, published in the British Journal of the Royal Society Interface. By repeatedly unfurling and furling the lip, the clam produces a continual rippling light show. The non-reflective back of the lip strongly absorbs blue light, so it appears dark and makes the contrast between the sides even more striking. ‘Disco clams’ were caught on camera 'partying' on the ocean floor while producing their own strobe light effects .","Caribbean reef squid flashed different colours after it caught prey .

A 17-year-old student has described his relationship with his 35-year-old English teacher accused of having sex with two teenagers as a 'teacher with benefits'. Brainne Altice, a former teaching assistant at Davis High School in Kaysville, Utah,appeared for a preliminary hearing in Farmington to face allegations from the former students, and is now facing nine felony charges. One of the teenage boys, now 18, offered graphic details during his testimony about how he went from being Altice's student to allegedly having sex with her in his Farmington home. Former: Davis High School English teacher Brianne Altice stands before the judge during her first court hearing in January in Farmington, Utah, accused of having sexual relationships with two of her students . The teen testified that he was 17 years old when a relationship with Altice took place between April and June of last year, according to The Salt Lake Tribune. He says it began with kissing between class periods and eventually led to intercourse. When asked Friday to describe his relationship with Brianne Altice, the teenage boy said she was his 'teacher with benefits.' Altice, who was arrested in October for the alleged incidents involving the first student, now faces nine felony counts in connection with the allegations involving two of her former students. Farmington 2nd District Judge John Morris ordered her on Friday to return to court on Oct. 9 to face three counts of rape and one charge of forcible sodomy. Altice has pleaded not guilty to all counts. Her attorney Ed Brass argued she did not use her position as a teacher to persuade the teen into having a sexual relationship. He says she succumbed to the student's frequent flirting. Under Utah law, a victim cannot consent to sex if the other person is in a position of special trust. Altice, who was arrested in October for the alleged incidents involving the first student, now faces nine felony counts in connection with the allegations involving two of her former students . Altice was fired from Davis High School in February. She remains free on $10,000 bail. On Friday, Brass peppered the teen with questions mostly concerning dates and the timeframe in which the alleged sexual contact occurred. Prosecutors say the teacher acknowledged to investigators that she had engaged in sex with the 16-year-old boy on two occasions. But Brass has asked the judge to not allow those statements at her trial, arguing that she was intimidated by the eight to 10 male officers who came to her home last October to interview her about the allegations. Brass argued that the officers would not let her care for children, call an attorney or use the restroom for nearly four hours as they questioned her. 'Her statements were coerced and involuntary and were taken in violation of her so-called Miranda rights,' Brass wrote in court papers. 'The evidence she provided was the product of that tainted statement.'

Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston will be now suspended for the whole of Saturday's game against Clemson after yelling obscenities about the female anatomy in the center of campus. The 20-year-old, Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback shouted 'f*** her right in the p****' in the middle of the Tallahassee campus on Tueday. Interim President Garnett S. Stokes and athletic director Stan Wilcox announced the decision late Friday night. There had been criticism that the original punishment of half a game for Winston's latest embarrassing off-field incident was too light. Scroll down for video . Suspended: Heisman Trophy-winner Jameis Winston was suspended for half a game for shouting obscenities in the center of FSU campus Tuesday . The statement released by the university Friday read, 'Based upon the results of our continuing investigation of Tuesday's incident involving Jameis Winston, we have decided to not play him for the entire game against Clemson on Saturday night.' The university also had initially announced that Winston would face internal discipline. Officials did not say why Winston was only benched for just a half and they did not provide details of the internal punishment. Winston's alleged crimes run from the absurd, such as shoplifting crab and stealing soda in ketchup cups, to the horrific, as Winston was accused of raping a student in 2012. The phrase he shouted comes from a series of videos staged to look newscasts that went viral earlier in the year. On Wednesday FSU's athletic director Stan Wilcox and interim president Garrett Stokes issued a statement saying Winston 'will be withheld from competition for the first half of the Clemson game.' Winston called his outburst a 'selfish act' in his regularly scheduled press conference after news of the suspension broke. Winston was the target of a rape investigation after a fellow student said he sexually assaulted her while she was intoxicated back in December 2012 as a teammate filmed the act. The New York Times reported in the wake of the alleged sexual assault at Florida State that there was 'virtually no investigation at all.' Heisman: Winston ascended to the national spotlight for his athletic prowess but his off-field behavior has brought the school negative attention and a Title IX investigation . On tape: Winston is recognizable throughout Tallahassee, and just before he is caught on tape leaving a Publix with unpaid food, a bystander is seen gawking at him . Police waited almost a year to interview a witness and gather DNA evidence from the accused, finally declining to prosecute Winston. A Title IX investigation was later launched against FSU. In 2013, cops were called to a Tallahassee Burger King after an assistant manager says she saw Winston stealing soda in ketchup cups. No charges were pressed at the time. The next year, Winston was caught on camera walking out of a Publix supermarket with $32.72 worth of crab legs and crawfish without paying. According to Tomahawk Nation Winston received a citation and his punishment was community service and a temporary suspension from the baseball team, where he plays outfield.","Jameis Winston, 20, won the Heisman Trophy while guiding Florida State's football team to a national championship .

"By . Tom McTague, Deputy Political Editor for MailOnline . Ed Miliband this morning flatly rejected David Cameron’s proposal to block Scottish MPs voting on English laws. The Labour leader said he was open to English-only ‘scrutiny’ of new laws – but insisted he did not want the House of Commons split into different classes of MPs. His position threatens to torpedo the rapid timetable agreed by David Cameron to transfer sweeping new powers to Scotland following last week’s independence referendum. Scroll down for video . Labour leader Ed Miliband said blocking Scottish MPs from voting on English issues would create two classes of MPs . Mr Miliband accused David Cameron of using the Scottish referendum to play politics against the Labour party . Mr Miliband also risks a mutiny among his own MPs, many of whom back ‘English votes for English laws’ over fears the party risks being seen as ‘anti English’. But the Labour leader accused Mr Cameron of using the constitutional crisis sparked by the Scottish referendum to play politics. He said he did not support the idea of an ‘English parliament’ because it meant a ‘new tier of politicians’. He said: ‘I am in favour of one House of Commons with 650 MPs because, goodness, we fought tooth and nail over the last two years to avoid our Parliament being split up and our United Kingdom being split up and I want to make sure that doesn’t happen.’ Mr Miliband added: 'I’m not in favour of a House of Commons that becomes divided. So that somehow the House of Commons chamber is no longer 650 MPs – you’ve got to have one Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.' He insisted he was not against any reform. He said: ‘I’m not against the idea of greater scrutiny of legislation that particularly affects England by English MPs.’ But he said: ‘We can’t do it in a back-of-the-envelope, fag packet way. Let’s have a proper constitutional convention. ‘Let’s not drive our country apart because David Cameron believes it is an opportunity for him to do it. Let’s keep out country together.’ Mr Miliband claimed Mr Cameron was ‘learning the wrong lessons’ from the Scottish referendum. He said: ‘I think constitutional change is important but I think I think there’s a much bigger lesson – it’s the economy stupid. Forty five per cent of people tried to break up our country by voting ‘Yes’. Mr Miliband traveled to the BBC studios at Media City in Salford this morning for the Andrew Marr show . ‘They thought they had nothing to lose, many of them, by saying let’s leave the United Kingdom. Does this country work for an elite few or does it work for most working people?’ He said the vote was a ‘wake-up call’ for the political establishment. The Labour leader said: ‘People right across the United Kingdom will say, David Cameron made a promise – and he’s going to be kept to that. I know David Cameron will want to honour that promise. ‘Trust in politics is sufficiently low that we’ve got to keep our promises.’ He said: ‘We’ve got to look at all the constitutional issues that have been thrown up. There is a big problem, which is power has been devolved in Scotland, power has been devolved in Wales but governments of both parties have failed to devolve power in England. ‘Now the first answer to that question is not to change the nature of the centralised power of Westminster over England, it is to devolve power in England. And that is absolutely crucial.’ He added: ‘There isn’t a simple answer to this question. We’ve been wrestling with this issue for 120 years. Ever since we were talking about Irish Home Rule.’ Mr Cameron has insisted his plan to link further Scottish devolution to the process of making sure only English MPs can vote on English laws is necessary to address a ‘basic unfairness’ in the constitution. He called on Mr Miliband to either work together with him or explain to the people of the UK why he would not tackle the ‘fundamentally unjust’ situation which means Scottish MPs can vote on laws which do not apply to their constituents. The move came after former prime minister Gordon Brown insisted he would make sure Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg stick to the proposed timetable for setting out future powers for Scotland. Mr Cameron's insistence that the new settlement for Holyrood should go hand in hand with efforts to answer the so-called West Lothian question about the rights of Scottish and English MPs at Westminster has been met with wariness from Labour, which has most of Scotland's 59 seats, although Mr Miliband has insisted the party will ensure that the timetable for further devolution will not slip. But Deputy Prime Minister Mr Clegg warned that Mr Cameron's decision to link the issues could see him forced to renege on his promise to the people of Scotland. The cross-party consensus forged between the three leaders has shattered following Mr Cameron's announcement, which came shortly after Scottish voters rejected independence by 55 per cent to 45 per cent. Mr Cameron insisted the timetable setting out the next stages of the devolution process would be met: ‘New powers over tax, spending and welfare are on their way to Scotland. ‘The timetable is brisk, but achievable: a White Paper by November, and draft legislation published by January. It would have to be passed in the next Parliament.’ But writing in the Mail on Sunday he added: ‘This moment must not just be about securing Scotland's future in the UK - and celebrating that fact - but settling other questions whose time has come. ‘The challenge is to make sure our UK works for all nations. ‘Millions of people in the rest of the UK have been listening to these debates, watching this campaign and rightly asking: 'What will change for us? Why can't we have the same powers and the same rights as those in Scotland?' ‘These are questions the Conservative Party itself has been asking for a long time. ‘Why should Scottish MPs be able to vote on what is taught in English schools, to reduce spending on English hospitals, or even vary English or Welsh income taxes, when under the new settlement English or Welsh MPs would have no say in such matters in Scotland? ‘It is fundamentally unjust to have the views of the people of England and Wales overridden in this way.’ David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg made 'a vow' to the Scottish people to transfer new powers to Edinburgh . He added: ‘If the Scottish Parliament will soon have a range of new powers: powers over income tax rates; to change benefits such as housing benefit; to increase spending, including on the NHS – then there is a crying need to reflect that across the UK. But Mr Clegg, writing in The Sunday Times, insisted there could be ‘no ifs, no buts’ about delivering the extra powers promised to Scotland, and the package ‘cannot be made contingent on other constitutional reforms’. He accused the Tories of being more concerned with the threat from Ukip than the vow made to Scotland. He said: ‘The Conservatives, in their rush to protect themselves from an attack from the right, are only concerned about English votes on English matters. ‘Of course we need a solution to this dilemma but, by appearing to link it to the delivery of further devolution to Scotland, they risk reneging on the commitment made to the Scottish people that, in the event of a No vote, new powers would come what may. ‘Worse still, if the Conservatives enter into a Dutch auction with Ukip over ever more extreme solutions to the issue of English votes they could jeopardise the union they purport to defend. ‘Surely we haven't fought to save our union in a vote north of the border, only to see it balkanised in Westminster?’ The Prime Minister has reportedly invited a group of senior Tories to Chequers tomorrow to discuss his plans. Former environment secretary Owen Paterson accused Mr Cameron of ‘panicky and ill-considered bargaining’ over the offer of further powers to Holyrood. He told The Sunday Times it was ‘disgraceful’ that the people of England, Wales and Northern Ireland had not been consulted. Former premier Mr Brown, who has been credited with helping to save the union following his interventions to boost the No campaign, insisted the timetable for setting out the devolution plans would be met.","Labour leader says he's open to English-only 'scrutiny' of law but not vetoes .

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . Up to 25 dogs and puppies have been killed in a huge blaze at a breeder's home in Yorkshire just days after more than 50 were killed in a similar fire in Manchester. The Staffordshire bull terriers were kept in cages at the house of breeder Amanda Hart and her family. One man, believed to be a family member, had to be physically restrained from running into the blaze, Humberside fire service station manager Paul Clucas said. 'When the owner arrived back, he was obviously distraught and tried to get into the property to save the dogs. I had to physically restrain him for his own safety. There was no chance, flames were coming out of the hall and the roof,' he said. Scroll down for video . Up to 25 dogs have been killed in  Hornsea, east Yorkshire after a fire at the home of Amanda Hart last night . The wooden structure was already well ablaze by the time firefighters reached the scene . The fire,  on Graingers Road, Hornsea, east Yorkshire, happened in a wooden-structured property, which was 'completely destroyed', a spokesperson for Humberside Fire and Rescue Service said. The cause is not yet known. Mrs Hart and her husband had put the dogs in cages and left to go to the supermarket when the fire engulfed their home and the kennels. The family are said to be fine, other than inhaling smoke while trying to save the animals. They are now staying with her parents in a bungalow, it says on a Facebook page set up to raise money for the family which already has more than 900 likes. One owner had to be physically restrained from running into the fire to try and save the dogs . The cause of the fire is currently unknown, but the dogs are believed to have died after inhaling toxic fumes . A message on the page, which calls on Staffordshire terrier lovers to unite and help Mrs Hart and her family, reads: 'She [Mrs Hart] has lost everything and as you can imagine her world has been taken from her. A Staffordshire bull terrier like the ones killed in the fire at an east Yorkshire home . 'I feel at this moment in time we as friends and fellow Stafford lovers need to band together as one to help one of our own who has lost everything to help rebuild her life again. We as a breed have always shown when the chips are down for one of our own we would without hesitation provide the blanket of support which is so desperately needed at this time. I will with the help of other friends be putting in place various ways of donating money and household items to assist Amanda and her family to survive this tragedy.' One commenter has offered to give Mrs Hart a puppy with the same bloodline as her dogs, so that the can continue to breed from the same family once her life has been set back up. And Eric Galvin, chairman of Merseyside Staffordshire Bull Terrier Club, has pledged £1,000, saying that he hopes 'this will open other clubs' bank accounts'. Firefighters reported the building to be 'well-alight' by the time they arrived, after being called shortly before 7pm yesterday - 18 attended the scene and stopped the fire from spreading further, but could not save any of the animals. The dogs are believed to have died after inhaling toxic fumes. A fundraising page set up last night has already raised more than £700 - exceeding the £500 target. Well-wishers donating to the tragic Manchester Dogs' Home saw more than £1.2 million pledged in less than 48 hours after the suspected arson attack on September 11. A similar fire at Manchester Dogs' Home on September 11 killed 60 dogs, with another 150 rescued . X Factor judge Simon Cowell was one of many who donated to a fund to rebuild the shelter . Overwhelmed staff were forced to tell people donating supplies to stay away from its sister site in Warrington, Cheshire, after the weight of public benevolence caused tailbacks on the M6 motorway and around Warrington. A 15-year-old boy arrested on suspicion of starting the blaze has since been released on bail. After more than 30 firefighters began to tackle the blaze, hundreds of people rallied round to provide refreshments, animal food and other help for the dogs that were rescued. The Hapurhey hire killed 60 dogs, while another 150 had to be rescued. Dog-lover Simon Cowell was one of many who gave money to a fund which aims to rebuild the shelter, donating £25,000. He also vowed to take the three men who rescued the surviving dogs from the blaze on a luxury holiday. On Monday staff from the home, many of them dressed in uniform, joined around 300 members of the public and wept at Christ Church in Hapurhey, near the gutted dogs' home, as Reverend Mike McGurk led a service paying tribute to the animals.","Staffordshire bull terriers were kept in cages and owned by private breeder .

"By . Corey Charlton for MailOnline . President-elect Ashraf Ghani (pictured) will succeed Hamid Karzai, who has been in power since the Taliban was ousted in 2001 . Former finance minister Ashraf Ghani has been named Afghanistan's president-elect after he signed a deal to share power with his opponent - ending months of turmoil which has destabilized the nation. The announcement withheld the final election numbers, apparently as part of the political deal between Ghani and rival Abdullah Abdullah, a former foreign minister who claimed the process was rigged against him. 'The Independent Election Commission of Afghanistan declares Dr. Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai as the president of Afghanistan,' commission chief Ahmad Yousuf Nuristani said. He added the full results would be provided at a later date, but did not specify when. He acknowledged deep flaws in the June 14 run-off vote and said a U.N.-supervised audit was not adequate to weed out all the vote-rigging. 'Although the audit was comprehensive (it) could not detect or throw out fraud completely.' Under the terms of the unity government deal signed on Sunday, Ghani will share power with a chief executive proposed by Abdullah. The two will share control over who leads key institutions such as the Afghan army and other executive decisions. The new administration faces huge challenges in fighting an emboldened Taliban-led insurgency and paying its bills amid plummeting tax revenue. The crisis has further destabilized Afghanistan just as the US-led military coalition prepares to withdraw most foreign troops at the end in the year, leaving Afghan forces to fight the Taliban insurgency. Teams from both sides had met late into Saturday night with United Nations representatives to try to finalize a power-sharing deal before today's scheduled announcement of the final election results after a U.N.-monitored audit and recount. Although the results of the audit have not been released, both Ghani and Abdullah had claimed to have won the fraud-tainted election, and the United Nations has pushed hard for a 'national unity government' to avoid a return to the ethnic divisions of the 1990s civil war. The last sticking point was how to announce the results of the audit. Aides and officials have said candidate Abdullah, a former foreign minister, had insisted that the official percentages either not be made public at all or be altered to give him more votes. Abdullah, left, and Ghani, right, signing the power sharing agreement at the presidential palace in Kabul today . The two shake hands after the prolonged standoff following the election, during which both sides accused the other of fraud . 'Both camps have agreed 100 percent on everything and we'll sign the deal tomorrow. Everything has been initialed and there is no disagreement on anything,' said Faizullah Zaki, a spokesman for Ghani. Mujib Rahimi, spokesman for Abdullah, also confirmed a deal had finally been struck, but did not give any details. Preliminary figures released in July put Ghani, a longtime World Bank official, ahead with 56 percent of the vote, prompting street protests from supporters of Abdullah, who alleged massive fraud and said he was the rightful winner. The final sticking point in negotiations was over an audit of official polling figures and whether they should be made public . A ruling coalition between the opposing camps is likely to be uneasy after a bitter election that has revived some of the ethnic loyalties of the civil war that led to the Taliban taking power in Kabul in the 1990s. Abdullah, a former anti-Taliban resistance fighter, draws his support from Tajiks and other northern ethnic groups. Ghani, an ex-World Bank economist, is backed by Pashtun tribes of the south and east. But Ghani's spokesman said the power-sharing pact had been secured and that details would be released at a signing ceremony on Sunday, without giving a time. After the June run-off election was engulfed in fraud allegations, the United States brokered a deal in which the two candidates agreed to abide by the outcome of an audit of all eight million ballot papers and then form a national unity government. But Abdullah later abandoned the audit, saying it was failing to clean out fraud. He won April's first round, only to see Ghani come from well behind and win in June. The new administration will have to stabilise the economy as international aid falls, and deal with worsening unrest nationwide. Efforts to open a peace process with the Taliban failed under Karzai and may be revived. A total of 2,312 civilians were killed in the first eight months of this year, an increase of 15 percent from 2013. About 41,000 NATO troops remain in Afghanistan, down from a peak of 150,000 in 2010, fighting alongside Afghan soldiers and police against the fierce Taliban insurgency. NATO's combat mission will end in December, with a follow-on force of about 12,000 troops likely to stay into 2015 on training and support duties. The dispute ruined hopes for a smooth democratic transition to replace Karzai, who has held power since the Taliban's hardline Islamist government was ousted in 2001 with U.S. military support, and threatened to rekindle the ethnic tensions that had plunged Afghanistan into civil war in the 1990s. Abdullah derives much of his support from the ethnic Tajik and Hazara communities, while Ghani is widely supported by the Pashtuns, the largest ethnic group. Final election results have been delayed for weeks to await an audit of all 8 million ballots cast in the June 14 run-off vote between Ghani and Abdullah, the top finishers in the first round in April. The audit was part of a deal brokered in July by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry to try to avert a descent into violence. Afghanistan's presidential election candidate Ashraf Ghani, right, leaves after signing a power-sharing deal as outgoing president Hamid Karzai, left, stands at the presidential palace in Kabul . The accord signed today is the finalisation of a broader power-sharing structure brokered by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who swiftly welcomed its signing. 'These two men have put the people of Afghanistan first, and they've ensured that the first peaceful democratic transition in the history of their country begins with national unity.' One of Ghani's first acts would be to sign a long-delayed bilateral security agreement with the United States, as he has previously declared support for the pact to allow a small force of foreign troops to remain in Afghanistan after 2014. There is a risk that any instability could be exploited by neighbours, like Pakistan, whose past involvement in Afghan affairs have played a part in the conflicts that have dogged Afghanistan for decades. 'A difficult and challenged unity structure is still preferable to conflict between these two groups,' said a U.S. official in Kabul. Abdullah (left) and Ghani pictured at the ceremony which confirmed their power sharing agreement what was the first democratic transition of power in the country's history . 'Having them both working together within the government and direct their energies toward positive reform is again preferable to some of the alternatives.' Abdullah's accusations that the run-off election was rigged in Ghani's favour had raised fears of ethnic violence, which could have ignited a broader conflict. 'A spark could have dealt a strong blow to the political process, if today's deal had not happened,' commented Waliullah Rahmani, director of the Kabul Center for Strategic Studies. 'But, we have crossed that moment.' Ghani is expected to be sworn in as president in about a week, according to Karzai's spokesman Aimal Faizi. The settlement will also come as a relief for Afghans, who have watched the tortuous process play out since they first voted in April. Hamid Karzai has ruled since soon after the Taliban government was ousted by U.S.-backed Afghan forces in late 2001, and the drawn-out election was meant to mark the first democratic transfer of power in Afghanistan's troubled history. 'Afghanistan will now be able to move forward for the next five years, even though it is not an ideal government,' Rahmani said.","Rival candidates finally reach a power sharing deal after months of tension .

First year students arriving at Oxford and Cambridge for undergraduate degrees have been told to attend a lecture on sexual consent before beginning classes, it has emerged. A series of 30 minute workshops at Cambridge will be included in Freshers' Week itinerary in a bid to get newcomers talking about the difference between consensual and non-consensual sex, while Oxford is holding classes in 20 of its colleges. At the end of the sessions, an official will read out a statement which describes consent as 'active and willing'. Scroll down for video . Sexual consent lectures have been included in the Fresher's Week itinerary at Oxford and Cambridge university (file image) It comes after police dropped an investigation into a former Oxford Union president who was accused of rape. Ben Sullivan was arrested last year after being accused of sexually assaulting a student. The 21-year-old was released after being held in a police cell for 12 hours without charge, then six weeks later told no further action was going to be taken. Amelia Horgan, one of those organising the workshops at Cambridge, told the Guardian: 'We are sending out a very clear message with these workshops that sexual violence is not welcome within the university community.' No students will be forced to attend, though organisers say the sessions will be useful as there is a lack of sex education in schools. Oxford University (pictured) is hosting sessions in 20 of its colleges for first-time students to learn about sexual consent . Classes at Cambridge University (Trinity College is pictured) will also be included in the Fresher's Week itinerary . 'A lot of people come to university with a very, very basic sex education which stems from sheer biology,' said Caitlin Tickell from Oxford University's women's campaign. Staff at Oxford are also drawing up a campus-wide anti-harassment policy after reviewing the existing rules. It comes after an apparent spread in lad culture which has increased poor treatment of female students by men in sports teams and societies.","World renowned universities to hold compulsory classes on sexual consent .

"By . Gemma Mullin for MailOnline . A gang who stole Audis worth £200,000 to strip for parts have been jailed after their sophisticated car cutting den was raided by police. Akhtar Zamir, Khuram Razaq and Nakash Javaid took four cars in five days from homes in Birmingham, Coventry and Solihull in the West Midlands. The men were able to steal security data from on-board computers using a key-copying device and programming the information onto blank keys. Gang members Akhtar Zamir, 25, (left) and Khuram Razaq (right), 23, from Birmingham, were jailed for four years eight months and three years six months respectively after they admitted conspiracy to steal cars . Nakash Javaid (left) and Carlos Hemmings (right), both 26, admitted conspiracy to handle stolen goods and given a 25 month and 24 month prison sentence when they appeared at Birmingham Crown Court on Tuesday . Car cutters Wayne Williams, 32, (left) and Thomas Winkett, 26, (right) both from Brierley Hill, West Midlands,  were jailed for 20 months each. The pair dismantled the cars at an industrial unit in Lye and fled in a taxi . They were helped by accomplice mechanics Thomas Winkett and Wayne Williams who dismantled the cars at an industrial unit in Lye. But undercover police followed them to the unit where Zamir, Razaq and Javaid were arrested on October 4, 2013. Officers stopped Williams and Winkett in a nearby taxi after they tried to flee, while later that day associates Carlos Hemmings and Adam Leek were intercepted whilst travelling north on the M6 in a van crammed with panels from one of the stolen Audis. The gang was jailed for a combined total of 17 years after they appeared at Birmingham Crown Court on Tuesday, September 16. The court heard unit owner Javaid ran a car wash and part-worn tyre business as a front to the crooked enterprise . They had piled a wall of tyres high against the entrance to the cutting workshop to conceal it from the public. The gang stole two Audi R5s, an A5 and A4 from outside homes in West Midlands in the space of five days. Pictured are the cars in the cutting workshop in Lye where the parts were stripped by accomplice mechanics . They used a key-copying device to steal security data from on-board computers before they were stripped . In the early hours of September 26, 2014 they stole an Audi A4 from Cheylesmore and three days later drove off in an A5 parked at a house in Edgbaston. Later the same evening Razaq sent a text message to Zamir saying ‘fne me [phone me] found a present’ referring to an RS5 he had spotted on a driveway in Willenhall, which was stolen in the early hours of September 30. And at 1.40am on October 1, CCTV captured members of the gang snatching another RS5 from The Village Hotel in Solihull. Sergeant Glenn Marriott, in charge of Operation Transmission, a West Midlands Police taskforce set up to target ‘key-less’ car thefts, said: ‘Members of the group toured residential streets on the look-out for top-end Audis and, having identified a target, would return in the early hours to steal them using a key-programming gadget. ‘It was a sophisticated set-up and the group worked quickly to strip down the stolen cars and move on the parts. The court heard the gang toured the streets looking for top-end cars and returned in early hours to steal them . Hemmings and Leek were intercepted on the M6 in a van crammed with panels from one of the stolen Audis . ‘In fact, body panels recovered from the van on the M6 were from an RS5 stolen in Coventry just 14 hours earlier. ‘Police intelligence and covert enquiries identified the Lye unit as being pivotal to the operation and when we raided it we caught them red-handed with the car parts and diagnostic equipment for programming blank keys.’ He added: ‘Operation Transmission has enjoyed huge success in the 18 months since it was set-up. ‘During that time we’ve arrested more than 160 car theft suspects and recovered around £2.5-million worth of stolen vehicles.’ Zamir, 25, and Razaq, 23, both from Sparkbrook, Birmingham, admitted conspiracy to steal cars and were jailed for four years eight months and three years six months respectively. Javaid and Hemmings, 26, both from Sparkhill, Birmingham, admitted conspiracy to handle stolen goods and were jailed for 25 months and 24 months respectively. Car cutters Williams, 32, and Winkett, 26, both from Brierley Hill, West Midlands, admitted the same handling conspiracy charge and were jailed for 20 months each. Leek, 31, from Yardley, Birmingham, admitted handling stolen goods and was given a suspended 12-month jail sentence and ordered to carry out 200 hours’ unpaid work.","Akhtar Zamir, Khuram Razaq and Nakash Javaid took four cars in five days .

"By . Nadeem Badshah . The BBC has come under fire after new figures showed spending on taxis for staff at its Broadcasting House headquarters has soared by nearly 60 per cent. A Freedom of Information Request has shown it spent £116,000 on fares in 2013-14 - compared with £73,000 in 2012-13. Critics say employees should turn to public transport more after the cost of transporting staff to and from the building went up by more than £40,000. The BBC has come under fire after new figures showed its spending on taxis for staff at its Broadcasting House headquarters has soared . The number of staff in the central London building has grown from 1,260 in 2012 to about 4,500 employees in 2013 and the BBC say the spending per head on taxis has more than halved as a result. But Jonathan Isaby, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'This is an enormous amount of money and the big increase shows that the BBC can tighten its belt. 'Though some of these journeys would have been unavoidable, in many cases public transport must have been an alternative. 'The licence fee is too high and cutting these costs could mean they could reduce the licence fee and give hard-pressed families a break.' Over the past two financial years, staff made around 47,000 expense claims including for taxi journeys. It covers the period when the BBC moved employees from their old office, Broadcasting House in west London, to the new headquarters in Oxford Circus. The figures come just days after it emerged that spending on expenses rose during Lord Hall of Birkenhead's first year as director-general in 2013, despite a cost-cutting drive . The figures come just days after it emerged that spending on expenses rose during Lord Hall of Birkenhead's first year as director-general in 2013, despite a cost-cutting drive. Senior managers spent around £66,000 wining and dining TV stars and other contacts. And expenses for the corporation's most senior executives rose by seven per cent in Lord Hall's first year to around £691,000. The broadcaster says that the cost per head of taxi fares fell to £26 in 2013/14 compared to £58 the previous year and among senior managers, their taxi bill is down seven per cent from last year. A BBC spokeswoman said: 'As we have closed some of our old buildings, staff numbers have more than trebled in Broadcasting House. 'These figures actually show that the amount we spend on taxis per person in central London has more than halved, delivering better value for the license fee payer.'","BBC underfire after spending on taxis for Broadcasting House staff rockets .

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . We know all about Superman, Spider-Man and Batman - but now Essex has a 'superhero' of its own - and his power is challenging stereotypes. 'The Gimp Man of Essex' walks around towns dressed in a full rubber bondage suit - used in sexual activities such as bondage, discipline, domination, submission, sadism and masochism (BDSM). He wants to start a public debate about sexual stereotypes, and is raising money for charity as he goes. Fetish-friendly fun: 'The Gimp Man of Essex' is raising money for charity and challenging stereotypes . Sexual healing: He donates £1 to charity every time someone uploads a picture with him to his Facebook page . Changing attitudes: Gimp Man wants to help people to think more openly about sex and fetishes . Every time someone stops to take a picture of him and posts it to his Facebook page - which has more than 2,500 likes - he donates £1 to mental health charity Colchester Mind. He has raised more than £800 so far - with one anonymous person donating £500 to his JustGiving page yesterday, along with the message: 'Love this - what an inspiration. Congratulations, and keep up the good work!' Much like his superhero counterparts, 'Gimp Man' likes to keep his identity a secret - not even his wife and children know about his fetish-friendly exploits. Mind of matter: He has raised more than £800 for mental health charity Colchester Mind so far . Man about town: He has been spotted all over Essex, including the towns of Colchester and Clacton . BDS-ATM: Just because he is wearing a gimp suit doesn't mean Gimp Man can't go about everyday tasks . He does not go out at weekends or during school holidays, and says most of the reaction he gets from people on the streets is positive and friendly - though he does occasionally get branded 'a paedophile or pervert'. 'Most people are very welcoming when I tell them what it's all about,' he told the BBC. 'I don't go round to scare the life out of people. 'People call me a legend, but I only donate a few hundred quid and walk round looking a fool.' The superhero we need right now: The fetishist likes to keep his true identity hidden . Gimp Man says he is 'adult enough' to realise that people will see the negatives in everything, but it is these people's perceptions he is hoping to change. 'People are a lot more open minded nowadays. And at the end of the day, you can walk along the beach and see a lot more than I'm exposing!' he said. Gimp Man's jaunts around the streets of Colchester, Clacton and other Essex towns were not initially a charity venture - it was only when someone suggested to him that he could raise some money that he decided on the idea of helping Colchester Mind. The charity's chief executive, James McQuiggan, says they are very grateful for all of his support and donations.","Essex man wants to challenge stereotypes on sex and fetishes like BDSM .

"By . Nick Craven for The Mail on Sunday . The Co-op Bank has been accused of ‘blatant sexism’ after downgrading the role of a female high-flyer whose affair with its chief executive posed a conflict of interest. Last week The Mail on Sunday revealed that headhunter Samantha Davenport, the bank’s ‘Head of Talent’, is in a relationship with married boss Niall Booker, despite having a key role in appointing the directors and chairman supposed to hold him to account. The Co-op admitted there was a ‘potential’ conflict of interest and said it would take steps to tackle it. Last week The Mail on Sunday revealed that headhunter Samantha Davenport, the bank’s ‘Head of Talent’, is in a relationship with married boss Niall Booker (pictured above) But the troubled bank’s solution was to strip 44-year-old Miss Davenport of any role in the appointment process for the board – a move condemned by MPs and City women’s groups as ‘discriminatory and unjust.’ Tory MP Nadine Dorries said that the Co-op had failed to uphold its own ethical standards. ‘The fact they have stripped her of responsibility and let him carry on is blatant sexism. We are entitled to expect more from a bank which holds itself up as “ethical”.’ She added that it was a chief executive’s job to be aware of potential conflicts of interests; so it was his duty to report the affair to his board, not hers. Lindsay Loxley of the Women in Business Network agreed, saying: ‘It’s discriminatory and unfair – it’s always the woman who has to make the compromise. It’s sexist.’ And Gwen Rhys of campaigning group Women In The City added: ‘This is a sorry tale and both parties were rather naive if they thought that their affair wouldn’t have negative consequences. ‘But quite why Ms Davenport should take the “hit” of having her job watered down while Mr Booker can carry on unaffected doesn’t, on the face of it, strike me as equitable.’ A spokesman for Co-op Bank said last night: ‘Sam Davenport now has no role in the recruitment of the new chairman and future directors at the bank. Affair: Last week, we revealed that on a working Friday, Mr Booker, 55, and  Miss Davenport emerged from her west London home at 2.30pm and turned up at their office in the City at 3.30pm . ‘This decision is role-based, not gender-based, and there is no question of sexism. If the Head of Talent had been a man and the CEO a woman, then it would have been the man whose job would have been slightly impacted.’ How The Mail on Sunday reported the news that the married  Co-op bank chief was having an affair . Despite its claims to the contrary, the Bank also felt the conflict of interest was serious enough to report it to the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. Neither the Bank nor the FCA would comment on whether that step was taken before or after our report. Last week, we revealed that on a working Friday, £2.9 million-a-year Mr Booker, 55, and divorced mother-of-three Miss Davenport emerged from her west London home at 2.30pm and turned up at their office in the City at 3.30pm. The Co-op’s handling of the issue echoes a similar situation at insurance giant Aviva in 2009 . Then its £1.8 million-a-year chief executive Andrew Moss had an affair with colleague Deidre Galvin, who was married to the company’s human resources chief. Shortly before the affair emerged, only Miss Galvin resigned ‘by mutual agreement and in order to avoid any apparent conflict’.","Last week The Mail on Sunday revealed  headhunter Samantha Davenport is in a relationship with married boss Niall Booker .

"By . Freya Noble for Daily Mail Australia . Imagine writing off a car worth almost half a million dollars. Now imagine it wasn't even yours. That's the reality for one unlucky man who totalled his mate's $400,000 Lamborghini in Sydney on Saturday night. While cruising through EdeNsor Park in the city's west, the driver of the charcoal V12-powered Lamborghini Murcielago came over the crest of a hill and ploughed into another car. Scroll down for video . This Lamborghini Murcielago was written off on Saturday night when it ploughed into another car . That other vehicle, a white Honda SUV, was turning into its driveway, Nine News reported. The 2007 model Lamborghini is completely written off as confirmed to the program by the car's driver, Vince, who said: 'Yeah it's a write off, there's nothing left of it'. The Honda, driven by Kathy Barillaro, also looked a little worse for wear after it rolled 20 metres and came to a stop further down the street. The driver of the other vehicle Kathy Barillaro survived unscathed after her Honda SVU rolled for 20 metres down the road . The 2007 model car was only purchased last weekend by two men who split the $400,000 price tag . Ms Barillaro was lucky and was only treated for minor injuries such as cuts, bruises and whiplash by paramedics at the scene, but did not suffer anything more serious. 'I don't know what happened, and I was just rolling and rolling and rolling', she said. 'All I heard was this loud bang, it sounded like a plane crash really', Kathy's husband Bruno Barillaro said. The driver of the Lamborghini, Vince, said the crash totally wrote off the luxury sports car . Police are investigating the crash but no one has been charged . Vince said that he had purchased the car in partnership with a friend, and they had only picked up the car last weekend. He also added that he wasn't too concerned about the car and was glad everyone involved in the accident was largely unharmed. Police told Daily Mail Australia they are investigating the incident and the possibility that speed was a factor, but no charges have been laid.

That number could rapidly grow to tens of thousands. And if the outbreak is not stopped now we could be looking at hundreds of thousands infected,' he said. 'This is an epidemic that is not just a threat to regional security. It’s a potential threat to global security if these countries break down, if their economies break down, if people panic.'

"By . Ruth Styles . From 'Grow your own Christian Grey' novelties to mugs, love scrolls and more, there's no shortage of merchandise cashing in on the Fifty Shades Of Grey trilogy. Despite the variety, most have come without the blessing of author E.L James - until now. The best-selling writer has collaborated with Swedish fashion house KappAhl to create a range of lingerie based on the book. Available in sexy black satin and elegant grey lace, the firm say the items are full of references to the book's characters, Christian Grey and Anastasia. Scroll down for video . Glamorous: Plus size model Signe Nordstrom looks chic in her Fifty Shades Of Grey lingerie and mask . Looking good: The new range includes bras, briefs, negligees, dressing gowns and a kinky lace mask . The range includes bras, briefs, . negligees, dressing gowns and the inevitable kinky mask - all available in a 'a choice of materials and silhouettes to suit women of . all shapes and sizes', according to KappAhl. Speaking about the new range, E.L James said: 'It has been incredibly exciting and interesting to be involved in the process, from the production of the concept through the design to the final collection. 'I have been deeply involved at all stages, and my thoughts and suggestions are clearly visible in the collection's garments.' It is thought the author was also involved in the choice of model, which unusually for a lingerie campaign, features a plus-size woman. Input: Author E.L James worked with KappAhl on the line and says her influence is apparent in the design . Elegant: According to KappAhl, most of the range comes in shades of grey with a dash of black and crimson . Her name might not trip easily off the tongue but chances are, you've seen Swedish plus size model Signe Nordstrom before. Prior to landing the 50 Shades campaign, the 5ft 11, size 12 - 14 model, who hails from pretty Marstrand in West Sweden, starred in a major TV ad for Special K. Other campaigns include work for Lova Weddings and Marisota. According to plus size agency 12+, model, Signe Nordstrom, a size 12 to 14, boasts the 'statuesque physique and natural beauty [that makes her] perfect in the role of the femme fatale that the campaign wants to show.' The fashion world obviously have a very different conception of the phrase 'plus size' because she looks very svelte indeed to us. Carina Ladow, vice president of range and design at KappAhl, said: 'Both E L James and KappAhl felt that it was . important for all women to be able to feel comfortable and beautiful . while wearing the garments. 'Not surprisingly, the garments come in . shades of grey with complementary colours such as red and black. The . garments are embellished with lace details for a romantic feeling.

"By . Katy Winter . A yoga teacher is trying to change the face of the discipline and in the process says she has found a new self-awareness… by deliberately gaining 40lbs. Trina Hall, a yoga instructor based in Dallas Texas, embarked on a diet she describes as ‘see it, eat it’ to gain the weight, and blogged about her experience . The 34–year-old began to gain weight after hearing a friend and fellow yogi crying over her fear about been known as the ‘fat yoga teacher’. Trina had a healthy, moderate diet and was a typically slim, fit yoga instructor before she began her project, and believed she didn't really care about her weight . Trina Hall after she purposefully gained 40lbs to challenge notions of the perceived 'yoga body' Trina, who has taught yoga for over six . years, says on her blog: ‘I was taken aback by this statement because I . would classify her as beautiful, fit, and trim. I wanted to explore her . statement. ‘I thought this would be an experiment in empowering people to love their bodies and not try to fit society’s mould.’ Instead of her usual health-conscious diet, she told US News she began to eat exactly what she pleased - which included plenty of Mexican food . At 5ft 5in, Trina’s weight soon rose from around 130lbs to about 170lbs, a move which she admits might be thought of as ‘career suicide’. 'I want to slay the notion that people who do yoga need to look like the beauties on the cover of magazines’ Trina explains. However, rather than the reaction of others to her changing shape, which Trina says was minimal, it was the effect of the weight gain on her own sense of self-worth that had the most impact. On her blog she explains: ‘Guilt from eating foods I typically considered bad for me were constant companions in my thoughts. ‘The stories I made up about what people thought of me were changing and I was emotionally affected. Suddenly, my self-worth was proving to be connected to how good I looked wearing spandex – something I completely denied caring about before this experiment – and that pissed me off. Tina admits: ‘My most shocking discovery through the process is that I’m afraid of not being loved. I noticed the self-talk was that my beauty is only on the surface. I feared no man would want me this way and that I would die alone, probably from choking on a potato chip.’ Trina found that the most profound effect of her weight gain was on her own sense of self-worth . Tina ended her experiment in July and has resumed her usual healthy diet. However she has refused to weigh herself - and insists she has not given up Mexican food! When asked what lessons she had learned from her experiment she told US News: ‘I thought my identity was about how I treated people and the actions I took to make the world a better place. But those things were only a piece of my identity. ‘I learned that I was – and still am – very judgmental about physical appearance. I was afraid of dying alone – I noticed that was a thought coming into my mind. ‘I'm single, and the thought kept coming in, ""You're going to die alone. You're going to die alone."" ‘And so I started to see that I had that thought process, that fear of not being loved, even when I weighed much less.’","Trina Hall, 34, deliberately gained weight by going on a 'see it, eat it' diet .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . When Andrew Britton fell ill on his honeymoon, he chalked it up to a wedding-based hangover. But nine months, three hospitals and six cardiac arrests later, he is now awaiting a heart transplant after his body was ravaged by a virus. Mr Britton, 33, collapsed hours after arriving in the Maldives with his wife Lauren, also 33, last November. Andrew Britton (right) developed myocarditis shortly after marrying his wife Lauren (left). He was on his honeymoon in the Maldives when his condition rapidly deteriorated. He is now waiting for a heart transplant after spending nine months in three different hospitals . The keen triathlete and squash player . initally blamed it on a hangover, or some dodgy plane food – but his . condition swiftly deteriorated. Within days, he had lost two stone and was transferred to a hospital in Bangkok, Thailand, where he was put on life-support. ‘I . finally came round and was so confused,’ he said. ‘I pointed for a pen . and paper and wrote: “Did I die?” I later learned I had five cardiac . failures in the Maldives, and a sixth a few days later.’ When he first fell ill, Mr Britton’s wife called for the local doctor, and her husband was eventually put on a drip in his hut. Island doctors told Andrew they had 24 hours to get him to a specialist heart hospital in Bangkok (pictured there during his recovery) or he would die. He was flown there on an emergency medical jet and remained on life support for two weeks and in the hospital for a total of six weeks. The . next day the couple took a boat to the nearest hospital, where Mr . Britton was found to have a heart rate of 200 beats per minute. He was . then sedated and given defibrillation shocks. ‘It all happened completely out of the blue and was absolutely terrifying,’ Mrs Britton recalled. Myocarditis is a viral infection that leads to inflammation and damage to the heart. The majority of cases clear up within a week, but sometimes the inflammation in the heart lasts longer. Symptoms include chest pain, fever, an irregular heartbeat and shortness of breath. There’s no reason why someone with an infection may develop myocarditis - it is often a case of bad luck. Many . people don’t realise it, but common bacterial and viral infections such . as flu, ear and chest infections, and even the common cold can get into . the bloodstream and affect the heart, explains consultant cardiologist . Dr Nigel Durham of York Hospital. ‘It’s . more widespread than we’d thought  - a quarter of patients we see aged . 30 to 35 have evidence of myocarditis, and it is the most common cause . of sudden adult death. Myocarditis . can be mild and sometimes resolves itself - if the condition is spotted . quickly, anti-inflammatory drugs can treat it. But . once the heart muscle becomes enlarged, causing it to stretch, there is . little that can be done and it can lead to heart failure. ‘I was on the phone to family and friends back at home most of the time, who really kept me going.’ Mr Britton said: ‘At one point our medical insurance hadn’t kicked in and our credit cards were maxed-out. ‘Lauren . had been given a security escort from the hotel, and he saw the . situation was so serious that he gave the hospital the deeds to his . house as security against my treatment.’ Doctors . warned Mr Britton, a director of InterContinental Hotels, that he would . die unless they got him to a specialist heart hospital in Bangkok . within 24 hours. Thankfully, he was flown there on an emergency medical . jet, and was placed on life-support for two weeks. His . other organs began to fail as doctors worked out which drugs would . combat the virus; when his kidneys stopped working, hospital staff . drained 11 litres of fluid from his body. However, . after several weeks he became stable enough to fly home, and was taken . to Harefield Hospital in north-west London. ‘I was told I had picked up a . virus which attacked my heart and caused it to inflame, which is . incredibly rare,’ he said. Staff fitted him with a cardiac . resynchronisation therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) to moderate the pace of . his heart. ‘ . I was . eventually able to leave the hospital and was at home for seven weeks, . but I collapsed at Tesco and was taken back,’ he said. Mr .

"By . Katy Winter . Think of a sex shop and what comes to mind is a slightly seedy store on the local high street, populated by large-breasted mannequins in sleazy lingerie and men in raincoats. Sally Tyne, 49, from Worcester got so fed up with the awkwardness she felt when buying sex toys that she's launched her own, tasteful website to bypass the smut. Whistle&Hum aims to provide a smut free shopping experienced for women looking to explore their sexuality . The Je Joue MiMi vibrator is a elegant pebble shaped external vibrator . Whistle&Hum is a website with an innovative approach to sexuality and sex products. A calming white and pastel landing page greets visitors to the site, with not a hint of red, black or semi-naked ladies in provocative poses. ‘Welcome to the smut-free but light hearted world of whistle&hum. We promise to keep things simple and straightforward; we will never talk about sex toys, pink furry handcuffs, fifty shades of nylon lingerie or twelve inches of kinky pleasure and we will never, ever encourage you to wear PVC’ The simple layout and discreet symbolic pictures aim to calm and reassure the nervous shopper . The simple layout and discreet symbolic pictures (think flowers, towels on beds, and of course, rabbits) aims to calm and reassure the nervous shopper. Alongside unassuming and rather elegant vibrators, the site also sells Kegel toys to help women strengthen pelvic floor muscles, lubricants and even aromatherapy products. All the products are of a higher standard than you might expect to find in your average sex shop. The lubricant is organic lavender, ‘free from parabens, glycerin or glucose, silicone and petrochemicals’ and vibrators are all top of the range. All this discretion and quality does of course mean the price tags are a little higher than usual, with some vibrators costing over £100, and lubricant £15 for 118ml. However the site offers an experience for women fed up with an erotica industry that subjugates women’s needs. There is a section on Whistle&Hum dedicated to answering questions on types of toy, how to use them, and even more general issue like menopause, vaginismus and stress incontinence. Founder of Whistle&Hum and former primary school teacher for children with special needs, Sally Tyne, 49, says: 'Many, many years ago rabbit vibrators were in the news, there were rabbit references everywhere and I decided to buy one. ‘I ordered it from a woman’s magazine. It arrived and, ready to scale new heights of pleasure, I unpacked it. That rabbit gave me shivers of horror! ‘Made from lots of plastic parts, there was a section containing tiny balls and another bit which cranked around; it made more noise than my washing machine. ‘My chap examined it in a detached technical sort of way, wondered whether it was safe and declared, “I wouldn’t put that anywhere near my undercarriage!” My fling with a vibrator was over before it began. ‘An unspoken gauntlet had been laid down,  I wanted to find the right website for me and the women around me. Whistle&Hum provides a discreet and helpful way to purchase high quality sex toys, but prices are a little higher than on the high street . Whistle&Hum also sell aromatherapy products, as well as offering advice on a number of issues effecting women's sexuality and sexual health . Those who are confused over what type of vibrator might work best for them can be gently guided through the choice . ‘We reminisce, tell stories, our sexual side is part of our lives and holds its own small place alongside family, jobs, home and a thousand other things that make us who we are. But where was our website? 'At Whistle&Hum we don’t like the smut that surrounds them and we don’t like the feeling that buying a vibrator makes you one step away from pouting in a gold lamé body stocking with a stranger lashed to the bed. 'We do however, like the idea of women having somewhere safe and comfortable to go if they are thinking about buying a vibrator, or if there is a niggling something that is hindering their sexual enjoyment. We promise to offer women straightforward information in a clean, upfront and honest way. Whistle&Hum is for all women - every age, size, background - who want to think about their sexual health and wellbeing.'","Whistle&Hum aims to provide a stress and embarrassment-free experience .

"By . Emma Innes . Surgeon Manjit Bhamra is still practising, despite the NHS forking out close to £2million for botched operations . The NHS has paid out more than £2m in compensation to victims of a surgeon who is still allowed to work. Rotherham Hospital has agreed damages settlements for four former patients of orthopaedic surgeon Manjit Bhamra, totalling just over £1m since last summer. Previously 13 other patients had received a total of £1,058,784. The latest payments of £1,005,000 include a single payment of £830,000, the highest individual claim so far settled. Rotherham Hospital admitted liability in all four of the recently settled claims, while another 22 claims were withdrawn. Of the 17 payouts so far, the hospital has accepted liability in 10 and made no admission in the other seven. Despite the huge amount of public money paid in compensation, an Information Tribunal recently ruled Rotherham Hospital was right not to disclose information relating to its concerns about Mr Bhamra's work on the grounds that it was the surgeon's ‘personal information’. The General Medical Council cleared the surgeon of any wrongdoing in 2011 and he retains a full medical licence and is working at another Yorkshire hospital. The GMC declined to comment on how it reached its decision. The claims against Mr Bhamra largely involve hip, knee, elbow and shoulder surgery he carried out at Rotherham Hospital where he worked full-time up to 2007 and then part-time until 2009. A small number of claims involve Mr Bhamra's work at Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust, where he has worked at Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield since 2009, and Goole Hospital where he worked on an ad-hoc basis. Mid Yorkshire has said it has no concerns about Mr Bhamra's practice, insisting it undertook robust checks when employing staff. Lawyers representing former patients of Mr Bhamra have agreed a protocol with the NHS to help process the large number of claims. A further 94 claims currently remain to be processed under the protocol. Rotherham Hospital (pictured) has agreed damages settlements for four former patients of the orthopaedic surgeon . The settled claims so far range from £1,750 up to £830,000, with a total of £2,063,784 paid out. The money is paid by the NHS Litigation Authority (NHSLA) which co-ordinates negligence claims on behalf of health trusts who each pay into the scheme. Rotherham Hospital admitted negligence claimed by Wayne Pickering, 60, from Cantley, Doncaster, who had a hip operation in February 2006. Mr Pickering's claim alleged the surgeon fractured his pelvis and damaged the sciatic nerve, leaving him with an unstable hip and seriously impaired mobility. Tim Annett, from Irwin Mitchell solicitors who are representing the majority of claimants, said: ‘While some cases have already settled, a special protocol has been set up with the NHSLA and investigations are on-going to find out exactly what happened during the treatment of our remaining clients and ensure that any potential lessons are learnt to improve patient safety in future.’ Rotherham Hospital declined to comment on the recent settlements or on how much it envisaged being paid out in total.","£2million of compensation has been paid out to Manjit Bhamra's patients at Rotherham Hospital .

"By . Michael Zennie . Half of the United States population resides in 146 very large urban and suburban counties clustered around the nation's most populous cities. The remaining 157million Americans are scattered through the country's 3031 smaller counties, boroughs and parishes - many of them rural . Business Insider used U.S. Census data to point out the intriguing urban-rural divide and developed a map to illustrate the point. The map shows not only where the large cities are located, but how large their suburban footprint is. Population centers: This is the map that reveals the 146 counties that are home to half of the country's population . Densely-populated: In the northeast, the string of heavily-populated counties runs, almost uninterrupted, from northeast Massachusetts and Boston to northern Virginia and the Washington area. Southern California counties are dramatically larger, by comparison, but also include a similar string of unbroken suburban growth . The largest 146 counties range in population from Los Angeles County - with 9.8million people - to Williamson County, Texas, - a bedroom community for Austin, with 455,000 people. The map offers one metric to show the suburban sprawl in the country that isn't always translated by examining city or metropolitan area population . For example, the Phoenix metro area is the 13th largest in the country. Maricopa County - where Phoenix is located - is the third largest in the nation. With 3.8million people, Maricopa . County is home to more souls than the entire city of Chicago and more . than any single borough of New York City - including Manhattan. It also shows that the footprint of many cities sprawls much farther than the city itself. Miami is home to only 413,000. Dade County, though, is the 7th largest county in the nation, with 2.4million souls. Detroit, . which has made headlines for its rapidly-declining population, still . commands high density in its home - Wayne County - and two other . suburban counties - Oakland and Macomb. The 2010 U.S. Census reveals that American are increasingly clustering around large cities. 1. Los Angeles County, California -  9.8M . 2. Cook County, Illinois - 5.2M . 3.

McPherson County, Nebraska - 539 . 9. Grant County, Nebraska - 614 . 10. Loup County, Nebraska - 632 . About 80percent of the nation lives in settings that government defines as 'urban' - that includes areas that don't have high enough population to make the Business Insider list. The U.S. Census data comes as a government report shows plummeting birth rates across the U.S. have finally leveled out after decreasing for the past four years. The number of babies born last year, a little less than 4 million, is only a few hundred less than the number in 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report released on Friday shows. This suggests fewer couples are scared away from having children because of the economy or other factors, some experts say. One, Brady Hamilton, a statistician with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said: 'We may be on level course or potentially even see a rise in birth trends in the near future.' The report also showed that the birth rate for women in their early 30s has also increased for the first time since 2007. Births were on the rise since the late 1990s and hit an all-time high of more than 4.3 million in 2007. The drop that followed was widely attributed to the nation's flagging economy. Experts believed that many women or couples who were out of work or had other money problems felt they couldn't afford to start or add to their family. The economy was officially in a recession from December 2007 until June 2009, but polls showed most Americans remained gloomy, citing anemic hiring, a depressed housing market and other factors well into 2011.","Population clusters gathered around major cities including Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Chicago ."
"By . Bill Bond . EU inspectors have found indications of tobacco smuggling from Gibraltar into Spain after the Spanish government claimed if all of the cigarettes imported to the enclave were legal every citizen would be smoking nine packs a day. The EU's Fraud Office - OLAF - has now written to the Spanish and British governments urging judicial investigations, according to reports in the Spanish press today. The letters state: 'There are reasons to believe that the crimes of tobacco smuggling and the laundering of capital affecting the financial interests, or of another nature, of the European Union have been committed in Gibraltar,' said the reports. A team of EU inspectors have found that there are indications of tobacco smuggling from Gibraltar into Spain, it has been reported (file picture) The letters were sent to the Spanish Treasury and to the United Kingdom's permanent representative at the EU to be 'transmitted to the Gibraltar authorities', at the end of last month,the reports state. The OLAF conclusions followed public visits by inspectors from the European Commission to Gibraltar and the town of La Linea on the Spanish side of the frontier in September 2013, July this year, and an unreported visit in March this year. The inspections came following complaints by the British and Gibraltarian governments about Spanish customs and police checks on the border frequently causing delays lasting hours. Spain repeatedly countered that the checks were necessary because of massive cigarette smuggling across the frontier from the Rock and the use of Gibraltar's banking system to evade Spanish taxes and launder EU money. The European Commission's recognition of illegal activities on the frontier was a 'triumph for the Spanish government' reported El Pais, the country's most read daily newspaper. Gibraltar, with a population of less than 30,000, imported 117 million packets of cigarettes in 2013, reported El Pais. The newspaper quoted a Spanish government official as saying: 'Every Gibraltarian, including unweaned babies, would each have to smoke nine packets a day.' Cigarettes in Gibraltar cost almost half what they do in Spain. Gibraltar, with a population of less than 30,000, imported 117 million packets of cigarettes in 2013, reported El Pais (file picture) The State Prosecutors office at the National Criminal Court in Madrid has said that it was opening an investigation into cigarette smuggling and money laundering in Gibraltar following the OLAF report, a copy of which reached the court at the beginning of this month. The court had jurisdiction because they were crimes committed by Spanish subjects abroad, an official told the national newsagency EFE. A recent law banned the court from handling cases outside Spain unless Spaniards were involved either as suspects or victims. A dramatic increase in tobacco smuggling from the Rock into Spain over the past four years indicated that organised crime was involved, said the official. Figures supplied by the Spanish Foreign Ministry claimed that the number of packets of cigarettes seized on the frontier rose from 636,499 in 2012 to 971,463 last year. And in the first two months of this year 137,815 were seized.","EU inspectors find indication of tobacco smuggling from Gibraltar into Spain .

"By . Martha De Lacey . Jill Greenberg is bored with the 'controversy' rumbling around her photographs. The portrait artist's beautifully stylised and highly emotive images of very young, damp-cheeked children sobbing up close to her camera lens drew accusations of 'child abuse' when they were first seen in 2006. But the New York-based mother-of-two, who has now released a collection of the photos as a stunning hardback art book with D.A.P. and Madrid-based TF Editores, says she had no intention of creating such a stir with her images, and was shocked to have actually received hate mail as a result of them. The Truth: Jill Greenberg's photos depict crying children but were intended to reflect her dissatisfaction with Bush-era politics in 2006 . The Rapture Index: Jill Greenberg used her daughter, her daughter's friends and some child models in the photos . Speaking to MailOnline, Greenberg said: 'Children at that age cry as a form of communication since they can't use their words, its not evidence of pain.' 'Making children cry for a photographer can be considered mean,' she continued in Slate Magazine. speaking to Jordan G Teicher. 'But I . would say that making children laugh and show off their jeans for an . apparel ad is just as exploitative and less natural. Toddlers' natural . state, like 30 per cent of the time, is crying.' To get the children welling up, Greenberg and the infants' mothers would offer the tots sweets and chocolate or something just as tantalising, such as a mobile phone, then stop short of handing them over, prompting a tantrum. In a statement about the collection on her website, Greenberg says: 'Nothing is more pure than the anguish of a child. Pictures of children crying capture raw emotion: sputtering rage and profound loss. 'In many ways we’ve become desensitized to disturbing image. But the honesty of a child's feelings is undeniable and it draws you in to the photograph. Perhaps because kids experience the kind of powerful emotions that we, as adults, have suppressed in ourselves.' Greenberg said: 'Children at that age cry as a form of communication since they can't use their words, its not evidence of pain' In a statement about the collection, Greenberg said: 'Nothing is more pure than the anguish of a child. Pictures of children crying capture raw emotion: sputtering rage and profound loss' Continuing, she wrote: 'The children I photographed were not harmed in any way. And, as a mother, I am quite aware of how easily toddlers can cry. Storms of grief sweep across their features without warning; a joyful smile can dissolve into a grimace of despair. 'The first little boy I shot, Liam, suddenly became hysterically upset. It reminded me of helplessness and anger I feel about our current political and social situation. 'It made me think of my outrage at our false reasons for going to war in Iraq and the scandalous way in which the conflict was sold to the American people. I thought of George W. Bush, then just sworn into his second term in office, and I decided to call the image ""Four More Years"". Shock: 'The first little boy I shot, Liam, suddenly became hysterically upset. It reminded me of helplessness and anger I feel about our current political and social situation' She said: 'As a parent I have to reckon with the knowledge that our children will suffer for the mistakes our government is making. Their pain is a precursor of that is to come' 'As any new parent will tell you, the future suddenly becomes a very serious concern. As ecstatic as I was at the birth of my daughter, I felt selfish bringing her, and later my son into our screwed-up world. I seemed to become a mother at exactly the moment things went awry. 'Of course, human beings have always been greedy, violent and dishonest. But the rise of the Christian right as a political force in this country has made the situation dire. The most dangerous fundamentalists aren’t just waging war in Iraq; they're attacking evolution, blocking medical research and ignoring the environment. 'It's as if they believe the apocalyptic End Time is near, therefore protecting the earth and the future of all our children is futile. As a parent I have to reckon with the knowledge that our children will suffer for the mistakes our government is making. Their pain is a precursor of that is to come.' Trillions: 'As any new parent will tell you, the future suddenly becomes a very serious concern. As ecstatic as I was at the birth of my daughter, I felt selfish bringing her, and later my son into our screwed-up world' Speaking to Slate magazine, she said: 'Making children cry for a photographer can be considered mean... but a toddler's natural state, like 30 per cent of the time, is crying' Faith? 'The children I photographed were not harmed in any way. And, as a mother, I am quite aware of how easily toddlers can cry' Jill Greenberg isn't the only parent to have snapped children at their most teary moments. The father behind hit Tumblr photo blog Reasons My Son Is Crying has been exploring the 'universal culture of toddler' using photos of his two sons - and the children of people from around the world - sobbing. Greg Pembroke, from Rochester, New York, began taking mid-tantrum photos . of his infant sons Charlie, 22 months, and William, three-and-a-half, . and captioning the images with the (mostly unreasonable) reasons for the . boys' tears.

'The . best bit is that I've been getting emails from all over the world from . people saying they find it so relatable. It doesn't matter where in the . world you are, the universal culture of toddler is the same.' He continued: 'Some . of the funniest contributions I've had are one from Australia with a . picture . of a little boy crying his face off because his mother unwrapped a . chocolate biscuit.

"By . Ruth Styles . His mother is famous for her chic sense of style, while his Aunt Pippa is no stranger to making fashion headlines of her own. Now it would appear that Prince George's grandmothers are making a bid for the title of most fashionable female relative after both put in strong performances at his christening. Camilla, who exchanged an air kiss with the Queen as she arrived at the Chapel Royal at St James' Palace, looked wonderful in an all-cream ensemble, complete with a cosy bouclé coat and a multi-strand pearl necklace.

Royal couple: The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall leave St James's Palace after the christening . Looking good: New grandmother Carole Middleton arrives for the christening of Prince George . Meanwhile, the Duchess of Cambridge's mother Carole, who arrived a few minutes ahead of the royal party, was resplendent in a Catherine Walker designed off-white dress and tailored navy coat livened up with a chic lace panel. Perfectly-groomed Carole, who smiled broadly as she arrived for the intimate ceremony accompanied by husband Michael and children Pippa and James, teamed her coat with a soft grey satin trimmed straw hat by milliner Jane Corbett. Both grandmothers plumped for comfortable low-heeled leather court shoes that kept attention firmly on their outfits, . The pair joined the Duchess of Cambridge, who looked elegant in a cream ruffled suit by Alexander McQueen and a £755 bespoke Jane Taylor hat, and other members of the royal family including Prince Harry and the Queen, for the event, which was attended by just 22 people. But although it was Prince George's big day, all eyes were on his grandmothers - both of whom have raised their style game in recent years. Camilla's understated, regal style has been finessed since her 2005 wedding to Prince Charles, with designers such as Anna Valentine and Bruce Oldfield taking pride of place in her wardrobe.

The majority of the duchess' hats are bespoke and the work of some of the UK's biggest millinery names, among them Phillip Treacey and Nerida Fraiman, who also makes hats for her nieces Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie. By contrast, Carole Middleton shares her eldest daughter's thrifty approach to fashion with much of her wardrobe purchased on the high street. Like her daughters Kate and Pippa, Carole has a penchant for Whistles and Zara, but is known to splash out on occasion. At the 2011 royal wedding, Carole plumped for Catherine Walker, who also designed her ensemble for the christening of Prince George, and chose a flattering Orla Kiely tea dress for her first meeting with her grandson at the Lindo Wing in June.

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . Up to 100,000 African elephants could be killed by illegal poachers in the next decade, it has been revealed. About 500,000 elephants currently reside in Africa after an estimated 22,000 were massacred across the continent last year. But this figure could be slashed by 20 per cent if illegal hunting continues at its current rate, says a new report. Scroll down for video . Shocking: The corpse of an elephant which was killed by cyanide at a game reserve in Zimbabwe, south Africa . Devastation: More than 300 elephants died in the mass poisoning at Hwange National Park in September . Alarmingly, this may result in the animals becoming extinct in some parts of Africa. The report was released today at opening of the African Elephant Summit in Botswana's capital Gaborone, which was convened by the Botswana government and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It shows a staggering 25,000 elephants were illegally poached across the continent in 2011. Last year's killings - resulting in a slightly fewer 22,000 deaths - took place at 42 sites across 27 countries in Africa, says the report by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Horrific: Up to 100,000 African elephants could be illegally poached in the next decade, says a new report . 'With an estimated 22,000 African elephants illegally killed in 2012, we continue to face a critical situation,' said John Scanlon, CITES's secretary general. 'Current elephant poaching in Africa remains far too high, and could soon lead to local extinctions if the present killing rates continue.' Elephants in Central Africa are bearing the brunt of the poaching - with the estimated hunting rate twice the continental average. However, high poaching levels in all sub-regions mean that even large elephant populations - as seen in southern and eastern Africa - are at risk unless the trend is reversed, said Mr Scanlon. In danger: Rising demand for ivory is believed to have sparked an increase in illegal poaching in recent years . In September, more than 300 elephants were killed by cyanide in Zimbabwe's Hwange National Park - described by the IUCN as the 'worst single massacre in southern Africa for 25 years'. The animals were struck down when . ‘salt licks’ next to pools where they drank and bathed were contaminated . with the deadly chemical. The rising demand for illegal ivory in developed nations - as well as poverty and weak governance - are believed to have sparked an increase in elephant poaching in recent years. Today's summit was being convened to agree on policies to end the illegal ivory trade and secure viable elephant populations across Africa. These include strengthening national laws to tackle wildlife crime and enhancing cooperation between countries.","Only 500,000 elephants currently reside in Africa due to illegal poaching .

"By . Damian Spellman, Press Association . Wilfried Zaha is confident he can re-launch his career under Neil Warnock after announcing his return to Crystal Palace in style. The 21-year-old, who joined Manchester United from Palace in a £15million switch in January last year, headed back to Selhurst Park on loan last week having made only a handful of appearances for his new club. He was introduced as a 70th-minute substitute at St James' Park and was to have the final say in a dramatic conclusion to an eventful 3-3 draw as he demonstrated the talent which attracted United in a thrilling cameo. VIDEO Scroll down for Neil Warnock on Wilfried Zaha and potential signings . Thumping: On-loan Manchester United winger Wilfried Zaha came off the bench to make his second Crystal Palace debut and snatch a point for the Eagles in a draw at St James' Park against Newcastle United . Zaha told Palace's official website, www.cpfc.co.uk: 'He (Warnock) has come in and said he doesn't want to change too much really. 'He's let us get on with it and told me to do what I do. He's seen me play before, so he allowed me to go out there and express myself. 'I haven't really played too much, so coming off the bench I don't mind because I'm getting my fitness back. But I'm definitely looking forward to starting a few games. 'I had to make the move here because I wasn't getting minutes on the pitch, so coming back here will definitely push my career forward.' Zaha's strike came five minutes into seven minutes of stoppage time at the end of the game and after he had seen an earlier effort correctly ruled out for offside and been denied twice by Magpies keeper Tim Krul. He said: 'To be honest, I'd missed way too many chances before that, so I'm buzzing to get the goal. High five: Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock (second left) congratulates scoring substitute Wilfried Zaha . 'Since I came back, I've been comfortable and everyone has shown me love around the place. All I need to do is get settled again and get playing. It's always great to play and I feel at home doing that here with players I've played with before. 'I go back home and my dad gives me advice and what I have to do in the next game, so I'm comfortable and I'm happy.' If Zaha claimed the headlines on the pitch, Warnock did so off it as his second spell in charge unfolded in topsy-turvy fashion. Palace were ahead within 30 seconds when Krul could only turn Marouane Chamakh's shot on to the post and Dwight Gayle slammed the rebound into the roof of the net. It took Newcastle, who had failed too register in either of their opening two Barclays Premier League fixtures, until the 38th minute to break their duck when full-back Daryl Janmaat bundled home from close range with the help of a series of ricochets and a deflection off Damien Delaney. Hugs all round: Scott Dann (left) embraces goalscorer Wilfried Zaha (right) who came off the bench to score . However, having started the first half dozily, Alan Pardew's men were guilty of the same offence in the second, allowing Jason Puncheon time and space to tee up Yannick Bolasie's pass before volleying it across Krul and into the far corner. Minutes after Warnock had turned to Zaha, Pardew handed 18-year-old Rolando Aarons his chance, and the Jamaica-born midfielder very nearly won the game for the home side. His 74th-minute back-post header after Remy Cabella's corner had flicked off defender Scott Dann restored parity, and when his curling 89th minute shot came back off the post, Mike Williamson supplied the final touch to claim his first goal in more than five years. That should have been enough to claim a first league victory of the campaign, but a lack of discipline and concentration handed Zaha his chance, and he took it with aplomb. Pardew, who has himself considered Zaha as a potential signing in the recent past, was understandably disappointed at the result, but confident for what lies ahead. He said: 'I think we have got a good group. I think we have still got things to do going forward. 'I think against the better teams, we are probably well set, but we need to find ways through - maybe that bottom half of the Premier League is where we are going to have to be a bit more patient and show a bit more quality.'

"By . Richard Arrowsmith for MailOnline . John Guidetti has revealed he was so delighted at sealing a loan move to Celtic from Manchester City that he started dancing in a coffee shop. The Hoops were given special dispensation to sign the 22-year-old on Thursday despite the late arrival of some of his paperwork. Speaking exclusively to the official Celtic website, Guidetti said: 'It's really nice to be part of Celtic. Cheshire grin: Manchester City striker John Guidetti was delighted at sealing a loan move to Celtic . Dream move: Guidetti leaves Celtic Park after talks with the Scottish champions over a season-long loan . 'I was standing in a coffee house when I got the news and I was actually dancing because I was so happy. I really was buzzing. 'Everybody knows what a great football club this is, especially in Sweden when Henrik Larsson was playing there. It's also a very well-known club because of the fans, who are so passionate and brilliant. 'Even the people at City told me about the European nights. They said it's the best atmosphere in the world. People just don't say that for no reason and it must be true because I've heard it from so many places.' The Swedish striker has promised Celtic fans he will give nothing less than 100 per cent during his stay at Parkhead. Pecking order: The Swedish striker has struggled to cement a place at City following his arrival in 2008 . 'I know so much about Celtic. As soon as the club came for me I knew straight away, Celtic is the one and that's where I want to go. 'I spoke to the manager and I felt a good connection with him and that Celtic was a club that knew about me and were genuine about what they liked, which is so important. 'With a good manager and good fans and players, you can never go wrong. 'I'm just going to work my socks off to try to do my absolute very best every game and give 100% because that's what the fans deserve. Who's the boss? Guidetti revealed that he formed an instant connection with manager Ronny Deila . 'I'm very passionate and the one thing I hate more than anything is losing. I can't stand it. 'It doesn't matter whether it's ping pong or football. And in football for 90 minutes I am always giving everything and trying to do my absolute very best for the whole game. 'Sometimes you can have a better game, sometimes a bad game, but you can always expect 100% from your players and I'm going to give that.' Guidetti, who joined City from Swedish side IF Brommapojkarna in 2008, spent the second half of last season on loan at Stoke where he mustered six appearances without scoring. He had a far more prolific spell with Feyenoord three years ago when he notched 20 goals in 23 appearances. Hard act to follow: Another Swedish striker Henrik Larsson was a legend at Celtic . And the Swedish forward knows he faces a challenge to follow in the famous footsteps of players including Henrik Larsson, Johan Mijalby and Mikael Lustig. He added: 'I know Johan Mjallby very well and Henrik Larsson's son well and I spoke to Henrik a couple of times. I know what the fans are expecting but Henrik was an amazing striker and they are very big shoes to fill but I promise will do my very best to do even a little bit of what he did. 'It's a lot to live up to and I'm going to do my best. 'They just told me what a great club it is and it's not for no reason that Henrik stayed for so many years. He was very much wanted in Europe, we all know that, because later he went to Barcelona and Manchester United, but he stayed because it was an amazing club to play for and that tells you all you need to know about Celtic.'","Manchester City star John Guidetti has completed season long to Celtic .

"By . John Hall . An artist has created sculptures of some of Britain’s most iconic landmarks - out of chips and mushy peas. Prudence Staite, 33, and her team of assistants used 10kg of chips to make edible versions of the London Eye, Big Ben, Stonehenge, the Angel of the North and the White Cliffs of Dover. Ms Staite, from Gloucestershire, said her chip art required a 'perfect combination' of chip shop chips and oven chips for each sculpture, and just the right amount of mushy peas to create the surrounding landscapes .

'Iconic landmarks in Britain are so important to our cultural history and eating chips is such a British tradition that it felt natural to combine the two and create some history of our own. It did leave us a little hungry though,' she added. Stu Baker, of the Potato Council, said: 'Britain is truly a nation of chip lovers and Chip Week is a fantastic celebration of our great food tradition. 'We always enjoy the creativity and ingenuity that Chip Week tends to inspire and Prudence has certainly taken it to a whole new level...So why not go to your local chippy and have a try yourself?'

"By . Daniel Martin . Clive Peedell, English doctor specialising in clinical oncology. He claims the 'bribes' are 'outrageous' Bupa has been accused of ‘bribing’ its patients with up to £2,000 to use the NHS rather than private hospitals. The medical insurer offers financial incentives to those who agree to have heart, cancer or gynaecological surgery in Health Service hospitals. One campaigner said Bupa was ‘dumping’ these patients on the NHS because the procedures they need are the most expensive – meaning the company can save money and accumulate higher profits. The firm denied this, saying the money given out in the ‘NHS cash benefit’ offer was  simply a rebate because the patients were not accessing the private care their health insurance policies could provide. But Labour said the company was simply putting increased pressure on the Health Service, which was already overburdened. The party’s health spokesman, Andrew Gwynne, called on the Government to hold a probe into the impact of BUPA’s payments. He said: ‘To many people, these payments will feel like bribes. ‘Private companies are increasingly cherry-picking patients and treatments they consider lucrative, leaving the NHS to pick up the bill for the most difficult services.’ John Lister, of pressure group Health Emergency, said private healthcare firms were ‘milking the NHS’. ‘The operations they are offering to pay people to have on the NHS are the ones they are least equipped to deal with … Bupa has realised these operations are the most expensive and are now dumping these patients on the NHS,’ he said. ‘NHS hospitals are already struggling to cope with less staff and fewer resources. The burden of extra patients needing complex operations will cause significant problems … it’s scandalous.’ Bupa has been accused of dumping patients on the NHS so they can avoid the most expensive surgeries . The controversial offer was revealed in a letter from Bupa to a cardiac patient, which said the payment of between £500 and £2,000 ‘takes the place of private treatment funding’. Dr Louise Irvine, a GP in south-east London, said: ‘The NHS is effectively subsidising the private sector because these private health insurers can charge a smaller premium in the knowledge the NHS is there to deal with anything complex and costly.’ Dr Clive Peedell, co-leader of the National Health Action Party, said: ‘This is an outrageous example of how the private healthcare sector is happy to take patients’ money but then turns to the NHS when it realises it can’t afford to meet the cost of treating patients privately. ‘It looks like Bupa calculated that it’s cheaper for them to pay patients to use the NHS than fork out themselves for private treatment. They are cashing in on the NHS.’ The firm has 3million UK customers and last year made £139million profit. A Bupa spokesman said less than 1 per cent of eligible members had taken up the offer, but added: ‘Our customers tell us that being able to choose where to have treatment … is important. ‘They may choose to receive treatment in the NHS instead of using their health insurance because, for example, they may live close to an NHS hospital with excellent cardiac or cancer treatment facilities. ‘Or they may require or value some extra financial support over private treatment due to their personal circumstances. ‘If they choose NHS treatment, we offer them a cash payment because they have not claimed on their health insurance policy for this treatment. ‘They can then use this for the other substantial costs that can mount up when people have serious illnesses, such as childcare, travel to and from hospital or the need to pay for extra help around the home.’","Bupa accused of dumping patients on NHS for most expensive procedures .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . and Wills Robinson . ISIS are making nearly $1million a day selling off crude oil from conquered refineries to Kurdish businessmen. The jihadists, who now call themselves the Islamic State's caliphate, are smuggling the resources from Iraqi oilfields into Turkey and Iran where they offer it up for $25 (£15) a barrel, making a huge profit. The lucrative trade was revealed as the Iraqi government were accused of killing 255 Sunni prisoners as revenge for the ISIS advance, which has seen them take large swathes of the country. Industry experts believe the fighters are taking the oil from plains south of Mosul and transporting it in tankers, owned by the extremists, so it can be turned into diesel and petrol. Smuggling: Oil tankers, owned by the Islamic State, transport petrol to to be sold to Kurdish businessmen . Lucrative: The jihadists are said to be . Accused: Human Rights Watch has said Iraqi security forces, such as those pictured, killed prisoners when they took back territory from ISIS militants . 'Outrageous violation': The rights watchdog accused the Iraqi forces of committing war crimes . According to The Daily Telegraph, the looting is based in the town of Tuz Khurmatu on the fringes of the Kurdish region. Iraqi oil industry analyst, Shwan zulal said the militants were using their control of a 150-mile swathe of territory to take crude oil from some of Iraq’s prime oil assets. He told the paper: 'In some ways it’s as easy for Isis as digging a hole and letting the oil run before siphoning it off into tankers for transportation and Baiji is a huge complex that it may not fully control but it can take supplies.' The prisoners who were killed came from a rival Muslim denomination to the Shi'ite Iraqi army, were fleeing the violence when they were recaptured and killed, according to human rights campaigners. Human Rights Watch (HRW) brought to light reports of Iraqi armed guards breaking prisoners' arms and legs and shooting them in the head, as well as tossing grenades into cells with inmates inside. It was claimed that eight of the victims were boys who were less than 18 years old. The attacks were thought to be revenge by the Iraqi forces after ISIS took huge swathes of the country in the face of startlingly little resistance. It was widely reported that ISIS added to the chaos around its lightning advance last month by letting inmates loose from Iraqi jails, in the hope they would join their insurgency. The watchdog listed five incidents where Iraqi are believed to have carried out the killings, drawing on testimonies from government workers, hospital staff and lawyers. The accounts include reports of handcuffed, blindfolded and burned bodies being dumped into a ravine near Mosul, Iraq's second city, which was overrun by ISIS on June 9. On the run: Most of the prisoners, who were not combatants, were fleeing from the violence caused by advancing ISIS forces (pictured), HRW claim . Revenge: HRW says the attacks were retribution for the huge gains made by ISIS when they rampaged across the north of Iraq in June. Pictured is a triumphant ISIS fighter holding their flag . Another account speaks of guards bursting into prison cells and opening fire with AK-47s, killing more than 50 people, including teenage boys. In a further incident, the watchdog cites testimonies that prisoners whom Iraqi officials said died in crossfire were in fact killed 'execution-style' by vengeful commanders after an assault. A spokesman for HRW said: 'Gunning down prisoners is an outrageous violation of international law.' 'While the world rightly denounces the atrocious acts of ISIS, it should not turn a blind eye to sectarian killing sprees by government and pro-government forces.' The organisation has demanded an international inquiry be held into the alleged killings. ISIS themselves, whose forces now call themselves The Islamic State, have been subject to a tide of condemnation after footage of their own mass executions emerged. Executions: ISIS themselves has also been attacked for carrying out even more brutal executions, such as the ones from mid-June pictured above where militants marched up and down rows of bodies shooting them . Firing squad: However, HRW said that the brutality of ISIS does not excuse Iraq forces of adopting similar tactics in their fight against them . One man was shown being forced to kneel by the roadside before he was shot in the back of the head, while other gruesome pictures emerged of militants marching up and down rows of prone bodies apparently firing machine guns into them. The claims against Iraqi forces came as their grip on the country slipped further with the advance of Kurdish security forces into disputed oil fields. The takeover of the Bai Hassan and Kirkuk oil fields were the latest land grabs by Kurds, who have responded to ISIS by seizing more territory of their own. Kurdish fighters known as peshmerga pushed into the city of Kirkuk, a major hub for the oil industry in the north, and the surrounding area weeks ago. Territory: Kurdish-controlled Kirkuk, pictured, was hit by car bombs yesterday, killing dozens of people . Aftermath: Security forces stand guard this morning after the attacks just outside of the disputed city . But until now they had not moved into the oil fields themselves. On Friday, however, the fighters took over the Bai Hassan and Kirkuk fields and expelled local workers, the Oil Ministry in Baghdad said. Oil Ministry spokesman Assem Jihad denounced the move as 'a violation to the constitution' and warned that it poses 'a threat to national unity.' The Kurdish Regional Government said its forces moved to secure the fields after learning of what it said were orders by officials in the Oil Ministry to sabotage a pipeline linking oil facilities in the area. It said production would continue, and that staff can return but will operate under Kurdish management. Ties between Kurds and the central Baghdad government are rapidly unravelling as the country fragments in the face of the Sunni militant blitz, led by Islamic State extremists. Expansion: The accusations came as peshmerga fighters from the autonomous Kurdish region of Iraq took control of lucrative oil fields just outside the city of Kirkuk . The country is effectively being cleaved along ethnic and sectarian lines - the swath of militant-held Sunni areas, the Shiite-majority south and center ruled by the Shiite-led government in Baghdad and the Kurdish north. The United States and other world powers, as well as Iraq's top Shi'ite cleric, have pressed for a more inclusive government that Iraqis of all stripes can rally around. On Friday, Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani again urged lawmakers to move swiftly toward a compromise, calling on them to 'rise above selfish aims.' He said: 'The challenges ... threaten civil peace and the unity of the social fabric and forecast a divided and disputed future for Iraq.'","Jihadists are smuggling resources from conquered oilfields south of Mosul .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Can you draw a map of the entire world from memory? You’ve probably seen it countless times - in travel guides, weather reports and at school - but recreating it on paper can be trickier that you think. That’s what 30 students from Michigan found out when they were asked to draw the world’s continents without an atlas to guide them. Most people missed the UK, New Zealand, Madagascar, Scandinavia, Greenland, and a huge chunk of the Indian subcontinent. The black and white map, compiled by Reddit user zaaakk, is a combination of 30 drawings done by students who were asked to draw the continents from memory. As well as layering the images on top of one another, zaaakk created a mockup that spliced his distorted map with geographic details captured from Nasa satellites . The size of Indonesia and the Philippines shrunk dramatically, and there was only a tiny glimpse of Antarctica in some of the drawings. Australia, Alaska and Japan didn’t always make the cut either, and there was some debate as to how big Canada and Russia were in relation to each other.

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A 22-year-old man has been charged with the rape and murder of a five-year-old girl whose burned body was found in an abandoned house. Darnell Cheatham had been dating Mariha Smith's aunt around the time he is accused of brutally attacking her in July 2011. The Detroit, Michigan man had been a suspect from the moment Mariha's body was found, with her skull crushed, but police didn't have enough evidence to convict him until Monday. Charged: Darnell Cheatham, pictured at a 2011 hearing, has been charged with murder, arson, torture and child abuse over the death of five-year-old Mariha Smith . Snatched: Mariha was taken from her Burlingame home in the early hours of July 24, 2011, then assaulted and killed . Cheatham is accused of snatching Mariha . from the house she shared with her mother, Konesha, and aunt, Quanita, . who he was in a relationship with. He has been charged with first-degree premediated murder, felony murder, arson, torture, child abuse, and dismemberment and mutilation of a body, the Huffington Post reported. Police believe he took the little girl at about 3.30am to an abandoned house a mile from her Burlingame home. He then allegedly raped and killed her, before setting fire to the mattress her body was left on. One of Mariha's brothers allegedly told police he saw Cheatham abduct his sister from the front room where they were sleeping. She was reported missing by her mother a few hours later and Mariha's body was found at 8am on July 24, 2011, after Detroit Fire Department was called to an abandoned house. Miss Smith said at the time she couldn't remember anything about the disappearance because she was passed out on a sofa. While the search for her daughter was still continuing, the then 24-year-old told CBS Detroit that she had last seen Mariha when the little girl and her three siblings settled down in the living room for the night. She has not yet commented on the charges made against Cheatham, but Mariha's grandmother said she was glad the child's killer had finally been caught. Horrific: The burned body of Mariha was discovered in this abandoned Detroit house near to her home . Footage: Security cameras caught a man believed to be Cheatham buying a can of gas on the morning Mariha died . Frantic: Just a few hours after Mariha's mother, Konesha Smith, reported her missing the little girl's burned body was found . 'I am so glad that they caught him and my grand baby can rest in peace,' Diane Henry told Fox 2. 'He may be locked up but he's still breathing. See, that's the problem - he's still breathing. He should suffer just like my granddaughter suffered.' When Mariha's body was found, her skull had been crushed and her body badly burned. The cause of death was asphyxiation. Assistant prosecutor Mark Hindelang asked that no bond be set for Cheatham because of the seriousness of the charges against him. 'This very difficult case was solved due to the diligence and tenacity of Wayne County prosecutors and Wayne County Prosecutor's Office investigators,' prosecutor Kym Worthy said. 'Much of the work was done on their own time to finally bring justice to little Mariha,' she added. When police started their investigation Cheatham was reportedly identified in CCTV footage that showed a man purchasing 41 cents of gasoline at 7.44am on the day Mariha was found. He was taken into custody, along with the child's aunt, Quanita, but although the couple both failed their polygraph tests, there was not enough evidence to hold them. Suspect: It took two years for police to collect enough evidence to convict 22-year-old Cheatham . Murder: Cheatham is accused of abusing and killing Mariha in an abandoned house near to her home . Connection: Mariha's aunt, Quanita, was in a relationship with Cheatham at the time of the five-year-old's abduction . It may have taken two years to press charges in the case, but residents in the neighborhood where little Mariha was killed has not forgotten the little girl who loved to sing. Outside the charred, abandoned house where her tiny body was found, piles of rain-soaked cuddly toys, left by well-wishers, fill the steps and path. Damara Hawkins, who lives just a couple of doors away from where Mariha was murdered, told the Detroit Free Press she thinks about the little girl every day. 'The whole situation is kind of a replay in my head because I can’t forget that day. It was very sad how everything happened,' the 18-year-old said. First-degree murder under Michigan law carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole, according to the Charlotte Observer. A preliminary hearing for Cheatham is due to take place on November 1.","Darnell Cheatham had been suspect from start but police didn't have enough evidence to convict him .

"By . Jason Groves, Deputy Political Editor In New York . David Cameron will plead with Iran for help in smashing Islamic State today as he prepares to order air strikes on the terror group. In a major diplomatic gamble, the Prime Minister will hold talks with Iranian president Hassan Rouhani in New York to discuss co-operation over the escalating crisis in neighbouring Iraq. The talks, due to take place at the United Nations today, are the first of their kind since anti-Western Islamic fundamentalists seized power in Tehran in the 1979 revolution. Islamic State has murdered three Western hostages in recent weeks and threatened to kill British taxi driver Alan Henning, who is currently being held . Mr Cameron will also meet Barack Obama to finalise plans for British involvement in US-led air strikes against IS fanatics. The terror group has murdered three Western hostages in recent weeks and threatened to kill British taxi driver Alan Henning, who is currently being held. MPs could be recalled to Parliament for an emergency session at the end of this week to approve RAF bombing raids. Iran is a close ally of the Shia-led government in neighbouring Iraq and is already involved in fighting IS extremists on the ground in the north of the country. But Tehran’s support for other terror groups, such as Hamas and Hezbollah, has made it an international pariah . Until now, it has been excluded from diplomatic efforts to build an international alliance against IS. British sources last night acknowledged that dealing with Iran will be fraught with difficulty, not least because of its support for Syrian tyrant Bashar al-Assad and its efforts to build a nuclear bomb. But Britain views Mr Rouhani as a relative moderate and officials believe it will be worth the risk of trying to co-operate to defeat IS. Mr Rouhani’s election last year has led to a slight thawing in relations between London and Tehran, which have been frosty for the past 35 years. The Prime Minister will hold talks with Iranian president Hassan Rouhani at the United Nations in New York to discuss co-operation over the escalating crisis in neighbouring Iraq . Iranian protesters set fire to the Union Jack and Israeli flag during a demonstration outside the British embassy in 2011 . Iran is seen as a key player in shoring up the new government in Baghdad, which is struggling to deal with the onslaught from the terror group. A senior Downing Street source last night said Mr Cameron would tell Mr Rouhani to drop his support for Assad, and warn him that developing nuclear weapons remains unacceptable. ‘We are under no illusion about the dangers of Iran’s nuclear programme and our approach on that is not changing,’ the source said. ‘However, if Iran is willing to join the international community to defeat IS, then we will work with them on that. ‘But we will be clear that you cannot take one approach in Baghdad and another Damascus. You need a political solution in both if you are serious about defeating IS.’ Britain and Iran have had a fractious relationship since the overthrow in 1979 of the Shah by Islamic radicals led by Ayatollah Khomeini. Britain suspended diplomatic relations after militants stormed the US embassy. The Iranians branded the US ‘The Great Satan’ and the UK ‘the Little Satan’. Ties were only resumed in 1988. Further trouble was caused by Tehran declaring a fatwa against Salman Rushdie and then by suspicions that it was trying to build nuclear weapons. In one of the most humiliating episodes in the Royal Navy’s recent history 15 British sailors and Marines were seized in 2007 in another confrontation. In 2011 Britain imposed sanctions to try to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions – a decision that led to the expulsion of the British ambassador and the storming of his embassy. However, relations have improved following the election of a moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, in 2013 and an agreement on how to deal with Iran’s nuclear ambitions. In June the embassy reopened. Mr Cameron is expected to hold separate talks with a string of world leaders over the next 36 hours in New York, as part of the drive to build a global alliance to destroy the terror group. These will include discussions with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi today on tackling the Islamist threat in his country. In a keynote speech to the UN General Assembly tomorrow night, Mr Cameron will call on the world to unite to tackle the rise of Islamic extremism. He is also expected to indicate that Britain is ready to join the US and France in carrying out air strikes against IS forces in Iraq, at the request of the government in Baghdad. But Number 10 is still weighing up the political, military and legal risks of extending any bombing campaign to attack IS bases in neighbouring Syria without the support of Assad. Downing Street has all but ruled out deploying regular British combat troops to take on IS. But Tony Blair yesterday warned that ground troops may be needed. In a 6,500-word essay setting out the case for war, the former prime minister called for a ‘willingness to take casualties’ and warned: ‘Airpower alone will not suffice.’","David Cameron will hold talks with Iranian president at the UN in New York .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard for MailOnline . The date of Earth's potential destruction has been set at 16 March 2880, when an asteroid hurtling through space has a possibility of striking our planet. Researchers studying the rock found that its body rotates so quickly that it should break apart, but somehow remains intact on its Earth-bound trajectory. They believe it is held together by cohesive forces known as van der Waals - and although this is considered a major breakthrough, scientists still don't know how to stop it. Scroll down for animation . The date of Earth's potential destruction has been set at 16 March 2880, when an asteroid hurtling through space has a possibility of striking our planet. Researchers studying the rock found that its body rotates so quickly, it should break apart, but somehow remains intact on its Earth-bound trajectory . The discovery was made by researchers at the University of Tennessee (UT), Knoxville. Previous research has shown that . asteroids are loose piles of rubble held together by gravity and . friction. The asteroid, named 1950 DA, is a rock . two-thirds of a mile in diameter, travelling at about 15 km (nine . miles) per second relative to the Earth. It is approximately 3,280ft (1,000 metres) in diameter, but rotates once every two hours and six minutes. At this rate, the rock should break apart and eventually disintegrate, but it is not showing any signs of doing so. In . fact, the rotation is so fast that at its equator, 1950 DA effectively . experiences negative gravity. If an astronaut were to attempt to stand . on this surface, he or she would fly off into space unless he or she . were somehow anchored. The presence of cohesive forces has been predicted in small asteroids, but definitive evidence has never been seen before. It is due to swing so close to Earth it could slam into the Atlantic Ocean at 38,000 miles per hour. It . is estimated that if 1950 DA were to collide with the planet, it would . do so with an force of around 44,800 megatonnes of TNT. Although . the probability of an impact is only 0.3 per cent, this represents a . risk 50 per cent greater than an impact from all other asteroids. However, the UT team found that the asteroid, called 1950 DA, is spinning so quickly . that it defies these forces. It is approximately 3,280ft (1,000 metres) in diameter, but rotates once every two hours and six minutes. At this rate, the rock should break apart and eventually disintegrate, but it is not showing any signs of doing so. Ben Rozitis, a postdoctoral researcher; . Eric MacLennan, a doctoral candidate; and Joshua Emery, an assistant . professor in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, wanted to . know what keeps the body from breaking apart. By calculating 1950 DA’s temperature and  density, the team detected the cohesive forces that stop it breaking up. 'We . found that 1950 DA is rotating faster than the breakup limit for its . density,' said Rozitis. 'So if just gravity were holding this rubble . pile together, as is generally assumed, it would fly apart. Therefore, . interparticle cohesive forces must be holding it together.' In . fact, the rotation is so fast that at its equator, 1950 DA effectively . experiences negative gravity. If an astronaut were to attempt to stand . on this surface, they would would be flung off into space. The presence of cohesive forces has been predicted in small asteroids, but definitive evidence has never been seen before. The findings, published in this week's edition of the science journal Nature, have potential implications for defending our planet from a massive asteroid impact. 'Following the February 2013 asteroid impact in Chelyabinsk, Russia, there is renewed interest in figuring out how to deal with the potential hazard of an asteroid impact,' said Professor Rozitis. ANIMATION: Asteroid 1950 DA's potential trajectory . A simulation of an asteroid impact tsunami developed by scientists at the University of California, Santa Cruz, shows waves as high as 400 feet sweeping onto the Atlantic Coast . 'Understanding what holds these asteroids together can inform strategies to guard against future impacts.' This . research reveals some techniques, such sending a massive object on a collision course with the . asteroid, could worsen the effects. The asteroid (pictured), is due to swing so close to Earth it could slam into the Atlantic Ocean at 38,000 miles per hour . For . example, this technique could get in the way of forces keeping . the asteroid together, causing it to break apart into lots of smaller, threatening asteroids that could be on a collision course for Earth. This . may be what occurred with the asteroid P/2013 R3, which was caught by . the Hubble Space Telescope in 2013 and 2014 coming undone, possibly due . to a collision with a meteor. 'With . such tenuous cohesive forces holding one of these asteroids together, a . very small impulse may result in a complete disruption,' said Professor Rozitis. The asteroid is travelling at about 9 miles (15km) a second relative to the Earth. It is due to swing so close to Earth it could slam into the Atlantic Ocean at 38,000 miles per hour. It is estimated that if 1950 DA were to collide with the planet, it would do so with a force of around 44,800 megatonnes of TNT. Although . the probability of an impact is only 0.3 per cent, this represents a . risk 50 per cent greater than an impact from all other asteroids. Over the long timescales of Earth's history, asteroids this size and larger have periodically hammered the planet. The so-called K/T impact, for instance, ended the age of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. Asteroid 1950 DA was discovered on 23 February 1950. It was observed for 17 days and then faded from view for half a century. Then, an object discovered on 31 December 2000 was recognised as being the long-lost 1950 DA. The New Year's Eve sighting was exactly 200 years to the night after the discovery of the first asteroid, Ceres. It was found that the asteroid 1950 DA has a trajectory that for a 20-minute window on March 16, 2880, a collision cannot be entirely ruled out. This graphic shows the orbits of all the known Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs), numbering over 1,400 as of early 2013. These are the asteroids considered hazardous because they are fairly large (at least 460 feet or 140 meters in size), and because they follow orbits that pass close to the Earth's orbit . Van der Waals forces are the attractive forces that hold molecules close together and are fundamental for chemistry, biology and physics. They arise due to attraction between oppositely charged areas of substances. The strength of Van der Waals' forces is related to the size of atoms and molecules.So the bigger the atom or molecule the bigger the Van der Waals' force. However, they are among the weakest known chemical interactions, so they are notoriously hard to study. But scientists claim there is no cause for concern. If it is eventually decided 1950 DA needs to be diverted, the hundreds of years of warning could allow a method as simple as dusting the surface of the asteroid with chalk or charcoal, or perhaps white glass beads. This would change the asteroid's reflectivity and allow sunlight to do the work of pushing the asteroid out of the way. Nasa is currently tracking all 1,400 potentially hazardous asteroids so far identified and predicting their future close approaches and impact probabilities. As part of this effort it is working on the development of an infrared sensor that could improve its asteroid tracking capabilities, dubbed the Near Earth Object Camera (NEOCam) sensor. Once launched, the space-based telescope would be positioned at a location about four times the distance between Earth and the moon. From this lofty perch, NEOCam could observe the comings and goings of near Earth objects, including PHAs, without the impediments such as cloud cover and daylight. The Near-Earth Object Camera (NEOCam) is a mission proposed to NASA to find potentially hazardous asteroids. The mission will use a new sensor, called the NEOCam chip, that has more pixels and better sensitivity than previous generations of infrared sensors .","Asteroid 1950 DA has a 0.3 per cent chance of hitting Earth in 867 years .
A possible impact date for 1950 DA is on 16 March, 2880, scientists say .
If it hits, it would do so with a force of 44,800 megatonnes of TNT .
But scientists say there is no cause for concern as the risk is low .

These forces have never been spotted on an asteroid before .

"By . Alex Brummer for the Daily Mail . Tesco’s slide from global grocery champion to chain store chump has been so rapid it takes the breath away. It was perhaps understandable that it would go through a difficult transition after the brilliant Terry Leahy departed in 2011. A more pedestrian chief executive, Phil Clarke, was fired in July after three miserable years in the job. But the problems the company revealed yesterday are of an entirely different order. Tesco  accounts for £1 in every £8 spent in British shops but has now seen its share price drop by 40 per cent . It’s deeply shocking to discover that Britain’s largest retailer has been rigging its profit figures to make them look better. In the context of Tesco – whose profits, before tax, last year totalled £2.8billion – a mistake of £250million may not appear that overwhelming. The company still dominates British grocery, with 28.2 per cent of the total market, and has operations stretching from South Korea to Poland. But we must remember that the missing quarter of a billion is more than many high street retail chains earn in a full year. And Tesco is a relatively uncomplicated enterprise – one that is able to add up the cash passing through its tills every day. It seems astonishing that the leading accountancy firm PwC, which has audited Tesco’s accounts for more than three decades, could have allowed an error on this scale to happen on its watch. Indeed, the choice of a top ‘magic circle’ law firm Freshfields, along with new accountants Deloitte, to conduct a probe into the affair suggests that it goes deeper than a simple accounting mistake. So what on earth has gone on? It was amid a slumping share price – and management chaos – that Tesco’s latest chief executive Dave Lewis arrived at the company from consumer goods giant Unilever on September 1. He discovered that the previous team, reporting to the office of Ferrari-driving Phil Clarke, was under enormous pressure from investors to buff up the company’s performance – and preserve their jobs and bonuses. To this end, they allegedly manipulated the published figures by counting profits before they had been rung up at the tills. At the same time, they allegedly under-reported the costs of goods from suppliers. This is the kind of shoddy practice one might expect from struggling businesses way down the corporate pecking order. That it should come at one of Britain’s most respected FTSE 100 companies is astounding. Already, four top-level executives – including UK managing director Chris Bush – have been suspended. And before you think this is merely a problem for a very large and rich company, consider that everyone in the country with a company pension fund, or an insurance policy, or a share ISA, is a loser because some of their money will automatically be invested in Tesco. The group’s shares are now down 40 per cent this year, with £2billion wiped off in latest trading. Tesco has long represented a mass of contradictions. It has been a smart innovator, moving back into small neighbourhood stores before its competitors, exploiting online shopping, and moving into new areas such as banking, and even upmarket coffee shops. But at the same time it is reviled by suppliers who accuse it of bullying practices and slow payment of invoices. It’s also hated by the green lobby for ‘concreting’ over swathes of Britain, and accused of hoarding valuable land and property suitable for housing. The first indications of fundamental problems came in January 2012. Mr Clarke, less than a year into the role of chief executive, warned profits would fail to meet expectations for the first time in 19 years. In April of the same year he announced a £1billion revival plan directed at improving the stores that were described by some consumers as cold, industrial and unappealing in appearance, and offering poor customer service. But Tesco was also a victim of cultural change sweeping through high streets, shopping centres and malls. As a mid-market retailer, it found itself caught in a vice between the no-frills retailers at the discount end of the market, and the rising strength of Marks & Spencer and Waitrose among the more aspirational shoppers. At the same time, the company’s huge investment in out-of-town Tesco Extra superstores was undermined by the digital revolution which ushered in Amazon and price comparison websites. Tesco also found itself in retreat in America, China and Eastern Europe. These were challenges enough without a £250million gap in profits, which will mean many people will find it hard to trust the group for some time. By holding its own inquiry, the Tesco board – headed by former HMRC chief Richard Broadbent – will hope to keep official investigators at bay and deal with any issues internally. That may be very difficult given the importance of the company and the threat to the reputation of British business. And, while the public will continue to shop in its stores, long-suffering suppliers, investors and regulators may be much less forgiving. Tesco said today that the overstatement of its half-year profits by £250million was 'principally due to the accelerated recognition of commercial income and delayed accrual of costs'. This could mean that the reporting of any costs Tesco incurred during the first half of the financial year was been pushed back into the second half, and profits from the second put forward. In regard to supermarkets, commercial income can be the revenue the chain receives from the companies which supply its products, who compete for the prime spots on the supermarket's shelves. Some of these firms will pay Tesco a listing fee in order for their products to be stocked in stores. They will also shell out in order to bag a prime shelf location or for any promotions or product discounts involving their goods, which often lead to increased sales for the supplier. The supplier may offer a discount on items sold through the supermarket, and although some brands may give an incentive or payment, known as a rebate, to the store upfront, others would only do so if it reaches a sales target. Halfway through the financial year, supermarkets must predict how much they expect rebates will be worth over the course of the year, but this estimation requires some guess work by managers over money yet to be received. Warwick Business School’s Crawford Spence said the revelation should be interpreted as a 'sign of distress'. 'Tesco has essentially tried to recognise revenue too early and delay the recording of costs until a later date,' he said. 'Accounting is not a hard science and some of this behaviour is acceptable, within limits. What Tesco appear to have done is push the boat out a bit too far, ending up with revenue that hadn't really been earned yet and costs that probably should have been booked earlier.'","Supermarket giant has admitted inflating its finance accounts by £250million .

It’s not about an entitlement to just go and be an MP because Dad was too. I’m not saying they should never run for office. I’m saying that they should go and have a real life first.’ Will Straw, son of former Home Secretary Jack, has been selected to contest Rossendale and Darwen in Lancashire, while Stephen Kinnock, son of former Labour leader Neil, will stand in the safe seat of Aberavon in South Wales.

"By . James Chapman . Shake-up: Harriet Harman said allowing Scottish MPs to vote on laws that only affect England is an ‘anomaly’ that must be addressed . Ed Miliband faced open revolt over English home rule last night after Labour’s deputy leader called for the issue to be tackled. Harriet Harman said allowing Scottish MPs to vote on laws that only affect England is an ‘anomaly’ that must be addressed. After days of the Labour leadership refusing to back the idea, she told LBC Radio: ‘We do have to recognise there’s an anomaly and look at different ways we can address that.’ With senior MPs joining forces to create a new group called the English Labour Party, there were also warnings that Mr Miliband is not speaking ‘clearly or loudly enough’ about strengthening the influence of English MPs. Former Cabinet minister Ben Bradshaw, who yesterday attended the inaugural meeting of the new group, said Labour must be ‘clear we are fighting for England’. And Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk warned that Mr Miliband will have a ‘real problem’ in his party conference speech today unless he addresses the issue of Scottish MPs being allowed to continue voting on laws that only apply in England. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls yesterday became the latest senior figure to reject David Cameron’s plans to introduce ‘English votes for English laws’. He refused a total of six times to agree that it was ‘unfair’ for Scottish MPs to vote on English issues in Parliament as the fallout continued from last week’s No vote in the independence referendum and the promise of new powers for Holyrood. Mr Miliband himself dodged the question 13 times when asked whether England should get the same rights promised to Scotland in a TV interview on Sunday. There is now increasing alarm in Labour ranks that the party leadership appears to have no answer to Mr Cameron’s plans. Labour is reluctant to see any dilution of the rights of its 40 Scottish MPs at Westminster – fearing it would be unable to pass laws on key areas such as health, education and tax if it wins the next election. Tony Blair only succeeded in passing legislation on foundation hospitals and tuition fees thanks to MPs with seats north of the border – even though their constituents are unaffected by them. The Conservatives say the situation will become untenable once further powers over tax, welfare and spending are devolved to the Scottish Parliament. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls (left) yesterday became the latest senior figure to reject David Cameron’s plans to introduce ‘English votes for English laws’. Mr Miliband (cente) himself dodged the question 13 times when asked whether England should get the same rights promised to Scotland in a TV interview . Former Culture Secretary Mr Bradshaw told the Western Morning News: ‘Our leadership has to be much clearer that there’s a problem that needs addressing. But I haven’t heard clearly or loudly enough from the leadership that there is a problem that needs addressing.’ Although the Exeter MP said the Tory plan was a ‘stitch-up in Westminster’, he claimed there was an ‘imbalance and unfairness in our constitutional settlement’. Mr Bradshaw later told the BBC there should be an immediate constitutional convention. ‘Let’s get on with it,’ he added. Yesterday's Daily Mail . ‘This is a historic moment Labour must not miss.’ Mr Danczuk said he was ‘surprised’ and ‘disappointed’ that Mr Miliband did not have a set of proposals on English home rule following last week’s independence referendum result. ‘If he doesn’t address it tomorrow then he’s got a real problem... then we are really on the back foot,’ he said. Mr Balls told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Mr Balls insisted the Prime Minister was ‘playing fast and loose with the whole of our Union’. ‘I want fairness, but I’m not going to say there’s an easy and fair solution to the question you’re raising,’ he added. Len McCluskey, general-secretary of the union Unite, told the Labour conference in Manchester: ‘We don’t want a constitution made by posh boys in Chequers.’ Shadow Welsh Secretary Owen Smith also rejected the plan, calling it a ‘tawdry trick’ to buy off critics.","Deputy leader  says Scots MPs voting on English laws is an 'anomaly'

"By . Julian Robinson for MailOnline . A woman tried to kill her mother by poisoning her Diet Coke in a plot inspired by Breaking Bad, a court heard. Kuntal Patel, 37, allegedly bought a Ricin-style poison online to murder her ‘violent’ mother, who would not allow her to marry her boyfriend. But 60-year-old Meena Patel, a magistrate, survived. Patel, a graphic designer, was arrested in January after the FBI traced the shipment to the family’s home in Plaistow, East London. She admitted buying Abrin, which has no antidote, from the illicit ‘dark web’. Kuntal Patel (right) allegedly slipped her mother Meena (left) the deadly poison after she 'forbade' her to marry her boyfriend, a court heard . Prosecutor Jonathan Polnay told Southwark Crown Court that ‘the Patels must have seemed a highly respectable and happy family’. But Meena really controlled ‘every aspect’ of her daughters’ lives. When Kuntal met Niraj Kakad on Shaadi.com, a dating service for the Asian community, she was furious. Mr Polnay said: ‘When Meena forbade Kuntal from marrying Niraj . . . Kuntal set out in a  calculated and premeditated fashion to murder her own mother. Inspired, in part, by US television series Breaking Bad, she acquired a deadly toxin called Abrin, a close  relation to Ricin. She acquired it over the “dark web”. ‘[It] arrived from the United States concealed in a wax  candle. Kuntal secretly poured the Abrin into her mother’s Diet Coke and watched her drink it – expecting her to die. But nothing happened.’ The poison is 1,000 times less toxic if swallowed, not inhaled or injected. Undeterred, Patel allegedly set about getting hold of a stronger sample. The court heard Meena Patel locked Kuntal up and beat her. In messages, she called her a ‘witch’ and ‘f*****-up brain girl who cannot be my blood’ for loving Mr Kakad, who lived in America and proposed to Kuntal in November 2012. In an email, Kuntal branded Meena ‘evil’, adding: ‘I told her how much I liked him and she started slapping me.’ Meena allegedly called Mr Kakad a ‘black ugly b******’. Kuntal Patel (shown in a court drawing) denies trying to murder her mother and acquiring a biological agent or toxin . Kuntal wrote: ‘I’ll never  forgive her . . . I would prefer to be dead. I’m stuck with that miserable f***** until she dies.’ Meena hacked her daughter’s phone and seized her credit cards, Mr Polnay said. He added: ‘Meena’s attitude was “over my dead body”. ‘It was at this time, we say, that Kuntal Patel made the decision that the best way to ensure that she got what she wanted – happiness for herself – was by killing her mother.’ He told jurors: ‘In private, Meena Patel – the magistrate who worked in domestic  violence and race relations – was not a nice woman at all.’ Bad guys: Aaron Paul and Bryan Cranston in the TV show . She used ‘highly racist’ terms and could be violent, he said, adding: ‘Meena Patel was all of those things – manipulative, controlling and selfish. But she did not deserve to die.’ After she was charged, Kuntal allegedly confessed to Meena  in a phone call from prison, saying: ‘I was going to kill  you and Amba Ma [a Hindu Goddess] saw it, that’s why she has punished me . . . I did put that in your Coke.’ US series Breaking Bad stars Bryan Cranston as chemistry teacher Walter White, who cooks crystal meth to fund his cancer treatment. He kills a character using Ricin. Patel called the man who sold her the poison ‘Heisenberg’ – White’s alias. Patel denies attempted murder and acquiring a biological agent or toxin. She admits two counts of attempting to acquire a biological agent or toxin.

"By . Louise Eccles for the Daily Mail . Britons live in the smallest homes in Western Europe because of draconian planning laws restricting house building, a report found yesterday. Residential floor space in Britain is on average just 66 square metres (710 square feet) per household, compared to a spacious 118 square metres (1,270 sq ft) in Ireland, 115 square metres (1,238 sq ft) in Denmark or 110 square metres (1,184 sq ft) in Italy, according to data compiled by the Institute of Economic Affairs. The UK languished at the bottom of the think-tank’s list, below Greece and Luxembourg – which still had significantly more space with 78 and 84 square metres (840 and 904 square feet) respectively. Scroll down for video . Residential floor space in Britain is on average just 66 square metres (710 square feet) per household - pictured is a former council flat in Bethnal Green, London . Ryan Bourne, the IEA’s head of public policy, said: ‘Some believe the UK doesn’t have a housing shortage because many households have “spare rooms”. But rooms in the UK tend to be much smaller than in other countries. ‘All the evidence suggests that years of tight planning controls restricting house building has led to us having the smallest space per household in Western Europe.’ The figures were compiled as part of a report which confronted some of the most widely-held views about the cost of living crisis. The IEA contests the claim that Britain has enough houses but too many people live in particular areas and should move to less populated parts of the country. Instead, it said, house building simply has not kept up with the growing population. Britons live in the smallest homes in Western Europe, a report has revealed - pictured are six houses in Llanhilleth, south Wales that were sold for just £100 in 2009 . The number of people in the UK has risen by five million over the past 12 years and is growing faster than anywhere else in Europe. Last year, the number of people in the UK rose by more than 400,000 to pass 64million for the first time, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics. The IEA report said: ‘Throughout more than three decades, the UK has been building fewer new homes than any other country in Europe. ‘As a result, residential floor space per household is now the lowest in Western Europe. This shows that the housing problem cannot be solved through redistribution… for the simple reason that there is not a lot to redistribute. The housing stock is inadequate in total. There is no “excess housing” in any region, only different degrees of shortfall.’ The report also claimed that areas which were in the most desperate need for new homes, including Greater London, Oxford, Cambridge, Bristol and Bath, had a ‘disproportionate share of greenbelt land and have particularly virulent anti-development campaigners’. It added: ‘Paradoxically, the regions where demand is lowest account for a disproportionate share of the construction activity.’ The report came as a separate study by the ONS revealed that the number of houses built in the UK fell from 378,000 in the financial year 1969/70 to just 141,000 in 2013/14. The price of flats has risen at double the rate of detached homes since 2009, a study found. Owners of apartments have seen the value of their property jump by 43 per cent over five years – against just 20 per cent for a detached house. Terraced properties had the second biggest rise at 31 per cent, while bungalows rose 15 per cent. Halifax, which commissioned the report, said the upturn in first-time buyers – who tend to buy flats and terraced houses – had driven up prices for smaller properties, particularly in London. It found that by April to June this year, the average value of flats had risen by around £62,000 compared with the same period in 2009. Meanwhile, detached homes rose by £52,000 and semi-detached houses increased by just £33,000. According to the report, the average flat is now more expensive than a semi-detached home, costing £208,169 compared to £197,571. The average detached costs £318,264. Martin Ellis, housing economist at Halifax, said: ‘There has been a significant increase in first-time buyers since 2010 compared with a modest decline in the number of those moving home. ‘This difference is reflected in a bigger rise in prices over the past five years for those property types that are most popular with first-time buyers – flats and terraces.’ First-time buyers accounted for almost a third of flat sales over the last decade, compared to just five per cent of sales for detached homes.","Residential floor space in Britain is on average just 66 square metres .

"By . Damien Gayle for MailOnline . Passion killer: Mr Justice Mostyn, a High Court's family division judge, advised divorcing women not to begin new romances until proceedings are over . Women fighting their ex-husbands for divorce settlements should shy away from new romances, says a High Court judge. Mr Justice Mostyn said the start of a new relationship can be a 'significant fly in the ointment' to judges in the family court deciding how much money ex-wives should be awarded. Women risk losing their share of their ex-husbands assets because judges might assume their financial future was assured through setting up home with their new partners, he said. Mr Justice Mostyn made his comments in a written ruling on a family court case in Swansea, the Telegraph reported. The couple, both in their 40s, had lived together with an adopted child. The mother worked hard as a journalist, while the father had no income, but had inherited millions from his family. Their marriage turned sour in September 2012, and the couple began lengthy legal wrangles over how to share their assets. As these disputes continued, the wife started a relationship with a former army officer. She didn't come clean about her romance, but investigations by her husband's legal team revealed it to the court. It seriously hurt her case, with Mr Justice Mostyn reasoning: 'She says she is not going to live with him, although it is perfectly clear that the relationship is strong. 'Relationships like this always are a significant fly in the ointment in the assessment of need. 'One cannot make assumptions, if it is not full-blown cohabitation akin to marriage, that it will grow into that, because if it does not, the wife may be left stranded between Scylla and Charybdis if the assumption is wrongly made. 'On the other hand, if one makes a needs assessment on the basis that she is a single woman and she soon cohabits, then the paying party ... can rightfully feel significantly aggrieved.' Divorce: Mr Justice Mostyn made his comments in a written ruling on a family court case in Swansea . Taking into account the relationship, Mr Justice Mostyn decided that around £250,000 would be enough to meet her needs - less than if she had remained single. 'If the wife were assuredly single and I could foresee that continuing, I would have my doubts as to whether a net capital position ... of just over £250,000 would be enough,' he said. 'On the other hand, I cannot ignore the existence of the relationship ... and so I reach the conclusion that the net figure that I leave the wife with of just over £250,000 is sufficient to meet her needs.' Family lawyer Louise Halford, of Irwin Mitchell LLP, told the Telegraph she thought the judge's conclusion was 'a bit of a reach'. 'I’m not quite sure how this judge is so sure that their relationship isn’t some sort of flash in the pan', she said.","Mr Justice Mostyn made his comments in a written ruling on a divorce case .

It is thought he had heard intruders in his garden before he was fatally wounded and found on the street by terrified members of the public. Thomas Lamb, 46, was brutally attacked at his home in Restalrig Circus in Edinburgh after 'a row at a pub' Mr Lamb, who was known as Tam, had been at the Tor pub in Restalrig on Friday evening where he was a regular pool player. Police believe he may have been involved in an argument before leaving the bar. He was rushed to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary but later pronounced dead. DCI Keith Hardie said: ‘It was a brutal, sustained and a pretty horrific attack involving significant levels of violence. ‘A couple of neighbours had obviously heard a disturbance and seen parts of an assault. One of them had gone out to the street and found him lying on the street. ‘We did recover a pitchfork from the scene and we’ll get that forensically examined. ‘Whether or not that’s involved in the attack on this individual is too early to say.’ Restalrig Circus in Edinburgh where Thomas Lamb is believed to have been stabbed with a pitchfork . It is thought he heard intruders in his garden before being found on the street by terrified members of the public . The gruesome attack is the second tragedy to hit the family after Mr Lamb’s daughter Donna, 17, died suddenly in her sleep two years ago. DCI Hardie added: ‘We are in touch with his family and will build up a picture of this individual. As you can imagine they [the family] are obviously traumatised because of the death of their son. ‘We will let them deal with their grief, but we will get some antecedent history around our victim and what type of individual he was.’ The gruesome attack is the second tragedy to hit the family after Mr Lamb’s daughter Donna, 17, died suddenly in her sleep two years ago. Police are now hunting for three men that were seen in the area at around 1am and have urged anyone with information to contact them. DCI Hardie said: 'I am satisfied, at this stage, that there has been a form of incident in the Tor public house very shortly prior to us finding a victim dead in the street - probably about 150 yards from the Tor pub. I am entirely satisfied there is a link there. The Tor pub where Mr Lamb was a regular pool player and had been on Friday evening before the brutal attack . 'It was particularly busy on the Friday night. We know our victim plays pool on a regular basis and he was in the pool room prior to him leaving the public house. 'I understand he was a local in the public house and a fairly quiet individual. He kept himself to himself. 'There is so much speculation that goes on and always does in this type of enquiry. Whether drug dealing was involved? It would be too early to say.'

'We are keen to trace three men who were seen in the area at the time. It would appear they would have probably been in his company during the evening. 'We are appealing to witnesses from the time itself. Obviously, one o’clock in the morning is a crucial time for us when we know our victim left the pub.

The mother of two, who is married to field archaeologist David Stevens, said: ‘From a very young age, parents are pushing their boys to achieve in a way they don’t always do for girls. Professor Alice Roberts has banned her daughter from having a princess party because she doesn't want her to become obsessed by 'girly' stereotypes . ‘I’m sure it’s an unconscious bias – even if we think we’re not treating boys and girls differently, very often actually we are. ‘I don’t think anyone is saying that we should be treating boys and girls exactly the same and that we should try to eliminate all differences. What the psychologists who do this work are saying is we should be aware of it and careful about it, especially if we think it could be limiting choices. ‘It’s all about making sure you’re not constraining them by treating them in a stereotyped way – you’re not bringing them up to think they have a defined set of choices in society.’ Asked what rules she imposes in her house to tackle the problem, Professor Roberts told the Radio Times: ‘I’m really aware of the “pinkification” of toys and clothes. The mother-of-two said she has become really aware of the 'pinkification' of toys and clothes . She said: ‘I’m sure it’s an unconscious bias – even if we think we’re not treating boys and girls differently, very often actually we are' ‘As parents we have to tread these lines very carefully. You don’t want them to feel as if they are not fitting in with their peers, because that’s very important to them. ‘One way I try to manage it is by not having a princess party for my daughter and trying to do things that are not so stereotyped. But if she’s invited to a princess party, of course I’m not going to stop her going.’ After leaving a medical career in 1998, Professor Roberts taught anatomy at Bristol University. She has presented TV shows including Time Team and Coast, and two years ago she was appointed as the University of Birmingham’s first Professor of Public Engagement in Science. She said: ‘The important thing is when you look at areas like physics and you realise that only one in five A-level students is a girl. We know it isn’t about aptitude. ‘It’s not viewed as a feminine subject or one suitable for females. It’s a real shame because it means children’s horizons are being limited.’ Next week, Professor Roberts will feature in a BBC Horizon special alongside Dr Michael Mosley, in which the pair will discuss the debate surrounding nature versus nurture.","Professor Alice Roberts banned her daughter from having a princess party .

"By . Laura Clark, Education Correspondent For The Daily Mail . Lura Pacheco, 34, (pictured) forged a tenancy agreement in an attempt to get her 11-year-old daughter into a good secondary school in Havering . A mother who cheated to get her daughter into a good school has been fined £500 and sentenced to community service in a ground-breaking case. Lura Pacheco, 34, forged a tenancy agreement in an attempt to persuade high-performing schools she lived closer than she really did. But the mother-of-two, who works for an international recruitment company, was caught out when the property’s real owner received an offer and charged with forgery. Havering Council, which brought the prosecution, said the case was the first of its kind and others could follow. It was brought against a backdrop of rising numbers of suspicious school applications that are prompting investigations by councils across the country. Latest figures suggest that council probes into potentially fraudulent applications have soared 11-fold in five years. Five years ago Mrinal Patel became the first parent to be prosecuted for allegedly lying over school places but the charges were later dropped after running into legal problems. In the latest case, Pacheco, a Portuguese national, had been desperate to get her 11-year-old daughter into a secondary school in the London borough of Havering because she believed they had a better reputation than comprehensives nearer her home in Chadwell Heath, Barking and Dagenham. Magistrates heard how a friend of Pacheco offered to produce a forged tenancy agreement for a home in Hornchurch, within Havering borough, using the fake firm Easy Property Services. The move could have secured a place for her daughter at either Brittons Academy, Chafford School, Frances Bardsley School for Girls, Sacred Heart of Mary Girls School or Bower Park Academy. But town hall investigators uncovered the forgery when the offer of a place was sent to the property’s real owner, who alerted the local authority. After admitting one forgery offence - committed on December 13 last year – Pacheco was ordered to pay £500 and sentenced to 100 hours’ community service. Sentencing at Barkingside magistrates’ court, presiding magistrate Michael Peacock said: ‘You are obviously a very good and conscientious mother and like all good mothers you want your kid to go to the best school available. ‘I think the public are very aware of the lengths people go to to try and secure that. We hear of people buying expensive houses in expensive streets and so on in order to get into a certain catchment area. But whatever you do it’s got to be within the law. ‘What you did was dishonest. It was cheating, cheating the system. It was unfair to people who would have wanted that place if you had succeeded.’ Pacheco was ordered to pay £500 and given 100 hours’ community service at Barkingside magistrates' court (pictured) after admitting forgery. Presiding magistrate Michael Peacock said she had 'cheated the system' Speaking after the hearing, Pacheco told the London Evening Standard: ‘Mums just want the best for their children, they want the best education for them possible. I am still shaken by this experience.’ Giles Morrison, representing Havering council, said: ‘She wanted her daughter to get into a Havering school as these are generally better and she was aware that at this time her address was covered by Barking and Dagenham. ‘It [the offence] is, I am told, something Havering council is very concerned with in the borough and there might be a number of other prosecutions that might happen in the future. But this is thought to be the first of its kind.’ Damian White, deputy leader of Havering council, said: ‘Creating false documents, no matter what the reason, is fraud and ultimately takes away places from those that were entitled to them.’ The case follows suggestions that councils are toughening up on parents who try to cheat the system to secure their chosen schools. Tactics include using false addresses lying about siblings and even impersonating family members. But councils are becoming increasingly alert to possible ruses and demanding more rigorous proofs of residence. Sanctions include withdrawing places refusing applications in or in extreme cases, prosecution. In 2009, Harrow Council accused 41-year-old Mrinal Patel of giving her mother’s address when applying to the over-subscribed Pinner Park First School. She faced up to a year in jail or a £5,000 fine after the council used the Fraud Act 2006 to prosecute her over the school application for her five-year-old son Rhys. Mrs Patel appeared at Harrow Magistrates’ Court in May 2009 and denied fraud by false representation. But two months later the council withdrew its action after being advised that the Act may not apply to her case and could be open to challenge. At the time, Mrs Patel told the BBC that Harrow’s decision not to launch the ‘disproportionate’ action against her showed she was innocent. In 2009, Harrow Council accused 41-year-old Mrinal Patel (pictured) of giving her mother’s address when applying to the over-subscribed Pinner Park First School. She claimed she had lived at the address for 14 years . But she admitted she had said on the application form that she had lived at the address for 14 years, when in fact she had stayed there for only four weeks. The mother-of-three claimed she wrote this figure because her mother had been living at the address for 14 years. She had been ‘under a tremendous amount of stress’ at the time. Her mother’s home was walking distance from the school that was rated ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted and received more than 400 applications for 90 places. However, council action has sometimes crossed into over-zealousness. In 2008, Poole Borough Council mounted an extraordinary covert surveillance operation targeting businesswoman Jenny Paton, her partner Tim Joyce and their three children. The family were followed for three weeks by council officials who wrongly suspected the family of lying to get into a good school. The investigators filled out detailed surveillance forms, describing the family's car as a 'target vehicle'. Using powers available under anti-terror laws, the council surveillance team made detailed notes of the family's whereabouts on 21 occasions. But the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, which heard a complaint from the family in 2010, concluded the council's operation was an improper, unnecessary and unlawful use of the surveillance powers.","Lura Pacheco, 34, forged tenancy agreement in attempt to win school place .

"By . Sam Webb for MailOnline . An Algerian group linked to Islamic State jihadists threatened to kill a French hostage within 24 hours unless Paris halts air strikes on the IS in Iraq, in a video posted Monday. Jund al-Khilifa (Soldiers of the Caliphate), which has pledged allegiance to IS, said in the video that it carried out Sunday's kidnapping of the Frenchman in a mountainous region of eastern Algeria where Al-Qaeda is active. The hostage, Herve Pierre Gourdel, 55, white-haired and bespectacled, is shown squatting on the ground flanked by two hooded men clutching Kalashnikov assault rifles, as he asks for French President Francois Hollande to intervene. Scroll down for video . Terror: French tourist, Herve Pierre Gourdel sitting between two armed jihadists at an undisclosed location. An Algerian militant group said it has kidnapped a Frenchman and threatened to execute him unless Paris halts air strikes on Islamic State jihadists in Iraq . 'It is up to Hollande, president of the criminal French state, to halt the attacks on the Islamic State within 24 hours of this statement, otherwise his national Herve Gourdel will have his throat slit,' one of his kidnappers says in the video. Gourdel says he is a native of Nice in southern France who works as a mountain guide, and that he only arrived in Algeria on Saturday. He was seized while hiking with Algerian friends. In the video, the kidnappers say they are responding to a call from IS, posted just hours earlier, for Muslims to kill citizens of countries taking part in the U.S.-led coalition against the jihadists who have seized of large swathes of Iraq and Syria. Waiting: Journalists  in Nice, southeastern France, in front the house called 'Villa Marie Joseph', where French hostage Herve Pierre Gourde reportedly lives . 'If you can kill a disbelieving American or European - especially the spiteful and filthy French - or an Australian, or a Canadian or any other disbeliever... including the citizens of the countries that entered into a coalition against the Islamic State, then rely upon Allah, and kill him,' said IS spokesman Abu Mohammed al-Adnani. 'Kill the disbeliever whether he is civilian or military,' he said in the message, which was released in multiple languages. France mounted its first air strike to beat back the IS in Iraq on Friday, joining an aerial assault which the United States launched on August 8. 'I am in the hands of Jund al-Khilifa, an Algerian armed group,' 'This armed group is asking me to ask you (President Hollande) to not intervene in Iraq. 'They are holding me as a hostage and I ask you Mr President to do everything to get me out of this bad situation and I thank you.' The French foreign ministry confirmed a national had been kidnapped during a visit to the Tizi Ouzou region. Tizi Ouzou is in Kabylie, where Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, or AQIM, has carried out deadly attacks this year. 'Everything is being done to find our fellow countryman. Authorities are mobilised and no hypothesis is being discarded,' the ministry said. Earlier, France said it was not spooked by the IS call for Muslims to kill citizens of countries fighting the jihadists. 'France is not afraid,' Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said repeatedly during a televised statement. But, at the same time, the French foreign ministry urged nationals living in or travelling to some 30 countries in Africa and the Middle East to exercise 'utmost caution'. Since December 2005, almost 80 Algerians have been kidnapped in Kabylie, with the kidnappers demanding ransoms. Three of the hostages have been killed. On Monday, the Algerian army said it killed a 'terrorist chief' the previous night in Kabylie, using Algeria's term for armed Islamists.","Herve Pierre Gourdel, 55, kidnapped while hiking with Algerian friends .

"By . Mark Duell for MailOnline . On trial: Rachael Thompson, of Plymouth, allegedly drew the blade across both heels of the boy . A 40-year-old mother deliberately cut the feet of her baby son with a razor, a court heard today. Rachael Thompson allegedly drew the blade across both heels of the four-month-old boy - but claimed he had accidentally cut his feet on the razor after it had fallen into a bath. However, medical experts said the injuries must have been caused deliberately, Plymouth Crown Court in Devon was told. One nurse at Derriford Hospital in the city said the injuries were ‘horrific’. An expert who tried to reconstruct an accident using a wooden model of a baby’s leg covered in pig skin could not replicate the wounds. Thompson denies a charge of child cruelty which is alleged to have happened in September 2011. Jo Martin, prosecuting, said Thompson took her son to her local A&E department on the evening of September 17. She said the child was found to have two identical wounds on each heel. Thompson, of Plymouth, told staff that she had been bathing the baby in the family bath two days earlier when she turned her back for a few seconds after her partner called to her. Miss Martin said the mother then said she heard a cry from her son and saw blood in the water. She told the jury: ‘She discovered a razor and its stand had been in the bath. She picked her son up and saw both his heels were bleeding. She assumed he had somehow cut them on the razor.’ Hearing: Plymouth Crown Court (pictured) was told Thompson denies a charge of child cruelty from 2011 . The court heard the nurse and doctors were suspicious about her account and contacted police and social services. The boy was admitted overnight but his injuries were ‘superficial’. In police interview, Thompson said ‘she would not hurt her child’. A&E nurse Emma Congdon said she was suspicious because of the two-day delay in bringing in the baby. She said the mother told her the baby had ‘kicked’ the razor into the bath. She said the wounds were ‘horrific’, adding: ‘You would not leave a four month old baby on its own in the bath.’ The trial continues.

"By . Julian Robinson for MailOnline . A property trader masterminded a £3m mortgage fraud with the help of his benefits-claiming mother and sales assistant girlfriend, the Old Bailey heard today. Wayne Stubbs, 44, Wendy Stubbs, 61, and Rachel Gledhill, 39,  overstated their incomes in applications for luxury properties in London’s Notting Hill, Kent and Huddersfield, it is claimed. In one case Wendy Stubbs claimed to be earning £120,000 a year as a financial consultant when in reality she was unemployed and receiving state benefits, jurors were told. Wayne Stubbs (right), Wendy Stubbs and Rachel Gledhill (left) overstated their incomes in applications for luxury properties in London’s Notting Hill, Kent and Huddersfield, it is claimed . Wayne Stubbs claimed to be a high-earning ‘unit trust dealer’ but appears not to have paid any tax or National Insurance since 1995, the court heard. Gledhill also allegedly stated she was earning more than £67,000 a year as a self-employed IT consultant when she was really getting £38,000 a year as a sales assistant for Harvey Nicholls. Prosecutor Nicholas Mather told the Old Bailey: ‘The prosecution is that these three defendants individually and in some cases together obtained a number of different mortgages by lying as part of the mortgage applications process about their employment. ‘They then bought properties on the back of those lies and received a steady income by renting out these properties to paying tenants, income which was never declared and which amounts to the proceeds of criminal conduct.’ Mr Mather said that Wayne Stubbs was ‘behind each and every one of the transactions’. In one case Wendy Stubbs (pictured) claimed to be earning £120,000 a year as a financial consultant when in reality she was unemployed and receiving state benefits, jurors were told . ‘It is no coincidence that the others in the dock are his mother and partner - his fingerprints are all over everything in this case. ‘Wendy went along with this but knew what was taking place was dishonest. The same goes for Rachel Gledhill. ‘The sizes of mortgages they were acquiring, they must have known applications were being made in their name with false details.’ It is claimed Wayne and Wendy Stubbs were involved in applying for a £300,000 mortgage on a property in Orpington, Kent in 2002, and a £237,500 mortgage on a flat in Notting Hill, in 2003. Wayne Stubbs and Rachel Gledhill then applied for a £225,000 mortgage on a property in Quarmby, Huddersfield, in 2004. Stubbs then applied for a £237,500 mortgage for a flat in Bromley. Next Gledhill applied for a £434,950 mortgage from a property in Keston, Kent. In 2006 Wayne and Wendy Stubbs applied for a £1.2m mortgage on a property in Chislehurst, Kent and in 2008 Wayne Stubbs falsely stated the source of a £230,000 deposit a different flat in Notting Hill. Wendy and Wayne Stubbs, both of Chislehurst, Kent, deny four counts of obtaining a money transfer by deception for which they are jointly charged. Wayne Stubbs further denies three counts of entering or becoming concerned with a money laundering arrangement, and a count each of obtaining a money transfer by deception, acquiring criminal property, and fraud by false representation. Wendy Stubbs denies entering or becoming concerned with a money laundering arrangement and two counts of acquiring criminal property.

"By . Mark Duell for MailOnline . Britain’s only female giant panda is no longer pregnant, Edinburgh Zoo announced today. The zoo said there is no evidence Tian Tian has had a miscarriage, and that ‘late reabsorption of the foetus’ could have taken place. It said that all data gathered since the animal conceived in April suggested she was pregnant and likely carry to full term, but ‘sadly this did not happen’. Scroll down for video . UK's only female giant panda: Edinburgh Zoo said there is no evidence Tian Tian has had a miscarriage . The zoo said the panda is in great health, and is being monitored by experts. Tian Tian was artificially inseminated on April 13 after she and her intended partner Yang Guang failed to mate naturally. The zoo announced in August that she was thought to be pregnant and could give birth by the end of the month, however hopes of a cub faded when she passed her due date. Hormone tests suggested that something might be amiss, though at the start of September the zoo said there was still a chance she could give birth to a live cub. However, in a statement today the zoo confirmed that would not happen. Iain Valentine, director of giant pandas for the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, said: ‘Tian Tian's hormone levels have now returned to normal, so we can confirm that she is no longer pregnant. ‘Panda reproduction and biology is . complex; all data gathered since conception took place pointed to a . pregnant panda likely to carry to full term, sadly this did not happen. There is no evidence she has had a miscarriage, so late reabsorption of the foetus could have occurred. Tian Tian: The zoo said that 'late reabsorption of the foetus' could have taken place in this case . ‘Although . Tian Tian has not successfully given birth, it is important for her . individual biology as a female giant panda and for the future of giant . panda conservation across the globe that we tried. We will also be . reviewing all our data and procedures from this year and last. 'Although Tian Tian has not successfully given birth, it is important for her individual biology as a female giant panda and for the future of giant panda conservation across the globe that we tried' Iain Valentine, Royal Zoological Society of Scotland . ‘The team continue to monitor Tian Tian and she is in great health. The specialist team here and international colleagues will thoroughly review every aspect of how we care for her.’ Tian Tian (Sweetie) and Yang Guang (Sunshine) are the first giant pandas to live in the UK for 17 years. The animals, both aged ten, arrived on loan from China in December 2011 and will remain at Edinburgh Zoo for a decade. Tian . Tian was successfully inseminated last year but lost her cub at late . term. The attempt was the first artificial insemination procedure to . take place on a giant panda in the UK. She was again inseminated in April and the zoo confirmed in July that she had conceived but was not yet technically pregnant. Expectations: The zoo announced in August that she was thought to be pregnant and could give birth by the end of the month, however hopes of a cub faded when she passed her due date . Experts . said it would not be known for certain if she was pregnant until she . gave birth. The zoo said that the outdoor viewing area of Tian Tian and . Yang Guang's enclosures will be open from today. Asked whether the zoo will try again next . year Mr Valentine said: ‘Yes we will, first we need to make sure that . Tian Tian and Yang Guang are in great condition, Tian Tian still needs . to get back into a routine which will take a few months and then from . about the shortest day we will start to monitor her again for breeding. 'The specialist team here and international colleagues will thoroughly review every aspect of how we care for her' Mr Valentine . ‘So it's only around three months until we start monitoring, and another three months until we're back into the breeding season, there's still lots of work to do but hopefully next year it will all come together. ‘There's a lot of new science we've brought to panda breeding and we've learnt a huge amount from the last two years and every time we go through this we learn more and take another step forward. ‘It will take time and absolutely it's devastating for everyone involved, it's nine months of work for a huge group, people are tired, exhausted and disappointed but we carry on.' He added: ‘It's similar to last year only in the fact that she's lost the pregnancy. ‘What we can say is that the data from this year looks so much better in terms of timing and things to happen and it was absolutely right for two and a half weeks, whereas last year it was bouncing around a bit more frequently. The data looks quite different from last year but the result is exactly the same.’ Two panda cubs born in America last year .","Edinburgh Zoo says there's no evidence Tian Tian has had miscarriage .

"By . Ollie Gillman for MailOnline . The wife of a retired banker who lived a luxury lifestyle off the proceeds of £10million land investment scam has been spared jail. Linda Noad, 58, helped her husband Roger, 60, launder £655,000 which they then used to help their fund their £1million family home in Sevenoaks, Kent, as well as a lavish holiday in Dubai. Roger Noad, who spent 27 years working at Coutts bank, was jailed for three years for allowing the proceeds to be funnelled through his bank accounts over six years. Linda Noad (left), 58, helped her husband Roger (right), 60, launder £655,000 which they then used to help their fund their £1million family home in Sevenoaks, Kent, as well as a lavish holiday in Dubai . The land investment scam on wealthy pensioners and Thalidomide survivors was masterminded by their conman son Matthew, 30, and his associate Clive Griston, 52, who were both jailed for four years and eight months earlier this year. Matthew's parents spent the money on fine wines, jewellery worth £18,000 and a new Mercedes. But Mrs Noad, who suffers from depression and left her job at Sainsbury’s in shame when the story hit the newspapers, was given a two-year suspended sentence at the Old Bailey. Judge Christopher Moss QC told her: ‘I ought to send you straight to prison, however I am prepared to take what may be thought to be a merciful course. ‘You and your husband received that money from your son who was one of the architects of a land bank fraud which stole £10million from elderly investors. ‘You used it to enhance your standard of living including the house in which you presently live. ‘Your family is in effect in tatters and both your son and husband are serving substantial prison sentences. You deserve to do the same. ‘It is clear you are and have been suffering greatly from the convictions of your son and husband, although it could be said you brought this situation on yourself.’ Mrs Noad sighed loudly in relief and looked up to family members in the public gallery as she learned she would not go to prison. The judge told her: ‘You are now free to go.’ Land scam: Matthew Noad (left), 29, and Clive Griston (right), 52, admitted two counts of fraud earlier this year . The Noads now face having their home and other assets confiscated to repay the victims of the fraud. During the series of trials relating to the £10million fraud, jurors were told how Matthew Noad and Clive Griston targeted vulnerable pensioners eager to invest their life savings. The pair used glossy brochures to persuade investors to buy land on the basis they would get high returns if it was developed. Griston laundered £1million of the proceeds through his partner Kerry Golesworthy, 48, who was jailed for three-and-a-half years at an earlier hearing. Golesworthy drove a £109,000 Bentley, bought a £10,000 pearl necklace and a new house in a private estate near Orpington, in Kent, which is now valued at around £2m. At the time she earned less than £9,000 a year as a bookkeeper. Golesworthy and Linda and Roger Noad were all convicted of entering into an arrangement facilitating the use of criminal property relating to the land fraud. Matthew Noad, of Keston, Kent, and Griston were convicted of fraud and jailed in April this year.","Linda Noad helped her husband launder £665,000 from their son's scam .

"By . Julian Robinson for MailOnline . Nelson Herne, 35, of Bedworth, admitted blackmail after the gang he was part of plundered a grieving widow's life savings . A ruthless blackmail gang plundered a grieving widow's £195,000 savings - after hounding her over a non-existent debt. The 80-year-old, from Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, handed over the cash - earmarked for her grandchildren's inheritance - when the men threatened her with bailiffs. But Birmingham Crown Court heard that, in reality, the vulnerable pensioner did not owe them a anything. Five criminals pleaded guilty to their roles in the fraud, including Nelson Herne who was jailed after admitting blackmail. Judge Simon Drew QC told the gang: 'This was the deliberate targeting of an elderly and vulnerable victim. 'She was somebody who was easily preyed upon.' Tom Kenning, prosecuting, said the victim's former husband, who had suffered from Alzheimer's, controlled the finances. In March last year she received a letter from a firm called Midland Recovery Services claiming she owed £12,825. Phone calls followed, threatening her with bailiffs unless she paid up, the court heard. 'She was a very vulnerable lady who did not know whether this debt was true or not,' Mr Kenning said. 'She was effectively targeted.' Mr Kenning said the victim, who lived with her disabled son, handed over thousands of pounds at a time to six people who called at her door. Some of the six had not been charged, the court heard. They went as far as giving her details of bank accounts and sort codes to allow her to make deposits. In a statement, the victim said she had been left feeling vulnerable and threatened and the gang had stolen her grandchildren's inheritance. Nelson Herne, 35, of Bedworth, was jailed for two years after admitting blackmail. Louis Cashin (left) and Christopher Thirlwell (right) both received suspended sentences after pleading guilty to possessing criminal property. The victim said the gang had stolen her grandchildren's inheritance . The court heard he was currently serving a four-and-a-half year sentence for a similar scam. In that case, the victim was defrauded out of £17,000 after being told his home was infested with rats. Four others involved all received suspended sentences after pleading guilty to possessing criminal property. Sean Bell, 27, of Bedworth, Warwickshire was handed a ten-month suspended term, ordered to perform 150 hours' unpaid work and pay £250 compensation. Louis Cashin, 36, of Bedworth, was given a nine-month suspended sentence, ordered to perform 200 hours' unpaid work and pay £1,000 compensation. Albert Blair (left) and Sean Bell (right) both had to pay £250 compensation after admitting their part in the fraud . Albert Blair, 58, of Brownhills, West Midlands received a suspended term of 16 months. He was ordered to pay £250 compensation. And Christopher Thirlwell, 30, of Nuneaton, was handed an eight-month suspended sentence, ordered to perform 150 hours' unpaid work and pay £1,500 compensation. Peter Cook, representing Thirlwell, said it was a 'one-off aberration' that happened when he was in financial difficulty. Tariq Shakoor, for Bell, said he had been taken advantage of.","Gang plundered £195,000 savings after threatening widow, 80, with bailiffs .

"By . Ian Drury for the Daily Mail . The guardsman who pirouetted in front of Buckingham Palace was only pulling a harmless prank, his friends said last night. The soldier has been identified as Grenadier Guard Samuel Holmes. He became an internet sensation when he was filmed prancing outside the Queen’s London home while on duty. Tourists cheered the 20-year-old on as he eased the boredom of a two-hour shift by twirling about in his red tunic and bearskin. Scroll down for video . Named: Samuel Holmes (pictured) has been named as the Grenadier Guardsman facing military prison for pirouetting outside Buckingham Palace . His antics have been viewed more than two million times on YouTube. But the Army and Ministry of Defence are furious that he made a mockery of what is supposed to be a solemn duty. Private Dancer, as he has been dubbed, will have to face the music – and could be handed up to 21 days in military prison and a £1,000 fine. A friend said: ‘Sam is a joker – he is always making the other lads laugh. He’s got loads of videos online of him larking about. And he really loves to dance. ‘The strict routines of Army life can get a bit heavy sometimes and Sam enjoys cheering people up. He had no idea how seriously his latest stunt would be taken – and it has worried his family. Posed up: Mr Holmes's Twitter profile picture appears to show him posed up while in uniform . ‘They were so proud of him and would tell anyone who would listen their son is a guardsman. Now he’s getting attention for the wrong reasons. It was a prank and everyone is hoping his bosses don’t make too much of an example out of him.’ Guardsman Holmes, from Derby, showed off some remarkably elegant moves – but soldiers who guard the Queen are trained to be unflinching and expressionless. The three-minute film shows him strutting around and swinging his hips before launching into the series of pirouettes. A child can be heard saying: ‘That’s really silly. Do you think he will get told off for it by the policeman?’ A military source said that senior officers would probably take a dim view, adding: ‘He is there to guard Buckingham Palace, not provide horseplay for tourists.’ The MoD said that it had launched an investigation. His father Marc, who is also thought to have been a Grenadier guardsman, said: ‘It would be unfair to comment given the Army’s charges hanging over him.’ Online sensation: Footage of the 20-year-old soldier performing ballet-style dance moves to the amusement of waiting tourists has seen by more than 2.25 million people since it was uploaded to YouTube last month . Punishment: The soldier is facing having to complete hours of marching practice and physical fitness tests at a military prison in Colchester, Essex.

"By . Mark Duell for MailOnline . Two men were arrested today on suspicion of murdering a teenage girl who vanished in suspicious circumstances more than seven years ago. Paige Chivers was aged 15 when she disappeared in August 2007 after a row with her father at their seaside home in Blackpool, Lancashire. But despite appeals from police, the girl’s family and even TV chat show host Jeremy Kyle - plus the offer of a £30,000 reward - she has never been found. Seven years on: Paige Chivers (left and right) was aged 15 when she disappeared in August 2007 in Blackpool . Vanished: She left home in Blackpool (pictured) 24 hours after an argument over the phone with her father . The investigation into the . disappearance of Paige - whose mother Sheila died of a heart attack aged . 48, six months before she vanished - is now being treated as a ‘murder . without a body’. Lancashire . Police said today that the two suspects were being held on suspicion of . murdering Paige and attempting to pervert the course of justice . following dawn raids. The pair aged 45 and 59 are being held in custody at an undisclosed police station in the county. Paige . - who attended Montgomery High School in Blackpool - lived with her . late father, Frank, a builder, and brother, Jack, but was ‘very . troubled and angry’ over her mother’s death. Missing person poster: Paige (right) lived with her late father, Frank, a builder, and brother, Jack, in Blackpool . As a younger girl: Paige packed her belongings in her purple suitcase and left home on August 23, 2007 . Appeal: Paige's sister Madison Houghton (right) in August 2009 with Detective Supterintendent Kevin Toole . She left home 24 hours after an argument over the phone with her father over the spending of some family money. Paige packed her belongings in her purple suitcase and left home on August 23. Disappearance: The inquiry into what happened to Paige remains the most heavily-resourced major investigation in Lancashire Police's history . Police believe that after leaving . home, she went to the home of a middle-aged man in the nearby village of . Bispham, to whom she had been introduced by a teenage friend. The man was said to have told . Paige that she could not stay at his home. He claims he walked her to a . nearby bus stop and told her to go to a local drop-in hostel for . troubled children. But she never arrived and has not been seen since. The last confirmed sighting of her by her family was that day getting on a number 11 bus. Detectives received a letter from a mystery person who claimed to know what had happened to the teenager. Police did not reveal the contents of the anonymous note but urged the person who sent it to get in touch. During the inquiry three men and a woman were arrested on suspicion of Paige’s murder - but all were released without charge. The inquiry remains the most heavily-resourced major investigation in Lancashire Police’s history, with more than 2,800 people spoken to as part of the inquiry and over 1,200 statements taken. The investigation has been extended to Peterlee in the North East and the Bolton area where Paige is known to have friends - plus Sheffield, Nottingham, Croydon and the south coast. Police frogman have searched a lake and ponds in the Blackpool area. During a 2010 appeal when Paige would have turned 18, sister Maddison Houghton - who gave birth to a son Connor just days after the teenager vanished - said: ‘All my brothers and sisters are all missing Paige like crazy, and we want her to come home. Paige is very outgoing, she just loved everybody, and very caring. 'You could hear her from everywhere - you could hear her half way down the street. When our mum died Paige couldn’t handle things and she kept it all inside, I think she probably just couldn’t talk about it and decided to go. ‘We just need her to come home so we can scatter my mum’s ashes and we don’t want to do that without her. I really want her to meet Conner because he’s her nephew and she hasn’t seen him and she’d adore him. ‘She had some money inherited in my mum’s will which she can get on her 18th birthday. I just want to make sure and let her know that it’s safe and in the bank and ready for her when she comes home.’ In June police searched land near where she was last seen after receiving new information, but nothing was found. A £30,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of Paige's killer or the recovery of her body has been on offer. A Lancashire Police spokesman said today: ‘Detectives investigating the murder of Blackpool teenager Paige Chivers have this morning arrested two men. ‘The men, aged 45 and 59, from Blackpool, have been arrested on suspicion of murder and attempting to pervert the course of justice and will now be questioned by detectives.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Paige Chivers vanished in suspicious circumstances in August 2007 .

A packet  detailing the beverage writes of the new product ' Inspired by the rise of craft beers, Dark Barrel brings together savory toasty malt and chocolaty tastes topped with sweet dark caramel drizzle. This sophisticated combination offers a delicious complexity that build with every sip.' Other more traditional coffee flavors currently being tested are the Cherries Jubilee Mocha and the Chestnut Praline Latte. Everything you ever need to know: Starbucks published an information packet about their new beverage and say that it is both 'sophisticated'  and 'chocolaty' Some hate it: While some love the Guinness like taste of Starbucks's new drink, others warn against spending money on the drink they find to be disgusting . Nauseated: Some went to far as to say that drinking the beverage in the morning is 'so yuck' and claim that it made them feel sick to their stomach especially during the early hours .","Starbuck's new Dark Barrel Latte is topped with whipped cream and a dark caramel sauce and flavored coffee syrup that tastes like Guinness .

"By . Julian Robinson for MailOnline . A Swedish man has had his rape conviction overturned – after an appeal court heard the attack may have been the result of ‘sexsomnia’. Mikael Halvarsson was cleared of the charge after experts said he had no memory of the alleged assault and was asleep during the incident. Halvarsson was accused after a woman called police claiming she had been attacked on April 2 this year, court documents reveal. A Swedish man has seen his conviction for rape overturned – after an appeal court heard the attack may have been the result of ‘sexsomnia’ (file picture) Translated court documents revealed that they had been sleeping in the same bed with separate blankets,abcNews reports. It adds that Halvarsson was still asleep in her bed when police arrived. But Sundsvall appeals court heard how a previous girlfriend said he had once tried to have sex with her while she was sleeping and that he had acted confused when she stopped him. Along with this testimony, Halvarsson’s mother confirmed that he had suffered from disturbed sleeping patterns in the past, the documents revealed. Sexsomnia is a sleep disorder in which people engage in sexual behaviour while they are asleep – and have no recollection later of the acts they performed. The website quotes Dr Kingman Strohl, a professor of medicine and director of research at the Sleep Center at Case Medical Center in Cleveland, as saying sexsomnia is a medical diagnosis. Dr Strohl, who is unconnected to court case in Sweden, said: 'Usually people are very scared and also quite confused as to what's going on.' He added that doctors would ‘look for signs’ of the patient’s behaviour in their past adding that the condition is rare.","Mikael Halvarsson cleared after experts said he had no memory of incident .

A tree surgeon was decapitated after falling head first into an industrial wood chipper as his sons watched in horror . The unnamed man was working outside a car dealership in Phoenix, Arizona, on Thursday when the accident happened. Witnesses say the victim somehow tripped and fell into the machine . According to police the man was standing on top of the wood chipper and trimming trees. Local news footage from the scene showed the portable wood chipper parked behind a truck bearing a logo for Phoenix Trim-A-Tree, a tree pruning service. 'It's the type of wood chipper where the chute end actually will push the debris into the back of the truck so it can handle large branches,' Detective Seth Tyler said. 'It's extremely powerful.' Grieving family members said the landscaper had worked for the company for years and had plenty of experience. Daughter-in-law Brenda Zapata (pictured) said the landscaper had worked for the company for years and had plenty of experience . The victim's daughter-in-law described him as a 'happy man who loved his family'. Brenda Zapata told KTVK: 'We're never going to see his smiling face one more time. A straw hat lay on the ground next to the wood chipper. Local company Trim-A-Tree confirmed the man was an employee but declined to comment further. In June a Florida man died after falling into a giant wood chipper. Hernan Gutierrez, 42, was working with two other men near a Davie home when he somehow ended up inside the machine. It then pulled his entire body through and instantly killed him, police said. Police arriving at the scene were horrified and needed grief counselors to cope, according to reports.

"By . Mia De Graaf for MailOnline . A former Morgan Stanley executive was caught on tape admitting he filmed sex acts with three women for his own enjoyment, a report claims. John C Kelly, 32, has denied unlawful surveillance, claiming the cameras were simply there to monitor his puggle. But his defense could take a blow as one of his victims is said to have recorded the moment she confronted the financier. Confession? John C Kelly denied secretly filming three women perform sex acts and claimed he was monitoring his puggle Maddy (pictured). But one of his victims allegedly recorded his confession . The recording watched by the New York Post hears Kelly allegedly stammer: 'I'm not innocent, I've said exactly what I've done. 'I lied about having sex with someone else and I videotaped it for my own watching enjoyment. Which is weird but...' His 37-year-old victim, an Ivy League graduate, hits back: 'I didn't know that you were filming it and I trusted you'. Emotional, Kelly continues to take the blame: 'It was once. And I had totally forgotten about it. Like I never had watched it.' The woman, who is Indian, then calls on Kelly to explain why the video was titled 'India Research'. After imploring him to apologize, she is then shouted down with the words: 'Big f–king deal. I never showed anyone.' 'I videotaped it...which is weird': The 32-year-old former financier allegedly confesses all to his victim in a tape . The confrontation is said to have come before Kelly was arrested at his Manhattan apartment last November - around the time he was fired by Morgan Stanley for writing bad checks. He was accused by prosecutors of recording sex acts with three women dozens of times between May 2011 and December 2012,  charged with unlawful surveillance and attempted unlawful surveillance to which he pleads guilty. But Kelly blamed his dog for the videos - claiming he had set up cameras in his Manhattan apartment to keep an eye on his pooch, but the device accidentally caught his sexual escapades. 'It’s on and sometimes stays on. So I accidentally recorded myself having sex because it’s always recording,' police say Kelly told them February 26, 2013. Kelly, son of civil attorney John Q Kelly, also allegedly recorded the women at their own apartments, setting up his open laptop facing the bed and claiming he needed the computer to respond to work emails, the New York Post reported in June. Disgraced: Kelly, the son of a top lawyer, was also fired from Morgan Stanley for writing bad checks . A lawyer for one of the victims says he uploaded at least some of the videos to video sharing sites YouTube and Vimeo. Attorney Daniel Parker, who represents one of the women at the center of the case, argues the X-rated recordings were made using such a sophisticated surveillance system featuring a hidden camera, a webcam and a phone application that it could not have been an accident. Victims ‘did not consent to such images being recorded and defendant did not have permission or authority to record or possess such images,’ prosecutors stated in his arraignment. The breasts, buttocks and vagina of one of the victims could be clearly seen in the video, officials said. The case has been adjourned until December 11.","John C Kelly, 32, is accused of filming sex acts with three women .

"By . Ashley Collman for MailOnline . Kira Kazantsev beat out 52 other young women to become the new Miss America, with her sweet performance of Pharrell's 'Happy' choreographed with a cup. But Kazantsev was no Miss Congeniality at Hofstra University, where she was expelled from her sorority last year for hazing new recruits. On her resume, Kazantsev lists that she was new member educator and recruitment committee president for the university's chapter of Alpha Phi, a position she reportedly shared with her best friend in the spring term of 2013. A source told Jezebel that Kazantsev and her friend made the pledges' lives 'a living hell' by calling them names, and berating them over physical flaws. Scroll down for video . Not nice: New Miss America Kira Kazantsev was allegedly kicked out of her sorority last year for hazing pledges . Silence: Neither Hofstra or the Alpha Phi sorority issued public congratulations to Kazantsev when she was crowned Miss America earlier this month. A picture of Hofstra's Long Island, New York campus picture above . Banned: After someone reported Kazantsev's actions to Hofstra officials, she was kicked out of the sorority and banned from attending any of the society's events. She allegedly sneaked into the end-of-year formal anyway. Pictured above during the swimsuit competition . The terrifying duo reportedly made the new members perform certain physical tasks to the point of bruising and exhaustion. When someone reported the harsh punishments, Kazantsev and her friend were kicked out of the sorority, near the end of her senior year. They were banned from attending any sorority events, but allegedly sneaked into the society's end-of-year formal with their dates anyway. After she was crowned Miss America for 2015 last week, neither the university or the sorority issued statements of congratulations. When a Jezebel reporter called up the university to ask about a 'high-profile individual who was expelled from her sorority in late April 2013', a representative said 'Was this person, by chance, in Atlantic City last Sunday night?' However, that representative wasn't allowed to say more on the disciplinary matter, per FERPA laws. The Miss America organization has since issued a statement on the hazing allegations, saying Kira has been  'fully transparent' about her termination from Alpha Phi. 'It's unfortunate that this incident has been exploited to create a story line that distracts from what we should be focusing on: Kira's impressive academic achievements at Hofstra University, including earning a triple major from the Honors College and her commitment to serving her community. 'Kira is an exceptional ambassador for the Miss America Organization, and we are excited to be a part of her journey as a force for good across our nation, promoting education and service and working to empower young women,' the statement reads. Kazantsev graduated from the Long Island university in 2013 with honors and three degrees in Political Science, Geography and Global Studies. The daughter of Russian immigrants, Kazantsev is fluent in English, Spanish and Russian. She was the third-consecutive Miss New York to be crowned Miss America, and has viciously defended her internship at Planned Parenthood. 'It was close to my university and I care about women's health. It's really important that teens know what resources are available to them and learn to be respectful of their bodies and other peoples' bodies,' she told Cosmopolitan. Harsh: Sources say Kazantsev made the new members' lives 'a living hell' and even made them perform physical tasks to the point of bruising.

"By . Associated Press . The Louisiana congressman whose re-election is threatened by a cheating scandal is putting his marriage front and center in the campaign. Republican U.S. Rep. Vance McAllister released his first TV ad in the 5th District race Monday, prominently featuring his wife Kelly. In the 30-second spot, McAllister describes his 'wonderful, Christian wife,' while his wife describes feeling blessed because her husband 'owns up to his mistakes.' The pair never talks directly about McAllister's infidelity in the ad, but it's the obvious undertone. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . A bit much? Republican Rep. Vance McAllister put his wife in his first re-election campaign ad, just months after he was caught smooching a married female staffer . The other woman: Melissa Anne Hixon Peacock, 33 (right) was the married staffer caught in McAllister's embrace in an April security video at his district office . Over the top: McAllister's ad consultants included a hand-holding shot that prominently features his wife's wedding rings . 'Life is filled with ups and downs,' McAllister says. His wife, sitting by his side, adds: 'But a man's character is based on how many times he gets back up and stands again.' In office less than a year, McAllister's re-election is uncertain after a security video leaked in April showing the father of five kissing a married staffer who was not his wife. The staffer resigned after the video surfaced. Republican leaders called on McAllister to resign, but he refused. Seen as vulnerable in his northeast Louisiana-based district, the GOP incumbent faces eight challengers on the Nov. 4 ballot. He's running without support from his own party, but McAllister said he's running because his wife encouraged him to seek re-election. He said the campaign ad was his wife's idea. 'She wanted me to continue to fight. She said, ""Let's let the people of the district know that we're stronger than we were before, and we're OK"",' McAllister said. 'She's not some politician's wife propped up like a stick, smiling in the background. She wasn't going to be decor. We're a team. And we're going to move forward as a team.' Polls suggest McAllister, from the small town of Swartz, has a significant shot at making the Dec. 6 runoff among the crowded field. But he's lost some of his most well-known supporters from his last campaign. Monroe Mayor Jamie Mayo, a Democrat who supported McAllister in last year's runoff, is running against him. The bearded men of TV's 'Duck Dynasty' who helped draw attention to McAllister last year have abandoned him for family member and candidate Zach Dasher. Meanwhile, amid lackluster fundraising, McAllister's had to pour thousands of his own money into the race, just like he did when he was a political unknown in the 2013 special election that brought him to Washington. McAllister's campaign says the new TV ad will run around the district, with a $75,000 media buy. No heartstring left untugged: McAllister cozies up to one of his five children in the ad -- one likely too young to know why her father is in the spotlight .","Rep.

"By . Corey Charlton for MailOnline . Teacher Bernadette Yuson (pictured) has been sent on administrative leave while the school investigates the incident . A high school teacher has been put on leave following outrage over a student's claim she reseated all the black pupils in her classroom and said she wanted to 'move all the n******s'. Bernadette Yuson, of Cajon High School in San Bernadino, used the racial slur in front of her class on September 3. The comment caused outrage among the community and local advocacy groups who have called for her to be banned from the classroom. The San Bernadino Sun reported student LaRue Bell was in her class on September 3 when she began rearranging the students' seating. The student said he then asked her: 'How come you're moving all the black people around?' She responded: 'Because I want to move all the n*****s.' At a recent town hall meeting, community leaders and the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP) called for her to be banned. Vice president of the San Bernadino NAACP branch A. Marjadi told the meeting: 'If you can refer to our kids as being n*****s, then you don't need to teach them.' The school has placed her on paid leave while they investigate the incident. CBS Los Angeles reported that the San Bernadino school district's spokesperson confirmed the slur was used by Ms Yuson. The statement said: 'We can assure the public that the district took the student’s complaint seriously, and at no time did any district employee minimize the gravity of the impact of the teacher’s words.' The incident occurred at Cajon High School (pictured), in San Bernadino, during a maths class on September 3 . Ms Yuson recently responded to the allegation to put her side of the story across. In her statement, which was uploaded to Scribd, she claimed the student was being disruptive and she heard him yell the word n***** at his classmate. She then responded by stating the word, asking him: 'Wow. N*****? Is that a good word?' While she admitted there was a change of the seating plan she said it was not to move only black students but intended to lessen the whole class from talking to one another.","High school teacher in San Bernadino accused of using racial slur in class .

"By . Corey Charlton for MailOnline . A jet black Rolls Royce Silver Shadow which belonged to legendary country singer Johnny Cash is going up for auction this week. The plush British-built vehicle was gifted to Cash in 1970 by television network ABC when he was at the height of his fame. At the time, Cash - nicknamed the Man in Black because of his trademark black stage outfit - was the star of the network thanks to his successful weekly music variety show The Johnny Cash Show. However, it's not clear how much the vehicle will go for with the auctioneers refusing to name an estimate price and no reserve placed on it. The sleek Rolls Royce Silver Shadow was originally ordered as a gift for singer Johnny Cash . It was used to chauffeur Cash around in the 1970s, but was then sold into private hands the following decade . The TV network's order specifications included it being left hand drive with a privacy partition between the front and back seats, and having Cash's initials emblazoned on to the rear doors . Cash pictured on the set of The Johnny Cash Show in 1969. It was an extremely popular music variety show, for which the ABC television network thanked him by giving him the state of the art Rolls Royce . The luxury classic also boasts a twin-carburettor V8 engine and independent front and rear suspension . The programme featured the great and good of rock and roll and country music including Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell and James Taylor. Cash, then 38, opened each show with a performance and the programme often included songs from his wife June Carter Cash and the Carter Family singers. The show was a hit with viewers, and in recognition ABC forked out $9,500 - around $60,000 or £37,000 in today's money - to have the Roller custom made in Cash's trademark black throughout. They even had his initials JRC embedded into the doors in gold. Cash sold the 1970 long wheelbase Silver Shadow in the mid 1980s and it has since passed through the hands of several private collectors. The luxury classic boasts a twin-carburettor V8 engine, three-speed automatic transmission, independent front and rear suspension and four-wheel disc brakes. The auction house is refusing to place an estimate value on the car and say it is being sold without a reserve . It is going under the hammer with 32,000 miles on the clock at an auction in Las Vegas held by classic car specialists Barrett Jackson. Experts say the historic motor will be auctioned with no reserve - but they are remaining tight-lipped about how much they expect it to sell for. Craig Jackson, chairman of Barrett Jackson, said: 'In the early 1970s Johnny Cash was pulling in phenomenal ratings with his TV show. It ran for 58 episodes and had some of the biggest stars of the time on it. 'It was one of the biggest shows on TV at the time and as a reward ABC gave Johnny this Rolls Royce Silver Shadow - a black Rolls for the 'Man In Black'. 'They paid $9,500 dollars, a substantial amount of money, to have it custom-made in England and shipped out to the USA. To make it even more special they had his initials painted in gold on the rear doors. 'Johnny used it until the mid 1980s when he sold it to a private collector. 'Johnny Cash was a huge star and with this car you're not just buying a piece of rock and roll memorabilia, you're buying something that he actually used. 'There has been a lot of interest in this car. It is in mint condition and it could well be bought by a museum or a fan. 'It's selling with no reserve so it will sell regardless of price. We don't put estimates on cars - we will find out what its real value is on the auction day.'","Music legend Johnny Cash's car up for auction this week with no reserve .

"By . Mailonline Reporter . Ian Burlakoff stretched out on the ground as Officer Robert Cohen pointed a rifle at him, telling the murder suspect not to move. The Florida father of two had just killed his 37-year-old wife Gemma execution style with two shots of his 9mm semi-automatic pistol — the same gun he now had in his waistband as the Boca Raton police officer tried to gain control of the situation. Still lying flat on his stomach, Burlakoff looked up at Officer Cohen and shot him a chilling question: 'Where's your backup?' Then, as a stunned crowd looked on, he began reaching for his pistol and uttered his final words: 'Just kill me.' Officer Cohen fired eight times — striking Burlakoff four times in the chest, back and arm. Ian, 42, was killed instantly. The October 2013 shooting marked the tragic end of the troubled eight-year marriage of the Burlakoffs, the doting parents of four young girls and a popular couple in the luxury resort The Oaks, where they owned a $2 million home. Detectives this week revealed to the South Florida Sun-Sentinel details of the couple's final day, which began with a family day at a beach club — but ended in Gemma's killing and Ian's suicide by police. Florida couple Ian and Gemma  Burlakoff appeared to have it all, but they were engulfed in domestic crisis - from a contentious divorce to their $2 million being in the brink of repossession - that ended in a murder and suicide by cop on Oct. 20, 2013 . The couple had spent that Sunday in 2013 with three of their daughters and another family at the Boca Beach Club, the Sun-Sentinel reported. Halfway through the day, the couple got into a heated argument. It was perhaps their worst fight since Gemma filed for divorce three months earlier. Each side fired off accusations of cheating and overspending. Gemma said in court that Ian wasn't taking medication for his bipolar disorder. That Sunday, an upset Ian picked up two of his daughters, 5 and 7, and walked with them down Ocean Boulevard. Onlookers told authorities the girls appeared to be trying to free themselves as the dad wrapped his arms around them. A few minutes later, Gemma and the couple's friends showed up in an SUV. The wife confronted Ian, giving the girls just enough time to run into the car. The couple continued to argue in the street. One witness said she saw Ian push Gemma to the ground and pull a gun from his pocket. As the witness drove away, she heard the gun shots — two quick bursts from the 9mm pistol. A jogger, who at first thought he'd heard fireworks, walked by and saw Ian still with his gun in hand — his dead wife on the ground. 'Get out of here!' Ian told the man, according to the Sun-Sentinel. The jogger crossed the street, where another witness was on the phone with a 911 dispatcher. Soon they'd watch in horror as Officer Cohen granted Ian's death wish. 'He could have waited where he was and complied with the officer's direction,' an investigator wrote, according to the documents revealed by the Sun-Sentinel. 'He would have survived if he had done so, but he must have known he would be arrested for the murder of his wife, spend the rest of his life in prison and live with the guilt of what he did to his young children.' The Burlakoffs owed between $1.4 million and $1.8 million on their home at the luxury 'The Oaks' resort in Boca Raton and the house was set to be sold at auction if it wasn't paid off in a few months . In court, Gemma Burlakoff said her husband had refused to support their children since she filed for divorce in July 2013. She . said he refused to pay the mortgage, and threatened to shut the home’s . power off if she continued having her mother to the house.

"By . Associated Press . An arrest warrant has been issued for a real estate heir who admitted killing his neighbor in Texas a decade ago, because he failed to show up for a New York City court appearance. Robert Durst's lawyer Steven Rabinowitz says his 73-year-old client is in Texas and unable to travel for undisclosed medical reasons. Durst is facing a trespassing charge following a 2013 arrest at his brother's midtown Manhattan home. He had been told to stay away. Rabinowitz said he expects the warrant to be dismissed when Durst can return. Back to court: Robert Durst is pictured leaving a Houston courtroom in August where he faced charges of criminal mischief for urinating on candy at a CVS. It is just his latest brush with the law and now a warrant is out for his arrest . Robert Durst, who was acquitted of the murder in 2003 after claiming self defense, was arrested in July for allegedly urinating over . $100 worth of candy - Skittles - at the register in a Houston store. The 71-year-old was supposed to appear in court today after being freed on a $5,000 bond, however he did not show up, and now a warrant has been issued for his arrest. The bizarre incident unfolded when he walked in to the store to collect a prescription in July. Accused: Durst allegedly urinated on $100 worth of candy in July after getting in to an argument with staff . 'He picked . up his prescription, and he then exposes himself and pees all over the . cash register and candy at the register and then walks out and walks . down the street,' Houston police spokeswoman Jodi Silva said at the time. 'He wasn't arguing with anybody and he didn't seem agitated. He just peed on the candy. Skittles, I think.' But . Durst has been making headlines for years - first over his wife's . mysterious disappearance and then over the murder of his elderly . neighbor in 2001. in which he admitted killing his . neighbor and dumping the remains into Galveston Bay. He claimed . self-defense and was acquitted of homicide. His father, Seymour, was a New York real estate mogul who amassed billions . of dollars worth of commercial property in Manhattan. Robert, a . well-connected socialite, worked for his father's Durst . Organization for years as a developer. But he was estranged from his . family around 1994 after being passed over as heir to the company . leadership in favour of his brother Douglas. The . Houston Chronicle reported that in 2006 he finally won a $65 million . court settlement from his family, restoring a piece of his family . fortune. Questions: Durst, with his wife Kathleen Durst, was suspected to be responsible for her 1982 disappearance . Ten years earlier, Durst had gained infamy in New York . due to the mysterious disappearance of his wife, Kathie, and many believed the real estate scion had something to do with it. He was questioned in her murder - and in the murder of her friend when the case was re-opened in 2000 - but was never charged. He has now re-married, KTRK reported, but the identity of his new wife was not released. Then in September 2001, remnants of the body of Morris . Black, Durst's next-door neighbor in the boarding house where he was . living, were found floating in the Galveston Bay in . Galveston, Texas. A trail of blood led police back to an apartment being rented by a mute woman, . Dorothy Ciner - who was actually Durst in a dress. It emerged that Durst had gone into hiding for years, partially to escape the increasing inquiries about the death of his wife. Killer: Durst is pictured left in a police . booking photo in 2001 after he was arrested for the murder of neighbor . Morris Black, right. At the time of the killing, he had been . cross-dressing to conceal his real identity . Acquitted: He admitted to shooting and dismembering Black but claimed he had acted in self-defense after they argued over a gun. He was acquitted and served a year for tampering with evidence . After . spending a month on the run, Durst tried to steal a chicken . salad sandwich and a single a Band-Aid from a supermarket in . Philadelphia while wearing a blond mustache and was arrested. Durst . admitted to shooting Black and dismembering him before dumping the body parts in the Bay. But he insisted that he had acted in self defense as they struggled over a handgun and he was acquitted. But . he was found guilty for tampering with evidence over the disposal of . the body and was sentenced to five years in prison, but served just one. Despite his run-ins with the law, he still has access to his $43 million trust fund, which he has used to buy and develop real estate in New York. The Durst Organization is a billion-dollar real estate company that owns several skyscrapers. In July, it was reported that Durst sold two Brooklyn buildings for . $21.15 million, after buying them for $8.65 million in 2011.","Robert Durst, 71, was in Texas, where he lives, instead of Manhattan Criminal Court on Monday because of medical issues, his attorney said .

"By . MailOnline Reporter . Shocking images of physical injuries suffered by a toddler whose body was found in the woods were taken by family members months before his death but no-one went to the police. The remains of Colton Brandt Turner, two, of Austin, Texas, were found in a wooded area of southeast Austin less than two days after officials received a call from a friend of his mother who was concerned about the young boy's whereabouts. Since then, investigators have learned that disturbing photos of Colton had been shared and even posted online for months. Scroll down for video . Shocking images of injuries suffered by Colton Brandt Turner, two, of Austin, Texas, who was found dead in the woods were taken by family members months before but no-one went to the police . No one has been charged with physical abuse in connection with his death. His mother Megan Work, 20, and her boyfriend, Michael Brandt Turner, 29, have been charged with tampering with physical evidence, a second-degree felony that carries a sentence of up to 20 years in prison. Work's friend Briana Spieldenner, who initially notified officials, said that Work's cousin contacted her on Facebook last week and sent her the photos which were taken nearly two months ago. [She] said, 'Look, I'm worried about Colton,' recalled Spieldenner. The pictures of Turner show his tiny body body bruised and scratched. Spieldenner contacted Work, who assured her Colton was fine, but she took the photos to Cedar Park Police Department. Work's friend Briana Spieldenner, who initially notified officials, said that Work's cousin contacted her on Facebook last week and sent her the photos which were taken nearly two months ago . Tragic end: The body of two-year-old Colton turner was found last week and his mother Megan Work is now in police custody (both pictured above) Work is also four months pregnant, according Spieldenner. Colton's mother's boyfriend Michael Turner confessed to Cedar Park police detective Justin Miller. 'We were lucky enough to have them separated to where they couldn't talk about this,' said Miller, reports KVUE.com. 'While they maybe had months before tried to work out a story, there were so many holes in it we were able to kind of play to those holes.' Miller, along with an FBI agent, drove to the San Saba County Jail Thursday to interview Turner after the department received a call Wednesday night worried Colton was missing. Turner was being held at the jail on charges unrelated to Colton's disappearance. A day later Turner revealed where Colton's body had been hidden and took them to the site where he admitted burying the body on Felter Lane in Austin two months prior in July. According to an arrest affidavit, Work told police inconsistent stories, among them that the toddler hit his head on an air-conditioning unit inside a motel room July 6. Work had been living out of her car or with friends for the past several months. Texas Child Protective Services had received four total complaints beginning when Colton was about six months old, according to the sources reports KVUE News. Two of the complaints had been resolved, but it was not immediately clear how. The other two were open and on-going when investigators discovered Colton's body. Her older sister Tyler has spoken of her frustration towards Child Protective Services. Work had been living out of her car or with friends for the past several months . 'I've had random family members tell me that, ""I called CPS on Meagan, and they didn't do anything, and they told me they would call me back.""' 'And it's like they don't even live here. They live five hours away, and they called CPS on Meagan, and no one did anything about it,' said Tyler, reports 12 News. Tyler said that she saw Work at their mother's funeral in February and said Colton looked neglected. 'He seemed fine. He didn't, I mean, he didn't have any bruises or scratches on him or anything but he, I mean, I guess he was wearing clothes that were too small for him. 'He looked like, I mean I just don't want to say. He didn't look OK,' Tyler said. 'He just looked like he wasn't being taken care of. You know, he just didn't look clean,' she said. The Texas Division of Child Protective Services said it ‘had involvement’ with Work, but did not outline a timeline of when CPS first learned about the complaints, reports KXAN. Julie Moody, a spokesperson for CPS told the news station that tracking down parents who may be homeless or living from house to house can be complex after a complaint or allegation is made. In late 2013, Work pleaded guilty to animal cruelty. She also pleaded guilty to assault causing bodily injury stemming from a May 2013 incident where she hit another woman.","The body of Colton Brandt Turner, two, was found  Texas last week .

Each of the units, which according to Curbed were inspired by ship construction, features a bedroom, living room, kitchen and hidden storage. However, there's no oven. But with a clientele that generally consists of recent college grads, that sort of omission is okay. 'They travel really light. They might have a bike and two suitcases,' J. Michael Abbott of Northeast Collaborative Architects told Curbed. The once-struggling mall offered space on the first floor to retailers, some of whom even chose to take advantage of the convenient real estate upstairs. The project is part of a rise of shoebox living in major cities across the country where, reports Bloomberg, restrictions on the low end of residence sizes have been lowered--some to as small as 220-square-feet. The Providence Arcade opened to tenants in October 2013 at a cost of $7 million. Investors are likely feeling good about the project.

Scroll down for video . Victim: Jill Tarlov, pictured, is reportedly brain-dead after being struck by Jason Marshall's bicycle Thursday . NYPD investigators canvas the scene of the crash in Central Park . 'My wife was beautiful in every way imaginable,' Mr Wittman wrote. 'Jill was the most amazing mother to Matthew and Anna, who taught them above all that kindness, compassion, and a spirit for life were the right morals to live by. Everyone who had ever met her was somehow made better by her company. 'Even though she has been taken from us far too soon, her spirit will live on forever. On behalf of our family, I would like to thank everyone for their thoughts and prayers, and request privacy during the difficult times ahead,' Mr Wittman said. It's unclear whether her family took her off life support. Tarlov also used to work at CBS, and the company issued a statement following her death, saying they would work to help prevent similar tragedies in the future. 'We are heartsick over the passing of our dear friend and former 1010 WINS Radio colleague Jill Tarlov,' Anton Guitano, chief operating officer of CBS Local Media and Peter Dunn, presiden tof CBS television, said in a joint statement. Seeking advice? Marshall Marshall, though not charged, reportedly visited the same building where a law firm is located on Friday .

"By . Ted Thornhill for MailOnline . A description of John Kerry by Isis as an ‘uncircumcised old geezer’ is further evidence of British involvement in the militant organisation, a terrorism expert has said. The comment about the U.S Secretary of State came in an audio recording by Isis spokesman Abu Mohammad al-Adnani. He said: 'The uncircumcised old . geezer, suddenly became an Islamic jurist, issuing a verdict to the . people that the Islamic State was distorting Islam, that what it was . doing was against Islamic teachings, and that the Islamic State was an . enemy of Islam.' Connection: The use of the word 'geezer' in the translation of al-Adnani's description of John Kerry is yet more evidence of strong ties between Britain and Isis, according to an expert . Professor Anthony Glees, head of the . centre for security and intelligence studies at the University of . Buckingham, said the use of British slang was hugely significant. He told MailOnline: ‘I'd say the use of . the word ""geezer"" is a massively important further giveaway about the . identity of some of these Isis thugs. It's a term most usually heard in . London. 'So Isis have drawn us, I'd suspect intentionally, back towards reflecting on the fact that Brits are fighting for these sadistic butchers, taunting not just the families of the hostages but our government and our position in the world.' His comments came as experts revealed that the terrorist group is using its control of oil fields to fund its brutal operations. Britain's link to Islamic State became known around the world after shocking videos showed a British man known as 'Jihadi John' executing American journalists James Foley, 40, and Steven Sotloff, 31, as well as British aid worker David Haines, 44. Some sources believe that Jihadi John comes from a South London suburb about 10 miles from Central London. Professor Glees added: 'It's my understanding that MI5 and the counter-terrorism police do know the identity of ""John"" but that like the UK government more generally they don't see any advantage at this stage in telling the rest of us, not so much out of consideration to ""John's"" family but to the hostages because this is about the lives of innocent hostages here, and every move that we take needs to be very carefully considered before we take it.' Low blow: The group called John Kerry an 'uncircumcised old geezer' after his comments that the terrorist organization 'did not represent Islam' in front of the House Foreign Affairs Committee . It was made as a fuller picture emerged of Isis's vast wealth - estimated to be around $1.5billion - and slick operation. One Syrian told the Financial Times that he had a job interview with Isis to work in its media centre in Raqqa, Syria's capital, and that he was amazed at the salary he was offered and the equipment he would have at his disposal. The man, who turned the job down, said: 'They offered me $1,500 a month [five times the average Syrian salary], plus a car, a house and all the cameras I needed. I remembered looking around the office. It was amazing the equipment they had in there.' The U.S is becoming increasingly focussed on finding out precisely where the group's money is coming from. Barack Obama and other leaders will discuss the issue at next week's annual United Nations General Assembly. And a new U.S-based research group called the Counter Extremism Project is poised to release to governments and media outlets a database of information about militants and their supporters. It's convinced that Isis is generating a great deal of wealth from shady deals with morally compromised companies. Risk management group Maplecroft believes that Isis controls half a dozen oil fields in Syria and four in Iraq, with many officials convinced it's making millions from smuggling barrels to Turkey, Iran and Iraq. The group is also known to make money from kidnappings, extortion and robbery. More airstrikes are expected this week against the group, and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power said on Face The Nation Sunday morning that other countries were willing to join the U.S. in these strikes, though she would not say what countries. These strikes have already begun in Iraq, and been authorized to begin in Syria by Obama. In addition, the Senate approved a bill to train and arm moderate Syrian rebels to battle Islamic State militants.","Isis called John Kerry an 'uncircumcised geezer' in an audio recording .

"By . Ap  Reporter . On the surface, it almost looks as though someone has installed a hot tub in the middle of a lake - bubbling jets of water breaking the otherwise perfectly calm waters of the Sheyenne River. But these aren't bubbles, and, far from someone having added a touch of spa luxury to the North Dakota stretch of water, this perfectly spherical disturbance in the water is made of ice. The incredible spinning circle of ice, which was spotted by George Loegering while out hunting with relatives, is entirely natural albeit extremely rare. Scroll down for video . Spinning disc: Experts say a combination of cold, dense air last weekend and an eddy in the river likely caused this 'rare' ice circle in a North Dakota river . The retired engineer said that when he first saw the floating disc he couldn't believe his eyes. The 73-year-old said: 'At first I thought, no way! It was surreal. You looked at it and you thought, how did it do that?' He calculated the disk's diameter to be about 55 feet, took photos and videos of it and then turned to the internet for more information about what he, his brother-in-law and nephew had seen. 'It's not an unknown phenomenon, but it is relatively rare,' said Loegering, who lives in rural Casselton, about 20 miles west of Fargo. Allen Schlag, a National Weather Service hydrologist in Bismarck, and Greg Gust, a weather service meteorologist in Grand Forks, said a combination of cold, dense air last weekend and an eddy in the river likely caused the disk. 'It's actually quite beautiful,' Schlag said. 'It's not a continuous sheet of ice,' explains National Weather Service hydrologist for Bismarck, Allen Schlag . The cold, dense air — the air pressure Saturday in nearby Fargo was a record high for the city for the month of November, according to Gust — turned the river water into ice, but since the water was relatively warm it didn't happen all at once. Floating bits of ice got caught in the eddy and started to spin in a circle. 'It's not a continuous sheet of ice,' Schlag said. 'If you were to throw a grapefruit-size rock on it, it would go through. 'It's not a solid piece of ice — it's a collection of ice cubes.' Loegering said the spinning disk had frozen up but was still visible in the river. The phenomenon is not unknown in the Arctic, Scandanavia and Canada, but pretty rare elsewhere. Normally they are thought to occur at bends in the river where the accelerating water creates a force called 'rotational shear', which breaks off a chunk of ice and twists it around. As the disc rotates, it grinds against surrounding ice - smoothing into a perfect circle. North Dakota locals who have been admiring the ice circle are wondering how long it will last. The Sheyenne River freezes over each winter . Mr Loegering said: 'I'm not sure how long it was there (spinning),' he said. 'It had to be quite a long time. 'If you look at the picture, you can see growth rings on the disk.' Mr Schlag said he was surprised by the size of the ice circle, which he said would be more likely on a larger river such as the Missouri. 'That might be one of the better examples I've seen,' he said. 'It's a pretty cool one.'","A naturally-occurring phenomenon has developed in North Dakota's Sheyenne River, which feeds into the Red River north of Fargo .

Lesley Berry, 27, from Walsall, developed muscle spasms following a stroke but is having Botox jabs to aid her recovery . ‘This is one of the most important advances for years,’ says Professor Anthony Ward, of the North Staffordshire Rehabilitation Centre. ‘By allowing the ankle to function more normally, this can bring important mobility and physical benefits to patients, even those who have been suffering from this condition for many years.’ Stroke affects at least 150,000 Britons a year and there are more than a million stroke survivors  in the UK. Up to 30 per cent live with muscle stiffness, known as post-stroke spasticity. One person who already knows the benefits of Botox is Lesley Berry, 27, who developed dystonia – a condition that causes muscles to spasm – following a stroke. Lesley was affected throughout her left side, and her left hand  was permanently clamped into a claw. It was so bad that she was unable even to hold a cup of tea. Physiotherapy and the blood-thinning medication warfarin both failed to aid her recovery and she grew so self-conscious that she barely went out. It was only when Lesley started receiving regular Botox jabs that her body bounced back. Green light: Botox will be used by the NHS for treatment of limb problems after being licensed by a medical watchdog . ‘Both the stroke and its aftermath were incredibly scary,’ she says. ‘I couldn’t eat or talk or even go to the toilet by myself. I had to start everything from scratch, like a baby. When the medication and physio didn’t work, I began to despair. But Botox has helped me lead a normal life again.’ Stroke patients benefit because the botulinum toxin freezes stiff muscles to stop them spasming, and restores control of the limb. Previous research suggested injections could help stroke victims regain movement in arms and hands. The new study shows it can help lower limbs too, allowing feet to function normally and straightening a stuck or ‘drop’ foot. Lesley, from Walsall, suffered her stroke in November 2008. ‘One day I tried to get up off the sofa and couldn’t move,’ she says. ‘I tried to speak and slurred my words. Then I collapsed.’ She was rushed to hospital, where an MRI scan revealed a huge blood clot on the right side of her brain. ‘I had no power in my legs and had to be spoon-fed puree,’ she says. ‘I was terrified.’ Three weeks of intensive physiotherapy in hospital taught her to take tentative steps on her own. But life was far from normal. ‘I’d fall asleep from the exhaustion of walking,’ she says. ‘There was no way I could go back to my stressful job running a wine bar.’ The following September she developed an irregular heartbeat and was prescribed warfarin. But neither that, nor weekly physio, made much improvement. In early 2010, Lesley began to despair when she developed dystonia – constant spasming of the muscles. ‘I lost control over my left arm,’ she says. ‘The pain was intense. It travelled down my arm from my shoulder and stopped me sleeping. My arm was permanently clenched into my body and my left hand was like a claw. If I did manage to hold a glass, I would smash it as I had no control.’ In May 2010 she was prescribed Botox by her doctor, Poovathoor J. Alexander, Consultant Physician in Neurological Rehabilitation for Walsall Healthcare Trust. He explains: ‘It blocks the release of a chemical called acetylcholine from the nerve, which stops the muscle contracting. ‘It starts to work within four to seven days, reaches its peak function within six weeks, and should last at least four months.’ Lesley was given eight 1mg jabs – four in her biceps and four in her forearm. She found the injections ‘incredibly painful’ but, unlike other drugs used for stroke, Botox doesn’t have any known side effects on the liver or kidneys. Dr Alexander says Botox can actually improve muscle function. ‘It must be used in conjunction with physiotherapy to stop the muscles getting stiff,’ he says. ‘It relaxes the muscle injected so it is easier to stretch it. Lesley had a splint to keep her fingers stretched. ‘Each treatment costs up to £1,000, and hopefully Lesley will eventually be able to lead a normal life without it, but it’s difficult to say how many courses a patient will need.’ Lesley still has Botox every six months and is now well enough to take a degree at Coventry University. She says: ‘It’s made an incredible difference. My arm muscles stopped spasming and it was wonderful being able to uncurl my hand. Best of all, the pain stopped, I’ve got my confidence back. ‘There was a time I thought I’d never lead a normal life but thanks to  the Botox I’m happy again. I don’t want to build up a dependence but as long as it keeps being effective I’ll carry on having it.’","Botox will be used by the NHS for treatment of limb problems .

Fabio Borini is poised to join Queens Park Rangers after the west London club agreed a £10million deal with Liverpool for the striker. The Italian had been linked with a move back to Sunderland after spending last season on loan at the Stadium of Light, but that deal has now completely collapsed due to the prohibitive cost of a permanent deal. Borini will join Steven Caulker (£8m), Jordon Mutch (£6m), Leroy Fer and Rio Ferdinand (free) to have joined the Loftus Road Club this summer.| . VIDEO Scroll down for Harry Redknapp on QPR's desperate need for new players . On the move: Fabio Borini is set to join Queens Park Rangers after a £10million fee was agreed for the striker . The 23-year-old Italian striker struggled to make the grade at Liverpool, although he was fans' favourite at Sunderland on loan last season. This is shown by the fact he has just one league goal in 13 appearances for Liverpool. He managed seven in 32 league matches for Sunderland during his loan spell and some were crucial in keeping the Black Cats up. It was after a few of these goals that we saw his celebration, which sees him thrust his left hand to his teeth. He explains: 'In Italy it means you've got the knife between your teeth - it's when you want to achieve something so badly that you are angry to reach your goals.' Callum Wilson . Harry Redknapp also hopes to sign Sandro from Tottenham before the transfer window closes. The Black Cats had wanted to take Borini on loan, but that option was ruled out once Sebastian Coates joined as Premier League rules don't allow clubs to sign more than one player on loan from the same team. Redknapp was in the market for a new striker after Loic Remy joined Chelsea. Borini notched seven goals in a productive spell with Sunderland last season, leaving Gus Poyet keen to secure the 23-year-old's services on a repeat temporary deal. Former Uruguay midfielder Poyet said after Sunderland's 1-0 loss at QPR on Saturday that he remained hopeful of securing a deal for Borini before Monday night's transfer deadline. 'I know how people feel but unfortunately we cannot give you all the information, all the true information on why he's not with us,' he said. 'I know from the outside it looks like it's him not wanting to come to Sunderland because of whatever, but I can promise you it's not like that.' Value: Liverpool wanted a return on the £12m they spent on Borini, rather than letting him leave on loan .","Fabio Borini is set to move to Queens Park Rangers from Liverpool .

"By . Ruth Styles . With his forked tongue, razor-sharp fangs and horns that poke from his forehead, Diablo Delenfer, 43, from Kent, looks like most people's idea of a terrifying demon. Now the former security guard and self-described 'body modification artist' is to have screws implanted into his skull in a bid to create a devilish metal mohawk. But because 'body modification' is unlicensed and unregulated in the UK, the entire operation will be done without anaesthetic. Scroll down for video . Terrifying: Delenfer, 43, has spent £10,000 on his bid to look exactly like Lucifer - complete with devilish horns . Transformation: Delenfer in 2009 at the beginning of his quest to become Beelzebub's doppelganger . 'Everything I've done, I've done fully . conscious, fully awake,' he explains. 'You see the needle coming towards you and that's . really stressful. You can't be scared of pain if you're the Devil Man.' Among the operations that Diablo Delenfer - real name Gavin Paslow - has so far endured are having his tongue sliced in two to fork it, sub-dermal implants to create a set of horns and an eyeball tattoo that has turned the whites of his eyes bright red. But despite the pain, the 43-year-old insists he has no plans to stop. 'I describe myself as a body modification . artist,' he explains. 'I am a human curiosity but body modification is my life's . journey. It's a little bit weird, a little bit eccentric but that's what . I am.' He adds: 'I chose to become the Devil Man because everything . else has been done, whether here or in America. I'm not Satanic at all - it's . just a piece of fun.' It's certainly an expensive piece of fun, with Delenfer confessing to spending more than £10,000 on his transformation so far. 'Over the years, it's probably cost me £10,000 to look like this,' he explains. 'Being a Devil Man doesn't come cheap!' It hasn't been cheap for the taxpayer either: In 2009, Delenfer was caught swindling £3,552 by making a series of fraudulent benefit claims and was sentenced to 200 hours of community service. Speaking outside court after the trial, the divorced father-of-two said: 'I was really constrained by money and I just wanted to have these modifications done so I used my benefit money to pay for some of them. 'It was a stupid mistake and I'm really sorry. I'm paying it all back. I really regret it.' He added: 'But I'm pleased with my look so far, but what I really want is a tail. And not just a synthetic one - a proper, organic tail.' Inspiration: Lucifer as portrayed by French engraver Gustave Doré in a plate from Dante's Divine Comedy . While Delenfer is yet to realise his ambition of getting an organic tail, he has since had his ears made pointy and endured a series of painful tattoos that now cover his face and arms. Although Delenfer says he's happy with his unusual looks, he does admit that looking like Lucifer has made his quest to find a girlfriend fraught with pitfalls. 'Relationships . is a bit of a difficult issue to be honest,' he confesses. 'I'm looking for someone who . can see beyond the mask. 'It has changed the way people look at me, accept and deal with me. It has made certain aspects like relationships . difficult but it is my life journey and I ain't stopping!' I . do get a lot of attention from people walking down the street and I do . have fun with it. Some people are scared and some don't understand but . it is just a bit of fun.

"By . Rebecca Evans . Taunts and ridicule: Ellie James, 44, was 30 when her sweat, breath and urine started to smell of fish . For 14 years, Ellie James has been blighted by an incredibly rare and embarrassing genetic disorder. The company director, 44, is one of only a handful of people with a condition that leaves her smelling of fish or rotten eggs. But it took seven years to finally diagnose her after doctors dismissed her concerns – and even gave her humiliating lectures on personal hygiene and how to wash properly. The disorder, known as trimethylaminuria, or fish-odour syndrome, has had a devastating impact on her life since it developed when she was 30. Dubbed ‘smelly Ellie’ by bullies, she has been taunted and ridiculed by strangers. She is the butt of office jokes – receiving soap or perfume as secret Santa presents – and has even had bottles of body spray posted anonymously through her letter box. Miss James, from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, said: ‘At first I didn’t understand what was wrong. I’d always had impeccable hygiene. The smell was a complete mystery – I wondered if my cat had brought in a mouse and left it to rot. ‘But I slowly realised it was me when strangers began to stare at me while holding their noses. I heard people whispering about me in the office. ‘I would come home from work every night and cry. Soon people were showering me with gifts of perfume. At Christmas I’d get soap – it was completely humiliating. ‘Once a driver actually installed an air freshener on the bus I use, and a passenger said it was my fault. It was soul-destroying – it was a real struggle getting out of bed in the morning.’ At one point Miss James was having a bath five times a day. And in desperation she resorted to scrubbing her skin with kitchen detergent until it was red raw. Teased: Her workmates would give Ellie soap and perfume as presents in the office secret Santa as a joke . ‘I was at my wits’ end,’ she told the Sunday Mirror. The condition is caused by an enzyme missing which causes a strong odour in sweat, urine and breath – usually described as like rotting fish, faeces or rubbish. It is created when the body is unable to break down the smelly chemical trimethylamine that is produced in the gut when certain foods, such as dairy, coffee, meat and fish, are digested, and there is currently no cure. After suffering with the condition for five years, Miss James plucked up the courage to visit her GP in 2005, but she was left feeling humiliated after being lectured on personal hygiene. As a result, she did not return to see her doctor until a year later, when she was finally taken seriously. Treatment: Finally, after persuading her GP to reassess her condition, she was referred to a hormone specialist who put her on an intense programme of antibiotics and a unique diet, which has calmed her symptoms . Tests were carried out and she was eventually diagnosed in 2007. She said: ‘Although it was hard to swallow, I felt relief.’ Miss James was referred to an endocrinologist – an expert on hormones – who put her on antibiotics and a diet plan. She said: ‘I began to wash with a pH-balanced soap after I found out that washing excessively with normal soap made the smell even worse. There is no cure but making these changes helps.’ She added: ‘Now, when someone holds their nose, I take them aside and explain that I have a medical condition. I hope my story will help educate those who point fingers, and encourage other sufferers to find the strength to get help.’ Miss James’s partner, Dan Molston, 50, said: ‘Ellie is a lovely person and that’s all that matters.’","Ellie James contracted trimethylaminuria, 'fish-odour syndrome', aged 30 .

"By . Chris Brooke . Updated: . 10:40 EST, 21 September 2011 . A philandering music teacher who murdered his fiancée following a string of affairs was also cheating with a 15-year-old pupil. Andrew Lindo, 29, had ‘sexual activity’ with the impressionable girl who was one of his music students and fell victim to his ‘charms’. The underage sex was revealed after Lindo was found guilty of murdering Marie Stewart, the mother of his two children, and then hiding her body in a flight bag in the couple’s garage. Guilty: Andrew Lindo murdered his fiancée Marie Stewart who was found dead at the family home in Holmfirth, West Yorkshire . Duped: Alison Doram, left, and Angela Rylance, right, were two of the women who fell for Lindo's lies, but there could be more women that he had affairs with who were not involved in the trial . As well as the relationship with the young girl, to whom he sent an . indecent photo, he was also leading a complex ‘double life’ with two . fiancées and other lovers. The jury, who reached their verdict in only 55 minutes, had not been . told the full depravity of the sex-obsessed teacher during the . three-week trial. Hours after the murder he texted the underage girl while his other fiancée Angela Rylance was waiting for him in his bed. Miss Stewart in her graduation gown at the university where she met . Lindo. Right, his lover, Angela Rylance, arriving at Bradford Crown . Court to hear the verdict yesterday . There were emotional scenes at Bradford Crown Court as the parents and . sister of the dead woman cried and hugged each other after the verdict . was announced. He was never charged with underage sex because it only . emerged after he had been arrested for murder. Lindo showed no emotion when the verdict was announced. He is due to be given a mandatory life sentence today. He admitted unlawfully killing his fiancée, but claimed he ‘lost . control’ because he believed she was mistreating his daughter and said . he was not a murderer. But the court heard how Lindo cheated on Miss Stewart, 30, with several . women who believed his web of lies and thought he was a single parent . living alone. Miss Rylance, 29, suspected he was lying about his personal life and he . went through with the terrible crime to convince her he was telling the . truth. On the day Miss Rylance was due to sleep the night for the first time at . his house in Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, he disposed of his fiancée with . appalling violence, the court heard. Lindo throttled her, then bashed her over the head with a Winnie the . Pooh child’s chair before stabbing her 12 times and putting her body in . the flight bag. After cleaning the scene he woke the children and drove to pick up Miss Rylance as arranged. For seven weeks Lindo convinced Miss Stewart’s family and friends she . was still alive, setting up an elaborate smokescreen using Facebook and . texts from her mobile phone to tell everyone she had left him and moved . abroad. Marie's mother, Helen, arriving at court during the trial where she and her family were described as acting with 'dignity and restraint' He believed he could lie his way out of trouble yet again. This time he failed. When friends and family became suspicious, the police were called. They searched the house and found the decomposing body on February 13. In pursuit of sexual gratification Lindo had no scruples and he left a . trail of broken hearts in his wake. It is not known how many women he . deceived, but there are thought to be others who did not feature in his . trial. Lindo betrayed anyone’s trust without a pang of guilt. An extrovert with . a boyish smile and natural charm, Lindo discovered how to impress the . opposite sex at university and became an outrageous womaniser. As well as teaching music to children, Lindo was a singer and bass . player in the band Battered Soul and knew how to ‘perform’. He pretended . to be a devoted single parent to gain the sympathy of his would-be . conquests. The son of a property developer and financial adviser, Lindo was brought . up on Teesside and devoted his energies to two interests – music and . women. It all started at Huddersfield University where Lindo studied music and was good friends with Martin Waldron. Waldron married Marie Stewart, a fellow undergraduate studying health . and community studies, in 2005. But the marriage didn’t last long . because she fell in love with Lindo and by 2007 they were living . together and she was pregnant. She and Lindo became devoted parents of a little girl and in January . 2010 they had a son. One friend remarked that they seemed ‘almost the . perfect family’. But on Lindo’s part the domestic bliss was a charade. While his partner . was pregnant with their second child he was simultaneously cheating with . two women colleagues at the Take 2 stage school in Barnsley where he . worked. He cleverly stopped Alison Doram, 27, and Amy Wilde, 26, finding out . they were seeing him at the same time by telling them both that the . other fancied him and was jealous. Miss Doram, a dance teacher, had a five-month sexual relationship with . Lindo, believing Miss Stewart had walked out on him and the children. ‘Andrew was really friendly and easy to talk to, a charmer,’ she said. ‘I believed I was in a relationship with him exclusively.’ Even when she saw Miss Stewart’s Facebook page indicating she was living . with Lindo, he convinced her it was a ‘tactic’ in their custody dispute . over their daughter. But she ended their relationship after reading on Facebook that Miss . Stewart’s status had been changed to ‘engaged to Andrew’ on Valentine’s . Day last year. Confused and emotional, she spoke to Miss Wilde and discovered she had . also dated Lindo the previous October. That relationship amounted to . going out on dates and ‘kissing and cuddling’. Far more shocking was Lindo’s relationship with one of his best pupils . at another school where he taught music. The girl of 15, who has since . passed more than 12 GCSEs, was lured into the illicit relationship, . which Lindo denied after his arrest. Miss Rylance, a mother-of-two who had separated from her partner, fell . for Lindo when he walked into the shop where she worked. She believed he . was a single parent and they began a passionate affair. Eventually she became suspicious he was lying about Miss Stewart and . told him she wouldn’t be convinced until she spent a night in his house. They agreed to have the sleepover on December 18 last year – the day of . the murder. He even took time during the brutal assault to text Miss . Rylance that he would be late picking her up. She was there on Christmas Day and saw the New Year in with the man with . whom she planned to spend her future and they were soon looking for a . house to share. But before long Lindo was arrested and Miss Rylance discovered she had . been the latest innocent young woman to be taken in by an evil cheat.","Andrew Lindo toasted 'best Christmas ever' with his lover as wife's body was in garage .

"By . Emily Davies . Hilary Mantel was given the powerful drug during a hospital stay . Author Hilary Mantel claims to have found inspiration for her forthcoming book of short stories about Margaret Thatcher while high on morphine. The double Booker prize winner admitted she had hallucinations while in hospital during which a key character in her book The Assassination of Margaret Thatcher appeared to her. Miss Mantel had been receiving treatment for the womb condition endometriosis when she was given morphine as a painkiller. ‘That story I started years and years ago and I could not get it right,’ she said. ‘The first night I was in hospital full of morphine I simply stayed up all night making up stories. And one of the things that happened was that I saw the assassin. I knew exactly who he was. So the missing piece of that story dropped into place. ‘I made up some other stories too. It wasn’t me going temporarily mad; it was a drug-induced thing. But as a writer you try and use everything.’ The author, 61, told The Observer that, despite the experience, she had not been tempted to dabble with drugs to fuel her writing since. ‘It was a one-off,’ she said. ‘For every profitable idea, I think, ten are going to be garbage. My problem is never ideas. My problem is time.’ The Assassination of Margaret Thatcher features ten stories about the late prime minister in ‘contemporary settings’ and is due to be published later this year. Her publisher, Nicholas Pearson of 4th Estate, has said the collection shows ‘the country we have become’. Miss Mantel is best known for her historical novels Wolf Hall and Bring up the Bodies. She won the Man Booker Prize for Fiction for both, making her the first woman and first British author to have won the award twice. The book is a collection of ten short stories about Margaret Thatcher in 'contemporary settings' She has attracted controversy in the past after claiming that the Duchess of Cambridge was being portrayed as a ‘shop-window mannequin’ whose only purpose was to breed. During a lecture at the British Museum, Miss Mantel criticised Kate for appearing to have been ‘gloss-varnished’ with a perfect plastic smile in contrast to the late Princess of Wales, who she described as awkward and emotionally incontinent. She went on to suggest that the ‘painfully thin’ Duchess was selected for her role of princess because she posed no risk of showing any character.","Author says key character came to her in morphine induced hallucination .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Samsung has overtaken Apple to become the world’s most profitable mobile phone company. Apple’s share of the smartphone market dropped to 14 per cent, its lowest for three years, because of ‘lacklustre’ iPhone 5 sales and tougher competition from rivals, according to industry analysts. Driven by demand for cheaper Android devices in Asia and Latin America, Samsung’s handset  division made an estimated £3.4billion operating profit in the second quarter of this year. Samsung's president J.K. Shin, pictured, holds up the firm's Galaxy S4 phone during its launch in March. Samsung has reported record profits for the second quarter of 2013 and sold more than double the handsets than Apple. Apple's market share has fallen to a three-year low . 1. Apple iPhone 5 (16GB) 2.

Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini . Source: uSwitch as of July 1 2013 . The South Korea-based electronics . giant, also the world’s biggest TV company, made 27.7 per cent of all . phones sold during the quarter. Apple’s iPhone was said to be . ‘underperforming’ with an estimated operating profit of £3billion . according to research firm Strategy Analytics. In the past, while selling fewer phones, the more expensive iPhone has kept Apple’s profits ahead of competitors’. But with no new products to do battle with Samsung’s latest, the Galaxy S4, Apple finally lost its crown. Neil Shah, of Strategy Analytics, . said: ‘With strong volumes, high wholesale prices and tight cost . controls, Samsung has finally succeeded in becoming the handset . industry’s largest and most profitable vendor.’ Experts say Apple could overtake Samsung again when it launches its next iPhone model. Apple released its most recent handset, the iPhone 5, pictured, in September 2012 whereas Samsung released its flagship Galaxy S4 in March. Since then the Korean firm has also released the Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini in May - both which would have contributed to the company's lead . Budget smartphone maker ZTE, which makes the PF200, pictured, is now the world's fourth largest manufacturer for the first time ever . Both companies storm ahead of other phone makers, including LG, Lenovo and ZTE which had 5.1 per cent share, 4.7 per cent and 4.2 per cent respectively. This is the first time ever that ZTE has taken the fourth spot. Lenovo pushed Huawei from the list. However, some analysts claim this might be because Apple is gearing up for a new release so is experiencing a natural decline. Apple released its most recent handset, the iPhone 5, in September 2012 whereas Samsung released its flagship Galaxy S4 in March this year. Since that time, the Korean firm has also released the Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini in May - both which would have contributed to this rise. Apple is rumoured to be working on an iPhone 5S, due to launch in September, as well as a cheaper, plastic model dubbed iPhone Lite. Figures from uSwitch.com's Mobile Tracker for July found that Apple handsets are still among the bestselling smartphones in the UK. Apple's . iPhone 5 topped the list, followed by the 4S model. Samsung's Galaxy S4 . is the bestselling Android device while Apple's iPhone 4 is in fourth . place and Samsung's other Galaxy handsets occupy fifth, eight, ninth and . tenth place. The HTC One Silver and Sony's Xperia Z complete the top ten in sixth and seventh respectively. Other . figures from Strategy Analystics found that global smartphone shipments . grew 47 per cent annually from 156.5 million units in the second . quarter of 2012 to 229.6 million in Q2 2013. This was the largest volume of smartphones ever shipped in a single quarter.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . We still coming: A wedding picture has become an internet hit after a number of the guests were apparently accidentally invited when the bride-to-be sent out a message to a wrong number . A wedding invitation that was allegedly accidentally sent to a wrong number has become an internet hit after a stranger said he would turn up with his friends. The text conversation, which includes the line 'We still coming', has gone viral after being posted online. As the text gained attention online, a subsequent photograph claiming to be that of the happy couple with their newfound friends also emerged. However it has since emerged the picture was actually a still taken from a music video posted online earlier this month. It is unclear if the text is part of a promotion for said video, is genuine, or is part of a hoax. The whole incident, which is thought to have originated in the U.S, appears to have been started after a bride-to-be called Kristen sent out an invite to her 'BBQ and wedding photos' following her and Roger's marriage ceremony. The message however somehow appears to have gone to a wrong number, who reassures Kristen that despite the fact that they are strangers, 'me and my boys will be there.' Even after Kristen replies with an apology, adding her invite was only for people the couple actually know, the recipient responds with the line: 'We still coming.' The phrase has now become an internet hit after becoming a popular hashtag on Twitter. It has been suggested on some sites, including Reddit, that the wedding took place in Detroit, while other news organisations, including the New York Post, have suggested it was actually due to take place in England. This picture subsequently emerged after the message was posted online, however it has now been pointed out that it was actually part of a music video released earlier this month . Weddings have been providing the internet with a rich source of material recently, such as the elderly man who became an online sensation with his impressive dance moves at a wedding party. The unidentified white-haired man was filmed by Edgard Eleuterio Daza from Peru as he toe-tapped his way through several tracks including Rock Around The Clock and Jailhouse Rock at the event. His jovial moves quickly attracted attention from female admirers and in the video, at the one-minute-50-second mark, he appears with two ladies on his arm.","Bride-to-be called Kristen apparently sent out invite to 'BBQ and wedding photos' which somehow appeared to go to a wrong number .

Police were called the scene - in the 9100 block of Castle Boulevard in Jacksonville - about noon Wednesday after there was a report of an argument and a shooting. Video after the shooting by neighbor Christopher Cash shows the victim slumped in a chair as neighbors rush to help her.

I walked out and just heard a pop,' Cash told WTEV. Witnesses say the two women got into an argument on Facebook Tuesday night.

"By . Harriet Arkell for MailOnline . A bomb squad was forced to blow up a wartime explosive in a field after discovering a cache of guns, ammunition and grenades in a man's garage this morning. Army experts were called to the semi-detached house in St Albans, Hertfordshire, this evening after police sealed off the property having discovered the hoard of historic weaponry. A planned explosion was carried out in a nearby field as a 48-year-old man, named locally as Alan Tissington, was arrested on suspicion of stealing from a prisoner of war camp in the UK. Bomb disposal robots were sent into the home this morning where police found a vast collection of war memorabilia including guns, artillery shells, mortar bombs, gas masks and uniforms from the First and Second World Wars. Scroll down for video . Police who raided a house in a Hertfordshire street found a cache of firearms and ammunition in the garage . After the raid, police laid out some of the firearms and ammunition they had found at the man's house . Arranged against the far wall of the garage housing the memorabilia was a collection of artillery shells . Army experts carried out a controlled explosion in a field near the house this afternoon in St Albans . Hertfordshire Police confirmed a number of detonations were carried out this afternoon in the field . Forensics experts worked to catalogue the munitions they found, which included bullets and rifles . A garage behind the property stored a treasure trove of memorabilia - and munitions - from the world wars . A man, 46, was arrested on suspicion of theft of explosives before bomb disposal robots went into his house . Police and army officers were accompanied by experts from English Heritage as they searched the house, outbuildings and garden. Hertfordshire Police, who insisted the raid was not terrorism-related, said it may be necessary to remain at the house for up to 48 hours as they carry out work to establish the safety of the devices found today. Chief Inspector Ken Townsend, of Hertfordshire Police, said: 'This seizure is on an unprecedented scale and it will be a long process. 'It is an extremely large collection. Although the items seized today are potentially dangerous, there is no danger to members of the public. 'We have all the necessary experts in place to deal safely with the items recovered. The EOD will be carrying out controlled detonations this afternoon. 'This will be heard in the local area, residents need not be alarmed.' Officers suspect the man of illegally metal detecting on sites of historic importance, including a former Second World War PoW camp in Batford, near Harpenden. It is a criminal offence to retrieve artefacts from the ground after finding them with a metal detector if the land is a protected site or without permission of the landowner. The large camp was home to around 600 prisoners of war, most of them Italian or German, until around 1947. Hertfordshire Police said they had intelligence to suggest that the man living at the property with his family had been building up a collection of WW1 and WW2 artefacts. Officers believe the man, who neighbours described as a military enthusiast, had travelled to sites all over Britain and Europe in the search for memorabilia. Hand grenades, shell covers, incendiary bombs, and stick grenades were among the munitions discovered . Dozens of police officers, accompanied by army bomb disposal experts and sniffer dogs filled the street . The garage contained a vast collection of memorabilia including uniforms, gas masks, helmets and wreaths . The firearms were found in a garage to the side of the semi-detached house after today's early morning raid . This Vicker's belt-fed machine gun was among the items seized by police at the house in St Albans today . Explosives found in the raid on the house today were removed by bomb disposal experts to a nearby field . Houses either side of the property were evacuated and residents at two properties behind the man's house were also told they must leave. A police spokeswoman said 'We have found munitions, which are bombs, firearms and ammunition, and the army is here now establishing the safety of everything. 'If it is found to be safe, it will be put in the van and got rid of.' This afternoon a neighbour, 86-year-old Doug Harris, said: 'They are a lovely family and they have helped me in the past. 'I know the family are in shock.' Meanwhile officers opened a community centre on the nearby Jersey Farm Estate for residents moved from their homes. Neighbour Ranjit Yogendra, 66, said the man lived at the house with his wife and two young daughters. After a man was arrested, bomb disposal robots from the Royal Logistics Corps went into the property . Members of the army's bomb disposal team surrounded the property which was raided at around 8am today . He said 'They must have been here around ten years. They are a lovely family. Mother of two Maha Ibrahum, 44, said she found her home sealed off behind the police cordon when she returned home from the school run at 9.30am. 'I'm shocked because it's a nice, quiet area,' she said. June Reid,50, said she drew her curtains open this morning to see the street swarming with army and police officers. She said: 'It is normally really quiet around here but when I saw soldiers, my immediate thought was it was a bomb.' Hertfordshire Police handed out information leaflets to neighbours and warned them that they should prepare to be evacuated at any time if explosives were discovered in the property.

"By . Katy Winter for MailOnline . A couple have lost an incredible 13st together after learning to cook kebabs for the very first time. Katie and Roy Marks, from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, lived on takeaways and microwavable food, but after learning to cook their takeaways at home, they have shed the weight. The pair now cook together every night and are 13st lighter, with Katie, 30, weighed over 22st, but now has dropped to a slender size 12 and 14st, while Roy has gone from 23st to 18st. Scroll down for video . The pair used to live off fast food and have at least two 'blow out' take-away meals a week . Their unhealthy diet saw Katie's weight reach 22st and found her wearing a size 26 . Katie, a children's nanny, said: 'When we wanted to lose weight we didn't know how to cook it was really embarrassing. 'We used to eat takeaways at least twice a week and the other days were microwave meals so it was really hard to learn. 'I remember the first meal was a home-cooked meat kebab and we made our own chips as well. 'We were really surprised it turned out as well as it did and it tasted so lovely. 'We cook everything together now, with the kebabs a firm favourite, and have lost thirteen stone.' Katie and Roy, who used to eat at least two blow out takeaways a week, have kept each other going throughout their weight loss. Katie was prompted to drop from 22st (left) to 14st (right) when she had difficulty conceiving . Mrs Marks said: 'It has been really supportive having Roy there losing weight with me. 'We've always done everything together, but now instead of just sitting and watching a film together, we walk the dogs and cook together too. 'Every Wednesday morning before I go to weigh at my Slimming World class, Roy weighs himself first so we can do it together, and we measure our waists together too. 'We have never been competitive and it is just a massive support going through it side by side.' When the couple married in 2007, Katie walked down the aisle in a size 24 wedding dress but was not bothered about her weight. Katie was told she needed to have a BMI of below 30 in order to qualify for IVF, and now, at 8st less (right) is planning to begin a course and hopefully start a family . Katie said: 'I was happy at the time. 'How I ate and looked was my just my life and what I knew, it didn't affect me at all.' But when the newlyweds decided to start trying for a baby, their weight became a problem. Katie said: 'We were back and forwards to the GP as I struggled to get pregnant. 'The doctor said my weight would be contributing to problems with fertility. Roy lost over 5st by being taught the slimming class lessons by Katie at home when he returned from work . 'I was diagnosed with polycystic ovaries and went on to have four miscarriages and an ectopic pregnancy. 'They said I would never be able to fall pregnant by myself naturally. My only hope was IVF treatment.' But both Katie and Roy were too overweight to have IVF treatment, and their only chance of a baby was too lose weight. Katie said: 'I had to have a BMI under 30, and Roy under 35, but me being a size 26 and Roy an XXXL, we were nowhere near.' Katie and Roy knew what they had to do, and decided to lose the weight to have their dream family. Katie added: 'At first I was too embarrassed to go to classes so I tried to lose the weight at home. 'But over two years I only lost two and a half stone because I didn't know what I was doing. 'I decided enough was enough and joined a Slimming World class. 'Roy works full time so I went to the class and came back to teach him what I had learnt. 'The main thing was to cook everything healthily. 'The first meal we cooked together was Slimming World Kebab meat and we made our own chips as well! Breakfast: None . Snacks: Crisps, Sweets, Chocolate . Lunch: Sandwich with four slices of bread, butter and cheese. About two bags of crisps each . Snacks: King sized bar of chocolate, Sweets, Crisps .

Snacks: Yoghurt, sugar free jelly or fruit . 'We had never cooked before so it was really hard to start learning. 'But soon we realised we both loved cooking - maybe things would have been different if we had known this before. 'In just one year I lost 5st 7lb and now I am a healthy size 12, and Roy lost 5st too. 'Now we cook every night together and walk our dogs together for exercise. 'It's been great going through it together and we motivate each other to keep going. 'We have a completely different lifestyle and eat so much healthier. 'The beauty of Slimming World is no food is forbidden it is just all in moderation, we haven't had to say goodbye to take-aways completely! 'It has worked wonders for us and we have never felt happier.' The couple are now the right weight to undergo IVF treatment and are looking to start their family later this year.

"By . Katy Winter for MailOnline . It might be unbelievable looking at her flawlessly toned body, but Lucy Mecklenburgh claims that her passion for exercise, workout empire and even her latest appearance on gymnastic reality show Tumble, all originated from her cellulite. The 22–year-old shot to fame on The Only Way is Essex, but says it was precisely the lifestyle she was leading on the show- which involved a fair bit of drinking at nightclubs- that gave her the wake up call she needed. Speaking to Women’s Fitness, the star says ‘I didn’t train at all. I was one of those girls who had the gym membership, but never went. And one day I was like, “OK I’m thin, but I’m unfit, I’m unhealthy and I’m starting to get cellulite – I need to do something.”’ Scroll down for video . The 22-year-old says she started to get cellulite from her former TOWIE unhealthy lifestyle . Lucy with trainer and business partner Cecillia Harris who admits she had to create longer workouts to keep up with Lucy's enthusiasm for the training . She began training with personal trainer Cecilia Harris, soon developing a love of exercise which eventually resulted in the pair starting ‘Results With Lucy’ which has now blossomed into a fitness empire. However her enviable figure is the result of some serious dedication, both in the gym and the kitchen. ‘I love core work! I’m a really strange person who loves ab pain!’ she says. Cecilia agrees: ‘If I say, “Lucy what do you want to do: 20 press-ups or hold plank?” she’ll always say plank!’ Cecilia says: ‘I tend to do 30-minute interval-training sessions with all my clients.’ But Lucy wanted more! ‘I started doing 30 minutes, but then I wanted an hour!’ she says. ‘Once you start seeing improvements in your body, you want to do more.’ ‘You can’t out-train a bad diet. Lucy says that as tough as training for BBC's Tumble has been, it has given her a new body confidence . ‘I love eating clean now. I would never ever go back. Obviously I have treats, the same as everyone else: on the weekend I’ll have a dessert if I go out for dinner. But you know when you’ve eaten something bad - when you read the back of processed food packaging and there’s 25 ingredients, you know it’s not going to be good for you. ‘Everything I eat I usually make from scratch. Eating and nutrition are so important, especially if you’re training. ‘I like stir-fries because they’re quick and I’m busy. ‘Quinoa is my new best friend. I have it at breakfast for energy because I train in the mornings. I have quinoa, smoked salmon and scrambled egg. It’s on our EatWell plan.’ But despite now spending a large portion of her time working out, Lucy says that she has found the training for BBC’s Tumble gruelling, but that it has whipped her into her best shape ever and given her a new body confidence . Lucy warns that no matter how much exercise you do, you can't out train a bad diet and need to eat well . Simple exercises, like this plank back-kick, that can be done at home are part of the reason 'Results With Lucy' has become such a sucess . ‘I’m loving the training because I’m getting more definition. I’m using muscles I never knew existed. I like that feeling of feeling strong and I guess it makes me feel more confident,’ Lucy says. The full interview is available in this month's Women's Fitness . ‘I can’t wait to get into a bikini and show off my body after five hours a day of gymnastics training!’ ‘We do four to five hours of training a day – trampolining, floor work and rhythmic gymnastics – and one day a week at circus school. ‘I’ve never sweated so much in my entire life. I’m pouring the whole time,’ she admits. ‘But you do feel yourself getting fitter.’ With the semi-finals for Tumble kicking off next week, the bar was raised on Saturday night’s episode. Despite gaining immense confidence since her first week, Lucy’s seductive ribbon routine failed to impress the judges. The beauty had to face off against John, whose trampoline routine was the lowest-scoring of the night. However Lucy, who looked sexy in a metallic leotard and big bouncy curls, was pleased with her ribbon performance and admitted she’d finally come into her own. ‘I’m actually starting to enjoy to perform. I loved that routine! I am starting to get into the routines and get into character,’ she said . The full interview is available in this month's Women's Fitness magazine out now, for more info go to http://www.womensfitness.co.uk . Lucy demonstrates the perfect technique for a curtsey squat . CURTSEY SQUAT X 30 SECONDS . Start off standing with your feet shoulder-width apart. Step forward and across your leg and sit into a squat pushing the hips back and keeping the chest tall. Keep your upper body facing forward. Return to the start and perform on the other leg. Continue alternating legs to complete set. SAFETY TIP: Don’t let your upper back round . Lunges are a great exercise to improve balance and core strength as well as tone . LUNGE x 30 SECONDS . Start in a standing position then take a large step forward with your left leg. Bend the knee of the left leg as low as you can go, keeping your back leg extended and the foot on the floor. Keep a straight back throughout and your arms out stretched in front. Return to standing and repeat with the other leg. Continue,alternating legs. Holding a weight is a great way to make this exercise more challenging once you are comfortable with it . LEG CRUNCH X 30 SECONDS . Lie flat on your back with your arms stretched above your head (holding a weight is optional). Slowly lift your legs to a 45-degree angle, keeping them straight. Bend your knees and bring your knees toward your chest until your hips are at a 90-degree angle. At the same time bring your arms over your head until your hands are over the centre of your body, lifting your head and shoulders from the floor - you will be in a crunch position. Hold this crunched position, then reverse the movement until you are back in the starting position, lying on the floor. Repeat for 30 seconds.

"By . Charlotte Kemp for the Daily Mail . My mum, Linda, is a lifelong Marks & Spencer clothes shopper. From slacks to sparkly tops, everything she wears is scooped from the rails of this High Street favourite. But I do sometimes wonder if she does it all with her eyes shut. Or maybe, at 68, she’s got used to playing it safe in beige, florals and the occasional sequin. In her defence, shopping in M&S can be a bit of a gamble for anyone — their clothes so often blur the line between frumpy and fashionable. But if Mum would just look beyond the ubiquitous waterfall cardigans and shapeless blouses, there are hidden gems to be found. I decided to show her where I think she’s going wrong and suggested we browse through the new collection and each choose our favourite items. But could I tempt Mum out of her comfort zone? Scroll down for video . Black dress, £49.50 . Shoes, £79Charlotte says: This dress is a showstopping bargain. It looks designer and it gives a curvy shape, but it’s not too tight. What more can you ask for? Mum looks fantastic and it knocks years off her.Linda says: I couldn’t believe this was from Marks & Sparks — boy, did it look risque! I would never, ever have picked this up for myself — it’s far too showy. But, I have to confess I love it. It’s incredibly flattering, and the biggest surprise is how comfortable it is. I feel really glamorous in it — and I can still breathe. Parka coat, £89 . Green blouse, £28 . Long skirt, £45 . Boots, £85Linda says: . This is so me. The anorak could go over absolutely everything I own. I . love the stylish fur trim and the fact it’s so cosy and comfortable. I . chose this because I  like the way it covers my middle.Charlotte says: Can you see why I’ve been trying to persuade mum she’s stuck in a style rut? This outfit is dowdy from top to toe. Cream coat, £249 . Metallic skirt, £149 . Cream top, £29.50 . Court shoes, £79Charlotte says: OK, I admit the skirt’s a bit much, but the coat is hugely stylish and worth the money. Mum looks years younger. Linda says: When I saw this coat, I thought it was a dressing gown. The next shock was the price — £249 is far more than I’d usually spend on an entire outfit, let alone one item. But I admit that it did look — and feel — great. Linen top, £22 . Chinos, £22.50 . Sandals £35Linda says: I’ll live in this blouse. It’s lovely and loose and the colour will go with anything. And the trousers are so comfy. Charlotte says: When Mum goes shopping, she’s magnetically attracted to beige, so I’m not surprised she’s chosen this. I tell her the colour makes her look washed out, but she ignores me. Burgundy top, £35 . Brown trousers, £45 . Court shoes, £79 . Necklace, £19.50Charlotte says: Mum’s convinced herself she needs to wear loose- fitting trousers, but these tailored cigarette pants look terrific. The top is sophisticated and the colour adds warmth.Linda says: Me in a pair of slinky trousers? I never thought I’d see the day at my age, but I can see that they are rather flattering. Crucially, they’re still comfortable, which for me, is a must. Jumper, £21 . Long navy skirt, £45 . Ankle boots, £59Linda says: A skirt like this hides a multitude of sins and I can wear it with shoes or winter boots. The jumper is a neutral colour and the three-quarter length sleeves are flattering. Charlotte says: Sorry mum, but where’s the broomstick? This really is an unflattering combination. The skirt piles pounds on you and the jumper’s just ‘blah’. And as for the boots, there should be a law against anything that ugly. Cardigan, £139 . Silk blouse, £35 . Leopard-print skirt, £35 . Belt, £19.50 . Court shoes, £79Charlotte says: The pencil shape makes Mum look slimmer and the animal print is subtle enough to look stylish without a hint of mutton. Linda says: I’m amazed how different I look. Charlotte’s right. The skirt I chose is shapeless in comparison to this one, and the animal print is trendy. But I’m afraid there’s simply no way I’d wear these shoes. Floral print dress, £39.50 . Shoes, £35Linda says: As a rule, I avoid dresses, but I like this one. The floral pattern’s pretty and it’s not too clingy round the middle. It’s shorter than I prefer,  but the sleeves are a flattering length to hide crepey arms. I’d happily wear this to church or out to lunch.Charlotte says: It’s probably best Mum doesn’t buy too many dresses if this is what she goes for. It ages you Mum. Put it back! Polka dot dress, £49.50 . Belt, £8 . Shoes, £35Charlotte says: No sleeves, knee-length and fitted at the waist — I’m really pushing Mum out of her comfort zone with this, but I think she looks fantastic. The pattern’s understated and the colour is flattering. It looks fun. You’re not past it, Mum! Linda says: I feel self- conscious about my chubby knees and there’s far too much arm on show for my liking. Quick! Someone get me a cardie. Linda says: This has definitely spurred me on to be more adventurous. I didn’t realise how much of a rut I was in. Practically all my togs are from Marks & Sparks — but they’re all the same. It’s time to ditch the beige. I thought the more fitted styles would be uncomfortable, but they weren’t and they were more flattering. Charlotte says: I really hope this is the wake-up call Mum needs. She looks terrific. Instead of always buying the same old florals, she needs to experiment. I bet her friends won’t guess it’s all from M&S.","Mum Linda dresses head to toe in the High street favourite but never picks the stylish option .

"By . Carol Davis . A new hearing aid that's  attached to the head by  magnets has been . life-transforming for drama  teacher and mother-of-four Emma Stothers, . 37, from St Andrews in Fife. Here, she  talks to CAROL DAVIS about the . experience... When I was seven, I was diagnosed . with glue ear in both ears - my ears were filled with fluid, which was . stopping me from hearing properly. I had an operation to insert . grommets - little plastic tubes - to drain  the fluid. They did help, . though my hearing was still poor and I needed extra lessons because it . affected my school work. Drama teacher and mother-of-four Emma Stothers, 37, from St Andrews in Fife has a new hearing aid . And the grommets kept falling out - I had three operations over four years to put them back. As I grew up, going out with friends was difficult. I had to ask people to repeat themselves and noisy places were a nightmare. Over . time, I learned to lip-read. But as a drama teacher, it wasn't easy . because the children don't always speak clearly or look at you when . they're speaking. By 30, I was still struggling. My husband, John, . helped by speaking loudly and repeating things, but we have four boys, . so the house could be incredibly noisy, with me straining to hear and . turning the TV up, and the children shouting to make themselves heard. It seemed to be getting worse - sometimes, I wouldn't hear the phone or doorbell. Once, my three-year-old dialled 999 and I didn't hear the police call back, so they turned up on the doorstep. Emma's hearing implant transmits the sound vibrations through the bone of her skull to the inner ear . I worried my hearing would go completely, or my children would need me and I wouldn't hear. In . 2007, I saw my GP, who referred me to consultant ear, nose and throat . surgeon Stephen Jones - he referred me for a hearing aid in my left ear, . which was worse than the right. Although that helped, I kept getting . ear infections: Mr Jones said the hearing aid made my ear damp and . humid, encouraging bacteria. I kept needing antibiotics and ear drops, so only used the hearing aid while teaching - this did help to reduce the infections. When . I next saw Mr Jones, he said that, in fact, it wasn't the glue ear . causing the hearing problems for all those years; I had otosclerosis. There . are three tiny bones in the middle ear, just behind the ear drum, which . transmit sound vibrations to the inner ear. Otosclerosis is when extra . bone grows around the smallest bone, which means it can't move and pass . on sound vibrations. Mr Jones said it can be linked to raised . oestrogen levels, and could have become worse during pregnancy. He tried . to free the bone surgically, but scar tissue meant he could not . proceed. Mr Jones said I could have a bone-anchored hearing aid - . this would transmit the sound vibrations through the bone of my skull to . the inner ear, instead of via the ear canal. The hearing aid would be . fixed by a screw into my skull. But I wasn't keen, because I'd read they caused infections - and didn't fancy a screw sticking out of my skin. In . 2012, Mr Jones mentioned a new hearing aid implant -  the part of the . device that transmitted the sound vibrations to my inner ear would be . surgically implanted into the bone behind my ear. The external sound . processor and microphone, about the thickness of a £2 coin, would be . held in place behind my ear by a magnet, which would be attracted to the . magnetic end of the implant, so I could remove it to sleep or shower. There was less risk of infection, and I could have it done on the NHS. I . had the hour-long operation in January 2013. Afterwards, the skin . behind my ear was sore and swollen, so I needed painkillers. The . swelling settled down after four weeks. Five weeks after surgery, an . audiologist put the sound processor above my left ear. Suddenly, I heard . doors closing, phones ringing and footsteps - things I'd barely heard . before. Coming home to four lively boys was amazing. I could hear the . tiniest sounds - and correct their pronunciation while  they were . learning to speak.  It's fantastic. Stephen Jones is consultant ear, nose and throat surgeon at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee. ten . million Britons suffer from hearing loss. In many cases it is . age-related, but it can also be caused by wax, glue ear, head injury, . acute ear infections, or conditions such as otosclerosis, thought to . affect 2 per cent  of people. When we hear, soundwaves move through . the ear canal and make the eardrum vibrate. The vibrations are passed . via three tiny, linked bones in the middle ear to the inner ear, where . they are converted to nerve impulses which are carried to the brain. With otosclerosis, the smallest of the three bones, shaped like a stirrup, becomes fixed and cannot vibrate. As . a result, patients often can't hear anything under 60 decibels, such as . normal conversation. Normal hearing detects sounds from under 20 . decibels. Hearing aids help, but can lead to ear infections. With . otosclerosis, we can remove part of the fixed bone and replace it with . an artificial link so that it moves again.  This is usually successful . but,  in Emma's case, scar tissue prevented us from doing this. She was diagnosed with glue ear in both ears as a child. They were filled with fluid, stopping her hearing . Another option for hearing loss caused by a blockage or an abnormality in the ear is a bone-anchored hearing aid. Normally, . sound is transmitted through the middle ear to the inner ear - but it . can also be transmitted through bone. With a bone-anchored hearing aid, . an external sound processor is fixed onto a titanium screw implanted . into the bone behind the ear. These work in the vast majority of . cases, though a few get infections that can mean skin grows over the . head of the screw so the sound processor can't stay in place. Some . people find the screw unattractive, and don't like being able to feel . it. The new Bonebridge device is attached with a magnet instead - an . external sound processor transmits sound to a 4-5cm to 5cm implant under . the skin, which vibrates and sends the sound to the inner ear. This . could help people who cannot wear hearing aids, usually because of ear . infections, or people born without an ear canal - but it won't help . people with severe hearing loss because their level of hearing loss is . too extreme. The operation carries standard risks of bleeding and . infection and a small risk of puncturing the dura (the thick membrane . surrounding the brain), which could cause a leak of cerebrospinal fluid. This would need to be repaired, as it could  cause meningitis. The percentage of people with hearing aids who don't wear them regularly . Depending . on whether there is enough space in the mastoid bone, behind the ear, . to embed the implant, or whether we have to find a different site behind . a vein behind the ear, The operation takes 45 to 90 minutes under . general anaesthetic. I make a 5cm incision and peel back the skin . and muscle to expose the bone. I then drill a well in the bone for the . implant and screw it in place. The incision is stitched. Once the . incision has healed, at least three weeks later, the patient sees an . audiologist to put the sound processor in place and switch it on. The . implant stays in place indefinitely; the patient changes the batteries . in the external sound processor when needed. After around seven years, . the processor will probably  need replacing, as tiny parts wear out and . newer models  are developed. Patients should have many years of good hearing. ANY DRAWBACKS? 'This . operation carries a small risk of bleeding and infection or of the . implant failing so it needs to be taken out,' says Kevin Green, . consultant ear, nose and throat surgeon at Manchester Royal Infirmary. 'Drilling into the mastoid bone carries a theoretical risk of damage to the membrane covering the brain. 'We . don't know how Bonebridge will perform long term, but we expect it to . last for years. For the right patient, it works well and can restore . hearing after years of hearing loss.' The operation costs £12,000 to £15,000 privately and is a similar cost to the NHS.","Mother-of-four Emma Stothers, 37, from St Andrews has a new hearing aid .

So that means that she went from experiencing minimal pain, to extreme pain with little time to adjust. When my dad was driving her to the hospital, he unfortunately had to stop for gas. He went into pay, and just then an elderly man in a wheelchair stopped him, asking him to buy cigarettes for him as the store was not wheelchair accessible.

"By . Wills Robinson for MailOnline . Historians have spent years debating whether Stonehenge was once a complete circle. Despite numerous tests and excavations, the mystery remained unsolved for almost 5,000 years. But staff at the neolithic site believe the question has finally been answered - all because a hosepipe was too short. Scroll down for video . Completing the picture: English Heritage believe the discovery has finally revealed the location of missing sarsen stones which once completed the Neolithic Stonehenge - here is what they believe it would have looked like . The mystery as to whether Stonehenge was round has been solved while the ground was being watered. A short hosepipe meant they could not reach the area where there is a gap in the outer circle. The ground then became parched and revealed where stones that have been missing for years once are believed to have once stood . The hosepipe, which would have been stretched to the prehistoric ring of stones from the top right hand corner, could not reach the bottom left of the circle where there is a gap in the stones. It meant the grass was dry and revealed what are thought to be 'stone holes' Every summer stewards at the ancient monument in Wiltshire water the site to keep the grass healthy and green and the earth well nourished. But this year the hosepipe was not log enough and failed to reach the outer part of the circle - where no stones stand. The dried out land, which couldn't be reached, revealed marks of parched grass which were spotted by a volunteer who alerted experts. English Heritage believe the discovery has finally revealed the location of missing sarsen stones which once completed the Neolithic circle. Susan Greaney, from English Heritage, said: 'It's really significant, and it shows us just how much we still have to learn about Stonehenge. 'A lot of people assume we've excavated the entire site and everything we're ever going to know about the monument is known. But actually there's quite a lot we still don't know and there's quite a lot that can be discovered just through non-excavation methods. 'It's great that people who know the site really well and look at it every day were able to spot these parch marks and recognise them for what they were. We maintain the grass with watering when it's very dry in the summer, but our hosepipe doesn't reach to the other side of the stone circle.

Every summer stewards at the ancient monument water the site in Wiltshire to keep the grass healthy and green and the earth well nourished .

Staff only water the site during the driest weeks of summer, but the hosepipe doesn't reach to the south-west quadrant where there is a gap in the circle. Worker Tim Daw spotted the patches on the ground - now thought to be 'stone holes' - where the grass was more parched. He said: 'I was standing on the public path looking at the grass near the stones and thinking that we needed to find a longer hosepipe to get the parched patches to green up. 'A sudden light-bulb moment in my head, and I remembered that the marks were where archaeologists had looked without success for signs that there had been stone holes, and that parch marks can signify them. 'I called my colleague over and he saw them and realised their possible significance as well. Not being archaeologists we called in the professionals to evaluate them. 'I am still amazed and very pleased that simply really looking at something, that tens of thousands of people had unwittingly seen, can reveal secrets that sophisticated machinery can't.'

"By . Rob Davies for the Daily Mail . Millions of cat allergy sufferers know the symptoms only too well – red, itchy eyes, uncontrollable sneezes, coughing fits, even a nasty rash. But help could soon be at hand thanks to a British company working on a vaccine it says can render even the fluffiest feline totally harmless. Sheffield-based Benchmark says its revolutionary injection can ‘neutralise’ the cat itself, rather than forcing humans to resort to costly treatments that often have limited effect. A British company is working on a vaccine which it says can render even the fluffiest feline totally harmless to allergy sufferers . It works by attacking a protein carried in cats’ saliva, urine and sweat that is the most common cause of cat allergies. More than 725m people, about a tenth of the global population, are thought to be allergic to cats but options for alleviating the symptoms are limited. Sufferers can take anti-histamines or have regular injections designed to stimulate the body’s natural immune system. Some websites recommend using air purifiers or even bathing your cat as often as possible, which can prove difficult if the animal doesn’t cooperate. The new vaccine, dubbed HypoCat, works by attacking the Fel d 1 protein, the main allergen carried by cats and kittens. Fel d 1, present in saliva, urine and sweat, is spread all over the cat’s fur when it licks itself clean. The protein then attaches itself to cat dander, tiny particles of dry skin one tenth the size of a dust mite. As cats prowl their territory, they leave dander on surfaces such as bedding and sofas, wreaking havoc on allergy sufferers whose symptoms are triggered by the protein. But Benchmark claims that HypoCat can ‘neutralise’ the Fel d 1 protein altogether, without harming the cat. It is spending up to £8million to commercialise research by Swiss firm HypoPet, based at the University of Zurich, in the hope of making HypoCat available through vets within three or four years. Maureen Jenkins, clinical director of Allergy UK, said the vaccine could make a huge difference to allergy suffereds in the UK, which hosts an army of around 8.5million cats. ‘It’s a major problem in this country so this could be very significant,’ she said. ‘Some people avoid cats like the plague and when they are then exposed they could have a very serious reaction.’ ‘It’s also something that can cause chronic ongoing systems and a lot of people don’t realise what the cause is.’ Benchmark said it believes that HypoCat could open up a new market for cat vaccinations worth as much as £250million. Life sciences analysts at City of London firm Cenkos Securities said: ‘There is a large potential market for this vaccine.’ ‘We believe that this approach will lead to a relatively straightforward solution for cat owners and the population that suffers from cat allergies,’ they added.","Sheffield-based Benchmark says its injection can ‘neutralise’ cat itself .

"By . Mark Prigg . Sony has been fined £250,000 by the data watchdog for a breach that compromised the personal information of 77 million PlayStation users. The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) issued the penalty after it found the attack on the Sony PlayStation Network in April 2011 could have been prevented. Personal information including customers’ payment card details, names, addresses, email addresses, dates of birth and account passwords were exposed. The firm was fined by the British Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) after it found the attack on the Sony PlayStation Network in April 2011 could have been prevented. Here, a user tries a 3D headset for the console. Sony said it believed hackers have obtained the following details from its PlayStation Network users: . It led to millions having to be issued with new bank cards, and around 3 million British users were believed to have been affected. David Smith, ICO deputy commissioner and director of data protection, said: 'If you are responsible for so many payment card details and log-in details, then keeping that personal data secure has to be your priority.' It said the attack could have been prevented if software had been up to date, while passwords were also not secure. 'In this case that just didn’t happen, and when the database was targeted - albeit in a determined criminal attack - the security measures in place were simply not good enough. 'There’s no disguising that this is a business that should have known better. 'It is a company that trades on its technical expertise, and there’s no doubt in my mind that they had access to both the technical knowledge and the resources to keep this information safe.' Smith called the case 'one of the most serious ever reported' to the data regulator. The ICO added that following the breach, Sony rebuilt its Network Platform to ensure that the personal information it processes is kept secure. The attack affected 77 million users of Sony's online Playstation Network, which lets players compete online and download content . Sony temporarily shut down its network, a system that links gamers worldwide in live play, after discovering the massive security breach. The company said at the time that personal data from 77 million users of Sony’s PlayStation network had been compromised. Users were all asked to change their passwords following the breach. The the firm hit out at the ruling. 'Sony Computer Entertainment Europe strongly disagrees with the ICO’s ruling and is planning an appeal,' a spokesman said. 'Criminal attacks on electronic networks are a real and growing aspect of 21st century life and Sony continually works to strengthen our systems, building in multiple layers of defence and working to make our networks safe, secure and resilient. 'The reliability of our network services and the security of our consumers’ information are of the utmost importance to us, and we are appreciative that our network services are used by even more people around the world today than at the time of the criminal attack.' The firm faced heavy criticism over its handling of the network intrusion, as it did not notify consumers of the breach until a week after it began investigating unusual activity. Experts say the move should act as a 'massive wake-up call' for consumers. Alex Simmons, UK Editor-in-Chief, IGN.com said: 'When hackers took PlayStation Network down in April 2011, gamers were critical over the lack of information from Sony – first when they realised they couldn’t play online or download new games on their PlayStation, and when Sony revealed much later on that personal data was potentially compromised. 'IGN readers told us their trust for PlayStation Network was severely dented by the issue, and many gamers even said they would switch to other consoles. 'The whole matter has been a massive wake-up call for consumers to better protect their personal information online because everyone is a potential target.'","Breach compromised the personal information of 77 million users of Sony's online PlayStation Network, and was described as 'one of the most serious ever reported'

"By . Mark Prigg for MailOnline . Apple is preparing to launch a huge 12.9inch tablet to go alongside its new, larger iPhone 6 handsets. Apple Inc's suppliers are preparing to manufacture the company’s largest-ever iPad, according to Bloomberg. It claims 'people with knowledge of the matter' say production is scheduled to commence by the first quarter of next year. Scroll down for video . Apple currently produces iPads with 9.7-inch and 7.9-inch displays - but a new 12.9inch version is believed to be in the works. Here, Apple boss Tim Cook introduces an earlier iPad. Google’s Android mobile operating system became the top tablet operating system last year, with 62 percent of the market, according to researcher Gartner Inc. IPads that use Apple’s iOS mobile software had a 36 percent market share at the end of 2013, down from 53 percent a year earlier, according to the researcher. The new iPad will have a screen measuring 12.9 inches diagonally, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the details aren’t public. Apple currently produces iPads with 9.7-inch and 7.9-inch displays. Apple is also increasing the screen size of the iPhone. It is believed the company is holding an event on Sept. 9 to debut new bigger-display iPhones . The iPhones will come in two new models: one with a 4.7-inch screen and another with a 5.5-inch screen. Apple is hoping to boost iPad sales with its new range, after they slumped 9 per cent in the last quarter. The iPhone maker reported sales of $37.4 billion (£21.9 billion) in its third quarter ending June, falling short of expectations for about $38 billion (£22.3 billion). The Cupertino-based company also revealed that only 13.2 million iPads were sold in the last quarter, compared to 16.3 million in the previous quarter. Apple is hoping to boost iPad sales with its new range, after they slumped 9 per cent in the last quarter. The results have triggered fears that iPad sales are set to get worse once Apple launches its rumoured, large-screen iPhone this autumn. Jitesh Ubrani, an analyst at researcher IDC, said while tablet sales growth has slowed, he projects businesses, schools and governments will become bigger buyers of the devices. Those groups accounted for 16 percent of tablet sales in the second quarter this year, up from 13 percent a year earlier, he estimated. 'We’re expecting larger tablets to do better' in the enterprise market, Ubrani said in an interview. Reports claim Apple suppliers have begun manufacturing the new range of iPads ahead of an October launch. And sources believe the devices will have anti-reflective laminated displays to make it easier to use in bright light, and outside - compared to current, reflective models.","Larger iPad set to go on sale next year .

"By . Corey Charlton for MailOnline . A frog with no croak and the world’s biggest lizard are among the top 10 reptiles and amphibians avoiding extinction with the help of zoos, a report has said. The British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums (BIAZA) has published the list of reptile and amphibian species benefiting from conservation efforts by zoos in the UK and Ireland. They include the axolotl, a critically endangered amphibian which retains its tadpole like appearance as an adult and has an extraordinary ability to regenerate limbs, and the golden mantella, a bright yellow frog which attracts a mate with clicks not croaks. The axolotl, also known as the Mexican salamander, has the ability to regenerate limbs . A frog called the golden mantilla is among the top 10 reptiles and amphibians avoiding extinction . The mountain chicken frog, native to the Caribbean, can grow up to 21cm in size . Lemur leaf frogs, a highly endangered species from Central America, are also being saved with the help of zoos . Also on the list is the Komodo dragon, with less than 1,000 left in the wild, and the mountain chicken, the world’s biggest frog which got its name as it is commonly hunted for food. One of the most sought after reptiles in the illegal pet trade, the ploughshare tortoise, also makes the list as does a UK species, the sand lizard. Dr Andrew Marshall, of BIAZA’s field programmes committee, said: 'Zoos are part of a global conservation community. 'Last year, BIAZA published a report of the top 10 mammals most reliant on zoos, which highlighted the work being done by zoos to help safeguard their future. 'This year, we have focused on 10 prevailing examples of reptiles and amphibians that zoos are working to save from extinction. The list includes some fantastic species, many of which are facing a dramatic decline and are in a desperate situation in the wild.' TV presenter and naturalist Nick Baker, who is backing this year’s top 10 campaign to raise awareness of the species, said: 'Zoos and aquariums have a very important role in this whole thing - at the scariest level they are the Ark. The komodo dragon, from Indonesia, is the largest living species of lizard and can grow up to three metres .

"By . Marielle Simon for Daily Mail Australia . Researchers have called for volunteers to help count penguins in the Antarctic from the comfort of their own home using thousands of photographs to identify adults, chicks and eggs. The call has been placed by the Australian Antarctic Division (ADD), based in Hobart, to assist researchers at Oxford University in the UK to understand behaviour patterns, breeding and the effect predators have on penguins. Volunteer counters will be studying images captured by 40 cameras spread across three regions of East Antarctica - from Mawson's station to Commonwealth Bay. Researchers ultimately hope this process will help develop an algorithm to teach computers how to automatically count penguins, the ABC reports. Scroll down for video . Thousands of online photographs have been scanned by researchers for volunteer counters to assist in identifying adults, chickens and eggs . The 200,000 photographs, many taken by AAD, will be used to explain how human activity and environmental changes impact penguins, so early warning signs can be identified and researchers can help prevent problems from arising. Colin Southwell from AAD hopes the research will also  explain the impact of fisheries on a mass scale. 'What it's about is trying to use the interest of a large number of people out there through online communications to contribute to scientific research,' Dr Southwell said. Images have been captured by researchers using 40 cameras spread across three regions of East  Antarctica - from Mawson's station to Commonwealth bay . He said researchers are looking for non-scientists who are interested in science and penguins to contribute to the study. 'Most people are interested in Antarctica. Most people are interested in penguins, and it's fun.' Volunteer Jenni Klaus told the ABC she came across the study on Twitter. She said although she never studied science she has always been interested. 'There are adorable chicks in some of the photos and you can never get too tired of looking at penguins,' she said.

"Now the trend is being examined in a . new documentary, Hot Tub Britain . By . Kathryn Knight For The Daily Mail . and Helen Carroll for the Daily Mail . Eva and Anthony Ainscoe are looking forward to the onset of winter. ‘In the evening you pour yourself a glass of wine and sit looking up at the stars all lovely and warm. What could be nicer?’ says Anthony. Come again? After all, the Ainscoes live near Chorley, Lancashire, which is not known for its year-round sunshine. Well, earlier this year, retired property developer Anthony, 61, and Eva, 59, splashed out £7,000 on a top-of-the-range six-seater hot tub for their beautifully manicured garden. Scroll down for video . Julian and Tracey Dowler installed a £5,000 outdoor whirlpool at their immaculate three-bedroom semi near Rugby, Warwickshire, in 2008 after wedding fair organiser Tracey, 42, experienced 'hot tub envy' They’ve taken full advantage of it in the summer — with five grandchildren, aged from six months to five — and are convinced it will come into its own once the temperature plunges. ‘I’ve been in it in the rain and it’s beautiful. Now I’m looking forward to a nice snowfall and sitting there with a drink, looking out over the countryside,’ says Anthony. And Anthony and Eva are far from alone. For Britain, it seems, has gone hot tub crazy. As many as one in ten homeowners have one, with spas bubbling away everywhere from humble patios to the lawns of sprawling stately homes. Now the trend is being examined in a new documentary, Hot Tub Britain. It focuses on Britain’s main outdoor retailer, the Hot Tubs Superstore in Blackpool. Superstore founder Dennis Holmes says he’s on course to sell 2,000 tubs this year, with £50,000 worth of sales on peak days. Prices start at just over £3,000 for a basic model, rising to £20,000 for a 16ft ‘swim spa’ with its own current. The 57-year-old set up the business in 2003 following several years working in the U.S., where hot tubs have been popular for years. Mr Holmes says: ‘Hot tubs were big over in the States years ago and I sensed one day they’ll take off in the UK. If your garden isn’t big enough for a swimming pool, then a hot tub is the next best thing. And I was right.’ The surge in popularity, he believes, is down to a change in lifestyle here. ‘Today a lot of people want a more glamorous life and this is a relatively cost-effective way of getting one,’ he says. But despite its growing popularity, the hot tub is still looked upon with a certain degree of snobbery. No wonder the Superstore’s sales director  Ross Phillipson — Dennis’s son-in-law — is keen to revamp their image. The Sturgeon family in their garden hot tub at home in Blackpool, Lancashire. Mother Rachel, father Damien with daughter Gracie,8, and son Leon, 13 . He says: ‘The biggest misconception is that hot tubs are the preserve of swingers, indulgent Premiership footballers or flashy types who live in Essex. In fact, they are bought by anyone and everyone. We recently sold one to a lovely couple in their 80s. ‘Another couple in their 70s made a purchase because they go rambling in the Lake District and enjoy a good soak after walking. ‘The only thing typical of each owner is that they have their own home and are over 25.’ Rachel Sturgeon, 34, says she couldn’t live without the hot tub in her compact garden. The stay-at-home mum  and her engineer husband Damian, 37, had an  eight-seater spa installed at their home in Blackpool eight years ago — much to the delight of their children Leon, 12, and Gracie, eight. ‘Damian and I are home birds, we don’t go out. Instead we like to spend time as a family,’ says Rachel. ‘Where nicer to do it than in bubbly hot water? ‘I recommend everyone to get one. These days they’re cheaper than some fridges — and you don’t need a huge garden.’ What you do need is a firm, level base to put it on — preferably wood or concrete rather than lawn, as bare feet covered in soil and grass will make the water dirty, and an outdoor power socket.Management consultant Sally Dickerson, 53, is also a convert. A divorcee, she divides her time between homes in London, the Cotswolds and latterly Pembrokeshire, where she’s bought Globe House, a five-bedroom Victorian mansion in Angle, which she uses as a holiday home and holiday let. ‘I loved the property as soon as I saw it and then, tucked away in a corner of the garden, I saw an  eight-seater hot tub,’ she says. ‘It was a bit of a surprise, but once I got over the shock, I loved it.’ They’re not always stress-free, however. When 42-year-old Simon Parton ordered a £5,000 tub online earlier this year, after pressure from wife Tracey, 41, and their children Ben, 17, Courtney, 14, and ten-year-old Abigail, delivery men couldn’t get it into his Birmingham garden. Mr Parton, a fireman, says: ‘I measured up and was sure we could get it down the side of our house.’ But he failed to account for pipes and a gas meter. When the tub ended up stuck halfway down a side alley, he had to hire a crane for £300 to winch it into place. It was worth it — the family have used the tub almost daily since, and he says a lot of his colleagues want one as well. So, could keeping up with the Joneses have helped fuel the hot tub bonanza? Julian and Tracey Dowler make no denial of their motivation for  buying one. They installed a £5,000 outdoor whirlpool at their immaculate three-bedroom semi near Rugby, Warwickshire, in 2008 after wedding fair organiser Tracey, 42, experienced ‘hot tub envy’. She says: ‘We’d stayed with one of Julian’s colleagues for the weekend and they had a tub. We all climbed in together and cracked open the champagne. It was lovely, but I felt a bit jealous.’ The Dowlers have a racy streak: they go au naturel in their tub — thankfully, their garden is not overlooked — stripping off and climbing in most nights after dinner. The Dowlers go au naturel in their tub - thankfully, their garden is not overlooked - stripping off and climbing in most nights after dinner . ‘We’ve got some nice lighting and heat lamps out there and Julian built a lovely African-style wooden hut around it, so it’s very relaxing,’ says Tracey. All this fun doesn’t exactly come cheap. The most basic model at Hot Tubs Superstore  — the Rio — costs £3,293, though most Hot Tubs Superstore customers spend between £4,000 and £8,000.Then there’s the upkeep. Tubs are much cheaper to operate these days by keeping them warm, which is more cost effective. This costs around a pound a day, or £30 a month, for an average household. You also have to buy chlorine and other chemicals to keep them sanitised, which can cost £30 a year, while new water filters every year or 18 months cost £25. A family running a tub all year round would spend £400. But Anthony Ainscoe believes the cost of his tub was well worth it. ‘Watching the grand- children splashing around is lovely,’ he says. A word of warning: Keeping tubs meticulously maintained is essential to avoid them harbouring harmful bacteria, according to Professor Nigel Brown, president of the Society for General Microbiology. The water in hot tubs is kept at between 30c and 35c, close to body temperature, and it’s the ideal environment for Legionella bacteria, which causes the potentially fatal lung infection Legionnaires’ disease to flourish. ‘Bacteria grows quickly and if there are any bodily fluids in the tub, such as urine or spittle, it  provides nutrients,’ he says. ‘The bubbles from the tub also generate droplets which, when breathed in, can spread Legionella. So you need to keep them very clean. It’s important to drain and refill hot tubs every few months.’ There are other less deadly risks, too, with inadequately sanitised hot tubs causing skin rashes and boils. These slightly gruesome facts are, of course, unlikely to deter the growing army of outdoor tub fans.Like it or not, they are fast becoming a feature of the British garden.","As many as one in ten homeowners have a hot tub installed in their garden .

"By . Steve Hopkins for MailOnline . Britain is set to bask in several days of warm weather as temperatures in September continue to sizzle well above the national average. While temperatures are expected to hover between 24-25C (75-77F) today, they may hit 27C (80F) tomorrow in the south east, but will at least reach 26C (78F). According to Met Office statistics, that's 7C (44F) higher than the September average of 17.9C (64.2F). Scroll down for video .

While the skies were relatively cloudy today, the temperatures were still in their mid-20s, which saw a lucky few sitting in the sun at Sidmouth, Devon . While temperatures are expected to reach 26C (78F) tomorrow and remain steady throughout the weekend, forecasters said it would remain cloudy and there would be some brief, but heavy, downpours . Met Office spokesman Dan Williams said: '26C is fairly well above average for this time of year.' Mr Williams said temperatures could reach 26C on Friday and would remain around 24-25C throughout the weekend, but over the next two days there would be 'quite a lot of clouds around... it is not wall to wall sunshine'. He said those daring to sunbathe should also expect brief, but heavy, downpours on Thursday and Friday, especially in the south west. It has been predicted that the sunny weather will boost the turnout for tomorrow's Scottish independence referendum. Mr Williams said the sunny spell was caused by a low pressure system off the north-western tip of Spain which was pulling air across the continent. The showers were due to the moisture being absorbed along the way. A woman finds a sunny spot to recline and use her computer on Brighton Beach . A man takes a post-lunch nap on the grass in London as September temperatures continue to sizzle . A woman tops-up her tan on Brighton Beach yesterday, wearing nothing but her bikini bottoms . Mr Williams said it was too early to predict what the weather would do for the remainder of the month, but said temperatures should remain steady into next week, although they would vary across the country. Mr Williams said: 'We will probably see a north-south split, with unsettled weather in the north, while the south will cling to more dry spells.' Sunny September is also on record to become one of the driest ever recorded. Figures up to Monday show there had been 6.7mm of rain across the UK - just seven per cent of the September average of 96mm. The Met Office said they would normally expect about half of the average monthly rainfall to have fallen by this point in the month. A man reclines against a wall and catches some rays of sunshine on Bournemouth's Boscombe beach . It said the figures make it the driest first half of September for the UK since 1960. It’s also the driest start to September for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, but not for England – 1997 and 2003 were drier - the Met Office said. By individual country, Wales was the driest with less than 1mm of rain up until Monday, followed by Northern Ireland which had 1.2mm. England received 4.1mm and Scotland 13.5mm. The average temperature for the UK this month, until the 15th, has been 13.9C (57F), which is 1.3C (34F) above the full-month average. Day-time maximums have averaged 18.4C (65F) which is 1.9C (35F) higher than normal. Night-time minimums have been closer to average at 9.6C (49F), which is 0.7C (33F) above average. Sunshine has also been slightly above normal with 70.8 hours for the UK - about 57 per cent of the full-month average. The figures have come about after a prolonged spell of settled and fine weather, dominated by high pressure sitting over the UK, forecasters said.","Temperatures across the UK are hovering at 6C over the national average .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Carol Driver for MailOnline . A family’s tent was lifted ten feet off the ground and carried 30 feet across a campsite by a mini-tornado – with three children still inside it. Their terrified parents watched as the tent flew across a field in the Lake District leaving a trail of clothes and furniture before crashing against a fence. Steve Gardner, 42, and his wife Gail, 41, rushed over to find the shell-shocked youngsters – Oliver, ten, Kate, eight, and Lily, two – lying battered and bruised. Recovering: Two-year-old Lily, pictured in hospital, left, and recovering, right, suffered a black eye and a bleed on the brain in the incident . 'He was in total shock': The Gardner's eldest child Oliver is treated by paramedics at the campsite in Cumbria . No one was seriously injured, though Kate had to be kept in hospital for 24 hours and Lily had to be monitored for suspected bleeding on the brain. She was released from hospital three days later. The children had been asleep and their parents were just outside the eight-man tent when the twister struck. The family were on a week-long holiday in the dramatic Langdale valley where Mr and Mrs Gardner had spent a sleepless night battling to secure their tent as the tail end of Hurricane Bertha swept through. At 7am the wind appeared to die down enough for the couple to venture out and put the kettle on. Steve Gardner, wife Gail and their children were injured when the tail end of Hurricane Bertha tore through the Cumbria campside where they were on holiday . Mr Gardner, from Whitley Bay, Tyne and Wear, said: ‘Suddenly Gail said she saw this thing coming down the hill, she said a line of trees were going crazy but everything else around it was perfectly still. 'The next thing I knew it just picked up the tent. The entire tent spun over itself high in the air, unbelievably fast, it blew around 30 feet before the lower section crashed into a barbed wire fence. 'The half still in the air ripped free and was just twisting in the air, spilling tables, a camping wardrobe, fleeces and beds as it went.’ The frantic couple ran over and began to search the mess for their children. Tornado terror: Steve and Gail with their children Oliver, 10, Kate, 8, and Lily, 2, were injured when the 'tornado' tore through the  campside . Damaged: The family's neighbouring tent was also pulled apart the night before the hurricane hit . Mr Gardner said: ‘It was a complete twisted wreck, almost like a plane crash, with our things lying everywhere. ‘It was completely silent, the wind had just stopped and I was just listening for the children. I honestly thought they were dead. ‘Oliver was upside down and his face was white and his mouth covered in blood, he was just staring and mouthing something, I thought he was paralysed. ‘After untwisting more material we found Kate. Her eyes were open but she didn’t seem to be conscious, it was horrendous. Hurt: Lily, 2, pictured in hospital, was left bruised after the tent she was sleeping in was blown away . The travel cot in which Lily, 2, was sleeping when the hurricane lifted the Gardner's tent 10ft off the ground . Injured: The Gardner's youngest child, Lily, 2, was taken to hospital with a suspected bleed on the brain . 'Once we had found those two we heard crying from further inside and found Lily in her cot. She was looking round terrified, one eye was shut with blood around it.’ The family were taken to Lancaster Hospital where Oliver was found to be bruised but had avoided any breaks. Kate was kept under observation for 24 hours with concussion. Doctors feared Lily had bleeding on the brain and she was kept in hospital for three days. Mr Gardner added: ‘It was a frightening ordeal. The power of the weather is quite incredible.’","Steve and Gail Gardner were camping with their three children in Cumbria .

The slinky, long-necked blonde, who is signed to Wilhelmina models, sashayed down the runway for yesterday's Richard Chai show at the Lincoln Center, looking very much at home. And well she should, given her impressive lineage. Ella's father Marlon Richards, son of Keith, is a photographer and graphic artist, and her mother is Lucie de la Falaise; a former model and niece of legendary Yves Saint Laurent muse Loulou de la Falaise. Debut: 18-year-old Ella Richards, who is signed with Storm, made her first steps onto the New York Fashion Week circuit yesterday when she appeared in the Richard Chai show at the Lincoln Center . Ella is based in London, having been educated at an English boarding school. The 5ft 9in model has slowly been creeping into the fashion spotlight over the last year, having recently appeared in the Tom Ford fall/winter 2014 campaign. In the past, Ella has declared her 'family members' as being her style icons, with a fondness for the bohemian aesthetic. Her father, born to two then-heroin addicted parents; Keith and Anita Pallenberg, was raised on the Rolling Stones tour bus. Her mother Lucie graced multiple Vogue covers in 90s, and their inner circle of close family and friends include Johnny Depp, Liv Tyler, and cousins Theodora and Alexandra Richards.

The video shows Jack Sanderson, 21, overtaking two other motorcyclists on a narrow road before coming off on a bend, speeding in front of a car, hitting a wall, and plunging 40ft down a cliff. The footage was viewed 1.2million times on YouTube, but after it was sent to police, Sanderson, from Knutsford, Cheshire, was arrested and has now been banned from driving for two years. Scroll down for video . Jack Sanderson, 21, who posted footage of himself crashing his motorbike into a wall before tumbling 40ft down a cliff online has been banned from driving for two years . In the video, which got more than 1.2million hits on YouTube, Sanderson loses control on a bend, narrowly avoids hitting a car, flips over a wall and falls down a cliff but escapes uninjured . He was also given a 12 week jail term suspended for 12 months, ordered to complete 300 hours unpaid work and told to pay a total of £1983.80, including compensation for damaging the wall. Officers traced the owner of the Honda Accord, seen swerving to avoid Sanderson in the video, who told Macclesfield Magistrates Court that he now suffers flashbacks from the incident. Passing sentence, JP Julia Cawson told him: 'The manner of your driving on a notorious road can only be described as both dangerous and breathtakingly thoughtless. 'It was a matter of seconds that was the difference between what occurred and a potential fatality. 'During the trial you showed little acceptance that the manner of your riding was in any way unacceptable. We are glad that you are now able to admit culpability.' Earlier prosecutor Miss Kate Marchuk said: 'Police first became aware when Mr Sanderson went to Macclesfield District Hospital where staff made note to the police that the defendant was bragging about being involved in a road traffic accident. Police were alerted to the footage and managed to trace both Sanderson and Mr Shapiro, the driver of the car in the clip, who said he suffers flashbacks from the accident . Sanderson was also given a 12 week jail term suspended for 12 months, ordered to complete 300 hours unpaid work and told to pay a total of £1983.80 . 'Two anonymous calls were also made to the police saying he had posted footage showing him riding a bike on the Cat and Fiddle Road where he had a near miss with a car. The footage was described by the caller as dangerous. 'The footage was viewed via YouTube. He was riding his motorbike along the A537 Buxton New Road from Macclesfield toward the Cat and Fiddle. 'The footage does show Mr Sanderson overtaking on two occasions into the bend into the passage of cars on the other carriage way. 'He is then seen to crash through a wood fence and dry stone wall and seen falling 40ft. 'From that YouTube footage the police were able to locate the Honda Accord of a Mr Shapiro and his wife. Mr Shapiro was spoken to and said he was to travelling with his wife who was a front seat passenger and was confronted with a motorbike travelling too fast, trying to negotiate a tight bend. 'Me Shapiro then stopped as soon as he could and ended up in the opposite side of the road. He walked back to where the collision happened and by that point Mr Sanderson had already got back on the road. 'Mr Shapiro suffers flashbacks of motorbike approaching him.' Sanderson later told police he was an experienced rider and said he was very competent and had ridden that road previously, but admitted he had never read the Highway Code. Sanderson claimed that he had posted the footage to inform people of the dangers of driving on country roads, but medics at the hospital he was taken to afterwards recalled him bragging about the crash . In mitigation John Richards said: 'The young man is extremely frightened at the prospect of him going into custody. He did say ""if I go I do deserve it."" 'Sometimes the arrogance of youth goes with age and sometimes something like his knocks it out of you. He is very lucky not to have been killed or anyone else.' 'He stuck it on Facebook and it ended up on YouTube. He said at the time he put it up as public service to stop people making the same mistake as he did.' The A537 Cat and Fiddle Road between Macclesfield, Cheshire, and Buxton, Derbyshire, has been repeatedly been branded Britain’s most dangerous due its severe bends and steep drops.","Jack Sanderson, 21, lost control of bike on Cat and Fiddle road, Cheshire .

Police investigate an abandoned BMW on Tuesday after a body was found in the trunk. The medical examiner was confirming whether it was Miss Gonzalez who vanished last week . Investigators in hazmat suits removed the body. The medical examiner is currently working to determine whether the body is that of the 28-year-old bartender, Miami police told MailOnline today. A short time later, Miami police learned that Blanco, 33, had stabbed himself to death with a steak knife while sheriff deputies were in pursuit in the Florida Keys. He stabbed himself in the stomach while his mother Marta Blanco-Mendoza swallowed pills during the chase through the woods. Blanco, 33, died at 4pm on Tuesday at a medical center while his mother remains in hospital. Their Siberian husky was handed over to an animal shelter. Miami Police were investigating at Blanco's home, police told MailOnline today, which he shared with his mother. The suspect had disappeared last week with his mother and dog on a boat to the Keys, the Miami Herald reported. Police questioned him on a boat this weekend but later let him go. Miami Police Detective Frederica Burden told the Herald: 'No one can even script a movie like this. It’s crazy.' The deaths are believed to be a murder-suicide, according to investigators. Blanco, who was 6'4' and weighed more than 200lb, was in a five-year relationship with Miss Gonzalez, relatives said, and it was believed that he abused her. She lived in fear, family told the Miami Herald, but finally left Blanco and moved into her own apartment but never pressed charges against him.

A motorcyclist who filmed himself careering off 'Britain's most dangerous road' at 60mph has been found guilty of dangerous driving after police spotted the video on YouTube. The shocking footage shows then 21-year-old Jack Sanderson flying off his bike and down a 40ft ridge as he swerved to avoid a car on the notorious Cat and Fiddle road in Macclesfield. Somehow Sanderson escaped with only minor injuries, despite the clip showing him repeatedly somersaulting down a hill. Scroll down for video . Near miss: Jack Sanderson, 21, just escaped crashing head-on into a car before flying down a steep bank . Ditched: The helmet camera shows Sanderson lying at the bottom of the ridge, somehow uninjured . The A537 Buxton New Road is known as the Cat and Fiddle road as it is home to a pub of the same name. It has repeatedly been branded Britain's most dangerous due to its sharp bends and steep drops - between 2007 and 2011 there were 44 fatal or serious accidents on the road. Sanderson posted the video of his crash on YouTube in order to 'warn other riders' about the dangers of the road, but it became such a hit that it drew the attention of police, who decided to prosecute. The video has racked up more than 100,000 views, and shows Sanderson overtaking two bikes before veering into the wrong lane and coming within inches of colliding with a car on a corner. He then flies off into a field and is thrown from his 600cc Kawasaki Ninja, with the whole incident filmed by a camera on his helmet. Steep fall: After avoiding the car, Sanderson heads down the hill and somersaults repeatedly . The dazed Sanderson is then seen getting to his feet, dusting himself down and clambering back up the hill to greet concerned onlookers who had stopped to help. His only wound was a cut hand - which he received when he grabbed hold of some barbed wire as he walked away from the crash. Sanderson, an engineer from Mobberley, Cheshire, said: 'I can't believe I walked out of that, not even with a broken bone. 'When I went over the ridge I was like helicopter spinning. I thought, this is it. I'm a goner. My bike stayed at the top of the ridge and I continued down. High-speed racing: The Cat and Fiddle road is notorious for motorbike racing and is Britain's most dangerous . Warning shot: Sanderson shared the video as a warning to other bikers, but his plan has now backfired . 'If my bike had followed me and crushed me, I would not be standing here today.' Sanderson was found guilty at a hearing at Macclesfield Magistrates Court and will be sentenced later this month. He has been banned from driving any vehicle in the meantime. The bike, which stopped at the top of the ridge, was written off and has been sold for parts. Because of its winding nature, the Cat and Fiddle road draws a large racing crowd, and is particularly popular with motorcyclists. In the 12 Road Safety Foundation charity reports since 2002, it has been come top of the list of most dangerous roads in eight. At 1,680ft it is also one of the highest roads in England. 1.

"By . Sara Malm for MailOnline . A pair of brothers have come up with a way to have a high-flying holiday on a budget – by building a human catapult . Johannes and Daniel Schrieber had been looking for a cheap alternative to flying, so constructed a 1,100lb catapult out of wood and old bicycle tubes. As you do. Despite the device raising several health and safety issues, the brothers claim they have taken precautions, by getting clarification from the German Aerospace Centre. Scroll down for video . Safety last: The 1,100lbs human catapult build by Johannes and Daniel Schrieber is seen in action at a lake in Frankfurt . Johannes, 26, and Daniel, 28, from Frankfurt, raised more than £700 through crowdfunding to make their 'budget flight' dream come true. Johannes, an engineering student, and Daniel, a maths graduate, then spent ten months constructing the mammoth machine in their grandmother’s barn, using old bicycle tubes as the spring. The contraption fires a person of average height and weight a distance of 40 feet, sending them about 16ft into the air. Johannes said: ‘Daniel and I wanted to give people the chance to fly - without the need for a plane. ‘You might not get as far, but it will certainly be hell of a lot of fun.' Safety first: The home-made human catapult sends a person into a 16ft high arch, and into a lake . Brothers in arms: Johannes Schrieber, 26, and brother Daniel, 28, from Frankfurt constructed the human catapult out of wood and old bicycle tubes . Spare-time fun: The brothers spent ten months in their grandmother's barn, constructing the human catapult . Come fly with me: Engineering student Johannes, gives a thumbs up before being launched into the lake . Up, up and away: To make sure their device was safe, the brothers had their catapult certified by the German Aerospace Centre . Mr Shrieber added: ‘All the research and funding was boring - but necessary - but now it's finished, the catapult is nothing but fun! ‘People can't really control what they do mid-air but more often than not they end up doing a somersault.’ To make sure nobody passed out from the G forces, the pair contacted the Institute of Aerodynamics and Flow Technology for clarification. Johannes said: ‘Our grand uncle told us people passed out in war planes from acceleration and we didn't want that happening. ‘Fortunately everything's alright and nobody has died yet!’ Great success: Johannes and Daniel are pleased with their human catapult as no one has died yet! Holidaying on a budget: The brothers say that the aim of the catapult was to offer everyone a chance to fly .","Johannes and Daniel Schrieber built a 1,100lb contraption themselves .

"By . Michael Gadd For Mailonline . Benidorm is the fastest growing destination for British holidaymakers for this coming bank holiday with the Spanish seaside resort town boasting a 164 per cent increase in departures compared to last year. Spain, Portugal, Greece and Turkey continue to top the figures for bank holiday popularity, according to figures from travel comparison website TravelSupermarket. The news isn't so sunny for Crete, Ibiza and the Black Sea, however, destinations which have all recorded significant drops in popularity over the past year. Best for British: Benidorm is 164 per cent more popular for the August bank holiday than it was last year . Old favourite: The perennial short break go-to destination is booming, says website TravelSupermarket . It's not just golden rays and sands being sought out for short breaks with Barcelona, Disneyland Paris, Paris and Amsterdam among the top 20 destinations being searched for with departure dates between August 20 and 23. Last year only Barcelona made the same list while Dubai and the Middle East have dropped out of the top 20 altogether. France is a hot destination as well this weekend, with Nice (156 per cent), Paris (104 per cent) and Disneyland Paris (76 per cent) all attracting more interest than in 2013. Sun-downer: Crete has suffered a 90 per cent drop in departures compared to last year . Benidorm – up 164% . Nice – up 156% . Halkidiki – up 119% . Paris – up 104% . Tuscany – up 91% .

TravelSupermarket spokesman Bob Atkinson said: 'With the Bank Holiday weekend here and many looking to get that last chance for a break before the long run into Christmas, it’s interesting to see so many people switching back into both the short break market, as well as value-led destinations in Europe and Egypt for their overseas holidays.' 'With the economy appearing to be strengthening, those who have put off taking extra or second holidays are embracing the chance for a few days away in places that are familiar, yet not too much of a stretch on the budget. Vive la France: Nice has enjoyed a 156 per cent rise in searches with Paris and Disneyland Paris also popular . 'And our love of eternal classics such as Benidorm, the Canary Islands, Balearics and the Algarve seems to be re-enforced this bank holiday, with getting more holiday for less money, high on the agenda for Brits. There are no long haul destinations in this year’s top 20, however Atkinson expects to see a rise in interest for locations such as Dubai and the Caribbean, along with Florida, New York and Las Vegas, when the sun well and truly disappears in the UK.","Benidorm has surged in popularity for this August bank holiday weekend .

"By . Bianca London for MailOnline . Miranda Kerr, Victoria Beckham and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley have more in common than wealth, beauty, style and success. The A-list trio all share a deep passion for wholesome living - and they credit their daily meditation, powerful chakras and positive affirmations for keeping them sane in an industry prone to self-destruction. Thanks to the glossy stars, mindfulness and clean living, which were once perceived as reserved for 'hippy' and 'bohemian' types, have become synonyms with success, fortune and, quite frankly, all things cool. The A-list way: A new retreat at Champneys teaches mindfulness, mediation, and yoga loved by Miranda Kerr, left, and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley . Miranda Kerr is the postergirl for positive living - she has even penned two self-help books, Treasure Yourself and Empower Yourself, packed with uplifting affirmations, while Victoria Beckham keeps her crystals on hand at all times when preparing for fashion shows. And it's not just supermodels and fashionistas at it. Arianna Huffington, who established the hugely successful Huffington Post, credits daily mindfulness and meditation for changing her life. Meanwhile, Jordan Belfort puts his success, in part, down to positive affirmations and visualisation. But can mere mortals incorporate these beliefs and practises into their daily life and create a living as alluring, lucrative and, seemingly, as fulfilling as the world's most powerful? Sandi Clark and Mike Mayes, who have launched a programme at Champneys based around these principles, think so and believe that if we all acted a little more like Miranda, the world would be a better place. Retreat: Sandi Clark and Mike Mayes are running a course, which is called Bring Yourself Back Into Your Life, and aims to help people discover how to put yourself in control of your life, at luxury health retreat Champneys . Facilities: In between the hourly sessions, guests are treated to all the usual luxuries that Champneys offers, including a Thallasotherapy pool session, which claims to help beat cellulite, pictured . Sandi and Mike are hosting weekend retreats within the luxurious grounds of Champneys Health Spa with the intent of helping people find themselves and put themselves back into their lives using the techniques and practises that the most successful of A-listers employ on a daily basis. 'Our retreats aim to help you facilitate your ongoing transformation, growth and empowerment. We will work with you on your energy levels of awareness, self-assessment and self-healing and teach you energy management using meditation giving you the skills to take control of your life and your future,' the couple from Devon say. Sandi and Mike's course, which is called Bring Yourself Back Into Your Life, aims to help people discover how to put yourself in control of your life, learn who you are, how to create a positive reality and be aware of the negative influences in your life. The duo aim to help guests find inner peace - that quiet place so rarely experienced in today’s stressful world - via mindfulness and meditation. And what better place to host it than at Champneys, which was the vision of Stanley Lief, who over 85 years ago pioneered the concept of holistic wellbeing, creating a place where people could escape the world’s cares and re-emerge revitalised. Revamp: While the property is currently undergoing major refurbishment, the bedrooms have been given a makeovera unrivalled views of rolling green hills (170 acres worth to be precise) Sleep, meditation and mindfulness are vital skills taught on the course and three things that entrepreneur Arianna Huffington, who describes herself as a 'sleep evangelist', swears by. Having trouble switching off or need a little 'me time' in the middle of a hectic day? Sandi and Mike believe meditation and mindfulness are essential. 'We don't call it meditation, but rather ""sitting""', says Mike. So how do you do it without getting distracted by thoughts of what to have for dinner? 'Sit comfortably, close your eyes and focus on your breath,' advises Mike. 'Meditation teaches you to manage your energy: to know how to respond spontaneously to any situation, when to allow your emotions to flow, when to suppress them, and to know the condition of your body. Above all, it enables you to take time out from the relentless activity of your mind, and shows you how to reach a place of peace whenever and wherever you choose. 'However little you can fit into your day is useful, pop to the toilet for five minutes twice a day and sit quietly. If distracting thoughts pop into your head, acknowledge them and let them pass. There are some great apps for guided meditation out there if you find it hard to do it alone. Next time you can't get to sleep, meditate for thirty minutes instead of reading a book or watching TV; you'll really notice the benefits.' Visualisation, also known as Mental Imagery, is a technique that has been proven to be extraordinarily successful in producing a specific outcome and is another key skill taught on the course. Make like Miranda: Sleep, meditation and mindfulness are vital skills taught on the course and there's daily yoga sessions on offer too . 'The next time you achieve something you're really proud of, make a note of what it feels like and conjure up that exact feeling when you need a little boost of confidence. It will get you in to the right mindset,' says Mike. Want proof that it works? Just ask Jordan Belfort (a.k.a the real Wolf of Wall Street who was a multi-millionaire by the age of 26 and was played by Leonardo Di Caprio in this year's most talked-about movie). He used visualisation before every important business meeting throughout his career. Sandi and Mike also teach guests the power of their Chakras - or spinning 'wheels' of energy located at seven points in the body. 'Chakras help to maintain your physical, mental, emotional and spiritual balance. Associated crystal gems, colours and scents are often used in Chakra Healing,' said Mike. While some find the notion of this a little far-fetched, Victoria Beckham recently revealed her ‘weird’ ritual of using crystals backstage at her fashion shows, specifically Pink Quartz and Black Tourmaline, to balance her chakras. Famous fan: Miranda, who has penned two self-help books, swears by the power of yoga and mindfulness and practises every morning . Well, if it works for her! Victoria Beckham recently revealed her 'weird' ritual of using crystals backstage at her fashion shows, specifically Pink Quartz and Black Tourmaline . See it to believe it: Jordan Belfort (a.k.a the real Wolf of Wall Street who was a multi-millionaire by the age of 26 and was played by Leonardo Di Caprio in this year's most talked-about movie) used visualisation before every important business meeting throughout his career - it sure worked . Revealing the rituals she credits for her success, the former Spice Girl said: ‘If I told you my backstage rituals, and was honest you would think I was a little weird. I carry my crystals with me which some people might think as odd but it works for us.’ The rocks are popular among many celebrities including Madonna and Angelina Jolie who believe they have healing powers, although there is no basis in science. In between the hourly sessions, guests are treated to all the usual luxuries that Champneys offers, including a Thallasotherapy pool session, which claims to help beat cellulite, and indulgent massages and facials using the super luxe Decleor and Carita ranges. There are also plenty of exercise classes on offer from high intensity spin to relaxing hatha yoga, and enough surrounding gardens to while away an afternoon if crashing out is more appealing than working out. While the property is currently undergoing major refurbishment (some of the changing facilities could use some work and a good scrub), the newly revamped bedrooms have unrivalled views of rolling green hills (170 acres worth to be precise) and the spa, which is packed with 60 treatment rooms, is top notch. Health kick: Food wise, eating like a supermodel is a prerequisite here. The day starts with a green shot (a potent concoction of cucumber, spinach, lime and pear) - and ends with flaxseed pizzas . Food wise, eating like a supermodel is a prerequisite here. The day starts with a green shot (a potent concoction of cucumber, spinach, lime and pear) - and ends with flaxseed pizzas. Portion sizes are, however, generous and if it's going to give you skin to rival Rosie Huntington-Whiteley - who credits her daily 'delicious green juice' for leaving her bright eyed and bushy tailed - then hold your nose, knock it back, and let it work its magic. Several green juices down and armed with the 'tools' loved by Miranda and her glossy pals, you'll feel ready to take on the world, one meditation session at a time. Namaste. The weekend, which includes two nights' accommodation, costs from £349.00 per person at Tring and Forest Mere.","Champneys offering two-night course .

"By . Associated Press . Two women are facing charges after they allegedly drank their duty-free alcohol in a plane's bathroom, triggered the fire alarm with a cigarette and got into a fight each other, forcing a flight bound for Cuba to return to Toronto under a military escort. Lilia Ratmanski, 25, and Milana Muzikante, 26, have been charged with smoking on board a Sunwing aircraft and endangering its safety. The airline said the flight had left Toronto on Wednesday afternoon at 4:30pm when it was disrupted by 'two unruly female passengers'. The two women have been living in Canada but Ratmanski is originally from Ukraine and Muzikante from Latvia. Lilia Ratmanski, 25, and Milana Muzikante, 26, (right) drank their duty-free in a toilet, lit a cigarette then got into a fight with each other forcing a flight from Toronto to Cuba to turn around on Wednesday . The friends are due to appear in court today and are charged with smoking on board an aircraft and endangering its safety . Sunwing vice-president Janine Chapman said the passengers, had consumed a 'significant quantity of their duty-free alcohol purchase in the lavatory'. She said they lit a cigarette, triggering the smoke alarm, and 'proceeded to get into a physical altercation with each other and made a threat against the aircraft.' NORAD said it scrambled two CF-18 fighter jets based out of Bagotville, Quebec, to escort Flight 656 back to Toronto. Major Julie Roberge, a spokeswoman for NORAD based in Colorado Springs, Colorado, said the CF-18s met the aircraft at the Canadian border and did not venture into American airspace. She said the pilot had decided to turn the plane around over South Carolina and 'that's when NORAD got involved,' adding there was no escort in U.S. airspace. Lilia Ratmanski, 25, drank duty-free alcohol in the bathroom of a flight headed for Cuba on Wednesday. She is due in court today . The two friends are due to appear in court today after their drunken brawl on board a Sunwing flight which had to be turned around and escorted back to Canada by fighter jets . Roberge said the aircraft landed at Toronto's Pearson International airport at about 8.30pm and that the CF-18 escort lasted just four minutes. She called the military escort a precautionary measure and a standard procedure in such incidents. Peel Region Constable Thomas Ruttan said the entire plane 'erupted in cheers' when the two were removed from the aircraft after it arrived back at Pearson. He said the pair will appear in court later today for a bail hearing and will also face additional charges including mischief endangering life and uttering threats. According to social media, Ratmanski is originally from Ukraine and Muzikante from Latvia.","Lilia Ratmanski, 25, and Milana Muzikante, 26, have been charged with smoking on board an aircraft and endangering its safety .

"By . Daniel Mills for Daily Mail Australia . Qantas has been forced to re-route international flights out of Sydney as a volcanic eruption spews ash into the air over Papua New Guinea. The giant ash cloud which is affecting some flights to and from Australia, could also force residents from Rabaul - the town nearest to the Tavurvur volcano which began erupting at 3.30am on Friday morning. Pictures and satellite imagery shows the plume has now reached up to a height of about 18 kilometres, indicating a significant eruption. Scroll down for video .

Residents could be forced to flee Rabaul as the ash falls over the burnt-out town . The volcano erupted on New Britain Island north east of the PNG mainland . The Bureau of meteorology issued an advisory to airlines indicating where the cloud is likely to spread. Qantas has confirmed it is re-routing flights to and from Sydney and Tokyo and out of Shanghai to Sydney to avoid the cloud. The airline has confirmed flight numbers QF21 and QF22, which operate between Sydney and Tokyo, and QF130 from Shanghai to Sydney will be  re-routed. A Qantas spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia that the re-routing the of flights would add an additional 10 minutes of flight time to the journeys. Commercial flights  typically cruise at altitudes of between nine and 12 kilometres and a Bureau of Meteorology spokesman told Fairfax Media 'The initial low-level ash is moving northwards.' 'But as it gets a bit higher it's likely to spread out both to the north and south along the western side of the volcano,"" Craig Earl-Spur said. Virgin Australia said it will monitor the cloud but had no flights scheduled to fly into the ash zone. PNG media reported that some residents were considering evacuating Rabaul - which was wiped out in 1994 when the same volcano erupted. The Vulcan and Tavurvur volcanoes forced locals to abandon the city temporarily. The Rabaul caldera at the north-east end of New Britain, PNG, has a history of regular low-level eruptions. The Tavurvur volcano experienced eruptive activity in early March that generated ash plumes up to one kilometre high. A meteorologist at the bureau's Darwin Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre said the The bureau will continue to monitor the plume as it dissipates.

Fabregas has earned many plaudits for his, and Chelsea's, impressive start to the season, but Wednesday night's Champions League tie saw him at his best, worst, and most bizarre. After signing for the west London club in the summer for £30m, Fabregas has been at the heart of a Chelsea team that has won all four of their Premier League matches so far this season. Huntelaar fires home for Schalke to rescue a point in Group G of the Champions League . The referee Ivan Bebek (left) stopped play to ask Cesc Fabregas (right) to remove a bracelet . Chelsea midfielder Fabregas removed the bracelet and proceeded to run to the touchline . In the 11th minute against Schalke, following a tackle many deemed to be reckless and card-worthy, Fabregas slotted past Ralf Fahrmann to put the home side ahead. Later though, the more negative side of the £150,000 a week midfielder's game came to the fore, as he was at fault for the Schalke equaliser that Chelsea could not overcome. Shortly before this, came the bizarre. There was a member of Chelsea's coaching staff ready to collect the jewellery in the dugout . Schalke players celebrate Klaas-Jan Huntelaar's equaliser at Stamford Bridge, as Fabregas (right) looks on . Cesc Fabregas' Wednesday night saw the best, the worst, and the bizarre . After 56 minutes, in an event more commonly seen on a Sunday league field, the referee Ivan Bebek stopped play and asked Fabregas to remove a bracelet he deemed to be dangerous to proceedings. The official then made sure it was removed, before eventually allowing play to continue. Unfortunately for Chelsea, and a bracelet-less Fabregas, the west Londoners conceded just five minutes later and could not regain the lead thereafter. Schalke held on for a point, and after a 1-1 draw in the other Group G match, all four teams are level going into the next Champions League match-day.

"By . Charles Sale . Follow @@charliesale . Former Tory treasurer Lord Jonathan Marland has emerged as a strong contender for the vacant Premier League chairmanship. Marland had discussions about the role before corporate financier Anthony Fry, who has stood down for health reasons, was appointed in April 2013. But Marland then had too many other business and political commitments, including being the Prime Minister’s trade envoy. These have now eased, leaving the Tory peer able to devote the number of days required for such a crucial football role. And Marland has both the stature and character to gain the respect of the 20 clubs in the top flight. Next in line? Lord Jonathan Marland is in the running to take the Premier League chairmanship . Marland made a late challenge to Giles Clarke in 2009 for the chairmanship of the England and Wales Cricket Board but withdrew before the vote, not having had enough time to win support around the counties. He had been particularly scornful of the ECB’s handling of the rift between Kevin Pietersen and Peter Moores. The PL panel, led by Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck, tasked with finding Fry’s successor are waiting until chief executive Richard Scudamore shows he’s fully fit to resume duties after major heart surgery before selecting a second chairman in two years. Former Southampton chairman Rupert Lowe is another name being linked with the PL chairmanship. Saints alive! Former Southampton chairman Rupert Lowe (C) has also been linked with the position . Even Geoffrey Boycott is now on Twitter, although its immediate response capability is rather lost for Boycs as he dictates his tweets for his more techno-savvy daughter Emma to post. .............................................................................. The word at the Old Trafford Test was that Giles Clarke will stand down as chairman of the ECB, with Yorkshire’s Colin Graves his most likely successor. However, the Clarke camp insists he wants to carry on, even after the county-influenced departure of close ally, ECB chief executive David Collier. Graves says he hasn’t thought about the chairmanship, and he may not want to leave Yorkshire having invested so much time and money into the county. .............................................................................. The FA intend to prioritise certain international tournaments in future so PL clubs know well in advance when players are needed. The PL are for once supportive of an FA policy. The clubs say the problem in the past has been the lack of information from the FA as to when players will be called up. THIN SKINNED ALLOTT . Paul Allott, mediocre presenter of Sky Sports’ Cricket Writers on TV, is ill-suited to host a show about media comment on the sport judging by his furious reaction to one sentence of negative opinion about his Lancashire board role — which also conflicts with his Sky job. Thin skinned: Sky presenter Paul Allott took exception to a question about his role on the Lancashire board . Sports Agenda reported relegation-threatened Lancashire members’ concerns that director of cricket Mike Watkinson reports on cricket matters to his close friend Allott. So when he spotted your columnist in a Lancashire VIP area during the Old Trafford Test, he demanded that security were called to remove me in such an exaggeratedly aggressive manner that even his son told him to calm down. Allott refused to accept that I had been invited into the hospitality area by one of his fellow board members until confirmed personally. Later, at an Old Trafford reception for the media, when Sports Agenda attempted to defuse the situation by asking for a quiet word with Allott, Lancashire’s equally preposterous chairman Michael Cairns said that couldn’t happen as the club lawyer wasn’t present. If Allott hadn’t been so busy enjoying himself in the Old Trafford hospitality boxes or trying to eject your columnist last Friday evening, he would have saved himself from an embarrassing altercation with fourth Test match referee Ranjan Madugalle the following morning. Embarrassing: Allott's suggestion to bring in the boundaries was given short shrift by Ranjan Madugalle (L) Allott, concerned that the drainage fiasco would continue to postpone play, went to see Madugalle to ask for the boundary ropes to be brought in. Allott was given short shrift as that option had been discounted the previous night — no changes can be made to the size of the playing area once the match has started.
