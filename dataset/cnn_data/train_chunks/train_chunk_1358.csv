"The wife of an Al Qaeda recruiter who mentored the Charlie Hebdo murderers is appealing against her own terror conviction on human rights grounds, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. In a case that has already cost UK taxpayers tens of thousands of pounds, Sylvie Beghal, 45, who lives on benefits in Leicester, is seeking to overturn her conviction for refusing to co-operate with British police who were investigating her husband. Djamel Beghal, 50, a former disciple of the hate clerics Abu Hamza and Abu Qatada, is known to have met with at least two of the gunmen who terrorised Paris last week – and hosted on-the-run suspect Hayat Boumeddiene for ‘crossbow practice’ while he was under house arrest in France. Sylvie Beghal, 45, is seeking to overturn her conviction for refusing to co-operate with British police who were investigating her husband Djamel Beghal, 50, a former disciple of the hate clerics Abu Hamza and Abu Qatada . French citizen Mrs Beghal and the couple’s four children still live in Leicester where she is awaiting judgment on her case after taking her appeal all the way to the Supreme Court. Three years ago she was arrested and charged after being stopped at a British airport, where she refused to answer questions about her husband, who is in prison in France facing charges of leading a terrorist organisation. She pleaded guilty to at least one charge related to terror laws but later appealed against the conviction on human rights grounds. Her case, being supported by pressure group Cage and the Muslim Council of Britain, is understood to have been brought using legal aid as it proceeded through the High Court, Appeal Court and Supreme Court. Beghal, a French citizen born in Algeria, lived in Britain during the late 1990s where he was a regular at Finsbury Park Mosque and came under the influence of Abu Hamza and Abu Qatada. But he later moved with his family to Afghanistan – allegedly because he was inspired by Qatada – was arrested as a suspected terrorist just weeks before the 9/11 attacks and subsequently convicted in France for his links to Al Qaeda in 2005. Charlie Hebdo murderers Said Kouachi and his brother Cherif met Djamel Beghal under house arrest . After serving half of a ten-year sentence, the French government were attempting to deport him to Algeria when he was rearrested in 2010 on fresh charges. But he came under fresh scrutiny last week as it emerged that Cherif Kouachi, one of the gunmen in the Charlie Hebdo attack; Amedy Coulibaly, who was killed after taking hostages in a grocery store; and his girlfriend Boumeddiene, who is still on the run, had all visited him in Murat, central France, while he was under house arrest. When questioned later by police, Boumeddiene, photographed posing with weapons in a burqa, said she and her husband had visited the convicted terrorist for ‘crossbow practice’. Officers also photographed Beghal playing football with Kouachi in 2010. In Britain, Mrs Beghal’s case is seen as a key test of the legitimacy of Schedule 7 powers under the Terrorism Act 2000, which allow police to stop, examine and search passengers at ports, airports and international rail terminals. Beghal, a French citizen born in Algeria, lived in Britain during the late 1990s where he was a regular at Finsbury Park Mosque (pictured) and came under the influence of Abu Hamza and Abu Qatada . Beghal was jailed for 10 years for terrorism offences and is banned from the UK -  but his wife remains here . On January 4, 2011, following a visit to her husband in France, Mrs Beghal returned to Britain with three of her children, arriving at East Midlands Airport, at 8.05pm and was detained by officers from Leicestershire police under the Schedule 7 powers. She was told she was not under arrest and the police did not suspect her of being a terrorist but they needed to speak to her ‘to establish if she may be a person concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism’. She was asked about her relationship with her husband, how she had paid for her flight to Paris and whether anyone else had paid for it but refused to answer. Beghal and Cherif Kouachi, one of the brothers responsible for the Charlie Hebdo massacre, were on such good terms that intelligence officers saw them playing football together with two other terrorists . She was charged with assaulting a police officer, wilfully obstructing a search under Schedule 7, and wilfully failing to comply with a duty under Schedule 7. The prosecution offered no evidence on the first two charges when she pleaded guilty to the last charge. In a Court of Appeal judgment seen by The Mail on Sunday, Lord Justice Gross said ‘inhibiting’ the travel of terrorists served ‘a manifestly rational purpose’ and ‘the ability to question widely’ was necessary. ‘Given that Mrs Beghal was returning to the UK following a visit to her husband, imprisoned in France for terrorism offences, the obvious inference is that she was not stopped on a random basis,’ he said. Last night, Lord Carlile, the former counter-terrorism adviser to the Government, said: ‘Schedule 7 powers are absolutely essential. It would be extremely damaging to the national interest if they ceased to exist.’ Mrs Berghal lives with her four children in a smart house next to a park in Leicester. She issued a statement via Cage, saying: ‘Once again my husband is punished for something he didn’t do. We just want to be left alone and live a peaceful life.’ Beghal, pictured in 2000, was banned from the UK on grounds of national security in 2009 .","Sylvie Beghal lives in a taxpayer-funded four-bedroom home in Leicester .

"A clergyman who suddenly resigned from a church post explained: ‘God made me do it.’ Father Timothy Lipscomb said he received a ‘message from above’ while delivering a sermon at Preston Minster, Lancashire. It triggered his abrupt exit from the role of Area Dean, a managerial-type position in which he oversaw clergy in the region. Puzzled: Father Timothy Lipscomb (pictured) said: ‘It’s a busy role and takes up a lot of time. But God clearly doesn’t want me to do it any more.'I’m not quite sure why. I really wish I knew' Father Timothy, the vicar of Preston, said: ‘I was in church in the middle of a sermon and I felt like God shouted at me to give up being Area Dean. ‘I went to see the Bishop about it and he asked me if I didn’t like the job. I said, ‘‘Yes, I do.” ‘But you can’t go against the will of God, can you? So I have given it up.’ Father Timothy handed over the reins to the Rev Brian McConkey of Christ Church, Fulwood, Lancashire, last week after 16 years as Area Dean. He is to continue in his primary role as the vicar of Preston. He said: ‘I’ve enjoyed my time in the job – Area Dean is a sort of line manager for clergy in the area. ‘It’s a busy role and takes up a lot of time. But God clearly doesn’t want me to do it any more. 'I’m not quite sure why. I really wish I knew. Perhaps He feels I’ve done enough. 'People have been asking me if I’m ill, or if I’ve had enough. But it’s not like that at all. 'It was strange really – similar to when I was called to the priesthood. It was that sort of experience. I really don’t know what His thinking was.’","Father Timothy Lipscomb exited his managerial role abruptly .

"A British millionaire businessman who has spent 28 years in prison – including 15 years on Death Row – for a double murder because of an ‘epic miscarriage of justice’ spoke of his despair yesterday after a Florida judge crushed his hope of freedom. Kris Maharaj, 75, who is in poor health, believed he was on the verge of release because of sensational new evidence showing that the men he was convicted of killing at a Miami hotel in 1986 – father and son Derrick and Duane Moo Young – were actually executed by a Colombian drug cartel. But despite statements from key members of the cartel, including cocaine king Pablo Escobar’s former hitman, Maharaj’s appeal was rejected last week. His earliest possible release date remains 2040. British millionaire businessman Kris Maharaj, 75, has spent 15 years on Death Row for a double murder . The new evidence in Maharaj’s case was first revealed by The Mail on Sunday – and speaking through his lawyer, he told this paper yesterday that Friday’s ruling was a ‘terrible body blow’. He added: ‘I just don’t know how long I can survive, though I must fight on. Please tell my wife that if I have to suffer in this place until I am 90 I will endure it so I can get back to her.’ But his tearful wife Marita, who speaks to her husband every day on the phone, said: ‘He’s very sick and I am worried that he won’t leave prison alive. I can’t believe this has happened. I am heartbroken.’ Before the start of the brief hearing at the Miami court, Maharaj’s lawyers, led by Clive Stafford Smith of human rights charity Reprieve, were hugely confident. They had already revealed their compelling new evidence to the court in November. It included testimony from Jhon Jairo Velasquez Vasquez, Escobar’s top assassin, who said his boss had ordered the hit because he’d discovered the Moo Youngs were taking a cut of cocaine money they were supposed to launder. Krishna Maharaj`s wife Marita being comforted by Clive Stafford smith and Ben Kuehne in Court after hearing the verdict to  overturn the conviction for murder was rejected . ‘They had stolen his [Escobar’s] money and that of his partners and… therefore they had to die,’ said Velasquez, who named the killer as his cartel colleague Guillerno Zuluaga, now dead. In addition, former Miami policeman Michael Flynn said corrupt officers later helped frame the British businessman. Maharaj – once one of Britain’s richest men, whose horses raced against the Queen’s – said: ‘I sat in court while compelling witnesses said the cartels did the crime. By the end [of the November hearing] I was sure that this time, after all these years, I was going home.’ But Judge William Thomas told the court on Friday that the new evidence was ‘too weak’ and there were ‘admissibility issues’. While Mr Stafford Smith, who has been involved with the case since 1993, believes there are strong grounds for appeal, he is worried that Maharaj is running out of time. ‘The process grinds slowly and could take another year. Kris doesn’t have that time,’ he said. Maharaj said he has ‘already come very close to death twice’ in prison – once when he suffered gangrene in his arm and again when he contracted the flesh-eating bug necrotising fasciitis. He said he had gone from ‘living like a prince to existing like an animal’. Schooled in Trinidad, he moved to Peckham, South London, in 1960. With the help of a £1,500 loan he quickly built up a thriving food import business. A fixture of the ‘swinging London’ social scene, he loved collecting Rolls-Royces, but his greatest passion was racehorses. At one time he owned 110 – the second-biggest stable in Britain. In 1974 his horse King Levanstell won the prestigious Queen Alexandra Stakes at Royal Ascot, defeating a thoroughbred owned by the Queen. The Queen at Ascot in 1974 when a horse owned by the British millionaire businessman won . He began to invest in property in the 1980s and formed a business with Derrick Moo Young, ostensibly a respectable Florida businessman. But Maharaj says he soon discovered that Moo Young had embezzled £300,000 from the firm. The bodies of Derrick and his son Duane were found in room 1215 of the Miami Plaza Hotel on October 16, 1986. Derrick, 53, had been shot six times. His son, 23, died from a single bullet from a gun placed in his mouth as he knelt by the bed. Maharaj has always insisted that he was having lunch 30 miles away at the time – an alibi supported by five witnesses, who, inexplicably, were never called to testify. But his fingerprints were in room 1215. Maharaj said he had been let into the room for a business meeting there earlier that day, but the man he was waiting for did not turn up. Mr Stafford Smith presented evidence that a man with known links to the cartel was the only other registered occupant of the 12th floor of the Dupont on the night the Moo Youngs were killed. Mr Stafford Smith called the case an ‘epic miscarriage of justice’ and said he had never been more convinced of a client’s innocence. ‘I’m shell-shocked,’ he said. Maharaj spent 15 years on Death Row before his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment.","Kris Maharaj, 75, has spent 15 years on Death Row for a double murder .

"Bilal Mirza (pictured) 18, was fatally stabbed as he walked through Marylebone, in central London, at around 10.40pm on Thursday . A mother wept in court as her teenage son was remanded in custody over the murder of a young man who was stabbed to death in central London. Bilal Mirza, 18, had been walking along a street in Marylebone, London at around 10.40pm on Thursday when he was attacked and stabbed. He  later died in hospital. Now a 16-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is accused of fatally wounding Bilal. He is also charged with possession of an offensive weapon without lawful authority or reasonable excuse in a public place in relation to a multi-tool knife. Appearing at London's Westminster Magistrates' Court, he was told that his case will be heard at the Old Bailey on Tuesday. Dressed in black and with her head covered, the boy's mother spoke to him briefly before he was sent to a youth detention centre. The youth tried to touch his mother's hand through the dock's glass panels and also began to cry as he was taken away. District Judge Denis Brennan told the defendant: 'I have no power other than to send the matter to the Central Criminal Court and I do so together with the allegation of possession of an offensive weapon.' The court heard that police were called to reports of a stabbing outside Lea House on Salisbury Street on Thursday night. Bilal was taken to a central London hospital where he was pronounced dead. A post-mortem examination gave a stab wound to the thigh as the cause of death. Scotland Yard have appealed to local youths to come forward with information. Detective Chief Inspector Noel McHugh said: 'My condolences are with Bilal's family at this tragic time, and our investigation continues to evidence exactly what took place and led to his death. The 16-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is charged with the murder and one count of possession of an offensive weapon  in a public place . 'Whilst we have had good support from local community affected by this violent crime, and a number of witnesses come forward, I continue my appeals for more people, especially young people, to come forward. 'I know that there were several youths in the area at the time of the stabbing and I am appealing directly to them to come forward and speak with officers. 'They can be assured that any call they make to us will be treated in the strictest of confidence. 'If you were in the area and saw what happened please call our incident room.' The teen has been remanded in custody until the case is heard at London's Old Bailey on 13 January.

"Crying off: McAvoy admitted to feigning upset during an audition . When James McAvoy wanted to cry off from an audition, that’s exactly what he did – literally. The X-Men star has admitted he once pretended a friend had been hurt in a car crash, and then burst into fake tears to cut short a disastrous try-out for a new film. McAvoy, 35, now one of Britain’s most acclaimed stars, admitted: ‘My agent suggested something that she thought was going to be great for me. 'I needed to learn songs and to play the guitar. ‘I said, “No problem,” but the day came and I was rubbish at all of that. 'I stood in front of them and thought, “I’ve got to get out of this,” so I started to cry and said, “I’ve just had a phone call. My mate has been knocked down, he’s at the hospital and I have to go.” ’ The star, who found fame in the Channel 4 series Shameless before being cast as the fawn Mr Tumnus in 2005 film The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe, confessed to his deception on BBC TV’s Graham Norton Show. McAvoy said: ‘If they [the producers] are watching this they will be thinking, “We really believed him and he is a b******!” ‘I am sorry for that.’ The actor is due to star in a new stage production of The Ruling Class at the Trafalgar Studios in London’s West End.

"Hecklers stood up and chanted repeatedly 'we believe the women' during Bill Cosby's third and final performance of a Canadian tour on Friday night. The hecklers then marched out of the theater in Hamilton as the 77-year-old comedian asked his audience not to react. Cosby is facing growing sexual assault allegations from more than 15 women, with some claims dating back decades. He has denied the allegations through his lawyer, has never been charged and has never publicly spoken of them publicly. The walk-out during Friday's show came a day after a man at Cosby's performance in London, Ontario, called the comedian 'a rapist'. Scroll down for video .

Warning: A sign posted outside of the Hamilton Place Theatre ahead ofBill Cosby's show . Scores of demonstrators brave the cold to protest against a show by Bill Cosby on Friday night . It also took place just minutes after Cosby acknowledged the controversy that has followed him on the tour, with protesters camping outside the venues with sandwich boards. 'Whatever happens here tonight if there's some sort of outburst, we just have to remain calm and things will be taken care of. It oughtn't last that long,' he told the audience. 'I want to thank all of you here tonight because you stayed with what you believed in.' An announcement at the start of the show warned the audience there might be attempts to disrupt the show and urged ticket holders to remain calm until the matter 'is resolved'. Security at the venue was tight — bags were searched and police officers and private security guards were posted along the aisles of the theatre. The three shows in Canada were Cosby's first since November when he had a string of performances canceled over the accusations. Many protesters took aim at the venues that agreed to let Cosby perform in light of the scandal plaguing him. Touch down: Bill Cosby gets off his private jet and arrives in Hamilton, Canada, on Friday afternoon . Cold arrival: Cosby landed in Hamilton a few hours before the performance, which was his last of three . During a rare moment in Thursday night's show at the same venue, Cosby alluded to his sexual assault scandal. As he saw a woman getting up from the front row of the theater, Cosby asked where she was going. She said she was getting a drink and politely asked if he wanted her to bring anything back for him,  according to National Post reporter Richard Warnica who attended the event. He said no, that he had his own bottle of water and then said 'You have to be careful drinking around me.' The statement refers to a theme in several of his accusers' stories - that he drugged their drinks before raping them. Warnica says the crowd erupted in loud gasps, but that their shock soon turned to support as they laughed and gave a round of applause for the comment. Thursday night's show was the second in a three-stop comedy tour of Canada. Both nights have been the subject of protests outside the venues, as ticket-holders were heckled by demonstrators holding signs like 'rape is not joke'. Both of Cosby's show s in Canada have been the subject of protests this week. Above, some of the demonstrators outside of his show Thursday night . Before the show started, Warnica tweeted a photo of a piece of paper handed out to those walking into venue Budweiser Gardens. The slip of paper warns 'disruptive behavior will not be tolerated and will result in removal, possible legal action and banning from the venue'. One man was kicked out of Thursday night's event for yelling 'you are a rapist'. Dale Carruthers, a journalist who tried to film the man being escorted out by security, was also kicked out. Cosby's publicist later confirmed the heckler in a statement, describing the situation as 'one outburst' in a crowd of 'loyal, patient and courageous' fans. The statement ends with Cosby saying 'I'm far from finished'. Warnica says that while the venue was not full, it was far from empty and the crowd seemed to enjoy Cosby's performance. He received a standing ovation for a second night in a row. Heckled: Canadians attending both events in Kitchener and London have been heckled by the crowds demonstrating outside the event .

"The world’s most wanted female terrorist has fled to Syria, it was revealed last night – as police admitted they stopped surveillance on her deadly Parisian cell six months ago because they were deemed ‘low-risk’. Hayat Boumeddiene, the widow of one of the gunmen who massacred 17 civilians in the French capital – is now thought to be with her murderous Islamic State allies after fleeing the country. Official sources in Paris said that 24-hour scrutiny of members of her terror cell had been dropped to focus on other targets. Last night, Boumeddiene, 26, was branded ‘armed and dangerous’ by France’s top policeman Jean-Marc Falcone, who said she was believed to have helped plan the attacks. The crossbow terror girl on the run: Hayat Boumeddiene, wife of the jihadi in Paris deli siege, posing with a lethal weapon in Murat, central France, in 2010 . Boumeddiene, right, walked away from a low-paid job as a cashier  in 2009 and started wearing a veil. She ‘devoted herself’ to Coulibaly, left . As long as five years ago she was pictured in full Islamic dress and using a lethal crossbow in the French countryside where she met jihadi recruiters. She and the three Paris killers were all known to the security services. Yet despite their fanatical hatred of the West and access to weapons, police decided to stop tracking them in July 2014. It has emerged that hundreds of phone calls between Boumeddiene and Izzana Hamyd, wife of Cherif Kouachi, have shown up on mobile records. Five hundred in all were made last year. Boumeddiene was reported to have flown from Madrid to Istanbul on January 2, crossing the Turkish border into Syria on Thursday. This was the day after brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi, murdered 12 people at the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. It was also the day her husband, Amedy Coulibaly, murdered a female police officer before shooting four hostages at a kosher delicatessen in Eastern Paris. The suggestion is that Boumeddiene knew the attacks were due to take place and fled. French police named the hostage taker as Amedy Coulibaly, left, 32, but Boumeddiene, right, 26, is not thought to have been at his side at the time . Her husband and the Kouachi brothers were all gunned down by police commandos at the end of two sieges on Friday. Last night, as France remained on high alert, extraordinary stories of courage emerged from those caught up in the deadly attacks: . - A heroic customer at the kosher deli grabbed one of Coulibaly’s guns – but paid with his life after the weapon jammed . - A Muslim worker at the shop helped Jewish customers hide from the terrorist, in what was hailed as an inspiring act of bravery . - A father told how he and his three-year-old son had tried to hide from Coulibaly in the store basement, but was forced to follow the gunman’s orders until police launched their raid, killing the terrorist in a hail of bullets as he ran out of the shop’s doors . - A hostage revealed how he bandaged a neck wound suffered by Charlie Hebdo murderer Said Kouachi, after the brothers took shelter at his printing works . Special forces stormed the Jewish grocery to the east of Paris where terrorist Amedey Coulibaly had taken at least seven people hostage . Hostages - who had been held for hours with Coulibaly threatening to kill them - flee from the shop . Meanwhile, the family of a Muslim police officer shot dead by the brothers described them as ‘madmen’ with no religion. Up to a million people, including David Cameron and other world leaders, are expected to join a march for peace and unity in Paris today. Counter-terrorism ministers including Home Secretary Theresa May will also meet to discuss the West’s response to the growing threat of Islamist violence. In London, landmarks including Tower Bridge and Trafalgar Square will display the colours of the French flag to show solidarity. Security patrols were also being stepped up across London amid increased fears of attacks on Jewish communities. And Scotland Yard is asking travellers returning to Britain from France if they saw ‘any suspicious activity’ while away. Boumeddiene and her co-conspirators were put under phone, internet and physical surveillance at the end of 2011, when Said Kouachi returned from Yemen, where he trained with Al Qaeda. There he met Anwar Al-Awlaki, a terrorist mastermind later killed in a US drone strike. ‘But between that date and the summer of 2014, nothing suggested any connection with a radical Islamist movement,’ said a Paris judicial source. ‘So the surveillance was stopped in order to refocus on other individuals who at that moment presented a higher risk.’ The body of a man can be seen at the entrance of the Jewish supermarket after it was stormed by commandos . From bikini beach girl... to jihadi with her crossbow . Wearing a skimpy bikini as she embraces her muscular boyfriend, she looks like any other attractive young beachgoer on the French Riviera. But the once-glamorous Hayat Boumeddiene, 26, is now the most wanted female terrorist suspect in the world. She is reported to have fled to Syria before her 32-year-old husband Amedy Coulibaly – the smiling young man in the picture – murdered four Jews in a Paris deli. There were suggestions yesterday that Boumeddiene had helped her husband, along with fellow terrorists Said and Cherif Kouachi, compile an arsenal of weapons which Paris prosecutors said included two Russian-made Tokarev machine pistols, commercial explosives and hunting knives. Together: Hayat Boumeddiene on holiday with Amedy Coulibaly . It is thought that the firearms were smuggled from the Balkans into Europe, and then into France by car – something a single woman is likely to have been able to get away with far easier than men. As detectives try to learn more about the group responsible for France’s worst terrorist outrage this century, they know that piecing together Boumeddiene’s transformation from a relaxed young woman into a terrorist training with a crossbow will be essential. The former supermarket cashier is said to have been radicalised by the man she would go on to marry in an Islamic, rather than civil, ceremony. Like her husband, Boumeddiene was born into a large family of seven children, but when she was just six her mother died. She is from an Algerian background and family members altered their surname to ‘make it sound more French’, according to an investigating source. Estranged from her father, Boumeddiene ended up in care, relying on social workers to bring her up. She was in her early 20s when she met Coulibaly in Juvisy, the rundown Paris suburb where he was brought up. Questioned by police at his home in Nanterre, another Paris suburb, Boumeddiene’s father yesterday said he was ‘shocked and horrified’ to learn his daughter was involved with a terrorist cell. Taking aim: Boumeddiene and Coulibaly on another break in Cantal in 2010 . But this time to meet his terror mentor Djamel Beghal in rural France, where they both learned how to use a crossbow . She told police who interviewed her in 2010 as part of their inquiries into Coulibaly’s dealings with Islamic extremists that she had walked away from a low-paid job as a cashier in 2009 and began wearing an Islamic veil, the kind that is now illegal in France. Boumeddiene said that she was inspired by her husband and the radicals she lived with to ‘read a lot of books on religion, and because of this I came to ask questions on religion’. She added: ‘When I saw the massacre of the innocents in Palestine, in Iraq, in Chechnya, in Afghanistan or anywhere the Americans sent their bombers, all that… well, who are the terrorists?’ She said that when Americans killed innocents, it was the right of men to defend their women and children – one of the reasons she said she started weapons training. Along with Coulibaly, she was pictured in 2010 visiting a convicted Al Qaeda terrorist, mentor Djamel Beghal – who was radicalised at the Finsbury Park mosque in North London – while he was under house arrest in Murat, Central France. Until recently the couple lived in Bagneux, a suburb of Paris where they were known as a devoutly religious . When police questioned her and said they knew she and Coulibaly had visited Beghal at the same time as Cherif Kouachi and two other convicted terrorists – jihadi recruiter Ahmed Laidouni and Farid Melouk of the Armed Islamic State terror group – she replied: ‘We went there for crossbow practice.’ Until recently the couple lived in Bagneux, a suburb of Paris where they were known as a devoutly religious, despite Coulibaly’s regular run-ins with the law. To neighbours, the pair were quiet and respectful. But while Boumeddiene had no criminal record, Coulibaly has a long history of both petty and serious crimes. The only boy of a family of ten in Juvisy, he first came to police attention as a 17-year-old. Convictions for theft and drug offences followed and he was arrested for an attempted armed robbery on a bank in Orleans in September 2002. Boumeddiene, who was never seen in public without her veil, waited four years for Coulibaly to come out of jail after his conviction for armed robbery. She met the younger of the Kouachi brothers, Cherif, at a time when the pair were linked with a jihadist recruitment ring that sent fighters to Iraq. Cherif was convicted in 2008 and sentenced to three years in jail, with 18 months suspended, for his association with the underground organisation. He had wanted to fly to Iraq via Syria and was found with a manual for a Kalashnikov – the automatic weapon used in last week’s outrages. ...and her husband's bloody journey from Finsbury Park mentor to death at deli .

"A 95-year-old retired headteacher will become the oldest person to stand trial in Britain after he denied a string of sexual offences dating back over half-a-century. Jack Mount, who was born in 1919, faces 50 counts of abusing children over a 25 year period, between 1953 and 1979. The former head of the privately-run Brookside School, near Craven Arms, Shropshire, faces nine charges of rape, seven of indecency with a child, 20 of indecent assault, and 14 other serious sexual assault charges. Retired headteacher Jack Mount, 95, has denied 50 historic sexual offences dating back over half a century . The alleged offences involve 17 victims, both boys and girls, in South Shropshire, Barnsley, and Birmingham. All the complainants were aged between seven and 13 when they claim they were abused by Mount, who lives in South Molton, Devon. Mount, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, appeared at Birmingham Crown Court on Friday afternoon for a plea and case management hearing. The pensioner, wearing a tweed jacket and green jumper with a brown tie, pleaded not guilty to all 50 counts which were put to him during the 25-minute hearing. The OAP was released on bail by His Honour Judge Melbourne Inman QC, the Recorder of Birmingham, but a date was not set for his next court appearance. 'In my judgement the case should be tried nearer to where Mr Mount resides. The alleged offences were said to have taken place at the privately-run Brookside School, near Craven Arms, Shrops, between 1953 and 1979 . 'I put a full account together before Christmas but I haven't been told where it will be tried. 'So I am not setting a date now. Adjourning this case, unusually, I can't give a specific date but will try to get a trial date set as soon as possible.' Mount, who will be 96 by the time a trial is expected to start in the summer, was allowed to sit at the back of the court, rather than in the dock, since he is hard of hearing. Prosecutor Maria Karaiskos said: 'There is to be a total of 17 complainants for the trial.' Benjamin Williams, defending, said: 'It is expected that the trial will last eight weeks. The defendant may only be able to sit for half a day at a time.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Jack Mount was the head of privately-run Brookside School, Shropshire .

"A manhunt is under way for Owen Bonner, 47, who once boasted he was 'worse than the devil' A manhunt was under way last night for a dangerous psychiatric patient – who once boasted he was worse than the devil – after he absconded in a busy city centre. The public have been warned not to approach Owen Bonner, who was declared insane by a judge during his trial for holding two women hostage in a factory. The 47-year-old was on escorted leave from a secure hospital on Friday when he escaped in Glasgow city centre. He has been in psychiatric care for the past 20 years after a brutal knife attack on the women during a five-hour siege in 1994. Bonner is described as being 5ft 10in tall and slim. He has blue eyes and short grey hair. When he was last seen he was wearing blue jeans, a black body warmer and a black beanie hat. Bonner took fellow workers Geraldine Henderson and Louise Ward hostage while they were on their shift at the Marshall’s Chunky Chicken factory, in Coatbridge, Lanarkshire. He made a series of bizarre demands, saying he wanted TV cameras, a Michael Jackson outfit and the popstar’s album Thriller. At one point, he dragged Ms Henderson across the floor, his arm wrapped tightly round her neck, and shouted: ‘I am worse than the devil. Pray with me.’ The 47-year-old was on escorted leave from a secure unit at New Stobhill Hospital on Friday when he escaped in Glasgow city centre .","A manhunt was under way last night for psychiatric patient Owen Bonner .

"Jamie O'Brien seems to have perfected the art of the board transfer. The 31-year-old surfer from Hawaii appeared in a GoPro video posted to YouTube that shows the acrobatic athlete jumping from one surfboard to another as a giant wave crests behind him. O'Brien was riding waves at Banzai Pipeline, often referred to simply as Pipeline, off the island of O'ahu, famous in surfing circles for the tubes created by reefs under the water. Scroll down for video . Poised: In a video for GoPro, Jamie O'Brien caught a wave at Pipeline off the coast of the island of O'ahu with a second board in tow . Transfer: With a lighter board at the ready, O'Brien was looking to jump off and ride out the giant curl while filming the feat . Daring: Just above the reef break, O'Brien hopped off the longer board and rode out the wave . 'The process is to have fun,' O'Brien says in the video. 'Pick the right wave, grab the board off the front with one hand, spin it around, hopefully pull in and come out.' The surfer carried his second, lighter board on the front, and when the time came, maneuvered it into position and took off down the wave. O'Brien has been trying to perfect the trick since at least 2013, when he was filmed attempting the switch at Second Reef, the second section from the shore where waves typically break. Team: O'Brien is sponsored by Red Bull, which has partnered in the past with GoPro, a company that has hosted O'Brien for events in the past . Tubular: O'Brien recorded footage from inside the curling wave with the help of a camera mounted onto his body . Surfer Magazine reports that O'Brien 'doubled up' back in August, successfully hitting his board transfer at the Wedge, a surf spot in Newport Beach, California, but this attempt was captured in multiple angles. The Red Bull-sponsored athlete was filmed with multiple cameras from GoPro, who has partnered with the energy drink company in the past and has hosted O'Brien at events, according to ESPN.","Jamie O'Brien hopped from one board to another while riding a wave at Pipeline off the coast of the island of O'ahu .

"The wild boar population in Britain is expected to increase dramatically in coming years as a wildlife expert has called for the animal to be given the same protection as other game species. Earlier this week Raymond Green was killed on the M4 after hitting a wild boar and the animal was also blamed for killing one of the Princess Royal's Glocestershite Old Spot sows at a farm in the Cotswolds. Although the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs estimates there is around 1,000 boar living wild in Britain, some experts claim that the true figure is at least ten times that. Scroll down for video . A wildlife expert is calling for the wild boar to be given the same protection as other game species despite the animals population rising dramatically in recent years . Charlie Jacoby believes that wild boar are colonising much of the country, as it has done in Sweden . Earlier this week Raymond Green was killed on the M4 after hitting a wild boar and then colliding with a lorry . Field sports author Charlie Jacoby has called for the animal to be regarded as part of our native wildlife and given the same protection as other game species. At present there are no restrictions on shooting wild boar during the breeding season. It's feared that indiscriminate shooting could lead to them being wiped out in Britain again, as they were in the 13th Century. Mr Jacoby believes that the animal is colonising much of the country, as it has done in Sweden.  A record-breaking wild boar weighing an estimated 518lb was shot in Herefordshire in 2008.They are also regularly found in Kent and East Sussex and the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire. He told The Times: 'Numbers would remain stable for a few years then every four or five years they could shoot up. It was largely the combination of climate and food supplies that were crucial, and we are seeing the same thing happening here in the boom years. 'Now most Sweedish hunters have rifles as well as shotguns and boar have replaced pheasant as the main game species.' Wild boar can run up to 30mph and weigh around 20 stone when fully grown. They can also jump 6ft. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs estimates there is around 1,000 boar living wild in Britain, some experts claim believe that the true figure is at least ten times that; the spread of commercial crops such as maize is said to be behind the population increase . Wild boar are know to damage crops and 'plough up' gardens and meadows, while rooting for food, which makes them unpopular with landowners. Hunting the animal is popular in Germany were landowners are compensated for allowing the animals to remain on their land. Mr Jacoby told the newspaper he does not believe that boar-hunting will catch on in England where the animal has become largely nocturnal. However, in Scotland hunters pay big money to hunt wild boar at shooting estates. Simon Gaskell, who owns the Real Boar Company that breeds the animal for salami, said: 'Wild boar do travel and they are prepared to travel quite a distance. It's only a matter of time before they start causing trouble.' In 2013 people living in and around the Forest of Dean said they were increasingly uneasy about the number of wild boar nearby . Rangers say the Forest of Dean wild boar population is doubling every year thanks to the spread of commercial crops such as maize. In 2013 people living in and around the Forest of Dean said they were increasingly uneasy about the number of wild boar nearby. Wild boar dug up land where the ashes of loved ones were scattered at the Pan Tod Beacon beauty spot on Ruardean Hill outside Cinderford. The animals also destroyed grass verges in the area and in 2013 the Forestry Commission announced a cull on the population. In 2008 one had to be shot at Ruardean Primary School and two years later the animals destroyed a football pitch. Wild boar were hunted to extinction in Britain several centuries ago. But their population has started to rise again after several programmes to reintroduce them in the last 15 years. There are now thriving herds spreading out into the countryside. Boar are usually secretive and nocturnal and are likely to stay out of the way of humans. When fully grown a wild boar weighs around 20 stone and can jump 6ft. They can also travel large distances and reach speeds of 30mph. In medieval times, boar from the Royal Forest were supplied for the Royal table - there is a record of an order for 100 boars and sows for a Christmas feast in 1254. Boar are known to inhabit parts of the Cotswolds and the Forest of Dean. The animals have roamed wild in the Forest of Dean in 2004, after a 700 year absence. They started to populate the wild in 1999 after several escaped from a farm and in 2004 a group of 60 were dumped - further boosting wild populations. Since then the population has grown steadily - with complaints about them digging up graveyards, gardens and grass verges. Farming of wild boar in Britain became fashionable in the 1970s and boar originating from the European mainland were kept under the Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976.","Raymond Green was killed when he crashed into a wild boar on the M4 .

"SpaceX successfully launched supplies to the International Space Station early Saturday morning, but fell short of its goal of recovering the rocket's leftover components for later reuse. The company's billionaire founder Elon Musk said the first-stage of the unmanned Falcon rocket made it to the platform floating a couple hundred miles off Florida's northeastern coast. The booster came down too hard and broke apart, he said. Scroll down for video . Liftoff: SpaceX successfully launched a supply rocket to the International Space Station on Saturday, the sixth mission by the aerospace contractor to the station since 2012 . 'Close, but no cigar this time,' Musk tweeted. He said it bodes well for the future, though. It was the first time anyone tried anything like this. Musk maintains that recovering and reusing rockets is essential for bringing down launch costs and speeding up operations. The primary mission for SpaceX was delivering more than 5,000 pounds of supplies ordered up by NASA, including hasty replacements for experiments and equipment lost in the destruction of another company's cargo ship last fall, as well as extra groceries. Belated Christmas presents were also on board for the six space station astronauts. 'Hurrah! A (hash)Dragon is coming to visit bringing gifts,' Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti said in a tweet from orbit. Without interfering with the $133million delivery, Musk had fins for guidance and landing legs installed on the first stage of the rocket, and positioned a modified barge off the coast of Jacksonville. Recovery: A barge floating off the coast of Jacksonville, Florida, was supposed to recover the leftover booster, but components came down too hard and broke apart, according to SpaceX founder Elon Musk . Brilliant: Onlookers and photographers watched the trajectory of the Falcon 9 rocket, which lit up the sky over Cape Canaveral, Florida . Lit up: The sky over Cape Canaveral Air Force Station was illuminated early Saturday morning after a successful liftoff . Rendezvous: The boosters later separated from the upper stage of the rocket, which continued its path towards the space station . No cigar: Musk was optimistic on Twitter in spite of the crash, especially considering the feat had never before been attempted in the history of space flight . A ship with SpaceX staff watched from a safe 10 miles away as the 14-story booster approached the platform, marked with a giant X. Musk reported that the platform itself - 300 feet by 100 feet, with wings stretching the width to 170 feet - was fine following the attempted touchdown well before dawn. But he said some of the equipment on deck will need to be replaced. There ended up being no good video of the 'landing/impact,' he said in a tweet, noting it was 'pitch dark and foggy' out in the ocean. 'Will piece it together from telemetry and ... actual pieces,' he said. Brief TV images from booster cameras, broadcast by NASA, showed water bubbles. In the weeks preceding the landing test, Musk had estimated there was a 50-50 chance, at best, that the Falcon's first-stage booster would land vertically on the platform. A pair of attempts last year to bring boosters down vertically on the open ocean went well, but company officials conceded before Saturday's try that a platform touchdown was considerably more challenging. Once separated from the upper stage of the rocket Saturday, the main booster re-ignited as planned for the flyback, according to SpaceX. Automatic engine firings maneuvered the booster down toward the autonomous, modified barge. The Air Force maintained the ability, as always, to destroy the booster if it strayed off course. NASA watched the post-launch drama with keen interest, but its biggest focus was on the Dragon racing toward the space station. The capsule is due to arrive there Monday. The shipment - the sixth by SpaceX since 2012 - is needed more than usual because of the recent loss of another company's supply ship. Orbital Sciences Corp's Antares rocket exploded seconds after liftoff in October, destroying the entire payload and damaging the Virginia launch complex. That rocket is grounded until next year. This SpaceX delivery was supposed to occur before Christmas, but was delayed by a flawed test-firing of the rocket. Then a problem with the rocket's steering system cropped up at the last minute during Tuesday's initial launch attempt. NASA is paying SpaceX and Orbital Sciences to keep the space station stocked in the wake of the retired shuttle program. The $1.6billion contract with SpaceX calls for 12 flights; the $1.9billion contract with Orbital calls for eight. SpaceX also returns items to Earth; Orbital cannot. Russia and Japan will make their own supply runs this year. SpaceX, headquartered in Hawthorne, California, also has been contracted by NASA to develop beefed-up Dragons for astronaut rides to the space station, beginning as early as 2017. Boeing also is hard at work on a manned capsule. In the meantime, NASA is paying tens of millions of dollars to Russia for each US astronaut launched aboard the Soyuz spacecraft.","The aerospace transportation contractor planned to land the rocket's booster on a barge, but the booster came down too fast and broke apart .

"An eccentric filmmaker who once held a lecturer position at MIT allegedly robbed a New York bank on New Year's Eve while filming the heist and said he did it for art's sake. The New York Post reports that Joseph Gibbons, 61, was charged with robbery on Friday after taking $1,000 from a Capital One bank in downtown Manhattan. According to court documents, Gibbons walked into a branch on Bowery and Grand Street armed with a camcorder. Hold up: A former MIT professor who was charged with robbery after taking $1000 from a Manhattan bank allegedly told another man waiting to be charged he did it as research for a film . He handed the bank teller a note, which asked for a donation to be made to his church, according to documents filed in court. Rhode Island police believe that the former professor, who currently lives in a Boston suburb, is responsible for a similar heist at a bank in Providence. According to the Providence Journal, a middle-aged man robbed a Citizens Bank in November, telling the clerk who handed over $3,000, 'Thank you, this is for the church.' The Post reports that while waiting to be arraigned for the incident on New Year's Eve, Gibbons told another man who was locked up the inspiration for the robberies. 'He was doing research for a film,' said 27-year-old Kaylan Sherrard. 'It’s not a crime; it’s artwork… He’s an intellectual.' In the past, Gibbons said he tried to cultivate a drug habit as research for a couple of his short films. 'I was involved with all this as research,' he told art magazine Big Red and Shiny. 'The romantic idea of the artist getting involved in these kinds of activities as a kind of research, gaining experience.' Professor: 61-year-old Joseph Gibbons was charged Friday for the New Year's Eve heist, though he is also sought in connection to another robbery in Rhode Island . The artist: A still from Confessions of a Sociopath Part 1 shows Gibbons in the role that helped him achieve notoriety in the art world . According to Gibbons's LinkedIn profile, he was a visiting artist at Bard College for three months in 1990, and later took a lecturer position at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Though as of Saturday, a page for Joe Gibbons on MIT's Program in Art, Culture and Technology turned up a dead link, an earlier version of the site shows Joe Gibbons was a lecturer there from 2002 to 2010. A biography on that page states Gibbons's work has been exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art and Whitney Museum in New York, the Centre Pompidou in Paris and the Reina Sofia in Madrid. It also notes that his 2002 film 'Confessions of a Sociopath' was considered among the Best Films of the Year by Artforum magazine. An email sent to an address attributed to Gibbons was not returned.","Filmmaker Joseph Gibbons, 61, was charged with robbery on Friday .

"Two were arrested on Dick Cheney's lawn as dozens gathered outside the former vice president's home to protest torture on Saturday. The crowd of 20 demonstrators was there to mark the 13th anniversary of the opening of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp and protest the torture of detainees held by the United States. The protesters, some clad in orange jumpsuits reminiscent of those worn by inmates at Guantanamo, along with black hoods, walked across the snow-covered lawn of Cheney's home in McLean, Virginia. Scroll down for video . Protest: A crowd of 20 demonstrators gathered at Dick Cheney's home on the 14th anniversary of the opening of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp to protest the torture of detainees held by the United States . Code Pink, the group organizing the demonstration, also had members in front of the home of CIA Director John Brennan, calling it their 'Guantanamo Anniversary Weekend Torturers Tour.' A 6,000-page report from the US Senate released last month detailed how the CIA misled the White House and public about the detention and torture of prisoners held as part of the War on Terror. The report included instances of 'rectal feeding' and 'rectal rehydration,' and said in some cases detainees were kept awake for up to a week. On Fox News, Cheney called the report 'full of crap' and 'deeply flawed,' though he admitted he had only 'seen parts' and 'read summaries.' He also defended the techniques used on detainees as 'successful.' 'The question is what are you prepared to do in order to get the truth about future attacks against the United States,' he said to Fox News host Bret Baier. This is in spite of findings in the report that showed torture techniques to be ineffective at creating actionable intelligence, and instead leading detainees to stop talking or fabricate information. Lineup: Protesters posed as Guantanamo detainees and held signs across from Cheney's home . Deeply flawed: Former vice president Cheney called the Senate report on torture 'full of crap' and claimed that torture was successful in stopped attacks on the US, though no evidence has yet been presented . The Guardian reports that Senator Dianne Feinstein claimed investigators could not find one instance where torture produced intelligence used to prevent future attacks that had not already been obtained through other means. The Senate report also found that at least 26 of the 119 prisoners believed to have been detained at Guantanamo were 'wrongfully held.' Fairfax County police spokesman Roger Henriquez said that police arrested two protesters who refused to leave the property after being asked to leave. Code Pink identified the two as Tighe Barry, 57, and Eve Tetaz, 83, and told Reuters they were unfairly singled out.","Two were arrested during a protest by Code Pink at the McLean, Virginia, home .

"Charged: This photo provided by the Baltimore Police Department shows Bishop Heather Cook.  Maryland's second-highest ranking Episcopal leader and the first female bishop in her diocese was charged with drunken driving and manslaughter after fatally striking a cyclist in late December . In a spectacular fall from grace, Maryland's second-highest ranking Episcopal leader and the first female bishop in her diocese was charged with drunken driving and manslaughter after fatally striking a cyclist in late December. Heather Cook, 58, turned herself in to authorities Friday, according to her attorney, David Irwin. Online court records show Cook's bail was set at $2.5 million. It was unclear late Friday whether she had posted bail. A trial is scheduled for February 6. The charges came less than a week after the national Episcopal Church announced it had opened an investigation into Cook, whose ties to the church span generations. On December 27, Cook struck and killed Tom Palermo, 41, while he was riding his bicycle. According to prosecutors, Cook left the scene for 30 minutes before returning, and registered a blood-alcohol content of .22 percent after the wreck. Palermo died of a head injury at a nearby hospital later that day. Less than four months earlier, Cook was ordained as the diocese of Maryland's first female bishop. She attended an Episcopal girls school and had served as a boarding school chaplain, an assistant at a parish in New York and a member of two diocesan staffs. Her father, also a priest, raised his family in the historic Old St. Paul's Episcopal Church rectory in downtown Baltimore. Too young: The victim was Tom Palermo, 41 - a Baltimore bicycle enthusiast who custom-made bike frames as part of his one-man business . Twisted metal: Palermo's wrecked bike is pictured here. He was left dying in the street for a time before a fellow cyclist happened by and called 911 . According to Cook's autobiographical statement, when Cook herself was ordained as a deacon, her father removed 'the stole from around his own neck and placed it over mine.' But Cook's father, like her, had a history of alcohol abuse. In 1977, the Rev. Halsey Cook told the Old St. Paul's congregation in a sermon that he was an alcoholic suffering a relapse and seeking treatment, calling alcoholism 'a rampant epidemic in our society' and a 'fatal disease, not only of the body but of the mind and spirit,' according to an article that year in The Baltimore Sun. Heather Cook, too, has had repeated problems with alcohol. In 2010, Cook was charged with drunken driving on Maryland's Eastern Shore after registering a blood alcohol content of .27 percent. Police found wine, liquor and marijuana in her car. The drug charges were dropped after Cook pleaded guilty to the drunken driving offense, and she received probation. Diocese of Maryland spokeswoman Sharon Tillman said those charges were disclosed to search committee members during a vetting process as the diocese searched for a new bishop. However, the information was not shared with those people - clergy and lay church members - who voted among four finalists. Following a complaint made last week, national church leaders decided to open an investigation to determine whether Cook violated church law in Palermo's death. Flowers and messages are shown at a small makeshift memorial at the scene of a fatal collision between a car and bicyclist along a Baltimore residential street with a bike lane . 'Tom was a passionate bicycle builder, a father, and a friend to many people who ride bicycles in Baltimore'While details of the crash are still emerging, we know the driver of the car involved initially fled the scene, leaving Tom to die on the street.' The Right Rev. Eugene Taylor Sutton, bishop of the diocese, said in a statement Friday that the community is 'heartbroken.' 'We cry for the Palermo family, our sister Heather and all in the community who are hurting,' Sutton said. The church investigation is separate from the criminal probe, which took nearly two weeks to produce charges. Antonio Gioia, the chief of the conviction-integrity unit for the office of Baltimore State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby, said Cook was not charged immediately to avoid the possibility of double jeopardy. If Cook had been given a traffic ticket, that might have prevented prosecutors from filing additional, more serious charges. 'It behooves us to take our time and get it right,' Gioia said. A community mourns: A mourner places flowers at a makeshift memorial created for Palermo. Baltimore's active cycling community reacted quickly and vocally to the tragedy . Prosecutors say Cook was texting on her cellphone when she veered and struck Palermo from behind in a residential neighborhood in northern Baltimore. The impact threw him onto the car's hood and windshield, and he landed on a curb. Mosby said Cook went to her nearby home before returning. After she was taken to a police station, Cook was given a breath test, according to charging documents. In addition to felony vehicular manslaughter, Cook was charged with criminal negligent manslaughter, failure to remain at the scene of an accident resulting in serious injury and death, using a text messaging device that resulted in an accident and three drunken driving charges. If convicted of all charges, Cook could face more than 20 years in prison.","Bishop Heather Cook turned herself into authorities on Friday and her charged with manslaughter and drunk driving .

"Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe has been told he could lose what remains of his sight within a year . Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe has been told he could lose what remains of his sight within a year. The murderer, who is already blind in one eye after a prison attack, was said to be 'extremely upset' when he was told he has a severe condition linked to diabetes. Sutcliffe, who killed 13 women and tried to murder seven others between 1975 and 1980, refused laser eye surgery as he fears it could cause him to lose his vision immediately. The killer is devastated that he may soon be unable to watch television, read books and write letters, The Sun reported. The 68-year-old, who is serving 20 life sentences at high-security psychiatric hospital Broadmoor, told a friend: 'I am terrified and just don't know how I will spend my time.' Sutcliffe, who notoriously targeted prostitutes during his five-year killing spree, had an eye check in recent weeks following a prolonged period of poor health. He had a hernia operation in 2013 and has since been suffering from a debilitating cough. He has been taking medication which has made him put on weight and has increased his blood pressure. In December he suffered an attack of angina. The Yorkshire Ripper was told he has damaged blood vessels in his retina and that the condition of his eye has deteriorated because of his diabetic retinopathy - which can lead to blindness. A friend of the killer is reported to have said: 'It is playing on his mind a lot and he is very upset.' Sutcliffe lost vision in his left eye after a fellow inmate attacked him with a pen in 1997 - an attack which also damaged his right eye. He was attacked again in 2007 by another killer, Patrick Sureda, who stabbed him in the face with a blunt seven-inch knife. During the attack, Sureda shouted: 'I'll teach you, you b******, for killing all those women.' Broadmoor Hospital did not comment on Sutcliffe's condition. Sutcliffe, who killed 13 women and tried to murder seven others between 1975 and 1980, is being held at Broadmoor Hospital (pictured) It costs taxpayers more than £300,000 to detain him in Broadmoor, at least five times more than the cost of a prison cell. The murderer will see out the rest of his life at the hospital, with a plea to move to a facility 170 miles north - in Yorkshire - rejected in December. He wanted to be closer to his family but a senior doctor there was 'no change' in Sutcliffe's condition and that he could not be moved to a lower security 65-bed unit attached to Fieldhead Hospital in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. The move would have placed him just a few miles from where he murdered his victims.","Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe could lose his sight within a year .

"When it comes to beating the buzzer, this is a near-impossible move. During the Utah Jazz’s Friday night game against the Oklahoma City Thunder, Trevor Booker managed to do something that has been called everything from a 'circus shot' to 'the craziest thing of the NBA season'. With only 0.2 seconds left on the clock, Booker executed an over-the-head slap of the ball with two hands that landed with a swish, in what will undoubtedly become the basket of the year. Making the move even more incredible is that NBA rules require 0.3 seconds to complete a full catch and shooting motion, so any shot Booker made at the time had to be a tap.

"Married couples are happier than single people, especially those who say they married their best friend, says a new study. Married couples enjoyed both a honeymoon period of the first year or two after the wedding as well as being supported against stress from work pressure and looking after children or aging parents. The National Bureau of Economic Research in Canada used data for the report from the British Household Panel Survey, the United Kingdom's Annual Population, and the Gallup World Poll. Married couples are happier than single people, especially those who say they married their best friend, says a new study. 'There's a lot of stress going on in middle age,' said Department of Finance Canada a researcher Shawn Grover in an interview with The Huffington Post. 'Having someone to talk that out with and having someone to support you in those difficult times can help explain why it's a bit harder for people without a partner.' Those who saw their partner as their 'best friend' reported the highest happiness levels. Researches note that that fell in line with thinking that close relationships were necessary for long term well being. Researches note that that fell in line with thinking that close relationships were necessary for long term well being . Dr. Bella DePaulo said long-term platonic friendships can offer their own form of happiness and said such studies often don't take divorces into account. 'Plus, the people who got married chose to marry,' DePaulo said about the new findings in an email to The Huffington Post. 'For people like me who are single at heart, getting married may not have the same implications as it does for the kinds of people who want to marry and choose to do so.' The findings use aggregated data meaning they don't necessarily apply to everyone but are a good guide of the average person's experience . Long-term partners who co-habitated were about as happy as the ones who were legally married. 'We do think it's more about that social relationship than the legal status,' Grover said. 'Marriage, in a sense, is a super friendship.'

"Debts: Anita Harris has worked tirelessly in recent years to overcome her financial woes . She was once one of Britain’s highest paid stars with a glittering career that included hit records, starring roles in the West End and even a cabaret spot in Las Vegas. But now actress Anita Harris has been declared bankrupt because of tens of thousands of pounds in unpaid taxes. The Mail on Sunday can reveal that both Harris and her TV director husband Michael Margolis had a bankruptcy petition filed against them by the taxman at Kingston upon Thames County Court. Sources say that Harris owed in excess of £14,000, while Margolis had personal liabilities of just over £25,000. The bankruptcy, which is detailed in records seen by The Mail on Sunday, is the latest humiliation for the star, who has been plagued by financial woes. In 1985 she was forced to rebuild her career after the collapse of a Swiss bank cost the couple £1 million as well as their luxury London home. The pair soon re-established a comfortable lifestyle thanks in part to Harris’s role in the West End musical Cats, and in 1991 they bought a new home in Barnes, South-West London. But in 2007 they were forced to sell the property to settle a string of debts, and two years later were evicted from a flat after failing to pay seven months’ rent. Harris, 72, shot to fame as a singer in the 1960s before landing starring roles in movies including two Carry On films. She also established herself as a cabaret star, and by the 1970s was enjoying success in Las Vegas and at the prestigious Talk Of The Town nightclub in London. TV stardom quickly followed and she found herself co-hosting the popular David Nixon Magic Show. In recent years Harris, who now lives in a ramshackle rented cottage in Surrey, has thrown herself into work in an effort to remain solvent. She has just finished panto in York and is on a nationwide tour. In march she will make an appearance on BBC drama Casualty. Last night her promoter Peter Gill said he had no idea if the star had been declared bankrupt. He said: ‘I really can’t comment because I really don’t know. As far as I am concerned she’s very busy and doing very well.’ A spokesman for the Insolvency Service said: ‘The bankruptcy petition against Anita Harris and Michael Margolis was filed by solicitors acting on behalf of HMRC. We cannot give details of the amounts owed to anyone who is not a creditor.’ Both Harris and Margolis were unavailable for comment when The Mail on Sunday visited their home.

"Authorities on Friday released a composite sketch of the man they believe detonated an explosive near the offices of the Colorado Springs chapter of the NAACP. The FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms also offered a $10,000 reward for information on Tuesday's explosion, which caused only minor damage and no injuries but rattled nerves due to its proximity to the nation's oldest civil rights organization. Federal officials say they do not know whether the NAACP was targeted but are investigating the explosion as a possible hate crime. FBI spokeswoman Amy Sanders holds up a sketch of a person of interest in the bombing of the Colorado Springs chapter of the NAACP after a press conference with local and national law enforcement agencies . FBI Special Agent in Charge Thomas Ravenelle said authorities drew the sketch of a bald white man with sunglasses based on accounts of witnesses who saw him place a device behind the building that houses the NAACP and a black-owned barbershop. The man returned to his truck and left as the device detonated. Ravenelle said there were no threats to the NAACP in the weeks before the bombing. ""Only the bomber knows why he put this there,"" he said. The crude device failed to ignite a canister of gasoline placed next to it, but Ravenelle said even if it had succeeded it probably would have only caused minor damage. He said that doesn't undermine the seriousness of the crime, however. FBI Special Agent in Charge Thomas Ravenelle leads a press conference with local and national law enforcement agencies to address new developments in the bombing of the Colorado Springs chapter of the NAACP . Colorado Springs police said they were stepping up patrols in the area. Staff members at a Colorado NAACP office say they are waiting for more information before drawing conclusions about an explosion near their chapter, even as the FBI investigates whether the blast was domestic terrorism. ""We're standing vigilant and are trying not to let this disrupt anything,"" Colorado Springs NAACP volunteer Harry Leroy said Wednesday, a day after someone set off a homemade explosive device outside the group's building, about an hour south of Denver. The FBI said it had not determined whether the nation's oldest civil rights organization was targeted. ""We're exploring any potential motive, and domestic terrorism is certainly one among many possibilities,"" Denver FBI spokeswoman Amy Sanders said. Authorities planned to share more details about their investigation at a news conference Friday afternoon. This Jauary 6, 2015 photo shows at the bottom right the char marks from a device detonated Tuesday along the northeast corner of a building occupied by a barber shop near the Colorado Springs chapter of the NAACP in Colorado Springs . Colorado Springs police officers investigate the scene of the explosion on Tuesday in Colorado Springs . An improvised explosive device was detonated about 11 a.m. Tuesday outside a barbershop that shares a building with the NAACP chapter, but a gasoline canister placed next to the device failed to ignite. There were no injuries and only minor damage to the low-slung building, which sits in a mostly residential neighborhood. Speculation swept across social media about whether the explosion was a hate crime. Investigators have not ruled out any possibilities, and members of the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force are investigating because of the explosion's proximity to the NAACP office, Sanders said. Investigators apparently have few leads. They are looking for a person of interest — a balding white man in his 40s who might be driving a dirty pickup truck. In a joint statement Thursday, local law enforcement and Colorado Springs NAACP President Henry Allen Jr. said the case was a high priority and that tips from the public provided the best hope of figuring out who was responsible. Authorities are investigating whether a homemade explosive set off outside the building that houses a barber shop and the Colorado Springs chapter of the NAACP was aimed at the nation's oldest civil rights organization . ""Regardless of if this act is determined to be a bias motivated crime, the law enforcement community in El Paso County does not condone this or any act of violence,"" it said. Both the office and the barbershop reopened Wednesday with little police presence. Gene Southerland owns Mr. G's Hair Design Studios next door and was cutting a client's hair there when the explosion occurred. The blast was strong enough to knock items off the walls, but the quick police response was comforting, he said. Southerland said the FBI had given him no information on its early findings but said he didn't believe the barbershop or its predominantly black clientele was targeted. Leroy, the NAACP volunteer, said he believed there were surveillance cameras behind the building, but he did not know whether they captured anything of value. Gregory Alan Johnson, who lives nearby, said he was unaware of any prior problems near the NAACP offices. Colorado Springs Lt. Catherine Buckley said the department found nothing concerning in any previous calls for service. Those who heard the blast, including Southerland, said it sounded like a single, loud ""boom.""","Blast hit near the Colorado Springs chapter of the NAACP .

"Jane Seymour as Michaela Mike in the television series Dr Quinn set in Colorado Springs . Since I turned 60 last year, a funny thing has started to happen to my emails. I write January when I mean September or use a word that looks like the one I intended but isn't. I struggle to stay focused on work and my memory just isn't what it used to be. It’s troubling, and I’m sure I can count myself among the legions of middle-aged worried well, silently fearing our minds may go years before our bodies. So please forgive my suspension of disbelief when I was invited to try out a US-based spa that claims to be able to ‘anti-age’ the mind, rather than simply pampering the body. Never mind it has a Director of Spirituality on its staff. Nor that it offers ‘healing therapy with horses’. It also has an ex-US Surgeon General on the board, and the plan promises ‘a better brain in 30 days’. The idea of a magic formula to help stave off dementia is irresistible – even if it may mean cutting through a sea of American psychobabble. WHERE’S THE SOLUTION? Canyon Ranch was opened 35 years ago in Tucson, Arizona, by a couple determined to embrace New Age therapies as well as Western science. It will be familiar to cruise-ship fans, as there are branches on Cunard’s Queen Mary 2 as well as the liners of Oceania, Regent Seven Seas and Celebrity Cruises. It attracts a slew of well-heeled workaholics and the odd celebrity, including Mad Men’s January Jones, Strictly winner Caroline Flack and Jane Seymour, who famously played Dr Quinn, Medicine Woman. WHAT’S THE TREATMENT? The Brain Health and Longevity Programme is delivered over six days. First, former US Surgeon General Dr Richard Carmona delivers some great news: our brains may be shrinking but they are endlessly malleable, capable of building new cells at any age in response to new experiences. This ‘neuroplasticity’ is bolstered by correct nutrition (Alzheimer’s disease is now called type 3 diabetes in the US because it’s so closely connected with poor sugar metabolism), deeper sleep and regular exercise. After this comes the unexpected shock of high-intensity interval training in the gym – Dr Carmona says vigorous exercise is vital to get blood flowing to the ageing brain before we put it to the test. Spurred to go hell for leather on the treadmill for 30 seconds at a time, we all agree we feel fantastic afterwards. I rise at 6.30am the next day for a desert hike. I need a double espresso to make it to the starting point but feel proud of managing two miles before breakfast. This becomes a daily habit, like the yoga classes and meditation. Animal therapy is well known to reduce blood pressure and stress and increase self-esteem – and a particularly powerful effect has been observed when a variety of patients interact with horses. This is why neurosurgeon Dr Allan Hamilton and his psychotherapist wife Jane offer equine-assisted therapy – at £270-plus for a three-hour session, although the cost can be covered by a £800 treatment allowance which is included in the price of a stay. It’s one of the optional extras the brain-raddled might find useful to help ‘quiet their minds’ (one of the Big Ideas we are exhorted to adopt) but involves no horseback riding. Instead, we spend the session getting a horse to obey our simple commands. Canyon Ranch was opened 35 years ago in Tucson, Arizona, by a couple determined to embrace New Age therapies as well as Western science . They are such big, powerful animals, it takes a lot of attention to try to get their trust and overcome the fear of being stepped on – a meditation in itself and a shining example of the power of focus. It’s a shame the horses are several miles away on the Hamiltons’ ranch, and that working with them is so expensive. THE VERDICT? It’s hard not to feel better after several days in a sublime location, breathing fresh air and eating tasty organic food in an alcohol-free environment. I’ve managed three gym visits a week since returning, for the first time working up a sweat thanks to high-intensity training. At the ranch, Spiritual Wellness Director Julie Haber told me to create ‘a sacred space’ at home – a comfortable corner to retreat to with candles and cushions when I need to get my mojo back. Well, I have not yet decluttered or knowingly meditated, but now that I think about it I’m not feeling as scatty, forgetful or stressed and I think the exercise must have a lot to do with that. I’m still making those inadvertent typos, though – but I have been reassured by experts this is a common sign of ageing, not a predictor of serious mental decline.

Hot cuppa worsens hot flushes . Hot flushes are one of the most dreaded symptoms of the menopause. Now new medical research has confirmed what many women have suspected all along: that a morning cup of coffee can make them worse. Experts at the Mayo Clinic in the United States found that 85 per cent of women who suffered hot flushes also consumed high amounts of caffeine in tea, coffee and fizzy drinks. Do you know your glutes from your elbow? If so, you are in the minority as a new study has revealed that three out of four Britons have little or no idea what muscle groups they are working during exercise. A survey of 2,000 adults by Virgin Active gyms found 50 per cent don’t know what their triceps are, and almost a tenth of people wrongly believe the glutes are found in the stomach, not their bottom. Londoners proved the most knowledgeable when it came to locating basic muscle groups, while people from the West Midlands fared the worst. Experts at Coventry University have designed a phone app that offers advice to people on how to prevent falls at home. Fallcheck provides information on potential hazards alongside tips on how to stop accidents happening, such as removing a rug. About a third of people aged 65 and over suffer at least one fall a year. PREVENT . ‘If your throat starts to feel sore, take it easy to allow your immune system time to deal with it,’ advises Luke Cascarini, consultant oral and maxillofacial surgeon at BMI The Sloane Hospital and head and neck surgeon at Guy’s Hospital in London. ‘Eat healthily, stay well hydrated and avoid late nights and shift work. If you are on an extreme exercise programme, such as training for a marathon, give it a rest till you feel better as overdoing it may suppress your immune system.’ TREAT . Painkillers and plenty of fluids are the first line of treatment before heading to the GP, says Mr Cascarini. ‘Don’t be tempted to head straight to the doctors to get signed off work. Paracetamol will ease the pain and also help reduce a high temperature. You’d be amazed how many people refuse to take basic painkillers – but think of it as being thirsty and not drinking water.’ A sore throat should pass in three to seven days. And even if you do decide to make a GP appointment, it’s unlikely you’ll be given antibiotics. This is because most sore throats are not caused by bacteria, so antibiotics will have little effect. DON’T BOTHER . Although hot toddies are seen as a warming, grown-up alternative to traditional over-the-counter sore-throat remedies, Mr Cascarini warns that they could end up doing you more harm than good. ‘Alcohol dehydrates you and drinking anything too hot could irritate your throat, so you could end up feeling worse, not better,’ he says.","Canyon Ranch in Tucson, Arizona, offers equine therapy for £270 .

"It has been revealed that one of the four victims of the Kosher supermarket killings in Paris, Yoav Hattab, was the son of the Chief Rabbi of Tunis and director of the Jewish School, Benjamin Hattab. The 21-year-old, from La Goulette, a coastal town in the suburbs of Tunis had moved to Paris to study marketing and international trade. Yohan Cohen, 22, Philippe Braham, in his forties, and François-Michel Saada, thought to be in his sixties, were also murdered in the attack, French Jewish organisation Crif confirmed. It has been revealed that one of the four victims of Friday's Kosher supermarket killings, Yoav Hattab, 21 (pictured) is the son of the Chief Rabbi of Tunis and director of the Jewish School, Benjamin Hattab . It emerged today that Mr Hattab passed his baccalaureate at the Tunis French lycee, and augmented his studies working as a small business sales manager. Living near Vincennes his family knew he always visited the Kosher deli for the Sabbath but had hoped he had escaped the carnage. So far Tunisian authorities have remained silent on the murder. Yamina Thabet, president of the Tunisian Association representing minorities, denounced the ‘incredible silence of Tunisian authorities.’ ‘Apart from the Islamist movement Ennahda who presented their condolences, no politician has yet commented on the death of the Tunisian citizen.’ All four men were murdered on Friday by Islamic terrorist Amedy Coulibaly, including one who is said to have snatched one of the extremist's guns and turned it on the hostage taker - only to find that the weapon had jammed. 21-year-old Mr Hattab, from La Goulette, a coastal town in the suburbs of Tunis had moved to Paris to study marketing and international trade and often visited the Kosher deli the day before the Sabbath . The dramatic account was revealed by a survivor who fled the shoot-out as armed police officers and soldiers raided the store yesterday. Mickael B, as he wishes to be known, was held in the store with his three-year-old son when the fellow hostage suddenly grabbed the weapon which had been left on the counter and tried to fire it at terrorist Amedy Coulibaly. But, after discovering the gun had been left there because it was malfunctioning, the extremist shot and killed the heroic hostage. Giving a terrifying account, Mickael said: 'I was heading for the check-out with the goods in my hand when I heard a bang – very loud. I thought it was a firecracker at first. But turning I saw a black man armed with two Kalashnikov rifles and I knew what was happening.' 'I grabbed my son by the collar and fled to the back of the store. There, with other customers, we ran down a spiral staircase into the basement. We all piled into one of two cold rooms – our door wouldn't close. We were terrified.

Two police officers stand guard outside the Kosher supermarket in Paris, a day after the bloody siege . Candles and flowers form a makeshift memorial outside the Kosher store where the four hostages died . 'Five minutes later a store employee was sent down by the killer. She said he said we were to go back up otherwise there'd be carnage. I refused to go up. 'By now my son, understanding nothing, was panicking. Then minutes later the employee comes back down with the same message. This time I decided to follow her up the spiral staircase. 'At the top a man was dying in a pool of his own blood. The terrorist introduced himself to us. He was strangely calm. 'I am Amedi Coulibaly, Malian and Muslim. I belong to the Islamic State,' he told us.' 'Then he told us to put our phones on the ground. He walked around the store, armed, totally justifying himself, speaking of Palestine, French prisons, his brothers in Syria and many other things. 'Suddenly one of the customers tried to grab one of his guns which he'd left on the counter. It wasn't working. The terrorist had put it there because it had blocked after the first shots,' Mickael told Le Point. 'He turned and shot at the customer who died on the spot.' Mickael added: 'He then demanded that I call the media, which I did. From then on the phone in the store never stopped ringing. It was mainly journalists. 'I told them now was not the time. My son started to cry he wanted to go home. He said the terrorist was a bad man. A young boy places flowers outside the Hyper Cacher Kosher supermarket in eastern Paris today . 'I managed to get my phone out discreetly and got in touch with the police outside while the terrorist was roaming the aisles. 'A policeman told me that we should be ready to throw ourselves flat on the ground when the assault came, which would be soon. 'It was obvious that the terrorist was preparing to die. He said it was his reward. He had a weapon in each hand and boxes of cartridges nearby. He suddenly began to pray. 'My mobile was still on. The police had heard it all. Minutes later the shop grille was lifted. We knew it was the start of the assault. 'We flung ourselves to the ground. The noise was deafening. He was dead. It was over.' A young Malian Muslim who was working in the supermarket when it was raided has hailed as a 'hero' after it was revealed that he led Jewish customers away from the terrorist to safety in the kosher store. Lassana Bathily, 24, helped up to 15 people to take shelter in the store's walk in freezer. French police named the hostage taker as Amedy Coulibaly (right). Police also named Hayat Boumeddiene (left) as helping him. However, it is no longer clear whether she was involved amid reports she is in Syria . 'I opened the door and told a number of people to get in there. I turned off the light, turned off the freezer and closed the door,' he said. 'I told them, stay calm I am going out.' Using a goods lift he escaped and was able to give the police valuable information about what was happening inside and where the hostages were hiding. Shy and reluctant to tell his story he admitted that after the shoot-out many of the customers came to shake his hand and thank him for what he did. Today his picture – labelled Malian Muslim – has been tweeted around the world as a symbol of the good of people united against terrorism. Questions were asked today of how the Charlie Hebdo shooters had been able to carry out the attacks. Both the Kouachi brothers are understood to have been on British and American terror watch lists. Dramatic footage has emerged of the moment police stormed in to the Paris kosher supermarket last night before terrorist Amedy Coulibaly was shot dead. Commandos launched flash grenades into the grocery and fired into the shop before a man believed to be the hostage taker was gunned down. Moments later, terrified captives could be seen running to safety. Forensic police officers stand by the body of Coulibaly outside the Kosher supermarket following the siege . It comes as it was revealed that the Isis fanatic had slaughtered four hostages before officers launched the raid. Last night, chilling images emerged of bodies lying on the floor of the bullet-ridden shop after several shoppers were taken hostage inside the grocery store - including women and children. Further images emerged of Coulibaly's bloodied body lying on a pavement after the siege had come to a dramatic end. It has also been revealed there were 500 calls made between the phone belonging to Coulibaly's wife Hayat Boumeddiene and a phone belonging to one of the wives of the Kouachi brothers. Boumeddiene, France's most wanted woman, is now in Syria after crossing the Turkish border earlier this month.","Yoav Hattab was one of victims of the Kosher grocery store siege in Paris .

The phrase has also become a defiant statement in the wake of what is being described as an attack on the freedom of expression by Islamist extremists. The magazine has in the past published satirical cartoons, often vulgar, mocking political and religious figures that include the Prophet Mohammed. A senior cleric of AQAP, a branch of al Qaeda, praised the act in a recording posted to Twitter on Friday, attacking the French and saying the gunmen had 'taught them a lesson and the limits of freedom of speech.' The speech from the group's senior cleric Sheikh Harith al-Nadhari came shortly after a statement was released from AQAP claiming responsibility for 'directing' the attack. Response: A heat map shows the users tweeting the hashtag, which has also become a message of defiance as Islamist extremist group AQAP says the attack would teach the 'limits of freedom of speech' Solidarity: Joachim Roncin, artistic director for Stylist magazine, designed this illustration, which has spread through social networks .

"With its blend of old and modern architecture, Castle Keep really is a tale of two centuries. It started out at the end of the 18th Century as a folly designed by architect James Wyatt, but was given a new lease of life 30 years ago by Italian artist and property developer Michele Bacciottini, who built its large extension. The result is a unique property that is part castle, part modern eco-home. Along with its tower and ‘living wall’, it also has a roof garden and a secret door leading to a spiral staircase. Graham Porter, 44, who lives in the unique home with his girlfriend Rebecca, 43, bought it for £990,000 in May 2012 after only one viewing. Scroll down for video . A home of two halves: Graham and Rebecca outside the unique property Castle Keep with its living wall . ‘It was certainly different from all the houses we’d seen at the time,’ says Graham, who owns an IT business. ‘Who’d have thought we’d end up living in a castle, especially as we weren’t particularly looking for one, although I have always been fascinated by them.’ When the folly was built, it was in the grounds of the mansion that would later become the prestigious Wycombe Abbey girls’ school, in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. When Graham first saw the property, it required some renovation, but he could see the potential. ‘I knew immediately that I wanted it and we moved in after a couple of months – a lot quicker than we expected,’ he says. The spiral staircase is like something you’d expect to find in a Harry Potter movie. As we walk through the kitchen, Graham opens a secret door – the front of which is a spice rack – revealing the staircase, which is within the turret section of the house. The staircase automatically lights up as you enter. Graham behind the secret door which leads to a spiral staircase . At the top of the staircase is a terrace with views of surrounding woodland and, as the decking includes several glass panels, you feel as if you’re walking on air when you look down. Graham and Rebecca use the terrace for dining but also have planting boxes there. ‘We grow various herbs in each box and the one we normally grow chives in became a nesting area for a mallard, which produced ten beautiful ducklings,’ says Graham. The spiral staircase has access to all three floors of the house but the property also has another, solid oak staircase, stretching from ground floor to roof level. The house, which has four bedrooms and three bathrooms and is on the market for £1.25 million, is heavily insulated and has solar panels. There are also triple-glazed windows throughout the main property, with double glazing in the top turret windows and in the building’s conservatory. The large bespoke kitchen is modern with solid oak worktops, attractive stone floor and picture windows that overlook a pond surrounded by exotic foliage, including palms, ferns and bamboo. There is a meandering pebble water feature and duck house to add to the tranquil setting. ‘The pond attracts lots of species of birds and wildfowl and is a constant source of enjoyment to Rebecca and me as we love nature and wildlife,’ says Graham. Kitchen fittings that form part of the sale include a large American-style fridge, gas/electric range cooker, washing machine and dishwasher. ‘We love entertaining and the kitchen is perfect for dinner parties,’ says Graham. Another feature of Castle Keep is its 'living wall' which extends from the ground to the roof terrace (pictured) The main living room is light and airy, with a wood-burning stove. It backs on to the conservatory/dining room which has underfloor heating and overlooks the garden, which encircles the property. On one side of the garden is a large summerhouse that would make an ideal studio, office or gym in a relaxing and picturesque setting. Another attractive feature of Castle Keep is its vertical ‘living wall’, which extends from the ground to the roof terrace. Various species of bird nest in its abundance of flora and an irrigation system waters the plants. Close to Castle Keep is a park, which has a leisure centre and open-air pool, local cricket and tennis clubs, and woodland and river walks. ‘High Wycombe has a great range of shops and there are excellent schools in the area,’ says Graham. ‘Travel to London is also easy.’ The couple are hoping to move to East Sussex as they would like to have more land. ‘We’d also like a bigger pond, so we can enjoy our love of wildlife. However, we’ll be sad to leave the area and our lovely castle,’ says Graham.","Castle Keep began as an 18th Century folly designed by James Wyatt .

"A chief constable has sparked a furious debate by saying police should not have to deal with every missing person report or tackle drunk and violent patients in A&E. Lynne Owens, Chief Constable of Surrey, called on hospitals and care homes to tackle problems themselves rather than calling 999. She also said officers should not have to spend hours dealing with those threatening suicide simply because there is no separate emergency service for people suffering a mental health crisis. And she blasted shops and petrol stations for lax security that allows thieves to get away. Appeal: Chief Constable Lynne Owens sparked a furious debate by saying police should not have to deal with every missing person report or tackle drunk and violent patients in A&E . In an interview with The Mail on Sunday, Mrs Owens said the burden placed on police by other organisations prevents them fighting growing crimes such as online fraud and child abuse. As forces struggle to cope with ongoing budget cuts, she called on the public to say what they expect of slimmed-down forces. ‘It’s inevitable that the cuts will have operational consequences,’ she said. The police have had a 20 per cent budget reduction since the last Election in May 2010, leading to the loss of 15,000 frontline officers and the closure of stations. But Mrs Owens – a former Met Assistant Commissioner who was in charge of security for Prince William and Kate Middleton’s wedding – said that as the cuts bite, some types of crime are on the rise. She said public-sector bodies and private firms must stop relying so much on the police. ‘We are going to be smaller, and there are some areas where we need to grow, such as our response to dealing with paedophiles and online fraud,’ she said. ‘We are going to have to make choices in other areas. And it does mean we need other sectors to be held accountable for their core responsibilities.’ There had been a ‘huge increase’ in missing person reports, she said. In Surrey they rose from 1,158 to 1,648 in the past year. Some involved vulnerable children or elderly people with dementia, and a few would end up as murder inquiries. She called on hospitals and care homes to tackle problems like drunks  themselves rather than calling 999 . Mrs Owens said: ‘Hospitals, care homes and other agencies report people missing and there are questions about whether they should do more themselves before they call the police. She said hospitals were the most frequent callers to Surrey Police, followed by the ambulance service, usually reporting ‘violent people, drunk people or missing people’. But she said all these could be handled by in-house security. The College of Policing, the new professional body for the service, is looking nationally at the demands placed on police by other public-sector bodies. Its research is expected to show that some officers are spending up to eight hours with people suffering mental health problems while doctors assess them, and three-quarters of those taken to ‘places of safety’ are driven by police rather than paramedics. Mrs Owens, who spent New Year’s Eve on the front line with her officers, said that a fifth of calls that night were either people threatening to kill themselves or from worried relatives. She said: ‘The ambulance service is established to deal with physical health issues but there is no one agency that can respond to people with mental health issues.’ Mrs Owens is also against police locking up drunks, because it takes officers off the street to keep watch over them. She said: ‘I think there should be some funding from the licensing community, which makes huge profits from people who drink alcohol.’ She criticised shops for not investing enough in security to ‘design out crime’. And she thinks motorists should have to pay for petrol before filling up, so police do not have to chase those who drive off. Surrey Police have faced criticism for some of their spending, however. They spent £14 million over six years developing an IT system for criminal intelligence – then scrapped it.","Lynne Owens, Chief Constable of Surrey, called on hospitals and care homes to tackle problems themselves rather than calling 999 .

"A police investigation has been launched into former Australian elite swimming coach Greg Hodge after two women alleged he inappropriately touched them when they were teenagers. The pair came forward earlier this week and claimed the incidents happened while they were students at Sutherland's Aquadot Swim Club - where Mr Hodge was a coach, The Sunday Telegraph reported. Both incidents are alleged to have happened in the 1980s. Scroll down for video . Two teenagers have alleged former elite swim coach Greg Hodge inappropriately touched them in the 1980s . Mr Hodge, who was once an Olympic swim official, now owns The Swim Factory in Perth, Western Australia with his wife, Sue. The Swim Factory offers classes for babies through to children up to 12 years old. He is a former director of Swimming Australia, New South Wales Institute of Sport and Western Australia Institute of Sport. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Mr Hodge for a response in relation to these claims. A NSW Police spokeswoman has confirmed the two women's claims were being investigated. 'New South Wales police are investigating a number of reports,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'The investigation is in its infancy and police are assessing the information provided. 'New South Wales police will also urge anyone who believes they are a victim of a crime to report the matter to police who will investigate.' Mr Hodge now owns The Swim Factory in Perth, Western Australia with his wife, Sue . One of the women was aged 13 years when she alleges Mr Hodge touched her while she was being fitted into her new racing swimsuit. She claims he reached into the swimsuit under the guise he was ensuring it fit properly. Further, the woman claims Mr Hodge wandered into the female change rooms while she and her fellow swimmers - some also in their teenage years - were taking showers. The second woman said she was touched by Mr Hodge when she was 15 years old. It comes after the News Corp newspaper reported on allegations involving the swim teacher kissing a young female swimmer on the cheek at a meet. He previously denied there was anything inappropriate about the incident and said an investigation launched by Swimming Western Australia found he had not done anything wrong.","Greg Hodge has been accused of touching two teenagers in the 1980s .

"Newly elected Sri Lankan president Maithripala Sirisena has vowed to slash the power of his office, only stand for one term and has installed the opposition leader as his prime minister. In the first of a series of promised, Sirisena has pledged radically reform the nation's constitution and delegate much of the power amassed by his predecessor to his prime minister and parliament. Sirisena victory on Thursday was a shock when he defeated his former long-term ally Mahinda Rajapaksa. The former president had become increasingly unpopular with Sri Lanka's ethnic and religious minorities. Scroll down for video . Newly elected Sri Lankan president Maithripala Sirisena, centre, has vowed to slash his office's powers . Sri Lanka's majority Sinhalese population objected to the amount of power accrued by Rajapaksa's family. Addressing a large crowd in Colombo at his swearing in ceremony, Sirisena said: 'With this victory we will implement the 100-day program in our election manifesto.' Among the changes planned, Sirisena has pledged to return the country to a parliamentary system of government. Sirisena also promised that he would not run again for president. He thanked Rajapaksa for conceding defeat but called for future campaigns to be 'much more mature,' and blasted the state media for its coverage. He said: 'Even though they carried out character assassination and vilified me, I can say I had the maturity to bear it all as a result of my long political experience.' Sirisena took his oath with senior Supreme Court Justice Kanagasabapathy Sripavan, bypassing the country's chief justice, who was installed by Rajapaksa in a widely criticised move to expand his authority even more. Sirisena then swore in opposition leader Ranil Wickremesinghe as the prime minister. Sirisena immediately installed the leader of the opposition as his prime minister as part of his reform agenda . While Rajapaksa's campaign centered around his victory over the Tamil Tiger rebels in 2009 and his work rebuilding the country's infrastructure, Sirisena's focused on reining in the president's expanding powers. He also accused Rajapaksa of corruption, a charge the president denied. Rajapaksa's power grew immensely after he defeated the Tigers, using his huge popularity among the Sinhalese, many of whom hailed him as a king. He used his parliamentary majority to scrap a constitutional two-term limit for the president and gave himself the right to appoint many top officials. He also installed numerous relatives in top government positions, sidelining the party's old guard, which helped give rise to the revolt that brought Sirisena to power. One of Rajapaksa's brothers is a Cabinet minister, another is the speaker of Parliament and a third is the defense secretary. One of his sons is a member of Parliament and a nephew is a provincial chief minister. The diplomatic service was full of his relatives and friends. Sirisena received 51.2 per cent of the votes in Thursday's election and Rajapaksa got 47.5 per cent, said Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya. Jubilant supporters took to the streets of the Sri Lankan capital Colombo to celebrate the election result . Rajapaksa had conceded defeat and vacated his official residence early Friday morning, hours before the official announcement. Sirisena called on his supporters earlier Friday to remain peaceful in the wake of victory, telling them at a gathering at the Election Commission that they shouldn't 'even hurt anybody's feelings'. He added: 'The honour of this victory is in your peaceful conduct.' U.S. President Barack Obama praised the peaceful transfer of power and said the United States looked forward to deepening its ties with Sri Lanka. He said: 'Beyond the significance of this election to Sri Lanka, it is also a symbol of hope for those who support democracy all around the world. International and domestic monitors and observers were permitted to do their jobs. Sri Lankans from all segments of society cast their ballots peacefully, and the voice of the people was respected.' The spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general told reporters Friday that Ban Ki-moon 'congratulates the people of Sri Lanka on the successful conclusion of the presidential election, and welcomes the constitutional transfer of power.' Sirisena split from his former ally Mahinda Rajapaksa in November after a dispute over the way the former president appointed relations to senior government posts prompting concerns over corruption . Rajapaksa, who was first elected in 2005, had been widely expected to easily win his third term in office until Sirisena suddenly split away in November, gathering the support of other defecting lawmakers and many of the country's ethnic minorities, making the election a fierce political battle. Rajapaksa was still thought to be tough to beat because he controlled the state media and has immense financial resources and popularity among the Sinhala majority. But polling was notably strong in Tamil-dominated areas, where voting had been poor in previous elections. Many Tamils were believed to have voted heavily for Sirisena — not so much because they supported him but because they despised Rajapaksa so much. He not only crushed the Tamil Tiger rebellion but also largely ignored Tamil demands to heal the wounds of the fighting and years of ethnic divisions. Muslims, the second-largest ethnic minority, also appeared to have voted against Rajapaksa, who was accused of backing ultranationalist Buddhist groups and turning a blind eye on anti-Muslim violence last June. As for the country's Sinhalese, which make up about three-quarters of the population, Sirisena's entry into the race gave them another credible option if they wanted Sri Lanka to move in a different direction.","Maithripala Sirisena won Sri Lanka's presidential election on Thursday .

"Photographs of two of the Paris gunmen meeting with an Al Qaeda recruiter have emerged following the massacres in which 17 innocents lost their lives. The pictures show Djamel Beghal, 50, a former disciple of the hate clerics Abu Hamza and Abu Qatada, with kosher supermarket killer Amedy Coulibaly and Charlie Hedbo murderer Cherif  Kouachi. A police surveillance camera image shows Beghal and Cherif together in 2010, while another photograph shows Coulibaly pictured with the recruiter in France in 2012. Scroll down for video . Surveillance: A police picture shows Djamel Beghal (left) and Cherif Kourachi (right) together in 2010 . Deadly partners: Kosher supermarket killer Amedy Coulibaly (right) pictured with Djamel Beghal (left) Beghal, 50, is currently in prison in France facing charges of leading a terrorist organisation. He is known to have met with the gunmen and hosted on-the-run suspect Hayat Boumeddiene for ‘crossbow practice’ while he was under house arrest in France. Boumeddiene, the radicalised widow of Coublibaly, is now France's most wanted woman after she fled to Syria. She is now thought to be with her murderous Islamic State allies after fleeing the country. She was reported to have flown from Madrid to Istanbul on January 2, crossing the Turkish border into Syria on Thursday. This was the day after brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi, murdered 12 people at the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. Beghal and Cherif Kouachi, one of the brothers responsible for the Charlie Hebdo massacre, were on such good terms that intelligence officers saw them playing football together with two other terrorists . Charlie Hebdo murderers Said Kouachi and his brother Cherif met Djamel Beghal under house arrest . It was also the day her husband, Amedy Coulibaly, murdered a female police officer before shooting four hostages at a kosher delicatessen in Eastern Paris. The suggestion is that Boumeddiene knew the attacks were due to take place and fled. Beghal, a French citizen born in Algeria, lived in Britain during the late 1990s where he was a regular at Finsbury Park Mosque and came under the influence of Abu Hamza and Abu Qatada. But he later moved with his family to Afghanistan – allegedly because he was inspired by Qatada – and was arrested as a suspected terrorist just weeks before the 9/11 attacks and subsequently convicted in France for his links to Al Qaeda in 2005. After being arrested at Dubai Airport in 2001 for carrying a false passport, he was accused in court of adhering to Takfir wal Hijra - a secretive Islamic movement financed by Osama bin Laden. After serving half of a ten-year sentence, the French government were attempting to deport him to Algeria when he was rearrested in 2010 on fresh charges. Beghal, a French citizen born in Algeria, lived in Britain during the late 1990s where he was a regular at Finsbury Park Mosque (pictured) and came under the influence of Abu Hamza and Abu Qatada . Jailed: Beghal was jailed for ten years for terrorism offences and is banned from the UK . But Beghal came under fresh scrutiny last week as it emerged that Cherif, and Coulibaly and wife Boumeddiene, had all visited him in Murat, central France, while he was under house arrest. Today it was revealed Beghal's wife, Sylvie Beghal, 45, is appealing against her own terror conviction on human rights grounds. In a case that has already cost UK taxpayers tens of thousands of pounds, Mrs Beghal, who lives on benefits the UK, is seeking to overturn her conviction for refusing to co-operate with British police who were investigating her husband. French citizen Mrs Beghal and the couple’s four children still live in Leicester where she is awaiting judgment on her case after taking her appeal all the way to the Supreme Court. Three years ago she was arrested and charged after being stopped at a British airport, where she refused to answer questions about her husband. She pleaded guilty to at least one charge related to terror laws but later appealed against the conviction on human rights grounds. Husband and wife: French police named the hostage taker as Amedy Coulibaly, left, 32, but Boumeddiene, right, 26, is not thought to have been at his side at the time . Wanted: Hayat Boumeddiene, wife of the jihadi in Paris deli siege, posing with a lethal weapon in Murat, central France, in 2010 . When questioned later by police, Boumeddiene, photographed posing with weapons in a burka, said she and her husband had visited the convicted terrorist for ‘crossbow practice’. Officers also photographed Beghal playing football with Kouachi in 2010. A Finsbury Park Mosque spokesman said last week: ‘Any attempts to link our mosque to at least one of the men suspected of carrying out the attack are completely false. ‘We have no information about any connections he had with those who ran the mosque previously. ‘Anyone who visited Finsbury Park Mosque in any capacity prior to February 2005 did so under the previous management which was removed after a very public struggle against it.'","Beghal recruited Charlie Hedbo killer Cherif Kouachi  in prison .

"The amount of money donated to the Treasury to help pay off the national debt has doubled in a year – thanks to one bequest of £420,000. New figures from the Treasury show that nearly £800,000 was donated as gifts or bequests in the last financial year – up from £406,000 in 2012/13 – to help straighten out Britain's finances. This included a bequest from one individual of £420,576 – and another gift of just 78p. While these acts of largesse will have been appreciated by Chancellor George Osborne, they will have had virtually no impact on Britain's huge overdraft. The amount of money donated to the Treasury to help pay off the national debt has doubled in a year – thanks to one bequest of £420,000, pictured is David Cameron and Georgev Osborne at a Manchester conference . Official figures from the Office for National Statistics last month showed that by November 2014 Britain's public sector net debt had reached £1,457billion. Last night Lib Dem MP Norman Baker, who obtained the figures, said: 'It is encouraging that some have the sense of responsibility to help pay off the debt but it would be reduced much more quickly if some of the waste you see in government was eliminated.' A future Tory government would use part of a planned £23bn budget surplus by the end of the decade to fund the £7bn in tax cuts announced by David Cameron, the Chancellor confirmed. In a move to counter Labour claims that the Tories are pledging unfunded tax cuts, George Osborne  said his planned budget surplus would allow him to cut Britain's national debt and to reduce the tax burden. Speaking at a joint economic event in Manchester with Mr Cameron earlier this week, he said: 'I think it is perfectly consistent to have spending plans that deliver the surplus, that reduce the national debt and to deliver those tax cuts that we have promised the British people because they are all part of the long-term economic plan.' He has also accused Labour of planning a secret 'tax bombshell' which could add 3p to income tax or three percentage points to national insurance. The £23bn figure was an estimate by the Office for Budget of Responsibility of the impact of Osborne's fiscal plans in his autumn statement, which are designed to balance the overall budget by 2018.

"Police have launched an investigation into the senior NHS children’s brain doctor exposed last week by The Mail on Sunday for taking a cocktail of illegal drugs just before going on duty. An hour after Dr Colin Ferrie was filmed snorting cocaine with an acquaintance and taking the powerful sedative and date-rape drug GHB, the hospital where he works confirmed he was on call for his vulnerable young patients. Last night West Yorkshire Police said that the same officers who investigated shamed Co-op Bank boss the Reverend Paul Flowers –who has since been prosecuted for his drug use – would be handling the inquiry. Dangerous habit: The damning text messages between Dr Ferrie and a friend, which date from May last year . A spokesman said: ‘West Yorkshire Police is now conducting an investigation into potential drugs offences following an article in a national Sunday newspaper about a member of staff at Leeds General Infirmary.’ The Mail on Sunday has agreed to hand over its dossier of evidence to police. The move comes as fresh testimony emerged that Dr Ferrie, a consultant paediatric neurologist and a leading expert on childhood epilepsy based at Leeds General, has been a regular user of powerful illegal drugs, including dangerous and addictive Class As, for some time. Following our shocking exposé last weekend, this paper was contacted by another drug-taking friend of the consultant about a night of debauchery last May during which Dr Ferrie consumed five different mind-altering substances. As well as two powerful Class A stimulants – cocaine and crystal meth – he also took party and date-rape drug GHB, the Class B stimulant mephedrone (similar to ecstasy and often referred to as Mcat), and sniffed amyl nitrite or ‘poppers’. ‘I was surprised by just how keen he was on taking chemicals but I knew he was a doctor so I guessed he must know what he was doing,’ said the man. ‘Now I think he needs help. Inquiry: Dr Colin Ferrie has been suspended from his role at Leeds General Infirmary . ‘That night he took cocaine, GHB, Mcat, crystal meth and poppers and then drove home, saying he had work the next day.’ In text messages exchanged before the meeting on May 4, the doctor left nothing to chance in his quest to secure narcotics. Concerned that his companion might not be able to afford the cocktail of drugs, Dr Ferrie sent him a text message asking: ‘Do u want me to transfer some cash for the chems?’ The man replied that he could get the mephedrone and try to find GHB – referred to as ‘g’ in the message – saying the drugs would cost £30 in total. Almost immediately, the doctor replied: ‘I reckon we will need more. I’ll transfer 60.’ Minutes later, the consultant sent another text: ‘Will we be able to get more later if we need it?’ before sending a further message: ‘Pity you cannot get Tina.’ Tina is a street name for powerfully addictive crystal meth, the most potent and long-lasting form of methamphetamine, and which was made famous in the hit TV series Breaking Bad. Last week we revealed that Dr Ferrie had spoken of his love for the drug, the effects of which can last for several days. The man said that when the doctor arrived for their meeting in Manchester at around 9.30pm on May 4, he brought crystal meth with him as well as three grams of cocaine and ‘poppers’. ‘After he had transferred me £60, I had bought two bags of Mcat for us, as well as 40ml of GHB, so I was surprised by how much more he brought with him. ‘He had a little bag with him containing the coke – there was enough for about 15 lines, some crystal meth which he took through a tube, and poppers which give you a headrush. There were three of us there and we pretty much did all the drugs, going on until about 5.30am. ‘Then Colin drove home. I asked if he’d be all right driving and he said he was used to it. He told me he had work the next day, but I don’t know if he was referring to the Monday or the Tuesday.’ Last week, Dr Ferrie was unavailable for comment, but when The Mail on Sunday contacted him on Friday he said: ‘I have no comment to make.’ Asked whether he had taken a cocktail of drugs on May 4 last year, he refused to comment. Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust refused to say whether the consultant was on duty over that May Bank Holiday weekend. A spokeswoman said: ‘As there is now a police investigation into this matter, we are not able to comment on whether Dr Ferrie was on duty on any given date.’ West Yorkshire Police said that the same officers who investigated shamed Co-op Bank boss the Reverend Paul Flowers (centre) –who has since been prosecuted for his drug use – would be handling the inquiry . On call: An hour after Dr Colin Ferrie was filmed snorting cocaine and taking the powerful sedative and date-rape drug GHB, Leeds General Infirmary, above, confirmed he was on call for his vulnerable young patients . The hospital admitted that worried parents of his vulnerable patients had been ringing in to ask about the scandal. ‘We have a Patient Advice and Liaison Service which has been taking calls from concerned parents and have talked them through what is going on with the help of a consultant neurologist,’ said the spokeswoman. She added: ‘Dr Ferrie has been excluded from duties at the Trust pending the outcome of an investigation into allegations against him. The Trust has been in contact with West Yorkshire Police about this matter and is fully co-operating with them. ‘Arrangements are being made to ensure scheduled clinics and appointments can go ahead with alternative staff providing cover.’ The maximum penalty for the possession of Class A drugs is seven years in prison, while for Class B drugs it is five years. GHB is Class C drug, and supplying someone else, even friends, can result in up to 14 years in jail. Family of epilepsy boy sue over care . By Stephanie Condron for the Mail On Sunday . Colin Ferrie is being sued for negligence by the family of a 14-year-old epilepsy patient, it emerged last night. News of the legal action comes after the consultant was suspended from clinical work at Leeds General Infirmary following our revelations last week. The teenager’s family, who have asked not to be identified, complain that instead of referring the boy for surgery at the earliest possible stage in his illness, Dr Ferrie put him on a succession of about 15 strong drugs that has left him with the mental age of a toddler. The boy’s mother lost faith with Dr Ferrie and instead took her son to Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, where she was told he was a prime candidate for surgery that would help stop up to 150 seizures a day. The youngster finally had the operation in August 2013. The child’s mother said she was ‘deeply disturbed’ to learn that Dr Ferrie had been filmed snorting cocaine and taking GHB. ‘Shocked does not even cover it,’ she told The Mail on Sunday. ‘I am still physically shaking now from reading it. It’s horrendous.’ Her son has a rare form of epilepsy called Doose syndrome, which causes him to fall to the floor without warning. He was having about 150 fits a day when Dr Ferrie first began treating him. She says her son ‘should have had this surgery when he was five or six years old after the third or fourth medication did not work’. The family originally asked for a second opinion in 2007, presenting the request in writing to Dr Ferrie during an appointment. ‘He screwed it up and put it in the bin,’ she said. ‘Years later, we were still not happy – my son was getting worse and worse.’ She launched a clinical negligence claim in November 2013. Her lawyers are now compiling a dossier on the family’s complaints. Last night, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust confirmed Dr Ferrie had been treating the boy and issued a brief statement which read: ‘We can confirm we have been approached by the family’s legal representatives for information about care provided by the Trust.’ Dr Ferrie said he did not want to comment, referring The Mail on Sunday to the Medical Defence Union, a body that advises doctors on negligence claims. An MDU spokesman said: ‘He cannot give his side of the story because he has a duty of patient confidentiality.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Dr Colin Ferrie was filmed snorting cocaine and taking date-rape drug GHB .

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott has confirmed that Australian Special Forces have begun providing training and assistance for an Iraqi security force which a former intelligence officer claims has committed war crimes. The Australian Special Operations Task Group has partnered with the Counter-Terrorism Service of Iraq in order to aid the fight against Islamic State (IS), a cohort which has openly posted photos of executed militants on social media. The group has been labelled as 'responsible for major war crimes and unnecessary civilian casualties' by a former Australia intelligence officer, reported The Sun Herald. Scroll down for video . Wearing a leather jacket, Prime Minister Tony Abbott greeted diggers serving at the Baghdad Diplomatic Support Compound . Mr Abbott made a rare criticism of US foreign policy in Iraq, saying the aftermath of the invasion had left the country in 'chaos and confusion' The service operates independently from the Iraqi state defense force, working directly under Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and created by the United States military to track al-Qaeda in Iraq within the country. However, US General David Patraeus told former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in 2009 that the forces were 'the most important forces in the counter-terrorism fight'. A senior general in Baghdad also justified execution of prisoners on the spot as 'a field reaction' to the crimes committed by IS, reported The Sun Herald. The 12,000 strong force has been vetted by the Australian Defense Department, which maintains that the ADF are contractually obligated to report human rights violations. 'No istances of alleged human rights violations have been reported since the Special Operations Task Group started co-operating with the Iraqi Counter-Terrorism Service in late 2014,' said a spokesperson for the Department. The revelation follows Prime Minister Tony Abbott's remarks that the American-led invasion of Iraq left the country in chaos. Mr Abbott made the rare criticism of Australia's strongest ally during a surprise visit to Baghdad, and has not ruled out sending more troops to the war-torn nation. 'Iraq is a country which has suffered a very great deal. First, decades of tyranny under Saddam Hussein. Then, the chaos and confusion that followed the American-led invasion. 'Most recently, the tumult, the dark age, which has descended upon Northern Iraq as a result of the Daesh death cult, but Australia will do what we can to help.' On the third leg of an unannounced visit to the troubled region, Mr Abbott held talks with the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi in Dubai and visited an airbase. 'I certainly don't rule out doing what we reasonably can to make the world a safer place,' he said after the meeting. Australia is part of the US-led coalition carrying out air strikes against ISIL in Iraq and has deployed special forces troops to assist in training the local army. 'Because the ISIL or Daesh death cult has declared war on the world, including here and Australia.' Mr Abbott said he looked forward to further talks with Baghdad and coalition partners about what Australia 'can usefully do'. First visit to Iraq: Mr Abbott is pictured here with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi . The prime minister's latest comments and those he made after a meeting with Iraqi leader Haider Al-Abadi on Sunday have led to speculation Australia might be prepared to go beyond its limited commitment to the conflict. Back home, the Labor opposition is holding back bipartisan support for any expanded role. Instead it will wait for a detailed briefing from the government before revealing its position. Mr Abbott also rejected criticism of the secrecy surrounding his visit to Iraq and the United Arab Emirates. In a departure from previous practice, Australian media were excluded from covering the visit first-hand and were forced to rely on footage provided by the prime minister's office in Canberra. The opposition accused the government of pursuing a culture of secrecy, saying it was not in the national interest. But Mr Abbott said the media was excluded for 'understandable security reasons'.","Tony Abbott has confirmed the ADF are training elite Iraqi security forces .

"Ed Miliband has risked dragging Labour’s record on the Iraq War into the Election by using Alastair Campbell to play the role of David Cameron to help him prepare for TV debates. Tony Blair’s former Downing Street spin doctor has been asked to ‘sharpen up’ Miliband’s performance in preparation for a TV showdown. Campbell has been asked to impersonate Cameron and show Miliband how to expose the Prime Minister’s weaknesses. ‘No one gets under Cameron’s skin more than Alastair,’ said a Labour insider. ‘He has been goading toffs all his life.’ Role play: Alastair Campbell and Labour leader Ed Miliband at Tony Benn's funeral last year . But some Labour MPs are worried the move could backfire. Campbell was forced to quit No10 in disgrace in 2003 over the Iraq War dodgy dossiers and the events that led to the death of Ministry of Defence weapons expert Dr David Kelly. ‘Campbell represents everything that people hate about politics – spin, dark arts, class war and macho aggression,’ said one Labour MP. ‘And it will allow our enemies to rake up the Iraq War and Campbell’s part in it.’ Miliband has distanced himself from the Iraq War but Labour chiefs fear that if the long-awaited Chilcot report into the conflict is published before the Election, it could still damage Labour. Electrifying: David Cameron, Nick Clegg and then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown during a 2010 TV debate . Campbell was accused of ‘sexing up’ intelligence reports suggesting Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. And when MoD expert Dr Kelly was named as the source of claims of exaggeration, Campbell was accused of being involved in moves to leak his name. Kelly died shortly afterwards, reportedly as a result of suicide. Miliband is pinning his hopes on the TV Election debates to reduce Cameron’s significant lead over him in their personal ratings. Criticism: Ukip leader Nigel Farage, pictured, accused Cameron of being a 'chicken' after he claimed it was unfair to exclude the Green Party . Hopes of a rerun of the TV debates that electrified the 2010 Election took a knock last week when Cameron refused to take part, claiming it was unfair to exclude the Green Party. It came after broadcast regulators Ofcom said Ukip’s Nigel Farage should be included in the debates, but not the Greens. Miliband, Nick Clegg and Farage joined forces to accuse the Prime Minister of being a ‘chicken’. Tory insiders privately admit they are wary of the TV debates. And last night, veteran Tory peer Norman Tebbit added to the pressure on Mr Cameron, saying voters would think he was ‘frit’ if he did not take part in the debates. Lord Tebbit said: ‘I don’t think it is going to improve his image... and anyway the public enjoy these confrontations.’ Labour sources say they are determined to ‘shame’ Cameron into taking part. Campbell, who went to grammar school and Cambridge University and worked for the Daily Mirror before becoming a Labour spin doctor, has never concealed his loathing of privately educated Cameron and George Osborne. His allies say he relishes the role of playing Cameron. ‘Alastair is the best propagandist our party has had,’ said one. ‘He is not a particular fan of Ed but it doesn’t matter. He had arguments with Gordon Brown but helped him in 2010. He is a tribal Labour supporter who hates Tories. And best of all, he frightens them.’ Asked if Campbell was playing the role of Cameron for Miliband, a spokesman for the Labour leader said: ‘We have no comment.’ Miliband and his team had an ‘TV debate rehearsal away day’ before Christmas. It is not known if Campbell took part.","Campbell asked to impersonate Prime Minister ahead of TV debates .

"A&E departments are so busy that closing more will cost lives, Britain’s top emergency doctor has warned. Dr Clifford Mann said NHS bosses must urgently rethink any plans they have to shut casualty units because it will ‘risk patient safety’ – and take patient care into ‘uncharted territory’. Dr Mann’s comments come amid fears a new wave of A&E closures could sweep the NHS after May’s General Election, despite the unprecedented demand and longer waiting times for emergency treatment. Scroll down for video . Warning: 'Given current demands... any further reduction in their number would be a potential risk to patient safety,' said Dr Clifford Mann (pictured), president of the College of Emergency Medicine . For more than two years, The Mail on Sunday has campaigned against casualty closures, which health bosses and doctors have argued are necessary. But the changes often lead to patients who need urgent treatment travelling further in ambulances or being told to go to a centre staffed by general doctors and nurses, rather than specialised units. Last week, 17 hospitals across England declared ‘major incidents’. Some A&Es were so full that doctors shut their doors on ambulance crews trying to bring in seriously ill patients, paramedics claimed. Dr Mann, president of the College of Emergency Medicine, said part of the reason for this winter’s chaos was that England’s network of A&E units had shrunk in the past decade, even though demand had ballooned. Over the past ten years the number of people attending fully staffed and equipped A&Es has jumped 13 per cent to 14.2 million. That is equivalent to the number of patients treated annually by 25 A&E departments, according to a report by the highly-respected Nuffield Trust think-tank. But instead of building more, 13 A&Es have been closed since 2005. They have been downgraded to ‘urgent care centres’ (UCCs) or ‘minor injury units’ (MIUs), which cannot deal with serious illness or injury. Some are closed at night. Nine of the 13 A&E closures have occurred under the Coalition government. Most recently, two were downgraded in west London last September, and figures now show A&E waits have spiked at nearby Northwick Park Hospital, to which patients are being transferred. England now has 181 A&Es, which health bosses argue is still too many, saying the evidence from cutting smaller stroke, heart attack and trauma units is that centralising emergency services saves lives. Closures: Across England since 2005, 13 A&Es have been 'downgraded' - meaning they were closed and replaced with urgent care centres or minor injury units . But Dr Mann said English A&Es were already ‘incredibly busy’ by international standards – and that widespread closures would worsen the situation. Around a dozen A&Es are thought to be under threat. Dr Mann said: ‘In England we talk about a small emergency department being one that deals with 60,000 patients a year. 'But in the US, Australia and much of Europe that would probably be the largest emergency department in the country.’ The combined effect of increasing demand and the 13 closures means the ‘average’ English A&E now sees 78,500 patients a year – up 13,000, or 20 per cent, since 2004. Dr Mann said: ‘The idea we need to reduce the number of emergency departments and centralise more services, seems to me a fairly brave statement given we are already at one end of the scale, when you compare us internationally. For more than two years The Mail on Sunday has campaigned to save A&Es from closure. We have cut through NHS and ministerial spin to show how shutting departments has led to neighbouring hospitals becoming gridlocked, while towns have been left with inadequate services. Given current demands on our emergency departments, any further reduction would be a potential risk to patient safety.’ A year ago, NHS England unveiled a controversial plan to develop 40 to 70 ‘major emergency centres’. NHS England medical director Prof Sir Bruce Keogh insisted this would not result in closures, but critics said it would lead to a ‘two-tier’ A&E system in which smaller units suffered. Insiders say the scheme has been put on ice over fears it amounts to ‘political suicide’ – a claim denied by NHS England. But it is believed the plan will be revived after May. Dr Mann said: ‘We have succeeded in creating large emergency departments that give us economies of scale, and concentrate expertise. 'But to go any further is to go into uncharted territory globally.’ Dr Mann stressed he was not against every single downgrade and said ‘rationalisation’ sometimes made sense. But just because centralising stroke, heart attack and trauma units had worked, that did not mean the same approach would benefit the other 95 per cent of A&E patients. Latest weekly statistics show only 79.8 per cent of patients attending England’s 181 A&Es were treated within four hours. The target is 95 per cent. Dr Sarah Pinto-Duschinsky, of NHS England, said: ‘The NHS continues to face unprecedented pressures on frontline services. Flu is at its highest for the last three winters.’ The NHS is under so much strain, medical students are being drafted in to do unpaid hospital shifts, The Mail on Sunday has learnt. Fifth-year students at Leeds University have been asked to ‘undertake extra shift and weekend work’ in local hospitals, according to a leaked email from Professor Paul Stewart, dean of its medical school. Students are not being forced to do the extra shifts, which come on top of their normal placements, but Prof Stewart wrote: ‘We have no doubt you will rise to the occasion.’ Students last night said they were keen to help. But one said: ‘There is no way of dressing this up as anything other than desperation.’ Volunteers will get travel expenses and a ‘subsistence’ allowance.","Doctor says NHS bosses must urgently rethink plans to shut units .

"A British hate preacher backed the Paris massacres just hours after the bloody events unfolded and told his followers ‘Britain is the enemy of Islam’. Cleric Mizanur Rahman, of Palmers Green, north London, defended the brutal murder of 12 people at the Charlie Hebdo offices, saying ‘insulting Islam…they can’t expect a different result.’ Experts have warned the sermon, which backed the jihadists who killed 17 people over three days in the French capital, could incite further killings. Scroll down for video . Mizanur Rahman defended the  Charlie Hebdo massacre and said ‘insulting Islam…they can’t expect a different result' Speaking to an audience in London which was streamed online to thousands of his followers, Rahman praised Al Qaeda and said ‘Britain is the enemy of Islam.’ Sam Westrop, director of counter-extremism group Stand for Peace told the Sunday Mirror: ‘His kind of rhetoric is not an echo of Islamist terror and extremism – it is a driving force behind it. ‘It is truly reprehensible for him to speak like this, especially so soon after Paris.’ His speech on Friday night came to light after reporters from the Sunday Mirror gained access to an online live stream  - they then notified the Metropolitan Police. The newspaper reported that in the video Rahman claimed France was carrying out 'ethnic cleansing', and told his followers what happened in France was 'war.' Members of the public light candles in tribute to the 17 dead in Paris following three days of terror attacks . He said: 'These cartoons is part of their own war, is part of the psychological warfare...you know what happens when you insult Mohammed.' Rahman, who also goes by the name of Abu Baraa, is currently on police bail after he and others were arrested last year on suspicion of terror offences. Rahman, was jailed for six years in 2007 after calling for British soldiers to be brought back from Iraq in bodybags. He manages the Siddeeq Academy in Tower Hamlets, an Islamic tuition centre in East London. In May last year Rahman was investigated by police after a video showed him praising the Boko Haram militants who kidnapped more than 300 Nigerian schoolgirls. He said at the time: ‘People want to make it out as though history began on the day these girls were taken from - sorry I should say these women - were taken from this high school in Nigeria. The kosher supermarket in Paris where four men and their hostage-taker died on Friday . ‘They didn’t do to these girls what the Nigerian government had been doing to the Muslims all these years. ‘They didn’t rape anybody. They didn’t torture. They didn’t murder any of these girls.’ On another occasion a court heard he told a crowd of around 300 people near the Danish Embassy in central London that British and American troops should return in body bags. The Old Bailey saw film of Rahman in which he said: 'We want to see them coming home in body bags. 'We want to see their blood running in the streets of Baghdad.' He added: 'We want to see the Mujahideen shoot down their planes the way we shoot down birds, we want to see their tanks burn in the way we burn their flags.'

"The Foreign Office has advised British tourists travelling to Paris to be ‘especially vigilant’ following this week's shootings, issuing a warning over the possibility of indiscriminate attacks across the city. The shootings that killed 12 people at the Charlie Hebdo office on January 7 were followed by a shootout involving hostages at a supermarket in Porte de Vincennes. A gunman also shot and injured people in Montrouge. ‘There is a high threat from terrorism,’ the Foreign Office advised British travellers on its website. Scroll down for video . Security at popular tourist attractions in Paris, including the Eiffel Tower, has  been bolstered . ‘Attacks could be indiscriminate. You should be especially vigilant at this time and follow the security advice issued by the French authorities.’ Despite the alerts, French tourism chiefs are confident British travellers will continue to visit Paris to ‘show solidarity’. The country’s tourist board also warned that tourists needed to remain vigilant, while the region is still currently on an ‘attack alert’ level of security. Security at popular tourist attractions has also been bolstered. In a statement released yesterday the French Tourist board said it hoped British travellers ‘will continue their visits to Paris and thereby show solidarity and not let these horrible attacks defeat us. As it has been said elsewhere, Fraternité is as important as Liberté. ‘Travellers should act responsibly, take extra care and follow any security advice from the French authorities.’ The Paris tourist board said that ‘all sites, notably tourist attractions that require extra security are part of the plan’ It added that it ‘unites with the Paris city council authorities to condemn this horrifying attack and to assure visitors that everything will be done to ensure their safety.’ Londoners yesterday insisted they would continue travelling to Paris despite the increased security threat.

Jack Churchland, 32, a plumbing company director from Clapham, said he and his wife Rowena, 40, had decided to travel with their two young children because they believed Paris was no more dangerous than London. He told the Evening Standard: ‘It's a pre-booked trip we had planned for a while. Obviously when we saw what had happened we did think “maybe we shouldn't go”. But we live in London. It's a dangerous city too. Paris is a big place that now has additional security and I am sure we can avoid any trouble.’ Chris Rowlands, 32, a plant mechanic, had booked a surprise birthday trip to Paris for his partner Lauren Sayers, 29, a psychologist. He said: ‘I only told her we were going a few hours ago. I was worried she wouldn't want to go. Obviously it's scary but these kinds of attacks are more common now.’ The country’s tourist board warned that tourists needed to remain vigilant in the wake of the shootings in the region, which is on an ‘attack alert’ level of security . Matthew Salfarlie, 39, an accountant from Kentish Town who used to live in Paris, was going to visit friends for the weekend. He said: ‘I never thought of cancelling and it won't affect my plans. It shouldn't deter us otherwise the attackers will have succeeded in terrorising us. After 7/7 I went to work the next day on the Tube. I was a bit nervous but I thought it was important to carry on as normal.’ It comes as the United States issued a global travel warning after recent terror attacks in France, Australia and Canada. Issued by the State Department, the warning states that violent attacks involving Americans are becoming more common. ‘Recent terrorist attacks, whether by those affiliated with terrorist entities, copycats, or individual perpetrators, serve as a reminder that US citizens need to maintain a high level of vigilance and take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness,’ the alert reads. French tourism chiefs are confident British travellers will continue to visit Paris to ‘show solidarity’ following the terror attacks  this week . The alert does not reference any particular events specifically, but does make note of ‘increasingly prevalent’ kidnappings and hostage situations around the world. Last year, a gunman killed a soldier near Canada's parliament while a hostage situation in Sydney, Australia left two innocent people dead. Additionally, the State Department noted that ‘reprisal attacks’ from the Islamic State against the US and its coalition partners are more likely to take place overseas. The extremist group has promised to strike back against the US for trying to destroy the group, which has currently taken over wide swathes of Iraq and Syria. ‘In response to [US] airstrikes, the Islamic State called on supporters to attack foreigners wherever they are,’ the warning reads. ‘Authorities believe there is an increased likelihood of reprisal attacks against US, Western and coalition partner interests throughout the world, especially in the Middle East, North Africa, Europe, and Asia.’ Americans are reminded that militants routinely kidnap Westerners hoping to earn a ransom for their return, and that various public transportation systems could be at risk. The State Department also said that US government buildings overseas will be on high alert.","The country’s tourist board warned that tourists needed to remain vigilant .

"Some of Missouri's top leaders tried unsuccessfully to pressure Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson to resign after the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, interviews with several elected officials and newly released records show. Ferguson Mayor James Knowles III told The Associated Press on Friday that top state officials had several meetings where they applied pressure on the city to force Jackson to resign. Missouri House Speaker John Diehl and U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill confirmed they both attended a fall meeting to discuss whether Jackson should be forced out. Also, records provided to AP under an open records request include a Nov. 10 email from St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar to an assistant that describes an apparent meeting of state and local officials. It references the potential timing of Jackson's 'separation' and identifies a potential successor. Some of Missouri's top leaders tried unsuccessfully to pressure Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson to resign after the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, interviews with several elected officials and newly released records show . Jackson's leadership drew wide criticism from the outset, both for the aggressive police response to protesters and for his agency's erratic and infrequent releases of key information . Brown, 18 and unarmed, was shot by officer Darren Wilson on Aug. 9, and the shooting of a black suspect by a white officer led to significant unrest in St. Louis County. Jackson's leadership drew wide criticism from the outset, both for the aggressive police response to protesters and for his agency's erratic and infrequent releases of key information. He refused to publicly identify Wilson as the shooter for nearly a week after Brown's death, then simultaneously released the name with store security video that police said showed Brown stealing a box of cigars and shoving a clerk a short time before his death. The unrest in St. Louis County escalated after the Nov. 24 announcement that a grand jury declined to indict Wilson, who later resigned. Knowles on Friday refused to name any of the officials who urged Jackson's removal. 'I was at a lot of meetings where that was brought up,' Knowles said. 'There were different people advocating for the chief to be fired or quit or whatever. I want to make it clear: We never considered that.' A message left with Jackson was not returned. Brown, 18 and unarmed, was shot by officer Darren Wilson on Aug. 9, and the shooting of a black suspect by a white officer led to significant unrest in St. Louis County . McCaskill confirmed in a written statement that she attended such a meeting — one of many involving community leaders, elected officials and members of law enforcement, the statement said. 'And a variety of issues were discussed to help ease tension in the St. Louis region, and address systemic issues highlighted in Ferguson-issues including personnel changes at the Ferguson police department,' the statement said. St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay and his chief of staff, Jeff Rainford, attended several such meetings, Rainford said. Diehl said he participated in two meetings — one in Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster's office in St. Louis — in which officials discussed efforts to try to get both Jackson and Wilson to resign. Diehl said the meetings occurred around the time of the Nov. 4 elections and he disagreed with the attempts to seek their resignations, because the grand jury process was ongoing. 'A substantial part of the conversation centered around trying to get Darren Wilson to resign prior to the decision of the grand jury and to get Chief Jackson to resign, and I didn't have any interest in participating in that,' Diehl, a Republican from the St. Louis suburb of Town and Country, said. Diehl said Jackson's resignation would have left 'a leadership vacuum' on the police force and 'I didn't think it was proper for someone in my position to get involved.' The email from Belmar has the subject line, 'Ferguson Chief Jackson Meeting,' and the text is written in note form. The unrest in St. Louis County escalated after the Nov. 24 announcement that a grand jury declined to indict Wilson, who later resigned . At one point it indicates that a St. Louis County police lieutenant colonel named Doyle 'will become the ranking officer of the FPD.' Doyle's first name isn't given, but Troy Doyle is a lieutenant colonel for the county. The email lists several names of apparent attendees: McCaskill, Koster, Slay, Rainford, Diehl, Doyle, then-St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley and U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay. Spokespeople for Clay and Koster declined comment, and messages seeking comment from Dooley and St. Louis County police were not returned. The email also made reference to a request to Gov. Jay Nixon to place the National Guard in front of Ferguson police headquarters on the date of the grand jury announcement. 'Apparently the guard will not move to the FPD per the governor,' the email said. Knowles and others were critical of the decision not to have the Guard in place at the time of the announcement, after a dozen area businesses were destroyed in fires during protests.","Some of Missouri's top leaders tried unsuccessfully to pressure Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson to resign after the fatal shooting of Michael Brown .

"New York Jets running back Chris Johnson was arrested after officers noticed a firearm in his car when he was pulled over . New York Jets running back Chris Johnson has been arrested in Florida for carrying a firearm. The NFL star was pulled over by a patrol car in Orlando, his hometown, on Friday after driving through a stop sign. The 29-year-old was then arrested after the officer spotted the handle of a weapon in between his feet. Police spokesperson Sergeant Wanda Ford told ESPN that she wasn't sure if the gun was loaded but it should have been concealed at the time. He reportedly has a licence to carry the weapon in the state. Johnson was booked into a local jail and released on a $250 bond. A Jets spokesman released a statement, saying: 'We are aware and have no comment at this time, as this is a pending legal matter.' The former Tennessee Titans player, who was released from the franchise last April, signed a two-year, $8 million contract with the Jets. However he could be a victim of the salary cap in the coming weeks. The Jets have a team option over him, but are unlikely to renew it. Johnson is the fifth-leading active rusher in the NFL with 8,628 yards,and one of only seven players to rush for 2,000 yards in a season. In his first season with the Jets, he recorded only 155 carries, 663 rushing yards and one touchdown. He is the second Jets player this week to have a run in with the law. The 29-year-old, who has just finished his first season for the Jets, was detained after the officer spotted the handle of a weapon in between his feet .

The Union County prosecutor's office said Cunningham was arrested December 29 in Summit, New Jersey, and charged with invasion of privacy, criminal mischief and unlawful weapons transport. They allege Cunningham violated a law that forbids disclosing photos or videos without the consent of someone 'whose intimate parts are exposed' or who is engaged in a sex act.","NFL star was pulled over in Orlando after driving through a stop sign .

"Arrested again: Danielle Watkins has been arrested for breaking a protective order which prohibited her from any contact with any of her victims . A former Connecticut high school teacher awaiting sentencing over a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old student has been arrested again after allegedly threatening to kill one of her accusers. Police say 32-year-old Danielle Watkins of Norwalk was arrested Friday. She was first arrested in July, accused of having sex with one student at Stamford High and giving marijuana to another. Police say she threatened one of the victims at a doughnut shop Friday. Watkins pleaded guilty to second-degree sexual assault and risk of injury to a minor last month under a deal with prosecutors. The agreement calls for her to serve between nine months and four years in jail. Watkins' attorney Rob Serafinowicz told The Hour of Norwalk his client's new arrest is 'an unfortunate turn of events.' Watkins allegedly ran into the student she was accused of giving marijuana to and attacked him for ruining her career, according to the The Hour. She screamed, that she 'will not rest until you and (the teen she had sex with) are dead'. The teenager was so rattled by the encounter that he and his mother made the complaint to police in Norwalk and Watkins was arrested for violating an order to stay away from her victims. Violating that order which commands her not to 'assault, threaten, abuse, follow, inter with or stalk' the vicitms is a felony and punishable by five years behind bars.' Watkins is currently being held on a $25,000 cash bond. In December, the Connecticut high school English teacher pleaded guilty to felony charges related to a sexual relationship she carried on with an underage student. Watkins has two young children. She accepted a plea agreement on that will lead to a jail term of up to four years . Danielle Watkins accepted a plea agreement on Thursday that will lead to a jail term of up to four years. The 32-year-old Watkins entered her pleas to felony charges of second-degree sexual assault and risk of injury to a minor. The agreement calls for her to be placed on the state's Sex Offender Registry for 10 years. She's set to return to Stamford Superior Court for sentencing Jan. 22. The plea agreement calls for her to serve between nine months and four years in jail. Two school administrators were charged with failing to report the relationship and received probation. Watkins, who is married with two young children, also sent the teen nude pictures during their eight-month relationship and supplied him and a friend with marijuana, cops said. The underage student waited until after school let out for the year last year to tell authorities about the relationship because, he said, Watkins had threatened to fail him if he broke things off . On June 27, police officers pulled over Watkins' car and inside they found marijuana and a cell phone, which contained evidence she had sent naked photos of herself to the boy. Lt. Diedrich Hohn, in charge of the case, told MailOnline that she was 'hostile' and 'verbally combative' during the search. As cops pulled her over, she had tried to hide her cellphone under the passenger seat, he said. Watkins allegedly exchanged more than 2,000 text messages and hundreds of phone calls with the teenager. Superintendent Winifred Hamilton said Watkins has been placed on administrative leave until the investigation is complete. 'We are aware of the allegations,' Hamilton said. 'We take these issues very seriously and always act to protect the welfare of our students.' Address records show Watkins, lives with a man, Jermaine, whom she is believed to be married to. Facebook images suggest they have two children together. She was also arrested earlier this year in her home town of Norwalk after prescription pills were found in her car after a minor accident. Neighbors say the married mother-of-two then went into rehab.","Danielle Watkins, 32, arrested for making death threat at friend of teenager .

"This intimate collection of photos capture Russia's imperial Romanov family like you've never seen them before. Huddled together on a day out at the beach or around the beds of soldiers wounded in the Great War, the pictures were taken shortly before their 300-year dynasty came to a tragic and abrupt end. Within a year of the album's latest photos, the Russian revolution swept across the country, Tsar Nicholas II abdicated and he and his family were exiled, before being murdered on Lenin's orders. Scroll down for video . Family outing: Tsar Nicholas poses with his four daughters  (L-R) Maria, Anastasia, Olga and Tatiana . In one image, Tsar Nicholas II and his daughters Anastasia, Maria, Olga and Tatiana look solemnly into the camera, the Emperor stood proudly in full military uniform. Another shows Maria, Olga and Tatiana paddling in shallow water at the beach - their younger brother Alexei, who would have been around 14 at the time, stood in front of his sisters. Many of these rare pictures, taken between 1915 and 1916, were shot by head of the family and Russia's last tsar himself, Nicholas II. An insatiable photographer, the tsar took great care of his pictures, filing them carefully in numerous albums. Day at the beach: (L-R) Maria and Olga and Tatiana Romanov pose at the beach with their brother Alexei . Father and daughter: Tsar Nicholas II and his daughter Anastasia (R), wearing false teeth . He passed down his love for photography to Maria, his third daughter, who was responsible for colouring most of the pictures. Several of the images show the family dutifully attending wounded soldiers near the front line - but as the war raged on, civil unrest mounted around the country. As the government failed to produce supplies, mounting hardship created massive riots and rebellions and by early 1917, Russia was on the verge of total collapse. On 23 February 1917 in Petrograd, a combination of very severe cold weather and acute food shortages caused people to start to break shop windows to get bread and other necessaries. Visiting soldiers: The Emperor and Anastasia and Maria visit wounded troops during the Great War . Happy times: Within a year of the album's latest photos, the Russian revolution swept across the country, Tsar Nicholas II abdicated and he and his family were exiled, before being murdered on Lenin's orders . In the streets, red banners appeared and the crowds chanted: 'Down with the German woman! !Down with the war! Down with the Tsar!' Order broke down and members of the Soviet Party demanded that Nicholas abdicate. Faced with this demand, which was echoed by his generals, deprived of loyal troops, with his family firmly in the hands of the Provisional Government and fearful of unleashing civil war and opening the way for German conquest, Nicholas had little choice but to submit. After his abdication on March 2, 1917, Nicholas II and his family were exiled to Tobolsk, where they initially lived in considerable comfort. Nicholas passed down his love for photography to Maria, his third daughter, who was responsible for colouring most of the pictures . Many of the unique photos were taken by Tsar Nicholas himself, who was an insatiable photographer . But following the Bolshevik revolution in October 1917, their living conditions worsened. In 1918 the Imperial family was imprisoned. As the White Russian troops approached the Urals, threatening to reach and free the Romanovs, the Imperial family met their fate. On the eve of July 16, 1918, the Tsar, his German-born wife Alexandra and their five children, were roused from their beds and escorted to the basement of Ipatiev House, where they had been imprisoned. Toll of the war: Tsar Nicholas II and daughters Anastasia and Maria Romanov visit wounded soldiers in the Great War . There they were callously murdered along with three servants and their doctor. The horrific story of the Romanovs' execution spawned the long-running myth that one of the children had survived and was living in secret somewhere in Russia. Hundreds of claims were made that either Anastasia or Alexei had somehow escaped the Bolshevisks' death squad. The horrific story of the Romanovs' execution spawned the long-running myth that one of the children had survived and was living in secret somewhere in Russia . (L-R) Maria, Olga and Tatiana Romanov, the daughters of Tsar's Nicholas II pictured just one or two years before they were exiled and later shot on orders of Lenin . Since her death, women posing as the Russian princess Anastasia have repeatedly come forward, among them Anna Anderson who first appeared in Berlin in 1920, two years after the Russian royals were executed. Anderson, who also went by the names Tschaikovsky and Manahan, later moved to the USA and was portrayed for decades as the escaped daughter of the last Romanov emperor. But in 1991, when the remains of the Russian royals were unearthed, DNA testing proved that the bodies were indeed those of the Tsar, Tsarina and their children. Olga Romanov is pictured lying in bed in this photo taken not long before she was murdered along with the rest of her family . Olga Romanov, (R) seen on the beach during the Great War, died with her sisters when Bolshevik fighters carried out orders to execute the royal family . After Tsar Nicholas abdicated on 15th March 1917, he and his family were moved from house to house as the revolution and ensuing civil war raged around them. By May 1918, they had been installed at the Ipatiev House in Yekaterinburg which was under Bolshevik control. The house was owned by Yakov Yurovsky, a dedicated Marxist and Bolshevik with close links to the Cheka - the secret police force run by the revolutionaries. At around 2.15am on the morning of the 17th July 1918, Yurovsky and a squad of Bolsheviks burst into the bedrooms of the Russian royals and ordered them into the cellar. Minutes later, the soldiers, each armed with a revolver and led by Yurovsky, followed them into the room. According to Yurovsky, he ordered them to stand. Characteristically, the Tsarina did so 'with a flash of anger'. 'Your relations have tried to save you,' he is believed to have said next. 'They have failed and we must now shoot you.' The Tsar rose from his chair and only had time to utter 'What...?' before he was shot several times in the chest. The Tsarina died next, killed by a single bullet fired by commissar Peter Ermakov that entered her head just above the left ear, followed by her haemophilliac son Alexei, who was just 13-years-old when he died. The last to perish were Anastasia and her sisters, saved, initially by the valuable diamonds hidden in their bodices. The girls were then bayoneted by the Bolshevik fighters before being finished off with a shot to the head.","Rarely seen photos produced between 1915 and 1916 during Great War .

"Outraged chocolate lovers have launched a protest campaign after Cadbury reduced the number of Creme Eggs sold in their boxes while keeping the price roughly the same. The chocolate giant has cut the number of eggs contained in each pack from six to five. The move is the latest example of secret price hikes as sweet brands downsize on products while barely reducing the cost to customers. Good old days: Chocolate giant Cadbury used to sell their Creme Eggs in boxes but recently downsized . Many Creme Egg fans have taken to Facebook and Twitter to complain about the situation. One disappointed customer said: 'I've been sold a faulty box of eggs. Instead of half a dozen there are only five in the box, the Mirror reports. 'As they still cost the same I'm assuming this is just a dodgy batch.' And Twitter user, Shani, wrote: 'Creme Eggs in packs of five? That's messing with the basic premise and I take eggception to that.' Trade magazine The Grocer said: 'Chocolate fans say it's no yolk that six packs of Cadbury Creme Eggs have been reduced to five packs.' Downsize: The firm has caused anger with Creme Egg fans by reducing the number found in a box to five . Brand owner Mondelez has got rid of three and six packs of Creme Eggs, which are sold only in the build up to Easter. The company has replaced them with a five pack to sell alongside singles and 12 packs. The move came with a slight decrease in the recommended retail price from £3.05 to £2.85. Some shops charge that, but many others sell the packs for £2 – the same price they charged for a six-pack a year ago. Mondelez claim the change was a result of 'consumer research', adding that shops are free to set their own prices. Concern: Many Cadbury customers took to to Twitter to complain about the reduction in Creme Eggs found in each box . Last year Cadbury caused controversy when they announced they would no longer be making their beloved sacks of chocolate coins - just before Christmas. Explaining their decision, a spokesman told The Telegraph that wrapping foil around the coin-shaped chocolates was 'fiddly' work. They suggested the coins were not as profitable as other products because they could not market them in the 'Cadbury purple'. The chocolate maker also believes shoppers have switched to cheaper, own-brand versions sold at supermarkets such as Aldi and Lidl causing its own sales to decline. 'We are sorry to see the coins go, but that's business,' the spokesman added.

"A young man who died after being washed into the sea from Brighton's Palace Pier, died over a bet for just £50. Dan Nicholls, 23, and Freddie Reynolds, 24, had been enjoying a night on the town with friends before heading to the pier to take part in the bet. They were last seen clinging to each other in the choppy waters before disappearing around 1am on Saturday. Mr Nicholls was knocked off his feet and swept out to sea after taking on the bet, which involved him standing as close to the stormy sea front as possible. His friend and former school mate, Mr Reynolds, died after diving into save him along with two others, that managed to make their way back to the shore. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Dan Nicholls, 23, (L) and Freddie Reynolds, 24, (R) both drowned after being swept out to sea at Brighton Pier around 1am Saturday . Mr Nicholls body was found on the beach in Rottingdean, about three and a half miles east of pier, at 8.10am today. The body of Mr Reynolds was found yesterday afternoon in Saltdean, four miles east of the pier. A Surrey Police spokesman today confirmed what had motivated Mr Nicholls to take part in the dare. Detective Chief Inspector Carwyn Hughes said: 'What was a bit of fun had tragic consequences in this case. 'I urge the public, please, at this time of year especially look at the conditions. You've got to make your own risk assessment but fundamentally don't enter the see at this time of year in these conditions.' Det. Chief Insp. Hughes said the group of seven friends, who were seeing off a friend who was about to emigrate, had discussed the dare before seeing the ferocity of the waves. The sea was a gale force nine and 'very dangerous', he said. Mr Reynolds family said they were immensely proud of their son for trying to save his friend. In a statement the family said: 'We are devastated but also extremely proud of Freddie and the bravery he showed in trying to save Dan. The body of Mr Nicholls was found on the beach in Rottingdean, about three and a half miles east of the Palace Pier at 8.10am; pictured above a member of the Coastguard searches for the missing men . 'Freddie was a very loyal and brilliant friend. He was always looking out for his friends and family and people loved to be around him. He was incredibly funny and loved a joke and a banter around the dinner table.' Mr Reynolds family said he had a variety of interests, and could often be found skateboarding at The Level, or updating his online music collection. The statement went on to say: 'He was a brilliant partner to girlfriend Stephanie and was always showering her in cuddles. Sister Rosie describes him as a wonderful brother who was always there for her. 'He has a half brother Matthew. He had been a student at Dorothy Stringer School and was now working as a dispensary technician at Ashtons where he was popular amongst his colleagues. Members of the Brighton and Hove Volunteer Lifeboat Crews recovered the body of Mr Reynolds on Saturday four miles east of Palace Pier . Searche and rescue staff brace themselves in the wind and search along the coastline for the two missing men . 'His loss will leave a huge void in a lot of people's lives. His friends and family would like to thank everyone who has been involved in the search for Freddie.' The two men were old school friends who used to share a flat together in central Brighton. Mr Nicholls family described him as being 'very bright, he was quick and witty with lots of friends to whom he was close and loyal'. They added: 'He loved music which he both made and produced. Dan had a passion for cookery and in July last year prepared a culinary feast as part of his graduation celebrations. 'Dan enjoyed skateboarding at The Level in Brighton with friends and was also a Brighton & Hove Albion season ticket with his mother. Dan was a sensitive individual who had a real enthusiasm for life. He was a gentleman who always showed concern for others and was a great 'hugger'. 'Dan was bright and insightful and was a close friend of Freddie. 'Dan leaves his mother Wendy and his sister Martha. The family have received well wishes from a number of people and he was clearly well loved by many.' Coastguard and lifeboat teams spent Friday night looking for the men  with two all-weather lifeboats, a rescue helicopter and two shoreline rescue teams but strong winds hindered the search efforts and they were stood down. Others in the group included a 26-year-old man from Brighton and a 23-year-old from London, officers said. They managed to get back to shore and called the coastguard, telling them their friends were missing. An agency spokesman said: 'The conditions for searching overnight were awful - it was pitch black and the sea was extremely choppy. It was very difficult to search. Two men in the group managed to get back to the shore and called the coastguard, telling them their companions were missing . Mr Nicholls and Mr Reynolds, both from Brighton, were old school friends who used to share a flat together, their families said . 'The helicopter and the all-weather lifeboats searched the area overnight but started to stand down at about 4am. They felt they had done all they could.' Matt West, UK Coastguard controller, said the conditions overnight had made the search extremely difficult for those involved as the weather was currently south west eight to severe gale force nine with very high waves. Emma James, 24, from Brighton, drove past the scene of the search at 1am while taking a friend home and watched it unfold over the next three hours. She said: 'There were police and rescue crews everywhere. It was pretty horrible. We just sat there for hours as we wanted them to be found. A helicopter and all-weather lifeboat searched the area overnight but started to stand down at about 4am after failing to find the two men . Police and rescue teams worked last night to try and save the men who had gone into the sea off Brighton pier just after 1am . 'The sea was so rough, the lifeboats looked like they were going to tip over they were being tossed around so much.' Emergency services were also called after an 18-year-old man was seen entering the sea in Brighton shortly before 9am. The man, who had taken his top and shoes off before running into the water just to the east of the Palace Pier, was helped from the sea by one of three friends who was with him. He was checked over on the beach by police and medical staff and taken to the Royal Sussex County Hospital by ambulance .","The body of Dan Nicholls was found today, a day after the body of his friend Freddie Reynolds, was found .

"The Queen’s Household Cavalry has been hit by claims that a gay soldier was bullied by a senior colleague over a number of years. The Ministry of Defence confirmed that an investigation has been launched after the soldier made an official complaint. The soldier – who asked The Mail on Sunday not to reveal his identity – serves in the Household Cavalry’s Mounted Regiment, which undertakes guard duty in London and takes part in events such as the Queen’s Birthday Parade. Inquiry: The soldier, who asked not to have his identity revealed, serves in the Household Cavalry, pictured . The colleague he accuses of bullying is understood to deny the allegation and is still on duty while the Royal Military Police investigates. In a statement released through the Ministry of Defence, the alleged victim said he was ‘devastated’ about the potential impact of the case being made public. He said: ‘I want to get on with my career and keep my private life private.’ The Armed Forces Service Complaints Commissioner’s report in 2013 found that the Army ‘does have a problem with bullying, harassment and discrimination and that there has been an increase in the occurrence of improper behaviour, not simply an increase in complaints about such behaviour’. However last year, Stonewall, the lesbian, gay and bisexual rights charity, named the MoD in the top 100 employers on its workplace equality index. It was only 15 years ago, in 2000, that the MoD allowed gay men, lesbians and transgender personnel to serve openly for the first time. In the previous year, nearly 300 people were discharged from the Army alone on the grounds of sexual orientation.

Following the posting - titled, 'Please tell my friend her boyfriend is cheating' - Miss Olguin allegedly received an email from a reader named Adam, accusing Mr Goullet of repeatedly cheating on her. The 49-year-old wardrobe stylist, who has been with Mr Goullet for three years, was also sent a mysterious letter at her Trump Place apartment in New York last April, the New York Post reported. According to court papers, the letter read: 'I know you have been with John for awhile. I feel you should know that I have seen him with another woman several times... It is not platonic.' Classified ads site: In the Craigslist post (file picture), the user allegedly accused Mr Goullet, an executive in the IT staffing firm Diversent, of sleeping with 'dozens of women', including some younger than his children . Mr Goullet, who lives in New Jersey, founded Info Technologies in 1994, before growing it into a $30million operation and eventually merging it with another firm to create Diversant Inc. He has denied the allegations, saying that they are false and malicious. In the lawsuit, he states Craigslist should be forced to reveal the identity of the user who posted the cheating claims. Speaking to The Post, he said: 'It’s a private matter and I don’t want any attention given to it.' Mr Goullet, a Ursinus College graduate, and Miss Olguin are believed to still be together.","John Goullet, 53, accused of cheating in anonymous post on Craigslist .

"Taxpayers are spending £100million every year on interpreters to help immigrants who cannot speak English, a Mail on Sunday investigation has found. Police, town halls, hospitals and courts are all spending huge sums on translating documents and providing professional interpreters to assist people with poor English. This is despite repeated Government attempts to save money and improve social cohesion by making new arrivals take English tests, and by telling councils not to waste money on translating leaflets. Police, town halls, hospitals and courts are all spending huge sums on translating documents and providing professional interpreters . It can be revealed today that: . Last night critics said that, at a time when budgets are being slashed by the Government, key public services can ill afford to spend millions of pounds to help immigrants who have not learned English. And they argued that translating can ultimately leave foreign language-speakers worse off – as they are less likely to get well-paid jobs in this country if they have not learned the language. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said: 'The guidance I've issued is crystal-clear – councils should stop wasting taxpayers' money by translating into foreign languages. Translation holds people back from integrating into British society. If they can't speak English, they're not going to get on. Money saved can be used to protect frontline services and keep council tax down.' Under the Freedom of Information Act, The Mail on Sunday asked public bodies across England to detail their costs for written translation of documents and face-to-face or telephone interpreting. Responses from 585 organisations, about two-thirds of those contacted, revealed they had spent £79 million in 2013-14, indicating that the total figure is well over £100 million. Most goes on face-to-face interpreters rather than document translation, which can be done free online. In the NHS, the sum spent on foreign language services has risen by 41 per cent over the past four years to reach at least £33 million. Dozens of hospitals failed to respond to our data requests. The biggest health spender is Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in East London, which spent £1.2 million in a year. Some hospitals have even installed full-time interpreters on their wards, such is the demand they face. But the details obtained by this newspaper indicate poor control of spending in some trusts. In one instance last January, a Bengali interpreter charged £126 for more than three hours' work, even though the interpretation took only ten minutes, during an endoscopy procedure. In another, the Trust was charged £162 for 4.5 hours' work by an Arabic interpreter, which in fact took 30 minutes during a home visit. Meanwhile a health board in Brighton translated a 'short video explaining what a clinical commissioning group is' into five languages, at a cost of £7,500. Another spent £1,678 on translating leaflets about 'the importance of registering with a GP'. One physiotherapist in South-West London reported having four appointments in a day – with an interpreter required at each. NHS organisations claim that offering translation and interpretation services to those with poor English is a 'mandatory requirement'. In its FOI response, Cannock Chase Clinical Commissioning Group stated: 'This is a mandatory requirement within the standard NHS contract that we use. The standard contract states, 'The Provider must provide appropriate assistance and make reasonable adjustments for Service Users, Carers and Legal Guardians who do not speak, read or write English or who have communication difficulties.' ' But some experts say that, in the vast majority of cases, providing this service is unnecessary. Julia Manning, chief executive of the think-tank 2020Health, said: 'I cannot imagine someone with zero English being in this country without having a relative who does speak the language, who could help them. It really should be the responsibility of family or friends to assist with understanding.' Latest figures show the Department for Work and Pensions spent £5 million on language services in a year, most on face-to-face and telephone help for jobseekers and benefits claimants. Meanwhile, councils in England spent £11 million on language services in the most recent financial year, despite 2013 guidance from the Government telling them translation and interpreting should be used in emergency cases only, for instance child protection. Among the biggest spenders was the London Borough of Haringey, paying £232,592 for interpreters and £16,444 for written translations, mostly Turkish, Polish and Spanish. Sheffield City Council spent £226,280 on interpreters and £47,644 on translation into 61 languages. Government data shows HMRC spends £1 million a year on providing tax advice in different languages. Some of the spending is required by law, however. A massive £15.5 million was paid out last year by the Ministry of Justice for interpreters in court cases, as the European Convention on Human Rights requires. Police and the Crown Prosecution Service spent £16 million between them as the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) requires that suspects understand the questions put to them by officers. The Metropolitan Police was the biggest spender – getting through £6.7 million in 2013-14. A spokesman said: 'The MPS has a legal obligation to provide interpreting.' Private companies that make money from taxpayer-funded interpreting services include outsourcing giant Capita, California-based LanguageLine and thebigword. In many cases interpreters work from home or in call centres, and translate in three-way phone conversations with foreign-language speakers and doctors or police. If you go to see a doctor in France, Germany and Poland, nobody will provide you with an interpreter . If you go to see a doctor in France, Germany and Poland, nobody will provide you with an interpreter. I was talking to my sister about this the other day. She lives in Italy and says if you go to a doctor there and you speak the language, fine. If not, well too bad. You communicate with your hands. The situation in Britain regarding translators must be unique. I have been a Polish translator in England since 2008. When I started it was really, really busy. I would have three cases a day. I was working day and night. I have less work now, but I think that’s mainly because there are so many more interpreters. In some ways it is surprising that more Poles than any other nationals require interpreters here. Most Polish nationals – specially the younger generation – learn English at college. Some hospitals or GP surgeries use telephone interpreters but from my experience it doesn’t really work. Take NHS cases. Patients sometimes want you to be there when they are given local anaesthetic. I’m next to the patient and the doctor with the scalpel, so sometimes you see things that could make you faint. For me the most exciting projects are crown courts. A year ago we did quite a big murder trial in Carlisle – it lasted for a month and a half, lots of defendants. We had all those reports, pathologists’ reports, so this was very demanding stuff. I was born in Poland. My great-great-grandfather was British. He moved to Poland. When I was in high school I went to America, then finished my degree in Poland and came here, completed an interpreting diploma and started my career. I am a freelance, self-employed interpreter on the books of Capita. The pay is £16 to £22 an hour. There is no guarantee of work – we wait for an email or phone call with a job offer. There are weeks when there is work every day. We never know, it’s such an unpredictable profession. When Poland joined the EU in 2004 I knew there would be a huge wave of Poles coming here: it’s hardly surprising when you think about the economic situation in Poland, the low wages. People who do manual labour or work in factories can live comfortably here even if they earn the minimum wage, whereas in Poland this is impossible. Britain is still such a wealthy and prosperous country.","Police, hospitals and courts are all spending huge sums on translators .

"As if Hollywood hasn't had enough leaks of late. For a short time on Friday night, the official website of Sunday's Golden Globe Awards posted what appeared to be this year's winners in two top Globes categories, setting off some momentary excitement in the industry trade press. Selma and Into The Woods were named as the two top winners for the 72nd annual Golden Globes, which are set for Sunday night. Scroll Down for Video . Whoops?!

"Disney is known for animated characters on the stage and screen but now Disney can even create pictures in the sand! Research Disney's latest creation is BeachBot, an autonomous robot that draws pictures on the beach using state of the art technology. The adorable orange and tan bot was modeled to look like a turtle by the students and a research team at the University of Zurich and sketches images on the beach by dragging seven pins in the sand a bit like a rake, reports TechCrunch. Scroll down for video . BeachBot: Research Disney's latest creation is BeachBot, an autonomous robot that draws pictures on the beach using state of the art technology . Big reprtoire: The robot may either be controlled manually or the artist can send it a file image to replicate . The BeachBot is 60 cm in length and 40 cm in both width and height. It has a three wheel arrangement with differential drive back wheels and also has a steering wheel in the front. What seems like it may be complicated drawing process takes just a few minutes to prepare. The artist in charge of the robot sets down poles in the sand to tell the robot the space in which it may draw. The robot may either be controlled manually or the artist can send it a file image to replicate. Stichkingdom reports that the lines the rakes create can be as thin as 2 inches or as wide as 16 inches. Using a mounted laser scanner and the special reflected poles the robot creates a map of its drawing field and then it begins to play. Some previously drawn images are of a fish, a slower, and a variety of geometric shapes. As long as the artist can draw it, BeachBot can draw it too. 'The BeachBot is not just a lifeless, mechanical being; it is a friendly looking creature with a soul,' says the robot's official website.

"A woman who ‘rescued’ what she thought was a stray kitten ended up in court after selling the animal. Mother-of-four Suzanne Gilmore, 30, found the £400 pedigree Siamese kitten under a bush and took it back to her Blackpool home.

"An outraged all-girls private school student has claimed her yearbook photo was heavily retouched without her permission and now claims it looks like her 'prettier twin sister'. The student from the private St Teresa's Academy in Kansas City, Missouri, was furious when she saw the image as she believed it was beyond recognition. She initially noticed the perceived problems with her picture when students were given their new ID cards - the images from which will be used in their end-of-year publication. In response the teenager vented her anger by positing on Reddit, claiming that the pictures had been edited 'past smoothing out blemishes'. Other pupils were also horrified at the changes, claiming that they had been made to look 'slimmer' on their cheek and face and had freckles removed from their nose. Before and after: The student, believed to be from St Teresa's Aacademy in Kansas City, Missouri, was furious when she saw the image that would be put in her yearbook was touched up without her permission . 'I go to an all girls high school and today every senior got a new student ID. We had gotten one in the beginning of the school year and we were all unsure as to why we were given a second. After closer inspection we realized that our photos had be retouched far past smoothing out blemishes. The student then listed what she believed had been done to the image including: Face smoothing, skin recoloring, lip recoloring, eyebrow smoothing and reshaping, and face thinning . The post continued: 'I was outraged! I have a round face that I have grown to love and now I get my photo back with a different face. The new photo no longer even looks like me but rather a prettier twin sister. 'When we go and have our photos taken we are flat out told that our skin will be retouched to hide blemishes. We are not told, however, that more drastic changes are made. 'Going to an all girls school we are constantly reminded about positive body image and accepting ourselves for who we are. Having these changes made to make me appear thinner makes me wonder how must our school practices what they preach.' The girl then met with her officials from her high school faculty who agreed that the untouched photos would be used in the yearbook. The girl added: 'When our yearbook teacher saw the photos he was outraged along with all the other staff members of the school. They understood that the new edited photos are not what the students look like. Response: The Catholic private school has said they did not ask for the photos to be edited and, following a meeting with students, have agreed to use the originals in the end-of-year publication . 'I would like to thank all of the positive comments about how wrong this is and how there need to be changes in this. My school has proved that they are fully behind positive body image by printing the untouched photos.'

Senior Lily O’Neill, 17, a member of the yearbook staff told the Kansas City Star: 'My face was slimmer. My cheeks were slimmer. My neck was slimmer. … I didn’t have any freckles on my nose. In response to the allegations, St. Teresa’s President Nan Tiehen Bone told the Star that it was a mistake on behalf of the photo company, DeCloud Studios. She added that the school actually dissuades their students from wearing too much make up. Susan Hoefer, from the DeCloud, admitted that an error had been made in the processing. She told the paper: 'It’s very simple. The IDs were run through an automated retouching program, which they shouldn’t have been.

"Families were evacuated from a hotel at Disneyland Paris yesterday, amid fears that a shooter was on the loose in the theme park. There were separate reports of gunfire outside a synagogue in the city's 19th district yesterday morning, and another potential hostage situation at a pharmacy in Jaures.

A Euro Disney spokesman told MailOnline: ‘At 11.30am Paris time on Saturday, January 10, the Sequoia Lodge Hotel at Disneyland Paris was briefly evacuated following a security incident, which turned out to be a false alarm. ‘As a precaution a number of guests were taken into the hotel car park as is usual resort procedure. ‘The whole process, which mainly concerned the lobby area, lasted less than an hour, with the safety cordon lifted quickly and the rest of the resort was not affected in any way.' France's President has warned its citizens to remain vigilant in the wake of a brutal attack on the Charlie Hebdo magazine, the fatal shooting of a policewoman and a deadly showdown between a hostage-taker and police at a Jewish supermarket. The French Defence Ministry has placed 500 extra soldiers on patrol around Paris to calm nerves in the wake of the attacks. Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said France will keep its highest possible security level in the greater Paris area.

"The mother of a 22-year-old jailed for a horrific hammer attack on his abusive father has begged for him to be released from prison after he saved her from another beating. Tracey Wilson, 43, said 'it doesn't feel like justice,' after her son Ben Wilson was jailed for six years for battering his father with a lump hammer. The attack left her 46-year-old husband, Craig   - who had a long history of assaulting her - with brain damage and holes in his head. Tracey Wilson, 43, pictured with her son Ben, 22, has called for his release from jail after he saved her  from his 'Jekyll and Hyde' father . Mrs Wilson said she was 'so proud' of her son for defending her, the Daily Mirror reported. 'What he did was only to help me and it is terrible he is now in jail,' she told the newspaper . 'To see him getting a long sentence was devastating.' Wilson was jailed for six years Teesside Crown Court after admitting wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, but the sentence has sparked outrage. Thousands of people have signed a petition calling for Benjamin Wilson to be freed. The 'Free Ben Wilson' e-petition has more than 40,000 signatures from around the world, and a 'Help Free Ben Wilson' Facebook page has more than 14,000 likes. The petition, which was set up by Marie Taylor, who said: 'Ben got 6 years for protecting his mother and himself from an abusive man under the influence of alcohol. 'Ben has recently become a father and is not going to be able to bring his child up and give him a better life than what he was brought up in. 'Save this boy from more years of [torture] he has suffered enough and his family.' Ben Wilson, pictured above in this police mug shot, was jailed for six years by a judge at Teeside Crown Court earlier this week . The 22-year-old, of Billingham, County Durham, who is a new father himself, had grown up in 'an atmosphere of violence, fear and intimidation' and was subjected to violence himself. Wilson's father was described in court as a 'Jekyll and Hyde' character and a 'violent nasty drunk', who once served a two-year sentence for assaulting his wife. During that assault on New Year's Eve 2007, the 46-year-old put both hands around his wife's neck and pressed so hard her eyes bled and she passed out. Anita Homer added: 'This is appalling!!! We have a wonky, unfair and non standardised jurisdiction. 'There are so many cases where a person has intentionally killed someone and only received very short sentences. 'This lad's behaviour was not intentional. He only wanted to protect his mom.'","Ben Wilson was jailed for six years for the hammer attack on his father .

"British scientists have embarked on a mission worthy of Willy Wonka – to save the world’s chocolate supplies. With global demand for chocolate soaring and disease ravaging crops in the world’s biggest cocoa-producing countries, the scientists are battling to develop hardier and more productive cocoa plants. The Mail on Sunday has been given exclusive access to the epicentre of the British effort to save chocolate: a high-security £1 million greenhouse in Berkshire. Growing challenge: Professor Paul Hadley at the International Cocoa Quarantine Centre in Berkshire . Boom: The aim is to ensure global chocolate supply keeps up with growing demand. Above, one specemine . Here, a team from Reading University is hard at work on the project – dubbed ‘Operation Wonka’ after the character Willy Wonka in Roald Dahl’s classic children’s book Charlie And The Chocolate Factory. The ‘Willy Wonka’ of the operation is Paul Hadley, a professor of horticulture, who explains that the ‘Chocolate Factory’, or International Cocoa Quarantine Centre, was set up to ensure that the global supply of chocolate can keep up with booming demand, which is being fuelled by the sweet-toothed Chinese. He said: ‘Our aim is to provide new genetic plant material for cocoa-producers which will help them by giving them better-quality and more productive cocoa beans. The drive is to find disease-resistant and highest yielding varieties.’ Most of the chocolate eaten in Britain is made from cocoa beans produced in Ghana and Ivory Coast in West Africa. But a virus called cocoa swollen shoot and an insect called a mirid are devastating crops there. Inspiration: The project is dubbed 'Operation Wonka' after the classic Roald Dahl character. Above, Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka in 2005 . Prof Hadley says the producers in West Africa want to try new varieties grown in Venezuela and Indonesia, but they don’t want to run the risk of introducing diseases and pests associated with those crops. ‘This is where we have a pivotal position,’ added Prof Hadley. ‘We receive a South American variety and quarantine it here for three months to ensure it is disease-free. We then grow, observe and test the plants for two years, and when we are happy the variety is safe, we send a cutting to Ghana. These are then propagated. ‘Without this facility there is a real danger people might be tempted to sidestep the safe movement routes for plants and bring in a plant that could destroy their crops.’ In the 11,000 sq ft greenhouse in Berkshire, 400 different types of cocoa plant are being nurtured. The plants, which are between 7ft and 9ft tall, are arranged in rows in a polythene-roofed hothouse where temperatures are kept at tropical levels. More than 1,000 gallons of water a day are pumped over the plants by an automatic system and a close eye is kept on them for signs of disease. Plants are also monitored for growth rates and pod yields. The ‘chocolate factory’ costs £160,000 a year to operate, with half of its funding provided by the US Department of Agriculture. The rest comes from the Cocoa Research Association (CRA) – a consortium of chocolate traders and manufacturers. CRA chairman Tony Lass said: ‘We are all very proud that Britain, a chocolate-loving nation, is taking on this important role to ensure a better future for cocoa-producers and chocolate supplies.’ High cost: The ‘chocolate factory’, based in a £1million greenhouse, costs £160,000 a year to operate .

"This time last year Regane MacColl was excitedly planning her future. After achieving good grades in her Higher exams, the popular ‘fun-loving’ schoolgirl had applied to university with dreams of becoming a lawyer. Her proud family had just welcomed her back from a charitable mission to help orphaned children in Africa – for which she raised thousands of pounds - and she had been invited to talk at an event alongside MSPs. But on a night out with friends at the Arches Nightclub in Glasgow in early February, the 17-year-old fell victim to Scotland’s deadly ‘party drug’ culture. Hard-working: Regane  MaColl was a fun-loving teen who adored her family . Her death from ecstasy sent shockwaves across the country – and her distraught family were left asking ‘why?’ Now, for the first time, her parents have spoken publicly about the tragedy and paid tribute to ‘a girl who brought a smile to everyone she met’. In an exclusive interview with the Scottish Mail on Sunday on the eve of the anniversary of Regane’s death, her father Alastair MacColl and mother Vicki Lenaghan revealed their horror at finding out she had been rushed to hospital, the anxious wait for news and the boundless grief when the teen lost her fight for life. They also issued an emotional warning about the trail of destruction left behind by drugs and urged fellow parents to ‘talk honestly to their kids’. ‘People always think it will never happen to them – but it can,’ Mr MacColl, 43, said. ‘There is nothing worse than losing a child and I hate to think of other families going through the pain we have experienced this past year. ‘I would ask parents to sit down with their kids and be honest with them about how dangerous trying drugs just once can be. Perfect daughter: Regane as a child with her mother Vicki. Her parents still do not know exactly what happened in the hours leading up to Regane’s death . ‘If anyone could see the devastation it can cause before they take something they would think twice.’ Miss Lenaghan, 42, said: ‘Our lives will never be the same. We will have to live with this pain for the rest of our days. ‘Time goes on but this cannot be healed.’ Her parents still do not know exactly what happened in the hours leading up to Regane’s death but toxicology reports showed she had the class A drug MDMA – found in ecstasy tablets – in her system. Doctors fought for hours in an attempt to save the 17-year-old - a sixth year pupil at St Peter the Apostle High School in Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire - after she collapsed at the late night club venue but she died later that day with her parents at her bedside. In the weeks surrounding the tragedy, police put out repeated warnings to young people to beware of a particularly strong strain of ecstasy known as Mortal Kombat. The red coloured pills, which are stamped with a dragon logo, were linked to the hospitalisations of three other young people at that time. However her parents never considered that their studious and responsible eldest child might find herself in a position where she would try drugs. ‘It was just not like her’, Miss Lenaghan said. ‘She had never given us reason to worry by coming home really late or really drunk and was the responsible one in her group.’ Mr MacColl continued: ‘We never felt the need to explicitly warn her not to do it. We could talk about anything with her and, of course, drugs and their dangers came up but we never felt we had to sit her down and tell her ‘do not do that tonight’.’ Regane, pictured with her father Alastair. He said: ‘People always think it will never happen to them but it can' They learned she was in trouble after Miss Lenaghan received a worried phone call from her nephew who was inside the ambulance with Regane in the early hours of February 2 last year. ‘I was in bed when I got a call in the middle of the night from Regane’s cousin who was in the ambulance with her,’ Miss Lenaghan said. ‘He said she wasn’t well and was going to hospital and that I needed to come quickly. It is all a blur but I remember thinking that maybe she had suffered an asthma attack or had drunk too much alcohol. ‘I called her dad and we all headed to the hospital. At no point did we realise how serious it was. We all hoped she would be ok.’ Mr MacColl added: ‘We still do not know exactly what happened inside the Arches. We know she became separated from her friends and that at the end of the night she became very unwell. ‘We were told that Regane’s body had taken a reaction to a substance and learned that some other young people who had been in the club had been hospitalised after apparently taking Mortal Kombat ecstasy pills. ‘One thing we do know is that our daughter was not a regular drug user.’ Regane’s heartbroken mother is determined she be remembered ‘not for how she died, but who she was’. ‘She was a fun-loving and caring girl. She was smart and vivacious and was just starting to spread her wings in the world,’ Miss Lenaghan said. ‘When people think of her, we want them to recall how much potential she had and how much she achieved so much in a short space of time. Caring: Regane with children during her charity visit to Tanzania before her death . ‘She had just submitted her applications to university to study law. ‘She did some work experience with in our local court and absolutely loved it so applied to the law schools at Strathclyde University and Stirling University. ‘She did well in her Higher exams in 5th year, particularly in English which she had a real natural ability for, and was studying Advanced Highers in English, politics and sociology. She had such a promising future ahead of her.’ One of Regane’s most impressive achievements was being selected from dozens of other young people to go to Africa with The Twende Pamoja Trust — a charity which aims to build relationships between communities in Tanzania and the UK. There she visited schools and orphanages to teach them about Scottish culture and saw first-hand how the money raised for the cause was helping disadvantaged children. Mr MacColl said: ‘She spent three weeks in Tanzania with the most basic of facilities, visiting schools and an orphanage. ‘We were worried she would struggle with it all, as she was a girl who liked to look good and was used to comfortable surroundings, but she surprised everyone. She took to it like a duck to water. ‘She had grown up so much when she returned. She was less bothered about material things and how she looked and was so much more confident. ‘She worked so hard to raise money for the charity, which has links with her school, and had been offered the chance to return this year.’ Miss Lenaghan said: ‘That was the first time she had been away from her family for such a long time and we struggled not being able to contact her for the first ten days. We worried about her, as all parents do. Police put out repeated warnings to young people of Mortal Kombat ecstasy pills, which were linked to the hospitalisations of three other young people at that time . ‘Now, ten days without her does not seem long at all.’ She added: ‘Family was always incredibly important to Regane. She put her family first and was a great big sister. It hurts so much that her siblings won’t have her as an influence any more. ‘So many people have been left devastated by her death, her parents, step parents, brothers, sister, cousins, aunts, uncles, grandparents, friends, colleagues, teachers.’ The support of family, friends and their local community in Clydebank, Dunbartonshire have helped over the past 12 months but Regane’s parents’ pain still remains ‘very raw’. Miss Lenaghan said: ‘We are still in total disbelief. ‘It doesn’t feel real. If my phones rings I still think it might be her. I still hope she will walk into the kitchen with that beautiful smile and tell me a funny story about her day. Mr MacColl said: ‘I could look at her photographs for hours and it feels like she is there with me.’ Despite separating when Regane was very young, her parents remain close and have supported each other through the most difficult stages of grief. As well as her parents, Regane also had a particularly strong bond with her younger brothers Ben, Leo and Aaron, little sister Sophie and her step-parents. Her step-mother Clare MacColl said: ‘Her brothers and sisters still talk about her all the time. It is hard to hear because we are still hurting but also lovely because they are keeping her memory alive. They keep us going and tell us that Regane would not want us to be sad. ‘Regane shared a room with her little sister Sophie, who is 10, and recently she has been struggling because she doesn’t have her to talk to. ‘She’s growing up and there are things that she wouldn’t want to tell her parents but that Regane would have helped her with. She recently wrote a letter to Regane in her diary and it was heart-breaking.’ December 8 last year would have been Regane’s 18th birthday and keen to mark the date ‘how she would have wanted’ her family got together to celebrate her life. Miss Lenaghan said: ‘She was looking forward to turning 18 so much. It is such a milestone for teenagers. ‘It was hard but we wanted to mark it and celebrate for her. We all got together and went to her graveside. It was covered with flowers and birthday cards from her friends, which really touched us. Her brothers and sister let off doves and we all shared stories. ‘All her school friends have been celebrating their 18th and going off to university. ‘It is very bittersweet for us because we are so happy for them – we watched them grow up alongside Regane – but it hurts so much that our daughter cannot join them.’","After achieving good grades, popular schoolgirl had applied to university .

"Jewelry giant Tiffany & Co. has joined other big-name brands and featured, for the first time, a same sex couple in their new advertising campaign. The campaign, titled 'Will You?', features seven portrait scenes of different couples and was shot by Peter Lindbergh. But it's one frame featuring two men on a New York stoop that really sticks out. While some high-profile models appear elsewhere in the campaign, the company chose the two men because they are dating in real life, Tiffany spokeswoman Linda Buckley told CNN. A break in tradition: Iconic jewelry label Tiffany & Co. are using this photo of a same-sex couple as the headline of their new 2015 advertising campaign, which is called 'Will You?' 'Nowadays, the road to marriage is no longer linear,' Buckley told the network. 'True love can happen more than once with love stories coming in a variety of forms.' Attached to the photo of the men, which will appear in magazines, it says: 'Will you promise to never stop completing my sentences or singing off-key, which I’m afraid you do often? And will you let today be the first sentence of one long story that never, ever ends?' The other photos in the series depict couples in varying stages of their relationships. Models such as Andreea Diaconu, Joséphine Le Tutour, Luca Gadjus and Cora Emmanuel appear in those photos, according to Fashion Times. StyleCaster writer Perrie Samotin said the campaign is a clever move in a financial sense. Celebration: The jewelry giant says the campaign acknowledges that 'love stories come in a variety of forms' Iconic: The 178-year-old brand is best known for its blue boxes . Will You?: Tiffany says it is their first campaign to feature a same sex couple . '(The campaign) honors the idea that love transcends age, race and gender—a sentiment most of us can surely get behind,' Samotin wrote. 'Although it shouldn’t even be an issue, it’s obviously important—both socially and financially—for brands to diversify their target consumers, and paying attention to the LGBTQ community is key.' But Tiffany, known for its traditionalism and perfectly-wrapped blue boxes, are far from the first to take such a step. In some aspects they are a few years late. J. Crew broke the mold in 2011 when it featured one of their designers and his partner in a catalog. Gap then erected a billboard emblazoned with a same-sex couple the following year. Banana Republic did the same thing last year. Then earlier this year, Barney's New York used 17 transgender men and women for its ad campaign. Pioneering: Earlier this year, Barneys New York used 17 transgender men and women in their 2014 campaign . 'Our goal was to convey the strength, beauty and courage of these extraordinary individuals through the iconic photographs and films of Bruce Weber, as well as the insightful writing of Patricia Bosworth,' Barneys creative director Dennis Freedman told Fashion Times. 'Great progress has been made in regards to the lesbian, gay and bisexual community. 'Unfortunately, the struggle for transgender equality continues. 'In the end, it is our hope that that we can make a difference through this campaign.'","New 2015 campaign from iconic jeweler features real-life New York couple .

"Colin Ferrie is being sued for negligence by the family of a 14-year-old epilepsy patient, it emerged last night. News of the legal action comes after the consultant was suspended from clinical work at Leeds General Infirmary following our revelations last week. The teenager’s family, who have asked not to be identified, complain that instead of referring the boy for surgery at the earliest possible stage in his illness, Dr Ferrie put him on a succession of about 15 strong drugs that has left him with the mental age of a toddler. Dr Colin Ferrie, circled, is being sued for negligence by the family of a 14-year-old epilepsy patient . The child’s mother said she was ‘deeply disturbed’ to learn that Dr Ferrie had been filmed snorting cocaine and taking GHB. She said that she was 'still physically shaking from reading it' The boy’s mother lost faith with Dr Ferrie and instead took her son to Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, where she was told he was a prime candidate for surgery that would help stop up to 150 seizures a day. The youngster finally had the operation in August 2013. The child’s mother said she was ‘deeply disturbed’ to learn that Dr Ferrie had been filmed snorting cocaine and taking GHB. ‘Shocked does not even cover it,’ she told The Mail on Sunday. ‘I am still physically shaking now from reading it. It’s horrendous.’ Her son has a rare form of epilepsy called Doose syndrome, which causes him to fall to the floor without warning. He was having about 150 fits a day when Dr Ferrie first began treating him. She says her son ‘should have had this surgery when he was five or six years old after the third or fourth medication did not work’. On call: An hour after Dr Colin Ferrie was filmed snorting cocaine and taking the powerful sedative and date-rape drug GHB, Leeds General Infirmary, above, confirmed he was on call for his vulnerable young patients . The family originally asked for a second opinion in 2007, presenting the request in writing to Dr Ferrie during an appointment. ‘He screwed it up and put it in the bin,’ she said. ‘Years later, we were still not happy – my son was getting worse and worse.’ She launched a clinical negligence claim in November 2013. Her lawyers are now compiling a dossier on the family’s complaints. Last night, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust confirmed Dr Ferrie had been treating the boy and issued a brief statement which read: ‘We can confirm we have been approached by the family’s legal representatives for information about care provided by the Trust.’ Dr Ferrie said he did not want to comment, referring The Mail on Sunday to the Medical Defence Union, a body that advises doctors on negligence claims. An MDU spokesman said: ‘He cannot give his side of the story because he has a duty of patient confidentiality.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Dr Colin Ferrie is being sued by family of 14-year-old epilepsy patient .

"A series of emails  leaked by journalists at Al Jazeera English reveal a divide among staff regarding the news organisation's coverage of the Charlie Hebdo massacre. In the exchange, some staff members brand the satirical magazine as 'racist' and 'extremist,' over the publication of controversial cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad. While others defended Charlie Hebdo's decision, saying that it needed to be done to ensure that the 'violent' do not have control over 'liberal civilization'. Scroll down for video . 'Alienating': One of the emails urged staff to discuss the potentially divisive 'Je suis Charlie' slogan. The phrase has been used to unite those standing in solidarity with the victims. Above, rally in Clermont-Ferrand . The publication of the exchange comes as the first pictures of three of the four hostages killed in yesterday's kosher supermarket siege in Paris have emerged. Meanwhile, there are reports that the wife of the Paris supermarket gunman - named France's most wanted woman - may already be in Syria. In an email sent out to staff on Thursday, London-based editor and executive producer Salah-Aldeen Khadr, suggests a list of questions that should guide the channel's coverage of the attack. He starts by explaining that the email is intended to ensure that the channel's 'coverage is the best it can be', according to the National Review, who has published the emails in full. Khadr urged his employees to question if the terrorist attack was 'really an attack on free speech,' asking whether an 'attack by 2-3 guys' on 'a controversial magazine' was equal to a 'civilizational attack on European values'. He goes on to ask staff members to discuss whether 'I am Charlie' - a slogan used to unite those standing in solidarity with the terror victims - was 'alienating', creating an 'us and them' mentality. 'Extremist': London-based editor and executive producer Salah-Aldeen Khadr suggests framing the attack on the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris, pictured above, as a 'clash of extremist fringes' Khadr explains that people can be 'against CH [Charlie Hebdo] racism and also against murdering people'. Finally, he states that the massacre should be viewed as 'a clash of extremist fringes', apparently referring to the Islamic fundamentalists on one side and the team at Charlie Hebdo on the other. The email sparked a heated debate among its recipients. Just hours after it was sent, U.S.-based correspondent Tom Ackerman responded by quoting an excerpt of a New York Times article by Ross Douthat. It read: 'If a large enough group of someone is willing to kill you for saying something, then it's something that almost certainly needs to be said, because otherwise the violent have veto power over liberal civilization.' This prompted a response from Qatar-based Mohamed Vall Salem, who reported for Al Jazeera's Arab-language channel before joining its English wing in 2006. He said that 'what Charlie Hebdo did was not free speech', adding that 'it was an abuse of free speech in my opinion'. He urged colleagues to take another look at the cartoons, explaining it was not 'what they said' but 'how they said it'. Ending his email, he wrote: 'I condemn those heinous killings, but I'M NOT CHARLIE'. Senior Paris correspondent Jacky Rowland wrote a simple response to her colleagues, saying '#journalismisnotacrime.' The exchange concludes with a response from Roving reporter Omar Al Saleh: 'First I condemn the brutal killing. But I AM NOT CHARLIE.' 'Journalism is not a crime... insultism is not journalism.. and not doing journalism properly is crime.' A spokesman from Al Jazeera told MailOnline: 'We have arguably the most diverse newsroom in the world, and the robustness of our internal discussions that flow from this are a great strength. 'Viewers judge us on our actual output - on the horrific story in Paris our coverage has been first class, relaying events in real time, all the while providing expert context and analysis from across the spectrum.'","Emails reportedly linked by Al Jazeera staff show conflicting viewpoints .

"Britain’s worst mass poisoning of modern times may have left six children from one family with lifelong disabilities. The Matta family live near Camelford, North Cornwall, where a huge quantity of aluminium sulphate poisoned the water supply 26 years ago. And of the seven children in the family, six have disabilities. Plight: The Matta children (top row left-right) Louie, two, Katie, 10, Sofie, 11, holding baby D'Arcy, 12 weeks, and Luke, six. Front row (left-right) Harry, four, and Olivia, eight . Last month, a Mail on Sunday special report revealed that three deaths have been linked to the incident. And now, Christopher Exley, a professor in bioinorganic chemistry at Keele University, who has investigated the deaths, has been contacted by Sarah Matta and her husband Paul who believe their family has been blighted by the poisoning. The incident happened in July 1988 when a relief tanker driver accidentally dumped 20 tons of aluminium sulphate – a chemical used to keep drinking water clear – directly into the water supply instead of into a storage tank at Camelford’s Lowermoor water treatment works. As a ten-year-old, Sarah unwittingly drank the heavily contaminated water. Christopher Exley, a professor in bioinorganic chemistry at Keele University, is investigating the deaths . The eldest of the couple’s children, Sophie, 11, was born 15 years after the event. The youngest affected child, Louie, is two. For years the couple have  struggled to understand why their children – two of whom use wheelchairs – have problems including delayed development, anxiety issues, speech problems and possible autism. In 2012, a blood test found that Mrs Matta had aluminium levels in her blood 20 times higher than normal. Professor Exley said: ‘Could that impact on her children? It could. ‘Aluminium is toxic. Studies in  animals show that if you feed  mothers aluminium in the water supply, the offspring will exhibit developmental problems.’ He fears hundreds of children born . since 1988 to the 20,000 people estimated to have drunk the contaminated . water could also be at risk. He . said: ‘Everybody wants to know if there are people who were affected at . the time who still have higher than normal levels of aluminium  in . their bodies. 'If they have had children since then, there’s a chance those children have been affected as well.’ Mrs . Matta, 36, has not visited Camelford since 1998 – even though she lives . just a short drive away in Bodmin. She said: ‘I have nothing against . the people, but it holds so many unhappy memories for me.’ Six . of her children – Sophie, 11; Katie, ten; Olivia, eight; Luke, six; . Harry, four; and Louie, two – have a condition called Ehlers-Danlos . Syndrome (EDS). A relief tanker driver in Camelford (pictured) accidentally dumped 20 tons of aluminium sulphate - used to keep drinking water clear - into the water supply instead of a storage tank at Lowermoor waterworks in 1988 .

"A man has revealed his horrifying childhood as a five-year-old sex slave in Florida, where he says a member of his family made thousands forcing him to indulge the pedophile desires of pillars of the local community. Jerome Elam said that he was taken advantage of by a relative, who kept him in servitude for seven years and made him participate in child pornography and take drugs. He said that clients of his trafficker would beat, choke and rape him - and punish him severely whenever he tried to escape his life of abuse. Elam told local station WTLV how he was dragged in and out of school in Jacksonville to fulfill the whims of his relatives' clients, whom he claims were often doctors and lawyers with a 'darker side'. Sex slave: Jerome Elam, pictured above as a boy in the 1970s, said he was trafficked, choked and raped by members and clients of a pedophile ring operating in Florida . He said: 'I would be pulled out of school at times and what they would do is they would set up a list of clients and this would take place in hotels, in campers, in store rooms, whatever location they chose we would be forced to go to.' 'There was no depth of depravity these people had, so it was a very lucrative business... They looked like the people you would see in church on Sunday. 'These were doctors and lawyers and people who were well respected but the darker side of them were never exposed until they got into the after hours trafficking part of it.' In a first-person account for the Communities Digital News website, Elam told how he was subjected to beatings and rape by each member of a pedophile ring before he was turned over to the clients. He wrote: 'My indoctrination to the “group,” as they often referred to themselves in private, consisted of being raped and beaten by each member... Today: Elam said he is sharing his horrific story so that other victims will see there is hope for their future . 'Children were choked unconscious to satisfy the twisted sexual appetites of a select few of the members, and many clients of the trafficking ring also shared this sick practice. He also said that his 'handlers' would take revenge on him if he tried to escape or alert anybody to his plight. Elam wrote that he was beaten and had three of his ribs broken after he tried to tell a doctor what was happening to him. According to child abuse experts, pimps can make as much as $200,000 per year from a single child, and often have as many as six under their control at any given time. Elam said that he escaped and was able to build a new life for himself after a suicide attempt left him in hospital and gave him the opportunity to escape. He said he is sharing his story to encourage other victims of sex trafficking to realize that they can reclaim their lives.","Jerome Elam said he was forced into sexual slavery as a young boy .

"Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow cabinet office minister, accused the coalition of 'electioneering at the tax payers expense' The coalition has been accused of 'electioneering at the tax payers expense' after launching a multimillion pound newspaper and television assault to promote its policies, it has been reported. The Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats are said to be using public money to fund campaigns that highlight their Help to Buy Scheme and superfast broadband. Other adverts were said to include those raising awareness of healthy school meals and improvements to the health service. 'Ministers need to justify this immediately,' Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow cabinet office minister, told The Times. 'This looks like shameless electioneering at taxpayers' expense.' The Government's Help to Buy 30 second advert reached a prime time television audience after appearing during the hit ITV series Broadchurch starring David Tennant. A spokesman for the Treasury told the MailOnline that the advertisement, that is set to run for three months, has been paid for by the banks. 'For the scheme to support homebuyers across the UK, as many people as possible need to know how it works and understand if they are eligible,' said the spokesman. 'That's why the Government have developed a targeted public information campaign. The costs are funded by fees paid by the mortgage lenders under the scheme, not the taxpayer. 'So far, Help to Buy has helped 71,000 people realise their home owning aspirations, and is a key part of our long term economic plan that has ensured that first-time home buyers in 2014 rose to their highest level since 2007.'

"A man who spent 21 years in prison for murder had his conviction overturned today - and says he lost decades behind bars because of a crooked cop. Derrick Hamilton, 49, was imprisoned for supposedly murdering Nathaniel Cash in 1991, but has always been adamant he had nothing to do with it. Instead, he says, he was locked up because former NYPD detective Louis Scarcella intimidated a woman into claiming she witnessed him shoot Cash dead. Exonerated: Derrick Hamilton, 49, was wrongfully convicted of a 1991 murder - and has only now had formal recognition that he was innocent all along . Family: Hamilton, pictured above holding his daughter outside court in Brooklyn, said was paroled three years ago and got a job as a paralegal even before the exoneration . Cash’s girlfriend, Jewel Smith, told a court that she saw Hamilton kill her boyfriend, but later recanted. A review of evidence in the case showed that Cash was shot in the back – while Smith’s testimony said he was hit in the chest. Ballistic analysis also showed that more than one gun had been fired, ABC7 reported. Hamilton today held his young daughter in his arms as he spoke to reporters outside of a Brooklyn courthouse. He said: ‘One day in prison is too much for an innocent man. [Today is] exhilarating. It's a grateful day.’ He was paroled in 2011, and got a job as a paralegal, but was only formally cleared of the murder on Friday. In 'Crooked cop': Hamilton, pictured above in court, says that former NYPD officer Louis Scarcella intimidated murder victim Nathaniel Cash's girlfriend into saying she saw him kill the victim . Joy: Hamilton, who said he is 'grateful' for the overturned conviction, hugged attorneys in court after the judge made his decision . Hamilton wore a baseball cap which said ‘wrongfully convicted’ on the front, and on the side said ‘victims of Detective Scarcella’. He is the fourth man to be exonerated in an investigation Scarcella contributed to, the New York Daily News reported. According to the News, Hamilton admitted he was ‘bitter’ about his years in jail, but said he is coming to terms with it. He added his first priority is to ‘party, party, party’. However, lawyers for Detective Scarcella issued a blanket denial that he had done anything to wrongfully convict anybody during his policing career. They said: ‘To date there has been no finding by any judge, nor has there been a statement by any prosecutor, to sustain the sensational claims that have appeared in the press that Detective Scarcella contributed to any person’s wrongful conviction’. Intimidation? Hamilton says detective Scarcella framed him - and the Brooklyn DA is looking into other Scarcella convictions to see whether they made need to be overturned as well .","Derrick Hamilton, 49, was convicted of 1991 murder .

Mr Keasey said: 'These are exactly the kinds of people who, in ordinary circumstances, we might never get to meet or chat to and so this event allows us to perhaps share our road safety vision in a setting where many car enthusiasts are receptive to what we've got to say.' He said it was important that motorists make the distinction between motorsport and 'posing a risk to others by driving at speed on the highway'. Police were also letting motorists try their 'ever-popular beer goggles', which help illustrate the dangers of driving while under the influence of alcohol.

"House of Lords restaurants lost almost £2million last year – leaving ordinary taxpayers to pick up the bill. The upper chamber’s controversial catering subsidy increased by £100,000 last year according to official figures released this week. The lavish subsidy allows peers to enjoy fine-dining at knock-down prices on the Parliamentary estate. Parliamentary authorities insiste that bills have been reduced by hundreds of thousands and prices in bars and restaurants have been increased to reduce the burden on the public purse . Overall, the taxpayer subsidy for the eight House of Lords bars and restaurants jumped from £1.85m to £1.95m between 2012/13 to 2013/14. The Peers' Dining Room alone required £886,996 of taxpayers’ money to keep going. The revelation has infuriated MPs, battling to win back public trust in Parliament after the expenses scandal. Labour MP John Mann said the House of Lords was ‘the most lavish retirement home in the country’. He said: ‘It is about time the Lords was cut down in size. I would abolish the whole house, but if they are not going to do that they should at least cut its cloth so it is in touch with the rest of austerity Britain.’ John O'Connell, of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, added: ‘David Cameron promised that the cost of politics would come down, but it is still far too high. ‘Taxpayers shouldn't be subsidising fancy catering in the House of Lords when we're trying to find savings everywhere else. It's absurd that this practice has survived in these tough financial times.’ The Lords catering subsidy allows peers to enjoy lavish meals far below the price ordinary families would have to pay elsewhere in central London. House of Lords restaurants lost almost £2million last year – leaving ordinary taxpayers to pick up the bill . In the exclusive Barry Room brasserie, peers can enjoy 'Prawn and lobster meat folded into Avugar caviar' with 'lemon mayonnaise, with tomato and cucumber salsa and grilled baby gem lettuce' for just £10. They can then dine on 'Squid ink linguine, served with sautéed mixed shellfish, roasted red peppers coulis, mixed with lemon and flat leaf parsley topped with parmesan shavings' for £9. Or if they prefer meat, peers can choose a 'grilled breast of guinea fowl, served with café au lait, sautéed kale and parsnip crisps' for £9.50 or a grilled minute steak for £10. A House of Lords spokesman said the upper chamber had cut its catering subsidy by 27 per cent since 2007 and said it was their aim ‘to halve the net cost of the catering and retail service by 2015/16’. He added: 'Our catering services meet the needs of a working House of Parliament and due to the unpredictable nature of sittings of the House, and periods where the House doesn’t sit and so revenue is not generated, a subsidy is unavoidable. 'We also pay all staff at least the London Living Wage and provide workplace pensions to our refreshment department staff. We are proud to do so but it means our costs are higher than some commercial restaurants.’ But it is not only the Lords which benefit from taxpayer subsidised dinners. Before MPs broke off for Christmas they enjoyed lavish lunches – including chargrilled partridge, salmon marinated in vodka and guinea fowl for the same price as a high street pizza. The meals are able to be offered for way below the going rate because taxpayers subsidise restaurant and bars across the Parliamentary estate. The Strangers' Dining Room - used by members to wine and dine guests - is serving chargrilled spatchcocked partridge with roast pear, squash and game chips for £9.25. Just a mile away from Parliament, ordinary members of the public have to pay £25 to dine on a roast leg of Partridge. Another seasonal item at the restaurant is the roast Norfolk turkey breast wrapped in smoked pancetta with piccolo parsnips, baby sprouts, chestnut stuffing, cranberry gel and bread sauce foam for £12. The fish menu includes confit halibut with lemon verbena, Anna potatoes, baby fennel, golden raisins and verjus for £15. In the Portcullis Cafeteria main courses include braised guinea fowl breast with baked fig and celeriac rosti with ginger sauce for £4 and baked fillet of salmon in puff pastry with a rich tomato sauce, roasted cherry tomatoes and basil for £4. In the exclusive Barry Room brasserie, peers can enjoy 'Prawn and lobster meat folded into Avugar caviar' Labour MP John Mann said the House of Lords was ‘the most lavish retirement home in the country’ MPs have been urged to end the £7million a year subsidy for food and drink in the House of Commons . At the Debate restaurant Christmas specials include grilled salmon fillet marinated in vodka and dill with vegetable tinsel for £4. The Churchill Dining Room offers salt-baked celeriac with pea velouté, poached hen's egg, puffed potato, toasted panko and popcorn shoots for £10. Parliamentary staff can also make use of the daily roast at the Members' Dining Room, where the fare includes traditional roast turkey with stuffing, pigs in blankets and cranberry sauce and mustard and honey glazed gammon with parsley sauce and sage and onion pudding. Peers were last month attacked after it emerged they had complained that their exclusive restaurants had become 'downmarket'. Members of the House of Lords are said to be angry that ordinary office workers with a Parliamentary pass are now allowed to join them at their taxpayer-subsidised dining areas. Lords catering officials allowed other people into the dining hall to cut the eye-watering subsidy. The exclusive Barry Room was turned into a brasserie where ordinary workers can now bring up to six guests. But one diner was left unimpressed – firing off a complaint against the 'downgrading' of the restaurants and 'the appalling search for mediocrity'. Other complaints — revealed under Freedom of Information rules — attacked the quality of food and angry staff. One lord said he could get better food in a 'down market establishment like Prezzo or Ask'. Another suggested the chef who had made a mushroom roll 'should be sent to Pizza Express or Zizzi and probably Cafe Rouge'. One peer even complained he would get a better-value breakfast for £36 at London's five-star Ritz Hotel.","EXCLUSIVE: Taxpayers subsidise  Lords restaurants by almost £2m a year .

"Five members of the same Virginia family - including a pregnant woman - have died after the car they were driving collided with an 18-wheeler on a Maryland Road early on Saturday morning. According to state police, the victims were Zarissa Ayres, 30, and her unborn child, Travis Straton, 25, Regina Ayres, 24, Jordan Ayres, 7 and Jonathan Ayres, who was two-months old. The family was traveling in a 2006 Suzuki Forenza when the crash happened and four of the five were declared dead at the scene. Tragedy: Zarissa Ayres, (left) and Regina Ayres, (right) died in the car crash on a Maryland freeway on Saturday morning .

The drive of the truck, Yvenet Mayette, 28, was also injured in the crash which happend at 1.15am on Saturday at the intersection of routes 50 and 313 in Wye Mills according to the Salisbury Daily Times. Awful: Regina Ayres, and her seven-year-old daughter Jordan passed away in the car crash . Police said there is no indication at this time that alcohol was a factor and they don’t know who was driving the car the family was in. Travis Straton, 25, the father of Jonathan Ayres, also was killed. He was from Onancock, Virginia. The truck slammed into the car on the passenger side and rolled over on the vehicle before coming to rest. The Ayers were returning home from Baltimore where they had visited family. Police say there was no snow at the time of the crash, but that temperatures were extremely low. The cause of the crash remains under investigation, and no charges have been filed so far. Snow and cold temperatures played a part in Friday's massive 200-vehicle pile up in Michigan that took the life of one man and left 22 people injured. Four of the five were pronounced dead at the scene of the Maryland crash, police said. Zerissa Ayres, who was pregnant, was transported by ambulance to Easton Memorial Hospital, where both she and her unborn child were pronounced dead.

"Flemming Rose was put on an Al Qaeda hit list after publishing a cartoon mocking the Prophet Mohammed . It was late on a Tuesday afternoon six years ago when the phone rang. A voice that had become familiar from Denmark’s Security and Intelligence Service said two men planning to assassinate me had been arrested in Chicago. The FBI had foiled another planned attack on my paper Jyllands-Posten, which specifically targeted myself and the cartoonist Kurt Westergaard. The terrorists turned out to be an American and a Canadian, both of Pakistani origin. One was linked to atrocities the previous year in Mumbai; he had already visited Denmark twice on planning missions and had purchased his ticket back to Copenhagen. A year later, Westergaard was fortunate to escape the next attempt on his life. The 73-year-old artist was watching a film with his young granddaughter when a Somali man with an axe broke in to his home to kill him. They dived into a safe room he had been forced to put in his house. His assailant was shot and captured by police. For a decade we have had to live in the shadow of such threats after I commissioned a dozen cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed. This was a decision that provoked a storm around the world, with republication of the cartoons in scores of other papers. Yet in spite of the assassination attempts, it was all too easy to be lulled into thinking the threat was abstract, as life continued. All that changed last week. People were killed in Paris because of cartoons mocking Islam. Our worst nightmare has come true. These murders challenge democracies in the most sickening style. They present a terrible threat to the free speech that is the foundation of true democracy. But the tragic events also expose our own hypocrisies, the delusions and evasion we take to keep peace in the short term, along with the destructive culture of grievance that politicians have been eager to exploit. I knew two of the killed cartoonists at Charlie Hebdo. I had appeared on a panel about threats to free speech with Stephane Charbonnier (aka Charb) and worked on a comic project with Georges Wolinski. I liked them a lot. They were funny and easy-going. Now they are dead. I also appeared as a witness in a 2007 court case after two Muslim organisations in France accused Charlie Hebdo of inciting religious hatred by publishing cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed. Among them was the one by Westergaard that became the most infamous of our cartoons – a simple image of the Prophet with a bomb tucked in his turban. Yet I stumbled almost accidentally into sparking what came to be known as the cartoon crisis, leading to riots, protests and dozens of deaths around the world. Liberté: A cartoonist uses the famous 1830 Eugene Delacroix painting of the figure Liberty leading the people to revolution with the modern introduction of jihadis . I had taken a post as cultural editor of my paper after years on the road as a foreign correspondent. Among my postings was Moscow, where I was struck by dissidents who stood apart from Soviet society on the strength of their belief in freedom. The crisis began innocently enough. A children’s writer could not find an illustrator for a book about the Prophet Mohammed. Several illustrators declined to do it due to fear; then the one who agreed insisted on anonymity. We observed several more examples of self-censorship or calls for censorship when it came to the treatment of Islam in the public domain. Theatres, comedians, translators and museums were censoring themselves. My point was not to provoke or mock anyone, but simply to start a debate about self-censorship in our treatment of Islam compared with other religions. By proposing a practical demonstration – Show, Don’t Tell, a time-honoured journalistic principle – we wanted to let readers form their own opinion. As we soon found out, fears of violence for ridiculing a religious symbol were far from fantasy. I could never have imagined being condemned as a racist and finding myself on an Al Qaeda hit list. I was constantly asked to apologise for subsequent events, finding myself blamed for the lethal over-reaction of others. Following the French tragedy, I have been asked again and again my reaction. And the harsh truth is that mass murder in Paris has exposed hypocrisy, even as all those good people declare ‘Je Suis Charlie’. I find it strange that people who welcome diversity when it comes to culture, religion and ethnicity fail to welcome the same diversity when it comes to expressing ourselves. These people are basically saying that the more multicultural society becomes, the less freedom of expression we need. This seems a twisted stance. It should be the other way round – the more different we are, it seems to me, the more we need an open and free exchange of opinions. Unfortunately, governments defend restrictions on free speech on the grounds of keeping the peace and avoiding clashes between different groups. So they ban hate speech and blasphemy. In 2004, Theo van Gogh was killed in Amsterdam after making a controversial film about Islamic culture. The Dutch minister of justice responded by saying his life could have been saved if Holland had tougher laws on hate speech. The harsh truth is that the mass murder in Paris has exposed hypocrisy, even as all those good people declare ‘Je Suis Charlie’ But it is not only governments that advocate this blinkered approach. The human rights industry also defends limitations on speech, referring to the protection of human dignity and vulnerable identities. I was once asked to join a panel discussion organised by Amnesty International and the Danish Institute of Human Rights under the banner Victims of Free Speech. I suggested there were only victims of crime in a society based on the rule of law and the idea that people exerting long-held statutory rights were ‘victims’ was nonsense. There was anger at my comments. Westergaard’s cartoon of the Prophet has been criticised for being racist or stigmatising Muslims. I strongly disagree. He depicted Mohammed as representative of Islam in the same way images of Jesus refer to Christianity, Karl Marx to Marxism, and Uncle Sam to the US. Portraying Marx with blood on his hands, the crucified Christ holding a beer, or the Christian God armed with a bomb does not mean you think that all Marxists are bloodthirsty murderers or that Christians are drunkards or terrorists. Westergaard’s cartoon attacks a hardline religious doctrine, not a particular group within society. I would make a similar point about cartoons lampooning the Prophet Mohammed in Charlie Hebdo. Philippe Val, former editor-in-chief of Charlie Hebdo, was once asked if they hadn’t crossed a line with cartoons mocking the Prophet. ‘What kind of civilisation are we if we cannot ridicule those who bomb trains and airplanes and commit mass murder against innocent civilians?’ he responded. Yes indeed, what kind of civilisation are we? This is the key question for the coming days, weeks and months of hot debate. Do we want to live in a tyranny of silence – or do we defend the right to offend? These cartoons can be offensive to some; they are designed to stir debate. But labelling such images racist – an opinion aired in the US and UK – is misleading and dangerous. If you characterise race and religion as similar, you risk supporting those sinister forces who claim that apostasy is impossible and abandonment of religion a capital offence. 'These murders challenge democracies in the most sickening style. They present a terrible threat to the free speech that is the foundation of true democracy': Above, tributes to victims of the Paris terror attacks . Many Muslims believe they are born into their faith and it would be a serious crime to quit Islam. They treat religion as if it is a race. We should not accept that logic. Identity is a key issue in the modern world. It is no longer easy to answer questions such as: Who am I? Who are we as a community? How do we protect our identity? But identity politics has become a growing challenge to free speech. We seem more concerned with protecting the sensibilities of groups rather than defending the historic democratic rights that we are entitled to as human beings. The killers in Paris sincerely believed that human beings at Charlie Hebdo deserved to die because of their offensive cartoons. They felt this was justified by their militant interpretation of Islam. But the killings were also taking place within a grievance culture that incites people to take offence every time somebody says something they do not like. The assumption is that there isn’t any REAL difference between words and deeds, between a verbal insult and physical violence. Yet I believe those who support this point of view are playing into the hands of both Islamists and the growing swathe of xenophobic political parties across Europe. Instead of sending people to sensitivity training when they say something offensive, perhaps we should all be sent to insensitivity training. We need to grow thicker skins if freedom of speech is to survive in a multicultural world.","Flemming Rose is the Foreign Editor of Jyllands-Posten in Denmark .

"The owners of two dogs that mauled a six-year-old girl, biting off part of her ear have walked free from court. Ellie May Hall was savaged by the pair of snarling American Pit Bull terriers after they pounced as she played on her scooter. One of the beasts started biting her head and neck while the other sank its teeth into her torso and legs. The schoolgirl suffered multiple injuries and part of her ear was bitten off, which medics were unable to reattach. Elizabeth Mitchell, 43, and daughter Stacey Mielnik, 20, were given a suspended three month prison sentence at Newcastle Crown Court . She was also left with a hole in her arm and bite marks to her thighs, and needed a two-and-a-half hour operation, skin grafts and 11 stitches in her head. Mother and daughter, Elizabeth Mitchell, 43, and Stacey Mielnik, 20,admitted being the owners of dogs which caused injury while dangerously out of control in a public place at Newcastle Crown Court. Ellie was playing in her back yard around 3pm on May 4, when the two American Pit Bulls appeared, behind Katherine Street, Ashington, Northumberland. The girl believed the dogs were friendly when they came up to the yard and started sniffing, after smelling the scent of Ellie's dog. The previously placid dogs, then suddenly started to savage the youngster. Jason Charlton was working on his motorbike nearby and was alerted by the child's screams. 'He thought it was a dog fight then he heard a child screaming and crying,' said Prosecutor Emma Dowling. 'He opened his back gate and could see a small child on her knees facing into the rear gate. 'She had her hands on her head to protect herself and both dogs were attacking her, one towards the neck and head and the other on her torso. 'He had a crowbar in his hand and chased the dogs away but he said the dogs returned.' Ellie May Hall, pictured in hospital after attack with her mother Tina, has suffered 'significant psychological effects' Mr Charlton, helped by two other men, said he was worried for his own safety because both dogs appeared extremely vicious. In a statement to the court, he said: 'It was a horrific and terrifying incident. I'm positive if I did not come out when I did the dogs would have continued to attack Ellie. 'It was clear she had sustained substantial injuries.' The court heard both dogs were at the home of Mitchell when Mielnik arrived at the house, coming in through the back gate. Miss Dowling said: 'That gate does have bolts but they are not used by the family routinely. 'On this day they must have been left closed but not bolted or not closed properly because both dogs escaped from the rear yard into the rear lane.' The attack continues to cause Ellie and her parents ongoing problems physically and mentally. Miss Dowling said: 'She has suffered significant psychological effects and struggles to sleep. 'She is now extremely frightened of dogs and her family have had to get rid of their own dog because Ellie was petrified at what might happen. 'She struggles to visit her grandparents because they have neighbours with dogs either side so phone calls have to be made before they visit to make sure the dogs are in the house. Recorder Anton Lodge QC said he hoped the community would not continue to 'behave unpleasantly' towards the mother and daughter . 'Her parents have also been affected significantly and are worried about the effect this has had on Ellie. This has had a lasting effect on the family as a whole.' Mitchell, 43, formerly of Milburn Road, Ashington and Mielnik, 20, formerly of of Chestnut Street, Ashington, consented to the dogs being destroyed after the attack. The court heard the pair have suffered threats in their local community and have had their windows smashed and been forced to move as a result of the incident. Mark Styles, for Mitchell, said: 'She has been a dog owner for 30 years and is devastated and truly horrified at what happened to Ellie, it has turned her life upside down. 'She is a new mother and has been subjected to harassment in the local area and has been forced to move home twice and her windows have been put out.' Richard Bloomfield, for Mielnik, said: 'The dogs had given no prior indication of behaving in this way, it was an attack out of the blue. 'What she did wrong is to fail to take proper precautions to make sure the gate was secure, not realising the gravity of the consequences that afternoon when they got loose. 'She is distraught and deeply remorseful. 'She lives alone with her daughter and has suffered abuse from the local community.' Recorder Anton Lodge QC sentenced both Mitchell and Mielnik to three month suspended prison sentence. 'The community should realise the punishment for what you have done is reserved to the courts, which are publicly seen and overlooked,' said the recorder. 'I hope the community will not continue to behave in an unpleasant way towards either of you.'","Ellie May Hall, six, was mauled by the two American Pit Bull Terriers .

"Rupert Murdoch has claimed all Muslims should be held responsible for the actions of jihadists . Rupert Murdoch has sparked outrage after saying all Muslims should be held responsible for the actions of jihadists. The controversial media mogul took to Twitter after three days of terrorist atrocities in Paris. The News Corp boss suggested that even peaceful Muslims must take responsibility for the actions of terrorists until the 'jihadist cancer' is destroyed. He wrote: 'Maybe most Moslems peaceful, but until they recognize and destroy their growing jihadist cancer they must be held responsible.' He then maintained his stance, telling more than 500,000 followers that 'political correctness' made for 'denial and hypocrisy'. He added: 'Big jihadist danger looming everywhere from Philippines to Africa to Europe to US. 'Political correctness makes for denial and hypocrisy.' His words sparked a storm on the social network, with many Muslim users outraged as Murdoch appeared to lay the blame for the terrorist attacks on satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket on an entire religion, which has more than a billion followers. One user blasted his sweeping generalisation, and said: '""they"" as in most Muslims????? You can't hold an entire religion of billions responsive [sic] for the actions of a few' Erwin Renaldi said: 'I'm really sad reading this. Insulting my faith and I have nothing to do with the extremists and I can do nothing.' Simon Edhouse added: 'Rupert, is West responsible for our extremists, Anders Breivik? etc' Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling condemned Murdoch's comments, writing: 'I was born Christian. If that makes Rupert Murdoch my responsibility, I'll auto-excommunicate.' She then added: 'The Spanish Inquisition was my fault, as is all Christian fundamentalist violence. Oh, and Jim Bakker.' Bakker is a disgraced pastor and televangelist who resigned amid a sex scandal, and later served five years of an original 45-year prison sentence for fraud and conspiracy, after stealing millions from charitable donations. Others questioned Murdoch's own morals, and referred to the phone-hacking scandal at the now-defunct News of the World newspaper. Michael Monan replied: '@rupertmurdoch In the same way that you must be held responsible for ordering the hacking of the voicemails of dead school children?' Murdoch's words also prompted ridicule - with white men, journalists, Australians and men called Rupert apologising on his behalf. The creator of BBC sitcom Citizen Khan, Adil Ray, who said: 'I think all of Australia should be held responsible for Rupert Murdoch.' Matt Haig added: 'Rupert Murdoch thinks all Muslims should apologise for terrorism. So on behalf of white people I'd like to apologise for Rupert Murdoch.' Richard Robbins said: 'Am I to be held responsible for the rantings of octogenarian media moguls because we're both Caucasian?' Another user joked: 'Maybe most Ruperts peaceful, but until they recognize and destroy cancerous media dinosaur @rupertmurdoch, they must be held responsible.' To which, Rupert Franklin replied: 'I'd like to offer an apology on behalf of us all. Murdoch's comments don't represent the views of mainstream Rupert community.' And Matt Haig added: 'Rupert Murdoch wrote a tweet. As someone who uses Twitter I would like to apologise on his behalf.'","Controversial media mogul took to Twitter after Paris terror attacks .

"It was a heroic act of self- sacrifice… and it cost a brave hostage his life. Held captive inside the kosher supermarket, a Jewish hostage took what he knew would be his only chance to overpower Islamist killer Amedy Coulibaly. In an instant, he managed to grab an assault rifle that the terrorist had left on the counter at the deli in Porte de Vincennes, eastern Paris, after storming in and killing three people. But the bid for freedom turned to tragedy when the man discovered that the gun had been discarded because it was jammed. And when Coulibaly caught sight of him, he murdered him in cold blood with another weapon from his lethal arsenal. The Jewish man’s fate was revealed yesterday by another hostage in the Hyper Cacher atrocity on Friday afternoon. A woman runs from the Paris kosher grocery store in tears as she is led away by French police after officers stormed the building yesterday . A man clutches a small boy close as they flee the Hyper Cacher store where they were held hostage yesterday (left) as a woman runs from the building in tears (right) Last night there were unconfirmed reports which named the hero as 22-year-old Yohan Cohen. The witness, who gave his name as Mickael B, told how Coulibaly, 32, rounded up customers and staff and took away mobile phones before calmly explaining he was part of the Islamic State terror group. Mickael said: ‘Suddenly one of the customers tried to grab one of his guns which he’d left on the counter. It wasn’t working. ‘The terrorist had put it there because it had blocked after the first shots. He turned and shot at the customer who died on the spot.’ It is thought that the hero was the fourth person to die in the supermarket, with the first three gunned down as Coulibaly stormed in at 2pm, declaring: ‘You know who I am.’ One eyewitness said Coulibaly was smiling as he walked in, wearing a bulletproof vest over his T-shirt and jeans, and carrying a huge arsenal of deadly weapons. Many of the others present in the shop, buying kosher food and drink before the Sabbath began, tried to hide at first. Mickael’s plight was all the more desperate because he had his three-year-old son with him. The witness said: ‘I was heading for the check-out with the goods in my hand when I heard a bang – it was very loud. I thought it was a firecracker at first. Police officers protect themselves with riot shields as a fiery blast explodes at the entrance to the supermarket in Porte de Vincennes . One of the injured hostages is carried from the supermarket on a stretcher as medics quickly attempt to treat them for their injuries . ‘But turning, I saw a black man armed with two Kalashnikov rifles and I knew what was happening. ‘I grabbed my son by the collar and fled to the back of the store. There, with other customers, we ran down a spiral staircase into the basement. We all piled into one of two cold rooms. But our door wouldn’t close. We were terrified. ‘Five minutes later a store employee was sent down by the killer. She said he said we were to go back up, otherwise there’d be carnage. I refused to go up. By now my son, understanding nothing, was panicking. Then minutes later the employee comes back down with the same message. ‘This time I decided to follow her up the spiral staircase.’ At the top of the stairs Mickael saw a man lying in a pool of blood, then encountered the ‘strangely calm’ terrorist and witnessed the execution of a fellow customer. Some of the customers kept themselves hidden in the basement cold stores, spending three hours in below-freezing temperatures, yet still contacting loved ones outside. One shopper, called Noemi, managed to call a friend and told him: ‘I am very scared. I hear some noise upstairs. Make sure the police get here fast.’ Other customers were able to flee the store amid the confusion before Coulibaly brought the heavy metal shutters down on the front door. Devoted - the victim who worked in supermarket to save up for his wedding . Posing  happily with his girlfriend, this is a brave Hyper Cacher employee murdered during the Paris supermarket hostage siege. Yohan Cohen, 22, was named as one of the four Jewish victims killed by Amedy Coulibaly during the attack, possibly after grabbing a discarded gun. One of Mr Cohen’s friends revealed on Twitter that he had been working at Hyper Cacher to pay for his future wedding to girlfriend Sharon Seb. Last night, as condolences poured in from around the world, Ms Seb posted on Facebook the simple message: ‘Je suis Yohan.’ And later, in an emotional tribute to her boyfriend, she wrote: ‘What am I going to do without you? How am I going to live without you? Why you? ‘My life is ruined without you. I will never achieve anything now. I need you in my life. We had so many plans. Yohan Cohen, 22, had been working at Hyper Cacher for a year to pay for his future wedding to girlfriend Sharon Seb (right) ‘I will never forget all our time together. You will remain the man of my life for eternity. I will remain faithful to you until my dying breath. I love you with an indescribable passion.’ Earlier she had changed her Facebook profile picture, posting an image showing her hugging her boyfriend. A friend wrote in the comment field underneath: ‘An eternal love.’ Mr Cohen’s aunt, Aurelie Pluvinage, uploaded a hand-drawn sketch of her nephew to her own Facebook page. Mr Cohen, who was from Sarcelles in the northern suburbs of Paris, had only worked at the supermarket for a year. Francois Pupponi, the deputy mayor of Sarcelles, said: ‘His family are devastated. He was a very nice boy.’ Rest in peace my 'little angel': Friend's tribute to student . Tributes to Yoav Hattab, one of the supermarket victims, poured in yesterday. Avishalay Lauh, brother of Tunisian Mr Hattab, 21 – who was spending a year studying in the French capital – wrote on Facebook: ‘I am in shock. My darling brother was cowardly murdered. He did nothing wrong!’ Friend Marie Assous added: ‘May God avenge your blood and all the innocent heinously murdered in cold blood by barbarians, just because you are Jewish. Rest in peace little angel.’ Meanwhile, more details emerged about one of the other victims. Philippe Braham, who is believed to be in his 40s, was a teacher who lived with his wife Valerie and their three children in the town of L’Hay-les-Roses, about eight miles south of Paris. A neighbour described him as ‘a good man’. The final victim, Francois-Michel Saada, is believed to have been in his 60s. Both Mr Hattab (left) and Philippe Braham (right)  were murdered by Islamic terrorist Amedy Coulibaly at the kosher bakery in Paris . Lassana Bathily (pictured) put his own life at risk to protect people from Islamic fanatic Amedy Coulibaly . A Muslim employee at the supermarket at the centre of the Paris terror attacks has been hailed as a hero for saving the lives of Jewish customers. Lassana Bathily put his own life at risk to protect people from Islamic fanatic Amedy Coulibaly – by hiding them in a cold store in the basement of Hyper Cacher. Bathily came up with his quick-thinking plan when the gunman burst through the front doors on Friday. The 24-year-old shop assistant, who comes from Mali in West Africa, found six terrified customers a safe hiding place downstairs while the terrorist prowled the aisles above them. ‘When they ran down, I opened the door [to the cold store],’ Mr Bathily revealed yesterday. ‘There were several people who came to me. ‘I turned off the light, I turned off the freezer. ‘When I turned off the cold, I put them [hostages] in, I closed the door, and I told them to try to stay calm.’ The hostages had to spend three hours in the darkened room, with temperatures still below freezing, until armed police stormed the deli and Coulibaly went down in a hail of bullets. When the hostages were eventually freed, they congratulated Mr Bathily. There are now calls for him to receive an honour from the French state, after he was likened to Oskar Schindler, the German industrialist who helped about 1,200 Jews escape the Holocaust. In a further show of unity between faiths in France yesterday, senior Muslims were cheered as they added flowers to a pile of floral tributes at the site of the Hyper Cacher massacre. They were led by Hassen Chalghoumi, the imam of the city’s Drancy mosque, and they were accompanied by a local rabbi and a woman wearing a sash in the French national colours of red, white and blue. Their gesture of solidarity as they arrived was met with cries of ‘Bravo’ from the watching crowd. Mr Chalghoumi made a similar tribute on Thursday at the site of the attack on satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. On that occasion he described the terrorists responsible for the atrocity as ‘criminals’ and ‘barbarians’ who had nothing to do with Islam. As the group left yesterday, the crowd, which included Jews, Muslims and Christians, began to chant ‘tous ensemble’, meaning ‘everyone together’.","Hostages Yohan Cohen, 22, Yoav Hattab, 21, Philippe Braham and Francois-Michel Saada were all killed by jihadi .

"His slick black hair and boyish looks sent female fans around the world into a frenzy. So as music lovers around the world celebrated what would have been Elvis Presley's 80th birthday this week - an image was released showing what he may have looked like now. Photo specialists Phojoe.com created an age progression photo of the King of Rock and Roll - with graying hair and wrinkles. King of Rock and Roll: Image specialists Phojoe.com studied 50 photos of Elvis Presley to put together a picture of what he would have looked like on his 80th birthday last Thursday . The company is regularly used by local law enforcement, media, and occasionally the FBI to put together images of how suspects or people of interest may look years down the line. They studied about 50 photos of Elvis and used them as reference to come up with the image predicting how the rock and roll icon would look now. Presley was born in poverty in Tupelo, Mississippi on January 8, 1935, and as a teen moved to Memphis with his parents and absorbed the mixture of blues, rhythm and blues, and African-American gospel from which rock music emerged. He moved to Memphis with his parents at age 13. He died on August 16, 1977 in Memphis at the age of 42. Several hundred fans braved freezing cold on Thursday to join Elvis Presley's family in Memphis, Tennessee on what would have been the King of Rock 'n' Roll's 80th birthday. Cheers went up as Presley's former wife Priscilla and their only child Lisa Marie, along with Elvis' grandchildren, sliced an eight-tier cake frozen by the 16F temperature, then sang happy birthday to the king. Appearance: The singer sent female fans around the world into a frenzy during his illustrious career with slick, black hair and boyish looks . Fans got a chance to get a bite of the cake at a diner across the street from Graceland, the Presley residence that has become a shrine to his life, work and rich musical legacy. In a ceremony held at Graceland this morning, January 8 was declared to be Elvis Presley Day in Memphis, Tennessee. An American pop culture icon like few others, Presley rode high in the rock music charts in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s before his untimely death. His legacy includes 108 songs on Billboard magazine's Hot 100 pop music chart as well as 129 records in the Billboard 200 album chart - most recently in 2002 with a greatest hits set. 'He has stayed on top all these years,' said Scotty Moore, 83, of Nashville, the guitarist and last man standing from the recording session that yielded the 1954 hit That's All Right. Other birthday events on Thursday include an auction of authenticated Elvis memorabilia including his first driver's license and the jacket he wore in the movie 'Viva Las Vegas.' Also up for grabs is the first recording Presley ever made - an acetate disc from Sun Studios on which he sang the 1940s chestnut 'My Happiness' for his mother. He was 18 at the time.

"'To hell and back': Virginia Roberts has turned her life around... but fears reprisals after going public . The woman at the centre of the Prince Andrew under-age sex scandal was forced to flee her home and ‘fears for her life’, her aunt claimed last night. Virginia Roberts, 31, sparked headlines around the globe when she filed sensational court papers claiming she slept with the Prince three times, including as a juvenile of 17 under Florida law, while working as a teen ‘sex slave’ for convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Last night Virginia’s aunt Carol Roberts Kess, a devout Mormon who helped raise her, spoke for the first time to tell how terrified Virginia fled her Florida home several months ago amid fears of reprisals from billionaire Epstein and his rich and powerful friends. ‘She knew these court papers were coming out so she packed up and fled,’ Carol said. ‘She is frightened for her life. She has angered a lot of powerful and very rich people. Who knows what they could do?’ Carol, the sister of Virginia’s father Sky, said her niece is now living in a ranch ‘in the middle of nowhere’ in Colorado with her husband and three young children. ‘She doesn’t feel safe,’ retired teacher Carol added. ‘There are too many powerful people involved and she is saying things they don’t want made public. ‘Virginia was living a happy life in Florida but she packed up and left because she knew this was coming and was scared for her own life and that of her family. ‘Just before she left she told me she wouldn’t be able to contact any family members for a while – for our own safety. She said, “It’s for the best. I don’t want to put anyone in danger.”’ Carol says she has ‘no reason not to believe’ her niece’s claims she slept with Prince Andrew three times, in New York, London and the Virgin Islands– accusations the Prince vehemently denies. And asked about claims that Virginia, who is writing a book of her story, was a fantasist out to profit from the scandal, Carol said: ‘Virginia is not a fantasist, I don’t believe this is about the money.’ Despite the headlines, little is known about the woman at the heart of the scandal. The Mail on Sunday has spoken to members of Virginia’s family and close friends and has unearthed court papers which reveal a heartbreaking tale of a ‘good Christian girl’ whose life spiralled out of control after she was repeatedly sexually assaulted by older men at a young age. It is a cautionary saga, according to her aunt, ‘of how things can go real bad, real quickly’. ‘My niece went to hell and back,’ she said. Virginia was born in 1983 to Sky Roberts, an odd-job man and ‘horse-loving cowboy’, and Lynn, a bank worker who already had a two-year-old son Daniel from a previous marriage. The family lived in Sacramento, California but moved to Loxahatchee in Palm Beach County, Florida, when Virginia was just four years old. Another aunt, Kimberley Roberts, said yesterday: ‘The family wasn’t wealthy but Lynn came from money and Virginia was given a trust fund by her maternal grandmother. 'Lynn’s mother took the family on lavish holidays when Virginia was a child. She was brought up with good morals; respect your parents, don’t talk back, don’t drink or do drugs.’ But while Virginia’s early years on her father’s small ranch were ‘idyllic’ according to aunt Carol, everything changed when she was 12 and was molested by a family friend: ‘He said he needed to send Virginia to live with me. Of course I said yes immediately.' Carol, who was then living in Monterey, California, added: ‘I’m a Mormon. I don’t drink, smoke or drink caffeine. Virginia needed stability. 'She was very quiet and had an eating disorder. She’d have a piece of lettuce and say she’d eaten. If your world feels out of control the one part of your life you can control is what you eat.’ Virginia returned to live with her parents after a year when the molester, a neighbour, moved out of the area. But when she returned to Florida, Virginia, then 13, went off the rails. Family ties: A snap of Virginia Roberts, left, with her aunt Carol Kess. Carol says she has ‘no reason not to believe’ her niece’s claims she slept with Andrew three times - accusations the Prince vehemently denies . In an interview with The Mail on Sunday in 2011, Virginia said the fallout from the molestation caused her parents to temporarily split. She admitted living on the streets where she was ‘beaten up’ and slept with at least two older men in return for food: ‘I was a paedophile’s dream,’ she said. The Mail on Sunday has now seen court papers showing transcript of a telephone conversation with lawyer in which Virginia said: ‘A close family friend has sexually abused me and I was on the streets at 13. 'I was picked up by a 67-year-old man who did exactly what Jeffrey did with me, abuse and violate my youthfulness and I was with him for six months.’ The Mail on Sunday has chosen not to name the man who, we believe, is now dead. Carol said she didn’t know what happened, adding: ‘I am not saying that doesn’t make it true. I believe what Virginia says.’ Other friends from that time say Virginia sank into drug addiction. One said: ‘She smoked weed and didn’t spend a lot of time at school. Her elder brother Daniel took her to rehab aged just 15 or 16. Virginia was definitely troubled, but she wouldn’t speak about her demons with anyone – she just kept it bottled up.’ 'Thrilled': Carol said Virginia's family was excited when she showed them this 2001 photograph of Prince Andrew with his arm around her . At 15, Virginia’s world changed when she met Ghislaine Maxwell, the-then girlfriend of billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. Virginia’s father was a maintenance man at Mar A Largo, Donald Trump’s luxury hotel in Palm Beach, Florida; his daughter folded towels at the pool. Ghislaine, Virginia has said in court papers, recruited her into Epstein’s harem of young ‘masseuses’ whose primary job was to satisfy the financier’s twisted sexual fantasies. However Ghislaine, the daughter of press baron Robert Maxwell, has branded such claims against her as ‘untrue’ and ‘obvious lies’. An old friend of Virginia’s recalled: ‘We had our doubts about why exactly Jeffrey had picked this young girl to be his favourite masseuse, when she didn’t know much about it, especially when he started flying her around the world. But she didn’t say anything about the abuse until much later. ‘Once she’d told her boyfriend at the time the truth they then decided she shouldn’t work there any longer. But Epstein wanted her there and was used to getting his way. He lured her back and told her she wouldn’t have to do so much of the sexual stuff if she could bring in other girls from school.’ This had been Epstein’s modus operandi for years: encouraging girls to bring in more girls to feed his perverted desires. It was described by one lawyer as a ‘pyramid of sexual abuse’. Virginia’s family say they were ‘stunned’ when they learned she had been passed around as a sex toy. Aunt Carol said: ‘How she got seduced into Epstein’s world I don’t know. I can’t get inside Virginia’s head to know what made her vulnerable to Epstein. 'They were really good at what they did and they were able to accomplish what they accomplished. ‘My brother thought it was all very legitimate. When Virginia told us she’d met Prince Andrew we were thrilled. Virginia gave my Mum a copy of the picture of Andrew with his arm around her – the picture which has now been seen around the world. At the time my reaction was “Wow, how neat!” I couldn’t believe Virginia had met Prince Andrew. I was ecstatic. ‘All I would say now is that anyone – anyone – who abuses young people deserves to be prosecuted.’ While still in Epstein’s orbit, Virginia was also working at the Roadhouse Grill, a burger bar in Palm Beach, when she was accused of stealing just over £200 from her employer. However, Carol said: ‘I never even knew she worked in a burger place.’ Very soon afterwards, at the age of 19, Virginia went to Thailand to take a massage course and fell in love with Australian martial arts expert Robbie Giuffre. They wed within ten days of meeting. Aunt Carol says: ‘She met Robbie and turned her life around. ‘It breaks my heart that I haven’t been able to speak to her since this blew up but it’s her choice. ‘She knows what she is up against, we don’t. I fear for her, but I also admire her. She’s a strong girl and she will get through this.’ Additional reporting: Peter Sheridan .

"The brother of police officer Ahmed Merabet (pictured) who was executed in the street by the Charlie Hebdo gunmen described them as 'madmen' The family of a Muslim police officer shot dead by the Charlie Hebdo killers has described them as 'madmen' with 'no religion'. Malik Merabet said the death of Ahmed Merabet, 42,  was a 'waste' and pleaded for unity, saying Islam must not be conflated with extremism. Mr Merabet was the last of the 12 victims slain in the terror attack on French satirical newspaper. A police officer, he was the son of immigrants from mainly Muslim North Africa and was shot dead on the sidewalk by one of the assailants as they started their getaway. Video footage taken by an onlooker that surfaced on the Internet after the attack appeared to show a wounded Mr Merabet on the pavement, raising a hand as though appealing for mercy before he was fatally shot in the head by one of the three gunmen. The massacre was condemned around the world as an assault on freedom of speech. The magazine, which mocks politicians and religions alike, was firebombed in 2011 after carrying a caricature of the Prophet Mohammed. During an emotional news conference Mr Merabet's brother broke down when asked about graphic images of the police officer lying injured on a pavement and apparently raising his arms in defence before one of the gunmen shot him dead at close range. Mr Merabet said his brother was 'very proud' to represent the police and 'defend the values' of the French Republic. He said: 'Thanks to his determination, he became a judicial police officer. Companions described him as someone who loved his job. Scroll down for video . People lay flowers and candles outside the offices of Charlie Hebdo in Paris today in memory of the victims . 'He was committed. He looked after his mother and his close family. He was a pillar of the family. He was a very protective father, a lovely brother, a loving companion.' He said the family was 'devastated by this barbaric act', adding: 'We are devastated for all the victims.' He went on: 'I am addressing myself to all racists - the Islamophobes and the anti-Semites: You must not mix up extremism with Muslims. 'The madmen have no colour nor religion. Stop ... having wars or burning mosques or burning synagogues because you are attacking people. This woman's sign says 'Stop killing in our name. Terrorism has no religion. #JeSuisAhmed . A campaign of support for the satirical newspaper spread after the attack, using the slogan 'Je Suis Charlie' 'My brother was Muslim and he was killed by two terrorists, by two false Muslims. 'Islam is a religion of peace and love. As far as my brother's death is concerned it was a waste.' Of the killers - brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi - he said: 'I am glad they were stopped.' As details of Mr Merabet's death became known, a campaign of solidarity quickly caught fire on social media on Thursday, using the phrase 'Je Suis Ahmed' - I Am Ahmed. It echoed the campaign of support for the satirical newspaper that spread after the attack, using the slogan 'Je Suis Charlie.' Mr Merabet, originally from Livry-Gargan in north eastern Paris, had been a fully-trained police officer for eight years. His death also drew the attention at the United Nations. 'He himself was a Muslim,' U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told reporters. 'This is yet another reminder of what we are facing together. It should never be seen as a war of religion, for religion, or on religion. It is an assault on our common humanity, designed to terrify and incite.' Tributes for Mr Merabet have continued to pour in, with one person writing: 'RIP Ahmed Merabet, French policeman, murdered protecting people in Paris', while Alan Mendoza said: 'Important to note that amid the carnage today a brave Muslim policeman was murdered by those claiming to represent Islam.' The second police officer to be killed in the attack was Franck Brinsolaro, 49, a brigadier and protection officer for the magazine's editor Stephane Charbonnier.

ISIS claims to be against the use and cultivation of drugs such as cannabis and heroin, unlike the Taliban in Afghanistan who 'tax' farmers to be allowed to grow the lucrative crop. A report issued late last year by the United Nations found that more than half-a-million acres of land is being used to grow opium. It is believed that 6,400 tonnes of opium was produced in 2014, slightly down on the record 7,400 tonnes in 2007. The survey claimed: 'In 2014, opium prices decreased in all regions of Afghanistan. One probable reason for the decrease was an increase in supply due to an increase in production.' Several boxes full of drugs were also tossed onto the pile, including one with the name 'Brilliant' Despite the intoxicating fumes, the terrorist continues to pile the drugs on top of the burning mound .

"Injured Australian cricket captain Michael Clarke has been named in the 15-man squad for the World Cup and is confident he will be fit for the one-day tournament. Clarke, who missed the final three Tests against India due to hamstring surgery, has been given until February 21 to prove his fitness for the one-day tournament. Chief selector Rod March revealed he will replace Clarke if the 33-year-old is not ready for to go for the side's clash with Bangladesh in Brisbane. 'We have said that if Michael has not recovered by our second match of the tournament against Bangladesh ... we will replace him in the squad,' Marsh said. Scroll down for video . Michael Clarke (right with chief selector Rod Marsh left) has been named in Australia's World Cup squad . 'He understands that and is working tirelessly with medical staff to get back to fitness.' Speaking at the squad announcement in Sydney on Sunday Clarke was positive he could make the deadline. 'I'll do the work. It won't be lack of work that doesn't get me there. 'I'm confident I'll be fit,' he said. Marsh revealed any player not fully fit by February 21 will be omitted from the squad, with the chief selector wanting everything settled early in the group stage. Marsh added it would be up to the team's medical staff to pass Clarke fit, but that he wanted the skipper bowling, fielding and running between the wickets. This is providing he is fit enough following a hamstring injury which has seen him off the field in past weeks . Clarke, along with his teammates will have to pass a fitness test on February 21 to ensure his position in the squad . 'He knows what he's go to do, he's played enough cricket to know whether he's right to go,' Marsh said. 'We looked at the best batsmen in the country and Michael's certainly one of them.' Clarke suggested he wasn't thinking about the deadline, saying: 'I'm focusing on my rehab.' When asked if he was happy with the early cut-off date which falls nearly a month before the quarter-finals begin, the 33-year-old replied 'it's up to the selectors, they make the decision'. Mitch Marsh, who missed recent Tests at the MCG and SCG due to a hamstring strain, was also named in a squad that contained few surprises. George Bailey remains vice-captain of the one-day side and will lead Australia if Clarke fails to play in the tournament. The captain, seen here at the first Test on December 12, missed the final three Tests against India due to hamstring surgery . 'George has done a fantastic job with the team ... he's an experienced campaigner,' Marsh said. 'I think he (Steve Smith) is pretty tired after captaining the Test side and will relish the fact he can just go out there and play cricket.' Allrounders Marsh, Shane Watson and James Faulkner were all automatic selections, while Glenn Maxwell is likely to be given a chance to shine in Australia's XI. Xavier Doherty was picked as the sole tweaker, with Maxwell expected to provide the side's spin in most games. Mitchell Johnson, Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood will make up Australia's pace attack.

"At first sight, this could be one of the hooded, black-clad terrorists involved in the Paris shootings. In reality, it is a male model on a London catwalk yesterday, promoting military-influenced ‘utility-chic’ designer wear. With highly dubious timing, fashion label Maharishi continued with its show as world leaders prepared to join a million-strong march in Paris today to remember those killed in the outrage. Scroll down for video . A male model wears Maharishi's A/W 2015 collection at a catwalk show in London today in a look that resembles outfits worn by black-clad terrorists. Right, he carries an umbrella that mimics a weapon . One model wears a black jacket with a hood that resembles a balaclava, with the mouth covered and just the eyes exposed and carries an ominous-looking umbrella on his back. Former Home Office Minister Norman Baker said: ‘The timing of this does look a little unfortunate.’ The designer, which was established in 1994 by Hardy Blechman, has been specialising in military fashion since its outset. It made a comeback on the runway for today's show where the autumn/winter 2015 collection featured nineties trademark camo print and combat trousers. Blechman previously worked in the international military and industrial clothing surplus trade and began producing hemp and other natural fibre clothing as well as recycling workwear. It comes as millions of people prepare to march in Paris today to remember those who were killed in the Charlie Hebdo massacre and hostages at the Jewish kosher supermarket.

"The BBC should be forced to put more women on screen as a condition of its licence fee funding being renewed, a powerful Parliamentary committee will say this week. The Lord’s Communications Committee will recommend that more women should present news programmes and appear on panel shows and discussions, to cut down on the number of ‘men in suits’ who dominate factual television. The committee, which has been investigating the role of women in news and current affairs broadcasting after a raft of ageism and sexism allegations, is due to publish its conclusions on Thursday. Tribunal victory: Former BBC presenter Miriam O'Reilly won an ageism claim against the BBC four years ago . One well-placed source said ‘the BBC has a lot to answer for’, and revealed that the report would criticise the Corporation for imposing confidentiality clauses on employees whose contracts are terminated. It will acknowledge that the committee cannot legislate on the issue, but will suggest resolving the matter when the BBC’s Royal Charter is renewed, along with its funding agreement, it is understood. The charter, which determines the Corporation’s scope and remit, and its funding, are both ten-year agreements which are due to come up for renewal at the end of 2016. The committee may also suggest looking at the introduction of quotas for women in presenting positions – and is expected to criticise broadcasters over the way men dominate expert panels. Channel 4 News presenter Cathy Newman said it was a ‘scandal that there are not more women in the industry over 50’ A source said: ‘Again, there’s too many suits – too many male experts invited on and not enough women.’ Last night Miriam O’Reilly, an award-winning journalist who four years ago won an ageism claim against the BBC, said she would be ‘delighted’ to see more women on screen – but pointed out that the BBC still had lots to do. ‘The BBC said it would reach out to older women but have not grasped any hands yet,’ she said, adding: ‘I still feel that some executives mistake youth and good looks as talent.’ Kay Burley, above, is the longest-serving female newsreader on British television . Last November former Countryfile presenter Miss O’Reilly was one of a number of women who provided explosive evidence to Parliament. She told the committee she was ‘blacklisted’ by BBC management after her 2011 tribunal, a claim the corporation denies. Peers were also provided with statements from six of her former BBC female colleagues, as well as anonymous accounts from other women in the industry, who claimed they had been mistreated because of their age. One said older female journalists were ‘likened to a nanny, a schoolmistress or a strident old battleaxe’, while their male colleagues were allowed to be ‘ugly, grizzly, fat, old and peculiar’. And Channel 4 News presenter Cathy Newman said it was a ‘scandal that there are not more women in the industry over 50’. The report is understood to single out the BBC’s performance because of the state broadcaster’s size, but the recommendations could also apply to other broadcasters. A BBC spokeswoman said it had eliminated gagging clauses, and went on to say: ‘Nearly half of the BBC’s news and current affairs workforce is female. We have a large number of on-air and management positions filled by women. We’re addressing the imbalance on air and off air.’ A Sky News spokeswoman said: ‘Sky has 23 presenters, 14 are female. Kay Burley is the longest-serving female newsreader on British television.’ Channel 5 said it does not have quotas for women. Channel 4 did not respond to requests for comment.","Lords committee has been investigating role of women in broadcasting .

"Meditating really is a workout for the mind, according to scientists who have found it can make the brain bigger. Practising simple meditation techniques such as concentrating on your breathing helps build denser grey matter in parts of the brain associated with learning and memory, controlling emotions and compassion. Just eight weeks of meditation can produce structural changes large enough to be picked up by MRI scanners, American scientists have discovered. Practising simple meditation techniques such as concentrating on your breathing helps build denser grey matter in parts of the brain associated with learning and memory (stock image) Harvard neuroscientist Dr Sara Lazar said: ‘If you use a particular part of your brain, it’s going to grow because you are using it. It really is mental exercise. Basically, the idea is “use it or lose it”. It’s like building a muscle.’ In a study run by Dr Lazar and her colleagues, 16 volunteers had their brains scanned before and after an eight-week ‘mindfulness’ course. Mindfulness is an increasingly popular form of meditation where the aim is to focus thoughts on the body’s physical sensations and detach yourself from the ‘chatter of the mind’. The volunteers had weekly group sessions in which they did breathing exercises, gentle yoga and a ‘body scan’, focusing their thoughts on one part of the body at a time. They were also asked to practise for about half an hour each day. MRI scans were taken before and after the sessions and compared with volunteers who had not taken part in the meditation course. In a study, 16 volunteers had their brains scanned before and after an eight-week ‘mindfulness’ course . After eight weeks, those who went on the course had thicker grey matter in several parts of the brain. These included the left hippocampus, a small horseshoe-shaped structure in the central brain involved in memory, learning and emotional regulation. Other parts ‘strengthened’ were the posterior cingulate cortex – again important for memory and emotions; the temporo-parietal junction, involved in empathising; and the cerebellum, which helps coordinate movement. Those who did not go on the course experienced no such structural brain changes. Dr Lazar said mental exercise stimulated the neurons that make up grey matter to form denser connections among themselves.","Practising meditation helps build denser grey matter in parts of the brain associated with learning and memory, controlling emotions and compassion .

"While cars have come on leaps and bounds in the last few decades, one serious problem remains: most still have a significant blind spot where the pillars of the car are. But now a new concept might finally have solved that problem, using cameras to make the pillars 'transparent' when the driver looks towards them and give them 360 degree vision. The car also has a 'smart' windscreen that displays hazards and projects a 'ghost car' to help the driver find their way through traffic. Scroll down for video . UK-based Jaguar Land Rover have unveiled a smart concept car. It uses cameras to make certain parts of the car 'transparent' (shown). When a driver looks to the side, for example, the pillar between the driver and passenger door becomes see-through. This enables the driver to see obstacles or cars outside the vehicle . The technology is employed in a concept car from British engineers at Jaguar Land Rover. It has cameras fitted to the outside frame of the car to provide a live feed onto screens on the pillars inside the car. This essentially makes them see-through, with the feed kicking in the moment the driver indicates, moves their head over their shoulder or approaches a junction. Driving in thick fog can be rather unnerving, with it being difficult to see other cars in the low visibility conditions. But a new heads-up-display (HUD) for cars could alleviate these concerns by showing the position of other cars on the windscreen. The fighter-jet-style display can alert drivers to other cars in dense fog and other extreme weather conditions - and this could help avoid a collision. The display is being developed at Glasgow Caledonian University (GCU). It is hoped the technology, which is still in concept form, could reduce the potential for accidents. Dr Wolfgang Epple, Director of Research and Technology at UK-based Jaguar Land Rover, said: 'Our ultimate aim is to reduce road accidents and enhance the urban driving experience. 'The Jaguar Land Rover research team is developing this technology to improve visibility and to give the driver with the right information at the right time. 'If we can keep the driver's eyes on the road ahead and present information in a non-distracting way, we can help drivers make better decisions in the most demanding and congested driving environments.' Crashing into cyclists and pedestrians could become a thing of the past after engineers with these transparent pillars, designed to give drivers 360 degree vision. Jaguar Land Rover fitted cameras to the outside frame of a concept car to provide a live feed onto screens on the other side. This essentially makes them see-through . The invention is part of Jaguar Land Rover's '360 Virtual Urban Windscreen' research, which also hopes to improve a driver's navigation. Engineers are also developing the 'Follow-Me Ghost Car Navigation', which projects an image of a vehicle in front of the driver's car for them to follow, turn by turn, to their destination. The connected car could also enhance navigation by advising the driver to turn left or right at more visible landmarks, such as pubs or shops, rather than just road signs or street names. Dr Epple added: 'Driving on city streets can be a stressful experience, but imagine being able to drive across town without having to look at road signs, or be distracted trying to locate a parking space as you drive by. 'We want to present all of this information on a Heads-Up Display in the driver's eye-line, so the driver doesn't have to seek it out for themselves and take their eyes off the road ahead.'","UK-based Jaguar Land Rover have unveiled a smart concept car .

'After seeking advice from the Swan Sanctuaries veterinary team we decided to send the swan up to their specialist for assessment. 'But we hope the swan will be suitable for returning to the area once fit and well.' Wildlife rescue volunteer Chris Riddington added: 'I've never seen anything quite like it. 'The swan was completely red. There were no white feathers at all, just blood everywhere.' Volunteer rescuer Trevor Weeks swam across three dykes in order to catch the stricken swan . Rescuers believe that the bird may have come into contact with a power line during a crash landing. The cuts were centred around the swan's mouth and the blood was believed to have been spread as it preened itself.","Blood soaked bird found by volunteers in field in Wartling, East Sussex .

"Jaw-dropping footage has emerged of a Russian man dangling one-handed off a crane hundreds of feet in the air. The footage, captured in Engels, near the city of Saratov, shows fearless Alexander Rusinov dangling perilously from the edge of building crane. The 20-year-old has found fame in Russia due to his def-defying stunts that involve hanging without any safety wires from monuments, buildings and cranes at perilous heights. The 20-year-old still has time to interact with the cameraman, but better make sure he doesn't lose his focus . Rusinov dangles from the crane in Engels, and what's added to the risk is that the wind is picking up . The daredevil knows no bounds when it comes to personal safety. But before he tries a stunt, he always thinks twice before doing anything. He also says his tricks are thoroughly prepared.'I really like what I do,' he adds. He says he is only afraid of hurting himself — not of plunging to the ground below him. The height of the crane is all too apparent in this shot, yet Rusinov is confident to carry on . Not content with pull-ups, Rusinov displays some more of his strength at the heart-stopping height . The teenager started practicising parkour after watching films of other daredevils on the internet and started training in a playground and in the school gym just a year ago. Since then he decided to up his game and take advantage of some of his hometown Saratov's impressive architecture and began doing handstands on bridges over the Volga River jumping between rooftops and scaling walls. Rusinov has been practicing his skills for many years after watching videos of other daredevils online . Alexander Rusinov and his equally as daring friends at the top of the crane in Russia . He has since amassed an army of fans after posting his videos on YouTube. Known as the Saratov Spiderman, he has said in the past that instead of fearing death, he prefers to imagine that he is safely on the ground while performing stunts. Naturally, his worried family disapprove of his rather dangerous hobby.","Alexander Rusinov dangles perilously from the edge of building crane .

"Aleem Iqbal, 19, from Solihull, West Midlands, has had a fleet of cars . worth more than £500,000 torched in two arson attacks in just five days . A millionaire teenager has had four supercars worth more than £500,000 torched by arsonists in what he claims are a 'vile act of jealousy'. Aleem Iqbal, 19, from Solihull, West Midlands, who goes by the name 'Lord Aleem' on the internet, had his flash Lamborghini set alight last Friday - just five days before three more of his super cars were destroyed by vandals. The teenager, whose runs a luxury car hire business in Yardley with his father, said the culprits would be going down 'for a long time' - and he would 'sit back and enjoy the show' once they did. But the wealthy car fanatic - who has a number plate on one of his cars reading 1 ORD for 'Lord' - admitted the loss was not of a scale that he would 'lose any sleep over it'. He told MailOnline: 'I run a successful business and these people are just trying to ruin that. 'I have not done anything to deserve this. I work hard and I give back to the community. People say I show off but I don't. 'If I wanted to show off, I could say 'I am the ones with all the car, who are you, you peasants', but I don't say that. 'It is not a loss on a scale where I am losing my sleep over it. But it's just cowardly and I hope these people are found.' Mr Iqbal's father Saleem originally set up Platinum Executive Travel, which offers Rolls-Royce, . Lamborghini, Ferrari and Bentley models for hire, in Birmingham. Now the teenager - who says his family runs by the motto that 'what's my father's is mine' - also helps runs the business. He has more than 160,000 followers on the photo-sharing app Instagram, where he dazzles his fans with pictures of his latest cars, and proclaims that he is 'not your average 19-year-old lad'. He also posts photos of himself with his luxury cars on Twitter, where his profile reads 'Let Your . Lamborghini Make The Noise'. But he says this prolific online presence - which he believes might have been a motive behind the attacks - is often taken in the wrong way. He said: 'I post those things because I want people to be motivated by my success. If they are motivated to succeed and say I was their motivation, then I have won. 'Even things like the name 'Lord' - it was just a stage name. People might not like it but I can call myself what I want. I won't let people call me that in person. 'I have done nothing to upset people. The worst thing I have done is post some photos of some Lamborghinis but that's not me being flash - they are just flash cars. Scroll down for video . The wealthy teenager, who Twitter profile reads 'Let Your Lamborghini . Make The Noise' - runs a luxury car hire business with his father and believes the attacks have been carried out in a 'vile act of jealousy' The 19-year-old, who has more than 163,000 followers on the photo-sharing app . Instagram, said he would 'sit back and enjoy the show' once the . arsonists were caught . 'Lots of people buy themselves a Lord title . for £20 these days and noone comments. I didn't buy one because why would I spend . £20 buying a title when I have a number plate worth thousands with the . name on it.' The car fanatic calls him 'Lord Aleem' online but says he does not let people call him that in person . The . first arson attack took place after Mr Iqbal hired out a new £340,000 . Lamborghini Aventador Roadster for a wedding on Friday last week. But hours later, the car was set alight outside a house in Luton, Bedfordshire, by three hooded men. The group was captured on CCTV driving to the site in a Mercedes 4 X 4 before dousing the car in petrol. Five . days later, three more of his luxury cars, worth around £200,000, were . destroyed in a second attack close to the family business, which was . also captured on CCTV. Two Audi R8 Spyder supercars and a . Bentley Flying Spur were parked in a hotel car park, near to where the . company is building a new showroom, when the arson attack took place. Speaking after the first attack, he said: 'I’m not really in a great state of mind at the moment - I’ve had half a million pounds worth of cars destroyed in the last few days. 'I’m not sure if its an attack on my family because they would have come directly after me or my family if that was the case. 'However, . I do believe it could be a vile act of jealousy towards my business or . it could just be mindless vandals on an arson spree. 'Either way, one thing is for sure they . will be caught and when they do I suggest you sit back and enjoy the . show because they will be going down for a long time. Mr Iqbal, who says he is passionate about cars, had hired out the car for a wedding when it was attacked by arsonists . This CCTV shows the moment that one of the supercars which the teenager had leased out from the family firm was doused in . petrol and set alight by vandals . The £340,000 Lamborghini was damaged but Mr Iqbal says he hopes to get it back on the road in the next four weeks . He later told MailOnline: 'Some people will work hard their entire lives and will never be able to have a super car - they might not even be able to get a car - and that's not their fault. 'But it does not mean you can go around doing things like this. It is awful.' Platinum Executive Travel's website offers chauffeur-driven car hire for weddings and corporate events and claims it was the first in the West Midlands to offer the Phantom for hire, with rates starting at £600 a day. The company was initially set up by Mr Iqbal's father but he has now joined him in running the family business. After the first attack in Luton, Mr Iqbal . said: 'Fortunately the driver was in the house at the time but this . could have endangered lives, there could have been dead bodies. Five days later, three more supercars were targetted in an arson . attack. The vehicles were taken away from the site of the Holiday Inn . Express hotel car park, where they had been parked . West Midlands police said an investigation was under way following the incident, which took place near to the site of the car hire showroom in Yardley . 'These arsonists really don’t know what they could have caused. When I was told about what happened I felt the ground beneath me move. 'It has taken a lot of hard work and effort to get where we are and we cannot take a loss of £340,000. 'I thought it would be toast but the passenger seat and dashboard is damaged so hopefully we should be able to get it back onto the road within four weeks. The teenager said it had taken a lot of hard work and effort to build up the business and his family was being punished for their hard work . Mr Iqbal is prolific on social netowrking sites on the internet and dazzles his fans with pictures of flash cars . Saleem Iqbal, the teenager's father, set up Platinum Executive Travel, . based in Yardley, which offers Rolls-Royce, Lamborghini, Ferrari and . Bentley cars for hire . 'At the time there were a number of valuable cars outside but it seems they went for the Lamborghini as it was most expensive.' West Midlands Police said: 'An investigation is underway into a suspected arson attack at the Holiday Inn Express Car Park on Coventry Road. 'The three vehicles were well alight when officers arrived and are estimated to be worth more than £200,000. 'Officers have recovered CCTV that shows two offenders setting the vehicles alight at around 12.20am. 'We would urge anyone who saw anybody acting suspiciously late on Wednesday or in the early hours of Thursday morning to contact the investigation team in Stechford.'

"A Senate candidate in Iowa has used the tragic murder of his sister as a justification for the right to bear arms in a campaign video, during which he threatens to use both his gun and a knife. Bob Quast is running as an Independent in the race and introduces himself as a father, a term-limits advocate, and a brother looking for revenge. ‘If you are the sexual predator and sociopath who murdered my sister Lynette and you come to my front door to do harm to my girls, I'm going to use my Glock to blow your balls off,’ he says while smiling into the camera. Glimmer: A graphic shows Bob Quast's shining tooth immediately after he threatens to castrate his brother-in-law, who was convicted of killing Quast's sister in 1999 . The ‘sociopath’ in question is his former brother-in-law Thomas Craft who pled guilty to killing his wife Lynette, Quast’s sister, in 1999. Making himself clear: Quast is a strong supporter of the Second Amendment . The couple lived in Ohio but pieces of Lynette’s body were found at various points around Ann Arbor, Michigan- including a part of a leg at a McDonald’s and other body parts in a trash can in a different part of town. Business Insider reports that Craft was released from prison in 2011 as a result of a plea deal and is living at a halfway house in Ohio. Quast mentions his sister’s murder only 20 seconds into the minute-long video, and moves on quickly to talk about how presumed Democratic candidate Congressman Bruce Braley  and other ‘liberals… want to restrict our gun rights’. This is the second shocking ad to come . out of the race to fill the open seat in Iowa, as Republican candidate . Joni Ernst previously released a video where she touts her years . castrating pigs on an Iowa farm, saying that ‘when I get to Washington, . I’ll know how to cut pork’. Quast . makes a reference to Ersnt’s ad in an effort to differentiate himself . as the Independent in the race, whipping out a gun and playing a quick . clip of a squealing pig that was used in Ernst’s ad as part of his own. Speaking . directly to camera, he calls for an open debate before the primary and . tells Braley ‘you have nothing to fear as we are friendly folks here in . Iowa,’ holding up his Glock in one hand and a knife in another. Laughing matter? Quast jokes that Iowans are 'a friendly people' while holding up his Glock and a knife . Family man: Quast is running as an Independent candidate for the open Iowa senate seat . ‘I will leave my gun at home. Joni can leave her knife on the farm, as long as you agree to leave your elite law degree in D.C.,’ he says. ‘We’ll just use our brains to debate your reckless laws and taxes like Braley-care, including common sense solutions to clean up your messes.’ Quast, a former Army contractor, signs out by touting the fact that he never went to law school. ‘My new video truly addresses issues in Iowa while retaining a sense of humor,’ Quast later told The Des Moines Register.","Former Army contractor Bob Quast is running as an Independent .

"David De Gea could face at least a month out of action after dislocating a finger during training with the Spanish national side. The Manchester United goalkeeper was having the injury assessed by Spain's team doctor on Friday night before deciding when he should return to Old Trafford. The 24-year-old who has been in brilliant form for United this season was trying to save a low shot from Paco Alcacer when the little finger on his right hand jammed during a session preparing for Saturday's friendly against Belarus in Huelva. David de Gea is attended to in Spain training after injuring his finger during a training session on Friday . De Gea walks off the pitch in Huelva on Friday after injuring himself during the session . He was immediately led away, and United confirmed that the Spanish FA had told them the injury was a dislocation. It is another injury worry for Spain, who are already without Chelsea midfield Cesc Fabregas because of a hamstring problem. 'The keeper David de Gea was forced to stop training after suffering an injury to the fifth finger of his right hand,' read a statement on sefutbol, the national team's official website. 'Having suffered a similar situation in the past, De Gea will remain with the squad and will wait to see how he improves.' The Spain goalkeeper attempts to make a save low to his right during a session earlier this week . Fans stop to take pictures of De Gea as he arrived in Huelva with the Spain side on Thursday . The injury will come as a blow to De Gea, who had been hoping to push on after usurping Iker Casillas as Spain's No 1 goalkeeper last month. It's also massive blow for manager Louis van Gaal who already has an injury crisis among his defenders and could now lose his No 1 keeper for several weeks. He has started all 11 Premier League games so far for the Dutchman, keeping three clean sheets in the process. Van Gaal has a week to decide whether to go with reserve stopper Anders Lindegaard, who was told earlier this season he can leave Old Trafford, or offer a first-team opportunity to inexperienced Ben Amos, who has played for England Under 21s. Former Barcelona keeper Victor Valdes has also been training with the Red Devils as he completes his recovery from a knee injury. United already have a series of injury doubts, with as many as nine first-team players - including Radamel Falcao and Marcos Rojo - currently sidelined ahead of their next fixture at Arsenal on November 22.

Manuel Pellegrini’s squad moved across town this week in to their new £200m training base opposite the Etihad Stadium. Now it has emerged that the first team will effectively use the ‘Etihad Campus’ as a hotel the night before home games, eating and sleeping there before making their way across the road to the stadium. VIDEO Scroll down for Manchester City vs Spurs: The essential stats you need to know . Man City have built a new £200million training complex which includes 16 pitches called the Etihad Campus .

City have always used the Hilton on Manchester’s Deansgate but their players will now effectively have their own bedrooms at the training ground. Pellegrini will also expect his players to head back there after afternoon games for a meal and recuperation. It is understood that the players will not use the centre on Friday night ahead of Saturday’s game against Tottenham as only a third of the new training ground is fully operational. This means they could well use it for the first time ahead of the Manchester derby on November 2. David Silva walks past a poster featuring images from City's Premier League title-winning season .

City’s Elite Development Squad manager Patrick Vieira said: 'The first team will be able to stay there on the night before a home game, instead of going to a hotel. 'I think it’s an advantage to stay. 'When I played in Italy we had a place to stay after training. 'Normally, after training you want to go straight home so you don’t end up stuck in traffic, but here you can stay and have a treatment, and leave much later. It is more professional.' City are not the first team to have sleeping facilities at their training ground. Neighbours United, for example, installed rooms last year.

'This is the same practice that caused officers to be labeled racist and abusers of power.' 'Slowdown': NYPD commissioner Bill Bratton has admitted that his officers started making fewer arrests after two cops were executed in revenge for the death of Eric garner . A memo posted on the wall at a station house in Queens, informs officers that new vacation days will not be approved beyond already approved vacation days and that a doctor's note will be needed for sick days. On Friday Police Commissioner Bill Bratton announced that so many police officers had stopped writing tickets and making low-level arrests in the weeks since two officers were fatally shot that the number of summonses plummeted 90 percent. But Bratton said the problem at the nation's police largest department is on the mend and the numbers are already going back up. 'I would describe it as a slowdown,' Bratton said. 'They never stopped working, 911 calls were responded to, arrests continued to be made, crime continued to go down.' Numbers for low-level arrests like fare beating in the subway and public drunkenness were down by half and summonses for criminal activity were down more than 90 percent after the Dec. 20 shooting deaths of Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu in their patrol car. The officers were targeted by a mentally unstable man who vowed online to kill two 'pigs' in retaliation for the deaths of black men and boys at the hands of police around the country. The shootings caused a growing rancor between the rank and file and Mayor Bill de Blasio to boil over, as dozens of officers turned their backs on him at the hospital, and then thousands did at the funerals for the officers. There had been chatter of a deliberate slowdown because of the startling change in police statistics but Bratton did not confirm it until Friday, after he had taken a comprehensive look. He said he didn't know the cause of the slowdown, but he has said he realizes morale among some officers is low. Roy Richter, president of the police Captains Endowment Association, denied the drop in arrests was deliberate. 'Police officers never stopped their daily job of putting themselves in harm's way protecting New Yorkers,' Richter said in a statement. 'This past month we experienced an unparalleled drain on our resources policing protesters gone wild and horrible tragedy in the assassination of our two brothers in blue.' Bratton said he doesn't believe the slowdown affected safety and noted crime remains at historic lows. No officers were facing discipline. 'I don't think it's warranted,' he said. 'I'm very mindful of the extraordinarily stressful situations that the officers in the city found themselves in last month. And so we'll work to bring things back to normal.' One officer was suspended for insubordination during the period but it wasn't directly related to the slowdown. Bratton said no police union gave any official instruction to slow police action. He met this week with the union leaders, and with borough chiefs to discuss the issue. 'To encourage them to get out to the roll calls and start encouraging officers, now that we're out of the funerals and demonstrations, to get back to normal activity,' he said. The low enforcement activity prompted some to question Bratton's signature crime-fighting tool known as 'broken windows,' where low-level offenses were targeted to prevent more serious crime. But Bratton said Friday it had no major impact. 'The whole thesis of 'broken windows' is if over time you don't address an issue, over time it will create a larger issue,' he said.","One precinct - 105th Precinct in Queens - has reportedly been been told that time off is not allowed until police up their arrests and summonses .

"President Barack Obama and other top members of his administration have snubbed a historic rally in Paris today that brought together more than 40 world leaders from Europe, Africa, the Middle East and even Russia. 'France is our oldest ally,' Obama said during a speech Friday in Tennessee. 'I want the people of France to know that the United States stands with you today, stands with you tomorrow.' But he wasn't standing in Paris as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas put aside their differences and linked arms. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and Russian Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov made the same unifying gesture in the march down the Place de la Concorde in defiance of the Islamist terror attacks that rocked the city last week. According to an administration official, President Obama spent part of his Sunday afternoon watching a National Football League game on television. Both games were broadcast hours after the march. Heads of state from every major European power, including British Prime Minister David Cameron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, joined French President Francois Hollande. But the U.S.A. was M.I.A. Scroll down for video . MAKING A STATEMENT: World leaders walk side by side in a show of defiance and unity at a rally in response to the terror attacks that have taken place in France, including (left to right) British Prime Minister David Cameron, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Mali's President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, French President Francois Hollande and Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel . The Marche Republicaine saw numerous world leaders from Europe, Africa and the Middle East link arms and walk through the streets of Paris as a show of solidarity with France . OTHER ATTENDEES: Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt (second from left) Polish Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz (third from left) EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini (fourth from left) Thorbjorn Jagland, secretary-general of the Council of Europe, (fourth from left), President of the European council Donald Tusk (third from right), Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas (second from right) and Queen Rania (right) and King Abdullah II (not pictured) of Jordan and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov (not pictured) WHERE DID HE GO? Attorney General Eric Holder was in Paris on Sunday for a security summit, but did not appear alongside world leaders when they joined an anti-terrorism march in the afternoon - instead he slipped away to appear on several US morning shows . Obama and Vice President Joe Biden remained in Washington, despite having no events on their public schedules Sunday. Secretary of State John Kerry was a world away in India, on a pre-planned trip. Attorney General Eric Holder was in Paris for a terrorism summit held on the march's sidelines, but he slipped away and made appearances on four American morning television talk shows just as the incredible rally was starting. The US was represented at the march only by Jane Hartley, the American ambassador to France who is unrecognizable to most Americans, let alone the rest of the world. A senior administration official was quick to point out, however, that 'Attorney General Holder – a Cabinet level official – is representing the United States at the security meetings in Paris today.' 'He is joined by the DHS Deputy Secretary [Alejandro] Mayorkas,' the official added in a statement to many news outlets. 'The United States is represented at the march by Ambassador Hartley.' And 'as far as public signs of French solidarity from the U.S.,' the official concluded, 'don't forget several public statements from the president, his call to Hollande and a condolence stop to the French embassy.' Obama went to the French embassy in Washington, D.C. on Thurdsay to pay his respects, and signed a condolence book with the rallying cry 'Vive la France!' Holder, Obama's longest-serving cabinet member, was pictured shaking hands with French officials after the event, but he slipped away – as did Mayorgas – before the march kicked off around 3:00 p.m. The attorney general appeared on four Sunday morning talk shows around the same time as the march, although it's unclear whether he spoke live from Paris or if his segments were pre-recorded. The Department of Justice would not immediately comment on Holder's schedule with DailyMail.com, and a spokesperson for Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson similarly did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The White House press office also did not respond to a question seeking confirmation that the president was engrossed in the NFL playoffs on Sunday afternoon. Vice President Joe Biden often fills in for the president at events that require White House gravitas, but he was nowhere to be seen either, despite his own empty schedule. Among those who did attend were: Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, British Prime Minister David Cameron, Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Malian President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, European Union President Donald Tusk, Palestinian Authority President Mahmud Abbas, Queen Rania and King Abdullah II of Jordan, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and Russian Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov. EN MASSE: An estimated 1.3million people gathered at Republique Square in Paris, France on Sunday to demonstrate against the recent terrorist attack at the Charlie Hebdo offices which resulted in the death of more than a dozen people . Political opponents – and even some allies – were quick to criticize Obama for not showing up himself, or at least sending a senior administration official to represent him at the street-swelling rally. An incensed former Speaker of the house Newt Gingrich vented on Twitter and told DailyMail.com that it was 'sad that 50 world leaders could show solidarity in Paris but President Obama refused to participate.' 'The cowardice continues,' Gingrich jabbed, referring to Republicans' refrain that he has shown a weak hand when dealing with terrorism overseas. Politico reporter Ben White tweeted: 'Is it just me or does it feel like Obama should be at this big March in Paris?' Fox News host Greta Van Susteren wrote: 'This is really embarrassing – WHERE IS PRESIDENT OBAMA? Why didn't he go?' Obama's absence was notable as dozens of nations' show of solidarity unfolded before a global audience – especially considering his public schedule was wide open. According to Buzzfeed, Holder left Paris after the summit to return to Washington. Meanwhile, Secretary of State John Kerry was half a world away in India, preparing for the president's upcoming trip to the south Asian country in the coming weeks. SKIPPED: Both President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden's schedules were free today, but neither flew to Paris for the historic march. Pictured above in Clinton, Tennessee on Friday . OUT OF TOWN: Secretary of State John Kerry could not attend the rally because he was in India, preparing for President Obama's upcoming visit to the country. Pictured above on Sunday with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi . Protected: Security was an orchestrated effort, but that fact that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (left) joined shows how secure the dignitaries were. Pictured above with French President Francois Hollande (right) during a ceremony at the Grand Synagogue in Paris, following the march. Mistake? Several political talking heads called President Obama's absence a 'mistake'. Above, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas (center)  leaves the Elysee Palace to participate in the march . CNN's Jake Tapper reported that security for the march was difficult, with 2,300 police officers and paramilitary forces deployed to Paris. The foreign dignitaries were protected with police snipers, plainclothes cops and anti-terror officers. Streets were shut down and parking was restricted. However, the attendance of controversial heads of state like Netanyahu appeared to show that the march was well secured. 'I don't mean this as a criticism of the Obama administration,' Tapper said Sunday while reporting live from Paris, 'but just as an American I do wish that we were better represented in this beautiful procession of world leaders.' 'I'm a little disappointed, personally – this is me speaking personally, not as a representative of CNN, but as an American – that there isn't more of a display of unity here,' the host of 'The Lead' added. CNN's Fareed Zakaria was one of the many who noticed President Obama's absence, and remarked that it was a mistake not to show up and support our 'deepest ideological ally.' Zakaria said that it would have sent an important message to have an American face among the wold leaders. Forbes columnist Stuart Anderson echoed Zakaria's statements, saying: 'By not attending the unity rally in Paris on Sunday, President Obama has missed an opportunity to show leadership, to demonstrate that Americans are as committed to fight against terrorism as anyone in the world. 'And that America stands with its allies in a worldwide battle that, unfortunately, is likely to last many years.' The White House announced on Sunday that it would convene 'a Summit on Countering Violent Extremism' in February 'to highlight domestic and international efforts to prevent violent extremists and their supporters from radicalizing, recruiting, or inspiring individuals or groups in the United States and abroad to commit acts of violence.' A statement from White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest made no specific mention of Islam, Islamist terrorism, or Muslims in general.

"David Cameron should be replaced with an 'empty chair' if he refuses to take part in TV election debates, Ed Miliband said today. The Labour leader accused the Prime Minister of 'running scared' of taking him on in a live show down alongside Nick Clegg and Nigel Farage. It comes after Mr Cameron  ruled out taking part if Green Party leader Natalie Bennett is left out. Mr Cameron has insisted that the format being suggested by broadcasters was unfair because it includes Mr Farage but excludes the Greens. Scroll down for video . Labour leader Ed Miliband, appearing on the Andrew Marr Show this morning, said David Cameron was 'ducking and weaving' Former Conservative chairman Lord Tebbit has warned voters will think Mr Cameron is 'frit' - scared - if he dodges the live TV debates with his election rivals. The Labour leader this morning ramped up the rhetoric, calling on broadcasts to go ahead with the debates with or without the Conservative leader. Mr Miliband told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show: 'I think it is pretty disreputable that David Cameron went into the 2010 election saying that these debates were the most important thing that we could possibly have and people shouldn't make feeble excuses to get out of them, and he is doing precisely that. 'He is running scared of these debates. I want these debates to happen, I think they should happen with David Cameron or without David Cameron.' Mr Miliband told Andrew Marr David Cameron was 'running scared of these debates', adding: 'I want these debates to happen, I think they should happen with David Cameron or without David Cameron' David Cameron (left), Nick Clegg (centre) and former Prime Minister Gordon Brown (right) took part in the final live leaders' election debate, hosted by  the BBC in the Great Hall of Birmingham University on April 29, 2010 . The Labour leader added: 'In the end that's a matter for the broadcasters, but I don't think any one political leader should be able to stop these debates happen, should be able to veto these debates, block these debates. 'If an empty chair represents David Cameron in these debates, so be it. I think these debates need to happen. They are owned by the British people, not owned by David Cameron or anybody else. I think, frankly, the Prime Minister should stop ducking and weaving, trying to avoid these debates.' Under plans put forward by the major broadcasters in October, the Prime Minister would take on Mr Miliband alone in one debate, with another featuring the three mainstream party leaders and a third also including Mr Farage. Ex Conservative Party Chairman Lord Tebbit has said voters will think that David Cameron is 'frit' if he dodges live TV debates with other party leaders . Lord Tebbit's comment that Mr Cameron risks looking 'frit' is  a clear reference to Margaret Thatcher's 1983 taunt to then Labour deputy leader Denis Healey that he was scared of a general election. The Tory peer told The Observer: 'I don't think it is going to improve his image. I think the public will take the view that he is frit. 'And anyway, the public enjoy these confrontations. It is obviously going to be the most awful election campaign that anyone can remember, so to rob it even of this little bit of show, I think, would not be particularly pleasing to the public. 'It would certainly provide the opportunity for the other parties to say, 'What is wrong with him? Why doesn't he want to do it?' And for the more sophisticated audience, they will whisper quietly that the reason is that he bungled it in 2010.' Mr Cameron took on Nick Clegg and Labour prime minister Gordon Brown in the UK's first ever general election leaders' debates in 2010, which the Liberal Democrat leader was widely regarded to have won. Some Conservatives have blamed the debates for denying the party an overall majority. Mr Miliband and Mr Farage have  also mocked the Prime Minister after it emerged he would not take part in an online question and answer session with young voters - something that the Labour and Ukip leaders, the Deputy Prime Minister and Ms Bennett have all done. Conservative backbencher David Davis, who challenged Mr Cameron for the leadership in 2005, said that attempting to avoid TV debates 'may be right tactically' but was not realistic. Mr Davis told BBC1's Sunday Politics: 'It's unavoidable. They've got to have the debate. It will happen, in an internet age. The broadcasters are controlled, the newspapers aren't. 'We've seen the Telegraph proposing a debate. It will happen. The broadcasters will then be able to cover that, just as they did with Farage versus Clegg which was on LBC and then it was on the national news that evening. That's what will happen. It will get covered.'","Labour leader says the Prime Minister of 'running scared' of taking him on .

"A driver has been arrested after a woman who was walking along the M25 at 3am this morning was struck by a car and killed. The woman, in her thirties, died after she was hit by a black Volkswagen Golf as she walked along the motorway close to the Junction 13 slip road, near Staines, at 2.50am. A male driver has been arrested on suspicion of drink-driving and failing to stop. A woman died after she was hit by a vehicle as she walked along the M25 near Staines early this morning (file picture) Paramedics were quickly on the scene but the woman, who has not been named, was pronounced dead. Next of kin are yet to be informed. Police believe the driver failed to stop after the incident but was found further down the road by officers, who arrested him after he failed a breath test. He is being held in custody and will be interviewed later today. Surrey Police said it was not clear at this point why the woman was walking down the motorway. A police spokesman confirmed that the woman was local to the area and had not driven herself to the motorway. 'It doesn't appear that she's been hit by multiple vehicles, it's appears it was just the one. 'We're trying to establish whether she has walked there or whether she's been dropped off there and that is what the inquiry is focused on - what she was doing there.' The spokesman added that the force received two 999 calls from concerned members of the public in the minutes before the woman was hit. The M25 was closed anti-clockwise from Junction 14 at Heathrow Airport to Junction 12 near Chertsey, Surrey, for more than nine hours this morning, but has re-opened. Paramedics from both South East Coast and London Ambulance services were at the scene earlier this morning. A Highways Agency spokeswoman said the incident had not caused 'substantial disruption', but this could change as the morning goes on. Drivers are being diverted via the M3. Surrey Police said it was not clear at this point why the woman was walking down the motorway (file picture) A South East Coast Ambulance Service spokesman said: 'At 3am this morning we received reports that a pedestrian had been hit by a vehicle on the M25 near Junction 17. 'The incident was attended by an ambulance supported by a response car. Unfortunately the woman was pronounced dead at the scene. 'There were no other reports of injuries.' As police were dealing with the incident, a second collision involving a white minibus, a black Range Rover, a silver Vauxhall Meriva and a bronze Honda CRV, took place. The driver of the minibus, who was the sole occupant of the vehicle, was taken to St George's Hospital in Tooting with a serious leg injury and is expected to undergo surgery later today. The driver of the Range Rover was taken to St Peter's Hospital in Chertsey with a suspected neck injury. The occupants of the other vehicles involved escaped uninjured but were treated at the scene for shock.

"The family of kosher supermarket jihadist Amedy Coulibaly have condemned the attacks in Paris and offered their condolences to the victims. Gunman Coulibaly died in a hail of bullets when armed police stormed the Hyper Cacher grocery, where he had held terrified staff and shoppers hostage. Four hostages were shot dead in the seige, which came the day after 32-year-old Coulibaly murdered a policewoman in Montrouge, to the south of the French capital. Scroll down for video . The family of kosher supermarket jihadist Amedy Coulibaly, shown here in a 'suicide' video, have condemned the attacks in Paris and offered their condolences to the victims' families . Now his mother and sisters have spoken out against the attacks, saying they offer their 'sincere condolences' to the families of those killed. 'We condemn these acts,' they said in a statement. 'We absolutely do not share these extreme ideas. We hope there will not be any confusion between these odious acts and the Muslim religion.' Gunman Coulibaly died in a hail of bullets when armed police stormed the Hyper Cacher grocery, where he had held terrified staff and shoppers hostage . Freed hostages from the Hyper Cacher are led away by police officers. Four people were killed during the seige, but 15 were rescued . Coulibaly had threatened to kill his hostages if police attempted to storm the Charlie Hebdo terrorists Cherif and Said Kouachi who, at the time, were engaged in a similar standoff with police. Cherif Kouachi's wife, who was held for 72 hours after the Charlie Hebdo attack, has also condemned the killings, according to one of her lawyers. Lawyer Christian Saint-Palais said the woman had 'the same reaction to the rest of the national community' to the shootings, which had left her 'stunned'. He said she had also expressed her sympathy for the victims, and had been unaware of her husband's terrorist plans. In the hours after the dramatic raid on the store, an Israeli government official said 15 hostages were rescued while French president Francois Hollande confirmed that four people were killed. They were later named as Yohan Cohen, 22, Yoav Hattab, 21 Philippe Braham, in his forties, and François-Michel Saada, thought to be in his sixties. Coulibaly was also responsible for the fatal shooting of 27-year-old policewoman Clarissa Jean-Philippe on Thursday. It has now been suggested this attack may have been an aborted attempt to attack a Jewish school. Authorities are still searching for Coulibaly's widow, Hayat Boumeddiene, (left) who is described as an 'armed and dangerous' suspect . In an apparent suicide video which emerged today, Coulibaly confirmed his links to the Kouchi brothers, and pledged his allegiance to Islamic State . In a telephone interview with television station BFM from inside the grocery store, Coulibaly explained that he and the Kouachis 'synchronized the operations' and that while the brothers attacked Charlie Hebdo, 'I started to do the police.' In an apparent suicide video which emerged today, Coulibaly confirmed his links to the brothers, saying: 'The brothers of our team, they did Charlie Hebdo. 'I also went out a bit against the police so that it has more impact. We managed to synchronise to come out at the same time.' 'What we have done is completely legitimate given what they have done. If you attack the caliphate, we will attack you.' Along with the Kouachi brothers, Coulibaly was part of the so-called Buttes-Chaumont network that helped send jihadists to Iraq to fight for al-Qaeda. Like Cherif Kouachi, Coulibaly was named in connection with a 2010 plot to help fellow Islamist, Smain Ait Ali Belkacem, who bombed the Paris metro in 1995, injuring 30 people, escape from prison. Coulibaly was jailed for five years for his part in the plot, but was released from jail two months ago. Authorities are still searching for Coulibaly's widow, Hayat Boumeddiene, 26, who is described as an 'armed and dangerous' suspect. She once posed for a photo holding a crossbow in her Islamic veil, and is wanted by French police for helping Coulibaly prepare terrorist acts.","Mother and sister of hostage taker Coulibaly speak out against attacks .

"Myleene Klass won a whole new legion of fans after she took on Ed Miliband over his 'mansion tax in November last year. The former singer tore into the Labour leader's plans to tax properties worth more than £2million, calming it would hit 'little grannies' and not the super-wealthy. However, it has emerged that the 36-year-old TV presenter's crusade may not have been so selfless, as she recently bought a £3million house in North London. Scroll down for video . Taxing issues: Myleene Klass has just purchased a £3million home in London, which would come under Labour's proposed mansion tax . Miss Klass tackled  Ed Miliband on live TV over Labour's proposed mansion tax, claiming the tax would his 'grannies' and Londoners living in garage-sized homes . Ms Klass and Mr Miliband went head to head on ITV's The Agenda in November, where she accused the Labour leader of not understanding what you would get for £2million in London. 'For me, what is so disturbing is the name in its own right: ""mansion"",' Ms Klass fumed. 'Immediately you conjure up in your head these Barbie-esque houses but in London, which is where 80 per cent of the people who are going to be paying this tax actually live, have you seen what that amount of money can get you? Often it's like a garage. ''The people who are the super-super rich buying their houses for £140 million, this is not necessarily going to affect them because they've got their tax rebates and their amazing accountants. It's going to be the little grannies who have lived in those houses for years and years.' Ms Klass is thought to have purchased the multi-million pound home in an affluent area of the capital last summer, but it is not yet known if she and her two daughters have moved in. Myleene has recently purchased a £3million eight-bedroom home on this leafy street in north London . 'Mellow in yellow': Myleene Klass has been documenting her recent holiday on social media sites . 'Love is...': The TV and music beauty shared an adorable snap of herself with her daughters Ava and Hero, from their recent holiday abroad at an unknown destination . Ms Klass recently lived in a rented house nearby, and her move was revealed when she filed the paperwork for the business with Companies House last month. The house sold for £3,075,000 last summer and has eight bedrooms, four bathrooms and three reception rooms. A demographic area profile describes Ms Klass's new neighbourhood as 'home to an older and often retired population some with school age children.' Ms Klass's new homestead is not far from fellow TV-profile Jonathan Ross, but the area is otherwise not considered a celebrity hub. This week, the former former Pop Idol star returned from her New Year's holiday on a mystery island location with some of her loved ones, including daughters Ava, seven, and Hero, three. The mother-of-two ensured she mixed business and pleasure, and has been posting images of herself in swimwear, from her own Littlewoods collection. Myleene split from the girls' father and her partner of 10 years, Graham Quinn, back in April 2012 when he walked out of the marital home on her 34th birthday. But the star has since found love once again with a mystery man, whose identity she has managed to keep under wraps. Speaking about her new boyfriend, Myleene recently told Women's Health magazine: 'I’ve learnt how to laugh and be fun and to not feel like just ""Mum"" again . 'He doesn’t work in the business,’ she added. 'A girl’s got to keep something to herself and ultimately you just want a nice guy.’","Myleene Klass famously attacked Ed Miliband over mansion tax .

"The wet and wild conditions that have caused havoc in parts of Britain are expected to continue this week as the country is blighted by another severe weather system. After thousands were left without power in the North last week following hurricane-force gusts, a series of storms will stir up more bitterly cold winds. Temperatures will plummet across the country, and there is a chance of snow, hail and thunder in many areas. Heavy rain is also expected to cause a flooding risk in the coming days. Scroll down for video . Engineers are hoping to restore power to 12,700 people in Scotland still without power after twin Atlantic storms damaged buildings, power lines and brought snow and ice at the weekend, causing travel chaos and cutting power to around 100,000 homes in northern Scotland . The Met Office has issued several yellow ‘be prepared’ warnings for huge swathes of the country today, warning of rain, snow and strong winds. Higher areas in the North were blanketed in their first snowfall of the year yesterday morning, with more widespread snowfall likely in coming days. Gusts could reach speeds of up 80mph today in northern areas, causing traffic disruption as another area of low pressure descends on the UK. Last week’s fierce winds, caused by a powerful 250mph jetstream moving from the US over Scotland, left more than 100,000 people without power, damaged buildings and led to multiple road closures. Those in Scotland, the North-East, North-West and Yorkshire have been told to expect no let-up in the battering winds today, while heavy rain is expected in the South-East. The Environment Agency has issued 15 flood warnings across the country. Temperatures are also likely to plummet tomorrow, worsened by the chilly wind, and snow is expected in the Lake District, Snowdonia, the Pennines and Scotland. Wintry showers will continue throughout the country on Wednesday, with northern and western areas more likely to see snowfall. A further area of low pressure will cause the ‘most disturbed conditions’ of the week on Wednesday afternoon before the storms finally subside.

"Anita Ekberg, the Swedish-born actress who is best known for her role in Federico Fellini's La Dolce Vita, has died at the age of 83. La Dolce Vita actress Anita Ekberg has died at the age of 83 . The moment where her character Sylvia, wades through Rome's Trevi Fountain in nothing but a strapless black dress is remembered as one the most iconic scenes ever in a movie and one which turned her into a fully-fledged sex-symbol. Ekberg's lawyer Patrizia Ubaldi confirmed she died in Rome on Sunday morning following a series of illnesses. She had been hospitalised most recently after Christmas. Ubaldi said that in her last days Ekberg was saddened by the illness and her advancing age. 'She had hoped to get better, something that didn't happen,' she said. Ubaldi added that a ceremony would be held in the coming days at a Lutheran church in Rome, and that Ekberg had specified that her remains be cremated. Born on Sept. 29, 1931, in the southern city of Malmo, Ekberg grew up with seven siblings. In 1951 she won the Miss Sweden competition, after being recommended to enter by organisers who saw her on the street, and went to the United States to compete for the Miss Universe title. She didn't win but became a model in Hollywood and later started taking on small acting roles. Her role in Federico Fellini's La Dolce Vita - where she played a movie star - shot her to stardom. The movie was a colossal success and came to define the wild and carefree days of the early 1960s. Death of an icon: Swedish actress Anita Ekberg, best known for her role in Federico Fellini's La Dolce Vita, has died in hospital in Rome following a 'series of illnesses' Hosting a Swedish radio program in 2005, Ekberg recalled shooting the scene in the Trevi Fountain in Rome. She said it was shot in February, the water in the fountain was cold and co-star Marcello Mastroianni was falling over in the fountain drunk on vodka. 'And there I was. I was freezing,' she said. 'They had to lift me out of the water because I couldn't feel my legs anymore.' 'I have seen that scene a few times. Maybe too many times. I can't stand watching it anymore, but it was beautiful at the time,' she said. Ekberg had long lived in Italy, the country that gave her worldwide fame thanks to the iconic dip opposite Mastroianni. Death of an icon: Ekberg's lawyer Patrizia Ubaldi confirmed she died in Rome on Sunday morning following a series of illnesses . Humble beginnings to superstar: Born on Sept. 29, 1931, in the southern city of Malmo, Ekberg grew up with seven siblings before going on to find fame in movies . Big break: In 1951 she won the Miss Sweden competition, after being recommended to enter by organisers who saw her on the street, and went to the United States to compete for the Miss Universe title . Her curvaceous body and glamorous social life made her a favorite of tabloid press in the Fifties and Sixties. She married twice but never had children - a fact she came to regret later in her life. Some gossip magazines called her The Iceberg in a nod to her Scandinavian background. But even as she became one of Sweden's most famous exports, Ekberg maintained a problematic relation with her native country. She never starred in a Swedish film and was often at odds with Swedish journalists, who criticised her for leaving the country and ridiculed her for adopting an American accent. Ekberg remained in Italy for years, appearing in scores of movies, many forgettable. She returned in two Fellini movies: Clowns and Intervista. Glamorous: Anita (pictured in 1960) became a pin-up following her breakout role in La Dolce Vita . Glamorous: Anita's curvaceous body and glamorous social life made her a favorite of tabloid press in the Fifties and Sixties . Ekberg married Briton Anthony Steel in 1956, but divorced him four years later. In 1963 she married again to actor Rik van Nutter, but that marriage also failed. In an interview with Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet in 2006, Ekberg said her only regret in life was never having children. 'I would have liked to have a child, preferably a son,' she was quoted as saying. 'It didn't turn out that way. That's life, you just have to accept it.' Not exactly romantic: Ekberg recalled shooting the famous scene in the Trevi Fountain in Rome, explaining it was shot in February, the water in the fountain was cold and co-star Marcello Mastroianni was falling over drunk on vodka . Chemistry: Mastroianni may have been 'falling over drunk on vodka' but the pair had incredible chemistry which won over audiences . In the interview, published in connection with Ekberg's 75th birthday, she also said she wasn't afraid of death. 'I'm just angry because I won't get the chance to tell others about death, where the soul goes and if there is a life afterward,' she was quoted as saying. 'I don't know if paradise or hell exist, but I'm sure hell is more groovy.' Twice divorced: Ekberg married Briton Anthony Steel in 1956, but divorced him four years later. In 1963 she married again to actor Rik van Nutter, but that marriage also failed . Not just a one-trick pony: Anita also starred in Four For Texas alongside Frank Sinatra . Regrets:  Ekberg (pictured in 1956), who became a sex symbol following her breakout role in La Dolce Vita, was married twice and said her greatest regret was not having any children .

"One of the world's finest collections of Victorian wrought-iron horse-drawn carriages is set to be sold for a total of £1.5million. The group of 28 coaches, which were built long before the invention of the automobile, have been amassed by a European-based collector over the past 30 years. The pick of the group is an 1835 Traveling Landauer wagon that was commissioned by the Royal Mews worth £300,000. A collection of Victorian wrought-iron horse-drawn carriages is to sell for an expected £1.5million. Pictured, the 1835 Traveling Landauer . The level of luxury that went into making the extravagant Traveling Landauer wagon is said to be beyond that of Rolls Royce standard of today . The extravagant coach was made by Adams & Hooper of London and used to carry King William IV on his Royal duties until his death just two years later. The level of luxury and detail that went into making it is said to be beyond that of Rolls Royce standard of today. There is an 1892 Road Coach made by renowned coachbuilders Holland & Holland that is expected to sell for £150,000 while a similar French-made carriage from a similar period is said to be worth £100,000. And a carriage once owned by luxury champagne producers Veuve Clicquot to take clients to their vineyards is valued at £25,000. As well as the 28 carriages, there are six children-sized coaches and more than 150 items of memorabilia, including period lamps, luggage, picnic sets, tack and photographs.

Rob Hubbard, of London auctioneers Bonhams, said: 'The owner is a Dutch collector but a lot of the carriages he has were made by English coachbuilders. 'He has spent over 30 years collecting but he is now aged in his 80s and he no longer has any horses left and has decided now to pass it on to somebody else. 'These carriages are all exceptional in quality, you rarely see them in such good condition. 'The Royal Mews carriage is luxurious and has 50 yards of individually stitched cord. The attention to detail is beyond the Rolls Royce standard while the Veuve Clicquot carriage's seats are made from pure silk.' The auction takes place on March 7.

"With stunning views, finely-dressed doormen and enviable locations, they are desirable homes. But these ten skyscrapers, situated in the heart of Manhattan, New York, are remarkably empty. That is because up to a huge 74 per cent of their wealthy - often, foreign - residents live elsewhere. Instead, they rent out apartments in the buildings either as pieds-à-terre or investment properties. Highest proportion: At Executive Plaza (pictured), a skyscraper situated in Manhattan, New York, 74.4 per cent of the apartments are nonprimary residences, according to the New York City Independent Budget Office . Second and third: Meanwhile, 60.5 per cent of the residential floors at CitySpire (left) in West 56th Street, and 54.2 per cent of those at Three Worldwide Plaza  (right) are made up of investment flats and second homes . For example, although the marble lobby at CitySpire - a 72-story tower in West 56th Street - may appear to have an endless stream of people, this does not reflect the building's true occupancy. Instead, more than 60 per cent of its residential floors are made up of investment properties and second homes, according to new figures from the New York City Independent Budget Office. Speaking to the New York Times, a tenant at the 814ft skyscraper - situated near the prestigious Carnegie Hall -  said the majority of the people there are delivery workers or visiting businessmen. 'If you pay attention to the lobby on a Friday or a Monday, you’ll see a lot of key exchanges taking place and people with suitcases coming and going,' said the resident, Nicholas Richards. Fourth and fifth: Other largely unoccupied skyscrapers include The Vanderbilt (left, 52.6 per cent) in East 40th Street, Murray Hill, and Zeckendorf Towers (right, 51 per cent), situated on the eastern side of Union Square . Unoccupied: The lobby of Zeckendorf Towers - also dubbed One Irving Place and One Union Square East . Sixth: At The Parc Vendôme (pictured), 49.7 per cent of apartments are pieds-à-terre or investment properties. The condominium complex is situated on 340 West 57th Street, close to both Central Park and 5th Avenue . CitySpire, originally built in 1987 by Ian Bruce Eichner, boasts a fitness center with a 50-foot pool and a garage. In 2012, it unveiled a luxury penthouse costing a whopping $100million. Meanwhile, at Executive Plaza, a skyscraper situated in West 51st Street, an enormous 74.4 per cent of the apartments - the highest proportion in the figures - are nonprimary residences. The building, which is a short walk away from 5th Avenue shops and Central Park, allows people to rent out apartments by the month. The below list reveals the top ten 'emptiest' skyscrapers in New York City, alongside the proportion of their apartments that are rented out as pieds-à-terre or investment properties: . 1. Executive Plaza (74.4%) 2. CitySpire (60.5%) 3. Three Worldwide Plaza (54.2%) 4. The Vanderbilt (52.6%) 5. Zeckendorf Towers (51%) 6. The Parc Vendôme (49.7%) 7. Madison Green (47.2%) 8. Continental Towers (47%) 9. The Corinthian (40%) 10. Kips Bay Towers (37.1%) Sources: New York City Independent Budget Office/New York Times . For a one-bedroom apartment rental, the price typically ranges from around $3,500 to $5500. In addition to CitySpire's (60.5 per cent) and Executive Plaza's high proportion of nonprimary residences, other largely unoccupied buildings include Three Worldwide Plaza in West 49th Street (54.2 per cent) and The Vanderbilt in East 40th Street (52.6 per cent) in Murray Hill. Meanwhile, 51 per cent of residents at Zeckendorf Towers - a 29-story tower near Union Square - and 49.7 per cent of those at The Parc Vendôme - based in West 51th Street - live elsewhere, the figures reveal. At Madison Green - a 31-story condominium building  on the corner of East 23rd Street and Broadway - 47.2 per cent of apartments are pieds-à-terre or investment properties. A slightly fewer 47 per cent of residences at Continental Towers in East 79th Street, and 40 per cent of apartments at The Corinthian on Madison Avenue, are nonprimary. And at Kips Bay Towers in the Kips Bay neighborhood, 37.1 per cent of tenants do not use the building as their primary home, the data shows. The figures are a reflection of the massive proportion (25 per cent) of co-op and condo apartments in New York City that are not used as primary residences - many, by millionaire foreigners. 'Twenty-four percent of co-op and condo apartments citywide are not the primary residence of their owners,' George V. Sweeting, the deputy director of the budget office, told the newspaper. 'Not all of these units are pieds-à-terre; many are likely owned by investors or original sponsors.' Seventh and eighth: At Madison Green (left) - a 31-story, 424-unit condominium building situated on the corner of East 23rd Street and Broadway - 47.2 per cent of apartments are not primary residences. Meanwhile, a slightly fewer 47 per cent of residences at Continental Towers (right) in East 79th Street are nonprimary . Empty: This picture shows the lobby at Madison Green in the Flatiron District neighborhood of Manhattan . For a social purpose:  The common room at the apartment complex, which was designed by Philip Birnbaum . In recent years, the issue has proved controversial, with many complaining that residents who buy expensive apartments to use for just a few weeks a year do not have to pay personal income taxes. The figures were acquired by the budget office using data based on the New York City co-op and condominium tax abatement. In recent years, this has been restricted to only primary residences. Therefore, the office compared the number of apartments receiving the abatement in 2012 to the number received it this year. However, this means that the data does not include apartment buildings with 421a tax exemptions - excluding a number of recently-built condos in Manhattan. 'There are a lot of misses, but of the condos and co-ops that are captured, the number of nonprimary residents is high,' said Andrew Beveridge, the president of a firm tracking census data and demographic information, and the chairman of Queens College's sociology department. Ninth and tenth: Forty per centr cent of apartments at The Corinthian (left), which opened in 1988 on Madison Avenue, and 37.1 per cent of those at Kips Bay Towers, both also in Manhattan, are nonprimary residences . He added that the figures reflect the increasing levels of income inequality in New York City. Earlier this year, it was revealed that there has been a rise in the number of Chinese investors snapping up apartments in New York after finding they can get more for their money in Manhattan than Shanghai or Hong Kong. Russians used to dominate the property market in the city, but their interest has dropped since the crisis in Ukraine and the increasing threat of sanctions. The number of buyers from China is nearly a fifth higher than it was this time last year, with many signing deals on properties they haven't even viewed in person. 'By far and away, the Chinese are the fastest-growing demographic,' Dean Jones, of Sotheby's International, said in April.","Up to 74% of residents at the skyscrapers live elsewhere, figures reveal .

"A wolverine appears to be thriving in the northern Sierra Nevada seven years after being confirmed as the first one in California since 1922, researchers said. More than two dozen documented sightings of the solitary predator have occurred since it was first observed in March 2008 about 15 miles northwest of Truckee, said Chris Stermer, a biologist with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. The same wolverine is believed to have been last detected in November by a motion-sensing camera in the Tahoe National Forest near Fordyce Lake, which is only some 15 miles southwest of where it was originally seen. A wolverine appears to be thriving in the northern Sierra Nevada seven years after being confirmed as the first one in California since 1922, researchers said . The male appears healthy with dense fur and ample weight, Stermer said, and has staked out a 300-square-mile swath of the Sierra between Interstate 80 and Highway 49 as its territory. 'I think it's exciting,' he said. 'It gives us some hope of bringing back some apex predators like that. It would be exciting to have wolverines back in the Sierra.' Though its DNA has been linked to wolverines in Idaho's Sawtooth Range, biologists are still unsure whether it wandered down to California or was released into the Sierra by someone. Positive identification of the wolverine spotted Nov. 3 near Fordyce Lake is pending genetic testing by the U.S. Forest Service's Rocky Mountain Research Station in Fort Collins, Colorado. Some of its fur was obtained for the test. The male appears healthy with dense fur and ample weight, Stermer said, and has staked out a 300-square-mile swath of the Sierra between Interstate 80 and Highway 49 as its territory . 'Based on our history it's most likely going to be the same individual, but our hope is it's not,' Stermer said. 'Our hope is we have a pair here so they can mate ... We're hoping that one animal turns into a population.' The odds are good over time that some wolverines will venture south to California from Idaho and the Cascades, he added. Once found throughout the Sierra and Rocky Mountains, wolverines were wiped out across most of the U.S. by the 1930s due to unregulated trapping and poisoning campaigns, said Bob Inman, a wolverine researcher with the Wildlife Conservation Society. In the decades since, they largely have recovered in parts of the West, where 250 to 300 of the animals live, but not in other parts of their historical range. Positive identification of the wolverine spotted Nov. 3 near Fordyce Lake is pending genetic testing by the U.S. Forest Service's Rocky Mountain Research Station in Fort Collins, Colorado . In the Lower 48, they live primarily in Montana, Idaho, Wyoming and Washington. Larger populations persist in Alaska and Canada. California has the habitat to support higher wolverine numbers, Stermer said, and his agency has discussed the possibility of reintroducing them to the state. 'They avoid residential areas and livestock. There's not a lot of controversy with having wolverines around,' he said. 'How many pairs can the habitat support? That's the question.' The rarely seen members of the weasel family have a reputation for ferocity and strength out of proportion to their size. Adults are about as big as medium-size dogs.","More than two dozen documented sightings of the solitary predator have occurred since it was first observed in March 2008 .
The male appears healthy with dense fur and ample weight and has staked out a 300-square-mile swath of the Sierra between Interstate 80 and Highway 49 as its territory .
Though its DNA has been linked to wolverines in Idaho's Sawtooth Range, biologists are still unsure whether it wandered down to California or was released into the Sierra ."
"A Missouri teacher has shared his remarkable story at losing almost 350 pounds and regaining power over his life. Ryan Blocker says he found himself in all kinds of trouble when he tipped the scales at 550 pounds two years ago. The Lilbourn High School teacher, who was 28 at the time, was so fat he could hardly manage the most basic of tasks, and was reliant on three blood pressure medications just to get through each day.

"Sunrise co-host Andrew O'Keefe has defended his on-air argument with a Herald Sun columnist branding those who argue Muslims are not doing anything to combat extremism as 'ignorant'. O'Keefe and Rita Panahi went head-to-head on Monday morning over the role of Islam in the recent Paris terror attacks. Rita Panahi told the Seven Network breakfast show that Muslims should 'start discussing intelligently and meaningfully' the links between their community and Islamic extremists - including ISIS. The discussion between Panahi, O'Keefe, his co-host Samantha Armytage and Radio 4BC's Patrick Condren then became clearly heated when O'Keefe claimed Muslims were no more responsible for the actions of Islamic extremists than Christians were for attacks carried out by fundamentalists. O'Keefe went on to cite attacks on abortion clinics and the Oslo massacre carried out by Anders Breivik as examples of terror that were not more broadly linked to Christianity - and at one point produced his phone to help prove his point. The Sunrise co-host stood his ground on Monday afternoon, while acknowledging that the issue was not about taking sides but about peace. 'Let me make it very clear…I in no way support the acts of unspeakable terror perpetrated by Muslim extremists. Or any other acts of violent extremism perpetrated falsely in the name of any God. This is not a matter of taking sides….it's about standing up for peace,' O'Keefe told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video and reader poll . Sunrise co-host Andrew O'Keefe (right) engaged in a fiery debate with a guest on Monday morning . Who won the Sunrise debate? Who won the Sunrise debate? Now share your opinion . 'My point to Rita was primarily that we ARE talking about this, and moderate Muslim leaders in Australia ARE seeking to combat extremism. Check out the work of Jamal Rifi, or Kuranda Seyit, or Samier Dandan, or the mufti himself. 'To pretend that Muslims are not engaged in the debate about extremism is just ignorant. Australia's Muslim leaders have been vocal about ISIS, about Martin Place, and about Paris, condemning those acts as crimes against Islam and humanity, and talking about the kinds of actions Australia's Muslims are undertaking at the grassroots to combat extremism. 'To claim that they need to ""step up"" ignores the fact that they're stepping up already. 'How heartbreaking it must be to constantly defend your religion against the actions of those who seek to misuse it for evil,' the co-host said. Rita Panahi also stood by her comments, but admitted she was 'taken aback' by the fierce turn the conversation took. 'I think Andrew inadvertently proved the point that I was making in the article which is this eagerness to make excuses,' she told Daily Mail Australia. The columnist also said her words were misinterpreted adding: 'What Andrew was claiming I was saying I wasn't actually saying... I'm not seeking the blame the greater community for the claims of the extremists.' O'Keefe and Rita Panahi (pictured) passionately argued over whether Islam was the only religion to have people commit acts of terror . While the debate was ongoing co-host Samantha Armytage (left in left image) kept quiet as did other guest Patrick Condren (bottom right) Panahi said O'Keefe's argument that many members of other religions committing 'such atrocities' was irrelevant as 'it's 2015 and Islam falls at the centre.' 'There's no point worrying about what happened 300 years ago even 30 years ago,' she said adding that it was important to recognise what is happening now. 'We need to start discussing intelligently and meaningfully the issues we have with the Muslim community,' Panahi began in the Sunrise segment, citing the angle she took in an article published on Monday morning. The columnist continued by saying that a discussion needs to be ignited about why such acts of terror are occurring, adding 'they quite clearly have everything to do with Islam'. Panahi then asked: 'What can we do to bring the Muslim community into the mainstream even more' before O'Keefe cut her off. At one point O'Keefe took out this phone to look up an answer to one of Panahi's questions and prove his point . 'But we're already discussing this - we've been discussing it for a long time Rita and every time a bunch of fundamentalist Christians in the United States bomb an abortion clinic or bomb a synagogue do we hold every Christian in the world to account for that?' O'Keefe argued. Panahi deemed his argument 'nonsensical' before O'Keefe then accused his guest of 'holding the majority responsible for the actions of a very small minority'. She argued that she was not doing that, and insisted that it was time to stop pretending Islam was like any other religion, suggesting instead that it was the only such one at the centre of any act of terror around the world. While this debate was raging co-host Samantha Armytage didn't say a word while the other guest Patrick Condren sat looking rather amused at the conversation. Panahi and O'Keefe continued the debate about what classified an act of terror with O'Keefe firmly standing his ground over the fact that not only Muslims were committing such acts, again referencing the bombing of abortion clinics in America. At many stages during the debate O'Keefe cut off Panahi . When asked by Panahi when the last time such an event took place the Sunrise co-host admitted 'off the top of his head' he wasn't sure but vowed to find out picking up his phone to search online. Condren was eventually bought into the conversation and described the issue as 'very emotional' before declaring 'I've got to say, I'm in the Andrew camp.' 'Where was this conversation when the IRA were bombing England and parts if Ireland on the basis of their Catholic religion?' the radio host asked. 'It think it's very very easy to marginalise Muslims because people don't understand the religion ... and it's too easy to marginalise them when you've got the prime minister of Australia saying he finds the burqa ""very confronting"",' Condren added. Panahi then weighed back in asking her fellow guest if he found that burqa confronting to which he said 'Rita I don't find it confronting in any way shape or form. 'I’m not that narrow-minded,' Condren added. Panahi asked Condren if he found the burqa confronting, to which he replied he didn't and he was not that narrow-minded . The conversation wrapped up with O'Keefe stating that the last attack on an abortion clinic was in 2009 as co-host Samantha tried to finish up the segment. Since the heated debate Twitter has been alight with conversation about the discussion, with viewers weighing in passionately on both sides. Even Panahi tried to keep the conversation going, tweeting about the exchange following her appearance. 'Interesting discussion on @sunriseon7 according to Andrew O'Keefe Islam extremists are no bigger problem than extremes of others religions,' she wrote. It's that type of wilful blindness that has categorised the debate thus far', Panahi said in another post.","Sunrise co-host Andrew O'Keefe engaged in a fiery debate with a guest .

"A state judge has ordered the NYPD to turn over records about an X-ray van program the department has kept shrouded in secrecy. New York State Supreme Court Judge Doris Ling-Cohan wrote in a decision back in December that radiation used in the vans raised concerns over health risks and said the department's claims about information being used by terrorists to evade detection was 'mere speculation.' For years, the New York Police Department has deployed unmarked white vehicles known as Z-backscatter vans used to detect bomb-making equipment, narcotics and other material. Ordered: A state judge ruled the NYPD must turn over records about a program using X-ray vans, similar to that pictured here, that the department has kept shrouded in secrecy . But the NYPD has refused to make details of the program known to the public about how the department uses the vehicles to conduct searches, raising privacy concerns. The low levels of radiation emitted by backscatter technology has also been shown to mutate DNA and thus increase the risk of cancer, which led the EU to ban backscatter technology in European airports back in 2011. The danger posed by the type of radiation used in the scanners is not known, though studies suggest even at low levels, it can increase cancer risk, especially through prolonged exposure. The scanners emit a 40 percent higher dose of radiation than an airport backscatter scanner, according to the court decision. Though little is known about how the NYPD deploys the vans, they made an appearance in the book Bomb Squad, written by two investigative reporters from ABC. The book describes how, during the 2004 Republican national convention in New York, drivers turning onto a street by the venue had to pass through two X-ray vans that scanned cars for explosives. Revealing: A photo on the website of AS&E shows how the technology can be used to reveal contraband, such as smuggled bottles of alcohol . Scanns: The technology can also be used to spot materials like hidden currency, though reports say the NYPD uses scanners to detect bomb material . The December ruling to release documents came after almost three years of legal wrangling by investigative reporting outfit ProPublica. In February 2012, the outlet filed a petition under the Freedom of Information Law, or FOIL, for the NYPD to provide documents relating to the Z-backscatter vans. It asked for information on police procedures, training documents, purchase records and safety tests, as well as legal decisions or interpretations used by the department to support the deployment of vans. The outlet also requested information on data produced by the scanners and stored by the NYPD, along with the image scans still held by the department. The department refused, with former NYPD deputy commissioner of counterterrorism telling the court in 2013 that revealing the information would put New Yorkers at risk. The release of records would 'permit those seeking to evade detection to conform their conduct to the times, places and methods that avoid NYPD presence and are thus most likely to yield a successful attack,' Daddario said. Judge Ling-Cohan said the claim was 'patently insufficient' to justify withholding information, considering the risks to both health and privacy. 'This court is cognizant and sensitive to concerns about terrorism, being located less than a mile from the 9-11 site, and having seen first-hand the effects of terrorist destruction,' Ling-Cohan wrote in her decision. 'Nonetheless, the hallmark of our great nation is that it is a democracy, with a transparent government.' NYPD spokesperson Nick Paolucci said on Thursday that the NYPD was planning to appeal the decision.","New York State Supreme Court Judge Doris Ling-Cohan ruled back in December that the department had to turn over information to ProPublica .

So far the NYPD has refused to turn over any information for examination ."
"Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt took a tumble as she tripped at the foot of a flight of steps while attending today's Paris rally. The blonde was left on her hands and knees after slipping as she left the Elysee Palace, where world leaders attending the march through the French capital had gathered. Ms Thorning-Schmidt, 48, who had been wearing a perilously high pair of heeled boots, had to be helped to her feet by aides after falling as she left the meeting. Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt took a tumble  at the foot of a flight of steps while attending today's Paris rally . The blonde was left on her hands and knees after slipping as she left the Elysee Palace, where world leaders attending the march through the French capital had gathered . Ms Thorning-Schmidt, who had been wearing a perilously high pair of heeled boots, had to be helped to her feet by aides after falling as she left the meeting . It is not the first time mother-of-two Ms Thorning-Schmidt has gained the attention of photographers during a prestigious event. In December 2013, she was seen taking a selfie with US President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron during Nelson Mandela's memorial service. The three world leaders were sitting alongside one another at the service in Johannesburg when they leaned in to take the smiling self-portrait. Ms Thorning-Schmidt, who is married to former Labour leader Neil Kinnock's son Stephen, and Mr Obama were also seen laughing and chatting during the ceremony, while his wife Michelle looked on, seemingly unimpressed. Defending her actions, Thorning-Schmidt said: 'There were lots of pictures taken that day, and I just thought it was a bit fun. Maybe it also shows that when we meet heads of state and government, we too are just people who have fun.' Ms Thorning-Schmidt was the picture of elegance as she arrived at the Palace, where she was greeted by French President Francois Hollande . Ms Thorning-Schmidt was among the dozens of world leaders who stood arm in arm as they led a defiant march through Paris in the wake of the terror attacks that shocked the French capital . Ms Thorning-Schmidt was among the dozens of world leaders who stood arm in arm as they led a defiant march through Paris in the wake of the terror attacks that shocked the French capital. Families of some of the 17 victims were also among the crowds which descended on the city from across the globe to show their solidarity with Parisians mourning the deaths. Mr Cameron, France's president Francois Hollande and other European leaders broke into spontaneous applause amid cheers, chants of 'Charlie, Charlie' and choruses of the French national anthem La Marseillaise as the march got under way from the Place de la Republique. Ahead of the rally, Mr Hollande had declared: 'Today, Paris is the capital of the world. 'Our entire country will rise up toward something better.' As the crowds swelled in a surge of unity, an unprecedented security operation saw more than 5,000 police and soldiers deployed to the streets as France remained on high alert. In December 2013, Ms Thorning-Schmidt was seen taking a selfie with US President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron during Nelson Mandela's memorial service . Ms Thorning-Schmidt and Mr Obama were also seen laughing and chatting during the ceremony, while his wife Michelle looked on, seemingly unimpressed . Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas were also among the leaders attending, as were top representatives of Russia and Ukraine. Rallies also took place in London, Madrid and New York - all previously attacked by al Qaida-linked extremists - as well as Cairo, Sydney, Stockholm, Tokyo and elsewhere. 'We are all Charlie, we are all police, we are all Jews of France,' Prime Minister Manuel Valls had declared, referring to the victims of the attacks that included employees at the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, shoppers at a kosher supermarket and three police officers. The three days of terror began on Wednesday when brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi stormed the newsroom of Charlie Hebdo, killing 12 people. Al Qaida's branch in Yemen said it directed the attack by the masked gunmen to avenge the honour of the Prophet Mohammed, a frequent target of the weekly's satire. The following day an accomplice, Amedy Coulibaly killed a policewoman on the outskirts of Paris and on Friday, the attackers converged. While the Kouachi brothers holed up in a printing plant near Charles de Gaulle airport, Coulibaly seized hostages inside a kosher market. It all ended at dusk Friday with near-simultaneous raids at the printing plant and the market that left all three gunmen dead. Four hostages at the market were also killed. Five people who were held in connection with the attacks were freed late last night, leaving no one in custody, according to the Paris prosecutor's office. The widow of the man who attacked the kosher market is still being sought and was last traced near the Turkey-Syrian border. Earlier, police in Germany detained two men suspected of an arson attack against a newspaper that republished the Charlie Hebdo cartoons. No one was injured in that attack.","Helle Thorning-Schmidt fell on stone steps outside the Elysee Palace .

"Tougher restrictions on ammunition are needed to stop British-based jihadists carrying out Paris-style gun attacks, a former security minister has said. Lord West said the UK’s tough anti-gun laws were a crucial tool in the fight against terror - but demanded further action to tighten restrictions on ammunition. The Labour peer also hit out at the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg for blocking new powers for the security services and urged ministers to increase anti-terror funding. Scroll down for video . Former security minister Admiral Lord West said new powers were needed to tackle Islamist fanatics . Lord West's intervention comes amid warnings from security chiefs that up to 150 jihadists in the UK could carry out gun attacks similar to the Paris atrocities, the Sunday Times reported this morning. Appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr show this morning Lord West said the government’s Communications Data Bill, dubbed a ‘snoopers’ charter’ by opponents, was needed to track terrorist suspects. The bill allows the security services to monitor who people are emailing and what they are looking at online. Lord West said: ‘I think that needs to go through, and I was very irked that it was removed, in fact it was removed by the Deputy Prime Minister, when it had all been agreed across all parties.’ He added that the security services ‘need more money’ to monitor suspected terrorists amid claims that up to 150 fanatics have returned from the war in Syria intent on carrying out attacks at home. The Labour peer’s warning comes after security chiefs warned last week that Britain was being targeted by al-Qaeda terrorists. MI5 chief Andrew Parker said the terror group was plotting spectacular 'mass casualty' attacks on the UK. Lord West (left) was interviewed by the BBC presenter Andrew Marr (centre) alongside the Labour leader Ed Miliband (right) Labour leader Ed Miliband said he was open minded about giving the security services more powers to monitor people's emails . Fanatics wish to emulate 'crude' attacks carried out overseas in recent months. Chillingly, tactics could include a 'hit-and-run' on a crowded public place using a lorry, van or car. Unlike gun or bomb plots, which involves buying weapons or equipment, such an attack would be hard for the security services to detect. At least three plots which would have involved 'certain deaths' in Britain have been foiled in recent months, Mr Parker said. Officials are also keeping tabs on up to 600 British extremists who have travelled to Syria – about 300 of who are now back home. Following the warning, the Chancellor George Osborne said he had handed the security services a new £100million anti-terror fund to track British lone-wolf extremists. Mr Osborne said the cash had been handed over 'in the last few weeks' amid growing fears over the number of radicals returning from Iraq and Syria to wreak terror in Britain. He said the Government would provide MI5 and MI6 with 'all the resources and all the legislation' they need to prevent a terrorist atrocity in Britain. But Mr Parker, the director-general of MI5, said it was almost inevitable that an attack in Britain would succeed sooner or later. He said al-Qaeda was directing British-based fanatics from overseas to carry out attacks on airlines or a Mumbai-style gun and bomb atrocities. In a rare public speech, Mr Parker warned: 'Although we and our partners try our utmost, we know that we cannot hope to stop everything.' Mr Parker's speech, only his second since taking charge in April 2013, warned that the UK was facing a string of 'complex and ambitious plots' against the likes of transport networks and major landmarks. In response to the attack on the Paris-based satirical magazine on Wednesday, Mr Osborne said the threat to the UK was 'severe' – but insisted security chiefs would get whatever they needed. He said: 'It's clearly a big challenge for all countries including Britain and we face a terrorist threat. We have a severe terrorist threat; that is our national state of readiness. 'We have put a huge amount of planning and effort, from the police, from the security services, from the Government into anticipating what might try and happen, stopping some of these attacks and of course we have been successfully doing that over the last year. 'In the last few weeks we have put extra money, over a hundred million pounds into specifically monitoring people who are going to conflicts in Syria and Iraq. 'These sort of self-starting terrorists who get their ideas off the internet and then go and want to perpetrate horrendous crimes, so we are putting a huge effort in. 'As the director general of MI5 said over the last 24 hours, that is the threat we face and we face a threat from more complex plots.' Warning: Andrew Parker (pictured), the director-general of MI5, said it was almost inevitable an attack in Britain would succeed sooner or later . The Chancellor pledged to provide MI5 and MI6 with 'all the resources and all the legislation' they need . Mr Osborne promised that the security services would get 'all the resources and all the legislation' necessary to prevent a terrorist attack in the UK. 'We have got to be vigilant, we have got to have the resources there and my commitment is very clear. This is the national priority. We will put the resources in, whatever the security services need they will get because they do a heroic job on our behalf. 'They often don't get praise, they don't often appear on sofas like this to talk about their work but they are absolutely in the front line with the police dealing with this threat and they will get the support they need and indeed in the last few weeks they have got that support.' 'Our national threat level is severe and that means we assess independently, it is not the politicians who make this assessment but the experts make this assessment, that an attack is highly likely. 'So, we have to be ready for that. We don't have specific intelligence that an attack is imminent or else we would increase the threat level, but we think it is highly likely and we have to be prepared. We have had terrible incidents on our streets.' Mr Osborne's remarks came amid warnings that amid warnings that the threat to Britain was now 'as serious as it has ever been' and the security services needed more powers to monitor fanatics. Former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the chairman of the joint intelligence committee, said the security services must have the power to intercept communications between suspected terrorists in order to prevent future attacks. He said: 'What is emerging in Paris is that the two individuals responsible for the terrible massacre at Charlie Hebdo, may have been linked to Al Qaida in Yemen. 'Now they must have ben communicating with people in the Yemen over the last few days, over the last few weeks. 'The highly important objective is to enable the intelligence agencies in Britain, France and other democracies to be able to get hold of these communications to try and prevent incidents of this kind.'","Lord West said the government should tighten restrictions on ammunition .

"A four-month old baby was kicked off a Disney cruise ship after falling ill after medical staff told her parents that she shouldn't be on the trip anyway because of her age. Jennifer Moak was on a Florida to The Bahamas voyage with her husband Dan and baby as part of a 31-strong group enjoying a holiday for an elder family member with terminal illness. However two days into the trip, Mrs Moak's four-month-old baby fell ill, and was taken to see the ship's doctor. Jennifer Moak, her husband Dan and their four-month-old baby were told to leave the Disney cruise ship . The baby was administered medication, however a couple of hours later the family were contacted my medical staff to be told that the four-month-old would have to be taken off the ship. In the summer, the minimum age of passengers on board Disney Cruises was raised from 12 weeks to six months, however the company said existing bookings would be honoured if the ages didn't fit in with the new rules. The Moaks, from Naples, Florida, claim they were told by medical staff, however, that the decision had been taken because of the baby's age, and that it would be safer to visit a hospital. The family were put up in sub-standard accommodation in Nassau, where the three had to share this bed . Mr and Mrs Moak were allegedly told their four-month-old baby was too young to be on the Disney cruise . Speaking to Naples News, Mrs Moak said: 'He (medical staff) said because of her age, she wasn't supposed to be on the ship and that they would be — I think the word that he used was 'terminating' our stay on the ship.' While the family were confused as to why the baby's age had been raised as a factor despite being told it wouldn't come into play, what followed in terms of a contingency plan from Disney caused them a great deal of distress. Having paid almost £700 ($1,000) a night for the cruise, the family were checked into a hotel in Nassau, that the father described as a 'fleabag motel.' Worryingly the parents were forced take their baby into bed with them as there was nowhere else for the infant to sleep. This came after having to plead for a child car seat on the journey there. After being told they must leave the ship, the standard of provision the Moak's received was not up to scratch . Mrs Moak's father, Dave Berg, who disembarked along with his sick grandaughter added: 'No one can believe that Disney would send a four-month-old baby off into the dark in a foreign country that they say in their brochures is dangerous.' However, Disney refute the suggestion that the child's age was  a reason, telling FoxNews that 'the child was not removed due to her age but because the on-board doctor felt the child needed medical care at a land-based hospital.' After checking in to a Bahamian hospital, the baby was merely diagnosed as having wind, yet the Moaks were left with a £1,200 medical bill. The family added that they have been left upset with Disney's handling of the situation, and are yet to receive an apology. MailOnline Travel have contacted Disney and are awaiting a response.","Jennifer and Dan Moak had booked as part of a 31-strong group .

Meanwhile, George Clooney, who will receive a lifetime achievement award, wore a lapel pin with the same phrase while his wife Amal Alamuddin had her purse customized with the slogan. FILM .

"A woman in the US is suing her former employer because she claims she was discriminated against for being Australian and a woman. Catherine Petzel, a former regional sales manager for red light camera operator Redflex Traffic Systems, alleges in the lawsuit the US company's former president Karen Finley made disparaging remarks about 'the Australians' and their work ethic. This is despite Redflex's parent company, Redflex Holdings Group, being Australian Stock Exchange-listed and headquartered in Melbourne. Catherine Petzel is suing her former employer red light camera operator Redflex Traffic Systems after claiming they sacked her on 'unlawfully discriminatory grounds' in 2012 . Ms Petzel, who was assigned to sell Redflex products in the US states of Ohio and Iowa, is seeking punitive and compensatory damages at a trial in the US District Court because she claims the company sacked her on 'unlawfully discriminatory grounds' in 2012. In court filings, Ms Petzel cites a 2011 Redflex sales conference in the Los Angeles suburb of Culver City. 'Ms Finley referred to the work ethic of Australians, implying that Australians did not work as hard as their counterparts in the United States,' Ms Petzel's lawyer, John Camillus, wrote. 'Ms Petzel felt very embarrassed by Ms Finley's comments.'

This is despite Redflex's parent company, Redflex Holdings Group, being Australian Stock Exchange-listed and headquartered in Melbourne . Ms Finley is also at the centre of a bribery scandal in Chicago that has rocked Redflex's reputation and business in the US, once a major growth area for the company's photo enforcement technology. The 54-year-old has entered not guilty pleas to 16 counts, including mail fraud, bribery and conspiracy to commit bribery counts. She faces more than 20 years' jail if found guilty of the charges. Ms Petzel, in her lawsuit, claims Ms Finley questioned how her Australian accent 'was received' in the US marketplace and expressed concern 'potential customers might view Redflex as being too Australian'. Redflex has asked for Ms Petzel's lawsuit to be dismissed. 'Plaintiff has failed to adduce any direct evidence of gender or national discrimination,' Redflex lawyers wrote in a memorandum to the judge.

"Patient groups have criticised the decision to place the first privately run hospital into special measures – saying it was clear care was improving. Hinchingbrooke Health Care NHS trust, in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, was last week rated ‘inadequate’ by the Care Quality Commission, which gave it the lowest-ever score for care. Hours before the report was published, Circle, the private firm which has run the hospital since February 2012, announced it was pulling out. Special measures: The privately run Hitchingbrooke hospital, Huntingdon, which has been placed into special measures after the Care Quality Commission found serious failings in A&E, among other problems . But local patients said they had seen no problems with care at the organisation. The trust had been hailed as a ‘miracle cure’ for the NHS and received glowing patient surveys and a recent award for ‘best NHS trust for patient care’, from data monitors CHKS. The CQC found serious failings in A&E and warned that food, drink and call bells were left out of patients’ reach, and some were denied pain relief. Circle’s decision and the report are major blows to the Government which is aiming to increase private sector involvement in the NHS to improve services. Some fear there has been a stitch-up by opponents of private enterprise in the NHS. Last night Diane Edwards, of Friends of Hinchingbrooke Hospital, said: ‘It came as a complete surprise because we have seen a lot of improvements at the hospital.’ Alison Watson, of Small Steps which supports children with Down’s Syndrome, said: ‘I’d have liked them to continue … everything was going swimmingly. It just seemed like they were thinking more about us as people rather than numbers going through a system.’ Gordon Dyer, of local charity Acorn Cancer Support Group, said: ‘I don’t know where the issue of standards of care falling has come from because I haven’t noticed it.’ He added: ‘The deal was controversial … [but] as far as I could tell it was being managed well.’ Roger Goss, of pressure group Patient Concern, said: ‘The NHS needs every possible way the service can function to be thoroughly explored because at the moment it is a bottomless pit for taxpayers’ money.’ Patients also expressed concern. Mother-of-three Elli Slyfield, 28, from March, said: ‘I would be gutted if it closes. ‘The communication with the staff was really good, the equipment was brilliant and the facilities were great too.’ Failing: The CQC gave Hitchingbrooke the lowest-ever score for care in a report last week. Circle, the private firm which has run the hospital since February 2012, pulled out hours before the report was published . But Brian Sandover, 80, whose wife died of renal failure in the hospital three days after being admitted last February, criticised the management. An inquest found nurses had left Ann Sandover, 77, without fluids for up to eight hours. Circle is challenging the CQC’s findings and believes it has been judged unfairly. The Mail understands at least one of the 35 inspectors is a member of campaign group Keep Our NHS Public.","Private-sector operator Circle pulled out just before assessment published .

"The devastated father of France’s most wanted woman handed himself in to police, declaring, ‘That is my daughter’, it was revealed last night. Mohamed Boumeddiene went to the authorities just hours after seeing his daughter Hayat’s mugshot on television – released following her husband’s murder of a policewoman and later four hostages in a Parisian deli. Mr Boumeddiene is said to be shocked and heartbroken by his daughter’s alleged involvement in the terror siege. She is thought to have fled France and made her way to Syria. Scroll down for video . Hayat Boumeddiene's father is thought to have told police he knew nothing of his daughter's alleged links with terrorists. The 26-year-old, pictured above with a crossbow, is believed to have fled to Syria . Neighbours say he has since locked himself in his flat, disconnected his phone and has been heard crying and saying: ‘I don’t know if she is dead or alive.’ A friend said: ‘He went to the mosque on Friday to pray and then took himself to the police station after he saw her picture on the television.’ Mr Boumeddiene, a delivery driver, is understood to have told police he had no idea what his daughter was planning and was ‘shocked’. He was questioned but not arrested. Police described Hayat, 26, who has reportedly received terror training, as ‘armed and dangerous’. Her husband Amedy Coulibaly, 32, was part of the same terror cell as the Kouachi brothers – Cherif, 32, and Said, 34 – who killed 12 at the Charlie Hebdo magazine offices. Boumeddiene is believed to have been involved in the planning of the co-ordinated attacks, after phone records revealed she had exchanged more than 500 calls with Cherif’s wife Izzana last year. There were suggestions she had also helped the men gather weapons. As police revealed she may now be in Syria with Islamic State fighters, friends and neighbours shed light on her troubled but devout childhood. Last night, a neighbour who has known the family for more than 20 years, described Mr Boumeddiene’s shock after the photo of Hayat was flashed around the world. Hayat is married to Amedy Coulibaly (right) thought to be responsible for the deaths of a policewoman and several people in a Jewish kosher supermarket in Paris last week . Neighbours of Hayat's father said the 26-year-old had not visited him since the death of her mother, and that her husband was tasked with making their decisions. The couple are pictured on a beach, above . Although estranged for many years, they were said to have had a reconciliation recently. He picked her up from the airport when she returned from a pilgrimage to Mecca last year. ‘Her father has been crying and saying, “I don’t know where she is, I don’t know if my daughter is dead or alive,” said the woman. ‘Her mother wore a head scarf. She was very religious … a proper Muslim woman. She stayed at home and made bread. [Hayat] left 17 or 18 years ago when her mum died … Her father saw her sometimes but she did not visit after he remarried. ‘The new wife is very different – she doesn’t wear a head scarf, she works in a retirement home.’ The neighbour, who did not want to be named, said she believed Hayat’s husband was the driving force, adding: ‘She left here with that man. He did everything and then it all came down on her. He was the mastermind.’ A friend who goes to the same Al Islah mosque as Mr Boumeddiene said he had not attended the mosque since his daughter’s links to the terror plot were revealed. Born in Villiers-sur-Marne, a suburb nine miles east of Paris, Boumeddiene grew up in a small flat in a run-down part of the town – where her father still lives. Her mother died suddenly when she was six. It is understood her father struggled to cope after his wife’s death and the younger of his seven children, including Hayat, were taken into care. Coulibaly was killed last week as French police stormed the kosher supermarket where he was holding hostages. The 32-year-old jihadi admitted in a pre-recorded video he had been working alongisde the Kouachi brothers, responsible for carrying out the massacre against Charlie Hebdo offices . Coulibaly is said to have met Cherif Kouachi between 2005 and 2006 while in a French prison. The men's wives exchanged hundreds of phone calls last year . She is believed to have met Coulibaly in Juvisy-sur-Orge, south-east of Paris, while working as a cashier. He first came to the attention of police as a teenager and was later convicted of a string of drug and theft offences. The couple lived in a flat in Bagneux, a poor suburb of Paris, where neighbours this week described them as ‘quiet and normal’. They said they enjoyed holidays together, and were pictured embracing on a beach, Boumeddiene in a bikini. Coulibaly is said to have met Cherif Kouachi between 2005 and 2006 while in Fleury-Merogis prison, south of Paris. Meanwhile, Boumeddiene became more devout, wearing traditional Islamic dress. She reportedly lost her job because she refused to take off her veil. The couple married in a religious ceremony in 2009, though this is not legally recognised. When Boumeddiene was interviewed in 2010 by counter-terrorism officers over Coulibaly’s involvement in a bid to free bomber Smain Ait Ali Belkacem from jail, she refused to condemn Al-Qaeda attacks. It was initially thought she was at the Jewish deli attack. But police said she was seen by Turkish authorities crossing into Syria on January 8, the day Coulibaly killed a trainee policewoman. Cherif Kouachi’s wife was released from police custody yesterday, after being arrested in connection with his attacks. She released a statement condemning the atrocities, claiming she had no idea of his plans.","Hayat Boumeddiene is most wanted woman in France after terror attacks .

"A coyote spotted roaming around a Manhattan park was captured after cops shot it with tranquilizer darts. The animal was spotted on the Upper West Side in Riverside Park by a woman at 9:30pm who called police. When authorities arrived the animal sprinted off - leaving officers to run after it. Cops have caught a coyote trapped in a Manhattan basketball court on Saturday night.  It took officers an hour-and-a-half to capture the black and white animal - she was hit by two tranquilizer darts . 'It's been running back and forth from 72nd and 79th streets and Riverside Drive,' said one officer to the New York Post. 'We're just trying not to hurt the little guy.' It took officers an hour-and-a-half to capture the animal - she was hit by two tranquilizer darts. The NYPD 24th Precinct updated its followers on Twitter about the progress of the capture . The NYPD 24th Precinct updated its followers on Twitter and tweeted: Sorry for the delay-took a while. Had it corralled inside fenced-in BB court, but so cold out, the tranquilizer in the darts kept freezing! It then added: 'NYPD Emergency Services did a great job & the coyote is unharmed (although now she is a little sleepy). The question is: What to name her?' The animal will eventually be released back into the wild. There have been an increased number of sighting of coyotes in New York in recent year -in June a coyote was found dead in the Bronx. The animals have adapted to living in close quarters with humans and have learned to navigate tasks associated with built-up areas - such as crossing busy roads and avoiding cars. Over the past few years they have spread to nearly every corner of the United States - wreaking havoc by preying on domestic pets and even attacking children. They are strictly nocturnal, curling up in a ball during the day just yards from where people walk, and are able to defend large settlement areas. In December police in Northern California shot and killed a wild coyote after it bit a man and a child and tried to attack a third person in separate attacks in residential neighborhoods on Christmas. The animal was spotted on the Upper West Side in Riverside Park (pictured) by a woman at 9:30pm who called police (file photo) Police shot and killed the animal after it bit the 42-year-old man and the 5-year-old boy on separate streets nearly a mile apart. Police say the attacks started when the coyote quietly approached the man and bit his leg as he was walking to his car with his children. The man ran with his children to a house and the coyote followed them, but he got everyone inside and shut the door before the coyote could get in, police said. The coyote left the area after several minutes, and officers searched but couldn't find it. Less than an hour later, a runner more than half a mile away said he was chased by what he described as a wolf. He kicked off the animal and wasn't hurt. Officers were later told that a child in the same area was bitten on the leg. The boy's father ran to his aid and tried to scare the animal away.","The animal was spotted on the Upper West Side in Riverside Park .

"Former 'emir' of the Buttes Chaumont cell: Farid Benyettou (pictured) has been working at the Pitie-Salpetrier Hospital in Paris since December . The man who allegedly radicalised the Kouachi brothers involved in the Paris terror attacks is now a nursing intern in the accident and emergency unit of the hospital where victims of the Charlie Hebdo shootings were taken. In an extraordinary twist, Farid Benyettou, 32, the former ‘emir’ of the Buttes Chaumont cell, has been working at the Pitie-Salpetrier Hospital in Paris since December. He was an inflammatory figure of the 19th arrondissement and the Adda’wa mosque and known for his radical preaching of Islam. According to Le Parisien, Benyettou, also linked to the Salafist Group for Preaching Combat, met the brothers in the early 2000s. He urged his followers to wage jihad in Iraq. In 2005 he was indicted for ‘criminal association in relation to a terrorist enterprise’ and sentenced with Cherif Kouachi to six years in prison three years later. During Cherif’s questioning in 2005 he said that from the Koranic courses taught by his mentor, he ‘really felt the truth was there before me when he spoke’. Released from prison in 2011, Benyettou started nursing training a year later before joining the A&E unit at the Pitie-Salpetriere. He has been described as ‘a studious and discreet student.’ Le Parisien claims that in the heightened atmosphere of the shootings and the tenseness surrounding the city, hospital management removed the on-call schedules from view. Pitie-Salpetrier Hospital: Released from prison in 2011, Benyettou started nursing training a year later before joining the A&E unit at the Pitie-Salpetriere (pictured) Cherif and Said: Benyettou, also linked to the Salafist Group for Preaching Combat, met the Kouachi brothers in the early 2000s . But the paper claims that Benyettou, although not on call Wednesday or Thursday, had to be present on the night of Friday to Saturday - and the following two days. A doctor is said to have told the publication: ‘It’s unimaginable that this man, one of the main mentors of the Kouachi brothers, could welcome the victims of his former protégés. ‘And I cannot imagine that the hospital were unaware of his past.’ Another colleague said it was not possible, according to the rules of the country’s health department, for a nursing position to be held by someone with a criminal record. A hospital spokesman said a criminal record does not prohibit anyone from taking a diploma, as it is of value in many other public institutions. Tonight an executive for Paris Hospitals admitted Benyettou was taken off the rota following Thursday shootings. Martin Hirsch said today: 'When we learned of the Thursday shootings we contacted the police to ensure they knew the position and had M Benyettou on their radar. 'I made the decision Friday morning that he was not on the duta roster.' He added that the nursing training school which took him on and comes under the auspices of the Paris Hospitals board , were aware from the start of his convictions. Benyettou, he said, had already completed 80 per cent of his training and would be relieved of any hospital duties. Instead he will spend the last few days gaining his diploma purely within a school setting.","Farid Benyettou, 32, is the former 'emir' of the Buttes Chaumont cell .

"Tears: Emilie Cunliffe, 16, is comforted by mum Kym Marsh . For the thousands of people who apply to take part on reality TV show The Voice, the show offers the chance of living their dream. But for two teenagers who appeared on the first episode of the new series, the experience must have been closer to a nightmare after they were humiliated by the judges in front of millions of viewers. Campaigners have now questioned whether it is appropriate for such young people to be exposed to the stresses and disappointments of reality television. The fourth season of The Voice began on BBC1 on Saturday with new judge Rita Ora and attracted 8million viewers, the biggest audience for the opening episode of any of its series so far. Out of the ten singers to appear on the show, performing out of sight of Ora and her fellow judges Sir Tom Jones, will.i.am and Ricky Wilson, three were under the age of 18, two as young as 16. Both of the 16-year-olds were sent home by the judges, one being left weeping by the end of her audition. Judges were criticised for their actions on social media, particularly during the audition of Stephen McLaughlin, as they could be seen repeatedly questioning whether he was male or female and then laughed when he was eventually revealed as a man. Vivienne Pattison, of Media Watch UK, last night warned parents to exercise more responsibility and think hard before allowing their child to take part in a talent show. She also called for psychologists to be drafted in to decide an appropriate age-limit before people were allowed to enter. Those auditioning must be at least 16 to take part in The Voice, while for The X Factor, those as young as 14 can compete. One of the contestants on Saturday’s episode was Emilie Cunliffe, the 16-year-old daughter of former Hear’Say singer Kym Marsh, who found her own fame through a television talent contest, Popstars. Emilie said she had been determined to get onto the show and saw it as a way of following in her mother’s footsteps. Laughter: Ricky Wilson, left, sniggers during Stephen McLaughlin's audition . She sang Clairty by Zedd but was not chosen by any of the judges for their teams. She was left in tears by the rejection and needed her mother to meet her in the hallway to console her. The teenager later tweeted: ‘I will never give up, I’m determined to make my dream come true.’ Rejected: Stephen McLaughlin . Pippa Smith, the former co-chair of Safermedia, said in a personal capacity: ‘It’s not appropriate for people who have not reached full maturity to appear on these shows. The programmes will probably say they have permission from the parents but people are star struck by everything to do with television, so parents think it’s so exciting and cool. ‘From being a parent myself I would think going on such a show and being rejected could cause quite long-lasting damage and problems with self-esteem and take them a long while to pick up from that. You also never know how they are going to be treated by their peers at school, some might be kind but some might be very kind and will social media now, anyone can make adverse comments. ‘Producers will say they have taken an awful lot of care but it’s so individual with children and if they haven’t been through that experience themselves they can’t know how they are going to be impacted, so it’s a real gamble really.’ Vivienne Pattison, of Media Watch UK, added: ‘As a parent, if you have a child who you think might not cope, you have to think very carefully about whether you let them do that. I think it’s important for these programme have a clear and defined age policy and I would support it if they decided they weren’t going to take people under 18. There was hype around former Hear’Say singer's daughter, but her performance proved to be painfully dull . ‘If they do, that’s fine but they have a duty of care to these children and they have to keep that in mind as they are putting the programmes together and make them as pain free as possible. I certainly think it would be useful to get some input from psychologists to find out what age they think it is appropriate.’ The judges also received criticism on Twitter for their behaviour during the audition of Stephen, with audiences able to see them giggling and arguing whether it was a man or woman singing. After none of them turned to the singer, meaning the contestant would not go through to the next round, their chairs automatically span round and, on seeing it was a man, Ora burst into laughter and said she had known it was a man. One viewer tweeted: ‘Lmao [laugh my a** off] at Rita just questioning the gender of an innocent 16 year old and laughing on his face right after no one turned around.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘The BBC takes the duty of care of all contestants very seriously. Viewers of The Voice can see it’s a caring environment and we ensure younger contestants who audition for the show are fully aware of the format and have family or guardians with them at all stages.’ The judges also received criticism on Twitter for their behaviour during the audition of Stephen .

"Matt Lauer is denying claims that he had an affair with celebrity chef Giada De Laurentis. The married Today show host said he never had a sexual relationship with the 44-year-old and says their long-term friendship is why they have been recently spotted together. He hit out at allegations that he was one of the reasons why the celebrity chef had recently split from her husband. De Laurentis also denies the claim. Speaking to TMZ following his arrival at LAX on Saturday, he said: 'There is no truth to that story.' 'From the horse's mouth we have been friends for 10 years and more importantly I feel bad for what she has been going through.' De Laurentiis recently announced her split from husband Todd Thompson after 11 years of marriage last week - but she denied it was because of Lauer. Strictly platonic: Matt Lauer has denied ever having an affair with celebrity chef Giada De Laurentis saying they have been 'friends for 10 years' Sympathy: The Today show host, pictured cooking with the celebrity chef, says he 'feels bad' for De Laurentis following the split from her husband of 11 years . Lauer has been married to Annette Roque, his second wife, since 1998. The Dutch former model is the mother of his three children . Then there were also rumors concerning fellow chef Bobby Flay, after the pair were seen dining together in New York just days before the 44-year-old Food Network star announced her breakup at the end of December. However Giada has now said any suggestions of romance involving the two - which first surfaced in Star magazine - were false. 'My long-time friendships with my co-workers Matt Lauer and Bobby Flay are exactly that — long-time friendships,' she said in a statement to website Gossip Cop. 'There has never been a romantic relationship with these two men,' she added. Giada and her husband, fashion designer Todd Thompson, separated in July but only announced the split last week. The couple have a six-year-old daughter, Jade. Their separation comes three years after Giada was forced to deny claims she had been cheating on Todd with musician John Mayer, 37. Lauer took to the red carpet at the Golden Gloves with Today show co-cost Savannah Guthrie at the Beverly Hilton Hotel . Denial: Three years before announcing her split from husband Todd Thompson, Giada De Laurentiis was forced to deny claims she had hooked up with John Mayer . Speaking to Redbook magazine about the claims in 2011, Giada called it unexpected and insisted nothing had happened with the Your Body Is A Wonderland singer. Star magazine reported that the duo had a 'steamy hookup' at the Gansevoort Hotel in New York, in 2010 but Giada revealed her husband was actually in New York with her when she was alleged to have been with John. And she revealed Todd's embarrassment that his family in Michigan might believe it was true. She told Redbook: 'I was shocked. And not so much for me, but for my husband and family. My family is used to that sort of thing. But my husband's family is not. Todd was embarrassed that his family in Michigan would see it and think, What is going on over there in Hollywood?' Giada admitted she had met John in the past but insisted it was nothing more than a brief introduction and she hadn't seen him in three years before the alleged fling took place. John's rep also told E! News: 'The claims are absolutely ridiculous.' Giada's representative told MailOnline on Wednesday: 'She barely knows John Mayer. She met him at an event and chatted with him for about five minutes and that is the extent of her contact with him.' Separate paths: Giada and Todd, shown in February in New York City, separated back in July . The chef and Todd appear to be having an amicable split, with Giada writing on Facebook: 'After an amicable separation since July, Todd and I have decided to end our marriage. Although our decision to separate comes with a great deal of sadness, our focus on the future and overwhelming desire for our family's happiness has given us the strength to move forward on separate, yet always connected paths. 'Todd and I share a beautiful daughter and a lifetime of great memories that we both treasure more than anything. We are so thankful for our friends and family, and really appreciate the support in this time of change,' she added. The statement did not mention if divorce proceedings had started.

The woman, aged in her 40s, was walking her dog along the foreshore path at Sandringham in Melbourne's southeast at 7.30pm on January 3 when she was approached by a man wearing a towel around his waist.

The man is perceived to be of southern European appearance, aged between 40-50 years old, about 172cm tall with a medium build, bald head and wearing a number of necklaces including a cross. Moorabbin acting detective inspector Brad Daly praised the victim's brave efforts of taking a photo during the alleged attack. 'It's pretty daunting but she's managed to get it - obviously that's not the full photo - it's been really valuable to us,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Inspector Daly said it was common for indecent exposure incidents to occur along the beachfront but not typical for indecent assaults to happen in the area. 'We probably get about one willful and indecent exposure incident a month in summer but it gets quieter in the colder months,' he said. 'There is quite often someone doing the wrong thing like that but it's different for it to escalate to an indecent assault.'

"Several mysterious booms have shaken central Oklahoma, rattling windows and spooking livestock, and officials say they don't yet have answers for what is causing the deafening noises. Oklahoma Geological Survey research seismologist Austin Holland said a series of booms, much like a sonic boom, rattled the Norman area starting at 11:19 a.m. Friday. Similar booms had been reported Thursday in the same area, along with other surrounding towns, though Friday's booms weren't 'quite as frequent' as Thursday's, according to Holland. Scroll down for video . Boom: Deafening noises have mysteriously occurred through central Oklahoma, rattling windows and spooking livestock on Thursday and Friday . The windows of Anthony Young's home on the outskirts of Oklahoma City rattled. 'We thought some nut was out here, you know, with explosives,' Young told KOCO-TV. 'It sounded like thunder, you could feel the ground shake, but it was nothing like an earthquake,' Young said. US Geological Survey officials said two earthquakes struck the area on Friday, a half-hour before the booms began, though they said the booms were not likely aftershocks, according to KOCO-TV. Both Holland and National Weather Service meteorologist Matthew Day didn't have an explanation for the booms. Holland said it's unlikely that it's due to a drilling process known as fracking because the booms were heard and felt over a wide area including Norman, Edmond and Shawnee. Day, who's based in Norman, said a phenomenon known as cryoseisms also isn't likely. Cryoseisms, or 'frost quakes,' occur when water quickly freezes in soil or rock, then expands and cracks. Rattled: The windows of Norman resident Anthony Young's home rattled Friday, causing him to think at first that it was some 'nut' with explosives . 'There are some stories going around that's what it was, but based on the research we've done here, it doesn't appear what people heard is related to the cryoseism phenomena,' Day told The Norman Transcript. 'There's not enough moisture, and the temperatures are not cold enough. That happens in areas where you have a lot of water flowing through a lot of rock,' Day said. 'We don't know what it was, we just know what it is not,' according to Day. Holland said the booms occurred on generally regular interval, initially occurring 40 to 60 seconds apart, then about 20 seconds apart. 'It's a mystery to us as well,' he said. 'It's quite interesting.'","Earthquakes occurred about a half-hour before loud booms rattled Oklahoma Friday, though officials say the booms are not likely aftershocks .

"Sightings of her date back to the sixth century and even in modern times, a glimpse of her still makes waves around the world. But it seems Nessie is not the first monster to grace Scottish waters after it emerged a long-lost relative may have been discovered. This monster lived 170 million years ago, not in Loch Ness, but in a warm shallow sea around what is now the Isle of Skye and has been identified as a new species of 'ichthyosaur,' a large dolphin-like marine reptile that grew up to 14 feet long from snout to tail. Scroll down for video . The 'ichthyosaur' was a large dolphin-like marine reptile that grew up to 14 feet long from snout to tail . A team of palaeontologists - led by the University of Edinburgh and including a consortium of Scottish institutions - studied fossil fragments of skulls, teeth, vertebrae and an upper arm bone discovered on Skye in the past 50 years. Several of the fossils came from ichthyosaurs, including one previously unknown species, named 'Dearcmhara shawcrossi.' Dearcmhara, pronounced 'jarkvara', is Scottish Gaelic for marine lizard. The name shawcrossi was chosen in honour of amateur fossil hunter Brian Shawcross, who found the creature's remains on Skye's Bearreraig Bay in 1959. Throughout the Jurassic Period, much of Skye was under water. At the time, it was joined to the rest of the UK and part of a large island positioned between landmasses that drifted apart to become Europe and North America. Lead researcher Dr Steve Brusatte, from the University of Edinburgh's School of Geosciences, said: 'During the time of dinosaurs, the waters of Scotland were prowled by big reptiles the size of motor boats. Skye, above, is one of the few places in the world where fossils from the Middle Jurassic Period can be found . 'Their fossils are very rare, and only now, for the first time, we've found a new species that was uniquely Scottish. 'Without the generosity of the collector who donated the bones to a museum instead of keeping them or selling them, we would have never known that this amazing animal existed. We are honoured to name the new species after Mr Shawcross and will do the same if any other collectors wish to donate new specimens.' A description of the creature appears in a study in the Scottish Journal of Geology. Skye is one of the few places in the world where fossils from the Middle Jurassic Period can be found and scientists believe discoveries made there could provide valuable insights into how marine reptiles evolved. Dr Nick Fraser, from National Museums Scotland, said: 'Not only is this a very special discovery, but it also marks the beginning of a major new collaboration involving some of the most eminent palaeontologists in Scotland. The real Nessie? This famous picture appearing to show a creature rising from the water of Loch Ness was taken by Dr Kenneth Wilson in 1934 . 'It has brought together key organisations, local collectors on Skye and specialists from further afield. 'We are excited by the programme of work and are already working on additional new finds. This is a rich heritage for Scotland.' The work was carried out by a consortium involving the University of Edinburgh, National Museums Scotland, the University of Glasgow's Hunterian Museum, Scottish National Heritage and Staffin Museum, Isle of Skye. Members of the research team, known as PalAlba, will be exhibiting the bones of Dearcmhara at a one-day fossil event at Our Dynamic Earth in Edinburgh on Sunday, 18 January from 10am-4pm. St Columba was reported to have seen Nessie when preaching by the River Ness in the sixth century, but the first modern sighting of her was in 1933, when a man called George Spicer and his wife saw 'a most extraordinary form of animal' cross the road in front of their car.","Palaeontologists studied fossil fragments found on Skye over last 50 years .

"Kim Jong-Un could be set to open a state-backed restaurant in Scotland serving North Korean delicacies such as dog meat soup and pine-nut gruel. The dictator, who has also opened a diner in Amsterdam, is believed to be interested in opening another in the UK. Experts say that Kim is especially keen on opening the restaurant in Scotland due to his love of whisky and its popularity among the communist ruling elite. Scroll down for video . The North Korean leader, pictured, is reportedly keen on opening a restaurant in Scotland offering traditional dishes native to his country . The 'Pyongyang' chain of restaurants already has branches in China and Asia, with proceeds from the business being funnelled back into North Korea to help prop up the secretive regime. Michael Madden, editor of North Korea Leadership Watch, said the country is desperate to build diplomatic ties with European countries, especially those with left-wing leanings. He explained: 'It would not surprise me at all if they opted to open a restaurant in Scotland. 'The Scottish independence referendum catapulted Scotland into the North Korean's elite's thoughts. 'Despite voting no they'd consider left-leaning Scotland to be more suitable than England, plus North Koreans love whisky. 'Tourists in North Korea are told to tip people in Scotch instead of the currency.' Kim Jong Un pictured visiting a mushroom farm in Pyongyang in a picture released last week. As well as a love for whisky, the North Korean leader is reportedly hooked on Swiss cheese . The Pyongyang restaurants are run in partnership with Office 39, a secretive branch of the North Korean government, which uses them as a legal way of raising overseas cash. Mr Madden, a frequent visitor to North Korea, added: 'They are one of the few ways to experience North Korean culture without having to go there. 'They are done like a franchise with the state renting the brand out to other Koreans to run.' Fellow expert Jenny Town, of the US-Korea Institute, said she too believed Pyongyang had warmed to Scotland in recent months. Cold noodles . Barbecued cuttlefish . Kimchi - a side dish of vegetables with a variety of seasonings . Dog meat soup . Pine-nut gruel . Gingseng wine . She added: 'North Korea is going to support any country struggling for independence and legitimacy, as North Korea itself still continues to seek validation and recognition of its own legitimacy as a sovereign nation.' The state-run food outlets - which began springing up about 10 years ago - channel up to 30 per cent of takings back to Pyongyang. But some critics fear the cash ends up in Jong-Un’s own pockets to fund his lifestyle. As well as a love for whisky, the North Korean leader is reportedly hooked on Swiss cheese. It’s claimed he imports vast quantities at huge expense - despite millions of his countrymen being malnourished. A unhealthy appetite for Emmental is believed to be a key factor in Kim's weight ballooning so much that he now walks with a limp. The North Korean Embassy in London did not respond to requests for a comment.","North Korean leader said to be interested in opening restaurant in Scotland .

"The 31-stone man claiming he is 'too fat to work' would use his ex-wife's credit card to pay for hotel rooms where he would meet his mistresses, it has been revealed . Steve Beer's jaw-dropping  boasting of how the £1,700-a-week benefits he and sixth wife, Michelle, receive paid for their wedding, was just the tip of the iceberg. Today, the 45-year-old's fifth wife has told how she would wash and care for the morbidly obese benefits-claimant, only for him to cheat on her using her money to pay for stays in B&Bs. The family of Stephen Beer - who appeared with latest wife Michelle Coombe on a Channel 5 documentary earlier this week - have revealed the emotional trail of destruction he has left behind him . Mr Beer cheated on his fifth wive Lynn Kirby, pictured with Mr Beer on Jeremy Kyle in 2011 and was discovered when she found that he has used her credit card to pay for B&B trysts with now-wife Michelle . Mr Beer, from Plymouth, Devon, married his fifth wife Lynn Kirby in 2002, and it was she who cared for him, washed his huge body and helped him to the toilet before he got his £8,000-a-year carer. The pair were together for ten years but split after Ms Kirby discovered that he was cheating on her with his current wife, Michelle, 43, when she checked her credit card bills. 'He would go to B&Bs and spend 60 quid on my card to pay for it,' she told The Mirror. 'I had to help him get on the toilet and wash his legs three times a day. All the time he was having and affair. 'He wasn't just cheating on me with Michelle, he was cheating on me with two other women as well and he will to the same to her.' Mr Beer, pictured with latest wife Michelle, has been slammed by his second wife, Alison Symons, and her children  for his treatment of them . Host Jeremy Kyle looks on in despair as Mr Beer explains his actions to wife No.5, Lynn Kirby, left, and then-mistress-now-wife No. 6, Michelle, right . Love rat: Steve Beer, 45, has been revealed as a serial cheater who is accused of being unfaithful to his third, fourth and fifth wife . Despite running his own contract-cleaning business until he suffered a stroke in 2008, Ms Kirby claims Mr Beer lived off her wages throughout their relationship and left her bankrupt and £15,000 in debt. 'He never brought any money into the home, he even used to call into places where I was cleaning and take my wage,' Ms Kirby told The Express. 'All he would do was sit in front of the TV and demand I fetch food and beer for him. He treated me as a servant.' It is believed Mr Beer has made two emotionally-charged appearances on the Jeremy Kyle show. The first was in 2011, when he made an appearance with Lynn and Michelle, in a segment entitled: 'I'm your husband's mistress and I'll prove I'm not cheating on him.' He reportedly admitted he failed a lie detector test regarding his affair and at times shouted at host Jeremy Kyle, repeating that 'we all make mistakes'. Mr Beer has had a long history of being unfaithful to his partners, marrying more than a handful of times since the 80s. He married his second wife, Alison Symons, in 1989, having split from first partner, Eileen Mitchell. But he and Ms Symons separated three years later, leaving her with their two children, Sarah and Matty, who were then both less than two years old. The 31-stone lothario then married a woman named Margaret, but this did not stop him from going after another woman, Fiona Burt. Mr Beer, pictured during one of his two appearances on the Jeremy Kyle show in 2011 . He was filmed by the makers of Benefits: Too Fat To Work, a Channel 5 documentary about benefit claimants who claim their weight prevents them from working, which was aired earlier this week . Ms Burt, 46, who later became his common-law wife, says Mr Beer had claimed he was single when they 'met' on a phone dating chatroom in 1999, but was in fact still married and living with Margaret in Newcastle. Mr Beer's son, Matty Symons. said he and his biological father appeared on the show last year, when a paternity test proved he was his father. But, his son said, 'he still didn't want anything to do with me'. Both Matty and his sister Sarah, who are now in their twenties, this week told The Sun they are 'ashamed' of their biological father's benefits-funded lifestyle and treat their mother's new partner, Steve Symons, as their real father. In March 2009, Mr Beer, who then ran a contract cleaning firm, was involved in a botched bid to take over non-league Weymouth FC. He had hoped to save the then-financially embattled south coast club, but pulled out of a planned deal at the last minute after getting 'cold feet' and suffering a minor stroke. The club's director Ian Winsor said at the time: 'Mr Beer clearly got cold feet. He did have a bit of money and being a major football fan he thought he could help the club. 'However, he has spent too long in Weymouth and, through speaking to people, heard so much bitterness he got scared.' Mr Beer can't stand up for more than a few minutes at a time and relies on a council carer to get washed . Producers followed them as they organised the ceremony - including canapes and a buffet provided by their favourite kebab shop . Despite being jobless and on a weight management course, the couple can be seen treating themselves to kebabs after they went to a weigh in and realised they had lost a few pounds. The takeaway cost almost £12 . One of the club's players later commented that a meeting with Mr Beer seemed to be the first time the 'prospective owner' had eaten in a restaurant, as he asked for explanations of dishes on the menu. At one pointed in the doomed deal, Mr Beer reportedly produced a cheque for £300,000 that contained spelling mistakes and had Tipp-Ex marks on it. The revelations came after Mr Beer, 45, caused outrage this week when he appeared on Channel 5 documentary Benefits: Too Fat To Work, in which he told of his £3,000 taxpayer-funded wedding to Michelle, 43. The couple's big day – which saw £1,000 spent on catering, including £450 for their favourite kebab takeaway for the evening buffet – was paid for almost entirely from benefits. Mr Beer, who  weighs 31st, had to have a suit specially made for the occasion. By contrast his 23st wife became a bride for the first time and wore a white gown for the register office ceremony and church blessing that followed. Their 50 guests were treated to a three-course meal at the reception, followed later by the buffet. Viewers were shown how paramedics were called to the reception in Plymouth, Devon, before Mr Beer was taken to hospital feeling unwell. Mr Beer, who suffers from type 2 diabetes, hypertension and other problems linked to his weight, had a blood clot on the lung and instead of a honeymoon he spent nine days in hospital. He can only stand for a limited period before becoming breathless and his wife said the wedding day trip to hospital was no surprise. Mrs Beer, who has not had a job during her adult life, said: 'I reckon Stephen will be on benefits for most of his life.' He also told host Phillip Schofield that he did not always eat kebabs, and that off camera he and his wife were eating 'healthy food' Mr Beer used to run a cleaning business and had to give up work six years ago following a stroke. Interviewed about his benefits on the documentary, he said: 'Is it right? Of course not. But at the end of the day I did work. I have worked, I haven't sat on my a*** all the time. I have done some work and so really, why not?' The couple receive around £1,700 a month in benefits. The rent on their one-bedroom flat is paid for by the taxpayer, and a carer comes twice daily to clean and help Mr Beer dress, but the taxpayer pays the £8,000-a-year cost. Mr Beer also uses a specially strengthened mobility scooter, provided at public expense. He insists he wants a job but says no one will give him work because of his weight. He blamed the Government for being too generous to those on benefits. Speaking on ITV's This Morning programme, Mr Beer said: 'The Government is making it easy for people like us. The Government is making it easy for people on benefits.' He said he didn't think he deserved anything, adding: 'I'm the one who put myself in this situation, no one else.' However, he insisted he was now suffering from 'prejudice'. He said he recently applied for an office job but claims he was turned down because he was too overweight. It is believed the couple are currently at a 'boot camp' to lose weight.","Steve Beer was on TV this week telling of his benefits-funded wedding .

"More than three decades after she went to war with Argentina over the islands, a statue of Margaret Thatcher has been unveiled on the Falklands. The bronze tribute to the former Prime Minister, who oversaw Britain's victory in the 1982 conflict, was formally revealed in the islands' capital Stanley yesterday.

More than three decades after she went to war with Argentina over the islands, a statue of Margaret Thatcher has been unveiled on the Falklands . The bronze tribute to the former Prime Minister, who oversaw Britain's victory in the 1982 conflict, was formally revealed in the islands' capital Stanley yesterday by her son, Sir Mark Thatcher (right) The overwhelming response was for a statue which was unveiled at a ceremony on the islands' Margaret Thatcher Day by her son, Sir Mark Thatcher. Falklands-based sculptor Steve Masson was commissioned to carry out the work which cost around £40,000 and stands eight foot high on a stone plinth. The bronze statue bears a plaque with a quote from Baroness Thatcher from April 3, 1982 when she said: ‘They are few in number, but they have the right to live in peace, to choose their own way of life and determine their own allegiance.’ The bust has been positioned at the end of Thatcher Drive, next to the Liberation Monument, which honours 255 UK servicemen and three Falklands civilians who died in the conflict. Falklands-based sculptor Steve Masson was commissioned to carry out the work which cost around £40,000 and stands eight foot high on a stone plinth. The statue bears a plaque with a quote from Baroness Thatcher, which reads: 'They are few in number, but they have the right to live in peace, to choose their own way of life and determine their own allegiance' But the sculpture of Baroness Thatcher has sparked a new row between Britain and Argentina, with the South American country's London ambassador condemning the statue 'in our Malvinas Islands' as a provocative move, saying: 'What the UK is doing is celebrating war.' Her anger was echoed by veterans' leader Mario Volpe in Buenos Aires. He said: 'The statue is not a symbol of democracy. It's her fault so many died.' He said Baroness Thatcher 'could have avoided the war and the deaths'. About 650 Argentine personnel also died in the two-month long conflict, and three Falkland Islanders lost their lives. CCTV will provide 24-hour surveillance around the 'Iron Lady' to prevent it being defaced by those who contest UK sovereignty. Following Baroness Thatcher's death in 2013, the population of the Falkland Islands were consulted about how they wished to commemorate the leader, and chose to put up a statue . But the sculpture of Baroness Thatcher has sparked a new row between Britain and Argentina, with the South American country's London ambassador condemning the statue 'in our Malvinas Islands' as provocative . Artist Stephen Massam said: 'The bust is not meant as a provocation, it is meant to honour the role Mrs Thatcher played in liberating the islands, which are British to their core. We're delighted to welcome her home.' Mr Massam believes the bust will become a tourist attraction, adding: 'She is an integral part of the islands' history and it is entirely appropriate that her image will gaze down on visitors and that she will remain in the Falklands for ever.' The row is the latest in a recent series of flare-ups between Argentina and Britain. Earlier this year, Jeremy Clarkson and his Top Gear team were forced to flee Argentina during filming of the show's Christmas special, which aired on the BBC last month. An angry mob took offence at the 'H982FKL' number plate on Clarkson's Porsche 928GT, which some interpreted as a Falklands reference, but the production team maintain was a coincidence. In July, Argentina's football chiefs were fined £19,500 by FIFA after their players posed with a political banner laying claim to the Falkland Islands. The players stood behind the slogan ‘Las Malvinas son Argentinas’ (the Falklands are Argentinian) at a June 7 friendly against Slovenia in Buenos Aires. Waged over the course of ten weeks, the Falklands War was sparked when Argentina invaded remote British territories in the South Atlantic on April 2 1982 in an attempt to establish the sovereignty it had long claimed over them. Agentina, which refers to the islands as Las Malvinas, had claimed it had inherited them from Spain during the 1800s. The invasion prompted the UK, which had ruled the islands for 150 years to retaliate, a task force to reclaim the Falklands, with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher saying the 1,800 Falklanders were 'of British tradition and stock'. Margaret Thatcher with a painting depicting the Falklands conflict. The war lasted 74 days and claimed the lives of 255 British military personnel, 649 Argentinians and three Falkland Islanders . Britain declared a 200-mile exclusion zone around the islands, and warned that any vessel or aircraft entering this would face being fired at. Some 28,000 troops and more than 100 ships were deployed, with the ensuing war lasting for 74 days, claiming the lives of 255 British military personnel, 649 Argentinians and three Falkland Islanders. The first major loss of life came on May 2, when Argentine cruiser, General Belgrano was sunk, with the loss of 368 crew members. Just two days later British destroyer, HMS Sheffield was struck with an Exocet missile, causing it to sink. Of those on board, 20 were killed. On May 21, 3,000 British troops landed at the San Carlos settlement in East Falkland, bringing ashore 1,000 tons of supplies to establish a beachhead, with the plan being to launch attacks on there on Goose Green and Stanley. On May 28, troops from 2 Para 2  attacked Goose Green and Darwin, with fighting lasting through the night and into the following day. The British troops were hugely outnumbered but ultimately successful. A total of 17 British and 47 Argentine soldiers were killed, and 961 Argentine troops were taken prisoner. The victory meant that British forces were then able to march towards Stanley, mounting a final attack on Argentine troops before liberating the town on June 14. Dispute over who should have the islands has continued in the decades since, but in referendum in March 2013, which produced a 92 per cent turn out, 1,513 islanders vote to retain their status as British overseas territory, with just three voting against.","Bronze sculpture of former Prime Minister unveiled in Stanley by her son .

"People who fear they have cancer will be able to bypass their GP and refer themselves for tests, in an effort to save an extra 8,000 lives a year. Other plans for speeding up diagnosis include lowering the bar for referrals and allowing family doctors to send patients straight for scans without them seeing a consultant first. More than 60 hospitals in England will run pilot schemes aimed at improving cancer survival rates by catching the disease earlier. Speeding up diagnosis: People who fear they have cancer will be able to bypass their GP and refer themselves for tests, in an effort to save an extra 8,000 lives a year . NHS England says that increasing the number of tumours caught early by even 10 per cent would save 8,000 lives a year. Better diagnosis would also reduce pressure on A&E units, which currently spot up to a quarter of cases of the disease. David Cameron said Britain ‘must never rest’ in its determination to beat cancer. Half of all cases are spotted at a late stage, when treatment is less likely to be successful, and survival rates are among the worst in Europe. A new NHS cancer taskforce will evaluate seven schemes designed to speed up diagnosis, including self-referral for tests. The proposal has been welcomed by radiologists, whose scans and X-rays are the first line of diagnosis for most cancers. But they said any increase in testing must be matched with investment in staff. Lack of resources means many patients wait more than a month for the results of potentially vital X-rays, CT and MRI scans. Giles Maskell, president of the Royal College of Radiologists, said early testing was key to saving lives, but added: ‘We are already seeing the system creaking at the seams. We definitely welcome the focus on early diagnosis but it has to come with investment.’ More than 60 hospitals in England will run pilot schemes aimed at improving cancer survival rates by catching the disease earlier . It is unlikely that those who self-refer will get direct access to tests, Dr Maskell said. Instead, it may be that those who are worried will go to a special clinic to be assessed. Other ideas to be covered by pilot schemes include making it easier for patients to have multiple tests in the same place on the same day and encouraging pharmacists to refer repeat customers for tests. The shake-up of cancer services also includes extra funding for a very precise form of radiotherapy that can be used to kill tumours which surgeons dare not cut out. Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy, or Cyberknife, has been championed by former England rugby captain Lawrence Dallaglio, whose mother died from cancer. He said the £15million funding boost over three years will double the number of patients who can benefit from the treatment. NHS England chief Simon Stevens said ‘too many patients are still being diagnosed late … so it’s time for a fresh look at how we can do even better’. Cancer Research UK’s Harpal Kumar, head of the taskforce, said the charity predicts cases will increase by a third over the next 15 years, ‘so the time is right to set new ambitions and look at how we will meet this need’.","More than 60 hospitals to run pilot scheme to improve cancer survival rate .

"They split in November after three years of dating and almost a year of being engaged. But on Saturday Robin Wright, 48, and Ben Foster, 34, looked very much back together as they held hands while walking through LAX airport in Los Angeles. The Forrest Gump star even had a ring on her wedding finger which was most likely her engagement jewelry. This comes just weeks after her ex-husband Sean Penn reportedly got 'secretly engaged' to his girlfriend Charlize Theron. Scroll down for video... Back in love?: Robin Wright was seen holding hands with her ex Ben Foster at LAX airport in Los Angeles on Saturday just two months after she called off their engagement . When they were engaged: Wright and Foster at the Golden Globe awards in January 2014 . Foster and Wright looked very in sync as they wore matching attire. Not only did they have the same aviator sunglasses on, but they also wore similar jeans and worn-in brown boots. The two also both had on cross body luggage. In November, UsWeekly reported the couple ended their 10-month engagement. 'She got swept up in the engagement last Christmas, but then their schedules got crazy and she realized it wasn't the right decision,' a source told the publication. Happy once again: The 48-year-old Forrest Gump actress was smiling as she walked through the terminal . Another sign they are back on: The House Of Cards star was also sporting a ring on her wedding finger . Leading the way: The 34-year-old actor kept a firm grip on his fiancée's hand as he walked in front of her . The couple's age difference - she is 14 years older - was cited as a major issue. The ex-wife of  Penn felt as if Ben was just 'too immature,' it was claimed. 'The gap just ended up being too much,' an insider revealed. 'Ben was kind of immature. She couldn't deal with him anymore.' He moved on: Sean Penn with rumoured fiancée Charlize Theron at the 4th Annual Sean Penn & Friends HELP HAITI HOME gala on Saturday in Los Angeles . Once in step: Robin and Sean, pictured at the NYC premiere of The Interpreter in 2005, were married from 1996 to 2010 . And the couple - they met on set of their 2011 film Rampart - were also working in separate cities, which created an emotional distance. Robin was shooting the Netflix show House of Cards in Baltimore while Ben was in London doing A Streetcar Named Desire on stage. During her downtime, Wright liked to visit her children - Dylan, 23, and Hopper Jack, 21 (their father is Penn) - in Los Angeles. Her hit series: The blonde beauty with Kevin Spacey (center) and Michel Gill (far left) in House Of Cards, which has been filming in Baltimore . Before Sean, who she wed in 1996 and divorced in 2010, Robin was married to Dane Witherspoon. Meanwhile, Penn (who was once wed to Madonna) directed his 39-year-old love Theron in the love story The Last Face in South Africa in 2014. Javier Bardem and Jean Reno also star. In December UsWeekly reported Penn and Theron were 'secretly engaged' but he had yet to buy her a ring. In August model Dylan, who used to date Robert Pattinson, said of her father and the bombshell: 'They're a great couple. They're both very happy and, yeah, I love it.' She added, 'They're both extremely strong personalities and they're very intelligent, so conversation lasts between them.' In February 2014 Robin broke her silence on her divorce from Sean. The Forrest Gump star told a British paper, 'Divorce in and of itself, and with children, is devastating. Worse than that. 'One of the reasons why we got back together and broke up so much was trying to keep the family together. If you've got kids, it's a family, and you try again, and you try again. We did that for a long time.'","Robin, 48, became engaged to Ben, 34, in December 2013 .

"Liverpool have offered Jordan Henderson an improved contract worth £80,000-per-week. Henderson, who joined Liverpool from Sunderland in 2011, has just over 18 months left to run on his existing deal - which is worth in the region of £65,000-per-week. But the Anfield club want to tie the England international down to new terms after fully-establishing himself as an integral member of Brendan Rodgers' first-team. Jordan Henderson has established himself as a key member of Brendan Rodgers' Liverpool team . Henderson closes down Liverpool team-mate Raheem Sterling during England training last week . Talks regarding fresh terms are well underway and an offer has now been made to the club's vice-captain. The new deal is understood to be a five-year contract, worth just over £4million per season. Whether the terms are enough to convince Henderson to sign the contract remains to be seen, but Liverpool are determined to secure the midfielder's long-term future.

"An upscale San Francisco neighborhood was rocked on Friday after four men sitting in a parked car were gunned down in a drive-by shooting. Police have not yet released the identities of the four men killed in the shooting, or a description of the suspects, but its believed the incident was gang related. Over the past few decades, the neighborhood of Hayes Valley has become a popular place for young professionals with it's mix of stately Victorian homes, popular restaurants and trendy boutiques. As police increased their patrols in case of retaliatory attacks over the weekend, these residents expressed their shock that something so terrifying could happen in their otherwise safe neighborhood. Scroll down for video . Deadly: Four men were killed Friday night while sitting in a parked car in San Francisco's upscale Hayes Valley neighborhood. Police believe the shooting was gang related . Gentrified: Over the past few decades, once-seedy Hayes Valley has turned into a mecca for young professionals with its mix of Victorian homes, boutiques and popular restaurants. Above, a resident's reaction to Friday night's shooting . Rocked: Many in the Hayes Valley were surprised that gang-related violence would happen in their 'safe' neighborhood . 'Moved from Booklyn to SF for this?' resident Chris Surowiec tweeted shortly after the shooting. 'It’s surprising,” Redwood City resident Landon Fabianski, 19, told SF Gate. Fabianski works at a men's clothing store on the Hayes Street, the main thoroughfare in the neighborhood. 'I thought it was more of an upscale neighborhood. I never thought there would be a shooting of that nature here.' 'It seems like such a nice, safe neighborhood,' added shopper Heather Houston, 33. Police were first called to the scene around 10pm on Friday night when residents started reporting more than a dozen gunshots. All four inside the car died at the scene. Julie Albin was driving past the intersection of Laguna and Page Streets the moment gunfire rang out. 'I'm a little jarred right now that I witnessed that,' she told ABC 7. 'I wasn't sure what it was at first but now that I see it I'm a little freaked out that we were right next to them.' Quadruple homicide: Gunshots rang out around 10pm local time on Friday night. All four men inside the car parked at Laguna and Page Streets died at the scene . On the run: A 'possibly silver Scion' was seen speeding away from the scene, but so far no arrests have been made . Shocked: Resident Julie Albin was driving by the intersection when the shooting happened. 'I'm a little jarred right now that I witnessed that,' she told ABC 7 . A 'possibly silver Scion' was seen speeding away, according to reports, but police have yet to release a firm description of the vehicle. San Francisco broadcaster KGO reported some bullets struck inside surrounding homes, including one that lodged in a refrigerator. By early Saturday, police had covered some areas of the shooting scene with yellow tarps, cordoned off several blocks and began canvassing the area for witnesses. Police believe the car in which the men were killed may have been stolen, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. Police Chief Greg Suhr says the gang task force and homicide units are working together to investigate the shooting. He said four guns were likely used in the shooting, and that two were found inside the stolen car parked at Page and Laguna Streets. In memory: On Saturday, residents set up a makeshift memorial near the scene of the shooting which reads: 'Drive-by, 4 people, rest in peace' Damage: A man named Red notices bullet holes in a nearby shop Saturdayin San Francisco, the morning after a quadruple homicide occurred . While police patrols were increased in the neighborhood over the weekend, in case of retaliatory attacks, Suhr said the attack appears to have been targeted and neighbors have no need to fear. While newer residents of the neighborhood were shocked by the shooting, longtime residents saw Friday's tragedy as a reminder of Hayes Valley's once-seedy past. Before the Lomo Prieta earthquake of 1989, the old Central Highway passed through Hayes Valley, and was a magnet for drug and other criminal activity. While Hayes Valley itself has evolved over the past few decades, it's still surrounded by more precarious neighborhoods. Board of Supervisors President London Breed grew up in public housing near the Hayes Valley neighborhood and knew some of the victims' families. 'It’s really hard. It’s heartbreaking to the community, and it’s heartbreaking toward the families. A lot of people are hurting right now,' Breed told SF Gate. On Saturday morning, a priest at the nearby San Francisco Zen Center set up a makeshift memorial for the four people killed. It reads: 'drive by 4 people rest in peace' and is surrounded by flowers. 'I had hoped violence and the causes of violence in the neighborhood were done,' priest Victoria Austin, 61, told USA Today. 'It's not over. It's a shock to everyone. It's painful and we don't know much about it.'","Four men sitting in a parked car in the Hayes Valley neighborhood of San Francisco were shot dead Friday night .

"A report released by a German investigative group insists it was a Russian missile launcher that shot down flight MH17 in July killing all 298 passengers. Searching For The Truth, a documentary produced by CORRECT!V, offers fresh testimonies from military experts, separatist fighters and residents of East Ukraine. They have also collected photo, video and satellite evidence to produce a compelling account of how events unfolded on July 17 last year. Their findings come just one day after pictures emerged of the Ukrainian air force pilot accused by pro-Russian rebels of being the man who shot the plane down. Scroll down for video . Fresh claim: A report released by a German investigative group insists a Buk surface to air missile launcher (model pictured) operated by the 53rd Russian Air Defense Brigade shot down flight MH17 . The German investigative group claims the Malaysia Airlines passenger plane was shot down by a Buk surface to air missile launcher operated by the 53rd Russian Air Defense Brigade, Kyiv Post reports. They say the the armed vehicle entered Ukraine to protect Russian armor that had been vulnerable to aerial attack earlier in the conflict - which erupted in April when Kremlin-backed militants seized several government buildings in the Donbas. Speaking to CORRECT!V, military experts claimed only specially-trained troops acting as a tight and well-drilled unit could have operated the Buk. They would have had just seconds, from when they sighted the plane, to switch on their radar and accurately fire the rocket. New evidence: Searching For The Truth, a documentary produced by CORRECT!V, offers fresh testimonies from military experts, separatist fighters and residents of East Ukraine . Tragic: The crash killed all the 298 people on board the Boeing, which was en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur . Reporters working for the German investigative group travelled to the town of Snizhne in east Ukraine, held by Kremlin-backed separatists. Several people they spoke to in the town described sights and sounds consistent with the launch of a Buk missile on the day flight MH17 crashed. One witness went further, claiming he had seen the vehicle and then the missile shooting into the sky afterwards. They said: 'They shot it down. The missile flew from here. We saw it, as it flew. I was in the yard and heard an explosion, a bang. It was a really loud bang. The tiles on my roof shook. 'Then there was a long sound. And then a very loud explosion: bang, bang. And just as I ran out into the road, the plane began to fall. Down the road, several kilometers from here. And you could see it burn.' CORRECT!V also interviewed a former SBU officer turned separatist commander, Aleksandr Khodakovskiy, who initially told Reuters his fighters were in possession of a Buk, before retracting his statement. Soft toys are seen near the crash site of the Malaysia Airlines flight after it was supposedly shot down in July . Ukrainian State Emergency Service employees collect bodies of victims at the site of the crash . Khodakovskiy says a Buk from Russia was sent back after the MH17 disaster, but his forces are still supported by one Buk unit. He suggested neither are operated by his militia, claiming they did not have the specialists for such high precision weapons systems. However in August, footage shot by a clandestine Ukrainian police team showed an image of a BUK weapons system on a Volvo truck being smuggled out of eastern Ukraine in the early hours of July 18, the day after the plane crash. Searching for the Truth also trashes rival claims by Russian authorities that a Ukrainian jet downed MH17. The report claims that the type of damage that existed on the wreckage could only have been caused by a surface to air missile. Rival claim: Pro-Russian rebels have accused Ukrainian pilot Captain Vladislav Voloshin (above) of being the 'executioner' of the 298 victims on board doomed Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 . Volshin has not spoken directly on the loss of MH17 but denied through his superiors that he was responsible. Ukraine blames Russia for a crude propaganda stunt in naming him . They also conclude that a jet firing on the front of the passenger plane would have to have been travelling from Russian airspace - which MH17 was just 40 kilometers away from entering. Despite these apparent facts, the Russian Investigative Committee - equivalent of the FBI - believe a Ukrainian pilot is responsible for the tragedy. They are calling for Captain Vladislav Voloshin to take a lie-detector test and face formal questioning, asserting there is compelling evidence against him which should be considered by the Dutch-led official probe. Believed to be in his late 20s, he was named by stems from a 'secret witness' at his Dnipropetrovsk air base who says the pilot took off in his Su-17 combat jet on 17 July last year armed with air-to-air missiles. Footage shot by a clandestine Ukrainian police team showed an image of a BUK weapons system on a Volvo truck being smuggled out of eastern Ukraine in the early hours of 18 July . The report from CORRECT!V suggest the Russian Investigative Committee's are completely untrue. Aside from new witness testimonies, much of the report's findings are taken from information already in the public domain - including evidence from reputable open source investigators Bellingcat. Bellingcat has spent months gathering and verifying evidence related to Russian troop movements in Ukraine. They geolocated photos of a Buk missile launcher on its journey from Snizhne to Russia immediately after the MH17 was downed. From this they were able to identify the armed vehicle as belonging to Russia's 53rd Air Defense Brigade, based in Kursk. Investigators did so by matching a partially obscured identification number and the unique scratches and dents shown in the Snizhne photos with pictures and footage taken in June of a convoy of Russian armour as it drives towards the Ukrainian border from Kursk. Searching for the Truth also trashes rival claims by Russian authorities that a Ukrainian jet downed MH17 . Eliot Higgins, founder of Bellingcat, said: 'At this point it's undeniable the Russian military provided the Buk It seems that the one key piece of information is autopsy data from the Dutch criminal investigation. 'They've confirmed pieces of metal were found in the bodies, and if they come from a Buk warhead then I don't think there will be any question about who was responsible for shooting down MH17.' The Russian Investigative Committee says Ukrainian pilot Captain Vladislav Voloshin took off in his Su-17 combat jet on 17 July last year armed with air-to-air missiles but landed without them - proving their theory he is responsible for the crime. Voloshin has not spoken directly on the loss of MH17 but denied through his superiors that he was responsible.

Officers were called to McDonald's Mittagong on Bowral Road about 8.50pm on Sunday after responding to reports a man was claiming he had been attacked . She told the Nine Network he had been on a three day ice binge and threatened to kill her before he left their house, ending up at the nearby McDonald's. Mr Norris's younger brother, David, criticised the police tactics used. 'I don't think the sort of punishment he got was appropriate,' David told AAP. 'I've lost all respect for police officers.'

She tsaid he had been on a three day ice binge and threatened to kill her before he left their house, ending up at the nearby McDonald's . When police arrived at the scene, Norris - who was unarmed - got into a fight with two officers who were injured during the incident. He was Tasered by police after he would not calm down after they tried to talk to him. He was then taken to Bowral Police Station and died a short time later. Mr Norris had just moved to Mittagong from Gunning, about 130km away, to be with his girlfriend who lived near the restaurant. 'He had problems his whole life, mixing with the wrong crowd,' his brother David said. 'But a couple of years ago he started getting his life back on track and doing well for himself. 'He was working every day, got a licence, got his first car.'

Mr Norris was handcuffed at the restaurant and was conscious when he arrived at the police station, Police and ambulance officers tried to resuscitate him after he collapsed but were unsuccessful. Assistant Commissioner Gary Worboys said CCTV would form an important part of the investigation as there weren't many witnesses. 'There's no doubt there will be footage from the fast food restaurant, indeed the police station,' he said. An autopsy is expected to be carried out in the next couple of days. 'It is a tragic set of circumstances and our thoughts go out to his family and friends,' Mr Worboys said. Police said CCTV would form an important part of the investigation as there weren't many witnesses . 'And also to the two police officers who are recuperating.' After initially stating Mr Norris had not been known to police, a spokesperson informed the media on Monday afternoon they had actually had previous contact with him. A critical incident investigation has been launched. Mr Worboys confirmed to reporters on Monday Norris was conscious when he was arrested but then 'slumped to the ground' at the station.

Mr Rowlands, whose congregations are in Powys, North Wales, said a ban would affect the ‘spiritual health of communities’ if he couldn’t reach elderly people who cannot get to church. Apologising for his speeding, he also pleaded 'exceptional hardship'  as he apologised for his speeding. The court heard Mr Rowlands, who has been a minister for 46 years, was still in charge of 10 chapels across a very large rural area around Welshpool. He said he believed he had learned his lesson after being caught for a fourth time in just four years. Prosecutor Justin Espie told the court Rowlands, of Rhewl, Ruthin, pleaded guilty to driving too fast in a 30mph zone in Talybont on May 10, 2014, reports the Powys County Times. When the minister was stopped by police at around 10am on the morning in question he made officers aware of the fact he already had nine points on his licence. He said he needed to be able to drive to travel across vast areas of countryside between the chapels he was responsible for and also to preach in the homes of worshippers to frail to get to church themselves. If he was disqualified, he argued, he would no longer be able to carry out these duties. In cross-examination, Mr Espie questioned Rowlands as to whether he would lose his job or his home as a result of being disqualified. The priest admitted he would not. Magistrates accepted his argument of exceptional hardship and fined him £70, ordered him to pay costs of £85 and a victim surcharge of £20.

"Every man, woman and child should be regularly weighed to halt ‘skyrocketing’ levels of obesity, experts believe. The National Obesity Forum has warned that the spiralling cost of treating obesity could ‘break the NHS’ – and the threat is magnified by people being blind to their size. To millions of Britons, being dangerously overweight is now simply normal. Fear: The National Obesity Forum has warned that the spiralling cost of treating obesity could ‘break the NHS’ – and the threat is magnified by people being blind to their size . In its annual report, the forum calls for regular monitoring of the weight of all adults. And it wants all young children to be weighed annually. Regularly logging measurements would allow doctors to spot those whose weight is creeping up – and catch them before they become dangerously fat. With obesity costing the UK almost £45billion a year, and Hungary the only European country to have a bigger obesity problem than Britain, the NOF says we have now reached a ‘critical point’. The State of the Nation’s Waistlines 2015 report paints a bleak picture of Britain’s obesity battle. Obesity levels have doubled in the last two decades and today 67 per cent of men overweight or obese. Women are not far behind, with fewer than half a normal, healthy weight. The forum warns the problem is more serious still among children. Figures published in December and described a tragedy by the chief executive of Public Health England, show that 22.5 per cent of boys and girls are overweight or obese at the age of four or five. By the time they reach 10 or 11, the figure is 33.5 per cent. Children are weighed on starting primary school and again on leaving – but the National Obesity Forum says annual weigh-in are essential if weight gain is to be caught early and nipped in the bud. Spokesman Tam Fry  says the current system has provided lots of data about childhood obesity – but the long gap between measurements means it has done nothing for individual children. The National Obesity Forum wants people's weights to be monitored to cut the cost of obesity on the NHS . Mr Fry, who is also honorary chairman of the Child Growth Foundation, said: ‘If a child is weighed aged four and not weighed again until they are ten, you have got six years where that child is putting on weight. ‘A good proportion of our children are getting fatter and fatter.’ Mr Fry also wants GPs to routinely weigh all their adult patients. The sheer numbers involved mean annual weigh-ins would not be practical but it may be possible to put each patient on the scales every three years. Currently, weigh-ins are done on an ad-hoc basis. Women who are on the pill, people who need repeat prescriptions of certain drugs, those having heart check-ups are among those who will be put on the scales but there is no systematic plan in place. As a result, some patients can go years without their weight being recorded by their family doctor. Other said that while tracking weight gain is important, it isn’t necessarily a job for GPs. For instance, it could be done by practice nurses or by community slimming clubs. The problem is compounded by many people being blind to their weight problem. A ComRes poll found that only 6 per cent of Britons consider themselves to be obese – despite the true figure being around 25 per cent. Dame Sally Davies, the Chief Medical Officer, has warned that millions of Britons do not realise they are overweight because it is now seen as being normal. She said that high street shops are exacerbating the problem by altering size labels to make shoppers think they are thinner than they actually are. Today’s report also calls for routine weighing of pregnant women, clearer labelling of food and highlights the growing price gap between healthy and unhealthy foods. The NOF also warns that without extra training for GPs on how to broach the subject of obesity and better access to specialist weight loss services, a new national anti-obesity drive could fail. Announced last month, it will involve GPs identifying patients whose weight puts them at risk of diabetes. Professor David Haslam, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘Obesity levels have skyrocketed in the last 20 years and as a country we need to do more. ‘We should be under no illusions. ‘Obesity represents one of the most serious threats to the health of the UK population and has the potential of breaking the NHS.’ Last night, Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, said: ‘Rising obesity is the fastest growing health threat facing us as individuals and as a nation. ‘So the NHS, schools, parents, employers and the food industry now need to get our collective act together.’ He added that new focus on people at risk of diabetes will be ‘ground-breaking’.","National Obesity Forum has warned treating overweight could 'break NHS'

"Psychic: The wannabe glamour model is selling her services online . Josie Cunningham - who gained notoriety for claiming a breast operation on the NHS - is now working as a psychic. Ms Cunningham, 24, charges £70 per hour for her services, advertising her 'special powers' on online classified-hub Gumtree. This comes just weeks after the mother-of-three announced that she has been given her own Channel 4 documentary, although the channel said the programme had not yet been finalised. 'I've always thought I might be psychic, I often saw random flashes and shadows as a kid, ' Miss Cunningham told The Sun. 'I've been watching YouTube videos on how to channel my gift and £70 per hour seems fair,' she said, adding that her services had been booked withing 15 minutes of her uploading the advertisement on Gumtree. 'I still want to be a glamour model but this will tide me over until I get a new nose.' The 24-year-old shot to notoriety when she boasted about having a £4,800 breast enlargement on the NHS. Anger over her shameless boasts about life of benefits grew when she claimed she considered aborting her child so she could appear on TV show Big Brother. Even her mother has since said she has only  herself to blame for becoming despised by much of the British public. Her dreams of appearing on her own TV programme seem to have come true after Channel 4 decided to make her the star of a documentary. Her agent, Rob Cooper, tweeted on New Year;s Eve: 'CONFIRMED: ""Josie: The Most Hated Woman In Britain"" will air on Thursday 22nd January at 10pm on Channel 4. #JosieCunningham' Miss Cunningham retweeted the message to her 70,000 followers on the social network, sparking a mixture of anger from critics and joy among fans. While some of her followers replied 'love you Josie' and 'I'll be watching', another posted: 'Not paying my tv license again if they put that moose on my box!' Website user Mark Bedford added: 'You must be so proud. Parading round a bargain basement Katie Price for ridicule like some Victorian freak show. Well done.' Despite agent Mr Cooper's claim, a spokesman for Channel 4 said the schedule has not yet been finalised and the show was not therefore confirmed. Josie Cunningham, pictured with fiance Andrew Goy, is now working as a £70-and-hour psychic . Cunningham's agent revealed the news on Twitter, with what he claims is the time and date it will air . It came after Miss Cunningham announced her engagement to Andrew Goy by sharing a photo of her pink heart-shaped engagement ring online. The engagement, which was then confirmed by a representative for Miss Cunningham, comes just weeks after the couple were first pictured in Leeds city centre. There have also been reports that Miss Cunningham is pregnant with Goy's child. Last week, Miss Cunningham revealed she had wrongly told one man that he was the father of her three-month-old daughter by sending him the wrong DNA result. She had asked three men to take a paternity test to determine who was Grace's father and wrote the outcome in cards to be delivered in time for Christmas Day. But the mother-of-three mixed up the notes and sent the positive result to the wrong man. Miss Cunningham shared her blunder with her Twitter followers before comparing her life to an episode of EastEnders. Josie Cunningham became a household name when she admitted undergoing £4,800 worth of breast enhancement surgery paid by the NHS to increase her bust from a 32A to 36DD. She claimed she needed the surgery because she had been bullied since the age of 14 for being flat chested. Later it also emerged that she received Botox on the NHS over a 'sweat problem'. Josie's most controversial outburst came when she publicly considered aborting the child because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Channel 5's Big Brother. The mother-of-three later said she was receiving negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide her with a £6,000-a-year taxi to take her children to school. The former escort made headlines again when she said now wanted a nose job - funded by the public. She set up a website called fundmynose.co.uk to encourage people to donate towards the £3,000 cosmetic operation. She claimed she was fed up of people comparing her to The Muppets’ Miss Piggy and now wants a brand new nose which is a ‘cross between Michelle Keegan and Jennifer Aniston’. It came after the wannabe glamour model, who previously worked a stint as a £1,000-a-night escort girl, told female students 'not to worry' if their exam results were not quite what they were hoping for. Josie, from Leeds, made headlines after having £4,800 breast enlargement surgery paid for by the NHS . As A-level exam results this month, she tweeted: 'Good luck to everyone getting your A-level results today. Girls don't worry if ur results are poor - you can always have a career getting your t***s out or escorting. (Obviously if your over 18!). #Josie'sCareerAdvice' Earlier this month, the mother-of-three stepped out with a Girl Power painting sprawled over her bump, before announcing she would be setting up a trust fund to pay for her daughter's boob job. Josie had previously suggested she would reimburse the NHS for the cost of her controversial breast enhancement surgery. Using the hashtag #BritishPublic0JosieCunningham1, Josie said she made the decision because '80% of the country are against' her. The mother-of-two had earlier spoken of her devastation when doctors told her she was having a third boy. She admitted she smoked a whole packet of cigarettes and drank one glass of wine after the other because she felt 'genuinely gutted'. Afterwards, she decided to sell tickets to the live birth of her child. Four tickets to the home birth had sold out in just 14 minutes - netting her £30,000. It is thought that three of the four tickets were purchased by journalists while the fourth is believed to have been bought by somebody described as 'a super-fan'. She later said that 50 fans would be able to log on to the video chat service Skype and watch the former prostitute's delivery via videolink. But, earlier this month, despite saying some of the money would go back to the NHS, she had a change of heart when she found out she was having a girl.","Josie, 24, gained notoriety for claiming £5,000 breast op on NHS .

"Selling linen and tableware in only one colour may not sound like a million-pound idea. But Chrissie Rucker went six times better than that – making a staggering £6.5million last year, £2million more than the year before. The 46-year-old White Company founder is now one of Britain’s highest-paid businesswomen after sales of the firm’s white-only goods soared over the past 12 months. The home furnishings and fashion chain sells everything from £70 candles to £200 cashmere jumpers in a range of ‘neutral’, ‘winter white’ and ‘biscuit marl’ tones. Scroll down for video . White Company founder Chrissie Rucker is now one of Britain’s highest-paid businesswomen . Tapping into the trend for clean, fresh furnishings, it has become a hit with middle-class families and now has 50 stores. The latest accounts show sales of £144million in the 12 months to March, up from £126million the year before. Miss Rucker founded the business 20 years ago after she struggled to find high-quality, affordable white bed linen and tableware for her boyfriend Nicholas Wheeler’s new flat. They later married and are one of Britain’s most successful entrepreneurial couples, worth an estimated £295million. Mr Wheeler runs the Charles Tyrwhitt shirt business and the couple were 326th in the 2014 Sunday Times rich list, up from 427th the year before. They live with their four children in a £12.5million grade I listed 17th Century manor in Buckinghamshire. After the launch of its US website last year, profits at The White Company rose by 38 per cent, while the payment to its highest-paid director, understood to be Miss Rucker, grew by 44 per cent from £4.5million to £6.5million. Miss Rucker is married to Nicholas Wheeler, who runs the Charles Tyrwhitt shirt business. They are one of Britain’s most successful entrepreneurial couples, worth an estimated £295million . Miss Rucker came up with the idea of a company selling white-only furnishings after trying to find ‘lovely white linen, towels, bathrobes, china and napkins’ for Mr Wheeler’s new home. She was disappointed by what she found on the High Street and shared her thoughts with her future sister-in-law Susie. Miss Rucker recalled: ‘She had just been through exactly the same thing, and she said “wouldn’t it be brilliant if there was a company that just sold white things?” So that was it, and I couldn’t sleep for the next couple of weeks because I was so excited.’ She quit her job as a beauty journalist and set up a mail order catalogue, armed with a small government grant and £6,000 she had inherited from her grandmother. Miss Rucker, who had no business experience and left school at 16 with a C in her maths O-Level, now employs more than 1,000 workers and was awarded an MBE in 2010 for services to retail.

"The lead investigator in the case of missing William Tyrell says there are still 10 officers working full-time to find the three-year-old, four months after he first disappeared. Superintendent Paul Fehon, from Port Macquarie LAC, said investigators were still committed to finding out what happened to William despite not finding any clues since he went missing on September 12 last year. This comes as it was revealed William’s sister often asks 'Has anyone seen my little brother?' It has been four months of agony for the three-year-old's family ever since he disappeared without a trace from his grandmother's backyard  in Kendall on the New South Wales mid north coast, while dressed in a Spider-Man costume. Scroll down for video . William Tyrell was last seen wearing his favourite Spiderman costume when he disappeared on September 12 . Monday marks four months to the day since he went missing from Kendall on the Mid North Coast of NSW . Supt Fehon said investigators had recanvassed the area near where William was last seen in the past weeks, including searching a 1.5km radius with specialist cadaver dogs. ‘There is no indication of where he may be,’ Supt Fehon told Daily Mail Australia. ‘We’ve still got a dedicated team in excess of 10 analysts and investigators working full-time and they’re going to explore every possible avenue. ‘The main thing is going through the many hundreds of Crime Stoppers reports which have been received from the public and evaluating them, prioritising them and then being able to determine the value of the information.’ He said William's parents were being kept up to date with the investigation through what has been an ‘extremely difficult period’. ‘They’ve had to endure a Christmas without young William,’ he said. ‘They’ve indicated to me that words cannot describe their pai. Lead investigator superintendent Paul Fehon points to the house where three-year-old William was last seen . ‘They pray and hope young William will be returned to them in 2015.’ When William Tyrell's sister walks into a room, she often asks 'Has anyone seen my little brother?' It has been four months of agony for the three-year-old's family ever since he disappeared without a trace from his grandmother's backyard in Kendall on the New South Wales mid north coast. Police still have no leads as to his whereabouts, with extensive searches of the bushland around the property failing to uncover any clues. Kendall local Kay Dollery says William's four-year-old sister, who lives with their parents on Sydney's north shore, often asks after her brother. Ms Dollery had William's Sydney neighbours stay with her when they travelled to Kendall to help during the initial week-long search in September. 'I've been to Sydney and had dinner with one of them and they said the sister keeps coming in and saying ""Has anyone seen my little brother?""' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'It just brings you to tears. Supt Fuhon has revealed the Tyrell family endured a heartbreaking Christmas . When William Tyrell's younger sister walks into a room, she often asks 'Has anyone seen my brother?' Ms Dollery said the people of Kendall remained hopeful William would be found, but were devastated to have no clues four months to the day of his disappearance. 'Going through Christmas was pretty sad - the services club had William's Christmas tree which was beautiful - but I think [the mood] is just sombre as we know there is no change which is disheartening,' she said. 'I think it comes down to the question of there's just been no sign of him and that's the baffling part of it, that there's no indication of where he is, there's no indication that he was taken he's just vanished. 'I think in real terms most people would have the opinion that someone's got him and then they just live in hope that whoever's got him is looking after him and hasn't done anything awful.' This comes after it was revealed that homicide detectives are now leading the investigation into his disappearance, The Sunday Telegraph reported. Superintendent Paul Fehon, from Port Macquarie Local Area Command, said Christmas was a difficult time for the family. Members of the Kendall Services and Citizens Club gave a collection of gifts and Spiderman merchandise to William's parents in hopes the missing three-year-old will appear soon . Homicide detectives have taken over the investigation of  William Tyrell who disappeared on September 12 . Police still have no leads as to his whereabouts, with extensive searches of the bushland around the property failing to uncover any clues . 'They indicated to me that Christmas was just a quiet silent time at home, the emptiness of having a void in their house,' Supt Fehon told The Sunday Telegraph. 'That's been unopened presents, not able to share the festivities, to see a smile on young William's face to receive gifts or presents like any other normal child.' Supt Fehon said a lack of evidence to support the potential scenarios has left investigators baffled. For the first time he has also outlined a detailed account of the sequence of events before William's disappearance. His grandmother, mother and four-year-old sister were enjoying a relaxing morning on the driveway of his grandmother's property. Dressed in his favourite superhero costume, William was playing a game of hide-and-seek with his sister. He was dashing around the side of the house before reappearing with a smile and returning to his his family. When he ran around out of view at about 10.25am on September 12, his mother did not check on him until 10.30am, when she went around the corner looking for him and he was nowhere to be seen. Lead Investigator superintendant Paul Fehon said a lack of evidence to support any scenario has left investigators stumped . Locals say the people of Kendall remain hopeful William would be found, but are devastated to have no clues . Neighbours watched the family frantically scouring the area and calling out his name, before they contacted police shortly afterwards. One neighbour saw William’s distraught mother pacing the quite street after William went missing. Afterwards, his father, who had been at the shops, returned and instantly joined into the search. The family had visited Kendall before, with locals recalling seeing them the previous December. Another neighbour said the community has been rocked by William’s disappearance, with children no longer allowed to ride their bikes or visit the local store without supervision. William was last seen in the front yard of his grandmother's house at Kendall, on the NSW mid-north coast . Investigators have now also outlined a detailed account of the sequence of events before William's disappearance . In a major turn for the investigation, murder squad officers are now leading inquiries - meaning the case is no longer a missing persons investigation. Homicide Squad boss Detective Superintendent Michael Willing told the Sunday Telegraph that the investigation had taken a new direction. 'We want to do a thorough investigation to determine what's happened to William and obviously we need to consider the worst case scenario,' Supt Willing said. A NSW police spokeswoman confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that homicide detectives are now leading the investigation. 'The homicide squad are involved to ensure thorough investigation but we have no evidence to suggest any particular scenario at this stage,' a police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia. Detectives have spoken to every person they could locate who was in Kendall that day when the little boy disappeared at Benaroon Drive about 10.30am, five minutes after he was last seen by his grandmother and mother. He had been playing with his four-year-old sister. Detectives, who found no trace of William during an intense nine-day search and were concentrating their investigation on the theory that William was abducted, have previously described the case as 'astonishing'. Searches combed bushland surrounding the home of missing toddler William Tyrell's grandmother . Police have spoken to everyone they could locate who was in Kendall on the day little William disappeared . A huge search of surrounding properties and bushland failed to find a trace of the boy. One lead police have investigated is a report of a 'well-dressed, well-spoken' man who reportedly asked a local shopkeeper for directions to Batar Creek Road, which leads to Benaroon Drive, on the morning William disappeared. William's family thanked searchers for their hard work. 'Thank you does not seem like the right sort of word to express our gratitude and heartfelt warmth we feel towards each and every one of you,' a statement from the family said. 'We have been completely overwhelmed with the way the public, SES, Surf Life Saving, RFS and the Police have rallied together to find our little Spiderman William.'

"This is the moment a man attacked a police officer with a shovel at the start of a tussle which ended with him being shot dead. James Barker, 42, was caught by the officer's body camera swinging the implement at him from a porch in Salt Lake City, Utah, just one street away from Barker's home. The footage shows the officer - who has not been named - sprawling onto the floor before further blows rain down from above. Scroll down for video . Lashing out: James Barker, 42, was filmed swinging his snow shovel at a police officer in Salt Lake City, Utah, at the beginning of a fight which would end with him being shot dead . Threats: Barker had brandished the shovel after a confrontation over what he said was his snow removal business. He shouted at the officer, was pushed, then hit him with the shovel, fracturing several bones . In the ensuing fight, the policeman drew his pistol and shot Barker dead. A witness to the confrontation on Thursday afternoon said he was hit three times in the stomach. The camera did not capture the shooting as it was damaged during the shovel attack and stopped filming. It followed a heated argument between the officer and Barker, who got angry when the officer confronted him with reports he was acting suspiciously. Barker said he was trying to drum up customers for his snow-clearing business, and got angry when the officer kept questioning him and asked for his name. He eventually shouted at the officer that he was just 'trying to do my business'. The camera seems to show the officer push Barker away after he shouts and points - at which point he threatens him with the shovel then swings it. Anger: In the conversation, during which Barker refused to give his name, he shouted at the officer that he was only doing 'my business' Aggressive: He pointed at the officer and told him to get back in his car and drive away . The footage shows the officer get out of his patrol car and approach the man, who claimed to be offering to clear snow from houses in a suburb of the city - despite there being little snow on the ground. The officer said: ''I've had a couple of people call about you saying we don't have any snow to be removed - I wonder what you're doing in the area... I've had neighbors call saying they saw you looking in cars yesterday.' Barker claimed to have a business license but wouldn't give details, or tell the officer his name when asked. He later said he was looking for business ahead of time for when it snowed again. When questioned and asked again for his name - then threatened with arrest - he shouted repeatedly: 'I'm doing my business', then said 'I'm trying to make a living.' The police officer radios for backup, and tells Barker to calm down. When he doesn't, the officer pushes him back, and Barker retaliates. Push: The officer was filmed pushing Barker back - at which point he retaliates with the shovel, knocking the officer over . Witness Richard Grow said saw the two men fighting on the ground, before the officer shot Barker three times in the stomach. He told Fox13: 'One guy flies off the porch, somebody else flies off the porch and lands on him . 'I’m thinking this must be two roommates who came out of the house and are going to settle on the lawn. But then next thing I saw, he pulled out a gun and shot him.' A statement from Salt Lake City police said: 'A resident called police about a suspicious man asking people in the area if he could shovel the snow off their walks for money. 'An officer responded and made contact with him. Soon after the man attacked the officer, hitting him several times with the shovel. The officer drew his handgun and shot the man, killing him. 'The deceased is James Barker, 42, a Salt Lake City resident. The officer was transported to the hospital and found to have multiple fractures. He was treated and released.' Tumble: The footage shows the officer falling backwards off of the porch in suburban Salt Lake City . Last footage: The camera, pointing up in this frame, showed more blows from the shovel before it was damaged and stopped filming. Barker was shot seconds later . Barker's court records show he was arrested and booked into jail for disturbing the peace and failing to give police his identity, KSL.com reported, but no major or violent crimes. The officer has been placed on paid administrative leave while the incident is investigated by Salt Lake City police and the DA's office. Protesters rallied in Salt Lake City Saturday afternoon to denounce the shooting, which the characterized as unnecessary. The Utah Against Police Brutality activist group said: 'We believe that if the police take a life, they should not investigate themselves... The shooting of James Barker is yet another case which should be handled by an impartial third-party with no departmental affiliations.' However, a spokesman for the Utah Fraternal Order of Police said the video demonstrates a clear example of an officer doing his job. The spokesman said: 'Officers have a job to do, and frankly the amount of victim-blaming on the officer is ridiculous and doesn't leave much air in the room for a rational discussion. That officer did nothing to provoke such an aggravated assault.'","James Barker, 42, was filmed swinging snow shovel at officer in argument .

Rebecca and Chris Henderson of Hampton were blessed with two sets of twins with the help of in vitro fertilization--they also had 11 unused frozen embryos carrying their DNA. Since they believe life begins at conception, simply getting rid of the embryos was out of the question. Sharing the git of parenthood: Dan and Kelli Gassman adopted frozen embryos from a family across the country who had 11 left over following successful IVF who did not want to destroy them . Cue Dan and Kelli Gassman across the country in Salem, Oregon--another Christian couple desperate to be parents. The Gassmans had wanted an embryo and the Hendersons had too many. Soon after Rebecca Henderson became pregnant with a third child--this one an unassisted 'miracle baby'-- she and her husband signed away the 11 frozen embryos to the Gassmans. 'We have been blessed with three when we didn't think we'd have one, so, what kind of awesome thing is it to bless another couple and let them experience the same kind of joy we did?' Becky Henderson told USA Today. After the Hendersons had identical twins Abigail and Rachele, they paid a few hundred dollars per year to store the 11 leftover embryos. The Gassmans gave birth to Trevor two years ago with an egg implanted in Kelli's womb that was donated from the . Once they were blessed with an unexpected third child conceived naturally five years later, they decided three was enough. There are two major embryo 'adoption' agencies, Snowflakes Embryo Adoption program out of California and the National Embryo Donation Center of Tennessee. Both groups cater largely to people like the Gassmans and Henderson whose decision to 'adopt' an embryo is faith-based. 'It was kind of like a joining of hearts,' Kelli Gassman told USA Today. The Hendersons' twins are now 8 and have met the eldest Gassman kid, Trevor. The two families exchange photos on Facebook and the kids even spend time together on Skype. Meanwhile, having been blessed with the two children they always wanted, the Gassmans have actually returned the remaining embryos to the Hendersons. The Hendersons, in turn, have identified yet another family with whom they can share the joys of parenthood. The Gassmans' two children have a relationship with the Henderson twins via Skype and Facebook and the couple even gave back the remaining embryos, which the Hendersons plan to 'adopt' out to another Christian couple .","Rebecca and Chris Henderson of Hampton, Virginia believe life starts at conception and found a like-minded couple who also had fertility woes .

"A manager of a petrol station is being investigated after he allegedly smashed the windscreen of a grandmother's car with a fire bucket over a row about short changing her. The company that runs the service station in Cosham, near Portsmouth in Hampshire, said it was 'disappointed' the manager had failed to adopt their 'non-confrontational approach in dealing with a customer complaint.' Joanne Smith, 49, said she was scared and shocked when the manager emptied the fire bucket of sand and used it to smash the windscreen of the car while she, her daughter and grandchildren sat inside. Joanne Smith claims a petrol station manager smashed her windscreen with a fire bucket in row over change . The incident took place as the 49-year-old stopped off at a BP petrol station so she could fill up with petrol before taking her grandchildren to school. She said: 'I had my daughter and two grandchildren in the car and I remember I had £20 to get petrol, as well as bread and milk from the shops. 'That's why I knew I would get £10 back as I needed it later on. 'I said 'sir you have only given me change for £10, I gave you £20,' but he wasn't having any of it. 'I asked if he could check the till receipt or the CCTV because I was sure of the money I gave him, but he refused.' The windscreen was left badly smashed after the incident and police are investigating Mrs Smith's claims . Mrs Smith claims the incident took place on the petrol station forecourt in Cosham, near Portsmouth . Mrs Smith said she then called the police to report the incident, who told her it was a civil matter and she should speak to Trading Standards. She added: 'I wasn't happy with that. 'I admit I then provoked the situation because I wasn't happy and took a can of oil from the shelf and went and sat in my car until the police arrived. The manager allegedly hit the car with the bucket . 'A short while later the manager came over, emptied a fire bucket that was full of sand outside, and smashed my windscreen. 'I was scared and shocked at what had happened and can't afford to get it repaired.' Hampshire Police attended the incident and confirmed they are investigating a case of criminal damage. The force said no-one has been arrested. The BP petrol station is run by firm MRH retail. David Hathaway, group company secretary of MRH, said: 'Inspection of our till records indicate the customer did make a £20 cash payment and it appears once the disagreement began it quickly escalated. 'We're conducting our own investigation into the matter but because this is still in its early stages we are not prepared to discuss the details at this time. 'Nevertheless, based upon the evidence from our till records, we will be contacting the customer to refund to her the £10 of additional change that she is due from her transaction. 'We're disappointed the manager of the service station failed to observe our policy of adopting a non-confrontational approach when dealing with a customer complaint. 'While this type of mistake is unusual it does occasionally happen in all retail environments. 'In the rare event one of our customers considers they have not been given the correct amount of change, our policy is to try to resolve the customer's concern accurately, quickly and calmly at the point of sale.'","Joanne Smith stopped for petrol at service station in Cosham in Hampshire .

"Ed Miliband wants to force energy firms to pass on fall wholesale prices . Energy firms should be forced by law to cut bills when the wholesale cost of oil and gas falls, Ed Miliband said yesterday. The Labour leader wants industry regulator Ofgem to have new powers to compel companies to pass on cost savings to households. He will stage a vote in Parliament on Wednesday for fast-track legislation to bring ‘immediate relief’ to families, echoing his high-profile call at his party’s conference in 2013 for a freeze on energy prices. It comes as a report last night found that wholesale prices are now the lowest in more than three years, but household bills are still not reflecting the fall. Despite Chancellor George Osborne’s investigation into the wholesale oil market, the Labour leader urged him to ‘put his money where his mouth is’ and make it mandatory for companies to allow consumers to benefit from falling costs. The idea will also be seen by Mr Miliband as a way to avoid flak over his price freeze bid – which could keep demands higher than they otherwise would be. Last night the Conservatives said Labour was to blame because energy firms were holding back in the expectation of a price freeze. Mr Miliband told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘We do want to see those reductions in wholesale costs passed on to consumers. ‘We see wholesale costs go down 20 per cent in gas prices over the last year and no reduction in bills.’ He added: ‘We can do that as well as having this freeze to make sure energy bills don’t rise.’ Mr Miliband also called for a new ‘living standards index’ to track how household finances are affected by changes to wages, prices, taxes and benefits. He also confirmed Labour would retain the annual cap on benefits claims – and would not rule out reducing it. In its latest report, energy analysis firm ICIS predicted that the low wholesale prices will continue for the rest of the year. Chancellor George Osborne (left) has already launched a Treasury investigation into whether energy companies are passing on the savings from falls in the wholesale price of oil - while Business Minister Matt Hancock said Labour's proposal to freeze energy bills would have kept price artificially high . Wholesale prices are now 11 per cent down year on year, according to its latest power price index, with wholesale gas down more than 20 per cent. Mark Todd, of price comparison service energyhelpline, said: ‘Wholesale gas prices have collapsed so it is time the suppliers passed price cuts on to their loyal customers.’ But Lawrence Slade of Energy UK, which represents electricity and gas suppliers, said prices were a commercial matter for companies who often buy months ahead, making it difficult to pass on savings quickly. ‘No new powers are needed,’ he said. ‘Energy suppliers are already passing on price cuts to customers.’ Business and energy minister Matthew Hancock said the threat of Labour’s price freeze is responsible for higher household bills now. ‘If that’s the case, they should abandon it immediately,’ he said. Liberal Democrat Energy Secretary Ed Davey said it would be ‘disastrous’ for consumers, with ‘yo-yo’ bills and competition killed off by extra regulation . Critics have already claimed Mr Miliband’s price freeze plan will send Britain back to the ‘bad old days’ of seventies power cuts by halting the investment needed to avoid blackouts and rationing. Last night a Tory source said: ‘Like most of his great ideas, Ed Miliband’s energy policy will take us back to the 1970s.’ Liberal Democrat Energy Secretary Ed Davey said it would be ‘disastrous’ for consumers, with ‘yo-yo’ bills and competition killed off by extra regulation. Mr Miliband also warned against political ‘deals and coalitions’ yesterday, following speculation that he could strike a pact with the SNP or Alex Salmond. However, he refused four times to categorically rule out a coalition, sparking claims he had ‘left the door open’ to Mr Salmond, who is standing for Westminster in the Scottish constituency of Gordon.","Ofgem to get powers to compel firms to pass on falls in oil and gas prices .

"Crossrail is facing major signal problems which could prevent any trains from being allowed to run when the line's due to open in 2018. The South-East's £15billion new railway is on course for humiliation as engineers admitted the complex signal issues may not be resolved in the next three years. A source inside the project claimed it was still likely that Crossrail would open, with reduced services, but suggested said it was also possible that no trains would be running at all in 2018. Embarrassment: Crossrail is facing major signal problems which could prevent any trains from being allowed to run when it's due to open in 2018 . Crossrail adopts both traditional metro signalling and modern high-tech systems to connect trains on the 26 miles of new tracks underneath London to existing major cross-country rail lines. As it stands, engineers are struggling to create 'interfaces' - meaning the trains are unable to shift smoothly from the orthodox Metro system to the state of the art sytsem used once outside central London. Crossrail's chairman, Terry Morgan, conceded that a 'mitigation plan' was being put in place, The Independent reports. The admission confirms the worry that signalling on the 73-mile Berkshire-to-Essex link won't work properly by 2018. David Cameron and Boris Johnson inspecting Crossrail at Tottenham Court Road in January last year . 'This is one of the technical challenges that Crossrail brings with it,' added Mr Morgan. A source who has recently worked on Crossrail told The Independent: 'The most likely scenario is that Crossrail will open with a significantly reduced service.' A second source said: 'In the extreme you wouldn't be able to run any trains. Signalling technology in this industry is something that has challenged everybody for a very, very long time.' A huge part of Crossrail equates to a  a new underground system, running through  busy Tube stations such as Tottenham Court Road and Liverpool Street. But Network Rail, the government-backed body in charge of the country's most important train tracks, is hoping to introduce a highly complex signalling system across the lines, which will connect with Crossrail. Concern: Crossrail's chairman, Terry Morgan, conceded that a 'mitigation plan' was being put in place . This will feature technology akin to GPS, providing pinpoint accuracy on the location of a train - so that more than one can stop and start on any single section of the line without the danger of a crash. The ability to locate the exact position of trains  should make it  easier to manage and increase the flow of Crossrail trains into London. Crossrail, Europe's biggest construction project, is initially scheduled to run 24 trains per hour during peak periods, and it is hoped this will increase to 30. The major issue facing Crossrail is to the west of London, once the track passes through Paddington station. Plan: Crossrail, Europe's biggest construction project, is initially scheduled to run 24 trains an hour during peak periods, although the plan is to increase this to 30 . Industry experts suggest the issue was frustrated by Network Rail separately launching its own 'digital railway' programme last year. This meant introducing advanced technology - such as software that accurately forecasts temperature and rainfall across the UK's major lines. Crossrail has so far involved more than 10,000 construction workers across 40 sites and up to now encountered few problems.","Project is facing humiliation as engineers fail to deal with signal problems .

"Super-sized bottles of cheap cider will be banned in a bid to tackle teenage drinking, under new Labour proposals set to be announced this week. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham wants to outlaw 'high-strength, ultra-low-priced white ciders' sold in three litre bottles. Mr Burnham told MailOnline products like Frosty Jacks, White Ace and White Strike were fuelling under-age binge drinking and alcohol addiction and needed to be tackled. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham wants to outlaw 'high-strength, ultra-low-priced white ciders' sold in three litre bottles . The Labour frontbencher said the high-strength ciders were cheaper than they used to be – meaning children could 'cobble together' enough money to get drunk all nights of the week. He said children as young as '11 or 12' were regularly boozing after school in a way their parents' generation would not have been able to afford. Many ciders available at pocket money prices have an alcohol content of 7.5 per cent – well above the strength of mainstream cider products – costing as little as 20p a unit. He said the cost and strength of cider made it 'very attractive to under-age drinkers, and it is also a major drink of choice for addicts and street drinkers'. Mr Burnham told MailOnline: 'These cider products are particularly used by children because of their low price and high strength. 'We've worked it out at 20p a unit. We're talking about which can be up to 7.5 per cent in strength but are retailing at £1.99 or less – and this is a two or three litre bottle. 'Young people can cobble together the money to get hold of them. Mr Burnham said the proposal was 'the start of the road' for improving public health . 'What we are trying to signal [is that] coming in with a sledgehammer approach and just hitting everybody – that just loses people. They think why is everyone being punished – what's fair about that?' He added that the proposal was 'the start of the road'. But Mr Burnham all-but admitted he had gone boozing with his friends as a teenager. The former health secretary said: 'I think we all grow up, don't we, and we learn as we go. 'I wasn't whiter than white in that respect. I did normal things that teenagers in the North West do.' Mr Burnham pointed to a survey of white cider drinkers by Alcohol Concern which found 50 per cent saying they drank more than three litres a day, and 42 per cent saying they had been drinking it for more than ten years. Mr Burnham is considering banning the sale of cider in bottles of more than one litre in size, or by taxing larger volume cider containers more heavily. The party is also looking at proposals to create a new cheap cider tax to increase the cost of cheap booze. A proposal to increase the minimum apple juice content that cider is required to contain will also be considered. This would increase the cost of producing white cider – forcing up the price in the supermarket. Labour said the ballooning cost of treating alcohol related illnesses meant tackling problem drinking was essential. The harmful use of alcohol costs the NHS in England around £3.5 billion a year and alcohol-related crime costs £11bn per year, the party said. One in five children who drink now consume 15 or more units per week – twice an adult woman's weekly recommended limit. Binge drinkers by 15 are four times more likely to be addicted in later life, and almost half of young people excluded from school in the UK are regular drinkers.","EXCLUSIVE: Labour to ban strong cheap ciders sold in three litre bottles .

"A high school student has revealed how a 'sex-crazed' cross-dressing teacher allegedly took her to nude beaches, sex clubs and luxury hotels during a relationship where he would routinely exploit her. The girl, described only as V.V, said Brooklyn Tech faculty member Sean Shaynak flashed her as they walked to the subway after school and 'plied her with alcohol' during a visit to New York's sex museum. The youngster, who was 18 at the time of the alleged assaults, also said she was forced to 'pray for her life' as she hid in the bushes during a terrifying date with the 44-year-old, who was dressed in drag and screaming 'b****' as he looked for her. During their relationship the father-of-one also took V.V. to a nude section of Jones Beach on Long Island, multiple 'rave clubs,' and X-rated venues where the girl would allegedly watch him 'perform and receive (sex acts) with other males.' A lawsuit seen by the New York Post accused Shaynak of exploiting the girl for his own 'sexual gratification' in a relationship that began when they met at an after-school Aerospace Club. The teacher, who was there when Bill De Blasio's son Dante was a student, is now facing 36 charges from his time at the school, including kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment, and criminal sexual acts against six girls between 2011 and 2014. Busted: Teacher Sean Shaynak, 44, allegedly took advantage of naive young girls as he victimized students before he was finally busted when he sent a photo of his genitals to a 16-year-old student and she showed the photograph to her parents who reported him to the police . According to court documents, Shaynak convinced V.V to go to a DJ party at the Amazura concert hall in Jamaica, Queens. He picked her up at the school, wearing a schoolgirl costume with women's underwear, high-heels and tights. On the way to the venue, the two began arguing about their relationship and Shaynak started yelling in a threatening tone, the lawsuit says. Suddenly, Shaynak stopped the car, turned around, and drove in the opposite direction and allegedly started speeding and driving recklessly through the traffic while 'banging on the steering wheel'. V.V. 'began silently praying for her life while trying to figure out a way to escape.' Shaynak began 'banging on the steering wheel.' Finally, he stopped the car in a dark parking lot in Coney Island, to get out and urinate. The girl then took the opportunity to 'save herself,' by getting out of the car and crawling behind another vehicle to hide. While searching for her, Shaynak shouted 'b****.' She cowered in bushes for up to 40 minutes while Shaynak called and text-messaged her dozens of times, threatening to go to her house and speak to her parents, a lawsuit said. In a statement about Syanak, V.V. who is now a college student said: 'As a teacher, he was very cool to hang out with and talk to. I could totally understand how the other girls could look up to him. 'I feel like I was used. If I had a chance to sit down and talk to him, I would tell him that what he did was sick and he should have stopped when I told him to stop.' Shaynak has pleaded not guilty and remains jailed in Rikers Island. His lawyer, Kimberly Ann Summers, had no comment but in a recent hearing claimed some of the alleged victims 'continue to speak highly of Shaynak. Another student allegedly victimized by Shaynak teacher had lingering affections for him even after he assaulted her, says her heartsick mother. The mother, who remains anonymous as does her daughter, says Shaynak knew the naive girl had fallen for him, a trust he was happy to exploit. 'Sick': Sean Shaynak, 44, allegedly had sex with multiple students at the school where he taught, sent them explicit messages and took them to nude beaches and sex clubs. He has pleaded not guilty . In an interview with The New York Post the mother says he would give her daughter perfect grades even if she turned in unfinished work. 'I raised my children to trust people - but it looks like you can't,' she said. Her daughter, who graduated from high school last year, is now 19, and studying criminal justice in college. She says her first suspicions about Shaynak's appetites came last year when she found him with several bikini-clad female students, her daughter included. He even had his own revealing swimwear. 'The thing that surprised me was the way he laid on the beach,' she said. 'You could see ...everything.' The group was gossiping about sex, with Shaynak holding court about his taste for Russian girls, which her daughter happened to be. 'He was talking about how beautiful Russian girls are and how sexy they are,' the mother said. 'It was scary. 'It was noticeable the way he looked at them and got excited, like he wants somebody, you could tell..' she said. 'When you see a girl and get horny - that's what he was like.' Her daughter later expressed that she had a crush on Shaynak. 'She said, 'Isn't he cute?' I said, 'Yes, he's cute as a man,'' the woman said. 'She said, 'I kind of like him.'' He had allegedly sodomized the girl months earlier in May. 'The judgement for him should be high,' the woman said. 'Because it's children...and it could affect them for the rest of their life. I don't believe he will change. 'He should definitely go to prison for the rest of his life.' On the day after school ended in June, instructor Sean Shaynak allegedly sent the girl a picture of his privates to her cell phone via Snapchat, the girl's angered father told The New York Daily News. The charges in the new indictment include kidnapping, forcible touching, sexual abuse and criminal sexual act. Shaynak faces up to 25 years in prison on the top charge, authorities said. Shaynak, 44, pleaded not guilty in August to charges including dissemination of indecent material to a minor. Authorities say he sent a photo of his genitals to a 16-year-old female student. Authorities said on Tuesday that computers and phones taken after his arrest found text messages, photos and videos detailing sexual interactions with six teens, from ages 13 to 19, between 2011 and 2014. Exclusive: He taught for five years at Brooklyn Technical High School, where Bill de Blasio's son attends school. Shaynak allegedly had relationships with girls ranging in age from 13 to 19, between 2011 and 2014 . Those interactions included taking a 15-year-old girl to a nude beach and giving alcohol and cigarettes to minors, officials said. 'These alleged actions are completely unacceptable and have no place in, or outside of, our schools,' City Department of Education spokeswoman Devora Kaye said. 'The DOE took swift action to immediately reassign Mr. Shaynak following his initial arrest. He is not, and will not be, in contact with students. Student safety remains our top priority.' Brooklyn Tech is one of the most selective high schools in the city. The teacher had allegedly been trying to lure the most recent 16-year-old student who came forward with the text message into an inappropriate relationship for two years. He was considered a 'cool teacher' because he offered to buy her cigarettes. The girl's father said that he also offered to take his daughter to the park and once asked her to pose for him in a project. 'He asked her to pose for him for some kind of a project, and she declined,' the furious father told The New York Daily News on Thursday. 'He wanted to take her to the park. ... We later learned he would buy her cigarettes.' Finally when Shaynak allegedly sent the girl a picture of his crotch, she reported the incident to her parents. The girl's father had a friend in the FBI and they immediately reached out to police. 'It was immediate outrage on my part, 'said her father. 'You can imagine we're all very shaken up and extremely concerned.' The girl took the stand against the teacher two months ago and spoke before a Brooklyn grand jury. He said that while his daughter is strong she is hurt by the incident and it has rattled her trust. 'She likes to play that she's strong and tough ... but then she's my little (girl) all over again asking for my help,' the dad said. 'The main concern is that this guy is off the street and that he stays behind bars and and doesn't have any access to kids.' Sean Shaynak is a divorced dad-of-one who taught math and physics at Brooklyn Technical High School, which is attended by Mayor Bill de Blasio's son Dante. During the investigation into that claim, authorities searched his home, computers and phones and allegedly unearthed thousands of inappropriate text messages, photographs and videos. They allegedly learned that he had had relations with six students, who ranged in age from 13 to 19, between 2011 and 2014, NBC New York reported. 'The defendant, clearly from his actions, looked to groom these students,' assistant district attorney Joseph Mancino said in Brooklyn Supreme Court, the New York Daily News reported. He took one 15-year-old girl to a nude beach in New Jersey without her parents' permission and he also took her to his home, where he plied her with alcohol until she passed out, Mancino said. Shaynak also asked the girl to take part in lesbian sex with another student, prosecutors claim. During a relationship with another girl, he allegedly watched her have sex with other people at a sex club.","Girl known as V.V. said Sean Shaynak would take her to luxury hotels .

"No you're not high. These Ferrari-driving, diamond-wearing businesswomen are the so-called Queens of Cannabis. Cheryl Shuman, 54, entered the world of marijuana in a desperate attempt to treat ovarian, colon and bladder cancer. Seven years later, now in remission, she and her daughter Aimee have become the poster girls for spreading the drug's acceptance across the United States. Aside from numerous strains, they have developed infused brownies, shampoo, and golf shirts. Scroll down for video . Cannabis Queens: Cheryl Shuman (left) and her daughter Aimee (right) are leading California's weed market . And their business, Beverly Hills Cannabis Club, is a favorite among the neighborhood's A-list demographic. 'Growing up, I knew I was going to start a family business,' Cheryl told the New York Times. 'I just didn't know it would be in pot.' The firm's base is a 68-acre farm in Northern California, where medicinal use is legal - and recreational use is expect to be decriminalized in 2016. Shuman's methods have sparked controversy in the activist world as many slam her for hijacking the cause to make a profit and promote herself. It's an allegation she refuses to entertain. 'I can stand on a corner waving a sign, and no disrespect to the people who do that,' she told the Times. 'Or I can go on national television and reach millions of people.' Even her detractors note she has made strides in winning over female supporters - traditionally the hardest nut to crack in the cannabis world. Family business: The duo cater to locals from a 68-acre farm and campaign for the legalization of recreational use in California and across the US. Core members of the movement slam their profit-making methods . Changing conversation: Aimee (pictured) and Cheryl are winning over women, the battleground for cannabis . The female vote will be crucial in the next five years, when a further 14 states are expected to legalize recreational use of the drug. Twenty states including Colorado, Washington and Alaska have passed bills protecting marijuana users. In November, the District of Columbia overwhelmingly voted in favor of decriminalizing the possession and limited cultivation of cannabis. Sights are now set on Nevada, and Shuman plans to lead the movement. Shuman has always been entrepreneurial. The story she tells is a classic rags-to-riches: growing up in rural Ohio, being abandoned by her father, a divorced single mom by 23, and moving to Los Angeles where she lived out of a car with her daughter. As a teenager in Ohio, she created her own coupon business that landed her regular television spot. Celebrity friends: Cheryl, who started with marijuana in 2007, shared this picture with Whoopi Goldberg . Working for an opticians in Hollywood, she made enough celebrity contacts to start her own firm providing glasses for film sets. The next few years were downhill, after Shuman sued former client Steven Seagal for alleged sexual harassment, in a case that was dismissed by a California judge. She married and divorced again, and had another child, and was then diagnosed with cancer. The story has been slammed by core members of the cannabis activism world as a hyperbolic yarn to gain support, investors, and publicity. 'This is typical spinning by Shuman,' rages Steve Bloom, editor of Celeb Stoner. Since joining the cause, Shuman has been ostracized by NORML (The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws) - the group leading the campaign for fresh legislation.

"Charlotte Rampling’s sultry looks and risqué nude scenes helped make her an arthouse star in the 1960s and 1970s. But for her son, Barnaby Southcombe, 42, they only led to years of embarrassment and awkward schoolyard conversations. And, as the actress, 68, returns to screens in the second series of ITV’s Broadchurch, Southcombe has revealed how his own sons have discovered their grandmother’s raunchy past after stumbling across the photos when searching her name online. Charlotte Rampling in her 20s back in 1968, left, and right, with her son Barnaby Southcombe . The film director said his reaction when he was young was: ‘It’s like “Oh god, mum!” she’s at it again. It’s embarrassing at the best of times, but when there’ s someone at school who says their father fancies your mum, that’s weird.’ But he added that his own children, Roman, 12, and Gabriel, 10, who call their grandmother Go-Go because she’s always ‘on the go’, are less worried by the images. He said: ‘They laugh at some pictures when they find them. They’re like “Oh, Go-Go!”’ Miss Rampling, a mother-of-two, stripped has off in 12 movies including 2009’s Life During Wartime when she was 64, and posed for Playboy in 1975. And Southcombe can’t shake off all responsibility for his mother’s racy image, having directed her in a sex scene in his 2012 film I, Anna, something he has previously described as ‘awkward’. He said his mother has always been keen to help woman be proud of their bodies, adding: ‘She’s all about honest. That’s why she’s against Photoshop and plastic surgery. She taught me to be true, honest. I can be proud I guess, in retrospect.’ Miss Rampling, a mother-of-two, returned to screens in the second series of ITV’s Broadchurch . Miss Rampling, who recently became one of the oldest women to model for beauty brand L’Oreal, has previously said there is ‘something creepy’ about with face-lifts. She added: ‘You don’t know what you’re looking at. You think: “Knock, knock!” What’s behind these strange masks? You can’t see the feeling in their faces any more. ‘But if you dare to grow old, there’s something beautiful about it. ‘The creed and the code in Los Angeles is: “Do it!” And if you don’t do it, you’re a renegade. And if you’re a renegade there, where do you go? Europe, I suppose.’ Miss Rampling seems set to keep her clothes on in her latest role as mysterious QC Jocelyn Knight in Broadchurch. The show was welcomed back to screens last week by 7.2million viewers after nearly two years away. As the formidable lawyer, the actress looks set to prosecute accused murder Joe Miller after his shocking not guilty plea in last week’s episode and will face-off in the court room against a former colleague played by Oscar-nominee Marianne Jean-Baptiste.","Charlotte Rampling’s sultry looks helped make her an arthouse star .

"Pope Francis told new mothers they should feel to breastfeed during a ceremony to baptise 33 infants in the Sistine Chapel on Sunday. 'You mothers give your children milk and even now, if they cry because they are hungry, breastfeed them, don't worry,' he said, departing from his prepared text. The written text of his homily had the phrase 'give them milk,' but he changed it to use the Italian term 'allattateli', which means 'breastfeed them,' and added that they should not hesitate. Welcome to the Catholic church: Pope Francis tips holy water on to the forehead of a baby during a mass baptism in Rome on Sunday . 'Breastfeed them': The pope surprised observers by urging mothers of restive infants to give them some milk . As the room famous for Michelangelo's frescoes echoed with the cries of the 20 girls and 13 boys, Francis asked the congregation to remember poor mothers around the world, 'too many ... who can't give food to their children'. Even before he read the homily, at least one mother was seen breastfeeding, perhaps recalling that the pope had used similar words to make mothers feel at ease before. Baptism is the sacrament at which infants or converts are initiated into the Christian faith. Francis poured water on the foreheads of the infants as part of the ritual. Francis spoke each baby's name and poured water from a golden shell-shaped cup into their foreheads, welcoming them into their religion - despite the apparent protestations of some. 'Teach your children that you can not be a Christian outside the Church, you can not follow Jesus Christ without the Church, because the Church is mother, and makes us grow in love for Jesus Christ,' he counselled parents. He also urged the parents - who were all Vatican employees - to make a good example to the young initiates by reading the Gospel on a daily basis. 'Always carry a small Gospel in your pocket, purse, to read it,' Francis said. 'And this will be an example to the children, to see dad, mum, godparents, grandfather, grandmother, uncles, read the Word of God.' Charity: Francis asked the congregation to remember poor mothers around the world, 'too many ... who can't give food to their children' Piety: He also urged the parents to make a good example to the young initiates by reading the Gospel on a daily basis . For the first time in his pontificate, Francis celebrated Mass with his back to the faithful, according to the rites before the modernising reforms of the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s. It did not appear to be a theological statement by the pope, who has made clear he doesn't particularly care for the pre-Vatican II Latin Mass rites, but rather in deference to the original layout of the Sistine Chapel where priests traditionally face away from the congregation. Francis gave Mass as part of the celebration of the Baptism of the Lord, the Christian feast which commemorates the baptism of Jesus in the Jordan River by John the Baptist. The annual ceremony, marking the end of the Christmas season, is held the first Sunday after the January 6 Epiphany. 'You can not follow Jesus Christ without the Church,' the pope said during the ceremony to celebrate the feast of the Baptism of the Lord . Thirty-three, the number of babies Francis baptised, is believed to be the age of Jesus at the time of the crucifixion and resurrection. In the Bible, some experts say, it is connected to the promises of God. The 33rd time Noah's name is used in the Bible is when God makes a convenant with him not to destroy the entire world with a flood again, according to biblestudy.org. On the 33rd mention of Abraham's name, Isaac, a child of promise, is born. Thirty-three is also the number of divisions on the globe as seen on the UN flag. The Sistine Chapel, which Michelangelo painted in the 16th century, is the room where cardinals elect popes in secret conclaves. Francis was elected the first non-European pope in 1,300 years there on March 13, 2013.","Pope Francis has previously urged nursing mothers to feel comfortable breastfeeding during church services .

"A Chinese farmer who lit up a cigarette on board a flight to Bangkok claimed he had no idea that smoking on a plane was illegal. Xu Miaoqing, 61, from mainland China, told a court he was illiterate and was unable to read the no smoking signs. Mr Miaoqing had been caught smoking in the toilet on the Cathay Pacific flight on Christmas Day by flight attendants. Mr Miaoqing, 61, made headlines after being caught smoking in the toilet on the Cathay Pacific flight on Christmas Day . He had been given the ‘free trip’ as a present. However, he has since been hit with a HK$2,000 (£170) fine after pleading guilty in Tsuen Wan Court in Hong Kong to a charge of smoking in an aircraft. In addition to the fine, the court heard that the case had cost Xu dear. He had to give up his travel documents during the investigation and the period he had spent in Hong Kong had cost the man a quarter of his income for the year. His holiday was meant to be free - a gift from his niece. The court heard that a steward on flight CX708 went to the toilet cubicle after an alarm sounded. Mr Miaoqing lit up a cigarette on board a flight to Bangkok claiming he had no idea that smoking on a plane was illegal . Xu was inside and there was a strong smell of smoke. A cigarette butt was found in the toilet. On arrival, he admitted to police that he had been smoking. Xu's case is the latest in a series of incidents involving misbehaviour by mainland air passengers. Last month, a Nanjing-bound flight turned back to Bangkok after a flight a passenger scalded a flight attendant with hot water from instant noodles. Another threatened to bomb the plane in a row over seating. They were later banned from travelling by provincial authorities. Days later, a passenger on a Xiamen Air flight from Hangzhou to Chengdu yanked open a door shortly before take-off to ‘get some fresh air’. There was another brawl on a Hong Kong-bound flight from Chongqing over a crying baby.","Xu Miaoqing, 61, was caught smoking in the toilet of a Cathay Pacific flight .

"A mother-of-three who was fatally injured in a horse-riding accident, had been thrown from her trap after the pony was spooked by a herd of cows, an inquest heard. Genevieve 'Gen' Palecek from Rushden, Northamptonshire suffered a fractured neck and 'unsurvivable' head injuries when she was hurled into a stone wall as the trap hit a tree. Before her tragic death, the 56-year-old had posted dozens of photos of herself riding her pony Martha on her Facebook page. Accident: Genevieve 'Gen' Palecek , 56, from, pictured on her horse Tom, suffered 'unsurvivable' neck and head injuries when she was thrown from a trap after her pony was spooked . One picture shows Martha harnessed up to the trap which has an 'L' plate on it and the caption 'My clever girlie'. Under another, Ms Palecek, a care home nurse, has commented: 'She actually prefers driving to being ridden. Martha is going so well, I just love taking her out.' Friend Rebecca Storr told the inquest at Ampthill, Bedfordshire, how she had gone out with her friend for a ride round Podington, near Wellingborough, Northants, on July 14 last year. As they trotted at walking speed towards a herd of cows mooing at them over a hedge, Ms Palecek joked: 'I don't know whether she is all right with cows.. But we'll find out in a minute.' Rebecca said Ms Palecek then asked her to dismount from the trap just in case of problems because Martha, who was wearing blinkers, had 'stiffened up'. Tragedy: Ms Palecek's pony Martha, pictured, was spooked by some cows and  she was hurled into a stone wall as the trap hit a tree . The mother-of-two was a keen horsewoman and posted several pictured of herself in the saddle online . But as she stepped on to the road, the horse suddenly began kicking against the cart as if the cows had 'spooked' her. Rebecca added: 'Then she reared up on her back legs and started galloping forwards. I started to run after the trap but couldn't keep up. 'As they neared a bend in the road, I could hear Gen shouting ""Martha, Martha"", but the horse reared right and Gen was thrown to the left. Then the trap was being dragged along on its side. 'By the time I reached Gen, who was still wearing a riding hat, she was lying unconscious on the ground and breathing shallowly.' Ms Palecek was airlifted to University Hospital, Coventry, where doctors found she had 'unsurvivable injuries'. As  there were no transplant teams free to remove her organs, relatives agreed that she should be kept alive until the next day. Doctors kept Ms Palecek alive for another 24 hours so her liver and kidneys could be donated to other people. Assistant coroner Ian Pears thanked her family for their thoughtfulness when he offered them his condolences at the inquest, recording a verdict of accidental death.","Genevieve 'Gen' Palecek died after suffering 'unsurvivable' injuries .

"Kim Major, 48, claims she has been handed a 'death sentence' after doctors failed to spot she had cancer 25 times . A mother-of-two claims she has been handed a 'death sentence' after doctors failed to spot she had cancer 25 times – and even advised her to see a psychiatrist for her 'anxiety'. Kim Major, 48, has now launched a medical negligence lawsuit against the surgery, claiming the year-long delay in diagnosing her terminal lung cancer left her with just six months to live. She has now been told she's unlikely to spend another Christmas with her son Lewis, 13, and daughter Roxanne, 31, because the tumours have spread from her lungs to her brain and liver. During one visit to Fitznells Manor Surgery in Epsom, Surrey, she was turned away and told she had a virus and on another occasion she was advised to see a psychiatrist for her 'anxiety'. 'I just feel totally abandoned by the people I should have been able to trust to care for me. It's just so awful for the family, it's ripped our hearts out,' she told the Sunday Mirror. 'I could not believe what I was hearing when I was told I had lung cancer but to make matters worse it had been left undiagnosed for long it had spread to my lymph nodes and to my brain.' 'Each day I'm grateful to wake up. My son thinks chemotherapy is going to mend me. 'But I know the medicine might let me down. It's heart-breaking to tell your children you might not be here next year. I feel like I've been given a death sentence.' She first visited the surgery in September 2013 complaining of recurring headaches, dizziness, coughing, chest and neck pain. It was only when the 48-year-old had X-rays and blood tests in A&E after struggling to breathe that she discovered she had terminal lung cancer. Doctors found a tumour on her lung, two tumours in her brain and two in her liver. 'I do not know how long I have left but my condition is deteriorating and I am worried for my son who will be left without his mum,' she said. She has now been told she's unlikely to spend another Christmas with her son Lewis, 13, (left) and daughter Roxanne, 31, (right) because the tumours have spread from her lungs to her brain and liver . 'I am struggling to come to terms with my diagnosis and what the future has in store for me.' Her lawyer Richard Kayser, from Irwin Mitchell Solicitors, said: 'Kim's diagnosis has come as a complete shock to her and her family and they are desperately seeking answers as to why her condition was not picked up at an earlier point.' A spokesman for Fitznells Manor Surgery said: 'The surgery was saddened to hear of this case and our thoughts go to the family. Due to patient confidentiality, we are unable to comment further.' An NHS England Surrey and Sussex spokesman said it would be 'inappropriate to comment further due to legal proceedings'.

"One in five people who bought their council home in one of Britain’s wealthiest areas was receiving housing benefit when they applied, it has emerged. The revelation centres on the London borough of Westminster, and comes after a Government watchdog warned fraudulent purchases under the Right to Buy scheme have increased 400 per cent in two years. One fear is that hard-up tenants are being ‘gifted’ cash by private firms to buy their homes at a cut-price rate. Scroll down for video . The revelation centres on the London borough of Westminster, and comes after a Government watchdog warned fraudulent purchases under the Right to Buy scheme have increased 400 per cent in two years . After buying a property, the company can then sell them on to private landlords for a profit, who will let them at market value. In Westminster, 22 per cent of Right to Buy sales were to people in receipt of housing benefit when they applied, dropping to 11 per cent upon completion. It begs the question of how council tenants who qualify for housing benefit could suddenly afford to buy properties outright in one of the most expensive parts of the country. Anyone who has more than £16,000 in savings is not eligible for housing benefit. A report also found that 31 per cent of former council homes are now owned by private landlords and can be let for more than £800 a week in the capital’s second-most expensive borough. Councillors have warned of a ‘property bonanza’ – and said many tenants claim the money was a gift from overseas, making it near impossible to trace. Last summer, it emerged that a property company had leafleted 60,000 council house tenants offering six-figure rewards for working with them to buy and then sell their homes. Councillor Lindsey Hall, anti-fraud tsar for Tory-run Westminster, believes Right to Buy should stay . Nicholas Carlino, a director of London Investment Property Group, told an undercover Sunday Times reporter that he was making so much money snapping up homes that had been undervalued by the council and selling them on that he would ‘never have to work again’. The scheme was entirely legal. Councillor Lindsey Hall, anti-fraud tsar for Tory-run Westminster, told BBC London’s Inside Out programme: ‘I passionately believe Right to Buy needs to stay, but it needs to be very tightly managed and not fuelling a property bonanza for individuals swanning around estates in grand Mercedes and BMWs.’ Labour-run Islington council said Right to Buy sales had risen from only a handful to more than 300 since tenants’ discounts were increased two years ago. In some cases, discounts now amount to more than £100,000. Councillor James Murray told the programme: ‘It’s hard – we build them and then lose them via Right to Buy which then becomes buy to let.’ Right to Buy was first launched by Margaret Thatcher in 1980 to help council tenants get on the property ladder. In March 2012, the Government announced it would ‘reinvigorate’ the policy, raising the cap on discounts and ensuring that new council homes were built. But an Audit Commission report last year found Right to Buy fraud had increased by more than 400 per cent since the reforms. Westminster said it now refers all Right to Buy applications from tenants on housing benefit to be checked for fraud.

"A couple who bought a micro-pig were stunned when their pint-sized family pet turned into a 670lb giant. Steve Jenkins and Derek Walter from Ontario, Canada, adopted Esther thinking she would only grow to around 70lb, a respectable five stone. But they were tricked and two-year-old Esther has not stopped growing and is now heavier than a fully-grown female polar bear. Scroll down for video . Steve Jenkins and Derek Walter's pig Esther basks in a nest of stolen blankets on the living room floor . Feedling time! Vast Esther joins Steve and Derek's two pet dogs for a bite to eat in the farm kitchen . The couple adopted Esther after a friend who described her as a 'micro-pig' - she's now the size of a polar bear . The two-year-old sow, who is toilet-trained, is now nearly ten times her expected size. She eats £30 of vegan food each week, enjoying a diet of rolled oats, barley and corn as well as fresh fruit and vegetables like over ripe bananas and vegetable peelings. She has become so big that the couple had to move into a farm to create enough room for her and their two dogs and a cat. Steve, who works in the property industry, said: 'We lived in denial for a long-time. Friends would come over and say 'she's getting bigger' and Derek and I would say 'no she's not'. 'But soon she was standing up to steal things off the kitchen counters, the couch became smaller, and of course there was the weight gain. 'We just adapted and loved her more. What else could we do? It wasn't her fault and we would never give up a pet.' As Esther the Wonder Pig, the giant porker has more than 230,000 friends on Facebook . Her antics, such as playing in the snow in Canada's freezing winter, has earned her legions of fans online .

The couple who've moved into a farm, say Esther has changed their lives and they 'love her more' Steve said: 'Since we moved to the farm she has decided she needs to be close to us and now sleeps beside our bed with her mattress on the floor. 'She still on occasion climbs up on to our bed for a nap during the day.' Esther has now found fame on Facebook as Esther the Wonder Pig and has more than 230,000 friends who follow updates on their her exploits. Derek and Steve post pictures and video of the pig and sell calendars, postcards and mugs featuring the pink porker. Esther basks outside where she spends much of the day rooting around - in between her vegan meals . The pink pig stays pristine with regular baths and her owners say she's used to being fussed over . The sow has a vegan diet and scoffs a range of dishes such as pizza, ripe bananas, vegetable peel and oats . Followers can watch her snoozing in a nest of stolen blankets, monopolising the sofa - as well as the dog bed - or sprawling across the living room floor leaving little  room for anyone else. The pair have now created another Facebook page, Esther's Kitchen, to feature the vegan food they prepare for their rambunctious pet, including spinach lasagne and chocolate chip granola bites. Speaking about Esther's online popularity, Steve added: 'It is still surreal and absolutely mind-boggling. 'We started Esther's page just as a way for immediate friends and family to stay in touch with us and Esther's antics. The sheer size of the toilet-trained pig dwarfs the furniture in Derek and Steve's farmhouse . Esther joins in when guests come round for tea and her owners say people treat her like royalty . The porker clearly loves to eat and gets through £30 of fruit, vegetables and grains each week . 'But one of those friends shared Esther's page on an animal-related website and the next thing we knew Esther's page had 10,000 likes and it never stopped. 'Derek and I are Esther's voice and some days it is really challenging to come up with new quips and I will sit there staring at a picture until something comes to me. 'Other days it's as if I can read Esther's thoughts and I swear she can convey them with her eyes and her smile.

'It is as if she knows she is famous and that is her role, that she is changing the world's view of her kind and their amazing abilities to think, feel and be loved.'

"Latest arrest: This is George Zimmerman's mugshot from the Seminole Sheriff's Office in Florida after his arrest on Friday night for assault and domestic violence with a weapon . Following his recent arrest for allegedly throwing a wine bottle at his girlfriend, George Zimmerman's lawyer has admitted his client 'has not been lucky with the ladies.' Zimmerman, whose acquittal of murdering an unarmed black teen sparked a national debate on race and self-defense laws, was arrested for aggravated assault in Lake Mary about 10 p.m. Friday and is being held at the John E. Polk Correctional Facility. His attorney, Don West, said the incident involved the 31-year-old allegedly tossing a wine bottle at his girlfriend earlier this week at his Lake Mary home. West said he did not want to 'speculate' about the situation that led to the alleged assault, reports NBC. During a court appearance Saturday morning, Zimmerman's bond was set at $5,000 and he was ordered to avoid contact with the woman who was not identified. Judge John Galluzzo gave few details of the incident, but said a wine bottle was involved and that the alleged assault happened at Zimmerman's home. Prosecutors questioned whether substance abuse treatment was needed, but the judge said that didn't seem to be a factor. It is not known at this time who the girlfriend is but Zimmerman was known to be living with Samantha Scheibe earlier this year. Police arrested Zimmerman after his girlfriend told them about the row when they pulled her over for a routine traffic stop. Zimmerman was also told by the judge to stay out of Volusia County, where the alleged woman lives. The judge ordered Zimmerman to pack up any personal belongings his girlfriend may have left at Zimmerman's home and give them to his lawyer. Scroll Down for Video .

It will be the first of many roles for her.’ He praised her for not trying to use her fame to secure roles, saying: ‘She is not taking advantage of any media profile.’ Tulip Fever, adapted by Sir Tom Stoppard from the novel by Deborah Moggach, is set in the 17th century and sees an artist fall in love with a young woman after her husband commissions him to paint her portrait. Miss Bonas plays Mrs Steen, the young wife of a merchant. Earlier she dazzled in white at a BAFTA Tea Party, joining Cara Delevingne, Keira Knightley and the ladies of hit TV show Downton Abbey as they partied in the sunshine town.

"They always say hemlines rise with the stock market, so the return of the short skirt on the High Street, the catwalk and celebrities everywhere must be a cracking good sign for the economy. A good thing, too: they’re fun, fashionable and feminine. The only thing is that dealing with a deficit of skirt fabric is no easy matter — especially when, like me, you’re over 40 and a mum of three. There’s the key ‘how short is too short?’ question (depends on height and leg shape) and the issues of cut, colour and fabric. Of course, the dangers are manifold. You definitely don’t want to go so short that you become a ‘1661’ (those who look 16 from the back, but 61 from the front) or become a walking advertisement for your mid-life crisis. Here, we pick from the crop of High Street offerings to see which are short and sweet — and which should be given short shrift. Scroll down for video . LOVELY LEATHER . Leather skirt, £153, tedbaker.com . Shirt, £54.95, massimodutti.com . Black courts, £65, dunelondon.com . I thought leather and short would turn a mid-life crisis into a catastrophe.

Jigsaw skirt, £68, johnlewis.co.uk . Burgundy blouse, £35, marksandspencer.com . Shoes, £149, reiss.com . This jewel-toned A- line skirt is a lovely cut, lined with a concealed zip.

"Senior MPs have called for Prince Andrew to stay away from a business conference in Switzerland amid controversy about his friendship with billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. The prince usually attends the World Economic Forum in Davos, hosting private receptions and meetings. But he is in the spotlight over toxic claims – which he has emphatically denied – that he had sexual relations with an under-age girl linked to Epstein. Sir Menzies Campbell has suggested he may not be welcome at this year's conference, which runs from January 21 to 25. 'This is a time for discretion rather than distraction,' said the former Lib Dem leader. Katy Clark, Willie Bain and Ann McKechin, Labour MPs on the House of Commons business committee, are also said to have suggested he should stay away. Former Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell (left) is among senior politicians saying Prince Andrew's (right0 presence at conference would be a distraction . Meanwhile, other MPs have called for clarification over his globe-trotting to promote British business – and how it is funded. The prince was forced to step down as an international trade envoy in 2011 after criticism that he was lavishing millions of pounds of public money on private jets and helicopters. His resignation also came after photographs emerged of the prince and Epstein walking together in New York after the financier had been released from jail for grooming under-age girls for sex. But despite losing his envoy title, Andrew still travels around the world promoting British business and undertook 90 overseas trips last year, including to India, Saudi Arabia, and China. While some of this travel costs were met by the taxpayer, other trips were in a private capacity, raising questions as to who is funding the prince. The royal is in the spotlight over toxic claims – which he has emphatically denied – that he had sexual relations with Virginia Roberts, then 17, pictured (centre) with Ghislaine Maxwell (right) Yesterday, Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi said Prince Andrew did an excellent job of promoting British business through his contacts and should not be discouraged from attending Davos. He said: 'It is a very important job. When I have spoken to ambassadors for the Middle East and elsewhere in the world, they say that what he does for UK Plc is invaluable. 'If it is true Labour MPs are calling for him not to attend, then it is trial by Labour. 'The palace has said he has done nothing wrong and have categorically denied the allegations.' Royal aides have previously said that his trips to Davos are 'an opportunity to engage with and learn from some of the biggest names in the global economy'. They said he also uses the event to encourage chief executives to help young people acquire skills through apprenticeships and mentoring.

"A grown man who has spent thousands feeding his My Little Pony obsession loves dressing up as the make-believe horses. Rob Harrison, 34, from Vancouver in British Columbia, Canada, is part of a legion of male fans who openly adore the cartoon - a group so large they even have their own nickname 'bronies', from 'bro' and 'pony'. He loves watching characters such as Twilight Sparkle, Fluttershy and Applejack cantering across his screen every week. Scroll down for video . Rob first became a fan of the show in 2013 after being asked to help at BronyCAN . The IT consultant has filled his home with memorabilia from plush toys to full body costumes he and his fellow bronies wear to conventions. Rob, who is currently single, admits he knows people will laugh at his obsession but insists it doesn't bother him. He said: 'I always knew people were interested in the show - I was kind of ignoring it because thought it was a show for girls. 'But I was ignorant. It wasn't until after I watched it I realised they were going for more general focus. 'I've been into cartoons for as long as I can remember. I have so much in my apartment my friends and family aren't surprised any more. 'I just roll with it. If people try to make me look bad and get a laugh then I gave them a laugh they didn't have.

He added: 'I met a bunch of people in the community and realised they were a lot of fun to be around. 'Plus it turned out I liked the material more than I thought I would. The show was fun but the whole package is what sealed the deal. 'A lot of meet-ups are drinking parties - people don't realise as this is an internet community. 'But we all found this weird thing online so why not get together and have fun. 'I do travel for it. Seattle, USA, is the furthest I've been but there is one in the UK and Germany too for example. 'It seems like there are more and more brony conventions popping up every single month.' Ironically, Rob says even though an ex-girlfriend attempted to convert him he never liked My Little Pony. He says if he met a girl and she wanted him to give it up - then he could . But now he has taken to the show he insists it doesn't stop him meeting other women. He said: 'I used to make fun of my ex for it - but she must have shown me a few episodes I didn't like. 'It was a surprise I ended up getting into it. If I met another girl and she wanted me to give it up then I could as it's an interest not a lifestyle. 'However if someone were to ask me to give up a piece of myself I wouldn't want to be with them anyway.' Rob admits he knows people will laugh at his obsession but insists is doesn't bother him .

A black and white McLaren P1 (pictured) is being sold at a Hertfordshire showroom for £400,000 more than when it was new . The McLaren P1 - described by Autoweek as 'possibly the most exciting road car ever built' - is one of only 375 ever made . The supercar is powered by a 3.8litre twin-turbo V8 engine and can hit 124mph in under seven seconds and 190 in under 17 . The McLaren P1 - described by Autoweek as 'possibly the most exciting road car ever built' - can hit 124mph in under seven seconds and 190mph in under 17. It is powered by a 3.8litre twin-turbo V8 engine and linked to a dual clutch seven-speed F1 style racing gearbox, which is equivalent to nine Ford Fiestas. The engine set-up promises 'instantaneous throttle response', according to McLaren. Car-mad comedy actor Rowan Atkinson was reported to be after one of the cars when it was released having secured a £910,000 insurance pay-out to restore his McLaren F1 after he crashed it. The McLaren P1 on sale is a white and black model with only 21 miles on the clock. James Cottingham, from DK Engineering, said: 'When you have a limited supply and a really good car, you will often see a premium. 'We have seen it with the Ferrari Enzo, the Pagani Zonda and now we are seeing it with the McLaren P1. 'Just like with the Enzo and Zondas, the P1 is a truly rare car with less than 400 being built. 'It is a stunning piece of kit and very much a real supercar. I believe this is the first P1 to be sold in the UK and it only has delivery miles. 'We have had a lot of interest in it and we expect a buyer soon.' The P1 was officially launched in Geneva in 2013 and is regarded as one of the great British cars - a second-hand model is available to buy . The car - which was sold new for £866,000 - is being sold at DK Engineering in Hertfordshire for £1.25million . The car was launched officially at the Geneva Motor Show on March 5 2013, with the first deliveries in September to coincide with McLaren's 50th anniversary. The P1 features Formula 1-derived race technology which the company says increases speed and acceleration. It has an 'instant power assist system' that propels the car, rocket-like, from rest to 190mph in under 17 seconds – more than 35 per cent faster than even the F1. It also has lightweight batteries behind the driver store charge generated by the petrol engine but a plug-in charger can also be used to boost energy levels from empty to full in two hours. As a result the car produces zero emissions when running on electric power only and has a range of 12.5miles at an average city speed of 30mph. The supercar has a top speed of 217mph, with McLaren claiming it can lap the notorious Nurburgring race track in less than seven minutes . It has alcantara seats, dash, door inserts, steering wheel and sun visors while a number of exterior parts have a carbon fibre finish .

"Career criminal Noel 'Razor' Smith, who has 58 convictions and spent 32 years in prison, believes the current system is failing . Are prisons working? At a time of high re-offending rates, a surge in violence and suicides and a steady rise in prison populations, many have suggested Britain's prisons are in crisis. Career criminal Noel 'Razor' Smith, who has 58 convictions and spent 32 years in prison is well-placed to comment on the issue. The grandfather-of-six was first arrested aged 14 for stealing apples. From there he 'threw himself into a life of crime' becoming a professional robber and committing more than 200 bank robberies. As he described it: 'I loved being a criminal, it was a buzz being out there on the sharp end, gun in hand, masked and taking the prize.' Smith spent time inside 34 different prisons, including the notoriously tough Whitemoor where he was locked up with infamous murderers such as police killer Harry Roberts, who was released last November after 48 years behind bars. He was also imprisoned at Belmarsh where he struck up an unlikely friendship with shamed MP Jonathan Aitken and took him under his wing – or as he said 'I stopped some of the others stripping him down naked and humiliating him.' He finally turned away from a life of crime after spending five years at HMP Grendon, a voluntary prison that provides a regime of therapy. Having spent the majority of his adult life in prison, he believes the current system is failing. He said: 'I would raise it to the ground and start again. The problem is they are not rehabilitating anyone in prison at the moment. 'Prison should only be for the very dangerous, which is about 5,000 to 6,000 people of the 89,000-odd people in prison. As it is, there are people being locked up who don't need to be there taking up spaces and wasting money. 'For example many people go to prison who have drink and drug problems, but they are not a danger to the public and they should be dealt with in hospitals. Similarly about 15 per cent of prisoners are homeless and it's often not their fault they end up in prison. 'But the policy at the moment is to send everyone to prison. They want to build new prisons but that sends out the message they want to invest in the future criminality of our children. They should be looking at reducing the number of prison populations.' Smith spent time inside 34 different prisons, including the notoriously tough high security Whitemoor prison . He was in prison with notorious criminals such as shamed MP Jonathan Aitken (left) and Harry Roberts (right) The seasoned criminal said the way to reduce the re-offending problem is to give prisoners proper vocational and educational training as an incentive to move on with their life after prison. At present, 46 per cent of adults are re-convicted within one year of release. 'There is such a high re-offending rate because in prison people do nothing with you. Most of the recent violence and disturbance has been because there's no work and prisoners are locked up for 23 hours a day. 'If I was in charge I would make sure prisoners had vocational training and some form of education, so they have something to do when they get out of prison. Lots of people come in to prison without being able to read and write and when they are released that is still the case. That isn't right. 'Also when people leave prison there is no after care and they are given £46 which is expected to last them for four to five weeks. 'It is a culture shock for people coming out who have served long sentences. It's a great feeling of relief when you are released but after a few weeks it can be depressing and you're left on your own.' He believes the use of therapy at Grendon is the most successful way of preventing prisoners from spiralling back into a life of crime. Grendon is the prison with the lowest re-conviction rate in the UK. Smith in the early 1980s with his son Joseph, who was found hanged in an alley - following his son's death, he applied to HMP Grendon and believed the therapy at the prison helped him turn away from a life of crime . Smith decided to apply for Grendon after his 19-year-old son Joseph hanged himself. At that time he was in Whitemoor prison and had become an 'elite career criminal' surrounded by high profile 'lifers'. But because he was deemed such a danger to the public, he was prevented from attending the funeral and felt he had let his family down. It was at that moment, he started to look for rehabilitation and moved to Grendon, where he spent the next five years. He said: 'Grendon works because it treats people's problems unlike the other prisons when the prisoners are just locked away. They treat people with respect and there was a programme of therapy every day. The main thing they tried to instil in you was victim empathy.' But what of the argument that a tough approach should help put prisoners back on the straight and narrow? Surely if prison is a tough and inhospitable regime, convicts will be determined to never re-offend? Smith disagrees. 'My first experience of prison was in the 1970s when I was put in a 'shock' detention centre for those under 17. They decided that the way to stop young people re-offending was to brutalise them so badly they never wanted to go back to being a prisoner. 'This tactic may have worked if it was used for about 10 days, but I had it for six months which just made me think not to respect authority. 'It is similar problem nowadays where they are making sentences longer and longer, which removes the shock factor. People can get used to anything as it becomes the norm. It's terrifying for about four or five weeks.' HMP Grendon (pictured) is the prison with the lowest re-conviction rate in the United Kingdom . Smith also takes a somewhat controversial stance when it comes to drugs in prisons – a problem common to all UK prisons. He is sceptical about the policy of mandatory testing, introduced by Michael Howard in 1995. He believes the testing - while initially helping to tackle the problem - in the long-term has meant more prisoners now take heroin instead of cannabis. He said: 'When the testing came in, people started taking heroin because it got out of the bloodstream much quicker. 'After a test people also knew they had a clear run of days when they could use it without being caught.' He also explained how prisoners found ways to avoid being tested positive, such as drinking three litres of water before a test to flush the drug away from their bloodstream or keeping a little bag of urine down their trousers. When he was locked up in Whitemoor prison, Smith forged a relationship with Jonathan Aitken, so what is his view of another high profile criminal, Ched Evans' efforts to return to football? Despite stressing the importance of prisoners getting back into work, he does not believe Evans deserves his return to the game. His planned move to Oldham fell through this week following threats to the club's 'staff and families'. 'Prisoners aren't allowed out of jail unless they do re-offending courses. Part of the re-offending process is admitting to the crime you have committed and knowing you have done wrong. 'Ched Evans has served half his sentence and still shows no remorse for what he has done. He may think he is not guilty but as it stands he is still a convicted rapist and what's to stop him doing it again?' - Between 1993 and 2012, the prison population in England and Wales more than doubled: rising from 41,800 to over 86,000. - Prison has a very poor record for reducing re-offending – 46 per cent of adults are reconvicted within one year of release. - Overcrowding is getting steadily worse: 77 of 119 prisons in England and Wales are now overcrowded. - In 2000 there were 2.9 prisoners for each prison officer, but by 2013, it had increased to 4.8 prisoners for each prison officer. - The National Offender Management Service, the agency responsible for running prisons, has to make savings of almost 25 per cent by 2014-15. - In 2012, 47 per cent of prisoners reported they had no qualifications, and 15 per cent reported being homeless before custody. - In the last 20 months, 125 prisoners have killed themselves in British prisons.","Exclusive: Former con Noel 'Razor' Smith says prison system is failing .

"Hospitals have been forced to lock toys to cots with bicycle locks after a spate of thefts from children's wards. Father-of-four Dean Beddis, 49, discovered that toys were chained to the cots when he was with his two year-old-son Soren at Newport's Royal Gwent Hospital. Doctors were treating Soren for bronchiolitis - a chest infection that affects babies - on the Bluebell Ward in the hospital. But when the two-year-old tried to play with a musical toy on his cot he found it was locked up. Two-year-old Soren had to play with a doughnut-shaped toy chained to a cot with a bike lock - the Royal Gwent Hospital, in Newport, said it had to lock up its toys because of a spate of thefts in the wards . Mr Beddis, who runs Newport's Kriminal Records in the town's market, said: 'These toys are there for kids who are seriously ill. 'They're provided by the hospital and people are stealing them. I was shocked to see that a children's toy had a bike lock on it attaching it to the cot. 'I was talking to the nurses about how disgusting it was that they had to do that because they were saying people had been stealing them.' He also discovered that electrical goods had been stolen from the hospital. 'People had also been stealing TVs from the parents' waiting room in the children's ward,' he said. 'There was no TV there when I was last there because it had been stolen. 'Going onto a ward and stealing toys while the hospital staff are looking after their children is a sad reflection on society.' Doctors were treating Soren for bronchiolitis - a chest infection that affects babies - on the Bluebell Ward in Newport's Royal Gwent Hospital (pictured) when he had to play with the chained up toy . Staff went on to tell him thieves were also stealing valuable medical equipment. He said: 'They even had people stealing doctor's things while they were in surgery - taking clothes and all the rest of it, whether that be valuables or otherwise.' Aneurin Bevan University Health Board runs 14 hospitals covering Blaenau Gwent, Caerphilly, Monmouthshire, Newport, Torfaen and southern Powys. 'Unfortunately we do get toys and games taken from our hospitals,' a spokesman said. 'It is not a regular occurrence but we do encourage staff to secure and lock away some of the more popular and more expensive items. 'As with any large buildings open to the public we advise visitors and our own staff to be vigilant with valuables. Our hospitals have full CCTV coverage and security on site at all times.' This is not the first time children's toys have been targeted in hospitals. In April last year, thousands of pounds worth of toys donated to sick children at Great Ormond Street Children's Hospitals were stolen. Gadgets and goods including a Nintendo Wii, iPads, board games, phones, shoes, and cash were taken from Britain's largest hospital for unwell children.","Dean Beddis, 49, found toys chained to cots when at hospital with his son .

"Members of the Muslim community feel they were set up by police who contacted them asking for an ISIS flag during the Sydney siege, a prominent activist says. Rebecca Kay, who converted to Islam and is now a well-known and outspoken community member, was called by an officer from NSW Police Counter-Terrorism about four hours after Man Haron Monis took 18 hostages in the Lindt café in Martin Place on December 15. The officer said Monis was demanding an ISIS flag and asked Ms Kay to help police find one, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. Scroll down for video . Activist and Muslim convert Rebecca Kay tried to help police find an ISIS flag during the Sydney siege . Hostages were forced to hold an Islamic Shahada flag while gunman Man Haron Monis demanded an ISIS flag . She agreed to make phone calls even though she knew it would be a difficult task finding someone willing to admit they owned a flag relating to the terrorist group. 'A lot of people in the Muslim community were devastated. We were ready to jump – ""just say how high"" – to help police prevent a tragedy,' Ms Kay said. Ms Kay said the officer called her back multiple times requesting she get an ISIS flag to Bankstown Police Station so it could be taken to downtown Sydney in a patrol car. But Ms Kay said the situation compromised her relationships with some people she contacted, who were suspicious about her request and accused her of being a police informant. Ms Kay said Police police searched the homes of men who were contacted by people trying to find a flag . The next day police searched the house of one young man she spoke to who said he had a flag but decided not to hand it over. Police also searched the homes of two other men who were contacted. 'Obviously, they were listening to all our phone calls,' Ms Kay said. 'I want to be able to have dealings with police, but when it gets thrown back in your face, it sets us back two steps.' Counter-terrorism police also contacted Sydney man and onetime terror accused Zaky Mallah and asked him for an ISIS flag. Mr Mallah, 30, from Westmead in western Sydney offered the Counter Terrorist police the flag that hangs on the wall of his apartment, the moderate Islamic Front flag, but 'they weren't interested'. A Kurdish fighter holds up an ISIS flag in Kobane, Syria in December 2014 . A member loyal to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) waves an ISIL flag in Raqqa . Police eventually found their own flag but changed their strategy and decided not to give into Monis' demands. Daily Mail Australia has contacted police for comment. Monis forced his captives to relay his demands in videos uploaded to YouTube, posts on Facebook and calls to media outlets. His demands included a phone conversation with Prime Minister Tony Abbott, to be broadcasted live on radio, a public declaration from the government that the attack was being carried out by Islamic State terrorists, and the delivery of the flag.","Activist and Islam convert Rebecca Kay was contacted by police .

"Patrons complaining that the sight of other customers wearing sweaty cycle clothing puts them off their food has prompted a hotel to ban the controversial lycra attire. Raffles hotel in Perth has done a complete backflip on its stance about allowing lycra-clad cyclists to dine in the venue as a sign was put up over the weekend declaring the right to refuse those wearing the fitted clothing. This comes just a week after four riders were refused service by a waiter due to their acquired look on Sunday January 4, and hotel management posted a clarification on Facebook insisting that the issue was not about their fashion sense but with the potential hazard of the parked bikes. But the venue quickly changed its tune after an overwhelming number of disgusted patrons responded to the post saying they lose their appetites when laying eyes on the 'Lycra'd loonies'. Scroll down for video . Raffles Hotel in Perth decided to ban lycra-clad cyclists after patrons complained about their fitted attire . The policy states it can also refuse people who are not wearing neat casual attire including high-visibility clothing, dirty work wear and board shorts . The sign states that management can refuse people who aren't wearing neat casual attire including board shorts, high-visibility clothing, dirty work wear and lycra cycle wear. Colonial Leisure Group State operations manager Vern Fogarty told The West Australian that the descision was made after the social media response supporting such a ban. Last Monday, management posted that the real issue was with the bikes potentially causing a safety hazard along the footpath and encouraged cyclists to lobby the council for more bike racks outside the venue. 'This decision was never a dress code issue, and if dress was communicated as the reason by our staff then we apologise for the misunderstanding and assure everyone that this is not the case,' the hotel posted on its Facebook page. Described as the 'Lycra'd loonies', patrons lashed out on the post not only complaining about the revealing look but also the smell and sweat that they claim is left behind on the seats. 'Lycra'd loonies, after pedalling around the countryside for hours, tend to get a bit on the nose, and there's nothing worse than a bunch smelly, sweaty cyclists sitting near you to put you off your tucker, one patron said. 'A good move by the publican, but he'd better be ready for a flood of these Lycra'd loonies descending on him just to get some publicity.' Matt Mcguire said that he was at the pub on Saturday when three lycra clad riders came in for lunch. 'All fat in tight clothes thinking they are gunna be the next lance Armstrong. Ban them all from entering places like that it puts you off your food.' Riki Barron was also all for the lycra ban. 'Surely the issue is with old men..............not bike racks! good on ya raffles for banning them. Lycra isn't acceptable clothing,' he posted. Social media users also complained that cyclists leave sweat on the seats at pubs and cafes . The cyclists have been described as 'Lycra'd loonies' with one patron suggesting they open up their own cafe . While Kev Parkinson decided to share some practical tips with the cyclists. 'If you're riding for exercise, wear loose clothing, you'll get more wind resistance and a better workout. You won't look as ridiculous and can stop for food wherever you like mostly.' 'If you're racing then by all means, wear lycra for the aerodynamics, but you don't have time to stop for a hot milk drink.' Drew Jones suggested that the riders to 'stick to coffee shops'. Who wants to see fat old men having some mid-life fitness crisis busting their fat guts while parading their tackle at my eye level when I take a seat,' he posted. 'Although we all appreciate that you have taken the initiative to get fit please be considerate of others. 'Your clothing is quite revealing you have just ridden countless kilometres in the sun and some not all of you are on the nose.' Carmen Louise Stone echoed those sentiments. 'Why don't you do the polite thing like the rest of us and get out of your smelly exercise clothes and have a shower before heading somewhere for a pint or coffee?' she posted. 'I don't head to a restaurant or a coffee bar straight after the gym and I would be refused so why should you be treated differently because you have a hot shot bike and fancy clothes?' David Wilson suggested that cyclists open their own cafe. 'That way the rest of the public dont need to sit in the sweat of cyclists mid way through their exercise,' he said. 'Don't really want to have coffee while 5 men walk past with their lycra clad junk at eye level either.' Ross Powell, along with his wife and two friends, were denied service at Raffles hotel for wearing lycra . The age-old issue resurfaced its ugly head on Sunday morning when outraged customers were denied their regular Sunday brunch at the local hotel because the keen cyclists were dressed in lycra. Ross Powell walked into the Raffles hotel to grab a table ahead of his wife and their two mates, who had all just gone on a morning cycle, when he was approached by a staff member who confronted him with an unexpected remark. 'Sorry mate you can't come in here - we've got a no lycra-free policy - we can't serve you,' the waiter said. Mr Powell was gobsmacked and told his companions as they walked in that they were not welcome due to their cycling attire. 'I've never been spoke to like that - it was horribly humiliating,' Mr Powell told Daily Mail Australia. 'I'm 43 years old and a father of two kids - I've never been kicked out of anywhere in my life - let alone for the clothes I was wearing.' His wife, Colleen Powell, questioned the waiter when the policy had been put in place and the waiter replied with two weeks ago. 'My wife pointed out that we were served in lycra the week before and then he walked away,' he said. Mr Powell insists the move is blatant discrimination. 'I think most pubs and clubs want young people who are hip and don't like the older crowd as a general rule,' he said. 'People don't like the way we look.' 'It would be considered discrimination if it happened to people with dogs or kids - or customers wearing high visibility clothing.' Hotel management said there was no such policy but a concern for safety where some bikes were parked . Daily Mail Australia approached the hotel for comment but has yet to have heard back. However, Colonial Leisure Group State operations manger Vern Fogarty denied there was a lycra ban to The West Australian saying the concern was residents complaining about some of the parked bikes causing a safety risk. 'It is not our dress standard,' he told the paper. 'We've served cyclists in lycra in the past and we're happy to serve cyclists in lycra in the future.' Mr Fogarty said the incident was a miscommunication which has now been clarified with the staff. But Mr Powell said the hotel's response was complete nonsense and that the message could not have been misconstrued. 'It's an absolute smokescreen - it's just spin,' he said. 'There was no ambiguity - he was clear about the policy.' Animosity towards cyclists is not a new issue and Mr Powell, who owns the Canning Bridge Cycles shop in Perth, said everybody needed to 'take a chill pill'. 'We all need to get along - the roads are for both cars and bikes,' he said. Mr Powell said he called the hotel on Monday and was told he would be contacted that afternoon following a management meeting about the matter but was yet to hear back. Mr Powell, who owns Canning Bridge Cycles, called for the animosity towards cyclists to be put to an end .","Four cyclists were refused service at a hotel in Perth for wearing lycra .

"Outspoken Australian comedian Adam Hills has slammed media mogul Rupert Murdoch for a tweet he sent out three days after the Paris terrorist attacks, which said all Muslims should be held responsible for the actions of jihadists. Hills fired off a tweet on Monday, calling Murdoch a 'growing pus sore', following the same formula the controversial News Corp boss used to compose his comment. The post from Murdoch, who has 500,000 followers, said: 'Maybe most Moslems peaceful, but until they recognize and destroy their growing jihadist cancer they must be held responsible.' The comment attracted outrage from the social media community, including Hills. 'Maybe all Australians lovely but until we recognise and destroy the growing pus sore that is we must be held accountable,' the host of UK talk show The Last Leg posted. Hills' post had attracted more than 1,500 retweets at the time of publication. But this is not the first time, the comedian has hit out at controversial figures. This latest incident involving Murdoch follows Hills calling out the actions of British TV personality Katie Hopkins who posted an insensitive stream of tweets regarding a British Ebola sufferer. On his show, Hills said he thought convicted paedophile Rolf Harris would have 'garnered his vote for d*** of the year but then a lady called Katie Hopkins sent a tweet'. Australian Adam Hills (left) has hit out at the media mogul Rupert Murdoch (right) for his controversial comments . Despite attracting criticism for his tweet, Murdoch maintained his stance, tweeting his followers that 'political correctness' made for 'denial and hypocrisy'. He added: 'Big jihadist danger looming everywhere from Philippines to Africa to Europe to US. 'Political correctness makes for denial and hypocrisy.' Murdoch's words sparked a storm on the social network, with many Muslim users outraged as Murdoch appeared to lay the blame for the terrorist attacks on satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket on an entire religion, which has more than a billion followers. One user blasted his sweeping generalisation, and said: '""they"" as in most Muslims????? You can't hold an entire religion of billions responsive [sic] for the actions of a few' Erwin Renaldi said: 'I'm really sad reading this. Insulting my faith and I have nothing to do with the extremists and I can do nothing.' Simon Edhouse added: 'Rupert, is West responsible for our extremists, Anders Breivik? etc'. Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling condemned Murdoch's comments, writing: 'I was born Christian. If that makes Rupert Murdoch my responsibility, I'll auto-excommunicate.' She then added: 'The Spanish Inquisition was my fault, as is all Christian fundamentalist violence. Oh, and Jim Bakker.' Bakker is a disgraced pastor and televangelist who resigned amid a sex scandal, and later served five years of an original 45-year prison sentence for fraud and conspiracy, after stealing millions from charitable donations. Others questioned Murdoch's own morals, and referred to the phone-hacking scandal at the now-defunct News of the World newspaper. Michael Monan replied: '@rupertmurdoch In the same way that you must be held responsible for ordering the hacking of the voicemails of dead school children?' Murdoch's words also prompted ridicule - with white men, journalists, Australians and men called Rupert apologising on his behalf. The creator of BBC sitcom Citizen Khan, Adil Ray, who said: 'I think all of Australia should be held responsible for Rupert Murdoch.' Matt Haig added: 'Rupert Murdoch thinks all Muslims should apologise for terrorism. So on behalf of white people I'd like to apologise for Rupert Murdoch.' Richard Robbins said: 'Am I to be held responsible for the rantings of octogenarian media moguls because we're both Caucasian?' Another user joked: 'Maybe most Ruperts peaceful, but until they recognize and destroy cancerous media dinosaur @rupertmurdoch, they must be held responsible.' To which, Rupert Franklin replied: 'I'd like to offer an apology on behalf of us all. Murdoch's comments don't represent the views of mainstream Rupert community.' And Matt Haig added: 'Rupert Murdoch wrote a tweet. As someone who uses Twitter I would like to apologise on his behalf.'","Comedian Adam Hills has slammed the media mogul for his comments .

"Prince Andrew has admitted he has been a 'fool' over his friendship with billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The Duke of York has found himself at the centre of a sex scandal over allegations he slept with a minor on three separate occasions - in London, New York and the US Virgin Islands - supplied to him by the paedophile. The fifth in line to the throne has 'emphatically denied' the bombshell allegations made by Virginia Roberts, but has now said he deeply regrets becoming involved with Epstein. Scroll down for video . The Duke of York, 54, has gone further than before in expressing regret at his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein . The Duke's first encounter with Ms Roberts was in 2001 and shows the prince with his arm around her waist . The Duke had previously said he had made an 'error of judgement' when he was snapped strolling through New York's Central Park in 2011 with Epstein following his release from jail. But now he is gone even further in expressing his regret for the ill-advised friendship. A source close to the Duke told the Sunday Telegraph: 'It would be crass and disingenuous to suggest he has been unaffected by this. 'He is watching the news and reading the headlines and even though the friendship with Jeffrey Epstein was acknowledged as being unwise back in 2011, the Duke has clearly had a long time this week for the consequences of that friendship to further sink in. More than ever, he can see how foolish it was.' He has also admitted he cannot go to court to clear his name as he is 'mindful he has already got himself in to unprecedented territory'. This is in contrast to Epstein's lawyer Alan Dershowitz who is counter-suing and urging the Duke to do likewise. He said: 'The story is totally made up. I don't know this woman, It is part of a pattern of made-up stories against prominent people and world leaders. 'I think it must be presumed all her allegations against Prince Andrew were false as well. 'You cannot allow these allegations to hang above you. The first question you have to ask yourself when you are charged with a crime like this is ""Is there any conceivable possibility you did it?"" and if the answer to that is ""no"", you have to fight back with every resource and ounce of energy available to you.' Epstein was convicted in a plea bargain deal of one count of soliciting underage prostitution and is now a registered level one sex offender after serving an 18-month prison sentence . The extraordinary allegations made by Roberts, now a 30-year-old married mother with three children, are part of a US civil case against Epstein. Roberts claims Prince Andrew had sex with her when she was 17 - a minor under US law - and was employed as a 'sex slave' by Epstein. They were introduced, she claims, through Ghislaine Maxwell, who acted as a 'madame' for the girl. Ms Maxwell denies the allegations. One picture, said to have been taken by Epstein during Andrew's first encounter with the girl in March 2001 shows the Prince with his arm around her waist as Maxwell looks on. Roberts claims that she was told by Epstein 'to give the Prince whatever he demanded and report back to him on the details of the sexual abuse.' Epstein was convicted in a plea bargain deal of one count of soliciting underage prostitution and is now a registered level one sex offender after serving an 18-month prison sentence. But the scandal re-emerged as Roberts added her name to a case trying to overturn Epstein's plea bargain. Epstein's home in the US Virgin Islands where it is alleged Prince Andrew had sex with Virginia Roberts . Last night Virginia's aunt Carol Roberts Kess, a devout Mormon who helped raise her, spoke for the first time to tell how terrified Virginia fled her Florida home several months ago amid fears of reprisals from billionaire Epstein and his rich and powerful friends. 'She knew these court papers were coming out so she packed up and fled,' Carol said. 'She is frightened for her life. She has angered a lot of powerful and very rich people. Who knows what they could do?' Carol, the sister of Virginia's father Sky, said her niece is now living in a ranch 'in the middle of nowhere' in Colorado with her husband and three young children. 'She doesn't feel safe,' retired teacher Carol added. 'There are too many powerful people involved and she is saying things they don't want made public. 'Virginia was living a happy life in Florida but she packed up and left because she knew this was coming and was scared for her own life and that of her family. 'Just before she left she told me she wouldn't be able to contact any family members for a while – for our own safety. She said, 'It's for the best. I don't want to put anyone in danger.' In a previous statement released through her lawyers, she said: 'I'm not going to be bullied back in to silence.' The Duke, 54, returned from his skiing holiday in Verbier, Switzerland, last week - it emerged yesterday that he has purchased the seven-bedroom ski chalet that he stayed in for as much as £13million . The Duke, 54, returned from his skiing holiday last week and has since remained at his home at the Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park. His next royal engagement is due to take place on January 21, when is set to appear at the World Economic Forum at Davos, in Switzerland. It emerged yesterday that the Duke and Duchess of York, his former wife, have splashed out on a seven-bedroom ski chalet in Verbier, Switzerland, for £13million. Although the couple divorced in 1996 after 10 years of marriage, they remained on good terms as they raised their two daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, and the duchess lives in the family home of Royal Lodge in Berkshire.

"Paedophile rock star Ian Watkins is set to receive a £150,000 pay-out from the sale of Lostprophets' management company . Paedophile singer Ian Watkins is set to receive an almost £150,000 payout from the sale of his former band's management company. The rock star is serving a 29-year sentence  for the attempted rape of a baby and scores of other sickening child sex offences. The singer's conviction forced his former band, Lostprophets, to break up and distribute their assets worth more than £700,000. His four former band mates made the decision to wind up the firm - called Goonies Touring Company Ltd - after he was jailed in November 2013. It had almost £200,000 in cash plus more than £500,000 in assets and will be split five ways. This means 37-year-old Watkins, who had an appeal to reduce his jail term refused, is set to receive £147,497. A source told the Sunday Mirror: 'He is entitled to the money because it is cash earned by the band before this scandal broke. 'Many people will feel revulsion that he will have a nice little nest egg waiting for him when he's freed but it is his cash and it will go to him.' As well as the huge lump sum, Watkins is still earning royalties from Lostprophets' music, despite the band splitting up and forming a new group without the paedophile. Music lawyer Craig Brookes explained last year that as the band's lyricist, Watkins will be in line for a big cut of any fees generated. 'The biggest income stream will almost certainly be publishing which, even if radio play has stopped, will still be pretty big,' he told Wales on Sunday. Lostprophets made the decision to wind up their management firm, worth more than £700,000, after Watkins' (second from right) conviction for child sex offences, including the attempted rape of a baby . 'This is because PRs and their equivalents in different countries allocate money on a spot-check basis. 'So you're going to get money for plays in gyms and hairdressers and on jukeboxes and all that stuff. 'They will say, ""This is how much music is in the market place so it is likely you are due this amount.""' Lostprophets were founded in Pontypridd, south Wales, in 1997 and the band sold about 3.5 million albums worldwide.

"One of the most common questions in gardening is: 'How should I prune?' Usually followed by: 'When should I do that?' But a bigger question is why? So, here's a thumbnail guide. Pruning alters the way plants grow, so you can turn a natural growing tree into an espalier. And it helps to maintain plant health. Removing leggy, diseased shoots cuts the risk of infection. We can prune to rejuvenate old or neglected shrubs, or to make certain plants — roses, wisteria, currants — flower or fruit more. Shrubs or trees can also be cut back to maintain their size and natural appearance. In formal gardens, pruning takes place in the form of hedge clipping, topiary and bonsai training. Most pruning is pretty straightforward, but developing young fruit trees is complex. If you want to try fan-training, cordon or spindlebush pruning, use a good manual. I swear by the RHS Encyclopedia Of Gardening (Dorling Kindersley, £35). TO BE YOUNG AGAIN . Pruning alters the way that the plants grow so you can turn a natural growing tree into an espalier . Winter is the season for restorative pruning. With mature, neglected trees — fruit or ornamental — thin overcrowded branches and, if necessary, remove surplus limbs to develop an airy, hollow-centred crown. Old or weak trees often produce upright stems, or 'water shoots', from main branches and the trunk. These should be removed. New life can be given to old, bushy or exhausted shrubs by cutting the whole plant back to 60cm, or to dormant buds at that height. Treat big shrub roses, mock orange and viburnums in this way. But don't hack back non-vigorous rhododendrons, witch hazel, daphnes or slow-growing shrubs. SMALLER PRUNING JOBS . Remove any thin, weak or awkwardly growing stems form roses, they can be pruned between now and March . Roses, particularly hybrid teas, floribundas and patio varieties can be pruned fairly hard between now and March. Remove any thin, weak, ageing or awkwardly growing stems. Cut back remaining stems to an outward-facing bud, removing about a third of the growth. Shrub roses, or any that flower only once a year, need less attention. Remove old flowers and spindly or diseased stems. Late summer shrubs, particularly Buddleia davidii, some hypericums, hardy hibiscus and big hydrangeas such as H. paniculata can be pruned in late winter/early spring. You can savage buddleias, cutting back to low buds. With hardy hibiscus, prune stems by a third. Mop-head hydrangeas need only the dead blooms removing, but cut other kinds harder back. Spring-flowering clematis shouldn't be touched, but those that flower from late June can be cut back hard. If you prune the wrong ones by mistake, don't despair — you'll only lose some of this spring's show. That's the beauty of pruning: though you may make mistakes, recovery is almost inevitable.

"Ed Miliband  refused seven times to deny that he wanted to ‘weaponise’ the NHS in the forthcoming election campaign. At Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons last week, David Cameron accused the Labour leader of using the ‘disgusting’ term in a private conversation, citing it as proof that Mr Miliband intended to make the NHS a ‘political football’ in the upcoming battle for power. When he was repeatedly asked in a live TV interview if he had indeed used the word, Mr Miliband would say only that he could not recall whether he had done or not. Scroll down for video . When he was repeatedly asked in a live TV interview if he had threatened to 'weaponise' the NHS, Labour leader Ed Miliband would say only that he could not recall whether he had done or not . The Labour leader told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show: ‘What I've said is I want to fight for the NHS. I don't recall exactly what I said. 'But we are in a fight for the National Health Service, and I make absolutely no apologies for the fact that I'm really concerned about what's happening to our National Health Service in this country. ‘I don't recall exactly what I said, but what I'm clear about is we are in a fight for the NHS and I think that's really important. The Prime Minister went into the last general election and he said he could be trusted with the National Health Service.' He added: 'He has betrayed that trust with people. We've seen an NHS where we've seen tents erected in hospital car parks this week.’ Challenged over whether he would disown the word ‘weaponise’, Mr Miliband said: ‘What I don't disown... what I absolutely stand by is that we are in a fight for the future of the National Health Service. 'I don't think this is about the words we use, this is about how we are going to change this country so that we have an NHS that properly works for people again and isn't going backwards, as it is under this Government.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband clashed with  David Cameron last week over the NHS crisis  after the PM raised comments he had made to the BBC political editor Nick Robinson (right) David Cameron said it was 'disgusting' for Mr Miliband to say he wanted to 'weaponise' the NHS to win votes . At Wednesday's session of PMQs, Mr Cameron said: ‘The Leader of the Opposition apparently said to the political editor of the BBC, “I want to weaponise the NHS”. 'That is what he said, and I think that is disgraceful.' ‘The NHS is not a weapon, it is a way we care for our families, it is a way we care for the elderly, it is a way we look after the frail. Perhaps when he gets to his feet he will deny that he said he wanted to “weaponise” the NHS – a disgusting thing to say.’ Following Mr Miliband’s interview, BBC political editor Nick Robinson tweeted: ‘If anyone doubted Ed Miliband spoke of ""weaponising"" NHS I think he cleared that up on Marr just now – repeatedly didn't deny or disown it.’","David Cameron accused Labour leader of using ‘disgusting’ term in private .

"On June 9, 1942, a speech was broadcast on the BBC that would change human history. Władysław Sikorski, Poland's prime minister exiled in London, revealed that 700,000 Jews had been systematically murdered in brutal Nazi concentration camps, quarantined and executed en-masse in ghettos, and walked to their deaths in gas chambers. This was the first time the world and the Allied forces had heard of the crimes of the Holocaust, a secret the Nazi leaders had been able to keep until now. The information, a dossier of photographs and documents, had come to London from Poland via Stockholm, thanks to a group of Swedish men who had risked their lives to tell the world about the Nazi persecution of Polish Jews . Forgotten hero: Sven Norrman, responsible for couriering the documents that would reveal the Nazi Holocaust and slaughter of 700,000 Polish Jews out of Warsaw, pictured with his Polish-Jewish mistress Gizela 'Iza' Zbyszynska in the years after the war . News of  atrocities committed by the Nazi occupiers in Poland had reached the Allies before Sikorski's speech, but never on this scale. Sikorski had even been advised by a fellow Polish politician to 'edit' the number of Jews murdered by the Nazis from 700,000 to 7,000, as the number was to shocking to be believed. The information in Sikorski's speech would go down in history, but the man who got it there, a Swedish businessman named Sven Norrman, all but forgotten. Sven Norrman, born in 1892, head of Swedish engineering company ASEA in Warsaw, Poland when the Germans invaded in 1939. Norrman and a group of fellow Swedish expatriates working for corporations that would later become Swedish Match and mobile phone giant Ericsson, were evacuated but later returned. Death sentence: Sigfrid 'Sigge' Häggberg is photographed in the Moabit prison in Berlin after Gestapo sentenced him and four other Warsaw Swedes to death in 1943, one year after their arrest . Brave: Nils Berglind was the executive director of LM Ericsson in Poland, the company that would later become mobile phone giant Ericsson . Hero: Carl Herslow, chief executive of Svenska Tändsticksaktiebolaget, later Swedish Match, in Poland . Released: Tore Widén, an engineer for  Swedish Match, and the three other Warsaw Swedes, were later pardoned and returned to Sweden . Norrman and the Swedes lived as comfortable as it was possible in occupied Warsaw; electrics, phone lines and matches were, after all, goods and services the Germans had use of. Most of the time was spent living in a bunker in the Swedish Embassy. Norrman, by now in his late 40s, spoke Polish and was well liked by his staff. Before the war, he had enjoyed hunts, collected Polish art, and had fallen in love with his secretary, a young Polish Jew named Gizela 'Iza' Zbyszynska. Soon, Norrman and the others were witnessing increasing anti-Semitic violence and oppression of the Polish Jews. Norrman was able to photograph the very first implementation of the law requiring Jews to wear a yellow Star of David on their clothes, a practice which began in Poland. He was later able to lie his way into the ghetto in Warsaw and took thousands of pictures of the horror within, before he was ushered out by a Jewish policeman for his own safety. As the Nazis escalated their persecution and harassment, friends and colleagues of the Warsaw Swedes were jailed or simply disappeared, and when Norrman was approached by the Polish resistance army, he and the others decided to take a stand. Travel in and out of occupied Poland was heavily restricted, but the men from neutral Sweden could move across the borders, so became the perfect couriers for Armia Krajowa - the Polish Home Army. The Warsaw Swedes had been told by their employers in no uncertain terms than nothing was to be done that could anger the German occupiers. The Swedish government wanted to avoid an invasion at all costs, and as a result, remaining neutral was paramount. Moreover, the Warsaw Swedes knew that being discovered would lead to a certain death. Despite this, Norrman and his fellow Warsaw Swedes began transporting goods with secret compartments in which they had hidden documents, photo-negatives  and money. Norrman, working under the alias 'Hjalmar', would become the most important connection between the Polish exile government in London and the resistance in Warsaw. On May 16, 1942, the commander-in-chief of the Polish Armia Krajowa, General Rowecki, telegraphed to London: 'The Swedes take a very irregular route; still, they are fast and reliable and moreover can be entrusted with large deliveries. We cannot allow them to be exposed.' Just days later, on May 21, Sven Norrman would take a very important suitcase with a hidden compartment from Warsaw to Stockholm. It contained documents detailing the systematic slaughter of 700,000 Polish Jews by the Nazis, including 2,000 photonegatives of Nazi warcrimes in Poland, some taken by 51-year-old Norrman himself from inside the Warsaw ghetto. Sven Norrman, right, with fellow Warsaw Swede Sigge Häggberg, centre, and Häggberg's son, left, on a bird hunt in Poland in the mid-1930s . This picture was taken by Sven Norrman in October 1939 in Wloclawek, where the law forcing Polish Jews to wear a yellow Star of David on their clothes was first implemented by the Nazis. The Jews were also banned from using the sidewalks. The picture bears the sarcastic caption: The master race's cultural endeavors in Wloclawek. Even woman and children walk in the street in Wloclawek with yellow marks on their backs' A letter to King Gustav V of Sweden from Adolf Hitler regarding the four Swedes sentenced to death . Sikorski held his BBC speech a week later, and it did not take long before Gestapo began rounding up the Warsaw Swedes. 'Personally, I think the Germans listening in June 1942 grew worried and pissed off that the BBC was able to reveal in such detail exactly what was going on in Warsaw, and started to wonder how the hell the information had leaked,' says Staffan Thorsell, author of Warszawasvenskarna - De som lät världen veta (The Warsaw Swedes - The men who let the world know). 'Gestapo did not have to be Sherlock Holmes to figure out that the Swedes who travelled regularly between Warsaw and Stockholm could be involved.' Seven Swedish men; Nils Berglind, Carl Herslow, Sigfrid 'Sigge' Häggberg, Tore Widén, Einar Gerge, Stig Lagerberg and Reinhold Grönberg were arrested by the Gestapo in July on Heinrich Himmler's order. Sven Norrman was lucky. He was in Stockholm, and his mistress, Iza, had been able to get a message to him that Gestapo was looking for him. As he was the main suspect, it is likely that she saved his life. Iza herself was also captured by Gestapo and taken to the Moabitprison in Berlin. Four of the men, Berglind, Herslow, Häggberg and Widén were sentenced to death in July 1943. However, all seven would return safely to Sweden. There are several theories why the four Warsaw Swedes were pardoned, and all are thought to have contributed to their final release in the autumn 1944. Upon hearing that four Swedish men had been sentenced to death in Nazi Germany, the King of Sweden, Gustav V, wrote to Hitler himself and asked that the Warsaw Swedes be released. Hitler admired royalty, and in particular those in countries that he perceived to be the birthplace of the 'Aryan' race, and personally assured King Gustav V that he would look into the matter in a letter sent at the end of July 1943. The documents Sven Norrman transported from Poland to London via Sweden detailing the horror of the Nazi concentration camps and the use of gas chambers were translated into Swedish later in 1942, but banned by the then-government so as to not upset Nazi-Germany . Back in Warsaw: This photograph shows Sigge Häggberg, a Warsaw Swede who worked for Ericsson,  in front of a bombed out telephone box in Warsaw in the summer of 1945 . It is also known that Heinrich Himmler's personal physical therapist, Felix Kersten, a man who has been credited with saving the lives of some 60,000 Jews from the Nazi concentration camps, put in a good word with the Nazi top brass. However, most importantly, Nazi Germany relied on neutral Sweden to supply them with iron and ball-bearings for their weapons, and it is highly likely that the four Warsaw Swedes were kept as leverage, to ensure that Sweden would fulfil their end of the weaponry bargain. 'To their contemporaries, the Warsaw Swedes were no heroes, but a risk factor,' Mr Thorsell adds. 'They had put Sweden in danger through their efforts for the Polish resistance army and by raising the alarm about the Holocaust.' A book based on the documents Norrman transported to from Poland via Stockholm to London was published in Sweden during the war, but every single copy was confiscated by the government before it even reached the shelves. The then prime minister, Social Democrat Per Albin Hansson, had personally ordered that the book, called 'A Polish Black Book On The German ""New Order"" In Poland', be collected from the publishers and banned. After the war, Norrman had one priority. Find Iza. Although Iza had lived as a Christian while in Warsaw, Gestapo uncovered her Jewish heritage shortly after her capture, and she spent the remainder of the war in a part of the Moabit prison reserved for Jews. She survived her ordeal, and in 1945, Isa and Sven Norrman could be reunited in Warsaw. In his book about the Warsaw Swedes, Mr Thorsell writes that Norrman most likely saved her life through bribes passed via Swedish Match's director in Germany to Himmler's man Walter Schellenberg. Norrman divorced his wife, and the couple married in Sweden. Norrman was later rewarded the Armia Krajowa Cross by the Poles. In an interview with Polish historian Jozef Lewandoski in the 1970s, Norrman explained why he decided to risk his life to help tell the world about the Holocaust. 'During my entire life I was a businessman. I liked my job and I was good in my field. 'I joined the struggle because I wanted to do something that was not for profit for once in my life.'","The 'Warsaw Swedes' worked in Poland before and during WWII .

"When Jody Kinsey of Miles City was told last summer she was pregnant with triplets, everyone in the family was surprised - except for her husband, Jase. 'My dad's a multiple,' the 29-year-old father told the Billings Gazette after the three boys were born. 'I just kind of had that feeling that it would get me sooner or later.' Since Jody, 30, wasn't undergoing fertility treatment, the odds of that actually happening were, in the words of Dr Dana Damron, one in a million. Scroll down for video . Special delivery: Jody Kinsey of Miles City, Montana, gave birth to identical triplets, which are an extremely rare case for women not undergoing fertility treatment . 'To have a patient with spontaneous identical triplets is incredibly rare,' said Dr Damon, a maternal fetal medicine physician at the Billings Clinic where the triplets were delivered. KULR reports that the first one to be born, Cade, is already out of the intensive care unit, and will soon be joined by his brothers Ian and Milo. The triplets were born early in December, at 32 weeks, nothing out of the ordinary for triplets in the United States, according to Billings Clinic registered nurse Tiffany Draayer. 'You take care of their oxygenation, make sure they're breathing well,' said Draayer. 'All three of them did really well, and they just have to work on eating.' 'Once they can all eat, and don't have to be tube-fed for their feedings for a few days, then they get to go home,' she added. Dr Damron said that considering the difficulty in delivering triplets, the pregnancy went as smoothly as possible. Happy and healthy: Ian, Milo and Cade are healthy, according to clinic officials, who say they'll be ready to go home once they can eat on their own . Intensive care: The triplets were kept in intensive care due to being born premature at 32 weeks, though medical staff say this is normal for triplets . Comedy of errors: The triplets' father, Jase, is already envisioning his three sons causing hijinks as identical siblings . 'When you see a patient with triplets, you take a deep breath and realize all sorts of complications that can occur,' he said. 'But when it turns out well in the end, it’s one of the most amazing experiences.' Their father is already planning for the triplets to get into the habit of slapstick hijinks when they're older. 'They can scheme together and get it figured out to where, ""Okay you're better at math, so you go to my math class, and you go to my math class, and I'll go to English, 'cause I'm better at English,' said Jase. Jody was only focused on bringing them back home to join their six-year-old brother Jax. 'It'll be nice to get them all home, and get a routine figured out,' she said.","Jody Kinsey, 30, of Miles City delivered identical triplets early in December .

"A distraught father who barricaded himself in a hospital room over the treatment of his ill son, causing a four-hour police standoff, has surrendered. Armed officers, state police and a SWAT team surrounded Tomball Regional Medical Center, near Houston, resulting in a four-hour stand-off with the unidentified man. He gave himself up to police negotiators, who confirmed that he was unarmed when they took him in. He had sealed himself in the critical care unit, where his son was being treated. The Harris County Sheriff's Office had earlier said they thought the man did have a gun - and that he had taken two hostages. Scene: Police rushed to the Tomball Regional Hospital where the situation was unfolding Saturday night . Gearing up: A SWAT team was seen at the hospital, where the man is barricaded inside, and is thought to have a gun . Negotiators: Officers were trying to resolve the situation with a 'peaceful surrender'. The man is now believed not to have hostages . The upset father was taken into custody at 10.45pm local time, officers said. Investigators are continuing to look into the situation, but the hospital has been taken out of lockdown. The confrontation with officials began around 7pm. Harris County Sheriff's officials said the man was 'distraught' but did no elaborate as to why. Rooms next to the one where the man barricaded himself in were evacuated, but the majority of the hospital was not. Officers on the scene told reporters that they thought the man was armed - but it later emerged he did not have any kind of weapon.

"It was designed to collect excess rain and ground water. But on Saturday, this storm drain caught something else - a one-year-old Siberian husky. The pup, named Bella, was spotted trapped in the drain in San Diego, California, by a passerby. She was sporting a forlorn expression, while only her head, ears and front leg were poking out. Trapped: This Siberian husky, named Bella, became stuck in a storm drain in Encanto, San Diego, on Saturday . It is unknown how Bella ended up in the drain, nor how long she had been stuck there for. Two San Diego County Animal Services officers arrived at the scene in the city's Encanto neighborhood after being alerted to the crisis by the passerby, according to NBC. However, as soon as they approached the pup, she retreated further into the drain. So, the pair devised a new plan in a bid to get Bella out: They blocked the pipe, before walking the animal through the drain to a grate. A strong Good Samaritan then pulled the grate up and away. Scene: The pup was spotted by a passerby trapped in the drain at the junction of Woodrow Avenue and Viewcrest Drive (pictured). She was sporting a forlorn expression, with only her head and front leg poking out . Once the piece of metal was removed, the husky could finally be lifted out, county officials said. The pup who was microchipped, has been reunited with her unidentified owner following the incident, which occurred at the junction of Woodrow Avenue and Viewcrest Drive .

"A gunman allegedly killed his adoptive mother, his landlord and an Arby's restaurant manager in a murderous gun rampage in Idaho. John Lee, 29, was arrested in the wake of the killings in Moscow, Idaho. He was caught by police after a high-speed chase in neighboring Washington state. Police said Lee's killing spree began with Terri Grzebielski, 61, who had adopted him. He then allegedly tracked down his landlord, 76-year-old David Trail, and killed him too. Response: Ambulance workers rush one of the shooting victims allegedly gunned down by John Lee, 29, in Moscow, Idaho . Police: Heavily-armed officers are shown talking while comrades hunted for Lee, who was arrested after a high-speed chase . Police say he also shot Michael Chin, 39, of Seattle during that portion of the attack. Trail died at Pullman Regional Hospital and Chin was listed in critical condition Saturday night at Gritman Medical Center in Moscow. The shooter then drove to an Arby's restaurant and asked for the manager. When she appeared, he pulled out a gun and opened fire. The manager, 47-year-old Belinda Niebuhr, died at the Moscow hospital. Duke said that Trail, the brother of a former Idaho state representative, was Lee's landlord. He said there were 'some issues' regarding the apartment, but didn't know of any eviction proceeding. Chin was discussing business with Trail when the gunman arrived. Duke said Chin was shot in the arm and leg, and would be flown to a Seattle hospital. Guard: One policeman stands outside an office where David Trail, 76, and Michael Chin, 39, were shot. Trail died from his wounds, while Chin is in critical condition in hospital . Investigators have yet to find any link between Lee and the Arby's manager. 'We know he didn't work there,' Duke said.  The chief said that the surviving workers did not recognize Lee. Kelsey Stemrich said she was working at a cafe near Arby's when she and a customer heard three gunshots and then saw people running from the restaurant. She says they took down the license plate number of a car seen pulling away from the Arby's and called it into police. Police in Washington spotted the suspect's black Honda and a chase involving multiple agencies ensued. Pullman Police Chief Gary Jenkins said the pursuit lasted nearly 25 miles and Lee's vehicle at times topped 100 mph before crashing off Highway 195 north of Colfax and rolling to a stop. Lee was taken to a Colfax hospital for treatment of minor injuries before he was booked into the Whitman County Jail on a charge of felony eluding. Investigators had yet to recover the gun. Duke said it was probably still in the car and detectives were awaiting a search warrant Saturday night before looking for it. Moscow authorities had yet to announce any Idaho charges late Saturday, saying the investigation remains active. Moscow is a city of about 25,000 people in northern Idaho. It's about 10 miles from Pullman, Washington. Help: Emergency medical technicians from the Moscow Volunteer Fire Department aid one of two men shot in the office building.

"A doctor who had a sexual relationship with a patient after examining his genitals and exchanged medical matters with another patient through social media has been suspended for three months. General practitioner Biljana Nikolova-Trask allegedly violated the professional boundaries between herself and three patients in Broken Hill in the far west outback of NSW. It was alleged that Dr Nikolova-Trask was involved in a ‘close personal relationship’ with a man, known as Patient A while treating his wife, Patient B and daughter Patient C in 2009. The Health Care Complaints Commission (HCCC) heard that she developed a friendship with Patient B and provided blood test results and medical advice via Facebook and text messaging. General practitioner Biljana Nikolova-Trask violated the professional boundaries with three patients . Shortly after Patient A separated from his wife, Patient B – Dr Nikolova-Trask and Patient A started a sexual relationship in June 2010. It is understood the practitioner and Patient A are now in a ‘de facto relationship and have a daughter, aged two-and-a-half at the date of the hearing,’ a statement from the Tribunal said. It was further alleged that between 2008 and 2009, Dr Nikolova-Trask maintained a ‘close personal relationship with another patient, known as Patient D. The New South Wales Civil and Administrative Tribunal found that the pair had communicated outside of work and ‘exchanged many text messages often in the early hours of the morning’. 'Patient D continued to see the practitioner on a professional basis in 2009 on four separate occasions between January 2009 and June 2009,’ a statement from the tribunal said. But the practitioner denied she stayed overnight at Patient D's home, or that she 'engaged in a sexual relationship with him'. Dr Nikolova-Trask was based in Broken Hill in the far west outback of NSW where she practised . It was alleged that Dr Nikolova-Trask maintained a ‘close personal relationship' with a number of patients . On July 17 2009, Dr Nikolova-Trask sent a facebook message to Patient B claiming that she was staying overnight at another home on a 'particular street'. 'Patient B asserts she understood the relevant house to be Patient D's home', the statement said. One month later, the practitioner examined Patient D's genital. Following the consultation, she discussed  the possibility of starting a sexual relationship with him and asked if he could transfer to another practitioner. In February 2010, Patient D was seen again by Dr Nikolova-Trask after he was in a motorbike accident. It was alleged that she 'engaged in improper conduct' with Patient D where she continued to treat him while maintaining an intimate personal relationship with him. She is prohibited from working as a sole practitioner for three years and must work under supervision . The Tribunal found that Dr Nikolova-Trask’s conduct is a ‘serious breach of the standards the public have a right to expect of a practitioner’. But it also found that the practitioner's evidence  'demonstrated a lack of insight into the seriousness of her conduct'. The HCCC said Dr Nikolova-Trask's conduct in concealing from her close friend Patient B and her relationship with Patient A may have been 'morally wrong' but it was 'not misconduct'. Along with her three months suspension, the Tribunal ordered that Dr Nikolova-Trask is prohibited from working as a sole practitioner for three years. Within 12 months of the expiration of her suspension, she must complete a ‘Medical Ethics’ course at her own expense and be practised under a professional mentor for at least 18 months.

"Former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey said Britain's fear of Islam has led to a self-imposed 'blasphemy law' Britain's fear of criticising Islam has led to a self-imposed 'blasphemy law', the former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey has warned. Lord Carey's comments come days after the brutal slaughter of journalists at the offices of Charlie Hebdo magazine, which printed cartoons mocking the prophet Mohammed. He added that the Press should be encouraged to print controversial material, even if Muslims find it offensive. Writing in the Sunday Times, the former Archbishop said: 'A de facto blasphemy law is operating in Britain today. The fact is that publishers and newspapers live in fear of criticising Islam.' He said that blasphemy laws were 'unjust and outdated', urging Muslim scholars to make it clear to followers that Islamic laws on insulting the religion do not apply to non-believers. Lord Carey added that the media should be encouraged to publish controversial material, regardless of whether it will upset Muslims. 'We need not worry about taking the vast majority of Muslims with us. They are much more offended by violence committed in their name than by cartoons or images of their prophet,' he said. His view was backed up by Chancellor George Osborne, who said: 'Magazines should publish what they want ... without fearing that armed gunmen are going to come through the door and kill them.' Author Salman Rushdie, whose book 'The Satanic Verses' prompted Iranian clergy to issue a death fatwa on him, also condemned the attack on Charlie Hebdo as an assault on free speech. He said earlier this week: 'I stand with Charlie Hebdo, as we all must, to defend the art of satire, which has always been a force for liberty and against tyranny, dishonesty and stupidity.' The brutal attack by terrorists Cherif and Said Kouachi killed 12, including eight journalists and a Muslim policeman.

After a tense stand-off with soldiers and armed police, the Kouachi brothers were gunned down in a hail of gunfire. They are believed to have launched their attack on the satirical magazine's office because it has printed cartoons of the prophet Mohammed in the past. A German newspaper which reprinted the cartoons was attacked overnight by vandals who set fire to files in a cellar below its offices and threw rocks at windows.","Former Archbishop of Canterbury says Britain fears criticising Islam .

"Five people arrested in connection with the Paris terror attacks were last night released from custody. The gunmen who carried out the attacks on the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, a policewoman outside Paris, a kosher market and a printing house all died after standoffs with police. Relatives of the attackers have been given preliminary charges - but five people were freed from custody yesterday, and no-one now remains in detention over the attacks that left 17 people dead. Coming together: Thousands of people attend  a demonstration in solidarity with the victims of terrorist attacks in and around Paris linked to Wednesday's attack on Charlie Hebdo in Marseille yesterday . Backing: Several thousand people walk behind a banner which reads 'Live Together Free, Equal, and United' as they march to pay tribute to the victims following the shooting  during a demonstration in Nantes yesterday . The details were confirmed this morning by Paris prosecutor's spokesman Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre. Hayat Boumddiene, the widow of one gunman - named as an accomplice - is said by intelligence officials to have travelled to a Turkish city near the Syrian border before all traces of her were lost. Brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi killed 12 people at the Charlie Hebdo offices, led police on a chase for two days and were cornered on Friday at a printing house near Charles de Gaulle Airport. Separately, Amedy Coulibaly shot a policewoman to death and attacked the Paris kosher market, threatening more violence unless police let the Kouachis go. Four hostages died, as did Coulibaly. Among those arrested but since released was 18-year-old Mourad Hamyd, who became known as 'the third suspect’ - even though he was in class at the time of the shooting.

Hayat Boumddiene (right), the widow of gunman Amedy Coulibaly (left) - named as an accomplice - is said by intelligence officials to have travelled to a Turkish city near the Syrian border before all traces of her were lost . The brother-in-law of Cherif handed himself into police on Wednesday, horrified and baffled to hear his name circulating in the news and on social media. But the high school student was released without charge on Friday evening, and told AFP: ‘I was stunned, completely overwhelmed by the events but the police officers were very correct with me.’ Numerous witnesses verified he was in school when the Kouachi brothers gunned down 12 people at Charlie Hebdo. And Mr Hamyd said: ‘I'm in shock, people said horrible and false things about me on social media even though I am a normal student who lives quietly with his parents.’ He added: ‘The attack was horrific and my thoughts are with the victims.’ It remains unclear how Mr Hamyd - who until last week was unknown to the police - became linked to the magazine attack. Tributes: People hold bouquets of flowers as  a French police officer tries to maintain the crowd during a demonstration yesterday outside a kosher grocery store where four hostages were killed on Friday in Paris . On guard: A French soldier patrols near the Eiffel Tower yesterday as part of the highest level of 'Vigipirate' security plan after a shooting at the Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo . He said: ‘I only hope this won't taint my future. I have nothing to do with this whole thing, Cherif is just my brother-in-law with whom we have a fairly distant relationship.’ Mr Hamyd's sister, who is married to Cherif, was taken into custody on Wednesday and freed on Saturday. ‘I am sure she is also innocent,’ an unnamed relative told AFP. Her lawyer, Christian Saint-Palais, said she has condemned the killings, and expressed her sympathy for the victims. Mr Saint-Palais also said the wife had been unaware of her husband's plot, and had 'the same reaction to the rest of the national community' to the shootings, which had left her 'stunned'. As France prepared for a huge march in Paris in honour of the victims today, Mr Hamyd's family said they would attend a rally in their town of Charleville-Mezieres to pay their own tribute. But Mr Hamyd, hoping to fade back into anonymity as soon as possible, will not be joining them. Meanwhile, MailOnline can reveal that Mr Hamyd, who was linked with driving the getaway car that carried the Kourachis from the Charlie Hebdo offices, was due to have his driving test on Friday. The teenager had a driving lesson at 5pm on Wednesday evening with instructor Jean-Claude Garraud, just hours after the brutal massacre that shocked the world. A police officer stands guard on a road leading to the offices of satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo yesterday . Shocking scene: Masked gunman fire their weapons outside Charlie Hebdo's office in Paris on Wednesday . Mr Garraud said: ‘He was hesitant and distracted during the lesson. For example, he stopped the car on the road where he should not have. ‘At 6am on Thursday morning, I heard on the radio he had been arrested. I was completely shocked. He is a calm and good boy. He is not a delinquent. He is serious.’ Today, a major rally of defiance and sorrow - protected by an unparalleled level of security - will honour the 17 victims of three days of bloodshed in Paris that left France on alert for more violence. Unity against extremism is the rallying cry for the hundreds of thousands expected to attend the gathering, including the Israeli prime minister and the Palestinian president. More than 2,000 police are being deployed on Sunday to protect the crowds, in addition to the tens of thousands already guarding synagogues, mosques, schools and other sites around France.","Some relatives of the attackers have been given preliminary charges .

"A 2-year-old English mastiff whose heroism likely saved a family's 9-month-daughter is now fighting for his own life. Duke, who woke up his owner Lucia Piscoglio when her baby Ava Jane appeared to be suffocating in her crib, had a massive allergic reaction to a Lyme disease vaccine just days later. Now, as the hulking pooch fights to stay alive, his heartwarming bond with little Ava has helped bring a flood of well-wishes and even monetary donations to the Piscoglio's from across the internet and even the globe. Adorable: A 2-year-old English mastiff named Duke helped save his 9-month-old best friend Ava Jane Piscoglio when she appeared to be suffocating in her crib . 'When my daughter was born he became her best friend and protector,' said mother Lucia Piscoglio . The positive vibes first came courtesy of other mastiff lovers after Piscoglio, of Swedesboro, posted her story to a Facebook group dedicated to the breed called Mastiffs Rule Drool is Cool. 'Throughout my pregnancy he was with me everyday,' Piscoglio writes. 'Once Ava Jane was born he immediately became her best friend.' Around Ava's 9-month birthday, Duke ran into Piscoglio's room barking. 'I looked into the monitor and saw Ava's face deep into the bumper pad. As Duke and I ran to her side I didn't feel her inhale or exhale,' the mother writes. Thanks to quick thinking on the part of both mother and dog, Ava was soon breathing normally. Unfortunately for the hero Duke, he would soon be the one in need of a hero after a severe allergic reaction that, at least at first, appeared to come out of nowhere. Duke suffered a severe allergic reaction to a vaccine just days after helping save his little sister Ava Jane . Piscoglio writes: . 'He became so ill we rushed him back to the vet, he was swollen all over, not eating, not drinking, not going to the bathroom or even moving After two nights in the hospital with tons of test being ran he began to turn around slowly. 'He is now home with his family with a steroid pill, antibiotic, Benadryl twice a day and Pepcid. He also will have a strict diet. 'The final diagnosis is that he had one of the worse allergic reactions they have ever seen due to a Lyme Vaccine.' Piscoglio's emotional tale elicited thousands of likes and comments on the original post and subsequently at another Facebook page started by Piscoglio called Duke & Vaccination Awareness. 'Ask questions because we almost lost Duke to something preventable,' Piscoglio writes. 'I am not against vaccines but please educate yourselves on the risk!' The family has also received monetary support thanks to a GoFundMe page dedicated to Duke. In three days, just 54 people have helped to raise aruond $1,500 for the dog. 'The final diagnosis is that he had one of the worse allergic reactions they have ever seen due to a Lyme Vaccinem,' writes Piscoglio. Duke is now on a regimen of several drugs and a strict diet after the reaction left him horrible swollen .","The 2-year-old English mastiff saved his New Jersey's owners' 9-month-old baby early this month .

"Hot diggity dog! The former home of Oscar G. Mayer Sr., son of the man who established the Oscar Mayer Company, is now up for grabs. The $1.75 million Evanston, Illinois, home features six bedrooms and four bathrooms, plus 7,401 square feet, according to its listing. Many of the 1903 home's windows are boarded up - indeed, its listing says 'Elegance of a bygone era is still there, but much work needs to be done to restore to previous grandeur.

'Amazing original woodwork and stairway. Being sold in ""as is' condition."" The listing says Mayer occupied the residence for 18 years, from 1927 all the way to 1965. Mayer died in March of that year. His father Oscar F. Mayer established the Oscar Mayer Company, Crain's Business Chicago reported last month.  Oscar G. Mayer Sr. grew up to eventually serve as chairman. Former resident Sigmund Eisenschenk's estate is selling the home, according to the website. The estate special administrator Peter J. Schmeidel told Crain's that the home's sale was accepted by a judge in autumn 2014. Evanston History Center's Krist Hartzell told the website the home was built in 1901 and was a Hallburg & Sturm creation. She also told the website there is a curved tower inside the home as well as a ballroom. Hartzell said she didn't believe the home will be knocked down, since it is a local landmark. 'There's been a lot of buzz and concern for this house... everyone was concerned no one was taking care of it and that it was going to deteriorate beyond the point of repair,' she told Crain's Chicago Business. 'We're pleased that it's on the market.' The first of the company's famed Wienermobiles was created in 1936, and its 'Oh, I'd love to be an Oscar Mayer wiener. That is what I'd truly like to be' song first appeared in 1963, the company says. His son, Oscar G. Mayer Jr., later served as company chairman, retired in 1977, and died in 2009 according to the Associated Press. Former owner: Oscar G.

"In the face of sub-zero temperatures and freezing winds, New Yorkers braved the cold and went bare-legged for the annual 'No Pants Subway Ride' on Sunday. Wearing hats, scarves and thick coats on their top halves, boarded trains at stations across the city - surrounded by bemused travellers. Scantily-clad riders also took part in places including London, Milan, Bucharest, Berlin and Mexico City - all joined in as part of the 'celebration of silliness'. Scroll down for video .

Even though there is snow on the ground outside, one female commuter decides to bare her midriff as she walks with a friend  through a New York subway station . It started off as a prank by comedy group Improv Everywhere in 2002, bemusing a few embarrassed commuters, but has since grown into a global phenomenon. The rules of the event, which is in its 14th year, are fairly straightforward. Underpants must be worn and, although flashy designs are allowed, organisers prefer those involved to look - at least from the waist-up - as though they are going about their daily lives. This is to increase the impact the participants have on the unaware bystanders. In the inaugural event ago only seven people took part, but now thousands in major capital cities around the globe participate in what organisers call a 'celebration of silliness'. Uniforms and business suits are encouraged to amplify the lower-half effect as are props - bicycles, prams, shopping bags or a briefcase. Participants are also forbidden from speaking to one another and are instructed to bring 'any activity you might normally perform on the train: newspaper, book, sewing kit.'
