In world full of social networks and connections made here, there and everywhere with people in a virtual world, the term 'friend' is used a lot. But despite having more than 300 Facebook friends, British women can count their true friends on one just hand. That's according to a new survey which quizzed women between the ages of 18 and 35 years. They may have on average 338 Facebook friends but researchers found that the average number of true friends came out at just five, with some women admitting they have only one and others claiming to have up to 12. Despite having more than 300 Facebook friends, British women can count their true friends on one hand . True friends were classed as those you'd turn to in an emergency, friends you can talk to about anything and those that support and love you regardless of the situation. The qualities the respondents looked for in them included loyalty, being trustworthy, honest, discreet, reliable and someone like-minded. All those qualities were chosen by at least 90 per cent of the women when they were asked to pick out the attributes that made up a true friend. Almost three quarters of the women, 74 per cent, had a true friend they had grown up with, while 67 per cent had met at school or university. Almost half, 46 per cent, had met a true friend at work, while a third, 33 per cent, had done so through a shared interest and 29 per cent said they had met a true friend through their children. One respondent said: 'I grew up with one of my oldest friends and despite living in different parts of the country, we're still really close. Women may have on average 338 Facebook friends but the number of true friends came out at just five . 'I speak to her a couple of times a week and we're texting all the time. I don't know what I'd do without her. She's always there when I need her - whether that's a shoulder to cry on or someone to laugh with.' Another added: 'My circle of true friends has got larger as I've got older, but there's a couple that I've known since I was at school and they're always the first people I call on for anything. They probably know more about me than my mum and certainly more than my other half. I'd be lost without them.' A third said: 'I'd count my hubby as one of my true friends. I share everything with him - we have no secrets - and he knows as much about me as any of my girlfriends. He's not as good as gossiping as them though. I rely on the girls for that.' A spokesperson for money saving site FreeDeliveryLand.co.uk, who commissioned the research, said: 'It's interesting to see that despite most of us having hundreds of Facebook friends, we class very few of these as our true friends. 'It's always reassuring to know that you have friends you can rely on, friends who will support you whatever the situation and those you can turn to for a good cry or to share the high points with. 'The shared experiences you have certainly cement the friendship and make it one to value.'

'Deep feelings': Delta Ferneyhough was jailed for two years for reciprocating the teenager's advances . A teaching assistant who had sex with a 'besotted' 15-year-old pupil has been jailed for two years. Delta Ferneyhough corrupted the teenager 'with some vigour' by exchanging sexual messages, videos and photos with him, culminating in an illicit meeting at her home in Cleethorpes, Grimsby. The 28-year-old was discovered when the mother of the boy found a text from Ferneyhough which said 'Hi gorgeous'. Confronted by his mother with the evidence, he confessed he and his teaching assistant had sex. The boy's mother threatened to report Ferneyhough to the school where she worked, which cannot be named for legal reasons, unless she resigned her post. Ferneyhough would not resign, and once alerted the school told police and suspended her from her duties. She was later sacked. Jeremy Evans, prosecuting, told the court that the boy had a 'crush' on her and suffered serious emotional harm from the relationship. The teaching assistant admitted one count of sexual activity with a child in breach of a position of trust, and one count of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity. She was placed on the sex offenders' register for 10 years and handed a 10-year Sexual Offences Prevention Order, which severely restricts her future contact with boys under 16 and her use of the internet. Judge David Tremberg told Grimsby Crown Court: 'This defendant crossed a red line. She has contributed to corrupting this boy. 'There canâ€™t be a teacher or teaching assistant in England who does not know that engaging in sexual activity with a pupil is a fundamental breach of trust.' The judge said her conduct was 'profoundly inappropriate' and she 'led this young man on'. 'You were fully aware of your responsibilities and the procedures and protocols in place to ensure that children were safeguarded from staff,' he told her. Jailed: Grimsby Crown Court heard the boy may have been 'enthusiastic' to have sex with the teaching assistant but she committed a profound breach of trust. She said she was 'utterly ashamed' of her behaviour . 'You were the adult. You were in a position of authority and responsibility. What you did was wholly wrong and you well knew it from first to last. 'You were content to use him to fulfil needs in you.' 'Wholly wrong': A police mugshot of Ferneyhough . Katya Saudek, defending, told the court Ferneyhough had developed 'deep feelings' for the boy but was now 'utterly ashamed of her behaviour' and had paid a heavy price, losing her career. The court was told Ferneyhough had suffered abuse in previous relationships and the boy had been the 'first person who had been nice to her'. The judge conceded the boy may have been 'not just willing but enthusiastic' to have sex with her, but added: 'These laws exist to protect young people from themselves as much as they exist to protect them from predatory adults. 'This offending is so serious that only an immediate custodial sentence is appropriate for it.' PC Jayne Horsfall from Humberside .

'For the past few centuries, we [in the West] have defined beauty as tall, slender figures, femininity and white skin,' thundered model Cameron Russell in a recent talk for the TEDx series of lectures. 'This is a legacy that was built for me, and that I have been cashing in on.' Now, just weeks after the talk, which has already received 2.3 million Youtube views, the Victoria's Secret Angel, 26, has returned to the attack in a new interview with the Telegraph. Outspoken: The model during her TEDx talk in which she described herself as a 'pretty, skinny, white woman' Career: Despite appearing on the Victoria's Secret catwalk (left), she says modelling is 'not a career path' In it, she urges girls not to become models, describing it as 'not a career path' and criticises the effect that the relentless bombardment of images featuring young, skinny, white girls has on other women's self-esteem. She's also at pains to point out that even when you're as genetically blessed as she is, you don't always feel good about yourself. 'I have received all these benefits from a deck that is stacked in my favour, and it doesn't always make me happy,' she explains. 'If anyone were to think that looking like a model is the key to happiness, they just need to meet a group of models. 'Because they have the thinnest thighs, and the shiniest hair, and the coolest clothes, and are probably the most insecure group of women on the planet.' Video source TED . Backstage: Cameron with Snejana Onopka and Doutzen Kroes at a Karl Lagerfeld runway show in New York . Undue attention: Cameron says her views get more attention than they deserve because of her career . Russell, who has modelled for more than a decade and has worked for Calvin Klein, Prada and Armani as well as Victoria's Secret, has made more than $3million from her work according to Forbes magazine. She also admits to having gained countless advantages from her looks, despite describing herself as the beneficiary of a 'legacy of gender and racial oppression' during her TEDx talk. 'It's hard for me to see it these days,' she explains. 'You don't realise you are being treated differently, and you think maybe someone is being nice and altruistic, but it happens over and over again, and then you are with someone else and you realise it doesn't happen for them. 'I have no idea what advantages I truly get, but I know people talk to me and give me time of day because they like how I look.' She worries too about how her TEDx talk was received, worrying that it might perpetuate the white, skinny beauty ideal she hopes to tackle. 'I gave the talk because I wanted to tell an honest personal narrative of what privilege means,' she reveals. 'I work hard but my modelling career gives my views undeserved attention.' But while her views have certainly been attracting attention, as far as the women who feel under constant pressure to match up to unattainable ideals and many others are concerned, undeserved it is not.","The 26-year-old says models are just as insecure as other women .

A brother who branded his sister 'too lazy' to work forged his dying mother’s will to deny her a share of the fortune. Benefits dependent Christine Watts, 47, was accused of unreasonably fighting for half her mother's estate as she 'did nothing to get a job' for nine years while waiting for inheritance. But it has emerged her brother Gary, 44, forged their mother's signature on a deathbed will, which left Christine, of Eastbourne, East Sussex, nothing. Won: Christine Watts, 47, was accused of unreasonably fighting for half her mother's estate after finding she had been left with nothing. Today a judge ruled her brother Gary, 44, had forged the will to take the entire estate . When their mother Valerie died of cancer aged 71 in January . 2011, it emerged she made a last-minute amendment to the will, leaving . their entire £200,000 estate to her son. However, a court has found Mr Watts fabricated the document to get her life savings and the family home in Kent to himself. Rejecting the 2011 document in favour of a 1999 will, Judge Catherine Newman QC ruled Mr Watts had pressurised a nurse into bearing witness to the forged will. The siblings have now been granted half each. Judge Catherine Newman QC said: 'Gary signed it, not Valerie, and he simulated his mother’s signature on it.' Both siblings had been adopted by Valerie and her then-husband Leonard - Miss Watts from a children’s home in 1967 when she was 10 months old; Mr Watts three years later, before his first birthday. Mr Watts told the court he deserved every penny for the years he spent caring for their mother. The inheritance, to be split between the pair, amounts to £200,000 from a house in Kent and some savings . The judge said: 'His view was that he had got what he deserved, and so had Christine, and he did not think that she deserved to get anything from their mother’s estate.' But Miss Watts who has survived on benefits since giving up her work as an underwriter told the judge: 'I need money for living expenses.' Her counsel Jordan Holland had told the judge she had back problems and psychological issues which made it impossible for her to work. She was 'dependent' on her late mother even though she was an adult. She denied she had been waiting for her mother’s death to save her from dire financial straits. But Mr Watts' counsel Neil McLarnon accused her of not making any effort to find work. The court found Mr Watts enlisted the support of an aunt who showed 'animosity' to Christine to sign the will . She replied: ‘I feel that, if I take a job, I would not be able to commit to it because of taking time off sick and it wouldn’t be fair.’ Mr Watts told the court his mother first wanted to cut Miss Watts out of her will in 2006 but he persuaded her not to. He said the deathbed will was her 'final wish' because 'she was disappointed with her not showing any concern for her, not coming up and visiting her.' But one of the witnesses nurse Jackie Brown said she was tricked by Gary into signing the document, she never knew was a will and never saw Valerie sign it as required by law. The other witness to the will was Valerie’s sister Yvonne who was an 'unsatisfactory' witness who showed 'animosity' to Christine, and claimed her sister died 'heartbroken' because of her daughter’s failure to extend her any affection, said the judge. She claimed the 2011 will was what her sister wanted.","Judge ruled Gary Watts, 44, forged deathbed document to take all savings .

No vote: Miliband says Labour will only hold an EU referendum if Westminster is asked to hand over more power to Brussels . Ed Miliband faced an onslaught from both Tory and Labour Eurosceptics last night after effectively ruling out an EU referendum if he becomes prime minister. The Labour leader ended a year of dithering over the issue by announcing that he will refuse to match Prime Minister David Cameron’s pledge to hold an ‘in/out’ vote by 2017. He said Labour would only offer people a say in the event of a new EU treaty in which Westminster is asked to hand over more powers to Brussels, something even he admitted was ‘unlikely’ to happen. Mr Miliband’s stance brings Labour . policy into line with that of the Liberal Democrats, prompting . speculation he is preparing the ground for a potential coalition deal if . he fails to win a majority in next year’s general election. Tories . expressed delight, saying they could now tell voters only they were . prepared to offer the public their first say on EU membership for 40 . years in the next Parliament. They . also said it should now be obvious to Eurosceptic voters that backing . UKIP risks letting in a Labour government which will not hold a . referendum. A recent YouGov . poll found 62 per cent of Britons wanted a referendum, against 21 per . cent who did not. Among Labour voters, the figures were 49 per cent and . 33 per cent. Mr Cameron . said: ‘The British people now have a very, very clear choice. They can . elect a Tory government that will renegotiate Britain’s position in . Europe and give people a guaranteed in/out referendum by the end of . 2017. If they get a Labour government they get no referendum, no choice, . nothing.’ Labour MPs agitating for the party to back a vote attacked what one called a ‘shoddy compromise’. Meanwhile . one of the party’s biggest donors, John Mills, who is also chairman of . the Labour for a Referendum campaign, said: ‘I want to see a Labour . government in 2015 and, as the party that trusts the people, I think we . should recognise that the growth of the EU’s influence over Britain in . the past 40 years warrants a referendum.’ Labour MP Graham Stringer said: ‘It’s a . shoddy compromise, between those in the Parliamentary Labour Party who . want a referendum because the vast majority of the electorate want it, . and those desperate not to have a referendum.’ Labour sources claimed Mr Miliband had overruled senior figures including Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, police chief Jon Cruddas and former shadow Cabinet minister Tom Watson. Former Labour minister Kate Hoey, a Eurosceptic, said: ‘I think it’s meant to be a clever compromise, I don’t think it’s going to end up as one.’ Mr Miliband acknowledged concerns about the EU and said he would seek to return ‘more control to national parliaments’. His announcement divided business groups, with the Confederation of British Industry praising him for giving businesses certainty over Britain’s future in the EU but the Institute of Directors insisting a referendum must be held. Lord Mandelson, the former Labour business secretary, said: ‘I think it will be seen as quite a game-changer for Ed Miliband. He’s shown judgment, and courage.’ Former foreign secretary Jack Straw said: ‘This offers reassurance not only to business and millions of workers whose jobs depend on Europe but also allays the fears of those who are uncomfortable with moves towards ever closer union.’ But the chairman of the all-party Parliamentary group for an EU referendum, John Baron, said: ‘Labour has come up short. The leadership has all but said there will never be an in/out referendum on their watch. Only the Conservatives will be able to deliver such a referendum.’","Miliband has effectively ruled out an EU referendum if he wins election .

Danny Alexander is positioning himself as future Lib Dem leader if Nick Clegg is ousted after the next election, senior party figures claim. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury is seen as the leading candidate to stop left winger Tim Farron from seizing control. It comes amid renewed speculation about Mr Clegg's future, with his office saying he is only committed to stay until 2020 if he is still in government.' Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander is eying up a leadership bid to replace Nick Clegg . Mr Alexander today side-stepped questions about his ambitions, insisting ‘there isn't a vacancy for many years to come’. Mr Clegg, who delivered an upbeat speech at his party's conference in York today, is expected to quit as Lib Dem leader only if the party is not returned to government in a power-sharing deal with the Conservatives or Labour. Senior aides were today forced to insist that he would serve a full five-year term after the election, but only if he remains as Deputy Prime Minister. S spokesman for Mr Clegg said: 'Our entire focus is on delivering Lib Dem priorities in government and then getting Lib Dems back into government in 2015. 'Nick Clegg is very much enjoying being both Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the Lib Dems. He is only 47. 'It is for the British people to decide … and if the Lib Dems are back in government again Nick intends to serve a full term.’ However, it is possible that his resignation could also be a condition of one of the larger parties entering a coalition with the Lib Dems. Challenged about Mr Clegg's plans for the future, a senior Lib Dem source said: 'He wants to lead the Lib Dems into the next election and beyond into government. I think we should concentrate on getting re-elected and getting into government again.' Mr Farron, the party president, is seen as the front runner to beat for the leadership. But those on the right of the party are dismayed at prospect of being led by the Westmorland MP, whose comedy routines at conferences are thought to lack the gravitas needed to form a government. One Lib Dem MP said: ’I'm sure Putin will be very intimidated about this cheeky chappie telling jokes about Margaret Thatcher and the miners. Nick Clegg has vowed to continue as leader until 2020 only if he remains in government as Deputy Prime Minister . ’He would turn the party back into a glorified student union, organising petitions and drinking cider.’ Another said: ’Farron as leader? Shoot me now.’ Now Mr Alexander has emerged as the lead candidate from the right of the party, which has battled to reposition the Lib Dems as a serious party of government. Notably, Mr Alexander was one of only two senior minister name-checked by Mr Clegg in his conference speech. ’Danny is definitely positioning to challenge for leader,’ said a senior Lib Dem source. ’If there are two people in the race to replace Nick, it will be Farron and Danny.’ Admirers of the Scot note his recent attempts to shake off his reputation for being a closet Tory. Asked about his moves to become leader, Mr Alexander told Sky News: ‘There's no vacancy, I hope there isn't a vacancy for many years to come. Nick Clegg is doing a fantastic job, I've got a big job to do...’ Tory London Mayor Boris Johnson has hinted at his own leadership hopes by claiming he would be prepared to pick up the ball if it came loose from the scrum. Challenged over whether he would do the same, Mr Alexander said: ‘One thing the Liberal Democrats aren't is a loose scrum. Nick Clegg, I hope will be leader for many years to come and I think that focusing on the job in hand is always wise advice for anybody in politics.’ Mr Clegg has publicly denied his close friend had been ’taken hostage’ in the Treasury by Conservative Chancellor George Osborne. Mr Alexander has made a number of public interventions putting himself at odds with Tory policy, most notably declaring the 45p top rate of tax would be cut ’over my dead body’. In a speech today he accused the Conservatives of ’feebly’ trying to steal the Lib Dem policy of increasing the income tax threshold. Many Lib Dem MPs are dismayed at the idea of party president Tim Farron (right) becoming leader . Mr Alexander has recently stepped up attempts to help him lay claim to the economic growth which the Tories have insisted is the result of their thought decisions. He has also become a regular fixture on the ’rubber chicken’ circuit, speaking at Lib Dem constituency association dinners to raise his profile with grassroots activists who will choose the next leader. ’We have no big beasts,’ said a Lib Dem strategist keen to see Mr Alexander raise his profile. ’At the next election the only well known figures will be Clegg, (Vince) Cable and (Paddy) Ashdown. But Danny is getting there.’ One major obstacle to Mr Alexander’s leadership ambitions is his own slender majority. Today reports suggested he is being lined up to replace Vince Cable as the party’s main economic spokesman. But Mr Cable insisted it was ’presumptuous’ to assume what jobs people would have on the election campaign next year.","Chief Secretary to the Treasury emerges as frontrunner to succeed Clegg .

Sheriff Principal Derek Pyle held a six-week inquiry after 14 oil workers and two crew died when a Bond Super Puma plunged into the water off the Aberdeenshire coast on April 1, 2009. It found that Bond had failed to perform a task from the aircraft maintenance manual just days before on March 25 - after a metal particle was discovered on the helicopter's epicyclic chip detector. Scroll down for video . Deaths: The 14 oil workers and two crew who died when a helicopter plunged into the water (top row, from left): James Costello, Vernon Elrick, Brian Barkley, Raymond Doyle, (second row, from left) Warren Mitchell, Gareth Hughes, David Rae, Nairn Ferrier, (third row, from left) Stuart Wood, Richard Menzies, James Edwards, Alex Dallas, (bottom row, from left) Leslie Taylor, Nolan Carl Goble, Paasul Burnham and Mihails Zuravskis . Bond also failed to ensure that communications with the manufacturer Eurocopter were done according to procedure, with the result that ‘misunderstandings arose between the parties’. It also failed to identify what the metal particle was during maintenance, the report said. A witness had said how the helicopter fell from the sky ‘like a torpedo’, followed by its detached rotor blades. An Air Accidents Investigation Branch probe found that the aircraft suffered a ‘catastrophic failure’ of its main rotor gearbox - and its ‘tail boom’ was severed from the fuselage. The crash claimed the lives of captain and co-pilot Paul Burnham, 31, from Methlick in Aberdeenshire, and Richard Menzies, 24, from Droitwich Spa in Worcestershire. Investigation: Wreckage from the helicopter being brought ashore after the Bond Super Puma plunged into the water off the Aberdeenshire coast in April 2009 . Five men from Aberdeen died: Alex . Dallas, 62, James Costello, 24, Stuart Wood, 27, Vernon Elrick, 41, and . Brian Barkley, 30; and two workers were from Aberdeenshire: Leslie .

In . his findings, Sheriff Pyle said: ‘The essential fact is that everyone . in the company well knew that maintenance must be done by the book. On . one occasion, that fundamental rule was broken.' Probe: Wreckage being brought ashore in 2009, as an inquiry finds that the crash might have been avoided . The families of the men who died have called for the Crown Office to review its decision not to pursue a criminal prosecution against Bond.

But British strawberries could soon be available all year round, thanks to pioneering new technology which will help them grow out of season. Experts have developed new LED lighting for greenhouses which fool strawberry plants into thinking that it is spring rather than winter. Sweet news: British strawberries could soon appear in supermarkets all year round . The red and blue lights are low-energy, meaning they use less electricity than artificial white lights which are sometimes used by greenhouses. It means the strawberry plants can be kept in artificial light for a lower cost, according to researchers at Stockbridge Technology Centre in Selby, North Yorkshire. Wallings Nursery in Essex plans to use the technology this year to ripen up to 30 tonnes of fruit that it would normally have thrown away after the plants died back in the autumn. The nursery is one of the biggest suppliers of British strawberries and the extra crop from the three-hectare site is estimated to be worth Â£100,000. Bumper harvest: Wallings Nursery in Essex plans to use the technology this year to ripen up to 30 tonnes of fruit that it would normally have thrown away . Currently, British strawberries are usually sold in supermarkets between the months of April and November . Peter Czarnobaj, product technologist of soft fruit at Sainsbury's, which helped to fund the research, said the aim was to offer British strawberries 'all year round.' Currently, British strawberries are usually sold in supermarkets between the months of April and November. Researchers at Sainsbury's found that almost 80 per cent of its customers preferred to buy British produce, up from 55 per cent six years ago. The supermarket giant hopes to double sales of food sourced in Britain in the next seven years. Research has shown that the country is less self-sufficient in its production of fruit and vegetables than ten years ago. More than half the cauliflowers, celery and cucumbers eaten here in 2012 were grown elsewhere. The awful weather two summers ago meant Britain grew only 56 per cent of its needs. The quantities of most native apple varieties grown in the UK have fallen by more than half since 1985, with the volume of Cox's orange pippin dropping from 83,400 tonnes to 32,000 tonnes. Peter Kendall, the outgoing president of the National Farmers Union, appealed to British shoppers in a new year's message to 'seek out high-quality British products'. He added: 'By forming a long-term pact between consumers, retailers, food service and farmers, we can deliver the sustainable farming that is going to be vital to feed the UK's rapidly growing population.'","British strawberries could soon appear in supermarkets all year round .

A cinemagoer who buys a large popcorn and fizzy drink could consume their entire week's sugar at once . Cinemas have been slammed for selling supersize snacks, amid evidence one box of popcorn can contain up to 35 teaspoons of sugar. Professor Susan Jebb, the Government’s obesity tsar, yesterday called on the chains to offer clear nutrition information, smaller packs and healthy alternatives. Last week the World Health Organisation suggested maximum sugar intake should be limited to as few as six teaspoons a day. This means a cinemagoer who buys a large popcorn and fizzy drink could be consuming their entire week’s sugar allowance in just one sitting. A 200g box of toffee popcorn at Cineworld comes in at 840 calories and 121g of sugar, equivalent to about 30 teaspoons. Adding a 32oz Coca Cola carries an extra 407 calories and 101.2g of sugar, or 25 teaspoons. A large bucket of sweet popcorn at Odeon cinemas amounts to 1,005 calories, which is more than half of a woman’s recommended daily intake. And at Vue, a 200g tub of toffee popcorn contains 138.9g of sugar, which is equivalent to about 35 teaspoons. Professor Jebb, chairman of the Government’s Public Health Responsibility Deal Food Network, said she was concerned about the ‘excessive sizes’ of cinema snacks and drinks, adding: ‘High street food chains, caterers as well as entertainment companies all have a role to play to make it easier for people to make healthy choices. ‘The least they should do is provide clear information on calories.’ Weight Watchers has joined demands for the three biggest chains, Odeon, Cineworld and Vue, to ban supersized portions of sugary drinks and popcorn. As part of its ‘Slim Our Snacks’ campaign, the diet group has called for customers to be able to weigh pick and mix sweets before purchase to get an idea of the calories and sugar, and said fruit should be offered as a healthy option. It also urged cinemas to stop advertising supersize portions as ‘better value’ deals. Weight Watchers spokesman Angharad Massie said: ‘Cinemas are inherently family focused spaces, yet we all recognise them to be one of the worst spaces for promoting portions of high fat, salt and sugar snacks with little or no choice of healthier alternatives.’ Cinemas do display nutrition but Weight Watchers blast them as one of the worst spaces for promoting portions of high fat, salt and sugar snacks with few options for healthy alternatives . The cinemas do display nutrition information on their websites, with Vue also putting calories on menu boards at the tills. A Cineworld spokesman said it had trialled healthy choices such as fruit and nuts in the past but these had proved unpopular with customers, adding: ‘The cinema experience is seen as a treat by most people.’ Despite this, the chain is testing a smaller 16oz cup for fizzy drinks, which may soon be rolled out across its cinemas. Both Cineworld and Vue said visitors were welcome to bring their own snacks. No one at Odeon was available for comment.","Large boxes can contain up to 140g sugar, 6 times recommended amount .

The big four supermarkets have lost sales worth £4.4billion a year -  squeezed on one side by budget stores, Aldi and Lidl, and upmarket Waitrose on the other. The unprecedented switch has occurred over the last three years and comes against the background of a punishing cost of living crisis. Aldi’s sales growth has accelerated to a remarkable 33.5per cent a year, while takings through the tills at Lidl are rising by an impressive 16.5per cent. The big four supermarkets, including Tesco, have lost sales worth £4.4billion a year -  squeezed on one side by budget stores, Aldi and Lidl, and upmarket Waitrose on the other . The huge rise in shoppers and sales means Aldi’s share of UK grocery sales is now running at 4.3per cent, while the Lidl share is 3.2per cent. These figures may appear small, but they are taking a huge chunk of sales from middle-market supermarkets like Tesco, Morrisons and Asda. The budget chains have made a concerted effort to target middle Britain shoppers who have seen prices rise faster than incomes for the last five years. Fresh fillet steak, produce, cheap dairy products and award winning European food and wine have seen their car parks packed with BMWs and Volvos. Tesco’s market share over the last 12 weeks compared to a year ago is down from 29.6per cent to 28.7per cent, while Morrisons is down from 11.8per cent and Asda from 17.8per cent to 17.5per cent. Tesco and Morrisons have responded to the threat posed by the so-called ‘hard discounters’ by launching a price war on milk and some other essentials. Tesco has cut the price of a four pint carton to £1 to match budget chains, while Morrisons has cut the price of a two litre carton to 84p, which is 24p a pint. Aldi¿s sales growth has accelerated to a remarkable 33.5per cent a year . Meanwhile takings through the tills at Lidl are rising by an impressive 16.5per cent . The figures come from analysts, Kantar Worldpanel, whose director, Chris Longbottom, said: ‘Aldi’s year-on-year growth rate accelerated to a record 33.5per cent meaning the retailer now accounts for 4.3per cent of the market while Lidl held on to the record 3.2per cent it reached last period. 'Despite this, Waitrose shrugged off the pressure from the discounters with its highest ever market share of 5per cent. ‘Over the past three years Waitrose, Aldi and Lidl have taken a combined 3.5 share points from the competition which equates to £4.4 billion per year. ‘This has put pressure on the big four supermarkets to compete for a shrinking middle ground and cut prices to directly combat the discounters.’ Among the big four, Sainsbury’s was the only retailer to hold its market share year-on-year at 17.0% and match the overall market growth of 2.2per cent. The Co-operative has improved on historical performance with positive sales growth of 0.7% and only a marginal drop in share to 6.1per cent. Kantar said grocery prices are rising at an annual rate of 1.9per cent, which is the lowest level since July 2010 and so offers some respite for hard-pressed household budgets.","Aldi’s sales growth has accelerated to .

'As soon as I came over to the UK I saw an ice cream van and knew that was what I wanted to do. 'I worked for someone else at the start, but I eventually managed to save up enough and bought my own van in 1971 and haven't looked back since. ' I picked the name Tonino & Son because it's an Italian name but it's a bit easier to pronounce than mine. 'I'll never forget that I used to charge 4d for a cone with a flake. Now it's £1.50, but I think that's pretty reasonable. 'I must have sold more than two million ice creams during my career. I've had a blast, I really have.' He said: 'We used to be out all year but things have changed. We have had hard times and good but have survived them all and are still going.

Ms Salamone was hailed by the Guinness Book or Records after his ten-year-old grandson Ethan Edwards spotted he had beaten the previous record-holder beat by a decade. He is now handing over the keys to his fleets of vans to son Alberto and Neil Edwards and Pierro Lerede, the husbands of his two daughters Santy and Adriana. The grandfather added: 'I will miss the people - I have been here since the 60s and have served grandmothers, mothers, children and their children. It has been a pleasure.'

Proud son-in-law Neil Edwards said: 'Retiring is something Paul has been talking about for a while, but he'll never completely stop. 'He shared his secret ice cream and iced lolly recipes with me, which I think was a big step. 'Ice cream may not be as popular as it once was, but the fact that our family company is still going is testament to the love the British public have to reliable service with a friendly smile - something Paul prides himself on very much. 'We'll still let him out in a van every now and again. He loves the people and they love him.' Their tinkling chimes once brought armies of children running from their homes, pocket money at the ready to buy their favourite frozen treat. But after feeding generations of confectionery hungry youngsters, the fortunes of Britain's ice cream vans seems to be stalling. The rise in popularity of the home freezer - introduced in the 1950s - and new EU rules insisting on lower emission limits means that many of the country's 5,000 ice cream vans have been frozen out and consigned to the scrap heap. The costly amendments to keep them on the road add to the already expensive trade which includes insurance and a trade licence costing around £800 annually. A recent report claimed that  there are only 500 ice cream vans left on the roads. In their 1970s heyday, there were 250,000.","Paul Salamone, 75, has been behind wheel of ice cream since 1965 .

Living on the edge: Mary Berry is going against the British tradition and serves her cheese before dessert . For decades she has been hailed as the definitive guide to traditional food. But when it comes to the order in which it is eaten, Mary Berry is rather less conventional. And shortly after she declared on her new BBC Two show Mary Berry Cooks that she insists on following the French and serving her cheese before dessert, it quickly became apparent she had divided opinion between viewers and not all of them agreed. Miss Berry announced on her Monday night show: ‘At my dinner parties i like to serve cheese after the main course because you still have red wine in the glass and it goes very well with the cheese. And that is what they do in France and I think they set a good example.’ And the queen of Bake Off added: ‘I also like to bring my dinner party to a spectacular close by serving the dessert.’ One of the first to respond on social networking site Twitter yesterday was BBC Radio 4 presenter Jane Garvey who said: ‘It’s the morning after Mary Berry said she serves cheese before pudding. Nothing will ever be quite the same again. #dinner party’. Disagreeing with the 78-year-old host, another fan said: ‘Cheese before pudding? Is Mary Berry mad??’ Another added: ‘Serving cheese before pudding? Corr she’s a cheeky one.’ Backing Miss Berry and criticising the unrefined pallets of the British, celebrity chef Theo Randall ,said: ‘It is a very continental way of dinning to eat the cheese before desert, and to be honest the French do have to right idea. ‘It is much more refined to finish with a sweet pallet because it is the way a meal should progress. Often the wine served for previous courses can be enjoyed in the cheese course. ‘I think the Brits could learn something from the Europeans and therefore conclude their meals properly, and enjoy their dessert.’ Mr Randall, who runs an award-winning restaurant at the InterContinental hotel in London said the tradition for the British to consume cheese last stems from the home grown art of port-making: ‘It became very much a social thing to move away from the table and hack away at the stilton and crack open the port after pudding. ‘Although we probably don’t dish out the port as quickly today, the tradition of having cheese last has stuck. But if you go to any restaurant, which leans to the refines of continental dining you will always see the cheese trolley wheeled out before dessert.’ Continental and controversial: Mary Berry said she prefers to served the cheese before the pudding as cheese often goes with the red wine still in the glass from the main course . The cheese course is originally thought to have started in Russia and was later introduced by the French before dessert. According to experts serving cheese before dessert enables guests to pair the wine that accompanies the entrée with milder cheeses before moving on to blue cheeses which works well with the sweet and fortified wines that can them accompany dessert. Another theory is that as the French traditionally serve salad with vinaigrette after the main the cheese acts as a ‘neutraliser’ to cleanse the palate before dessert is served. Flying the flag for home traditions, Camilla Schneideman from the Leith School of Food and Wine, claimed the Brits choose to eat cheese last because it is more sociable. She said: ‘The Brits traditionally choose to serve their cheese last, it is often the natural move away from the sweet course and allows dinners to continue to enjoy the evenings wine. ‘Traditionally the French would serve the cheese before, but for many UK dinner parties it is often a social decision to serve after. ‘Many hosts believe their dinner party will stay longer if they are grazing over a cheese board at the end of the meal.’ Miss Berry, CBE studied at Le Cordon Bleu school in France, before working in a number of cooking related jobs. She has published more than 70 cookery books and hosted several television series for the BBC and Thames Television. The star is an occasional contributor to Woman’s Hour and Saturday Kitchen and has been a judge on the BBC Two television programme The Great British Bake Off since its launch in 2010.","Mary Berry follows French tradition of serving cheese first .

French black truffles can sell for £200 per lb, but chefs in France have been accused of using Chinese truffles in their place, which sell for just £12 per lb . They are notoriously difficult to grow, even more difficult to dig up, and at £200 per lb, they are one of the most expensive foods in the world. French black truffles, also known as 'black diamonds', are so in-demand that even celebrity chefs have to use them sparingly. So it should come as no surprise to learn that unscrupulous eateries are conning consumers by spraying cheap Chinese varieties with chemicals then passing them off as the real deal. Asian truffles, which are lighter and much more common than their French equivalent, can cost as little as £12 per lb. Because truffles are now so rare and are added to dishes in such tiny amounts it makes the practice easy to get away with, complain trufficulteurs - as the food's connoisseurs are known. The French Federation of Trufficulteurs (FTT) is calling for better education on truffle varieties and new legislation on labelling to stop customers being ripped off. An investigation by a French consumer watchdog in 2012 found that between ten and 15 per cent of truffles claiming to be of the exclusive Peringord variety were actually cheap imports. Peringord truffles are the second most expensive in the world, after the Italian Alba variety which can fetch £2,300 per lb. The French fungus, which grows around the roots of oak, hazel and lime trees, used to be more common, but as farmers deserted the countryside for cities and two world wars destroyed the fungi's natural habitat, they became scarce. Truffles are difficult to grow and even trickier to find - usually requiring trained sniffer dogs or pigs . Throughout France the few truffle farms that still exist produce just 50 tonnes of them annually, with roughly another 25 tonnes imported from China. The FTT is now introducing a programme to help the 20,000 French truffle-growers increase production by handing over around £200,000 annually to increase production. Growers themselves have agreed to plant roughly 300,000 to 400,000 trees every year that the fungi are known to grow around, though it can take up to ten years for the new wooded areas to produce the delicacy. Truffles may be expensive but they are by no means the most expensive food in the world. Prized beluga caviar, made from the eggs of the beluga sturgeon, sells for around £5,000 per lb, and is so valuable that the fish are periodically given ultrasound scans to check how the eggs are doing. Spanish saffron, made from the stoma of crocus flowers, sells for around the same amount. It is pricey because it takes a patch of crocuses roughly the size of a football pitch to produce one lb which must all be picked by hand.","French black truffles are a delicacy sell for around £200 per lb .

Total UK sales have fallen by 6.2 per cent in the last two years, which means the nation is eating some 423million fewer sausages a year. The industry puts the fall down to the rise in the cost of pork, which is now at an historic high, taking the cost of a pack of sausages up by some 12.5per cent in a year. Sales of sausages have fallen in the UK by 6.2 per cent in the last two years, which means the nation is eating some 423million fewer sausages a year . Some value packs of sausages have risen even more steeply at the big supermarket chains. For example, a pack of eight Sainsbury's British Cumberland Sausages is up from £1 to £1.40 over the past nine months. However, other factors such as renewed health concerns about the impact of eating red meat may also have led some families to cut back. The slow decline of sausage sales comes as families and children increasingly switch to imported fast food options such as pizza, pasta and curry. The pork sausage is a particularly British delicacy, however it has had its critics over the years given concerns over the rather grim ingredients and gristle that have been used in some products. The industry has responded to this by producing a raft of new gourmet versions flavoured with herbs and fruit. The problems of sausage sales have been revealed by Devro, the Scottish maker of the collagen skins that are used as cases for sausages, chipolatas, salamis, and bratwurst. Shoppers have increasingly turned either to the lowest-cost brands from budget chains, or to top-end 'black tray' sausages that are encased in traditional animal gut . Chief executive, Peter Page, said Britons have particularly lost the taste for mid-market brands such as supermarket own label creations, where sales were down 7per cent in the past two years. Nearly three-quarters of UK households still buy sausages, according to research for the industry group, BPEX, and Kantar World Panel. However, shoppers have increasingly turned either to the lowest-cost brands from budget chains, or to top-end 'black tray' sausages that are encased in traditional animal gut. Sales through the likes of Aldi and Lidl, where prices for sausages appear at least 10per cent cheaper, are up by around 24per cent in two years. Shares in Devro – which makes enough casing to stretch several times around the world – fell by 9 per cent on Tuesday, after the company said demand for sausages had been subdued. But while the British may be cutting back on sausages, the picture is very different in China where pork consumption is growing rapidly among the burgeoning middle class. Devro is spending £50m constructing a plant in China which will start production in 2016 amid expectations that the country will make up half of global sausage consumption within a few years. It is believed that the sausage was first brought to these shores by the Romans around 400AD. The word derives from the Latin salsisium, meaning something that has been salted. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first specific reference in English came in a fifteenth century vocabulary publication, which described the 'sawsage'. It was in the reign of Charles I that sausages were divided into links for the first time in Britain. Once made, they were put up chimneys in the home to be mildly cured. Each region developed their own methods of manufacture and flavours with butchers in Lincolnshire favouring fresh sage and those in Cheshire using caraway and coriander. Today, the industry calculates there are more than 470 recipes. They came to be known as bangers during the Second World War. This was because their high water content meant that they were liable to explode when cooked as the water turned to steam. BPEX said while the number of sausages sold is down, the value of sales is up by around £70million over the last two years to some £773million. This is partly because of the higher cost of pork, but also because families are opting for gourmet creations. Director Mick Sloyan insisted the sausage is still a family essential. 'Research has shown people are trading up from value sausages to premium sausages which are becoming a main meal item. 'That shift is part of the reason for the increase in value as people look for better quality.'","The industry puts the fall down to the rise in the cost of pork .

It is an advertising slogan that has stood the test of time, and made its way into the consciousness of an entire nation. But the days of baking giants Mr Kipling referring to its cakes as 'exceedingly good' could be coming to an end amidst a multi-million pound rebrand. The famous phrase, which featured in some way in virtually every TV advert, poster and piece of packaging since 1967, could be scrapped as the brand draws up new designs and shifts its focus towards individual 'snack pack' items. Classic: The 'exceedingly good' catchphrase has been featured for decades. The advert above aired in 1985 . Enduring: The phrase, first used in 1967, helped make Mr Kipling the nation's biggest cake-maker. Above is an advert continuing the tradition in 1997 . Gavin Darby, the chief executive of Premier Foods, which owns the Kipling brand, said he was 'on the verge' of replacing the slogan as part of £20million of new investment. When asked whether the phrase - which is sometimes spoken by the mysterious Mr Kipling and sometimes about him - could be dropped, he said: 'It's possible. Well, we'll see. We're on the verge of agreeing the TV commercial. Mr Kipling's range including bakewell . tarts and fruit slices, have been the bestselling cake brand in Britain . for almost 40 years. Earlier ads centred on Mr Kipling, a kindly uncle figure, inviting people to his house to test his new creations which were, invariably, dubbed 'exceedingly good'. The original voice featured in the article belonged to Barry Linehan's, who died of cancer in 1996. His ten-year stint on the commercial saw sales boom. At time of his death, long-time friend Brian McDermott said: 'Everyone called him Mr Kipling and his voice was his trademark. He had a successful career and was much more than just a voice.' Refresh: The brand's packaging and style has gone through many changes, but has always retained the central phrase. Pictured above is a 2012 version . Beloved: The phrase has worked its way into the popular imagination, thanks to its long-running association. Above is Mr Kipling packaging bearing the slogan in 2003 . Seasonal: Variants of the phrase were used for other products, such as these 2004 mince pies . Later versions, including a 1984 Christmas ad, saw Mr Kipling made the victim of his own success when so many carol singers gathered at his house, lured in by his mince pies, that he couldn't get them to leave. The campaigns took a more humorous direction in the early 2000s, which saw Mr Kipling made into a more accident-prone figure. Despite making gaffes including filling a bouncy castle with helium so that it flew away, and making a live birth the centrepiece of a nativity play, Mr Kipling was forgiven because of the quality of his baking. The man himself has never been pictured in any of the adverts, though occasional silhouettes have featured. Six in ten British households bought a Mr Kipling product last year. #heritage: The slogan survived into the social media age, as seen in the advert from last Christmas . Memories: Strong feelings have been raised by the prospect of change from such a household brand, shown above in 1994 . But . a financial crisis at Premier Foods, which also owns Ambrosia and . Hovis, in the last few years has seen a lack of advertising and . marketing budget spent on the brand. Mr . Darby added: 'The cake category is our focus for 2014. This has been . the brand that's been the casualty of Premier having no money. 'It's a £1billion category and we've invested almost nothing in advertising and very little in new product development.' 'We're going to have new packaging, new advertising and doubling of our capacity to produce Mr Kipling snack packs, which is where we're getting a lot of our growth.' But fans of the cakes have already taken to social media sites to voice their anger at the dropping of the slogan. One said: 'That famous voice and advertising slogan very often made me buy Mr Kipling cakes. Abandoning it seems unnecessary (and therefore unwise).' Another said: 'Premier Foods' senior managers are a bunch of t**spots. They have no idea of the value of their intellectual property.'","Mr Kipling cakes first described as 'exceedingly good' in 1967 .

With spring in the air, many women will already be fretting about getting in shape for  the summer. But if you are among the millions who dread having to uncover unsightly stretch marks on your bikini body, help is at hand. A revolutionary scar treatment that claims to reduce the appearance of the white streaks by half in less than a month has just become available on the high street. Remescar, which has been developed by scientists in Belgium, works by covering the scar or stretch mark in a thin, invisible film of silicone. This protects the top layer of skin in its own healing ‘micro-environment’, sealing in moisture and helping stimulate the production of collagen, which boosts the skin’s recovery. The treatment, which comes in a cream or handy deodorant-style stick, also includes beta glucan, a naturally occurring plant or yeast extract which has a proven protective and hydrating effect on wounds, and powerful SPF15 UV filters to shield against sun damage. In clinical trials, users who applied it twice a day said they noticed a 50 per cent reduction in the appearance of their stretch marks in only 28 days. Patients with both existing and new scars, caused by minor surgery, burns, acne or accidents, who used the treatment, also reported a reduction in the length and height of their scarring. They said the treatment helped to restore their skin to a more normal colour and texture, helping scars to fade and diminish. Sensations of burning, tingling and itching were  also reduced. Nine in ten British women are affected by stretch marks. Although pregnancy is one of the most common causes, they can also affect teenagers and young women who have not yet started a family. Nine in ten women are affected by stretch marks caused by pregnancy or weight fluctuations . Growth spurts and weight fluctuations can result in marks on the thighs and ‘love handles’, much to the distress of bikini-wearers. Men can also become victims, with affected areas including the arms, legs and back. Remescar is on sale from £19.95 for a 5.4g stick in Boots. A 100ml cream will also be available for £24.95. It is the first time that an easy-to-apply silicone treatment has been made available to the general public in Britain. Traditional, professional silicone gel or sheet treatments for scars can often cause embarrassment to patients because they are visible to others. The cream has been hailed as a revelation as traditional silicone gels can be embarrassing and visible . They are more expensive and can be difficult for the user to apply. Lucy Palmer, 32, from Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex, began using Remescar for scarring caused by teenage acne and chicken pox. ‘For years I wished my complexion was better,’ she said. ‘I was thinking about having the scars softened with laser surgery until I was fortunate enough to be chosen for the trials  for Remescar. ‘I cannot believe how effective it has been. My acne scarring almost halved in just eight weeks and is continuing to fade as the weeks go on. ‘I also tried it on my stretch marks after having my second child and the improvement is unbelievable, better than anything I’ve tried before.’ Remescar, from £19.95, is available at Boots .","Product hailed as non-embarrassing alternative to traditional methods .

The supercomputer that beat Jeopardy's greatest champs has now been put to use brainstorming innovative recipes to be served from an IBM food truck to customers eager for something new. Watson already impressed visitors at a Las Vegas tech conference last week by devising recipes like Swiss-Thai asparagus quiche and Austrian chocolate burrito. The next stop is Austin's South by Southwest Festival, where Watson will continue making odd but delicious dishes like pork belly moussaka as IBM works to fit the technology into a convenient app that anyone can use. Scroll down for video... Supercomputer, super chef: IBM has put its famous Jeopardy champ supercomputer Watson to use whipping up cutting edge recipes for its food truck tour . IBM programmers basically tweaked Watson to make into a super sous chef, writes The Salt. Chefs begin by inputting a main ingredient (for instance: apples) and a regional cuisine such as Eastern Europe. Watson then flips through a nearly endless database of recipes. Using its bank of food chemistry knowledge and, astoundingly, human tastes, Watson then pairs the main ingredient with other far less likely ingredients. The offbeat list of ingredients Watson spits out may not always sound delicious--suggesting apples has coaxed Watson to produce the offbeat garlicky, pork loin-laced Baltic Apple Pie--but it's the taste that matters. 'It has driven up some flavor pairings . that we would not have thought of,' James Briscione, one of the chefs . working with Watson and IBM, told The Salt. 'But we haven't come across . an instance yet where something didn't taste good.' Another . recipe devised by Watson was the pork belly moussaka, which calls for . cottage cheese, red bell peppers, dill, pork belly and cheddar cheese. 'I said, ""No freaking way! This sounds horrible,""' said Briscione. But it tasted great. 'Everyone who tasted it had to say, ""Wow.""' Pork belly apple pie, anyone? Chefs input a main ingredient and Watson pumps out a list of other ingredients that sound weird, but that science says tastes absolutely delicious . CAYMANIAN PLANTAIN DESSERT . Et voila! Chef's enter a main ingredients and a regional cuisine of their choice . Milk: 255 g, divided . Butter: 44 G, divided . Molasses: 28 g . Pure Vanilla Extract: 1 tsp . Nutmeg: 0.3 g .

In addition to the billions or trillions of combinations Watson can come up with, having the chefs there to decide how to use the ingredients makes for even more possibilities. 'Two different chefs can get the same list of ingredients and come up with completely different dishes,' Briscione said. The chef isn't afraid of losing his job to the supercomputer, though. He tells The Salt that sometimes a list of ingredients will have all the best flavors but none of that all-important aspect of a great dish, texture. 'You can end up with a list of ingredients, and none of them has an element of crispiness,' he said. IBM is showing off Watson's diverse skill sets as position themselves to make the Sueprcomputer's benefits available to businesses and individuals. 'Creative computing': IBM hopes to turn Watson's giant computer mind into a repository of trillions of possible recipe combinations you can access from an app . The Armonk, New York company said their new Manhattan-based business unit devoted soley to Watson will be dedicated to the development and commercialization of the project that first gained fame by defeating a pair of ‘Jeopardy!’ champions, including 74-time winner Jennings, in 2011. In the years since Watson's TV appearance, IBM has been developing the supercomputer for more practical purposes and changed it to a cloud-based service. Its massive computing capabilities once took a device the size of a room, but Watson is now that size of three stacked pizza boxes, according to BetaNews. IBM says Watson is unique because it it's programed like traditional computers and uses artificial intelligence to learn from its past experiences and factor that information into its future operations. More practical than Jeopardy: IBM has been thinking big when it comes to Watson and since its 2011 Jeopardy win against champs including Ken Jennings, they've created a Manhattan-based arm of the company specifically geared toward putting the supercomputer to use for businesses and consumers . Small but powerful: Its massive computing capabilities once took a device the size of a room, but Watson is now that size of three stacked pizza boxes . ‘IBM has transformed Watson from a quiz-show winner, into a commercial cognitive computing breakthrough that is helping businesses engage customers, healthcare organizations personalize patient care, and entrepreneurs build businesses,’ said Michael Rhodin, who will head the new Watson Group. IBM CEO Ginni Rometty said that Watson is built for a world where big data is transforming every industry and every profession. ‘Watson does more than find the needle in the haystack,’ Rometty said in remarks released ahead of the Watston Group's unveiling. ‘It understands the haystack. It understands context.’ As part of its investment, IBM is building a new headquarters for the business on the edge of New York City's East Village near New York University and other technology companies. About $100 million will go toward investing in startup companies that are building apps to be run through Watson.","IBM is now using the computer that beat champion Ken Jennings to think up unique dishes that are actually served to customers .

Research: Jane Atherton has been developing her beauty products for more than three years . Many women dread the menopause and fear it may leave them feeling old and past their prime. It was a feeling skin therapist Jane Atherton, now 53, experienced when she started undergoing the change. She said: 'Around two years ago I started having various unfamiliar physical and emotional symptoms. Hot flushes, sleepless nights and erratic periods were not things I was used to in my daily routine. At one stage it crossed my mind that I could be pregnant, and then my hypochondriac self, started to believe I might have some serious illness. 'So I went to see my doctor who very calmly informed me, that I was in fact going through the menopause. My first reaction was - thank the lord I'm not pregnant, my second was, what! No, wait, surely this can't be happening yet. I'm too young to be that old!' Once she had gotten over the shock of being a 'certain age' Jane, from London, fully researched the topic so she would be fully aware of the changes her body was going through and how she could aid the transition through diet and exercise. She shared her findings in a book published in 2012 called The Menopause Secret. During her research, one area where Jane found menopausal women were overlooked was in the skincare market. This concerned her as maintaining a youthful appearance and glowing skin can be key to helping a woman feel confident as she goes through the menopause. She told MailOnline: 'An issue that came to my . attention during my menopause was the lack of specific skin care products . to deal with my changing skin needs. There are many skin creams on the . market but none specifically aimed at skin care concerns during . menopause - they need to be rich in bio-hormones to replace lost . oestrogen, which is the main cause of ageing during this time. 'Up to 30 per cent . of collagen is lost in the first five years after menopause due to lack of . oestrogen, resulting in wrinkles, dryness and pigmentation problems. 'We have a high concentration of . oestrogen receptors in the face and this is where the symptoms of the . menopause may be at their most visible. I was concerned the products out . there were not addressing these needs.' Using her background in cosmetics and expertise as a skin therapist, Jane decided to develop her own products specifically designed for hormonally changing skin. Anti-ageing: Pause Hydra Creme costs £128 a bottle . After three years, she is now ready to launch the first product from her Phytomone skin and spa therapy range. It's called Pause Hydra Creme and doesn't come cheap at £128 a bottle. However it offers some value for money as a multi-purpose product - it can be used as a moisturiser, serum, eye cream and neck cream. The product is currently only available through the company's online store but Jane is in talks with several cosmetics companies in the hope of getting it into High Street shops soon. The cream contains vitamins, minerals and essential oils to help rejuvenate skin and SPF filters to protect from ageing UVA/B rays. Jane explains: 'We wanted to start with a good base, which meant choosing oils for their rich plant hormone content, such as flaxseed, soya, grape-seed and wheat-germ. We then added wild yam, sage, aloe vera and geranium essential oil, all very popular ingredients used to treat menopause symptoms and vitamins B, C and E for skin repair. 'We could have stopped here, and this would have been a very good moisturiser – but that is all it would have been, a moisturiser, the same as hundreds of different moisturisers out there now.PHC is more than a moisturiser – it’s a treatment product. So, to this basic moisturiser, we added some very special actives, all specifically chosen and blended into the formulation very precisely to addresses the needs of hormonally changing skin.' Beauty boost: Jane said the product meets the needs of women as their skin loses more collagen during the menopause . In clinical trials, Jane reports that 95 per cent of women noticed a significant reduction in lines and wrinkles in just four weeks using the cream. And despite it being developed for menopausal women, she said women shouldn't wait for the onset of symptoms to use the product. The average age women in the UK go through the menopause is 52 but some experience it much earlier. As a result, Jane said women could benefit from using it in their thirties. She explains: 'Many women don't realise that hormones can start to fluctuate as early as 35, though they would not necessarily connect this to menopause at this age. 'Up until this time your skin has a plentiful supply of collagen, which is why you don't see young people with wrinkles. After this age oestrogen starts to decline bringing with it the associated skin care concerns. So I would recommend women start using this cream from around this age.'

Pride and joy: Elizabeth I was famous for her manicured nails as were members of China's Ming Dynasty . Beloved of royal ladies such as the famously beautiful Nefertiti, the earliest manicures involved rubbing oil and incense into the hands before painting the nails with herbal strengthening potions and colouring them using henna. The earliest Chinese royals, and the Ming Dynasty that followed, were also fans of painted nails, with a bizarre-sounding mixture of wax, egg whites, gelatin and rubber used to dye the fingertips crimson and black. Ancient Babylonians living in what is now modern Iraq are also known to have loved and cared for their nails, with the world's oldest manicure set - made from solid gold and dated to 3,200 BC - discovered in the country. In the UK and elsewhere in Europe, possessing neat, manicured nails became a mark of affluence during the medieval and Tudor periods, while Elizabeth I was widely feted for her beautiful hands. Bizarre: Some unusual nail care has proved popular in the past, including using gelatin on the nails . Bright spark: Bold hot pink and red were enormously popular in the 1980s and paired with power dressing . But not all parts of the modern . manicure set are so old: The emery board, now a staple part of the kit, . wasn't invented until 1830 when an American doctor named Sits created . the first one. The cheap and . cheerful nail care system he later devised quickly spread around the . world, forming the basis for the elaborate looks that make up much of . author Suzanne E. Shapiro's tome. Shapiro, a researcher at The . Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, charts the manicure's progress from basic grooming to serious style statement, taking in fabulous photos by 20th Century greats Helmut Newton, Nikolas Muray and Richard Avedon in the process. It concludes with a look at modern nail trends and their exponents, whether trendy WAH Nails in London which promises to 'turn fashion trends into fingernail art' or the nail expos in Tokyo where people enter their own wacky designs into competitions. Spectacular: Modern nail art created by Naomi Yasuda (left) and by Tacarra Sutton (right) Stunning: Nail art and photography by Madeline Poole, Nailing Hollywood Productions for Steve Madden . But its not all crazy nail art. As Shapiro points out, each decade of the last century has had its own distinctive nail shapes and designs, with colours and looks sliding in and out of fashion. The . French manicure, for example, was very . fashionable in the 1920 and 1930s, while the arrival of the . 'power-dressing' look for women in the 1980s - think shoulder pads and . an epic blow-dry - heralded the arrival of strong, deep reds and purples. While modern manicures aren't quite the luxury item they once were, as Shapiro reveals, they're still one of the most creative parts of the beauty industry. Roll on the next 100 years!

The Large Hadron Collider will undergo an overhaul that will nearly double its power and allow scientists to uncover more secrets about the way our universe works. It opens up the possibility of solving . the riddle of Dark Matter, finding evidence of a far-reaching cosmic . concept known as 'supersymmetry', and even discovering signs of extra . hidden dimensions that help explain the mystery of gravity. By the end of the year the giant atom-smashing machine should be ready to boost its particle energy from eight trillion electrovolts, or teraelectronvolts (TeV) to 14 TeV - allowing it to perform the highest energy particle collisions ever attempted. Behind the veil: Upgrades to the Large Hadron Collider will hopefully allow scientists to make bold new steps in understanding the very ways in which our universe works . A new series of experiments due to resume early in 2015 could take scientists into an uncharted realm of physics known as 'beyond the Standard Model'. It is currently shut down as technicians and scientists work on its upgrade. Scientists may also uncover more Higgs bosons - different versions of the so-called 'God particle', predicted by Nobel laureate Professor Peter Higgs, that gives other particles mass. The Higgs boson was the last missing piece of the 'Standard Model', a blueprint of interacting forces and elementary particles that has stood in place since the early 1970s. Now scientists want to go further, beyond the Standard Model, to expand their theories about how the universe works. Dark Matter, the cosmic concept known as 'supersymmetry', and even hidden dimensions could be laid bare thanks to the revamp . Professor Tony Doyle, from the University of Glasgow, a leading member of the team operating the giant Atlas detector at the LHC, said: 'The idea now is that with the last missing piece of the Standard Model in place, the search now is for things that go beyond it, primarily suypersymmetry.' Supersymmetry proposes that for every matter particle there is a corresponding force- carrying particle as well. It requires not one but several Higgs bosons, providing new quarry for the LHC scientists to pursue. 'The universe being driven by supersymmetry is a really key idea,' said Prof Doyle. 'At the moment we separate things that are force carriers and matter particles. 'Evidence of supersymmetry would change our whole view of what's happening out there. Each of these particles would basically be the same thing, but one's force and one's matter. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a gigantic scientific instrument near Geneva, where it spans the border between Switzerland and France about 100 m underground. It is a particle accelerator used by physicists to study the smallest known particles – the fundamental building blocks of all things. It has revolutionised our understanding of the minuscule world deep within atoms to the vastness of the Universe. Two beams of subatomic particles called 'hadrons' – either protons or lead ions – will travel in opposite directions inside the circular accelerator, gaining energy with every lap. Physicists use the LHC to recreate the conditions just after the Big Bang, by colliding the two beams head-on at very high energy. Teams of physicists from around the world will analyse the particles created in the collisions using special detectors in a number of experiments dedicated to the LHC. 'Our world is made up of matter and forces and they are distinct, but at higher energy scales they would be interchangeable. That may have been how things were just after the Big Bang. The real question is, can we probe that?' Investigating supersymmetry may ultimately solve the riddle of Dark Matter - the invisible stuff that glues galaxies together with gravity but whose nature is unknown. Dark Matter could be composed of supersymmetry particles that 'just sit there, not doing anything', said Prof Doyle. Operating the LHC at higher energies may even offer scientists a glimmer of hidden extra dimensions, which in turn could answer unresolved questions about the nature of gravity. The upgrade will involve stripping the whole of Atlas , the largest of the LHC's six detectors, which is more than 150 feet long and 82 feet tall. 'Originally we thought we could get away with not having to disassemble the whole thing, but that proved impossible,' said Prof Doyle. 'This detector's been sitting around since 2008 and there's a lot that needs to be done. We're taking it all apart and putting it back together again. 'There's a lot of radiation damage, because the LHC was running at much higher intensities than it was originally designed for.' Other major work will be carried out on the 'ring', the 17-mile long circular tunnel through which protons, the 'hearts' of atoms, are accelerated to within a whisker of the speed of light. Welds and joints on the powerful magnets around the ring will have to be strengthened to take the higher currents. In 2020 a further upgrade will see the LHC's energy levels remain the same but its detectors made 10 times more sensitive. The machine is expected to remain in operation until 2030.

Jules Wakeham, 31, is to marry her partner Deane after having surgery to allow her to walk without a crutch or insoles . A bride-to-be will finally walk down the aisle after having surgery to treat her crippling arthritis. Jules Wakeham, 31, had a procedure to permanently fuse two of her joints and is now able to plan her wedding. She is one of the youngest people in the UK to go through the operation. Despite the operation, the severity of her condition means she will probably have to wear a pair of trainers underneath her bridal dress. Ms Wakeham suffers from osteoarthritis as a result of two seemingly minor accidents that caused major and unusual deformities. Before the operations on her wrist and ankle she could not walk without insoles in her shoes and the support of a crutch. Her heel was also always at least two inches off the ground. Ms Wakeham, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, said: ‘I haven’t come across anyone who has had as many joints fused as me at such a young age. ‘I haven’t been able to walk barefoot for five years now, and I’ve missed being able to walk down the street holding my fiancé’s hand. But I have learned to make the most of what I’ve got.’ In the last three years alone, she has had eight operations following two falls, which left her with numerous broken bones and deformities. Osteoarthritis is a condition that . affects the joints, causing pain and stiffness. It’s by far the most . common form of joint disease, affecting approximately eight million . people in the UK. Almost anyone can get osteoarthritis, . however, it is more likely if you are in your late 40s or older, are . overweight or if your joints have been damaged by injury. Ms Wakeham has severe osteoarthritis and before the operation to fuse her ankle joint (bottom) her heel was constantly at least two inches above the ground (top) Ms Wakeham, with fiance Deane, developed problems with her left leg after dislocating her knee in 2008 and started to suffer from arthritis in her wrist after breaking her arm soon afterwards . It occurs when the cartilage at the ends of bones wears away, leading to pain and stiffness. Treatment is limited to pain relief, exercise, weight loss, and ultimately joint replacement, but there is currently no effective drug treatment to prevent it developing or getting worse. Ms Wakeham, a textile technologist, said: ‘Osteoarthritis runs in my family, and it’s just something I’ve had to live with. ‘In 2008 I dislocated my left knee, . walking down some stairs in a textile mill. I knew what had happened and . my first instinct was to push it back in again, having been through . complications years before. Ms Wakeham is now looking forward to being able to walk down the aisle in September but suspects she will still have to wear trainers under her dress because of the severity of her arthritis . ‘Initially everything seemed fine, but my foot started to draw up from the floor in the subsequent few weeks despite physio. ‘I had four operations in three months, including having bone removed from my foot and a metal plate inserted to try and give me a chance of a flatter walking posture. I walked with a limp and on my tiptoe. ‘I was left with one leg longer than the other and over time it became apparent that my balance had deteriorated due to further foot deformity and I was certain I would need more radical surgery.’ Ms Wakeham broke her arm in a fall in Portugal (left) and had pins placed to support the bones (right). However, this failed to help them heal normally and they ended up deformed . Since surgery to fuse her wrist (left and centre) and her ankle (right) she is unable to bend or rotate her wrist but is able to use her hand normally again . Ms Wakeham returned to work months . later and spent a year trying to regain her strength and independence, . while walking with a crutch. However, . on a business trip to Portugal, she lost her footing once more and this . time, it was her arm that took the force of the fall. She . said: ‘I took a pretty heavy fall and I snapped both my radius and . ulna. Being in a foreign hospital, I followed their advice and allowed . them to put pins in my arm bones and send me home, without even . plastering my arm up. ‘After seeing the doctor in the UK it became apparent that the arm fractures were not healing and that my wrist had begun to heal in numerous displaced positions. Ms Wakeham said: 'I haven't been able to walk barefoot for five years now, and I've missed being able to walk down the street holding my fiancé's hand.  But I have learned to make the most of what I've got' ‘In January 2012, four months after . the accident, the arm breaks were plated, but the wrist remained in a . deformed, dropped position. ‘It seemed nothing other than fusing my wrist was going to help with regaining hand function.’ In February of this year, Ms Wakeham had her left wrist fused. The . long-awaited operation on her left foot and ankle followed in July. The . foot surgery had to take a back-seat whilst the arm and hand was . rectified. Osteoarthritis is a condition that affects the joints. It is the most common type of arthritis in the UK and about a million people see their GP about it every year. The main characteristics of arthritis are inflammation of the tissue in and around the joint, damage to the cartilage that lines the bones of the joint and bony growths that develop around the joint. These can lead to pain and stiffness. Osteoarthritis is most common in the knees, hips, spine and small joints of the hands. It is most common in people over the age of 50 and is more common in women than men. Younger people can also be affected, usually as a result of an injury or another joint condition. There is no cure but there are treatment options including physiotherapy, painkillers and hip or knee replacements. Source: NHS Choices . She said: . ‘It was the only option left for me. Although it was a bit daunting to . begin with, I’m making the most of what I’ve got. ‘My ankle and foot are completely . solid up to the base of my toes but I should eventually be able to walk . with a reasonable gait and posture, I already feel far better balanced. I . also can’t move or rotate my wrist, but at least I have much better . grip and hand function.’ The . surgery means Ms Wakeham can now marry her long-term partner, Deane . Pentney, also 31, who she has been planning to wed for seven years. ‘We’re hoping to get married next September,’ she said. ‘We haven’t been able to do it until now because there’s always been something going on with me medically. I still have two more minor plate removal operations to go, but I feel that I’m now in a place to truly look forward. ‘I am worried about what I’m going to wear but I’m planning on having a really long dress, so hopefully I can wear my trainers underneath.’ It’s not known how Ms Wakeham’s condition will develop in the future but she has found some closure in knowing that now two of her joints have been fused, they can’t deteriorate any further. She added: ‘The doctors haven’t been specific about my prognosis, but I feel like I’ve moved forward. Now I feel a sense of normality and balance again. ‘Opting to permanently lose the movement in your joints to ease your pain, imbalance and loss of control is a very big, final option. But I hope it will eventually give me the chance to get some independence back. ‘It’s going to take some time, but a good revelation from all this is that I am a fantastic healer – both physically and mentally it would seem.’ For more information about arthritis, visit the Arthritis Research UK website.","Jules Wakeham, 31, has severe osteoarthritis in her arm and leg .

When teenage mother Shannon Skinner fell pregnant for a second time, she agonised before deciding to have an abortion. But three months later, while still grieving for her unborn child, she was astonished to be told she was still pregnant. Now Miss Skinner, 19, says she is delighted to be five months pregnant and is looking forward to the birth of her second daughter in early May. Shannon Skinner, 19, had an abortion when she was eight weeks pregnant after she, and partner Anthony, decided it was too soon to have a second child - they also have a nine-month-old baby . She . went for a medical abortion at eight weeks because she thought it was . too soon to have a second child – she and her partner Anthony Hunt . already have Lacie, now nine months old. Miss Skinner, from Bristol, went to a Marie Stopes clinic for the procedure, which involves taking two separate doses of drugs. But unknown to her and the clinic, the procedure failed – a rare occurrence. Medical abortion is available to women within the first nine weeks of pregnancy. It involves taking two sets of pills over two visits to a clinic. The woman usually experiences discomfort and heavy bleeding after taking the pills. This normally lasts for a few days until the pregnancy has passed. The . abortion starts within four to five hours of taking the second set of . tablets and is usually completed within one to two days. Some . women are not able to have a medical abortion, including those who are . over 35 and smoke heavily, those who have a suspected ectopic pregnancy . and those with heart disease. Medical abortions fail to work in about two to three per cent of cases. A spokeswoman for the British Pregnancy Advisory Service told MailOnline: 'There is a small risk of your pregnancy continuing with early medical abortion. 'Good follow-up care is important, and any symptoms of ongoing pregnancy should be investigated. 'The . medication used has been associated with an increased risk of birth . defects but that does not mean women in this rare situation cannot go on . to have a healthy baby, and scans should provide reassurance.' Source: Marie Stopes . When . she continued to suffer morning sickness and said she could feel . movements in her womb, she was given a pregnancy test to do at home, . which was positive. But . when she returned to her doctor another test was negative and she was . told her symptoms were side effects as a result of the abortion. Miss Skinner continued to feel poorly and kept complaining – until tests finally revealed she was pregnant. She was told she must have become pregnant again after the abortion. But further tests showed her unborn daughter had survived the induced miscarriage. The couple said they had been using contraception when Miss Skinner fell pregnant. ‘We thought she had gone. I had grieved for that baby and we’d just managed to get our heads around it,’ Miss Skinner said. ‘Anthony and I felt like we’d made the right decision because we were . having problems and we didn’t think it was right to bring a baby into . that. ‘I’d always been one of those people that was against abortions and hated them, but I was suffering with postnatal depression. ‘Lacie . was just four months old at the time, so I had to do what I thought was . best. But it was not an easy decision and I regretted it straight . away.’ Miss Skinner and Mr . Hunt, a head chef at a restaurant, have been told that a medical . abortion fails to work in only around one case in 30. They . are still inside the legal 24-week limit for a surgical termination but . Miss Skinner said: ‘She’s obviously a little fighter, and we don’t want . to cause it any more harm. ‘When I had the abortion it didn’t feel the same as it does now – we have seen her and she has a heartbeat.’ Miss . Skinner had her latest scan last week. Midwives confirmed her unborn . daughter looks physically fine, however they could not rule out future . complications. A midwife at . St Michael’s Hospital, Bristol, where Miss Skinner is receiving . check-ups, is investigating what happened, and the couple have also . complained to Marie Stopes International. A spokesman for the family planning organisation said: ‘Very occasionally, the medical abortion pill can fail. 'Cases like this are few and far between but of course that does not make the situation any the  less upsetting.’ After the abortion, Ms Skinner continued to suffer morning sickness and to feel movements in her womb. She has just been told she is five months pregnant and that the abortion failed to work . Ms Skinner and Mr Hunt have now decided to keep the baby. It is not believed that she has suffered any ill effects as a result of the abortion drugs .

Celebrities might looks smug in suggestive photographs but they might not be enjoying themselves as much as they would have us believe. New research suggests that many racy photos and messages, known as sexts, are sent out of obligation to a partner, instead of for fun. Young people in committed relationships regularly send and receive unwanted sexts out of necessity and men are just as unenthusiastic about them as women, according to a study. University students in committed relationships regularly send and receive unwanted explicit messages and photos out of necessity and men are just as unenthusiastic about them as women, a new study suggests . U.S. scientists behind the study have dubbed the messages not sent for pleasure as ‘requisexts’. The research reveals that just as some . couples go along with sex to please their partner or avoid an argument, . the same is true of e-sex and sexts. Psychologists from Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne polled 155 undergraduates, who were in committed relationships, about their sexting habits and discovered that sexting is common among young adult undergraduates. A graph showing the frequency with which women and men engaged in unwanted but consensual sexting. The study found 55 per cent of female participants admitted to sexting when not in the mood, while 48 per cent of men said they had done the same as a way to please a partner . Their study, which will be published in the journal Computers in Human behaviour, found 55 per cent of female participants admitted to sexting when not in the mood, while 48 per cent of men said they had done the same as a way to please a partner. The numbers are similar to a previous report about ‘compliant sexual activity’ which revealed that 55 per cent of U.S. women and 35 per cent of men had had sex to keep their partner happy when they weren’t feeling like it, The Huffington Post reported. The psychologists believe gender role expectations could help to explain the behaviour, as men are more likely to engage in unwanted sexting because joining in is ‘relatively easy and does not require them to invest more into the relationship’. Women insecure in their long-term relationship who feared being dumped were more likely to be requisexters, perhaps in the hope the act make their partner seem less distant, the study said . They also think that women might be turned off by sexting as it does not help them reach relationship ‘goals’, but when polled, some of the survey’s participants said they simply did it because they were bored. People mostly participated in an exchange of X-rated pictures for ‘flirtation, foreplay, or to meet partner’s needs,’ as well as boosting intimacy, the study said. Women insecure in their long-term relationship who feared being dumped were more likely to be requisexters, perhaps in the hope the act make their partner seem less distant, the study said. The researchers wrote: ‘Consenting to avoid an argument was a mediator in the relationship between anxious attachment and consenting to unwanted sexting.’ The perfect recipe for love used to be eyes meeting across a crowded room followed by hours of scintillating conversation but now it seems that stimulating chats have been replaced by 140-character tweets. According to a recent study, Twitter is now the most common way of winning over a potential new partner and has even overtaken texting and phone calls. On average, it now takes 224 tweets, 163 text messages, 70 Facebook messages, 37 emails and 30 phone calls to seal the deal. The study, which was conducted by electronics retailer PIXmania, found that within the space of a single generation, the amount of time taken for love to blossom has more than halved. Couples aged 55 and over said on average their courting process took more than two and a half months (78 days) whereas for those under the age of 25 it takes just under one month (24 days) for them to refer to each other as boyfriend and girlfriend. As a result, researchers believe that this could signals the end of the traditional 'three day rule' where would-be lovers wait for 72 hours before calling a date back. Instead, it's now closer to three hours, with two thirds saying they were happy to contact their new beau within four hours of their first date.","U.S. psychologists found young people in committed relationships consent to unwanted sexting for flirtation, foreplay, or to meet partner’s needs .

British women are going nude and ditching their classic red lipsticks for softer, more muted shades. For the first time in three years nude lipsticks are outselling red on the High Street. Sales of sheer, natural shades are up 62 per cent at Debenhams compared to this time last year. Lipstick sales are often seen as a broad economic indicator with sales of bright red lippy said to rise in a recession and fall during an upturn. EstÃ©e Lauder chairman, Leonard Lauder, named it the 'lipstick index' theory in 2001, although the effect was first noted in the 1930s Depression. Julai Roberts and Oscar winner Cate Blanchett opted for nude lipstick at the ceremony last week . As economists insist we are now out of recession, recent lipstick sales figures back the theory, with a more modern look for lips the clear trend on red carpets and catwalks since the New Year. Actresses Cate Blanchett, Julia Roberts, Amy Adams and Kate Hudson all sported nude lips at the Oscars while singers Rita Ora, Pink and Alicia Keys did it first at the Grammys. In the past scarlet-lipped icons Marilyn Monroe, Ava Gardner and Elizabeth Taylor helped sales rocket and more recently Gwyneth Paltrow has spoken in favour of the, 'kick-ass' effect of a red lipstick. Current best sellers at the 200 year old British retailer include; Rouge Dior Nude Lipstick in 'Trench' by Christian Dior, Clinique's Long Last 'Twilight Nude' Lipstick and Urban Decays 'Naked' Ultra Nourishing Lip-gloss, which has been a best seller since its launch last month. 'The trend for sheer, nude lips and . more natural makeup was first highlighted on the Spring/Summer 2014 . catwalks and has been seen on countless celebrities ever since,' says . Sara Stern, Debenhams Health & Beauty Director. 'Even . Kim Kardashian has recently undergone a make-under, transitioning from . bright red lipstick and heavy application, towards a softer more relaxed . appearance I like to call naked make-up. This look creates an . illusion of being make-up free but with full coverage, perfect for . summer. Rock wife and Oscar nominee Amy Adams also chose neutral shades over bright red . 'There will always be a time and place . for the classic red lipstick, but on occasion it . can look a little outmoded. Today's trend-setters are definitely . embracing the less-is-more concept when it comes to cosmetics and for an . image that is bang up to date a nude lip is key.' The red lip does go back a long way though. Ancient Egyptians made lipstick by mixing together bromine mannite, iodine and fucus-algin - a plant dye. It made a nice red, but unfortunately was also poisonous. Urban Decay Naked Ultra Nourishing Lipgoss and Rouge Dior Nude Lipstick are top sellers . Elizabeth I used beeswax and plant extracts to create crimson lips, but in 1770 parliament made lipstick illegal ruling that women found guilty of 'seducing men into matrimony using cosmetic means' could be tried for witchcraft. Queen Victoria thought lipstick vulgar, but it was popularised by silent movie actresses in the early twentieth century. The first  modern swivel lipstick tube was patented in 1923 and companies such as Chanel, Helena Rubenstein, and Max Factor soon ensured almost every woman had one in their handbag. Now an estimated 81 per cent of women world wide wear lipstick.

An American biologist has spoken of his horror of finding a parasitic worm living in his mouth. Dr Jonathan Allen, 36, played host to a Gongylonema pulchruma parasite which spent three months moving around the fleshy part of his cheeks and lips. The parasite is usually only found in livestock and Dr Allen’s was just the 13th reported case in the U.S., and the 60th worldwide. Dr Jonathan Allen Allen saw a surgeon about the lump in his bottom lip (left) but was told it was 'normal' so he decided to take matters into his own hands and removed the parasite (right) himself using forceps . Dr Allen, an invertebrate specialist at the College of William and Mary, in Virginia, was teaching a class when he first noticed a raised lump in his mouth, HuffPost Live reported. ‘It was in the mucosa [the fleshy part of the cheek]. The first three months, it was in the back of the throat in places I could touch with my tongue,’ he told the website. ‘I could feel it with my tongue but not my finger. It wasn't until it moved to my lip that I could see it and was willing to talk to someone other than my wife and confess this was in my body.’ When Dr Allen noticed the parasite in his mouth he visited his dentist who referred him to a surgeon. However, when he saw the oral surgeon and explained that he had investigated his condition and believed himself to be the host of a parasite, the medic failed to believe him. Dr Allen said: ‘He said it was a normal discolouration in my mouth and he sees it all the time.’ After the encounter, Dr Allen decided to deal with the problem himself. Dr Allen, 36, played host to a Gongylonema pulchruma parasite which spent three months moving around the fleshy part of his cheeks and lips. He now keeps it in a jar . He used forceps to remove the parasite from his cheek with the help of his wife. He then discovered that his neighbour is an expert on the Gongylonema pulchruma so the pair set about studying it. Dr Allen now keeps the worm in a jar. He has written a paper in the Journal of Tropical Medicine about his experience as a host for the parasite. It is a worm that has no circulatory or respiratory system. It is usually found in animals - especially cattle, dogs, cats and rabbits - but can be transmitted to humans through unsanitary conditions and the ingestion of infected insects. It can also be picked up from foods that are contaminated during preparation in unsanitary conditions, or from contaminated water. The average length of a male worm is 29mm and the average length of a female is 59mm. The most common symptom in an infected human is the sensation of the worm moving around the mouth. Symptoms do not tend to develop until about six weeks after infection. The worm usually starts off in the oesophagus and then burrows its way into the mouth where it remains until it is removed. In most cases the parasite is removed, either by surgeons, or by the patient. If the worm is not extracted, symptoms can continue for up to a year.","Jonathan Allen played host to a Gongylonema pulchruma parasite .

Super-Earths, planets having a mass between that of the Earth and Neptune, are believed to be among the most common in our galaxy. Dr Jacob Bean, leader of the University of Chicago astronomers, said: 'I think it’s very exciting that we can use a telescope like Hubble that was never designed with this in mind, do these kinds of observations with such exquisite precision, and really nail down some property of a small planet orbiting a distant star.' The observations took around 96 hours . spread over 11 months - the longest period ever devoted to studying a . single exoplanet with the space telescope. Dr .

It is called a super-Earth because it has a mass between that of the Earth and Neptune, pictured. Exoplanet GJ 436b is shown here to demonstrate scale . Writing in Nature, the scientists described the findings as an important milestone on the way to identifying potentially habitable Earth-like planets among the stars. Follow-up observations suggested that the planet’s atmosphere was either mostly composed of water vapour or dominated by hydrogen with high-altitude clouds. The new study ruled out a cloud-free atmosphere of water, methane, nitrogen, carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide. A 'flat' signal from the Hubble data, lacking chemical fingerprints, indicated the presence of high altitude clouds of uncertain composition shielding what lay beneath. The U.S. space agency Nasa's 6.5 metre James Webb Space Telescope, due to be placed in orbit later this decade, is expected to reveal more information about exoplanet atmospheres. 'Looking forward, JWST will be transformative,' said graduate student Laura Keidberg, another member of the University of Chicago team. 'The new capabilities of this telescope will allow us to peer through the clouds on planets like GJ 1214b.

Superfit Sarah Davies is on a mission to break down the stereotype of a typical beauty queen - and she's using brute force to do it. The stunning 21 year-old has qualified for the Commonwealth Games as a weightlifter - while also competing in beauty pageants. Sarah, a full-time PE teacher, from Leeds says she . is passionate about changing the image of women by taking part in two . very contrasting roles. Beauty queen Sarah Davies is set to be a weightlifter at this summer's commonwealth games . She said: 'I hope that because I'm so far from the stereotypical beauty queen, young people will realise that the way to get the body you want isn't through starving yourself. 'I also like that one breaks the stereotype of the other, as people think female weightlifters should be really butch looking and beauty queens should be tall, blonde and rake thin. 'It shows you don't have to be manly . to enjoy the sport and you don't have to be skinny to be a beauty queen. They're both great fun and anyone can do it.

'It's very important in pageants now to have a healthy body and active . lifestyle and not to have a stick-thin, starved figure we used to see."" Sarah, . a former Miss Leeds, qualified for this summer's Commonwealth Games in . Glasgow after totalling 190kg with a 83kg snatch and 107kg clean and . jerk in the English Weightlifting Championships. Sarah Davies says she wants to challenge the perceptions of beauty queens .

She . is also set to take part in the Senior World Championships in November . in Kazakhstan - while having her sights on the Miss Galaxy England crown . on March 9. Commonwealth games hopeful Sarah Davies is more used to strutting her stuff in beauty pageants . Sarah, from Leeds, already holds the regional Miss Preston Galaxy title and winning the England crown would see her go to the final in America in August. Sarah trained as a gymnast from the age of five and got into weightlifting first, thanks to boyfriend Jack Oliver, who came 10th in the sport during the London Olympics. She said: 'It was September 2011 and Jack suggested I go to the gym and try some weightlifting for a bit of fun and that I may be quite good at it because of my gymnastics background. 'During my first ever training sessions I managed a scrappy looking 30kg snatch and an even worse looking 40kg clean and jerk. 'I'm quite a competitive person and I like being able to challenge and beat myself, therefore weightlifting was perfect for me and I fell in love with it straight away.' She might seem a big softie here but Sarah's set to become a weightlifting champ . Her first foray onto the catwalk came in March 2012 when she won Miss Leeds as a student in the city. At the moment she spends 20 hours a week training for weightlifting while also preparing for the required charity events in the Miss Galaxy England event. Sarah is currently working as a supply teacher at Temple Moor High School in Leeds, West Yorks. Sarah will be swapping floor length gowns for Lycra weightlifting gear . She added: 'It can be hectic trying to fit everything but I am lucky that the timing of the school day means I can fit everything in at the best time for me. 'Schools are usually supportive as they like to have an elite athlete as a teacher to be a role model to the pupils.' Sarah said her weightlifting helped her land the Miss Leeds title as she had something different to offer, and other girls in the competition come to her for advice on exercise. She said: 'Weightlifting has toned up my body and I'm in much better shape now I've been training. 'I think that's really helped with the beauty pageants I've been in, especially with the swim suit rounds. 'I absolutely love doing both and it's great that they work well together, even if it is an unusual mix.'

For three years he had suffered . from painful swelling in his left leg, which started at the top of his . thigh but spread right down to his ankle and then, in January this year, . to his groin and abdomen. Michael has lymphoedema, a chronic . disorder that occurs when the lymph system - a network of tiny vessels . that drains fluid, or lymph, from the tissue and back into the . bloodstream - doesn't function properly. This leads to a build-up of . fluid, causing swelling, pain, loss of mobility and increased risk of . infection. Then Michael learnt about an unlikely remedy - Kinesio . tape. This is the brightly coloured tape athletes, such as Real Madrid . footballer Gareth Bale, use to help prevent muscle injury, but it is . increasingly being used by specialists caring for people with . lymphoedema. After three weeks of treatment, Michael's swelling has been . dramatically reduced. Real Madrid footballer Gareth Bale (right), used Kinesio tape to help prevent muscle injury, but it is increasingly being used by specialists caring for people with lymphoedema, like Michael Gannons (left) Around 200,000 Britons are thought to suffer . from the condition. It occurs either as a result of an abnormality from . birth - 'primary' lymphoedema - or, more typically, when the lymph . system is damaged or blocked as a result of surgery, injury, obesity or . cancer treatment. In cancer patients it usually affects the arms and . legs, as the lymph nodes - small glands connected to the lymph vessels . that collect bacteria and other harmful substances in the lymph fluid - . are commonly removed to stop the disease spreading. Michael developed . lymphoedema in 2010 after surgery to remove a few cancerous lymph nodes . in his groin. Two years previously he'd had a malignant mole removed . from his left calf and it was thought that cancer cells had travelled up . his leg. 'After the operation the top of my left leg blew up like a . balloon,' says the 63-year-old biomedical scientist, who lives with his . wife Ruth, 66, in Luton, Bedfordshire. 'I found it hard to walk and . couldn't drive.' Every day for five months he had to go to hospital to have a litre of fluid drained from his leg.When . the swelling eventually subsided, Michael says: 'I jumped into my car . and drove to  Scotland to see a friend - I was finally free.' But a . few weeks later the lymphoedema returned, now affecting his whole leg. He was referred to a lymphoedema clinic at his local hospital, where he . was given compression stockings, bandages and manual lymphatic drainage - . massage to encourage lymph fluid to leave the swollen area.But he . found these had a limited effect and the compression garments and . bandages could be uncomfortable. Then, early last year, CT scans . revealed new tumours in his groin. After three weeks of treatment, Michael's swelling has been dramatically reduced . Because these were blocking lymph nodes, fluid gradually built up in his abdomen and scrotum and worsened in his upper leg. Finally, fed up with the wait at the clinic, in January he went private and was offered Kinesio taping.Kinesio . tape is essentially elastic cotton tape with a medical adhesive on the . back. For athletes, applying it over injured muscles is thought to stop . them overstretching and returns the muscle to a neutral position, . relaxing it and preventing further injury. With lymphoedema, applying it . to stretched skin 'lifts' the skin, reducing pressure on the lymphatic . system underneath - this  encourages lymph fluid to drain, explains Jane . Wigg, a lymphoedema specialist nurse based in Dudley. This is different . from compression garments, which encourage fluid into the lymphatic . system by applying compression (or pressure). A Chinese study, . published in 2009, showed that Kinesio taping worked as well in women . with breast cancer-related lymphoedema as bandages, and was easier to . use and more comfortable.'Kinesio taping is particularly helpful in . problem areas such as the top of the arm or leg, or the breast, where . compression garments don't cover or cannot be fitted easily,' says Jane . Wigg. 'Lots of my patients swear by Kinesio taping,' says Anne . Dancey, a consultant plastic surgeon  with a special interest in . lymphoedema at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, and BMI The Priory, both in . Birmingham. Michael underwent three weeks of intense treatment . where Kinesio tape was applied to his thigh, reaching up to above his . belly button and over his groin. It was removed and replaced every two . days - 'I barely felt it,' he says. At the end of the treatment his . leg was 8in smaller in circumference - 'it had contained a stone of . fluid and that's gone, so it looks the same as my other leg and there is . no fluid in my abdomen or scrotum,' says Michael. 'Now I can do all the things I couldn't before, such as driving, running and playing football - I can live a normal life.' He . still uses compression stockings to encourage fluid to move to working . lymph nodes, but these only reach his thigh, so he uses them in . conjunction with Kinesio taping in other areas. Thanks to the tape, he . no longer needs constrictive bandages.  But while Kay Eaton, a . consultant nurse in cancer and supportive care, who runs the lymphoedema . service at University College London Hospitals, agrees that Kinesio . taping may help, she says patients must be fully assessed before . treatment. For a lot of people Kinesio taping can help to control . lymphoedema but it isn't a standalone treatment, adds Karen Friett, . chief executive of the Lymphoedema Support Network charity. It must . be done by a skilled therapist, says Jane Wigg: 'They need to know where . the fluid is draining to and be able to follow the lymphatic pathways.' There . are also surgical treatments for lymphoedema. Liposuction can help by . removing the fatty deposits that build up with the fluid over time as a . result of accumulation of proteins and other changes to the tissue. This . fat can't be pushed away with massage or bandaging. The lymphoedema returned, now affecting his whole leg . However, while . liposuction can help if compression stockings are put on straight after . the fat is removed, it doesn't correct the problem in the lymph system. For . severe cases Anne Dancey offers lymph node transfer, where healthy . nodes are removed and transplanted to the problem area, though this is . not yet approved by the National Institute for Health and Care . Excellence (NICE). Ms Dancey's concern is the 'postcode lottery' across the UK for access to treatment: 'Many people are forced to spend . thousands to go private - some of my patients even go to France. Services are very overstretched. 'It's seen as only a complication of . surgery. And there's an attitude that cancer patients shouldn't moan . because their life has been saved by treatment that has given them . lymphoedema, when it's a completely debilitating condition. People get . infections constantly, can't work, can't wear clothes they want and it . affects self-esteem.' Lymphoedema is 'under-recognised and complex', . agrees Kay Eaton. 'If it's diagnosed early, treatment can be very . effective but this is often not the case.' Furthermore, the . Lymphoedema Support Network says those with non-cancer-related . lymphoedema - at least half of all patients - find it harder to get . treatment because the NICE guidelines only cover cancer patients, . particularly those with breast cancer (one in five develop lymphoedema). Michael . Gannons considers himself lucky to have been able to afford private . treatment. He is delighted with Kinesio taping and now plans to go on . holiday. He says: 'I'm going to enjoy wearing shorts this summer.' lymphoedema.org .","Michael Gannons, 63, from Luton, has lymphoedema and uses Kinesio tape .

A teenage boy bullied for having big ears at school is now turning heads as a female glamour model. Tiffany-Rose, who has been living as a woman since the age of 17, was born Niall Davies. As a teenage boy, she was subjected to cruel taunts by classmates who branded her 'ugly'. She made the life-changing decision to become female and her naturally feminine looks have now seen her land modelling work. Scroll down for video . Niall Davies aged 12 (L) who decided to live as a woman from the age of 17,  and Tiffany-Rose now 22 (R) Tiffany-Rose is set for a full sex change on the NHS and wants to pay for a breast augmentation herself to take her to a 34C. The 22-year-old, from Birmingham, says she has come a long way from the schoolboy bullied for having big ears and a big nose. Tiffany-Rose, who is currently on hormone treatment, said: 'Kids at school would tease me because my ears stuck out and I had a big nose. 'I would be called a ""freak"" and ""ugly"" and names like ""dumbo"". It was really upsetting. I didn't have many friends and felt isolated. 'Now I pass well as a woman - most people would have no idea I was born a man. I want to have a full sex change and boob job to make my transformation complete. Niall was a skinny boy who was bullied throughout school . 'I'd love to become a transgender underwear model to show those in my position that anything is possible,' she says. Tiffany-Rose has based her style on her heroes, who include Kim Kardashain, Cheryl Cole and Britney Spears. She said: 'I'm all about being individual but I get confidence from my favourite celebrities. 'I'm similar to Cheryl as we both just want to settle down and get married. 'I dyed my hair brown like Kim and Cheryl as I think it suits me compared to being bleach blonde, even though I did love being a blonde as it made me look like my idol Britney.' Unemployed Tiffany-Rose recalls how she first started to feel unhappy in her body aged eight. She: 'I loved watching my mum doing her hair and make-up. I didn't like anything boyish and I hated wearing boy's clothes. 'It was all very confusing, I was very young.' She claims she knew from the age of 13 that she wanted to become a girl and began experimenting with make-up. She said: 'I would go to school really early to avoid anyone in my family noticing I was wearing it. 'People would call me ""gay boy"", but I'd made a few girl mates by them so they stuck up for me.' A year later Tiffany-Rose decided to tell her mum about her feelings, which at first made her think she was homosexual. She said: 'My mum didn't seem surprised when I told her I was gay, but when she explained that being gay simply meant I would be attracted to other men I knew that wasn't the case. 'I felt like a woman and was attracted to straight men. She told me that she'd thought for years that I might be transgender - which meant that I wanted to be a woman. 'That's when I first started to understand my feelings.' At 16, Tiffany-Rose enrolled at a college to study hairdressing and began to accept her new identity. One year later she started calling herself Tiffany-Rose. She said: 'My mum was amazing, she knew I was probably transgender but wanted me come to my own conclusions. 'I haven't had contact with my biological father for five years but he knows I'm transgender and doesn't have a problem with it.' Tiffany models her look on celebrities such as Kim Kardashian and Cheryl Cole . Tiffany-Rose changed her name by deed poll in 2010 and began a course of hormones a year ago. She said: 'The hormones have given me confidence, my boobs are growing and myskin is a lot softer. 'It will take two years to feminise me but I will be on them for the rest of my life. 'Having boobs will allow me to fulfil my ambitions of being a transsexual glamour model. 'I want to inspire other transsexuals, showing them that being born in the wrong gender doesn't stop you from having a successful career.' Tiffany-Rose added: 'I hope to bring out my own make-up range and open a hairdressing salon, I'm really excited about the future.' Tiffany-Rose admires Britney Spears for her strength and often performs her routines on her YouTube channel .","Niall Davies started living as Tiffany-Rose at age 17 .

ROXY’S YOGA CONDITIONING . £2.99; www.imcvision.com . THE PROMISE: This is the second yoga DVD from Roxy Shahidi, who played Leyla Harding in Emmerdale. It . features three 45-minute yoga workouts — one focusing on the whole . body, the second aiming to strengthen the abdominal muscles, and the . third working the lower body. VERDICT: This is for intermediate level yogis. While Roxy mentions modifications for beginners, few are fully demonstrated. Many people think yoga is good for them so may launch into this thinking it perfectly safe. But . if anyone with knee, shoulder, wrist or lower back problems attempted . them a slightly wrong technique, it could exacerbate problems. Watch the DVD before attempting the workouts to get an idea of the moves as some are complex.

The ten to 15-minute sessions include four different exercises, such as dumbbell work. The idea is to complete between 10 and 40 repetitions of each exercise consecutively, with a 45-second break within each session. Poor technique: TOWIE's Amy Childs' DVD is pitched at beginners, but lacks instruction . VERDICT: This is pitched at beginner to intermediate level exercisers and you only need dumbbells and a mat. The basic concept is good, but it lacks concise instruction. For example, it doesn’t say how many complete workouts you should complete in 30 days - you’d probably have to do it at least three times a week to get results. Amy’s technique is often poor and isn’t corrected by Drew. Beginners are likely to follow suit. Advice on good technique seems to take a back seat and there is little encouragement offered. BEST FOR: Those who like following strict programmes and know what they’re doing. 1/10 . Top of the class: Our experts praised Davina's short, clearly presented workouts . DAVINA: FIT IN 15 £20.42; all major stockists . THE PROMISE: The fitness DVD queen Davina McCall has sold nearly two million DVDs in nine years.

There . are four 15-minute workouts — targeting strengthening and toning of . arms, legs and abdominal muscles — plus the ‘Cardio 15’ which includes . 30-second bursts of jumping, kicking and squats for ultra-fast . fat-burning. VERDICT: The instructions are clear and there are well-demonstrated options for advanced or easier versions. There’s also great advice on stretching and cooling down, which prevents blood pooling in the muscles. Start with sessions as stand-alone workouts, as fitness improves do three or four in one day, on non-consecutive days. BEST FOR: Anyone looking for all-round results . 10/10 .

This . 80-minute DVD contains four 20-minute workouts. The first three develop . speed, stamina and strength through interval training (repeated periods . of effort in longer bouts that you’d get with HIT). The . final workout is a fitness test involving you counting how many times . you can perform a particular exercise in 60 seconds. The advice is to do . one or more of the workouts three or four times a week in 21 days - . which could apparently lead to half a stone weight loss. Transformed: Big Brother star Josie Gibson has slimmed down to a size 10 after yo-yo dieting . VERDICT: The emphasis throughout, particularly in the final fitness test, is how many exercises you can perform in a set time. This is a great idea if you are experienced, but if not it is better to slow down and improve your technique. It’s . risky to do exercises fast and repetitively if you’re doing them wrong . as it could lead to repetitive strain injuries and mean you might not . use muscles effectively.

There are six ten-minute workouts that get progressively harder, presented by Vicky and trainer Robbie Thompson. The . idea is to do workout one (the easiest) daily for the first week, . workout two daily for the second week and so on until you have completed . all of them. Then you do two to four workouts every day. Trim: Geordie Shore’s Vicky Pattison has dropped from a size 16 to a six doing her workouts every day . VERDICT: The format of this is physiologically sound and the build up from easy to difficult workouts is a good touch. Progression is important in fitness as you can get injured or lose motivation by doing too much, too soon. Vicky demonstrates the hard version of each move and Robbie does the less demanding. No . equipment is required and all moves use your body weight for resistance . — so there’s numerous lunges, push ups and squats which are very . effective at strengthening and toning the entire body.

The third, Total Body Blitz, provides a . mix of fat blasting and toning in five ten-minute workouts which can be . done on a pick and mix basis. VERDICT: These DVDs are aimed at experienced exercisers. Caroline mentions easier versions of moves, but they are never shown. In . the Pilates section on the ‘Blitz’ DVD, there are not enough prompts . about positioning such as keeping your back straight and knees soft . which could lead to strained back muscles. Many exercises involve rotation which may cause muscles and ligaments being pulled or strained if done incorrectly. There’s . an assumption everyone can do planks —when you raise your body in a . straight line supported by forearms and feet — and press-ups, which is . untrue. If you are fairly fit, there is plenty of variety and doing a mix of sessions three to five times a week would improve fitness.

It recommends doing five of the 35-minute workouts a week with two rest days. Includes a workout calendar, 90-day fitness journal and nutritional guide. VERDICT: This DVD is a shambles — there are shaky camera angles, trainers rambling on when not knowing what to say, and some of the background trainers are out of sync, or do the exercises differently from the presenters and completely incorrectly. There is no explanation of technique before exercises, they jump straight in and just tell you to follow. As with any regular exercise you would see some improvements if you followed the workouts, but there’s too great a risk of people hurting themselves. BEST FOR: The occasional exerciser.0/10 . JODIE PRENGER FITNESS BLASTS £14.00; QVC . THE PROMISE: . Biggest Loser star Jodie Prenger’s DVD features six mini workouts of . high intensity that take ten minutes each, including a warm up and a .

There is a . good variety of six to eight exercises for each ‘blast’ and Jodie and . her friends ask for a full range of motion for each, which is good . advice. But using baked bean cans for weights would be ineffective and proper 3-5lbs dumbbells would be better. This will get results if done four to five times a week doing one mini workout a time, then building to two or three a day. 8/10 .","Veteran fitness queen Davina McCall wins praise for her clear instructions .

In June, David Cameron announced plans to order Google and other internet providers to ban child pornography from the internet. He said the Tia Sharp and April Jones murder cases, where their killers had viewed violent child pornography online, had swung public opinion in favour of stronger regulation. The 2013 survey, released today, found eight out of ten people in Britain say they rely on the internet for everyday activities. It is an increase from six out of ten people a decade ago.

The study of 2,000 people found more pensioners and disabled people are using the internet. For the first time the majority of middle aged people say they use social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook. Increasing numbers of people are also going online for basic everyday tasks such as shopping, banking or booking holidays.

Reality TV stars Lateysha Grace and Carley Belmonte have been competing against each other in a weight loss battle after being hurt by cruel comments about their figures on Twitter. The Valleys co-stars packed their bags and headed to boot camp where they both lost half a stone in time for the new season of their MTV show. A bit of friendly competition combined with the boot camp’s tough exercise regime and healthy diet plan proved to be the winning formula when it came to weight loss. Let the battle commence! The Valleys stars Lateysha Grace and Carley Belmonte have been competing against each other in a weight loss battle at boot camp . 20 year-old Lateysha slimmed down from 11st to 10st 7lb and lost 12 inches of fat as she toned all sections of her body and dropped a dress size. She . lost an inch under her arms and back, two inches off her waist, three . inches off each of her hips and three inches off her waist. Lateysha said: 'I am so happy with my body now. 'The kind of comments I was getting on Twitter were disgusting but I was determined to put everything right so I could once again feel confident about my appearance. Now I feel fantastic.' Biggest loser: Lateysha slimmed down from 11st (left) to 10st 7lb (right) and lost 12 inches of fat as she toned all sections of her body and dropped down a dress size . And her 22 year-old friend Carley wasn’t far behind when it came to shedding extra pounds gained while filming the hit MTV show, which returns in the New Year. Speaking about her 11.5in shrinkage, Carley said: 'It’s so hard to lose the weight and so easy to put it on. When we were filming I was drinking every night and was eating rubbish at all the wrong times. I needed to detox. 'The weight loss has been amazing. I’m feeling good and I’m determined to keep the weight off this time.' Lateysha put on a stone during the last series. She said: 'It is impossible to keep your weight under control on The Valleys. We are drinking all the time and living off takeaways. 'My weight fluctuates massively - on a bad week, I can put on 5lbs so I have to be very careful. 'The flipside is that I can also lose weight very easily.' She's back! Carley (left, before boot camp; right, after), who was paying a second visit to boot camp, lost 2 inches from her waist and hips and 3.5 inches from her bust . Lateysha said that being overweight shattered her self-esteem. 'I feel disgusting when I am overweight. You always get a lot of abuse on Twitter. I was continually dubbed ""fatty"". It can affect my self-esteem so much that I don't feel that I look good in anything.' Lateysha is hoping her days of yo-yo dieting are over after the trip to boot camp. 'It is the hardest thing I have ever done,' she explained. 'I almost threw up on the first day after they told us we'd have to go for a three-mile run.' Carley from Caerphilly, visited the same military diet camp in November and lost 10lbs after cruel fans branded her 'a whale’ on Twitter. But when her party lifestyle started up again she piled on a stone in five weeks seeing her weight jump to 11st 2lbs. Taunts: Both girls decided to visit boot camp after cruel Twitter taunts made them want to lose weight in time for the new season of their MTV show . Carley said: 'I’m working really hard to get back down to my ideal weight of 10st 2lbs but I don’t care what people say. 'Going back was tough. I knew what was in store. I was getting up at 6am every morning and it killed me. I was craving chocolate the whole time. 'It took so much out of me physically and emotionally but it was worth it. Now I know it’s a lifestyle overhaul, not just a quick fix.' This time Carley lost 2 inches from her waist and hips, 2.5 inches from her upper legs and 3.5 inches from her bust. She said: 'My bust shrunk again, my boobs have gone on tour!' But Carley admits attending the camp with her friend Lateysha helped keep her focused this time around. She said: 'It was Lateysha's first time and she cried after the fitness test! And seeing her get in an ice bath was hilarious - she wouldn’t stop screaming. But it made it easier with her there; a bit of friendly competition doesn’t hurt anyone.' Tough: They both found the week extremely hard and were put through gruelling military-style fitness tests . Now Carley is taking elements of the strict regime and incorporating them into her new and improved lifestyle. She said: 'I’ve been doing boxercise classes since I’ve got back and I’m eating healthily now – no more pizza! I really want to stay on track.' And Lateysha from Port Talbot, Neath feels the same way. She said: 'They have got me into all sorts of good habits. I have developed exercise regimes which work for me and I can see the benefits of a low-fat diet. 'I am drinking three or four litres of water a day - which really cleans out your system, does wonders for your skin and makes you feel so much better. As they were: Carley (L) and Letysha (R) pictured on holiday in the early days of the Valleys . Making a change: The girls are taking elements of the strict regime and incorporating them into their new and improved lifestyles . 'I have reached a weight that I am comfortable with and looks good on me. But I am never going to be mega skinny - there will always be a bit of bum and boob.' No 1 Boot Camp, where the girls stayed, sees a 40 per cent jump in orders at this time of year as women in particular plan drastic New Year diets. Lateysha is looking forward to starring in the new series of The Valleys which starts in February.

When actress Kim Novak, 81, attended the Oscars this year she hadn't been seen in public for a while and her looks provoked much conversation. Some were shocked by Novak's appearance and cruel comments were made. Novelist Laura Lippman felt bad about that. So much so, she decided to post a picture of herself, in her most natural state, with no make-up in 'solidarity' with the actress, using #itsokkimnovak. Novelist Laura Lippman tweeted this using #itsokkimnovak . The Guardian reported how the author, known for her Tess Monaghan series, then challenged others to tweet images of how they really looked and she was inundated! Kim Novak at the 2014 Oscars and inset in her hey day . Laura told MailOnline: 'I really felt bad for Kim Novak, especially after reading a piece about how Harry Cohn preyed on her insecurities. Then a friend pointed out to me that beauty and feminine beauty is such a big theme in my current book, After I'm Gone. 'As part of my research, I'd just spent three weeks talking about the options available to a beautiful woman of a certain generation, and how those options changed for her daughters.' It turned out Laura wasn't alone in how strongly she felt about women (and men) being judged on the way they look and the 'solidarity' images started pouring in from all over the world. Tweeter Sara J Henry sent this close up image of her face . Laura said: 'I think everyone, women and men, but especially women, become frustrated with the focus on appearance. And social media has provided a forum for ordinary people to be judged and ridiculed. So we now have more in common with celebrities in an odd way.' Erin Mitchell joined in the support with her no make-up selfie too . The 'raw' selfies have been cropping up all over the place, including on Facebook as well as Twitter and Laura thinks they now total around 1,500. 'Because not everyone tags (on Facebook) or uses the Twitter hashtag, it really is impossible to quantify but I had it very reliably, from someone who does marketing, that 1,500 people did it within 48 hours. After that, it's all anecdotal. One friend told me that she saw it being done by a group of Australian friends who didn't know the source. It just goes and goes.' she said. Christa Faust was moved to post a photo of herself, inspired by Laura Lippman's selfie . Perhaps part of Laura's reasons for feeling compelled to stand up for Kim Novak stem from some of her own experiences of being judged on her appearance, she she told MailOnline: . 'Six years ago, while on tour, I received an e-mail from a man who complained I didn't look like my author photo. ""Do you think that's fair?"" he said. 'I thought it was hilarious that someone would attend a book-signing because of the author's author photo. And just this past February, a man came up to me at the Key West Literary Festival and asked if I could sign a book for him. He said, ""I'll admit, I picked you because I liked your photo the best."" He was polite enough not to signal disappointment with the real-life experience.' This man wanted to join in on the 'strangely moving exercise' too . The novelist said she must have looked at 'hundreds' of photos over the past week, and 'with each one, the faces became more beautiful to me. My eye was changing. My aesthetics were changing. When you look at hundreds and hundreds of bare faces, without the benefit of Photoshop or professional lighting, bare faces start to look pretty good.' In a blog post headlined 'You So Pretty: Kim Novak, c'est moi' she wrote: . 'We need to stop lying about how people age. We need to own our Botox, our fillers, our nose jobs, our liposuction' Want to send us your natural selfies? Tweet your pictures to @Femail .

When Belfast bank manager Neil, 30, began losing his hair in his early twenties, he was both devastated and embarrassed. But his problems got worse when, after spending months saving up, he splashed out on a seven-hour hair transplant operation that left him with even fewer working follicles than before. Now he says the backfiring treatment has left him humiliated and self-conscious and says he has had to resort to using a dust-on dye to cover what's left of his locks. Disaster: Bank manager Neil has been forced to rely on a powder dye after his hair transplant went wrong . 'I feel that everyone's looking at me and that I look older than I am,' he explains. 'The powder works from a distance but if someone gets up close and personal, they can definitely see it and know something's not right.' His problems began when his hair started to thin in his early twenties, receding rapidly from his hairline and crown. But when his hair transplant failed to take, he was left with hair that was even thinner than before - and an unpleasant set of scars to boot. 'I thought the hair transplant was going to be worth it in the end but it didn't work out,' he adds. What lies beneath: With the dye powder washed away, the true state of his hair is revealed . Miserable: Neil says that because of his receding hairline and botched transplant, he won't go out without a hat . Getting better: Neil has since had another hair transplant and says his mane is getting thicker . The impact on his self-esteem was huge, with Neil admitting that for a while, it left him so low he was virtually unable to leave the house. 'I was wearing a hat and stayed in the house as much as possible because I didn't want people to question me about it,' he explains. Worse, he says that despite suffering from thinning hair for almost a decade and discovering the powder, spotting his balding pate in the mirror is still enough to leave him miserable. 'Every morning I get out of bed and see this [hair] and it just brings my confidence right down to rock bottom. Speaking on TLC documentary, Extreme Beauty Disasters, he added: 'I just need and want to have a full head of hair.' Happily for the 30-year-old, it seems a solution might soon be in sight as Neil, although initially reluctant, has since attempted a second hair transplant in a bid to repair the damage. Following the operation, he said: 'There's much more hair and I can see it . continually growing. The changes is phenomenal. 'I can see my hair . getting thicker day by day. In the past when I looked in the mirror, I . used to cringe whereas now I'm more happy with myself, more content. I'm . delighted - it has changed my life.'

Am I big enough (from him)? Small enough (from her)?...and the list goes on, in a repetitive loop. But by far the most asked question of all is 'Am I normal?' As a relationship expert, Tracey says that the question she gets asked most about sex is, 'Am I normal?' It’s the most commonly asked question in sex therapy and the hardest to answer because ‘normal’ is virtually impossible to define. We’re all individual! People ponder the question because they believe all the sex myths, know they don’t apply to their own sex lives, don’t realise they don’t apply to other people’s either and think everyone else is having a better time than they are. Tracey says in order to enjoy sex, we need to stop worrying about what everyone else is doing . But not only is it unhealthy and inhibiting to aspire to be normal (not to mention boring – do you really want to be the quintessential Mr and Mrs Jones?), it’s impossible. Read all the sex surveys you want but you still won’t really know what other people do in bed because what people say and what people do are two totally different things. Instead, steer toward another goal: developing a healthy, satisfying sex life where nothing is ‘kinky’ or wrong provided both of you agree. Don’t fall for the ‘but everyone else does it’ argument and be pressured into doing things you don’t want to, but do consider trying things that sound reasonable at least once. If you’re not sure if you’re being narrow-minded, look up a few good sex books to get an impression of whether what your partner is suggesting is standard sexual practice or listed with more unusual things (like sexual deviance). That will give you a good idea of whether your attitude to sex is prudish – or prudent. Otherwise, relax and enjoy and stop worrying about anyone other than yourselves.

Laura Ferguson, 26, had struggled with an eating disorder since the sudden death of her mother on Christmas Day in 2008, but her relatives believed she had 'got over' the illness. However, in September last year she was found dead at her home in Burnley by her father Joe. Tragic: Laura Ferguson died of a heart condition related to her ongoing struggle with anorexia . Passion: Miss Ferguson was a champion showjumper who had represented England in international contests . Family: The 26-year-old struggled to cope with the death of her mother Anne, right, on Christmas Day in 2008 . Miss Ferguson worked as a carer and had represented England at pony-jumping, winning a gold medal in an international competition, Burnley Coroner's Court heard yesterday. Her father told the inquest that she had struggled to cope with her mother's death from a heart attack, and subsequently developed anorexia. 'Laura was very close to her mother and was very significantly affected by that,' Mr Ferguson said. 'For the next few months she wasn't eating properly. She tried to disguise it with baggy clothes.' Discovery: Miss Ferguson's father Joe found her dead in her bedroom on September 23 last year . Loss: Miss Ferguson was thought to be recovering from her eating disorder at the time of her death . Miss Ferguson consulted her GP about her eating disorder, and was referred to two clinics including the Priory Centre in Bury. 'She spent some time there but when she came out her appetite had returned,' her father said. 'She had responded to treatment. 'She seemed absolutely fine and was quite happy with herself. She had everything to look forward to. 'We had booked a holiday to Egypt in September. She had been out buying new clothes - she was excited.' Mr Ferguson said that his daughter, whom he described as 'fit and active', complained of a headache when she returned from work on September 22. Devastated: Mr Ferguson thought that his daughter was sleeping but discovered she was 'unresponsive' Harrowing: Miss Ferguson had posted a series of photos of her emaciated leg on Facebook . He thought she was asleep when he checked her bedroom at 8am the next day, but when he looked again at midday she was 'unresponsive'. Pathologist Abdul Al-Dawoud, who carried out a port-mortem examination, said the 'most likely' cause of death was an inflammation of the heart called myocarditis, commonly brought on by viral infections. He said: 'There is nothing to suggest that this is anything other than a natural cause of death. This medical cause of death is not uncommon.' Coroner Richard Taylor concluded that Miss Ferguson died of natural causes, saying: 'There was a problem with her heart. From what the doctor has told me, it cannot be anything else.'

A mother-of-four says she is desperate to get two stone of excess skin removed after she lost more than half of her body weight. Kerry Trotter lost 16st after being given a gastric bypass in September 2011. The 39-year-old dropped from 27st to 11st in three years after realising she was going to die if she kept putting on weight. Kerry Trotter lost 16st after being given a gastric bypass in September 2011 but has been left with two stone of excess skin that she is desperate to get rid of . But following her drastic weight loss, Mrs Trotter says she cannot get funding to have the excess skin removed. Mrs Trotter, who is mother to Hayley, 21, Brad, 19, Caitlin, 14, and Holly, 11, now fears she will be stuck with the skin forever. The mother, from Penshaw, County Durham, believes the lack of funding is due to a postcode lottery. She said: 'You should be examined as a person not by the area you live in. 'If the funding for it isn’t available here then they should go to someone else. Before and after: The 39-year-old dropped from 27st to 11st in three years after realising she was going to die if she kept gaining weight . 'Some places seem to get funding to remove access skin no bother whereas others have to fight for it. 'I really hope I get it as I cannot afford to pay for it myself. Even though I have lost the weight the excess skin still means I have to buy stretchy clothes and a size bigger to hide the lumps and bumps.' Mrs Trotter put on weight after becoming pregnant with her first daughter, Hayley, and moving in with her husband Lee, 42. She said: 'I put on weight really quickly as I was buying my own food and eating what I wanted. 'My mum was always losing weight and . putting it back on again and I knew I didn’t want to be like that. I . didn’t care about my weight as long as I was happy.' Mrs Trotter would regularly eat takeaways for dinner or go for a bar meal as it was easier than cooking a meal at home. Mrs Trotter now fears she will be stuck with the skin forever. The mother-of-four believes the lack of funding is due to a postcode lottery . She would snack on multipack bags of crisps as well as chocolate and fried food. But it wasn’t until she struggled to fit into a size 32 pair of jeans, the biggest she could buy in the shops, that she decided she needed help with her weight. She said: 'I didn’t realise how big I was. I bought a paid of size 32 jeans and I could barely fasten them up. Mrs Trotter says she cannot afford to pay privately to have her excess skin removed . 'By the time I got to the pub I had to undo the button. 'Luckily I was wearing a long t-shirt to cover up. I was wearing the same clothes all the time as I couldn’t find anything to fit. 'It got to the point when I realised if I don’t do something I am going to die. I couldn’t walk up the stairs without puffing and panting and could not even walk to the shop at the end of the street, I had to drive. 'I would purposefully wait until the 9am bus and take my children to school late as I could not walk up the bank to school. 'None of my children could put their arms around me I was so big.' In 2009 Mrs Trotter visited her GP and was put on slimming pills and appetite suppressants to help her lose weight. However when they failed to help, her GP suggested a gastric bypass. However, Mrs Trotter had to lose weight naturally beforehand to prove she was dedicated.

A great-grandmother can see her husband clearly for the first time in 15 years after she had a tiny telescope fitted in her eye - and says he's as lovely as he's ever been. Margaret Ward, 90, lost her sight in 1999 after the gradual onset of late-stage macular degeneration. It left her with no central vision in her left eye and only partial sight in the corner of her right eye. Margaret Ward, 90, can see her husband, Charles, 95, clearly for the first time in 15 years after she had a tiny telescope fitted into her eye during a pioneering procedure. She said: 'I can see he hasn't changed at all in the past 15 years. He doesn't have any wrinkles and he's lovely' As a result, she was unable to cook or read or recognise her husband Charles' face. But she has become one of just seven people in the country to undergo pioneering surgery and have a pea-sized telescope - an Implantable Miniature Telescope, from CentraSight - implanted in her right eye. She said: 'I am still in love with my husband Charles and it has been awful not seeing him properly for the past 15 years. 'I can see he hasn't changed at all in the past 15 years. He doesn't have any wrinkles and he's lovely. 'I am not one just to go on looks alone, so it's not just that he's gorgeous, he's just a wonderful person.' The surgery Mrs Ward had involves removing the eye's natural lens and replacing it with a tiny telescopic lens - this is done under local anaesthetic. Image shows how the telescopic lens magnifies the images that are projected onto the retina. It projects images onto the healthy part of the retina which is not degenerated by the disease . Mrs Ward had her right lens removed and replaced with a pea-sized telescopic one (pictured). This magnifies everything three times and is enabling her to recognise faces again for the first time in 15 years . This lens magnifies objects by three times and also projects images onto a healthy part of the retina instead of the areas damaged by the disease. The patient then use the eye with the telescope for detailed central vision and the other eye for peripheral vision. Mrs Ward, who has eight great-grandchildren, said: 'I can now see my great-grandchildren's faces properly and that is really exciting.' The Implantable Miniature Telescope, from CentraSight, is implanted in place of the eye's lens - this has to be removed first. The operation takes place under local anaesthetic while the patient is awake. The new telescopic lens magnifies everything by three times. The eye with the implanted telescope is then used for central vision while the other eye is used for peripheral vision. Before the full benefits are reaped, the patient's brain has to get used to blending the magnified image with the image from the other eye. The telescope is ideal for macular degeneration patients as the condition causes them to lose their central vision, but not their peripheral vision. She added: 'Charles and I can watch . sports on television – snooker and darts – without me having to . constantly ask him who is playing. 'I can make out the difference and see who is taking the shot. We're sports mad, Charles and I, so this is really important to us.' Mrs Ward, of Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, underwent the surgery at the Spire Dunedin Hospital in Reading in August. She says she only found out about it because she heard a news story about the procedure. She said: 'I was getting desperate, I was struggling to cope and felt really in the doldrums. 'The first thing we knew about the CentraSight IMT telescope was one morning when we were having our early morning tea in bed with the television news on – I don't take much notice about it and heard something about macular degeneration and something about a telescope. 'I asked one of our granddaughters, Heather, who is an optometrist, to look into it. Mrs Ward's granddaughter discovered that the new procedure had just started to be offered in the UK so the great-grandmother contacted a doctor to discover if she would be eligible. She added: 'Before the surgery I struggled to see people properly, even people that I knew well. 'I never knew who was speaking and I would have to say who are you - which was awful when it was someone I knew well. This has given me my social life back.' Mrs Ward is only the seventh person in the UK to have the lens fitted. Image shows a cross section of the lens in place in the eye . Mrs Ward said: 'I am still in love with my husband and it has been awful not seeing him properly for the past 15 years' Mr and Mrs Ward met while they were both stationed in North Africa during the Second World War and they married in 1946. They celebrated their 68th wedding anniversary last weekend. Macular degeneration is a painless eye condition that generally leads to gradual loss of central vision, but can sometimes cause a rapid reduction in vision. It causes the central vision to become increasingly blurred and causes difficulty reading and recognising faces. Mrs Ward had the procedure under local anaesthetic and says it is wonderful to be able to see her great-grandchildren properly. All of them were born after she lost her sight so she has never seen them clearly . It usually affects both eyes but the speed at which it progresses can vary from eye to eye. It does not affect the peripheral vision so it will not cause complete blindness. It occurs when the macular - the part of the eye responsible for central vision - becomes less effective and it is most common in older people. Oscar-winning actress Dame Judi Dench, aged, 79, is among those who suffer from it and she has said it has left her unable to read scripts and struggling to watch films.

A mother has accused a private girls' school of 'barring' her daughter while she was recovering from anorexia because they feared she might inspire 'copycat' cases. Lottie Twiselton, 16, has spent the last two years battling with the severe eating disorder - enduring a year in and out of hospital as her weight plummeted to just six stone. But when it came to rejoining her classmates at the fee-paying Northamption High School to finish her GCSE studies, she was told her inclusion 'would be too disruptive', according to her mother. Accusation: Claire Twiselton and her daughter Lottie have accused Northampton High School of 'abandoning' the 16-year-old because of her eating disorder . Support: Claire and Lottie Twiselton said they were devastated when they were told the 16-year-old could not rejoin her friends at Northampton High School . 'Without a doubt one of the main . reasons Lottie was not allowed back to school was because she was . someone who lots of people looked up to. In the head teacher's eyes, she . may well have inspired copycat disorders,' Claire Twiselton told the Times. Lottie left the school to get intensive treatment for her disorder from a specialist London clinic after developing the potentially lethal disorder aged 14. After being discharged from hospital last year, she had hoped to go back to school on a part-time basis until she fully . regained her strength. But . her hopes of fitting back into school life were dealt a blow when the . school said it did not want her to return until she was well enough to . come back on a full-time basis. Care: Lottie Twiselton, pictured, left Northampton High School to get treatment for anorexia . Barred: Lottie Twiselton nearly died from anorexia which she developed when she was 14 but was asked not to return to her old school until she had fully recovered . Lottie, who is now a pupil at Quinton House School, in Upton, said the rejection was devastating. Describing . the upset at not being able to immediately rejoin her friends, she told . the Northampton Chronle: 'I was very upset about it. I almost died and . without the support of my friends I would not have pulled through. Alumna: Dame Eliza Manningham-Buller, former Director General of MI5, is a former pupil of Northampton High School . 'I . was completely ready to go back and be with them and just get back to . normal but I was told the school weren’t able to have me back. It would . have given me such a boost to my progress.' Lottie's father, Robert, 46, who divorced from her mother several years ago, has also attacked the school - whose past . pupils include Baroness Marcia Matilda Falkender, former private . secretary to Harold Wilson, and Baroness Manningham-Buller, former . director general of MI5 - over its treatment of his daughter. He said: 'The school's response to Lottie coming back was pretty poor. People . suffering from anorexia are encouraged to work towards a particular . goal and Lottie was working towards getting back into school and to be . with her friends. 'This was . all taken away from her when the head teacher made it clear she was not . welcome back. Lottie has shown remarkable courage and determination to . get this point. 'Anorexia, particularly amongst teenage girls is not as uncommon as people think and schools need to be aware of that.' Mr Twiselton told how he feared the eating disorder would kill his daughter at one stage. Upset: Lottie Twiselton says she was distraught at not being able to rejoin her classmates . Exclusion: Lottie Twiselton said she was devastated when she was told she could not rejoin her classmates . 'At its worst, we thought this might be it for Lottie. She needed to be forcibly fed through a tube and she went from a happy, healthy teenager to nothing at all. 'Claire and I divorced a few years ago and we have considered whether this had an impact on Lottie.'She . became obsessed with her weight and appearance. She would look at . pictures of celebrities in magazines and on the internet and was . convinced she was fat and ugly.' The school has rejected the criticism . leveled at it by Ms Twiselton and disputed the version of events given by the pupil's mother. Critical: Mother Claire Twiselton has criticised Northampton High School, pictured, for not allowing her daughter Lottie to return on a part-time basis . Rebuttal: Northampton High School, left, and headmistress Sarah Dixon, right, have refuted the Twiselton family's version of events and said pupil health and wellbeing was 'at the heart of everything we do' A . statement issued by the school said: 'The . school responded to say that they were very keen to support Lottie’s . integration but remained of the view that it would be preferable to wait . until Lottie was well enough to return on a full-time basis. 'The health and wellbeing of our pupils is at the heart of everything we do... The professional view of the head and her team was that an interrupted part-time programme in a crucial year would not be in the interests of Lottie’s welfare or education. 'To say that Lottie was excluded is simply not true as is the assertion we were concerned about copycat issues. 'In school our approach is very pro-active and open in talking about and raising awareness of such issues through a variety of means including PSHCE lessons, tutorial support, extra-curricular sessions where guest speakers address the girls and parent talks/workshops, as well as having a full time nurse and the services of a school counsellor.'","Lottie Twiselton, 16, weighed SIX stone when hospitalised with anorexia .

After days and repeated refusals from city officials, Jose Reyes has officially been identified as the Sparks Middle School shooter. The seventh grader who was 12-years-old, allegedly opened fire with a 9-millimeter Ruger semiautomatic pistol and shot three people in Nevada on Monday and one of the victims, Michael Landsberry died. Reyes also died in the shooting spree after turning his gun on himself and authorities in the city had claimed their much-questioned desision to not release the name was to protect his family's privacy. Scroll down for video . Grief: Jannelle Tan grieves for her teacher Michael Landsberry during a vigil held at Sparks Middle School on Wednesday, Oct. 23, 2013 in Sparks, Nevada.  Monday's shooting left Michael Landsberry dead and two students injured . Sparks City Attorney Chet Adams released the boy’s name Thursday after the Reno Gazette-Journal announced its plans to file a lawsuit. Multiple students at the school had already told the the Reno Review-Journal on Monday and Tuesday that Reyes was the shooter, but the newspaper refused to report the name lacking official confirmation. However, authorities were fighting a losing battle as the young shooters identity was already widely known amongst Sparks' 90,000 residents and was being circulated widely on social media. 'It's obvious that the name's out there,' Sparks Mayor Geno Martini acknowledged before the name was released. 'But our obligation legally is not to release the name because there's an ongoing investigation.' City officials later acknowledged a report from the Univision affiliate . in Reno that disclosed the name and said they would release it publicly . to be fair to families and other media outlets. In a news release, Sparks spokesman Adam Mayberry said the name of the seventh-grader was released in 'order to be fair to all the families involved and all the news media.' Hero: Michael Landsberry, 45, pictured with his wife Sharon, was shot dead by a teenage boy at the school where he taught in Sparks, Nevada on Monday . Landsberry is believed to have been a married father who had just celebrated his wedding anniversary this weekend . But he said Adams’s acknowledgement of a Univision Spanish language news story on the shooting earlier Thursday was 'misinterpreted' by reporters. Adams was not identifying Reyes as the suspected shooter, according to Mayberry. But once that story was out and picked up by other media, the decision was made to identify the shooter. On Wednesday, Adams had cited state laws that he said prevented him from releasing the shooter’s identity because the investigation was continuing and because the suspect was a juvenile. But Barry Smith, the executive director of the Nevada Press Association, maintained releasing Reyes’ identity would not have any effect on an investigation. A tearful Michelle Hernandez, left, is led away from Agnes Risley Elementary School following a shooting at Sparks Middle School on Monday morning . Law enforcement personnel gather at the scene of a shooting at Sparks Middle School. The scene was cleared by SWAT teams and a bomb disposal unit . He said all media sought was the name of a dead person, and there is no law preventing the release of the name of someone who dies. Then on Thursday, the Gazette-Journal announced it would file a lawsuit against Sparks if the shooter’s identity was not released. A few hours later, the name came out. School Superintendent Pedro Martinez said in an extensive mass email to all district parents that school officials are reaching out to provide counseling and other services. Parents were encouraged to do the same. 'It is difficult to imagine something of this nature happening in our own community and impacting us so closely,” Martinez said. 'We know we will be feeling many emotions as we struggle to understand and cope with this incident,' he wrote. Sparks students struggled to cope with the violence that interrupted their Monday morning classes . Police have cleared out the school and searched the building room-to-room. They say Sparks Middle School is safe and they were convinced there was only one shooter . Landsberry, 45, was an ex-Marine who coached basketball and soccer and was known as a big fan of Batman. In his email, Martinez outlined a variety of resources available to families, including a crisis call center and the Northern Nevada Mental Health Services. It was sent Wednesday night while hundreds of students and others gathered at a candlelight vigil outside the school, where community leaders and clergy offered prayers and words of encouragement. Spanish Springs Presbyterian Church Pastor Howard Dotson led students in a pledge to 'be a peacemaker.' Students fled Sparks Middle School after a shooting before class Monday left two dead and two critically wounded . 'There is nothing glorious or sexy about guns,' they repeated after him. 'I want to learn and grow old and have many children.' Meanwhile, the mother of one of the wounded boys told reporters she’s committed to helping promote gun safety in the community, and her son said he used to think of guns as a toy, but not anymore. Jenifer Davis said it’s a 'miracle' that her 12-year-old son, Mason Kamerer, survived the shooting. 'As a result of this incident, I will be getting involved with issues around gun safety in the hopes of preventing this kind of situation in the future,' said Davis, who said she has owned guns and always kept them locked but will be even more proactive in the future. Kamerer told CNN he heard what sounded like distant gunfire then spotted Landsberry lying motionless on the ground before he found himself within 10 to 20 feet of the shooter, who said nothing before firing a single shot.","Reyes has been described by students as having friends but shy .

Facebook today bowed to pressure from David Cameron and child internet protection campaigners by taking down a graphic video of a woman being beheaded in Mexico. The Prime Minister had accused Facebook of irresponsibility after it lifted a ban on users posting videos of beheadings - and demanded the social networking site explain its decision to parents. Critics accused the firm of ‘taking leave of its senses’. Facebook had said that while the images must not be posted for ‘sadistic pleasure’ they should be available for those who wish to condemn them. Terrible: The filmed executions of people like Ken Bigley, left, will be . allowed to be shown on Facebook after they quietly lifted a ban, which David Cameron, pictured today, called 'irresponsible' Alert: Facebook has begun adding warning messages to videos on its website showing decapitations . However, last night it was revealed . Facebook had removed the clip of a woman being beheaded and said it . would use a broader set of criteria to determine when gory videos are . permitted on the site. The website had earlier begun adding alerts to videos showing decapitations or other extreme violence, saying: 'Warning! This video contains extremely graphic content and may be upsetting'. ‘When . we review content that is reported to us, we will take a more holistic . look at the context surrounding a violent image or video,’ a Facebook . spokesman said. Critical: Hostage UK, a charity supported by Ken Bigley's brother Phil, pictured, has accused Facebook of 'playing into the hands of hostage-takers' ‘Second, we . will consider whether the person posting the content is sharing it . responsibly, such as accompanying the video or image with a warning and . sharing it with an age-appropriate audience.’ The . change underscores a challenge for Facebook as it seeks to position . itself as the go-to online destination where people share . up-to-the-minute images and discuss breaking news events. The . US firm acknowledged last night that its previous approach, which . permitted the video of the woman's killing in Mexico to remain on its . site, was flawed. ‘Based on . these enhanced standards, we have re-examined recent reports of graphic . content and have concluded that this content improperly and . irresponsibly glorifies violence. For this reason, we have removed it,’ the company said. Suicide . prevention charities had denounced the original move to lift the ban on . beheading videos, warning that the clips were ‘psychologically . destructive’ to teenagers. Others . accused Facebook of double standards for allowing footage of beheadings . but restricting what breastfeeding mothers can post and demanding women . remove pictures of their mastectomy scars. Criticism: David Cameron used rival site Twitter to hit out Facebook's new policy . Gruesome videos of people being beheaded are to be allowed on Facebook once again. The social network claims that its users should be able to watch and condemn these videos, but not celebrate them . Facebook’s . unpublicised change in policy came to light after it refused to remove a . 57-second video showing a young Mexican woman, her hands tied behind . her back and on her knees, being beheaded by a masked man in broad . daylight. It was posted last week under the title ‘Challenge: Anybody . can watch this video?’. One disgusted viewer commented: ‘Remove this video, too many young innocent minds out there shouldn’t see this.’ Another . wrote: ‘This is absolutely horrible, distasteful and needs to be . removed... I’m very disturbed after seeing a couple of seconds of it.’ Mr . Cameron wrote on Twitter: ‘It’s irresponsible of Facebook to post . beheading videos, especially without a warning. They must explain their . actions to worried parents.’ Last . night one of Facebook’s advertisers, car-sharing companty ZipCar, . withdrew its adverts in protest, saying: ‘We do not condone this type of . abhorrent content being circulated on Facebook.’ Dr . Arthur Cassidy, of suicide prevention group the Yellow Ribbon Program, . said: ‘It only takes seconds of exposure to such graphic material to . leave a permanent trace – particularly in a young person’s mind.’ The site, which is open to anyone over the age of 13, had banned footage of decapitation on its site in May citing concerns that it would cause long-term psychological damage . Stephen . Balkam of the Family Online Safety Institute – a member of the Facebook . safety advisory board – urged the site to reverse the policy and Will . Gardner, of Childnet International, which also sits on the advisory . board, said ‘Such content should be taken down. There . is a need to raise issues happening around the world... but some . content is horrific. We would want to see steps to try and protect . people from coming across such content.’ Hostage . UK, supported by the family of British engineer Ken Bigley – who was . kidnapped and beheaded in Iraq in 2004 – accused Facebook of ‘playing . into the hands of hostage-takers’. Trustee Sue Williams said: ‘It will . cause great pain to the families who have lost loved ones who were . hostages.’ John Carr, of . the UK Council For Child Internet Safety, said: ‘Facebook has taken . leave of its senses. Those videos will fuel countless nightmares among . the young.’ But Sean . Gallagher of Index On Censorship warned about the impact on freedom of . expression:  ‘Films about beheadings may be deeply upsetting and . offensive but they do expose the reality of violent acts that are taking . place.’ Facebook had . introduced a temporary ban on decapitation videos in May but later . removed it, explaining that the site is used to share information about . world events, such as acts of terrorism and human rights abuses. Facebook may now allow videos of people being beheaded, but there are a number of subjects and clips it will not allow to be published on in its site. Facebook has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content and any explicitly sexual content where a child is involved. Elsewhere, the site imposes ‘limitations on the display of nudity’ but doesn’t ban it outright - it depends on the context and circumstance. Female nipples, as a rule, will be removed but male nipples are allowed. A photo was famously removed last year when an elbow was mistaken for a female nipple, before being reinstated. Breastfeeding images were removed in 2012, but Facebook’s Community Guidelines now states the site ‘respects people’s right to share content of personal importance’ and makes explicit reference to breastfeeding. The pictures are allowed if the child is seen ‘actively nursing’ but may be removed if it shows the nipple. Children playing in the bath are accepted as long as they are not graphic and explicit, while sculpture and art work that depicts the naked body is allowed, but real-life images and similar poses are not. Another photo famously taken down showed Kylie Minogue holding a teddy bear with her microphone positioned in such a way, between the bear’s legs, that made it look phallic. Facebook removed it for violating the use of ‘photos that contain nudity, drug use or violence.’ Any video that condones violence, threatens or is abusive and bullying towards another person or promotes criminal activity is prohibited. Any promotion or encouragement of self-mutilation, eating disorders of drug abuse is similarly banned. Facebook does not permit hate speech, especially towards individuals, groups, sex, race, ethnicity, disability or sexual orientation – yet will distinguish between ‘serious and humorous speech’ and will allow videos and posts that ‘challenge ideas, institutions and certain practices.’ Sharing graphic content for 'sadistic pleasure' is prohibited, yet if the content is shared in the process of reporting current events it is be allowed as long as it balances ‘the needs of a diverse community.’ Facebook monitors photos, but also relies on its users to report content they feel should be removed. If a photo is under investigation it may be temporarily removed while Facebook looks into the complaint but will be reinstated if it is found not to have breached the code.","Facebook banned decapitation videos in May due to psychological damage .

Justin Chey, from Des Moines, Iowa, manages to work small jobs between attending school, cooking meals, preparing insulin injections for his diabetic grandfather and looking after his grandmother, who has Alzheimer's - all while his mother, who is originally from Cambodia, works night shifts as a school custodian. But on October 10, after suffering severe headaches, Justin collapsed in class at Hiatt Middle School and tests revealed he has a cancerous tumor, a medulloblastoma, inside his brain. After the tumor began affecting his . facial muscles and vision, he underwent emergency surgery. He will begin . chemotherapy in two weeks but doctors said they do not yet know his . prognosis. They have yet to determine whether the tumor, which is situated in the lower part of his brain, has spread to his spine, the Des Moines Register reported. Throughout the past few months, Justin never let on the extent of his painful headaches and insisted he needed to go to school. Devoted: His mother, Kelly Chey, who is originally from Cambodia, works the night shift as a custodian and Justin has taken on cooking and caring for his grandparents, while also picking up odd jobs . Proud: Kelly, who moved to the U.S. in the 1980s, said she is proud of her son's hard work and modesty . And . the surgery on October 15, his family was stunned by the . outpouring of support from his schoolmates - who have said Justin is the . kindest kid they know. 'Justin is one kid who is liked by . everybody,' his teacher Kim Bata told the Register. 'He's a sensitive, caring kid. All the kids agree: He's never said a mean thing about anyone else.' His mother Kelly Chey, who came to the U.S. with her family in 1984, has a full-time job with the school district but has struggled after splitting with her husband eight years ago. Justin's father stays in touch with him but lives out of state and cannot afford to travel to Iowa. Kelly said affording to live been possible with the help of her son, who has volunteered for odd jobs in his neighborhood to help with the income. Until his disease took over, Justin slept on the family's living room floor but now has been moved to the largest room. His . friends and teachers have visited him there, asking him what he wants . for his birthday on October 31, when he will turn 13 - but he says he . wants nothing. Concerns: 12-year-old Justin collapsed while in class at Hiatt Middle School, pictured, two weeks ago . Diagnosis: He was found to have a brain tumor and underwent surgery at the Mercy Medical Center . He smiled as his teacher added: 'Don't worry buddy. We're . getting meals, we're getting money for your mom... you donâ€™t need to . worry about anything.' Other classmates have made him get well cards or brought over home-cooked food for his family. School officials are also collecting money, aware that Chey will have to take time off work for Justin. 'I've told him: I'm here for you,' Chey said. 'Now, everyone is here to support you.'

A woman claims her dreams of motherhood have been ruined after she got food poisoning from a rotisserie chicken bought at Tesco. Lisa Fessey, 41, and her husband were overjoyed when doctors successfully transferred two embryos into her womb. But two days later she became severely ill after developing food poisoning caused by the chicken bought from Tesco. Days later, she was told the fertility procedure had failed. 'Heartbroken': Lisa Fessey claims her dreams of motherhood have been ruined after she got food poisoning from chicken bought at Tesco . Mrs Fessey, a travel agent, and her husband believe the campylobacter gastroenteretis caused by eating the rotisserie chicken was responsible for her failure to become pregnant. And they fear that after having now used both her IVF cycles available free on the NHS they have lost their last chance to start a family because they can’t afford to pay for private fertility treatment. The couple had been hopeful of success after their fertilised eggs were transferred successfully to her womb in June 2012, as the previous cycle of IVF had resulted in Mrs Fessey becoming pregnant, though she later miscarried. Mrs Fessey began to feel unwell after eating the chicken on July 2, bought from Tesco’s store at Wombwell, near Barnsley, two days after the IVF treatment. Soon after, she suffered severe diarrhoea. A couple of days later her GP sent her to Barnsley District General Hospital where she was placed on a drip for two nights. Days later she was told she had lost the embryos. Dashed hopes: Mrs Fessey, 41, was overjoyed when doctors successfully transferred two embryos into her womb. But two days later she became severely ill after developing food poisoning caused by the chicken bought from Tesco . After contacting London law firm Slater & Gordon Mrs Fessey issued a civil claim against Tesco. The supermarket admitted liability in relation to the food poisoning last summer but has not admitted that this resulted in the loss of the embryos. The couple are now pursuing a compensation claim. 'It is just devastating for us,' said Mrs Fessey, from Barnsley. 'We had suffered years of heartache and frustration and believed we would finally be able to start a family of our own. 'It was such a crushing blow for us, as realistically it was our last chance. 'We are no longer entitled to IVF on the NHS and we cannot afford to pay for it privately, so we hoped Tesco would help - but they turned us down. 'When they told me the embryos had failed I was heartbroken, I knew it was my last chance as we simply cannot afford to do it privately and at 41,  my chance of success are plummeting every day.' An environmental health officer from . Barnsley Council visited the chicken counter at the Tesco store in . Wombwell and noted a number of potential health concerns including poor . handling of raw chicken and insufficient cleaning practices of . preparation surfaces. Once . she knew the cause of her illness, Mrs Fessey decided to write to Tesco . and in the hope that the supermarket giant would cover the cost of a . new cycle of IVF. Despair: Days after suffering food poisoning, she was told the fertility procedure had failed . Mrs . Fessey said: Lisa said: 'There is no way we can afford the £3,000 to . have another round of IVF so I hope that Tesco will do the decent thing . and pay for it for us. 'Time is not on our side so I hope something can be resolved as soon as possible before our dreams of having a family have gone for good.' But Dr David Ogutu, a consultant gynaecologist in the NHS and at the Herts and Essex Fertility Centre, said it is unlikely the food poisoning affected the success of Mrs Fessey's IVF. He told MailOnline: 'It is impossible to prove what effect the food poisoning had. But it is very unlikely to have affected it, in my opinion. 'The vast majority of women at her age who have embryos put back in would have a negative pregnancy test. 'At 41, there is only about a 20-25 per . cent chance she would have a positive pregnancy test - and a 15 to 20 . per cent chance of taking home a baby. Claim: Mrs Fessey is now hoping Tesco will fund another round of IVF, as she has used up her allowance on the NHS. But doctors have warned her age is against her . 'As a woman ages, there is a higher chance of the embyros being abnormal and not implanting.' Jane Cooper, personal injury lawyer at Slater & Gordon, who is representing Lisa, said: 'This has been a harrowing experience for Mrs Fessey and her partner. 'Their expectations of a pregnancy running to full term were cruelly destroyed by Tesco’s simple failure to follow straightforward food hygiene requirements. 'They can take some comfort though from Tesco’s final acceptance of their wrongdoing and we are now focused on getting them the best compensation settlement to allow them a chance of fulfilling their dream of having a child.' A spokesperson for Tesco said: 'Providing safe food is our absolute priority, and we have thorough cleaning routines to maintain the highest standards in our stores. 'We listen carefully to any complaint that we failed to meet our very high standards and as soon as we became aware of Mrs Fessey's complaint we took urgent action to check our hygiene and cleaning routines. We are working to resolve her complaint.'","Lisa Fessey had two embryos successfully transferred into her womb .

The close-fitting and far-from-revealing underwear is not a requirement for Mormons. But the bulky cotton T-shirt and long shorts need to be hidden beneath clothes, even during the summer months. It is strictly not for public display. Those worshippers that do wear a Temple garment must keep it on day and night. It must also be worn when entering a temple, hence its name. The image showing Mr Romney wearing the underwear ties in with his campaign tales of life as a Mormon missionary in France in the 1960s. He has revealed, with little detail spared, how he defecated into a bucket while serving. His and hers: The Temple garment typically covers the shoulders and extends to the knees, in deference to rules surrounding the Church of the Latter Day Saints' temples . Mr Romney said he spent . two-and-a-half years knocking on doors as he was greeted by locals with . guns, or their barking dogs chasing at his heels. These claims of a hard life since have been disputed by other missionaries. What is clear is that Mr Romney’s . mission to France took him through Le Havre, Paris and Bordeaux, . promoting a church which now has 14million members globally. The Church of Jesus Christ of .

He won both the Maine caucuses and a poll of conservative activists gathered in Washington - a double boost that could help steady his White House campaign after last week’s shock defeats. The former Massachusetts governor won 39 per cent of the vote in Maine, three points ahead of the maverick libertarian Ron Paul. Rick Santorum, who swept the board in Missouri, Colorado and Minnesota last Tuesday secured 18 per cent with Newt Gingrich languishing in fourth on just 6 per cent. In a straw poll at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington, Mr Romney won 38 per cent of the 3,408 votes cast, ahead of Mr Santorum on 31 per cent, Mr Gingrich on 15 and Dr Paul on 12. Dr Paul had made a major play for Maine in the hope of chalking up his first victory of the 2012 campaign.

A mother has been permanently scarred by a love heart tattoo she got in honour of her daughter. Nicola Hickman, 37, had a severe allergic reaction to the tattoo on her ankle. It became bumpy before breaking out into a large, excruciatingly painful growth. Nicola Hickman, 37, suffered a severe allergic reaction to the red dye in a love heart tattoo she had in honour of her daughter, Chenai. She has been left with a permanent scar on her ankle . Her allergy to the tattoo’s red ink was confirmed by doctors after the growth, which had become so large that it prevented her from wearing boots, was surgically removed. She said: ‘I kept using antiseptic cream like I was told, and prayed the swelling would go down, but it didn’t. ‘I thought it was a mysterious reaction which would go away eventually, but it got to the point where I couldn’t bear it any more. Even just to touch it was really painful.’ Miss Hickman and her partner of 17 years Leslie Mkwah chose to get tattoos as permanent expressions of love for their seven-year-old daughter, Chenai. Mr Mkwah, 37, a heating engineer, elected to have Chenai’s name tattooed on his back, while Miss Hickman, an accountant, chose a small heart-shaped design on her right ankle – it was her first tattoo. She said: ‘I’d always wanted a tattoo and I like the heart image. I wanted it done for my daughter because I knew she would like it. Shortly after the tattoo was completed, Ms Hickman noticed it was turning 'bumpy' (pictured) Ms Hickman's tattoo turned into a protruding and extremely painful growth which was so big she could not wear boots. She was forced to turn to her doctor for help and was referred to St Thomas' Hospital . ‘Getting the tattoo done wasn’t particularly painful. I managed to keep chatting while the tattoo artist worked. ‘At first it was fine. But then, six weeks later, I noticed that the tattoo was bumpy and the red colour was fading. ‘I went back to the tattooist to ask his opinion, and he said he would be happy to top up the colour when the bumps went down. He advised using antiseptic cream. ‘But the weeks went on and it got worse. I tried to ignore it, but it got to the point where I couldn’t think of anything else. I couldn’t wear proper footwear and I couldn’t sleep on it.’ Ms Hickman had surgery to remove the growth (left) but was left with an open . wound (right) which became infected. She had to spend two days in . hospital while she fought the infection . Eventually Miss Hickman, of Greenwich, London, went to see a doctor. In June 2013, 11 months after she had the tattoo done, she was referred to St Thomas’ Hospital in central London where specialists were able to remove the flaky growth, which was by now protruding from her ankle. She said: ‘The dermatologists took one look at it and were shocked. They’d never seen an allergic reaction like it before. They took pictures which they wanted to use for a report in a medical journal. ‘The surgeon who removed the growth tried to make it so the scar was heart-shaped. She said, “Nicola wanted a heart, so let’s try and give her a heart”. They looked after me really well.’ Ms Hickman has been left with a permanent scar on her ankle (pictured) but, despite her ordeal, decided to have another tattoo - this time she had one which did not require red ink . Unfortunately, the wound took longer than anticipated to heal and a month after the operation Miss Hickman spent two days in hospital fighting an infection. She said: ‘When I had the operation they had to leave me with an open wound. They couldn’t do skin grafts because of the position of nerves and a nearby artery. I needed to change the dressings constantly.’ She is now left with a four centimetre scar on her ankle. She said: ‘I’ve had another tattoo done of my daughter’s name in black ink on my neck and I’ve never had any problems with it. ‘They’re still not sure what it was in the red ink which caused the allergic reaction. It might have been a metallic chemical. My ankle’s still not perfectly healed, but I’m glad the growth has gone.’","Nicola Hickman got tattoo on her ankle as a sign of her love for her daughter .

Spared jail: Police constable James Kiddie, 45, was caught on camera punching a suspected woman shoplifter three times in the head . A policeman was caught on CCTV repeatedly punching a suspected woman shoplifter in the head. James Kiddie attacked Sarah Reed after she was detained by security staff at Uniqlo in Regent Street, London. But despite being convicted of assault yesterday the 45-year-old constable escaped with just a community order. The . shocking camera footage shows the married father-of-two grabbing his . 30-year-old victim by the hair and lifting her out of a chair, while another camera captured him punching her three times as she lay in a corridor trying to shield herself. Kiddie was convicted of assault last month and was today sentenced to a 12 month community order, requiring him to undertake 150 hours of unpaid work. The father-of two had been called to the Uniqlo branch, after Ms Reed was held by security guards in November 2012, the court heard. CCTV footage showed him removing his overcoat and jacket before searching the woman's handbag. He was then seen forcing her back into a chair, before appearing to grab her hair with both hands, ripping off her hat and dragging her to the floor. The pictures show him hitting her on the head as she lay on the ground, before leaning on her neck until back-up arrived. Kiddie claimed Ms Reed, a drug user, had bitten him after telling him she was infected with the AIDS virus. During the trial last month Kiddie had told the court that his strikes against Ms Reed were 'half power' and he had not wanted to hit her. He had claimed the woman was ‘snarling like a dog’ and bit him after telling him ‘I’ve got AIDS and I bite tramps like you.’ Pointing to the CCTV footage, Kiddie had said: ‘She is now biting into my index finger and she’s telling me she’s got the AIDS virus.’ ‘I didn’t want to break a lady’s nose... I didn’t want to hurt her somewhere that is going to damage,’ he said. Caught on camera: CCTV footage played at Westminster Magistrates' Court showed the officer (right) removing his overcoat and jacket before searching the woman's handbag . Action: He was then seen forcing her back into a chair, before appearing to grab her hair with both hands, ripping off her hat . Guilty: Kiddie was convicted of assault last month following a three day trial . Scotland Yard said fellow officers who . had viewed the CCTV footage had been concerned by the level of force . used by Kiddie during the arrest and had reported the incident to the . Met’s Directorate of Professional Standards (DPS). Prosecutor . Rupert Kent told the court that Kiddie had no previous convictions, but . the Met officer had two previous disciplinary findings of 'incivility' against him on his police record. He was investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission for deploying CS Gas during a UK Uncut protest on Oxford Street in January 2011. Mr Kent also pointed out that it was Ms Reed who was initially charged with assault upon her attacker. His defence counsel, Ben Brandon, told . the court he would be dismissed from the Metropolitan Police as a result . of the court’s findings. Mr Brandon said the punches aimed by Kiddie had lasted a 'split second' and only one, in effect, had 'really made contact'. He said being bitten had come as a 'complete shock' to Kiddie. He added that Kiddie had spent 12 years in the Met 'serving the people of London' and now faced losing his job. ‘Twelve years as a police officer gone in an instant - as a result of a momentary lapse of control,' said Mr Brandon. Call out: The father-of two had been called to the Uniqlo branch, after Ms Reed was held by security guards in November 2012 . Worry: Scotland Yard said fellow officers who had viewed the CCTV footage had been concerned by the level of force used by Kiddie during the arrest . Impact: The woman is then dragged to the floor . He added: ‘The punches were in anger, a retaliation for the pain caused by the bite. Kiddie was told by District Judge Elizabeth Roscoe that Ms Reed was a woman who had 'used violence in similar circumstances to avoid the consequences of her own actions and her dishonesty'. She added: 'This was no shrinking violet, this woman, but, as a police officer, obviously higher standards are required from you. 'I do accept, as I say, that this was an incident of loss of control. There is no pre-meditation.' Judge Roscoe, sentencing Kiddie to a 150-hour community order, said she accepted that his actions had been 'an instinctive and immediate retaliation in anger.' She added that evidence on CCTV and of witnesses was that Ms Reed - described in court as a drug addict who was later convicted of shoplifting - was a 'difficult' and 'aggressive' woman who had become more aggressive when the police officer arrived. Kiddie, attached to Westminster borough, was found guilty of common assault by Judge Roscoe last month after a three-day trial. Force: The CCTV pictures show him hitting her on the head as she lay on the ground . Account: Kiddie claimed Ms Reed, a drug user, had bitten him after telling him she was infected with the AIDS virus . Sentence: District Judge Elizabeth Roscoe told Kiddie that Ms Reed was ' no shrinking violet', but that 'as a police officer, obviously higher standards are required from you' At the hearing today, he was also ordered to pay £500 in prosecution costs, and a £60 victim surcharge. The judge added that she did not ‘deem’ compensation was appropriate, despite the violent nature of the attack. Dressed in a blue anorak, white shirt and blue spotted tie, the officer, from Ruislip, west London appeared extremely relieved as he strained to hear from the glass dock. Speaking after sentence, Ms Reed’s solicitor Victoria Hatton said: ‘Ms Reed was the victim of a brutal attack by a serving police officer, PC James Kiddie, on 26 November 2013 in the detention room at the UniQlo store in Regent Street, London. ‘As seen in the video footage played to the court, PC Kiddie threw Ms Reed to the floor where a lightbulb smashed and caused her to suffer a 2cm laceration to her lower back. ‘This was followed by three powerful strikes aimed at Ms Reed’s head. Claims Kiddie had said the woman was 'snarling like a dog' and bit him after telling him 'I've got AIDS and I bite tramps like you' Jeopardy: The court was told that Kiddie had spent 12 years in the Met 'serving the people of London' and now faced losing his job . ‘In light of recent media stories of police corruption, the conviction highlights a small step forward in the punishment of police officers who chose to act in this way. ‘It sends an important message to those police officers who are there to protect but instead abuse that power and fail to uphold the rule of law.’ The . Met's territorial policing assistant commissioner Simon Byrne said: . 'Police officers join the Met to protect and serve the public. Today his . colleagues will be sickened by what they see. 'Wrong': The Met's territorial policing assistant commissioner Simon Byrne said that Kiddie (pictured) had been held accountable for his behaviour . 'Where . an officer's behaviour falls short of the very high standards that we . and the public expect of them, then it is only right that they are held . to account for their actions. 'The . actions of one officer abusing his position in this way can cast a . shadow over the thousands of officers who are on duty right now . demonstrating bravery, compassion, integrity and professionalism. 'Pc . Kiddie's behaviour that day, which was identified and reported by . another officer, was wrong. For that he has been held accountable. There . is no place in the Metropolitan Police Service for officers and staff . who do not uphold our values.' The . Met said in a statement that Pc Kiddie was the subject of two . substantiated complaints - in 2008 for lack of courtesy and respect and . in 2011 for discriminatory comments. He was also due to face a misconduct meeting this month with regard to the discharge of CS gas at a demonstration in January 2011, the Met added. This process will be reviewed following today's hearing. 'Pc Kiddie has been suspended and he will be subject to a special misconduct hearing as soon as the police regulations allow,' the statement said.The Independent Police Complaints Commission ruled last year that Kiddie should face a misconduct hearing following the CS gas incident. A spokesman said: 'The evidence showed that an officer sprayed protesters at close proximity within a crowded area, in breach of Acpo guidance on the use of CS spray. 'When an officer does that, their decision to use the spray must come under the closest scrutiny. 'Having viewed all the available evidence, the IPCC felt there was insufficient justification for his actions. 'We have now asked the MPS to hold a misconduct meeting for the officer and to review why no paperwork was filled out following use of the spray.'","Pc James Kiddie, 45, attacked Sarah Reed in London branch of Uniqlo .

Taking vitamin C to ward off a cold only helps if you exercise regularly, new research suggests. Finnish researchers have found necking drinks rich in vitamin C - such such as orange juice - makes no difference to couch potatoes. But in people who work out, vitamin C can halve the risk and even help get rid of the sniffles. Drinking orange juice won't reduce the risk of a cold - unless you exercise . Scientists from the University of Helsinki embarked on a series of studies involving more than 11,000 people to work out the benefits of Vitamin C, found in many vegetables and fruits, such as oranges, strawberries and kiwis. They gave groups of volunteers, including Swiss school children, marathon runners, teenage competitive swimmers and Canadian soldiers, a dose of the vitamin and then assessed its impact on their health. The researchers discovered that it halved the risk of catching a cold among people under short term physical stress, such as exercise. And male teenage swimmers who caught a cold and were treated with the supplement shook off their illness twice as quickly as boys who didn't take the vitamin. The researchers also found that children also appear to be more responsive to the vitamin than adults, with a daily one gram dose slashing the average duration of colds in children by 18 per cent and in adults by 8 per cent. Adults on average only have two or three colds a year, whereas children suffer, on average, half a dozen annually. Children also appear to be more responsive to the vitamin than adults . The study's authors, Harri Hemild and Elizabeth Chalker, concluded: 'The failure of vitamin C supplementation to reduce the incidence of colds in the general population indicates that routine vitamin C supplementation is not justified, yet vitamin C may be useful for people exposed to brief periods of severe physical exercise. 'Regular supplementation trials have shown that vitamin C reduces the duration of colds, but this was not replicated in the few therapeutic trials that have been carried out.' Research published last week found that men who take vitamin C supplements every day double their risk of suffering from kidney stones. The excruciating condition is on the rise - and Swedish researchers say a bi-product of the vitamin may be to blame. Men who took vitamin C supplements at least once a day had the highest risk of kidney stones, according to research published in the journal JAMA Internal medicine.","Vitamin makes no difference to couch potatoes .

A news species of crocodile that lived 126million years ago has been discovered after a pair of a pair of skull fragments were found three months apart. Two fragments of crocodile fossils were found by two different collectors and led to the discovery of the ancient button-toothed crocodile. A new species of crocodile which walked the earth 126 million years ago has been discovered after a pair of skull fragments were found three months apart. It is known as the button-toothed crocodile and is thought to have measured around 2ft long . The new species lived 126million years ago alongside dinosaurs. It is thought to have been around 2ft long from nose to tail. For now, the species has been named Koumpiodontosuchus aprosdokiti, which means the 'unexpected button toothed crocodile.' The creature's button-shaped teeth were used to crush mollusc shells and other invertebrates with tough outer coatings. The button-toothed crocodile is also a new genus of ancient crocodile closely related to, but subtly different, to those alive today. Based upon the two fragments, which were pieced together on the Isle of Wight and together measure around 11cm long, the animal is thought to have been around 2ft long from nose to tail. A piece from the back half of the crocodile’s skull was found on a beach near Sandown on the island by collector Diane Trevarthen. She was on a fossil-hunting holiday with her family and took the fragment straight to Dinosaur Isle museum in Sandown to show staff. At first, they thought it might be part of a skull belonging to a baby of one of the island's known large Cretaceous crocodiles. But that theory changed three months later when Austin and Finley Nathan, who were also fossil-hunting on the island, found another tiny fragment of skull in the same area. They too took their find, which turned out to be a snout, to the museum and staff recalled that they had seen the back part of a similar small skull a few months before. Two fragments of the ancient crocodile's skull were discovered (pictured), including a piece of its snout that shows rows of teeth, which palaeontologists think were used to crush molluscs . Ms Trevarthen returned her part of the . specimen to the museum after staff contacted her and it fitted . perfectly together with the snout. Both collectors have donated their specimens to the museum to allow scientific study of the complete skull. For now, the species has been named Koumpiodontosuchus aprosdokiti, which means the 'unexpected button toothed crocodile.' ‘The collectors were simply walking along the beach looking for fossils when they saw these peculiar stones sitting on rocks, said University of Portsmouth palaeontologist Dr Steve Sweetman who has published a paper on the discovery in the journal Acta Palaeontologica Polonica. ‘But the first collector realised it was a fossil when they saw teeth running along the side of it and the other picked up the snout months later. ‘The winter storms released them from the debris yet both parts of this wonderful little skull are in good condition. ‘This is most unusual when you consider crashing waves usually batter and blunt the edges of fossils like this within days or even hours of them being washed onto the beach. ‘Both parts must therefore have been found very soon after they were released from the mud and debris.’ The fragments measure 112mm long together - and mark the first ever discovery of this button-toothed crocodile. A fragment of skull from the back half of the animal's skull was found by collector Diane Trevarthen (pictured right with palaeontologist Dr Sweetman) when she was on a fossil hunting holiday on the Isle of Wight . He believes that the deposits would . have originally been laid down on a dinosaur trampled river floodplain . around 126 million years ago. ‘The sheer serendipity of this discovery is quite bizarre and finding the two parts is in itself remarkable,’ he said. ‘That they should be found three months apart by different collectors and taken to the museum where the same members of staff were on duty and therefore able to recall the first specimen defies belief.’ Dr Sweetman said teeth findings were first reported on the Isle of Wight in 1979 - but this is the first skull ever found. Close relatives of the tiny crocodile, known as Bernissartia fagesii, have been found in Belgium and Spain. ‘At first I thought the skull belonged to a crocodile known as Bernissartia fagesii known from skeletons of a similar age discovered first in Belgium and later in Spain,’ Dr Sweetman said. ‘I was convinced it was a Bernissartia skull because of its small size - the fully grown animal was only a little over two feet long from nose to tail. Dr Sweetman (pictured) believes that the deposits where the fossils were found would have originally been laid down on a dinosaur trampled river floodplain around 126 million years ago. 'The sheer serendipity of this discovery is quite bizarre and finding the two parts is in itself remarkable,' he said . ‘It’s button-shaped teeth are unique and they were used to crush mollusc shells and other invertebrates with tough outer coatings.’ However, closer examination soon revealed significant differences in the arrangement of bones - suggesting the skull may represent a new species. Dinosaur Isle's Gary Blackwell prepared the lower part of the skull to free it of minerals, revealing palate bones and the inner opening of the airway from the nose. Dr Sweetman said: ‘The position of this was most unexpected. The location of the hole in the mouth, where the airway from the nose opens, was surrounded by bones at the very back of the palate. ‘This tells us the discovery is not only a new species but also a new genus of ancient croc closely related to, but subtly different to those alive today.’","Two fragments of crocodile fossils were .

The researchers, including conservationist Cynthia Moss, believe the creatures use voice and language to help them work out which humans pose a threat to them. They can then choose whether to defend themselves against attack or continue going about life as usual. The researchers began my making recordings of members of two Kenyan tribes repeating the phrase ‘Look, look over there, a group of elephants is coming’. One tribe was the Massai, who historically killed elephants as a rite of passage on entering adulthood. They also take revenge when elephants kill their cattle. The researchers began my making recordings of members of two Kenyan tribes repeating the phrase 'Look, look over there, a group of elephants is coming'. One tribe was the Massai, (pictured) who historically killed elephants as a rite of passage on entering adulthood . The second was the Kamba, who farm crops and have a more amicable relationship with the elephants. The tapes were then played through loudspeakers to groups of elephants in the Amboseli National Park in Kenya and their reactions noted. The animals were clearly more scared of the Massai and bunched together defensively on hearing them speak. They also used their trunks to sniff at the air on hearing a Massai voice, likely in an attempt to pick up smells that would provide more information about the intruder. As the same phrase was used in all the recordings and it was spoken in the same way each time, it is believed the animals were able to tell the two languages apart. Their skill didn’t end there. The elephants were also more likely to act defensively on hearing a male Massai than female. They were also more likely to retreat on hearing a grown man than a boy. Elephants grieve like humans and are believed to suffer from post traumatic stress . Grieving: Elephants grieve like humans, shedding tears and taking part in rituals to 'bury' bodies. And the damaging effects of grief from death - especially of a parent - stay with them for decades, according to recent research at the University of Sussex. The study has found that African elephants who were orphaned by a cull in Kruger National Park in the 1970s and 1980s are still suffering post-traumatic stress. Singing: The large creatures use an ultrasound rumble - often too low for humans to hear - to keep a herd together and for males to find mates. By doing this, they can communicate six miles away . Sneaking: Elephants carry out raids on crops when the nights are the darkest and scientists have found that their foraging expeditions in Africa tend to vary with the lunar cycle. Fewer raids take place during a full moon when farmers are more likely to spot the animals plundering their crops. It is thought that elephants deliberately alter their behaviour to reduce the risks of encountering humans. Remembering: Older elephants remember dangerous situations and are able to best make crucial decisions about predators, based on their previous perilous experiences. When scientists played families lion roars from a loudspeaker, those with older matriarchs correctly focused their defensive reactions on male lions that are the most adept killers. Pointing: A study published last year found that jungle elephants instinctively known what pointing means - and are the only animal capable of this feat. Professor Richard Byrne from St Andrews University said: ‘What elephants share with humans is that they live in an elaborate and complex network in which support, empathy, and help for others are critical for survival.’","Elephants can distinguish a warlike tribe from a more peaceable people by listening to their voices .

The smart cat-flap (pictured) keeps animals inside when it detects rain, but keeps them out at pre-programmed times . Cat-flaps can save owners from having to get up at the crack of dawn to let their cat or dog out. But they can be draughty and let animals stroll in and out while trampling mud as they go. Now there’s a smart cat-flap - and even a dog-flap - that can keep animals inside when it detects rain, but can keep them out a pre-programmed times. The PetWALK automatic cat door also claims to be windproof and thermally insulated to keep drafts out, as well as trapping noise and dust outside. The company says: ‘PetWALK keeps wind and weather outside and your home warm. It saves energy and is the perfect solution for low-energy house.’ However, all this comes at a price of £1,282.50 for a cat-flap and £1,417.50 for the larger version designed for dogs. The flap works by detecting an animal wearing a small microchip. It automatically locks and unlocks to seal the door when a pet wearing a matching chip approaches it. The cat-flap claims to offer one of the most powerful animal-chip reader systems on the market and supports implanted chips as well as chips worn on a pet's collar. It only allows a certain cat wearing the chip in or out, to keep other people’s pets out of the home. The system can be programmed to keep animals inside or outside at certain times, which could be used to force lazy pets to get some fresh air or to keep feisty cats inside at night. The device also works in collaboration with sensors that can be placed outside and can detect when it’s raining to stop pets getting out – or to let them in.

It costs £1,282.50 for a cat-flap and £1,417.50 for the larger version designed for dogs. The smart cat-flap also comes with an alarm system that prevents burglars from gaining access to a home via the flap, which can be a particular problem for larger dog-flaps. The Austrian company claims cat-flaps should be like any other window or door in a home. ‘We humans don't squeeze ourselves through holes! Why need our pets to do so? PetWALK is the first real high quality entry door for pets,’ it says. The door is airtight and well insulated so that it meets criteria for low energy buildings and claims to save homeowners energy and money in the long-run. The flap has six centimetres of insulation and two silicon seals to keep the heat inside a house. It is also available in a number of changeable designs so that owners can choose to match their door with a certain colour or wood effect, or opt for a more opulent faux stained glass window. The smart cat and dog door can be programmed so keep pets inside or outside at certain times.

For many women, trying to balance childcare responsibilities with a busy career can be a struggle. Middle-class mothers are quitting high powered jobs because they are not prepared to behave like men by getting into work early and staying out late socialising, a new study claims. Women are more likely to ditch a highly paid job that clashes with childcare responsibilities, rather than compete with men in their office, British researchers said. Trying to have it all: Women are more likely to ditch a highly paid job that clashes with childcare responsibilities, rather than compete with men in their office, researchers said . Despite some gains in equality, workplace culture is still male dominated, said workplace psychologists from the University of Leicester's School of Management. This means that workplaces could be losing well qualified and capable female executives rather than adapt the culture to suit working mothers. Middle-class mothers are quitting high powered jobs because they are not prepared to behave like men by getting into work early and staying out late socialising (illustrated), the study claims . ‘Middle-class working mothers are leaving work because they are unwilling to behave like men,’ said report authors Emma Cahusac and Shireen Kanji. ‘Mothers in professional and managerial jobs are expected to stay late or get in early even if they have negotiated reduced working hours. ‘And (they are expected) to socialise with colleagues or clients in the evenings - even though this clashes with their childcare responsibilities. ‘They must do so because working culture is still organised by men, who are less involved in childcare. Many mothers respond by leaving their jobs. ‘Unless mothers mimic successful men, they do not look the part for success in organisations.’ Their study, which is based on interviews with professional women in different sectors, found that it is not just men who are guilty of creating a hostile environment for working mothers. Female employees without children are quite happy to promote and join in with the macho culture, they found. One mother, who used to work as a banker, said when she left as 6pm to look after her children she would get 'barbed comments' from a female co-worker who did not have children. The study found that it is not just men who are guilty of creating a hostile environment for working mothers. Female employees without children are happy to promote and join in with the macho culture (illustrated) the researchers said. Some women hide the fact they are mothers to avoid falling foul of hostile attitudes, according to the report that was published in the journal Gender, Work and Organisation. The researchers interviewed 26 women who had left work after having children or getting pregnant in reach their conclusions. Many of the women said they were 'side-lined' on their return to the office after giving birth. 'Many women leave high-powered jobs because they are relegated to lesser roles and feel the need to suppress their identities as mothers,' the study said. ‘This is not only unfair. As an economy, we cannot afford to waste such skilled and educated workers.’ Boys whose fathers work very long hours are more likely to become tearaways, according to research published last summer. A study of more than 1,400 children found those whose fathers worked more than 55 hours a week were more delinquent and aggressive than their peers, yet the same phenomenon was not identified in daughters. Further research now needs to be carried out to discover why this happens in males, and to look for ways to tackle it. The study was run by the Social Science Research Centre in Berlin, but was based in Western Australia where one in five fathers work at least 55 hours week when their children were between five and eight. Mothers' working hours did not seem to matter, although few Australian mothers worked long hours, according to the study. Dr Jianghong Li, of The Social Science Research Centre, Berlin, said: 'It is possible when fathers work very long hours, children are less well monitored after school, especially if mothers also work full time hours. 'There is some evidence pre-adolescent boys are less well monitored than girls when fathers have high work related demands, including long hours, and as a consequence have more conduct problems.' The culture of working long hours, which has crept into many jobs should be the next policy frontier, said the researchers.","Workplace psychologists said women are quitting their jobs because they can't fit long hours and staying out late socialising with childcare .

From dried out monkey heads and antelope skulls to dead birds and crates of baby crocodiles, the wares on sale at the Marche des Feticheurs in the Togolese capital, Lomé, are unusual to say the least. The largest voodoo pharmacy in the world, the market offers a cornucopia of bizarre cures such as 'strengthening' elephant femur bones and rails festooned with boa constrictor skins which are thought to cure burns by locals. 'Monkey heads are a . favourite among students come finals time,' explains Constantine James, the photographer who captured these incredible images. 'They’re the voodoo study . stimulant.' Strengthening: One of the younger vendors poses with a set of antelope horns at the fetish market in the Togolese capital, Lomé . Gruesome: Tradespeople at the market hold some of the fetishes on sale, among them a dried leopard head and a live tortoise . Heavyweight: A muscular vendor smiles as he hefts an elephant femur (thigh bone) above his head. The bone is thought to confer strength on the person taking it . And monkeys aren't the only animal to end up in the market. Sharing the shelves with primates are shrunken heads that once belonged to dogs, donkeys, hyenas and even leopards. Other beasts turned into voodoo medicine and hawked by vendors include elephants, hippos, antelopes, whales and living eagles, although for the birds at least, an appearance at the market isn't the end of the road. 'The living hawks are not . sacrificed,' reveals James. 'Someone who is possessed by an evil spirit will buy the . hawk, have a voodoo priest transfer the black spirit to the unknowing . hawk, and then let the hawk go free. He also has a recipe for a voodoo love potion. 'If you grind up a dried chameleon into a powder, mix it with . Chanel No. 5 and spray it on yourself, you . will magically attract the one you secretly admire,' he reveals. But making a living from providing voodoo cures isn't without its risks. 'Moments after we arrived at the market, the police showed up and arrested a man for being in possession of illegal animal products,' remembers James. Muscular: A young Togolese boy shoulders an enormous whale vertebrae. Like elephant femurs, whale vertebrae are believed to confer strength .

Charms: Dried monkey heads, such as these baboon bonces held by a youthful vendor, are thought to be a stimulant while hawks (right) are used to get rid of curses . 'We were wondering what he possibly could have had considering the strange products people weren't getting arrested for.' Despite the risk of falling foul of anti-trafficking laws, vendors have been selling fetishes at the Lomé . market for at least 40 years, although locals claim . that sales have been going on for more than a . century. Voodoo too has long been a popular part of life in Togo, which although more commonly . associated with Haiti, originated in West Africa and is the official state religion in neighbouring Benin. The cures associated with the religion are much in demand at the market according to James, with shoppers willing to pay as much as £200 for a dried out hyena head or £80 for a bracelet made from elephant tail bones. 'Elephant femur and whale vertebrae are . used to strengthen bones or for skeletal issues,' he explains. 'You can buy a hyena . head for under £200, while £80 will get you an elephant tail to make into a . bracelet to protect against black magic.

With more than 2.5 million adherents in Togo and 1.7 million in Benin, voodoo, or vodun as it's locally known, is one of the most popular West African religions. Like the better known Haitian voudou, the religion centres on spirit worship; whether powerful deities that control forces of nature or humble presences that inhabit rivers, trees and rocks. Togolese voodoo worshippers also pray to their ancestors and believe that the spirits of the dead walk side by side with the living, and can be asked to intercede for them with Mawu or Nana Buluku - the mother goddess who occupies the most important place in the vodun pantheon. Worship is led by women, with each family clan headed by a matriarch who leads prayers on behalf of the clan. Although they take a lead role in rituals, they are not priestesses; a term used solely for women who belong to each clan's spiritual 'convent'. Talismans such as the fetishes pictured, are thought to contain some of the divine power that adherents believe suffuses every living being on the planet, and can confer healing on the people who use it. Along with Togo and Benin, other West African peoples to embrace vodun include the Ewe people of eastern and southern Ghana, and the Yoruba of southwestern Nigeria.

An artificial pancreas, a smart bed that massages you to sleep, and washing up gloves with a built-in soap dispenser are among the 20 shortlisted inventions of this year's British Inventor's Project. Other finalists include the Kikka Digga, a . clip-on device that makes digging in the garden easier, and the . Hydroguard, designed as a portable flood defence system. The project's finalists will be showcased at the Gadget Show Live in April and visitors will be able to use the products that have been specifically designed to help with everyday tasks. A total of 20 inventions have been shortlisted as part of the British Inventors Project, including the Wi-Fi enabled bed from Balluga, illustration pictured. It is a smart interactive bed with adjustable firmness, climate control and a built-in vibro massage system . All of the finalists will also present their products live on stage in the Innovation Theatre throughout the show, and one will be crowned British Innovation of the Year 2014. The artificial pancreas, currently going through pre-clinical trials, was designed by Renfrew Group with support from researchers at De Montfort University. It automatically regulates glucose levels using a so-called polymeric gel that manages the delivery of insulin into the peritoneum. It does not rely on the kind of electronic controls used in current artificial organs. The Artificial Pancreas is an implantable device which has been designed specifically for sufferers of Type 1 diabetes - a large proportion of which are at risk of over or under medicating with current treatment methods, according to the inventors. The HydroGuard invention, pictured, is a reusable flood protection device that can be quickly put in place by homeowners. It fits any door type and is expandable, meaning the unit expands to fit any door size. It works by sealing the door and prevents water from being able to get through . The Kikka Digga device, illustration pictured left, is an invention designed to 'overcome the laborious task of digging.' It attaches to any garden fork or spade, pictured right, and has a step that's used to place more evenly spread pressure and force to the digger. The product is currently at final prototype phase . The Commuter X4 rear lighting system for cyclists, pictured, was designed to give them better protection and make them more visible on the road at night . 'We have reached a critical point in the development of a device which could ultimately immeasurably improve lives,' said researcher Professor Taylor. The Balluga Bed is a smart interactive bed with adjustable firmness, climate control and a built-in vibro massage system, all with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity.

Truly sick: Sandy Nguyen, 28, is accused of falsely claiming her son had terminal cancer in order to con her Colorado community out of an estimated $25,000 . A Colorado woman is charged with the unimaginable crime of convincing her 6-year-old son, along with her entire community, that he had terminal cancer in order to scam thousands in charitable donations. Police announced Friday the arrest of Sandy Nguyen, 28, of Arapahoe County on charges she accepted $25,000 in donations using the appalling lie. There were even times the boy, and everyone else, believed he'd gone into remission and once when Nguyen allegedly said the 'he probably only had 8 more months with them.' 'We don't have any reason to believe . that anyone other than her knew the truth,' Arapahoe County Sheriff's . Captain Larry Etheridge told KMGH. 'The little boy believed he had . cancer. The rest of the family believed he had cancer.' September . 2012 is when police say Nguyen started falsely telling members of her . community that the boy had been diagnosed the previous April with 'an . aggressive, rare, stage 3 childhood bone cancer and Acute Myelogenous . Leukemia.' A 5K charity walk . was even held for the boy. A website for the event says the boy had . 'received 317 days of chemotherapy, 7 days of radiation, multiple blood . & platelet transfusions, monthly spinal taps, biopsies, and MRI's.' Sad: Police say the family even went to Disneyland on the donations. They believe only Nguyen knew the truth after she duped her family, the school and community and even the boy into thinking he had cancer . Astonishly, . the event's tickets were sold out and local businesses, in addition to . individuals, had contributed to a fund for the boy. The event's page notes that the boy was 'fighting cancer for the 3rd time.' It was the following June when Nguyen allegedly told people the boy had just months to live. Photos from Nguyen's Facebook page show a boy both with hair and at times with a bald head, as if he's endured chemotherapy. There are also photos of the family during a visit to Disneyland. The Facebook page was taken down after Nguyen's arrest. 'Over the last several months, Ms. Nguyen accepted at least $16,000.00 from that account, as well as a trip to Disneyland for herself and family, which was paid for by the donated funds,' officials told KMGH. Astonishing: The boy's elementary school and community even held a 5K charity walk in the boy's name. They created an account for the family and place $25,000 in it. Police have since reclaimed about $23,000 in cash from the family home . According to the school and sheriff's office and the boy's school, a total of $25,000 was raised and put into an account for the family. Rolling Hills Elementary School Principal Darla Thompson informed parents of the situation in a letter on Friday. She wrote: . 'We are deeply troubled by these allegations and saddened to learn that an adult may have taken advantage of an innocent child and our school community, . 'It is important for our community to continue to show support and compassion for this child, who is also a victim in this case. The child was wrongfully led to believe that he was ill, and he was not responsible for the parentâ€™s alleged actions.' On Thursday, Arapahoe County Sheriff's investigators executed a search warrant at Nguyen's home, recovering about $23,000 in cash.

Howard 'Bo' Callaway Sr., a former Georgia congressman, Army secretary and one of the founders of Callaway Gardens, died Saturday. He was 86. Callaway died at an assisted-living facility in Columbus from complications from a brain hemorrhage he suffered about two years ago, said Rachel Crumbley, a Callaway Gardens spokeswoman. His son Edward said in a statement that his family and the gardens family will miss him deeply. Pioneer: Howard 'Bo' Callaway, who served as secretary of the Army after becoming the first Republican from Georgia elected to the U.S. House of Representatives since the Civil War, died on Saturday at age 86 . Howard Callaway before a TV debate in 1966. Callaway was elected to Congress in 1964, becoming the first Republican congressman from Georgia since Reconstruction . 'While he may be gone in body, as a founder of Callaway Gardens with my grandparents, his spirit will live on in his love of and vision for Callaway Gardens,' Callaway's son said. Callaway was elected to Congress in 1964, becoming the first Republican congressman from Georgia since Reconstruction. He left Congress to run for governor in 1966. Callaway actually received 3,000 more votes than the Democratic nominee, segregationist Lester Maddox, but because former Gov. Ellis Arnall mounted a write-in campaign, no candidate received the majority needed to win. State law at the time did not allow for a general election runoff and instead, the Legislature was allowed to choose the next governor, and the Democratic-controlled body backed Maddox. Although he lost, he inspired a generation of young Republicans, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Georgia House Speaker David Ralston, R-Blue Ridge, was 12 in 1966 and told the newspaper he remembered even then the impact Callaway had. 'I grew up in a family of Republicans and Bo Callaway was what we had been waiting for,' Ralston said. 'I was in elementary school and I had my Blue Horse notebook and I had a 'Go Bo' sticker. And I remember being very proud.' In 1973, he was appointed Secretary of the Army. From 1970 until 2003, he was the principal owner and CEO of Crested Butte Mountain Resort in Colorado. In 1980, he unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate in Colorado and he was chairman of the state Republican Party there from 1981 until 1987. Bo and his wife in 1980: Callaway also helped managed the 1976 presidential campaign of Gerald Ford. He served as chairman of the Colorado Republican Party from 1981 to 1987. He is survived by five children . Callaway was born in LaGrange, Ga. He attended the Georgia Institute of Technology before leaving to become a cadet at the United States Military Academy at West Point. He graduated in 1949 with a military engineering degree. During his military career, Callaway served as a lieutenant. He was a platoon leader in Korea and a tactics instructor at Fort Benning. Callaway ended his military service in 1953 to return home and help his father develop and manage Callaway Gardens, a 6,500 acre garden and resort in Pine Mountain. Callaway was a rabid baseball fan and his boat, the O Be Joyful, was a favorite pastime and one that he relished sharing with his family. In celebration of Callaway's life, a memorial organ concert will be held Wednesday at the Ida Cason Callaway Memorial Chapel at Callaway Gardens.","'Bo' Callaway is a former secretary of the Army and was a congressman from Georgia .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 16:21 EST, 16 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 16:24 EST, 16 March 2014 . Defense attorneys say an Army general has agreed to a plea deal that includes the dropping of sexual assault charges against him. A news release Sunday from lawyers representing Brig. Gen. Jeffrey Sinclair says that he will plead to lesser charges in exchange for having the sexual assault charges dropped along with two others that might have required Sinclair to register as a sex offender. The news release says the agreement has been approved and signed by a high-ranking general overseeing the case. It says Sinclair will plead guilty to several other charges. New deal: Army Brigadier General Jeffrey Sinclair leaves the courthouse at Fort Bragg in Fayetteville, North Carolina last week. A captain, whose sexual-assault allegations against General Sinclair made him the focus of a rare court-martial for a high-ranking officer has had a plea deal accepted . Defense attorney Richard Scheff says in the news release that Sinclair is admitting to his mistakes and that it's time to put the matter to rest. Sinclair was accused of twice forcing a female captain to perform oral sex on him during a three-year extramarital affair. The judge in case Colnel James Pohl had last week declined to dismiss the charges outright. But he reviewed newly disclosed emails in Sinclair's case and said he found the appearance of 'unlawful command influence' in Fort Bragg officials' decision to reject a plea bargain with the general in January. The twist came with the Pentagon under heavy pressure from Congress and beyond to combat rape and other sex crimes in the military. Under the military code of justice, the decision was supposed to be decided solely on the evidence, not its broader political implications. But Pohl said the emails showed that the military officials who rejected the plea bargain had discussed a letter from the accuser's lawyer. Charges changed: Lawyers representing Sinclair said that he will plead to lesser charges in exchange for having the sexual assault charges dropped along with two others that might have required Sinclair to register as a sex offender . The letter warned that allowing the general to avoid trial would 'send the wrong signal.' Sinclair, 51 and the former deputy commander of the 82nd Airborne Division, was accused of twice forcing a female captain to perform oral sex on him in Afghanistan in 2011 during a three-year extramarital . He has admitted to the affair but denied assaulting the woman. The defense has portrayed the woman as a liar who concocted the allegations after she saw emails between Sinclair and another woman. Sinclair is believed to be the highest-ranking U.S. military officer court-martialed on sexual assault charges. The general’s punishment will not be determined until a judge finishes holding the sentencing hearing. Prosecutors are expected to argue for prison time, while defense lawyers will contend that officers in similar cases have not faced jail time and have been allowed to retire at reduced rank. Accused: Sinclair, a 51-year-old married father of two, is accused of twice forcing oral sex during a three-year affair he admitted to having with a junior female officer, including during deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan . As one example, they cite the recent case of an Army brigadier general who lost his command and paid a $5,000 fine but was allowed to keep his rank after it was determined he had assaulted a girlfriend and committed adultery. Had prosecutors proceeded with the sexual assault charges, General Sinclair would have faced the possibility of life in prison and permanent registration as a sex offender if convicted. Defense lawyers also say General Sinclair is willing to retire as a lieutenant colonel — two rungs below his current rank, and the last at which no illegal acts are alleged to have occurred — which would probably cost him more than $1 million in total retirement pay. Lead defense attorney Richard Scheff said Sinclair would not agree to plead guilty to any charges involving sexual assault or any charges that would result in his being required to register as a sex offender. 'He did not sexually assault anybody,' Scheff said. 'He did not threaten anybody. He's not maltreated anybody. We'd love to resolve the case. But if we can't, we look forward to our day in court and his vindication.' Adulterer: General Jeffrey Sinclair pleaded guilty yo committing adultery, which is a crime in the military . General Sinclair pleaded guilty . earlier this month to charges that included adultery, requesting . explicit photographs from female Army officers, possessing pornography . in a combat theater and seeking a date with a lieutenant. The . new guilty pleas expected to be entered Monday include disobeying a . commander’s order not to contact his mistress, using demeaning language . to refer to female officers and using a curse word when confronted about . that conduct, and misusing his government travel charge card. Even . though the defense team appeared optimistic it could reach a deal, . Scheff said it might still be weeks before the case is resolved. It is . now likely to happen far sooner. In . December, Sinclair had offered to plead guilty to some of the lesser . charges in exchange for the Army dropping the sexual assault charges, . but he was turned down. Sinclair's . plea offer was discussed in emails among a high-ranking . Washington-based Army lawyer, the prosecutors and the commanding general . overseeing the case. The judge said he doesn't think the whole case was tainted, just the decision on a plea agreement. The . judge also criticized prosecutors for not giving defense lawyers the . emails sooner: 'The only reason we are in this conundrum is because of . the government's late notice.' Rising star: Sinclair was once considered a rising star amongst military brass. His career is now likely to be over . Last . week, Sinclair pleaded guilty to three lesser charges involving . adultery with the captain and improper relationships with two other . female Army officers. Those . charges could bring 15 years in prison. A trial then began on the . remaining sexual assault charges, with a potential sentence of life in . prison. Sinclair's accuser . came out against a plea bargain on the sexual assault charges in a . December letter sent by her attorney, Capt. Cassie L. Fowler. Fowler . suggested that the proposal deal would 'have an adverse effect on my . client and the Army's fight against sexual assault.' 'Acceptance . of this plea would send the wrong signal to those senior commanders who . would prey on their subordinates by using their rank and position, . thereby ensuring there will be other victims like my client in the . future,' Fowler wrote. Stand by your man: Sinclair's wife has stood with him throughout the many allegations of sexual wrongdoing . Though . prosecutors deny any consideration was given to Fowler's comments about . the potential fallout, the emails turned over to the defense Saturday . show they did discuss her assertions. One top military lawyer at Fort . Bragg quoted her letter and said he found Fowler 'very preachy.' It . was Lt. Gen. James Anderson, as commander of Fort Bragg, who made the . final decision on whether to accept Sinclair's plea offer. Testifying . from Afghanistan by telephone, Anderson said Monday that he didn't . thoroughly read Fowler's letter. The only thing he weighed in rejecting . the deal was that the accuser wanted her day in court, he said. But . Anderson's testimony appeared to be contradicted by a December 20th . email he sent to a military lawyer. 'I have read the letter and made my . decision,' Anderson wrote. Fowler . said last Monday that the courtroom maneuvering over her letter was . 'nothing more than an attempt to take the focus off the general's gross . misconduct.'","The Army general prosecuted in the military’s most closely watched .

The Niagara River corridor from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario is renowned as a spectacular winter haven for hundreds of thousands of water birds. But this year's bitterly cold season has made it notable for something else: dead ducks.Biologists say carcasses began piling up by the hundreds in early January after the plunging temperatures started icing over nearly the entire Great Lakes, preventing the ducks from getting to the minnows that are their main source of food. Necropsies on dozens of birds have confirmed the cause: starvation.'All have empty stomachs. They're half the weight they should be,' said Connie Adams, a biologist in the state Department of Environmental Conservation's Buffalo office who has personally seen 950 dead birds. A dead red-breasted merganser duck sits on an examine table at the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation's wildlife health unit on Thursday . Biologist Joe Okoniewski examines a dead red-breasted merganser duck at the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation's wildlife health unit on Thursday . 'This is unprecedented. Biologists who've worked here for 35 years have never seen anything like this,' she said. 'We've seen a decline in tens of thousands in our weekly waterfowl counts.' It's a phenomenon that has been seen elsewhere along the Great Lakes, with news reports of diving ducks and other waterfowl turning up dead by the hundreds along the southern part of Lake Michigan. They've also been found in Lake St. Clair between Lakes Erie and Huron. 'It's a hard winter for ducks, like everything else,' said Russ Mason, wildlife director with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. Necropsies and toxicity analyses showed many of the Michigan ducks were subsisting on invasive zebra mussels, which caused the birds to have potentially toxic levels of selenium in their bodies, Mason said. Zebra mussels filter toxins from the water and pass them up the food chain. Most of the dead ducks seen in the upstate New York are red-breasted mergansers, which breed in northern Canada and Alaska and come south for the winter to the Great Lakes region. In most years, there are periods of freezing and thawing, providing enough breaks in the ice for them to dive for minnows. But this winter, it's been so bitterly cold for so long that the ice had pushed across 92.2 percent of the Great Lakes' surface area earlier this month, according to federal monitors, just short of the record 94.7 percent set in 1979. Biologists say the Niagara River also . has ice extending up to 100 yards off shore, creating a shelf where . minnows and shiners can hide. The Niagara River corridor from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario is renowned as a winter haven for water birds . There is evidence some waterfowl gave up and tried to fly farther south but were too weak to do so. Dead birds have been seen along shorelines, on docks and on the ice, their carcasses feasted upon by gulls and bald eagles. Two weeks ago, Adams said, there were 240,000 water birds in her area's weekly count. Last week, there were 43,000. It's unknown how many birds - which also included such species as scaup, canvasbacks and grebes - migrated elsewhere and how many died.At the DEC's Wildlife Health Unit near Albany, biologist Joe Okoniewski has refrigerators stuffed with bags of red-breasted mergansers sent by wildlife biologists on Lakes Erie and Ontario. The diving ducks are black and white with a rusty speckled breast, orange bill and an iridescent green head with a shaggy crest on the back. 'The skin is stuck tight to the body wall because there's no layer of fat underneath,' Okoniewski said, running a scalpel along the breastbone of a dead merganser. The gizzard and intestine were empty, except for a few normal parasites.'I've seen a couple with stomachs full of feathers and feathers all the way down through their intestines,' Okoniewski said. 'They're desperate for anything to eat. It's really sad.' Biologist Joe Okoniewski examines the ducks who he says died of starvation . Unlike mallard or black ducks, mergansers won't eat bread or other food people may offer. They only eat live fish. While the bird deaths are a natural event that can be documented but not changed, wildlife rehabilitators are trying to save birds that people find near death in snowbanks and parking lots. 'We've had over 160 since the beginning of January,' said Dawn Mazierski, a wildlife technician at the Erie County SPCA in Tonawanda. 'We have to tube-feed them a liquid diet three to four times a day until they're strong enough to eat on their own.' The birds, which spend all their time on water, can hardly walk, and often their natural waterproofing is damaged by dirt or road salt so they can't swim either. 'They soak up water like a sponge and sink,' Mazierski said. So the birds rest in a quiet room on net hammocks called loon beds, preening their feathers back to condition. When they're ready, they go into tubs of water stocked with minnows donated by bait shops. 'A merganser can eat 200 to 250 fish per day,' Mazierski said. 'We go through thousands of fish a day.' After anywhere from three days to a couple of weeks, the birds are ready for release. 'Once their weight has increased and they're real spunky, and we have a decent weather day, we take them back out,' Mazierski said. 'And we hope they'll find enough food to bulk up for their flight north in spring.'","'We've seen a decline in tens of thousands in our weekly waterfowl counts,' said Connie Adams, a biologist .

Jewish communities around the world put on a colourful display over the weekend to celebrate the festival of Purim. The carnival-like holiday is marked by parades and costume parties with participants dressing up in masks and fancy dress outfits. The holy day commemorates the salvation of the Jewish people in ancient Persia during the 5th century BC when Royal adviser Haman plotted 'to destroy, kill and annihilate all the Jews, young and old, infants and women, in a single day'. The ancient story is recorded in the book of Esther in the Hebrew Bible and tells how a royal adviser to King Ahasuerus - presumed to be Xerxes I of Persia - called Haman planned to kill all the Jews in the empire. But his plans were foiled by Mordecai and his adopted daughter Queen Esther. Huge celebrations are held around the world and Orthodox children - from Stamford Hill to Tel Aviv - donned fancy dress outfits, ranging from penguins to cowboys to musketeers. Purim is celebrated annually on the 14th day of the Hebrew month of Adar - the day following the victory over the plot. It is the one day of the year where Jewish people are encouraged to get 'shikker' - a Yiddish term for extremely drunk - and to eat, drink and be merry. Drunkenness is usually discouraged by Jewish law but it is considered a mitzvah - religious duty - to drink alcohol on Purim although followers are still expected to perform all other duties of the festival. As well as parades and fancy dress, Purim is celebrated by the giving of food and drink to other Jews and through charity to the poor. In Tel Aviv the gay community wore elaborate costumes, including a couple dressed as Israeli soldiers and one man dressed as a Persian princess.

The Mexican fisherman who claims to have survived more than a year at sea has flown into Mexico to meet the family of his dead shipmate. José Salvador Alvarenga, 37, was discovered in January this year, 14 months after setting sail with 23-year-old Ezekiel Cordoba Rios. Just four months into the trip, young Rios became ill after drinking turtle's blood to survive, and died. Scroll down for video . Survivor: Still-injured José Salvador Alvarenga, 37, was supported by his mother as he limped into Chiapas where he will meet the family of his shipmate Ezekiel Cordoba Rios, 23, who died at sea . From the airport, he drove to Costa Azul, where the family live. He said he will pass on Ezekiel's dying message and answer questions about their months adrift after the engine on their wooden fishing boat broke . On Friday, the Salvadoran fisherman landed in Mexico City with his parents and lawyer, before catching another plane to Chiapas, where his journey started in December 2012. 'I feel like a hero,' Alvarenga told press as he limped through Chiapas Airport, still recovering from his injuries sustained at sea. 'I don't feel capable yet of telling what I remember. 'When I talk about that day, I feel like I am back there in the moment when I was suffering and hurting... what I am trying to do is to forget that. Ezekiel Cordoba Rios (pictured left) died four months into their exile at sea in a 24ft wooden boat (right) Their engine broke and bad weather sent them 6,500 miles into the Pacific Ocean where they were stranded . Survivor: Alvarenga was far more articulate on Friday than when he first spoke to journalists. Plans are now under way for a book deal or movie to be made of his life . He called Nicolas Cordoba Cruz, Ezekiel's father, in February but today will meet him to answer his questions . Asked about his time with Rios, he said: 'There was nothing we could do except cry and suffer.' The . so-called Miracle Man Of The Pacific is now en route to Costa Azul, the . coastal town where Ezekiel's father, mother and three brothers live. It . has emerged Alvarenga phoned his companion's father, Nicolas Cordoba . Cruz, on February 7 for an initial conversation, and passed on part of . his companion's dying message. Alvarenga, who flew in with his parents and lawyer, said he will struggle to discuss those months . 'Ezekiel . told him [Alvarenga] to tell his brothers to look after their mother . and to tell me that he was going to be fine,' Cordoba Cruz told the El . Paso Times, clutching the only two pictures he has of his son. But, he added, there is much more to discuss in person: 'He . asked me for forgiveness because he could not do anything for . Ezequiel. 'Maybe authorities think that it is enough to have an explanation of what happened over the phone. 'But that doesn't hurt as much as the pain I feel of knowing I will not see my son again.' When he emerged on January 30, 2014, Alvarenga told media his companion died just four months into the trip. 'My friend,' he said in an interview, 'tried to drink the blood of turtles but he kept being sick because it disagreed with his stomach.' Eventually Ezekiel died, Alvarenga said, and he had to lower the body overboard. They had drifted 6,500 miles from Mexico into the Pacific Ocean, thrown off course by bad weather. Despite emerging from the fishing boat with bleached hair, sunburn, and bloating, Alvarenga was deemed to be in strikingly good health by doctors - though mentally frail. Ezekiel, his three brothers and his parents lived in Mexican border town Juarez until early 2012 when they moved to the seaside village of Chiapas to escape the town's gang culture. There, the young fisherman met Alvarenga and months later they were missing. Alvarenga's mother Maria Julia cupped his chin as he spoke to journalists yesterday in Mexico . Alvarenga emerged in January bloated, sun-scorched and frail after drifting 6,500 miles from Mexico . Five days after Cordoba Rios failed to return from his shark-fishing trip with Alvarenga, the family in Chiapas reported him missing and began searching for him, his aunt Lucia Cordoba Cruz said. 'Our family looked for him in the sea, in other villages, always hoping to find him,' she said, adding that their search ended about three weeks later in December 2012. But his father, who had been sick and had several surgeries, was not told about his son's disappearance for several more months. 'I thought the boat had sunk in the open sea,' he said. Plans are now under way for a book or movie to be made about the ordeal.","José Salvador Alvarenga and Ezekiel Cordoba Rios set sail December 2012 .

Hundreds of women breastfed on the street in support of a woman who was branded a 'tramp' for feeding her baby in public. Emily Slough, 27, was photographed on the steps of a restaurant last Friday feeding her eight-month-old Matilda. The anonymous photographer posted the image on Facebook, writing: 'I know the sun is out n all that but there's no need to let your kid feast on your nipple in town!!! Tramp.' Protest: Between 600 and 1,000 women turned out in Rugeley, Staffordshire, to breastfeed today . They sat on the street outside The Shrew pub where Emily Slough, 27, was first pictured last Friday . Today, women across the country gathered in town centres to campaign for the right to breastfeed in public. One protest, organised by Mrs Slough in Rugeley, Staffordshire, featured between 600 and 1,000 demonstrators who crowded around The Shrew pub - where she was spotted last week. In Newcastle, more than 50 mothers sat on the pavement with their infant children, discussing the issue with passers-by. Janet Murphy, 32, who co-organised the Newcastle gathering, said: 'This woman was labelled a tramp on a social networking site and we're here to try and make everyone aware that it's ok, normal and natural for a woman to breast feed wherever she wishes to. 'If someone criticized me, I'd tell them . it's acceptable to do it in public. Animals do it. Breasts aren't a . sexual thing they're for feeding your child.' Ms Slough was pictured feeding eight-month-old Matilda out shopping, then was branded a tramp on Facebook . She organised the event in Rugeley and urged passers-by to consider the right to feed children anywhere . The image and caption, branding Ms Slough a 'tramp', sparking national outrage, with protests across the UK . Julia Langley added: 'I think I'd be absolutely gutted if someone did that to me, I mean this photo was taken without her consent, she didn't know it had been taken. 'I think that things like this can really put off new mums who are thinking of how they're going to feed their baby if they get treated like this for breast feeding in public, it might sway their decision towards bottle feeding instead.' Treasure Chest, York's leading breastfeeding support group, also came out in support of the protests. Katherine Odom, Chair of the group said: 'Many mums can feel that breastfeeding their child in public is a barrier for them and we hope this lone incident doesn't put mums or prospective mums off breastfeeding when there are so many benefits for both mum and baby. In Newcastle, more than 50 mothers got on their knees to block the town centre while breastfeeding . Support: They were supported by breastfeeding support group Treasure Chest, whose chair said mothers feel under-pressure and embarrassed to carry out everyday essential duties . One mother, Julia Langley, said the 'taboo' of breastfeeding could push women into less natural bottle feeding . 'There are many organisations like Treasure Chest, who can support women in their breastfeeding goals. Breastfeeding in public without harassment is a right every woman should have - in fact it is protected by law in the Equality Act of 2010 - and we can give practical tips and friendly support to help mums overcome any reservations they may have.'

Mrs Slough, from Rugeley, Staffordshire, said she was 'shocked' when she discovered what had been said about her. She told the Birmingham Mail: 'The mentality of the individual that attempted to shame me for feeding my daughter makes me so angry. 'I am very confident and comfortable with my breastfeeding, but I know plenty who aren't and don't even humour the idea of nursing because of some ridiculous stigma attached to it and fear of embarrassment, humiliation and non-acceptance.'","More than 600 women gathered to fight for the right to breastfeed in public .

Diane Bakuraira, 33, was just 10 years old when she first began to develop feelings for her female classmates. But when, years later, Diane plucked up the courage to tell her mother about her sexuality, the response was worse than she could ever have imagined. 'I am still struggling to make her . understand me,' explains the Ugandan human rights activist, 'but it is still very hard. At one point, she called the police to come and arrest me and she has said she wants to disown me. Fear: Diane Bakuraira says she is living in terror of her life following the enaction of Uganda's anti-gay law . She adds: 'My mother has met most of my gay friends but when she did, she sternly accused them of ""spoiling"" me.' Diane is one of an estimated 500,000 gay people in Uganda; a country where homophobia is so entrenched, the government introduced a bill which punishes homosexuals with sentences that range from 14 years for 'first time offenders' to life in prison. Those who aren't thrown into prison are forced to live with a daily barrage of abuse and risk being 'outed' by local tabloid Red Pepper; a paper notorious for such headlines as: City Tycoons Who Bankroll Ugandan Homos Revealed and Straight By Day, Gay By Night. In the wake of President Museveni's signing of the anti-gay bill last month, the paper celebrated with the headline: Exposed! Uganda's 200 Top Homos Named; a stunt that led to backers, phone company Orange among them, pulling their ads. 'I got fired from work because the Red Pepper ran a story that claimed I was a famous female DJâ€™s girlfriend,' reveals Diane. Shocking: Ugandan tabloid Red Pepper ran a story entitled: Exposed: Uganda's Top 200 Homos . Angry: Diane has been attacked in the Red Pepper newspaper and lost her job because of it . Speaking to MailOnline via email for fear that her phone has been tapped by Government agents, she adds: 'I get so angry and scared for the people being named because the stories put us at risk of mob violence. '[The Red Pepper] puts them in terrible danger, from their family, landlords . and bosses. I know four lesbians who have been evicted by their landlords because of Red Pepper and some of my friends have been disowned.' Shocking though it might sound, being disowned is the last of their worries as Diane explains. 'The police have been to my . house after someone told them that I am a lesbian and that I was dealing drugs,' she reveals. 'I'm currently looking for a new house because last week, someone slipped an anonymous note under the door that said ""tetwagala bisiyaga wano"" (we don't want homosexuals here) and I'm scared of what might happen.' And it's not just at home. On the street, Diane runs a daily gauntlet of ridicule, verbal abuse and even violence at the hands of fellow Ugandans. 'Being a lesbian in Uganda is like being a tourist who walks past a hungry old lion in Tsavo National Park [in Kenya],' she explains. 'It's hard because you're either forced to live a lie all your life or be open about it and then deal with slaps and ridicule at malls and other places. Some of us are even subjected to corrective rape . by our families.' But it's the new anti-gay bill and the harsh penalties attached that are currently causing her the most worry. Hate: A demonstration against gay people in the Ugandan capital Kampala ahead of the Anti-Homosexuality Bill . Shocking: A headline in Ugandan tabloid Rolling Stone which regularly publishes the names of gay citizens . Uganda's Red Pepper tabloid is notorious for its anti-gay stance and inflammatory headlines. Lowlights include the recent naming of 200 alleged homosexuals following the passage of the anti-gay bill through Uganda's parliament and wild claims that 'homo generals' were responsible for a pair of Al Shabaab bomb blasts in Kampala in 2010. The paper is owned by General Salim Saleh; the younger brother of President Museveni and a man currently wanted in connection with alleged war crimes by prosecutors at the Hague. Despite, or perhaps because of, its eye-catching headlines, Red Pepper is one of the country's most popular papers and has been joined by a second tabloid, Rolling Stone, which is just as virulent.

Although the bill that finally emerged last month didn't specify, as feared, the death penalty for homosexuals, Diane says the alternative of life in prison is little better.

'I . am worried day and night about what might happen but what worries me most is how many innocent lives are at risk, all because they happened to fall in love with the wrong person.' And she's not the only one terrified about what could happen next. Many of her gay friends, says Diane, have gone into hiding in terror for their lives. 'People are saying . the law has just stopped them from doing anything,' she reveals. 'Some have stood their . ground but others, even those who used to take part in rallies, have gone back into hiding.'

Demonstration: Gay rights activists protest outside the Ugandan High Commission in London last month . She also hopes that the international community will consider cutting aid to Uganda but says it shouldn't be because of the anti-gay bill but because of the endemic corruption that exists in the country. 'I donâ€™t think aid should be cut because of the new law; . they should cut it because of the corruption and . misappropriation of donor funds meant for projects intended to benefit ordinary people, including the LGBT community. 'Human Rights are . being violated in this country so yes sanctions should be imposed.' Despite the risks of remaining, Diane says she has no intention of moving abroad and is desperate to stay and fight for her rights. 'I . hope that, with time, we will be accepted for who we are . and won't be treated like second class citizens or outcasts. 'But,' she adds, 'I am a Ugandan so leaving has never been an option because this is my country and I belong here.

Passed into law on 24th February 2014, Uganda's anti-homosexuality act criminalises same sex relations with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment attached. It also includes a clause that makes it illegal for Ugandans to enter into gay relationships outside the country and calls on other nations to allow extradition of gay citizens to Uganda to face courts there. Also covered in the bill are media organisations, NGOs, individuals or companies that know of LGBT people and do nothing, or support gay rights. Originally drafted with the death penalty as the maximum sentence, the bill swiftly became known as the 'Kill the Gays Bill' in the local media. Since the act came into force, several nations have suspended aid to Uganda, among them Norway, Denmark and the Netherlands.","Diane Bakuraira, 33, lives in Uganda and knew she was gay at the age of 10 .

FRENCH president Francois Hollande is on the verge of dumping his latest mistress Julie Gayet and has been spending more time with the mother of his children, it has been claimed. Closer magazine, which broke news of the relationship in January, sparking a global scandal, is running a story with the headline: 'It smells like the end.' It says Mr Hollande, a 59-year-old father of four who has never been married, is becoming increasingly uncomfortable with Ms Gayet, a 41-year-old actress with whom he has allegedly had a two-year affair. French President Francois Hollande is reportedly seeing less of actress Julie Gayet - and more of his first partner and the mother of his children, Segolene Royal . Pictures published two months ago showed Mr Hollande wearing a crash helmet as he travelled to and from their central Paris love nest on the back of a moped. It led to Mr Hollande's live-in-lover, Valerie Trierweiler, 49, losing her job as France's first lady and being kicked out of the Elysee Palace. Now, according to Closer, Mr Hollande is seeing more of Segolene Royal, the 60-year-old Socialist politician he dated for more than 20 years and with whom he has four children. Julie Gayet (left) has been questioning Mr Hollande about his relationship with Segolene Royal . The magazine points to how Mr Hollande is now 'all smiles and feels free since the clarification of his relationship with Valerie Trierweiler'. It notes how Ms Gayet has been promoting her career alone, recently going solo to the French Oscars, where she was nominated for supporting actress award. But, the magazine adds, 'Since Closer Gate, the President and the actress have exchanged a lot of texts about the return of Segolene Royal into the life of Francois Hollande, and perhaps this is a brake on their relationship? 'Worried about the well-being of Valerie Trierweiler, wounded by their separation, is Francois Hollande looking to be with' Ms Royal? Valerie Trierweiler moved out of the Elysee Palace after Mr Hollande's affair with Julie Gayet became public . Last week, Ms Gayet claimed more than Â£40,000 in damages from Closer for allegedly breaching her right to privacy by revealing her affair with Mr Hollande. The revelations caused an international scandal and left Ms Trierweiler in hospital for more than a week. But Closer defended its reporting, saying that that the secret tryst threatened Mr Hollande's security, and was being carried out using taxpayers' money. The secret affair also reduced the position of French first lady to a farce, as Ms Trierweiler was carrying out functions while not being Mr Hollande's main partner. Closer editor Laurence Pieau said his magazine had published information which had been discussed openly at 'dinner parties' and even 'in television studios'. 'We did our duty as journalists in giving exact information that the public had a right to know', she said.

Eric Pickles revealed the Tories are now looking at setting down 'minimum standards', making it more difficult for local authorities to offer fortnightly collections . Eric Pickles has threatened to introduce new laws forcing councils to bring back weekly bin collections after admitting the Government’s previous efforts have done no more than slow the decline. The Communities Secretary said it had taken Labour ten years to ‘destroy’ the traditional weekly service and suggested it would take as long to restore it. He revealed the Tories are now looking at setting down ‘minimum standards’, making it more difficult for local authorities to offer fortnightly collections. Councils should also be forced to publicise when long-running  contracts with waste firms are up for renewal, giving voters a chance  to demand a return to a weekly service, he said. Admitting his frustration at the lack of progress so far, Mr Pickles told the Daily Mail: ‘If people get impatient with me, so be it. They aren’t as impatient as I am.’ The minister, who argues weekly rubbish collections are a ‘fundamental right’, has been under increasing pressure over his repeated pledges before the election to reverse the trend towards a fortnightly service that began under Labour. But the proportion of councils operating black bag collections every other week has increased from 57 per cent in 2010 to 69 per cent last year. Most councils have shunned a £250million fund set up by Mr Pickles to pay for the reintroduction of weekly services. Instead, the cash has been used to support the retention of weekly services in areas which still offer them. Mr Pickles’ Department for Communities and Local Government only has authority over councils in England, where it says its efforts have slowed down the movement towards fortnightly bin collections. Mr Pickles insisted the Government had safeguarded weekly collections for six million households in England. File picture . In parts of Scotland and Wales, where the department has no say, some councils are even considering collecting black bag rubbish only once every three weeks. Mr Pickles insisted the Government had safeguarded weekly collections for six million households in England, with four million more still getting them from councils outside the scheme. He said he had also abolished plans for new bin taxes and changed the law to scrap unfair fines for people who do not put  rubbish out correctly. ‘If we hadn’t done what we have, we would have virtually no weekly  collections. We’ve certainly saved six million, but it’s a process,’ the minister said. ‘It was always going to be very difficult to take on the bin barons, take on the industry and stand up for what ordinary punters want.’ Mr Pickles said he wanted to amend Labour’s Household Waste Recycling Act 2003 to include the minimum standards. ‘It would make it more difficult to do fortnightly collections and set out the type of collection that had to be made weekly,’ he added.","Conservatives want to make it difficult to provide fortnightly collections .

The controversial government-backed Help to Buy scheme is to be extended until the end of the decade and the first new garden city for 100 years is to be built in an attempt to boost housebuilding. Chancellor George Osborne revealed yesterday that both measures will be in this week’s Budget, adding that Britain needed to ‘get building’ to secure the economic recovery. The extension of Help to Buy for new properties – which had been due to end in 2016 – to 2020 will support the construction of 120,000 additional homes, he said. The move comes despite suggestions that the Help to Buy scheme could be overheating the housing market, with Bank of England governor Mark Carney keeping a ‘close eye’ on the scheme. Under Help to Buy, the Government lends a prospective home buyer up to 20 per cent of the cost of their new-build home so a buyer needs only a 5 per cent cash deposit and a 75 per cent mortgage to make up the rest. The Chancellor also announced that a garden city will be built at Ebbsfleet in Kent, which will initially provide 15,000 homes. The Chancellor said Britain needs to 'get building' despite Mark Carney warning the scheme is dangerous . Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: ‘We’ve got the lowest level of house-building since the 20s. ‘The Government is not doing enough to invest in affordable homes and the economics of this is if you boost demand with Help to Buy and don’t do enough on supply, the price goes up (and) it’s harder to get into the housing market. ‘If George Osborne really wants to make a difference he would have been much more radical on house-building in the last three years and today – and he’s not been. It’s a damp squib.’ The Local Government Association, which represents almost 400 councils in England and Wales, expressed alarm at the Chancellor’s plans. Chairman Sir Merrick Cockell said: ‘Democratically accountable councils have been at the forefront of delivering local growth and the creation of a separate, remote quango is unnecessary.’ Ed Balls yesterday dumped Labour’s promises to cut VAT and reverse child benefit cuts. The . shadow Chancellor confirmed that a £12billion plan at the centre of the . opposition’s ‘plan for jobs and growth’ – a reduction in VAT to 17.5 . per cent – had been abandoned. And a pledge to restore child benefit to the better-off could also no longer be a ‘priority’. Instead . Labour would use the proceeds of new taxes on banks and bankers’ bonuses – which the Conservatives accuse them of spending ten times over . on different projects – to fund a ‘jobs guarantee’ for the young . unemployed. Ed Balls blasted Osborne's plans while revealing Labour will not prioritise reversing child benefit cuts . Mr Balls also again refused to apologise for Labour’s economic record – denying the last government spent too much money. ‘There was a global financial crisis,’ he said. ‘At . that point, we had the lowest level of national debt of any big country . and George Osborne, the Conservative shadow Chancellor, had matched . Labour’s level of public spending. ‘Am . I going to apologise for the level of public spending that George . Osborne, Alistair Darling and Gordon Brown agreed on in 2007?

Pressure: George Obsorne has been encouraged to raise to threshold for the 40 per cent tax rate by members of his own party . Pressure is mounting on George Osborne to raise the 40p tax threshold – after he reportedly said that people did not mind paying the higher rate because it made them feel like a 'success'. The row over the millions of workers being dragged into paying the higher rate of tax threatens to overshadow this week’s Budget, with a string of senior Tories expressing concern. Business leaders also weighed in yesterday, with the Institute of Directors saying the system was ‘highly damaging to UK plc’. But the Chancellor is expected to reject their pleas – instead using the Budget to again raise the threshold for basic rate income tax to £10,500. Yesterday the Chancellor faced extraordinary claims that he told a private meeting of Tory MPs there were ‘advantages’ for the party that more people were being pulled into paying the higher rate. ‘It means they feel they are a success and joining the aspirational classes,’ he was said to have told them. ‘That means they are more likely to think like Conservatives and vote Conservative. If they are paying 40p tax they have a greater interest in cutting government spending because they are paying for it.’ A Treasury source insisted: ‘George did not say people enjoy paying 40p. He was explaining that even though more people are paying a marginal tax rate of 40 per cent, the important thing is that they are paying less tax overall.’ But two MPs from the Conservatives’ 1922 backbench committee who were present at the meeting in Downing Street last month said the account of the meeting was accurate. One said: ‘He did say it made people feel they were a success. There was a sense of dumbfounded shock around the table.’ Since the election, 1.4million workers have been dragged into the 40p tax band, which kicks in at £41,450. There are 4.4 million people paying the higher rate, up from 3.02million when the Coalition came to power and 1.35million in 1988. Senior Tories, including two former Chancellors and London Mayor Boris Johnson, have urged Mr Osborne to indicate he wants to use further  budgets to ease the 40p squeeze on middle-class professionals. Urged: Boris Johnson, right, has previously encouraged the Chancellor to act over tax . A survey of firms by the Institute of Directors identified growing concern over the number of families paying the tax. It found an increase in the higher-rate threshold to £50,000 had emerged as their top priority for personal taxation and warned the current system was damaging the country. The Chancellor said yesterday that anyone earning up to £100,000 was better off thanks to the Government’s dramatic increases in the personal allowance. ‘It helps people whether they’re earning £20,000 or £50,000. It’s only people right at the top, people on incomes of over £100,000, who don’t get the benefit,’ he said. Mr Osborne said he was ‘incredibly proud’ of what the Conservatives had done to raise the personal allowance, mainly helping basic-rate taxpayers – who are better off by more than £700 a year as a result. Intervention: Former Chancellor Lord Lamont said Mr Osborne 'can't go on forever' without raising the threshold . ‘This has been an income tax cut for 25million people. It’s taken the lowest-paid two million out of tax. ‘And the benefits have been felt by those on the higher incomes, on the higher threshold – those earning £40,000, £50,000, £60,000 – so I think that is a misconception in this debate,’ he said. The Chancellor hinted that he might look at action on the 40p threshold if the Conservatives won a majority in next year’s election. Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors, said: ‘What was intended as a tax to hit the very wealthiest has now entrapped millions of hard-working people. ‘Aspirational middle-earners now suffer an income tax rate of 40 per cent, plus 2 per cent National Insurance, before their incomes exceed even twice median earnings. ‘This is a completely unacceptable situation. It represents a disincentive for aspiring junior managers and professionals to accept promotions or move jobs and, accordingly, it is highly damaging to UK plc.’ Former Tory Chancellor Lord Lamont said: ‘You can’t go on for ever and for ever increasing the personal allowance and not increasing the 40 per cent tax threshold, because you’re just driving more and more people into that band. ‘It also is a very, very expensive policy because in order to keep the number of people not paying tax constant, you have to keep adjusting it and adjusting it each year. ‘When the 40p rate was introduced by Nigel Lawson, it applied to one in 20 people. It now applies to one in six people and by 2015 next year, there’ll be 6million people paying this.’","Boris Johnson and two former Chancellors have intervened in tax row .

A team of women in the beer industry have been manufacturing more subtle flavours to attract female drinkers . Beer is increasingly replacing wine for women amid successful efforts to introduce brews with sophisticated and subtle flavours. The campaign for real ale (CAMRA) has some 20,000 female members, while a new generation of women ‘brewsters’ are creating successful craft ales. In fact, there is evidence dating back to thousands of years before Christ was born to show women were the first and most respected of brewers. Now a group of women at the top of Britain’s burgeoning brewery industry have developed a range of seven beers designed to appeal particularly to women, but also men. The Revisionist Beer range consists of 'old world’ continental beer styles, such as Belgian Saison and a German wheat beer, to ‘new world’ beer flavours like an American Rye Pale Ale, a Californian Common Steam beer and a Red Ale. The beers are being produced by the leading independent brewery Marstons with the help of the head of its supply chain Emma Gilleland, who is now perhaps the single most influential brewer in the UK, presiding over 60 ales across five breweries. Marston’s 28-year-old brewmaster, Genevieve Upton, worked with Emma on the Revisionist range and created one of the beers herself - a California Common Steam beer. Genevieve said: ‘I’d love to see beer become even more popular amongst women. ‘More people need to start recognising beer alongside wines with respect to food matching and breadth of flavours and character. ‘I am passionate about getting more information and knowledge to the consumer about the magic of the brewing process, the magical flavours of ingredients and the heritage behind some of the country’s oldest and most classic beers.’ Traditionally, women have been the target of the wine market, with men the faithful beer drinkers . The other women behind the new range all come from Tesco’s beer team and include ale buyer Chiara Nesbitt, world beers buyer Olivia Christou and beer technical advisor Danielle Jack. Chiara, aged 30, who is responsible for sourcing a range of nearly 600 ales for the chain, said: ‘Whisper it softly but there is a quiet revolution taking place in the beer world and women are playing a part in it. ‘Tastes are changing and a new breed of . drinker is emerging who is looking for beers with different flavours and . strong character in much the same way that we approach wine. ‘Increasing numbers of women are enjoying beer these days - and in particular lighter, refreshing brews - so it’s natural that many are now entering the beer industry and are helping influence current trends.’ Clay tablets suggest that in ancient Mesopotamia, which is considered the cradle of civilisation, the majority of brewers were probably women. This group were given special status in society, supposedly receiving divine protection from female gods. Roger Protz of CAMRA said: ‘It is only in modern times that men have overtaken women as the main brewers of beer, as historically it was women who dominated brewing. ‘Traditionally known as ‘brewsters’, it is fantastic to see more women rejoining the industry and in many cases giving the chaps a run for their money.’ One female owned and run brewery making a name for themselves nationally is the award winning Mallinson’s brewery. Founded by CAMRA members Tara Mallinson and Elaine Yendall at a small six barrel plant in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, in 2008, they moved to a larger 15 barrel site in 2012 to help meet the growing demand. Tara said: ‘Brewing real ale is a great job, you get to experiment with new hops, rebrew old favourites and hopefully give the people who drink your beer a great pint.’ The new range will be sold in Wetherspoons pubs and Tesco stores.","Campaign for real ale (CAMRA) has 20,000 female members and growing .

George Osborne’s fashionable 5:2 diet appears to be paying off, with the Chancellor looking noticeably leaner on the breakfast TV sofa yesterday. The Chancellor is said to have shed significant amounts of weight by cutting his calorie intake to just 500 on two days of the week - while David Cameron has sparked speculation he may also be on a new diet. The Prime Minister, who has fought an on-off battle with his weight, tucked into low-fat options on his flight back from a trip to Tel Aviv last week, after Number 10 asked for him to be served a selection containing no dairy products. Squeezed middle? Osborne appeared slimmed down at the BBC yesterday, compared to jogging in 2013 (right) Mr Cameron is also said to be experimenting with alternatives to standard milk, such as almond milk, which is low in calories and fat. Downing Street said it never commented on the Prime Minister’s dietary habits. The PM is not thought to be on a full dairy-free diet. But the revelations will spark speculation about whether Mr Cameron has decided to cut back on dairy products as part of a drive to lose weight ahead of next year’s election. Mr Cameron’s efforts to keep in trim have been hampered by a knee injury, which has curtailed his jogging. He looked far from svelte when he was pictured eating a Byron burger to get through the spending review . On the Andrew Marr Show, however, the Chancellor cut a lean figure after cutting his calorie intake twice a week . Although he has been able to take up the activity again recently, it is still only at a relatively low level. Aides said he had been ‘pounding the streets’ in Jerusalem last week, but sources later revealed his activity had been confined to a short 10-minute jog. The Prime Minister has spoken several times about his battle with middle-age spread. In an interview with Now magazine in 2012 he was asked about his New Year’s resolutions and replied: ‘Probably to lose a bit of weight, I think. That’s the key one for me.’ But last summer he was photographed looking portly and sunburned on a beach while on holiday in Cornwall. At the Conservative Party conference in October he joked that the unflattering photos of him wearing only a Mickey Mouse towel did at least demonstrate he had the ‘stomach for the fight’. David Cameron, who has filled out since taking office in 2010, is said to be trying out dairy alternatives . In an interview in January this year the Prime Minister described himself as a ‘middle-aged, slightly overweight man’. He said he tried to go jogging once or twice a week in parks near Downing Street, and was rarely recognised. ‘The thing about the parks in London is its mostly full of tourists who just see some middle-aged slightly overweight man trotting past them and they just think it’s another one,’ he said. Flight records from last week confirm that a special diet was requested for Mr Cameron on his trip to Israel and Palestine. He was listed as the flight’s ‘VVIP’, with a note to say he should be served ‘non-dairy’ meals. Trending: Education Secretary Michael Gove lost two stone at a £2,500 Austrian 'fat farm' retreat . His main meal on the five-hour flight from Tel Aviv to London was salmon served with salad. He was also served with a snack of tacos with chicken and vegetables. Asked about the meal selection, a Downing Street spokesman said he had ‘no comment’ to make. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, meanwhile, has taken up kickboxing in a bid to get fit and slim down for the general election, and it emerged that the Education Secretary Michael Gove spent a week at an Austrian ‘fat farm’ popular with celebrities. The £2,500 stay is said to have helped him shed two stone.","Osborne slimmed after cutting calorie intake to 500 for two days a week .

Town centres face a summer of booze-fuelled violence if David Cameron’s plans to relax drinking rules during the World Cup go ahead, police and town halls are warning. The Prime Minister is set to approve rules allowing every single one of the country’s 120,000 pubs and bars to open late on the evenings of England’s matches in Brazil this summer. Drinking hours would be extended as late as 1am for at least the three group matches in June. But the proposals, published last week, have caused disquiet among police, councils and residents groups who will be left powerless to stop late opening even in pubs with a history of violence. Police and councils are alarmed that every single one of the country¿s 120,000 pubs and bars will be allowed to open late on the evenings of England¿s matches in Brazil this summer. File picture . Last night, council chiefs told the Daily Mail the move would lead to ‘significant disturbance’ on the streets with local authorities left to ‘clear up the consequences’. Until last month, the Home Office was set to allow controls on extended opening to rest with town halls. But this was set aside after a personal intervention from the Prime Minister. Mr Cameron wants to invoke a little-used power available for ‘significant national events’ to allow a blanket extension of opening hours across the country. The power was used for the Royal Wedding 2011 and the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee in 2012 but has never before been used for a major sporting tournament. Downing Street’s intervention has caused disquiet in the Home Office, where there are fears it could unleash a wave of street violence. Drinking hours would be extended as late as 1am for at least England's group matches in June . Last night, the Local Government Association, which represents councils in England and Wales, said the issue of which pubs can open late should be ‘determined locally’. A spokesman said: ‘Councils will always seek to say yes to well-run businesses who have proven that they can cater effectively for selling alcohol at events where emotions run high. ‘They also, however, have a responsibility to residents who live near popular venues and may be exposed to significant disturbance as a result. ‘Local councils and partners such as the police are best placed to consider these issues and reach decisions on how long local premises should stay open, whereas a blanket national extension fails to take local circumstances into account at all.’ Official Home Office documents point out that using the power during the World Cup could lead to ‘alcohol-related crime and disorder, public nuisance and risks to public safety.’ The alternative, which is backed by councils, would be for pubs and bars which wanted to stay open until late to apply for a temporary licence in the normal way. This would give residents their say and allow councils to keep control of late-night drinking in town and city centres. Police point to sharp increases in violence and arrests during major football tournaments. In 2012 more than 152 arrests were made during the opening games of the tournament, with most on England match days. Tony Hogg, the Police and Crime Commissioner for Devon and Cornwall said: ‘I believe these decisions should be left in local hands, where local factors can be taken into account and suitable measures put in place in liaison with experienced local advice. ‘This is not about stopping people having fun and enjoying the football.

Cllr Susan Hall, leader of Harrow Council, said: ‘Everyone will enjoy a drink during the World Cup and big screen viewing in pubs is clearly going to be a big draw. ‘But that shouldn’t be a licence for known problem pubs that routinely give the police and councils issues to stay open simply by wrapping themselves in the St George flag. ‘Councils and the police should have the determining voice on what stays open locally as we have the local knowledge. ‘The era of extended licensing has in many cases proven to be more wild west saloon than the continental café society that proponents claimed. And, as ever, local authorities are left to clear up the consequences.’ Alcohol campaigners suggested the PM had caved to ‘alcohol industry pressure’. Tom Smith, Policy Manager at Alcohol Concern said: ‘The Government once again seem poised to cave into alcohol industry pressure and rather than letting local areas decide on whether to extend pub opening hours for the World Cup, are intent on forcing this through from on high. ‘We think this should be up to local councils with residents who know their areas and where any potential trouble might arise. ‘The pressure from advertising during football World Cups to drink alcohol can be immense but we’d like to directly challenge the notion that watching football has to go hand in hand with drinking. Sport should be a celebration of fitness and health which is not compatible with excessive drinking.’ ‘Rather than act as the nation’s landlord in setting pub hours, we’d like the Prime Minister to show leadership on alcohol policy and to start by listening to the views of local residents, police, A&E staff rather than big business.’ Under the original Home Office plans councils any pub or bar could apply to their local authority for longer opening hours. But at the beginning of last month, Mr Cameron overruled Liberal Democrat Crime Minister Norman Baker and said he had ‘ordered a re-think’. It followed lobbying by the British Beer and Pub Association which argued for longer opening hours across the board. If the PM’s proposal is implemented it will mean all pubs can remain open until 1am for all three group games, against Italy at 11pm on June 14, Uruguay at 8pm on June 19 and Costa Rica at 5pm on June 24 - and any knockout stage matches. All knock-out stage games kick-off at 9pm apart from the final, which will be played at 8pm on July 13 in Rio de Janeiro. Mr Cameron’s intervention was welcomed by the British Beer and Pub Association. Its chief executive Brigid Simmonds said at the time it would be ‘fantastic news’ for millions of football fans. At the time the Prime Minister’s spokesman said: ‘It is right that we consult but, subject to that consultation, clearly our intention would be that pubs would be able to be open for the relevant games, reflecting the fact that it is a major national event.’","Drinking hours will be extended to as late as 1am for England matches .

Researchers at University College London found it is natural for people to bump into lamp posts if they aren't looking directly at them . Scientists have shed light on why it is so easy to bump into a lamppost despite carefully walking along a busy street. They have found that when we concentrate hard on looking at some things, others appear dimmer, just as if the light has been turned down on them. This, they say, explains why sometimes we look but donâ€™t see. The University College London researchers asked a group of volunteers to remember where squares of different colours flashed up on a screen. Sometimes, they just had to memorise one square, other times, it was much harder, with six squares. They were also asked a question about a black and white pattern that was also on the screen. When the task involving the coloured squares was easy, they got the question right 95 per cent of the time. But when it was difficult, accuracy dropped to 64 per cent. Altering the contrast of the black and white pattern throughout the experiment, revealed that 50 per cent more contrast was needed for the volunteers to see it as clearly when doing the hard task. In other words, it appeared dimmer. Researcher Nilli Lavie, said this could help explain why when we are looking hard at one thing â€“ such as how to dodge people walking down a busy street â€“ we miss something right in front of our eyes, such as a lamppost. We can lose our footing by accidentally focusing on distant objects rather than nearby obstructions . The knowledge, detailed in the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, could also help make jobs that involve processing a lot of visual information safer. This includes pilots, who have to watch numerous dials and instruments, and surgeons, who are at risk of information overload while carrying out complex operations.","University College London researchers found we often look but don't see .

Milestone: Britain has now reached a major milestone in the drawdown from Afghanistan as it works towards withdrawing all combat troops by the end of the year .

Above, soldiers clean their weapons at Camp Bastion . Dismantling: One of the bases to be dismantled was Main Operating Base Price, which was shut down yesterday. Above, Brigadier Woodham poses at Camp Bastion . He said he had . seen huge progress in central Helmand since his last tour of duty in . 2009/10, which gave him 'hope for the future' - adding: 'It is really difficult . for people in the UK to understand the changes. 'They are really proud of the progress they have made, I just . wish we could capture that and take that back to the UK, but I have seen . it through my eyes and it is really powerful stuff.' He said he had particularly noticed a difference in Nade-e Ali, which had been . transformed from 'a warzone' into somewhere now 'primarily . peaceful'. And when asked if the sacrifice of the 448 British lives had been worth it, he said: 'It is always a difficult question to ask when there has been a . human cost here in central Helmand. Successful operation: Defence Secretary Philip Hammond (pictured) said the handover and closure of UK bases across Helmand 'underlines the progress UK Forces have made to increase security and stability across the province' 'I guess ultimately history will judge the worth of what we've been doing at our Government's request here.' Two of the bases handed over to Afghan control in recent weeks include Main . Operating Base (MOB) Lashkar Gah - the former headquarters of UK . military forces in Afghanistan - and Patrol Base (PB) Lashkar Gah Durai. And Camp Bastion itself - the main military headquarters of British forces in Afghanistan - is expected to be shut down by the end of the year. The handovers are the latest milestones in a drawdown that has seen UK bases reduce from 137 at the height of the campaign, while Afghan forces are now leading 97 per cent of all security operations across the country and carrying out over 90 per cent of their own training. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: 'The handover and closure of our bases across Helmand underlines the progress UK Forces have made to increase security and stability across the province but also to build up the capability of the Afghan forces who will carry that work forward. 'Those service personnel who have served in Lashkar Gah and Lashkar Gah Durai and at MOB Price as part of successive UK brigades have made a huge contribution to the campaign which has safeguarded our national security at home. 'UK combat operations will cease by the end of this year but our support for the Afghan people will continue. Meanwhile, our troops will continue the mammoth task of getting our people and equipment home by Christmas.' Britain's main base at Lashkar Gah, which opened in 2006 and served as the headquarters of Task Force Helmand until it moved to Camp Bastion in August, was handed over to the Afghans in a ceremony on February 24. Meanwhile, Lashkar Gah Durai, which commands an important junction in Helmand, was handed over to the Afghans on March 8. And Main Operating Base Price (MOB), the UK's largest forward location for most of Operation Herrick, was shut down yesterday. Lieutenant General John Lorimer, deputy commander of ISAF, the most senior Briton in Afghanistan, said: 'This is a key milestone in the ISAF mission as we prepare for the conclusion of combat operations at the end of 2014. 'These bases have been vital in the UK contribution to securing the south of the country from the insurgency and their handover underlines the progress being made in reducing the ISAF footprint."" He told the Press Association that he had 'no doubts' that Afghan forces will be able to look after their own security beyond the end of this year. He said the Afghan National Security Forces had grown into a 'competent organisation', who were: 'capable, confident in themselves, and credible in the eyes of the Afghan people'. 'Everything I've seen since I've been out here this time, since June last year, leads me to believe that the Afghans will be able to look after their own security,' he said. Lieutenant Colonel Steve Davies, commanding officer of Task Force Helmand Engineer Group, agreed that the drawdown was a sign of how successful the Afghan National Security Forces had been in taking over the fighting role in the country. Positive: Brigadier Woodman said he had seen huge progress in Helmand since his last tour of duty in 2009/10, giving him 'hope for the future'. Above, Camp Bastion .

Above, ammunition boxes and explosive containers are pictured at Camp Bastion in March this year . However, he added that tearing down . bases which British troops 'fought so hard to build' in Afghanistan . carries a certain amount of . sentimentality for those who have served there over the last few years. 'For those who have completed a number of tours there will be a sentimental aspect to it,' he said. 'I think it is satisfying to see the move that has taken place because if you look where Afghanistan was over a decade ago and where it is now, it is unrecognisable. 'If we roll forward to where we are now and one can look at it that we are tearing down structures that we fought so hard to build, it is a sign of development and I see it very much as a part of mission success for the ANSF because they have developed to a point where we don't need those points of presence.' Lt Col Davies likened the programme to dismantling an entire village and carting it away - with the difference being that they have to stay safe, secure and supplied until the last soldiers leave. Death toll: A total of 448 UK forces personnel have died in the country since the conflict began in 2001 - and more than 5,000 still remain there. Above, the coffin of Warrant Officer Ian Fisher, from the 3rd battalion, the Mercian Regiment, who died in a suicide blast in Afghanistan, is carried from Lichfield Cathedral in Staffordshire . Speaking before MOB Price's closure yesterday, Major Oliver Major, the commanding officer of C Company of 3 Mercian Regiment, said that at its peak, the base held up to 2,000 soldiers - but at the end, it was home to just 200. He said what home comforts the base had - including a canteen and a gym - were slowly taken away - and for the last 10 days, the soldiers had eaten field rations and lived out of what they could carry in their rucksacks. 'We are an infantry company, being out and about and doing stuff on the ground is what we do,' he said. 'The guys are very, very adaptable. 'As long as they have got the basics of life, as long as they have somewhere to wash, as long as they have decent food, as long as they have a way of talking to home, they will adapt to whatever they are told to do.' The dismantling of MOB Price was led by Captain David Goodman, of Aldershot-based Royal Logistics Corps. Equipment left in several ways, including helicopter, combat logistic patrols (CLPs) and regular road lorries, he said, all inside ISO shipping containers. Speaking before the base closed, Capt Goodman said: 'I'm now dreaming of ISO containers. There have been so many here, every day we are sending out 20 to 30, and it is a nightmare. You wake up in the middle of the night thinking ""did this container go?"".' He said that with 20-30 different military and civilian units involved in the closure, it had been impossible to keep everyone happy. He added: 'On the last day when everything is loaded, when the last vehicles are about to go and the last helicopters are about to go out and we leave this place, it will be quite a nice feeling. I'm not going to miss this place.'","British Combat Logistics Patrol pictured arriving at Camp Bastion after leaving military bases in Helmand Province .

But it seems Whitehall mandarins, like doctors, are creatures of habit and prefer old school pagers. New figures released this week show that since 2010 Government departments spent a staggering £500,000 on outdated 80s-style pagers. Pagers were popular with yuppies in the 80s, and it seems are still popular with civil servants . Largely redundant: Figures have revealed ministers have spent almost £500,000 on 80s-style pagers . The bill - paid for by the UK taxpayer - was racked up by eight ministries, including the Ministry of Justice and the Department of Health. But . by far the biggest spenders were civil servants from the Ministry of Defence, which has . 2,643 of the old fashioned devices costing £9,600 a month. Labour's . shadow Cabinet Office minister Jonathan Ashworth said: 'We knew the . Tories' economic policy was stuck in the 1980s, but spending this amount . on pagers seems an excessive tribute to Margaret Thatcher's era.' However, it says its pagers are used by troops in the field. A Government source said: 'As part of our long-term economic plan we saved taxpayers £10 billion last year by cutting the Whitehall waste which Labour never addressed in office. 'We've got rid of over 1000 pagers but won't apologise for using them when required for our soldiers in Afghanistan, those handling explosive materials and those who respond to emergency situations - is Labour really suggesting we take them away from these men and women?' He added that there are lots of places in Government where mobile phones are banned, such as intelligence-led meetings like Cobra, because mobile phones can be tracked, and event of emergency crisis its possible mobiles will stop working. Doctors still use pagers for when they are in hospital and need to respond to an emergency . Portable: William Hague, now Foreign Minister, was a devotee, pictured here with a pager clipped to his belt while on the campaign train in Uxbridge . In civilian life, the text-only gadgets . are rarely used. Doctors and the emergency services still employ them so . they can be contacted quickly. They are also still used by birdwatchers keen to hear about rare sightings. According to the Rare Bird Alert: 'To this day, pagers are still the most highly efficient . way to receive bird news in the field. 'They work in almost every corner . of the country, unlike mobile phones which have plenty of ""reception . black holes"" especially in popular birding areas.' Before mobile phones the gadgets - . often called bleepers - were the only way to keep in touch on the go. They were notorious for being popular with yuppies and drug dealers. Now however, they are virtually obsolete. The . figures emerged after a Parliamentary Question directed to Defence . Secretary Philip Hammond was tabled by Sheila Gilmore, the Labour MP for . Edinburgh East. She . asked: 'How many pagers have been provided to staff by his Department . since May 2010; and what the cost to the Department was of providing . those pagers.' In a written . answer, Ludlow MP Philip Dunne, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of . State for Defence, said: 'In May 2010, there were 3,497 pagers in use by . Ministry of Defence staff at a cost of around £14,000 per month. 'In December 2013, there were 2,463 pagers in use at a cost of around £9,600 per month across Defence.

Britain could get its first cannabis cafe if a Green Party councillor's attempt to open a shop in Kent gets the go ahead. Ian Driver, a councillor for Thanet District Council, has already started looking for possible sites for an Amsterdam-style cafe in Margate or Ramsgate in anticipation of a law change. Mr Driver, who has admitted to being an ex-recreational drug-user, has submitted his proposals in response to what he considers a shift in popular opinion towards legalising the class-B drug. In February, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said that the UK should explore alternatives to a blanket ban on drugs and Britain should be at the heart of the debate. Scroll down for video . Britain's first cannabis cafe would be modelled on an Amsterdam-style coffee shop . In response to this, Mr Driver believes there is now a demand in Britain for a venue where users would be able to smoke the class-B drug in the same way as in Amsterdam. Similar plans for a members-only cannabis cafe in Manchester, where users would have only been able to buy the drug once legalised, were rejected in January. But Mr Driver believes his plans, with the backing of the community, stand a better chance of being approved and he is holding a public meeting in Thanet tomorrow to gather local opinion. However, Mr Driver has faced opposition from Kent Police, who refused to even discuss the issue. Anne Barnes, Kent's Police and Crime Commissioner for the area, declined an invitation to attend the meeting where a number of speakers will debate the proposals. Speakers due to attend the meeting include professor Alex Stevens from The University of Kent, who is an expert on the subject of drugs and crime and has written several books on the topic. Last year, Mr Stevens backed a controversial trial by Kings College London which involved 'the nasal administration of cocaine' by hundreds of students. Other attendees will include the Kent Cannabis Consortium, a group which meets to discuss the plant and the laws surrounding it, and charity UK Cannabis Social Clubs. A Kent Councillor for Thanet, Ian Driver, (left) is leading plans to launch Britain's first cannabis cafe. A public meeting discussing the plans will be held tomorrow in Broadstairs, Kent. Alex Stevens (right), a professor at The University of Kent and an expert on drugs and crime will be attending the meeting . Mr Driver told The Independent that he had been 'inundated with messages from local cannabis users who said they will be . coming to the meeting'. He said: 'The debate about drugs and policing . is becoming much more topical.' But Kent police commissioner Ms Barnes told the newspaper that a cannabis cafe would be illegal unless drug laws were changed. She said: 'We live in a democracy and if people . want the law changed on the use of cannabis, then they really need to . lobby their local MP.' Kent police commissioner Anne Barnes said that a cannabis cafe in in the area would be illegal unless drug laws were changed . This is not the first time the concept of a cannabis cafe has been floated in the UK. In January, police in Manchester blocked the introduction of a cannabis 'social club' in the city's Northern Quarter. The man behind the club was Colin Davies who once famously handed the Queen a bouquet of flowers containing cannabis. His planned club would have been open to members only at a fee of £35 per year. Drugs would not have been sold at the cafe unless there had been a change in the law. But Greater Manchester Police said that the cafe would attract criminality and would be difficult to police and the concept was quashed. The Netherlands tried to stamp out illegal drug dealing in the 1970s by introducing cannabis cafes - called 'coffee shops'. Recreational drugs, including marijuana, are still illegal in Amsterdam but cannabis and some hallucinogenic mushrooms - known as 'magic' mushrooms, have been decriminalised and may be used in these 'coffee shops' under certain restrictions. To enter the shop you must be over 18 and the coffee shops are not permitted to sell alcohol. They must also be licensed and display a green and white license in the window. Some drug experts say that the cafes keep users away from harder drugs. Do not confuse a cannabis coffee shop and an actual coffee shop: A licensed seller of cannabis products is referred to as a coffeeshop, a koffiehuis (coffee house) sells coffee and light meals.","Councillor Ian Driver for Thanet, Kent, is looking for venues in the county .

A three-year-old has become the first child in Britain to have a battery-powered pump to help his failing heart. Ashton Hutcheson, three, was fitted with the HeartWare device to keep him alive until an organ becomes available for transplant. According to his mother Shanna, 22, from Aberdeen, the operation was his last hope. Fighting: Ashton Hutcheson, three, was fitted with the device to keep him alive until an organ becomes available for transplant . Ashton is the second child in the world to use the device which is plugged in at home or in hospital and is powered by a battery pack when he is out. The child was diagnosed with a rare condition called Dilated Cardiomyopathy, which usually only affects adults. 'He is still a very sick little boy, but it's hoped the pump will keep him alive until a heart becomes available for transplant,' said Shanna. For the first time since being admitted to Newcastle's Freeman Hospital on January 20, Ashton left the grounds to go to the park powered by his batteries. Mother Shanna kissed her son who was admitted to hospital with a rare condition which usually only affects adults . It was a moment his mother thought she'd never again see. 'Ashton loved it,' she said. 'He was in his wheelchair but was giggling and laughing. He was so chuffed with feeding the ducks. 'I never thought I'd get my little boy back - I really thought he would die. Poorly: Ashton is the second child in the world to use the device . 'Before he had the surgery, doctors told me I had two choices - take him home to die peacefully or put him through an operation where there was a strong chance he might not survive anyway. I told them to do whatever it took to save him.' Shanna, who says Ashton's fight for a normal life will only begin when he has a heart transplant, is appealing to people to sign up for organ donation. Figures released by NHS England show that 2013 saw the highest number of people south of the border donating organs after death and the highest number of transplants. Donations in Scotland are also at an all-time high with a 31 per cent increase in the number of donors. However, single mother Shanna says more needs to be done and too many people die waiting for organs. 'Many of my friends and even strangers who have heard about Ashton have signed up for organ donation,' she said. 'But everyone who is able to needs to do it. It's sad when someone dies, but one person's organs can save several other lives.' Ashton became ill in October last year. The Royal Aberdeen Children's Hospital diagnosed an enlarged liver caused by a heart problem. They finally diagnosed the rare condition Dilated Cardiomyopathy, which usually only affects adults. 'They told me he could die,' said Shanna. 'His heart was not pumping, it was twitching. His organs were failing. I remember at that point just screaming out ""he is going to die"" and falling to the ground. It was too much to take in.' Holding on: Ashton Hutcheson can now visit the park thanks to the battery-powered pump . Loving: Ashton Hutcheson, three, with his mother Shanna who is hoping her son can pull through . Ashton was taken by air ambulance to Glasgow's Yorkhill Hospital where doctors gave him a one in three chance of survival. Ashton became so poorly that doctors told Shanna he only had 24 hours to live. 'I had him so young and I couldn't imagine what life would be like with a baby. 'Now I was losing him, I couldn't picture my life without him. But I wasn't allowed to hold him in my arms and cuddle him - I could have given him an infection. Life-saving: Ashton Hutcheson, three, was fitted with the HeartWare device (pictured) to keep him alive . The HeartWare Ventricular Assist System is designed to assist a weakened or poorly functioning left . ventricle . 'I just had to watch while he slipped away. I cried and I screamed. That's when they told me I could take him home to die or chance the operation.' Ashton underwent the complex eight-hour surgery at the end of January. Shanna is now living for the day her son will receive a new heart. Until then, she is staying with him at the hospital. HeartWare is a small pump which attaches directly to the heart. The HeartWare Ventricular Assist System is designed to assist a weakened or poorly functioning left ventricle. It is used as a stop-gap for transplant patients who are at risk of death from heart failure. The device involves general anaesthetic, the opening up of the breast bone, a ventilator to help the patient breathe and a cardiopulmonary bypass - a technique which takes over the function of the heart and lungs during surgery. Once the HeartWare device is successfully implanted, a thin, flexible cable then exits the skin and a small controller and power pack (rechargeable batteries) run the pump. That in turn helps the heart to keep blood flowing around the body. It is used as a stop-gap for transplant patients who are at risk of death from heart failure .","Ashton Hutcheson, three, is the second child in the world to use the device .

Tragic: Maureen Stone, 72, died after she was brutally assaulted with a curtain pole at a care home in Trentham, Staffordshire, an inquest heard . A grandmother died 13 days after being viciously attacked with a curtain pole by a fellow care home resident, an inquest has heard. Maureen Shone, 72, was found by staff on the floor of her bedroom in Trentham, Staffordshire after being brutally assaulted by a male patient. The helpless dementia sufferer was found covered in bruises Selwyn House, and the metal pole used to beat her was found dangling by her bed, covered in blood. The inquest at North Staffordshire Coroner's Court heard she had been put to bed early that evening. But it emerged a sensor â€“ placed under Mrs Shone's mattress to alert staff if she got out of bed â€“ had not been switched on by staff. Carers then found her lying on the floor two hours later after hearing a banging noise coming from her room. Rebecca Gittings, the manager of the unit where Mrs Shone was staying, told the hearing: 'I was walking up the corridor to give another patient some medicine when I heard a faint banging noise coming from Maureen's room. 'I went in to check if everything was all right and once I got inside I saw that her room was completely trashed. 'There were pictures all over the floor, her bedding was everywhere and the curtains had been pulled down. Maureen was banging her head on the floor.' Care assistant Azyeb Haile ran to Mrs Gittings after hearing her shout for assistance. Miss Haile said: 'I saw Maureen, she was lying on the floor. There was blood everywhere. 'Her room was messy and there were things broken on the floor. The curtain pole was pulled down and had blood on it. I went out of the room and saw a male patient standing outside. Home: She was found covered in blood on the floor of Selwyn House. She died 13 days after returning from hospital . 'I checked him over and saw that his hands, trousers and shoes were covered in blood. There was nobody else around so I spoke to the man and asked him what he had done but he was shouting about his wife.' Mrs Shone was transferred to the University Hospital of North Staffordshire where doctors found she had severe facial injuries, a cut lip and a possible rib fracture. She was kept in for 48 hours before being allowed to return to the Guardian Care-run home. Although Mrs Shone returned to the home two days later she died on November 5 after collapsing. Post mortem results recorded that Mrs Shone died of pneumonia, aggravated by dementia and blunt force trauma. Treatment: Mrs Shone was taken to The University Hospital of North Staffordshire and was there for two days . Mrs Shone's daughter, Patricia Shone, went to the hospital after being called by staff . Miss Shone, 52, from Stoke-on-Trent, said: 'Given that I had quite a few phone calls about her falling over I wasn't unduly concerned, so I went to the hospital the following day. 'But when I saw my mum I had a bit of a shock. She looked like she had been in a boxing match. 'She was bruised all over her face and chest, her nose was bent, her eyes were black and she was barely recognisable. The inquest at North Staffordshire Coroner's Court heard she had been put to bed early that evening . 'I was horrified to learn from a member of hospital staff that my mum had been beaten with a metal pole. 'I wasn't best pleased because she should have been asleep in what should have been a safe environment.' North Staffordshire Coroner Ian Smith is due to deliver his ruling on the case on March 27.

As it passes through a clear night sky, you might be forgiven for thinking that the slow moving small white light was a low aircraft. However, you could not be more wrong. That gliding pinprick, if you are lucky enough to see it, is in fact the 450 tonnes that makes up the International Space Station (ISS), and it is constantly hurtling through space at some 17,500 miles per hour, at an altitude of some 250 miles. Because the ISS has been orbiting above the heads of us mere earthlings for some 16 years, it has become all too easy to become rather blasé about it, and to think of it as no more remarkable than, say, a normal weather satellite. British astronaut Major Tim Peake is one of the stars of a two-and-a-half-hour pioneering live broadcast from the ISS and Mission Control in Houston on Sunday on Channel 4 . However, with the showing of Live From Space, a fascinating mini-season of programmes on Channel 4, it is high time that we stopped taking this incredible spacecraft for granted. On Sunday night, the season culminates in a two-and-a-half-hour pioneering live broadcast from the ISS and Mission Control in Houston, during which viewers will be able to watch the astronauts onboard the space station as they travel around the world in 90 minutes. In addition, the astronauts will share their breathtaking views of planet Earth, and they will explain what exactly they get up to all day in their celestial home and office. Helping to make sense of what we will be seeing is Britain’s first ever astronaut, Major Tim Peake, 41, a former Army helicopter pilot who is due to visit the ISS for a 6-month mission next year. Understandably, Tim always keeps a look out for the space station when it passes above him. ‘I always get excited when I see the ISS,’ he admits, ‘and I even have an app on my phone which gives me an alarm whenever it is getting close! Of course, it’s a bit different when you’re going up there yourself.’ The International Space Station (ISS) is constantly hurtling through space at some 17,500 miles per hour, at an altitude of some 250 miles . Tim explains what life will be like for him when he does get there. ‘The daily working routine is punishing,’ he says. ‘Much of the time, we will performing scientific experiments, and then clearing them up.’ One question Tim is often asked is whether the ISS is claustrophobic. ‘I’ve never heard anybody describe it as cramped!’ he says. ‘It’s the size of a Boeing 747-400, and there are only six of us on board, so there is plenty of room. In fact, it quite usual to spend a whole day in one of the modules on your own and not see another person.’ Naturally, Tim and his fellow astronauts have to train immensely hard. As well as having to become proficient scientists, they also have to learn to dock manually visiting vehicles with the ISS, go on space walks, and - perhaps most challenging of all - to deal with each other. ‘Managing relationships is one of the most important parts of our training,’ says Tim. ‘You just have to get on well. Crews consist of people from different countries and cultures, and we all have to be aware of that.’ As well as having to become proficient scientists, the astronauts also have to learn to dock manually visiting vehicles with the ISS, go on space walks, and - perhaps most challenging of all - to deal with each other . One of the most intense periods of training is when the astronauts are taken to a cave in Sardinia, where they spend a week working together on problems and tasks. ‘It’s funny to think that an underground cave is a good analogue for space,’ says Tim, ‘but it really is. Physically, it’s a tough environment, we have to change clothes a lot, take photographs, and take lots of scientific samples. And all the time, we have to work on our leadership and followership skills.’ During Tim’s six-month mission, he will have very little downtime, but when he does, like many of the astronauts, he might head to a 7-window cupola from where the crew can gaze down on the planet they call home. ‘Although the cupola is meant to be a place that is used for observing Earth and controlling robotic arms,’ says Tim, ‘I know that many use the cupola simply to take in the amazing view.’ And it’s that view that we will all be able to enjoy on Sunday night when Channel 4 links up to the ISS for what promises to be literally an out-of-this-world programme. The man behind the show is TV producer Tom Brisley, who has long been fascinated by space. ‘I had always wanted to do something about space,’ he says, ‘but the challenge was always finding the right way to tell the story.’ ‘The eureka moment finally came when it occurred to me that the ISS takes 90 minutes to orbit the Earth – that makes a perfect length for a TV programme.’ The full programme will in fact last two-and-a-half hours. The most powerful element will undoubtedly be the breathtaking views of the globe, which will be filmed by three high-definition cameras that are attached to the exterior of the ISS. ‘Of course, we won’t be able to control the weather,’ says Tom, ‘but there’s no doubt that come what way, there will be some amazing views.’ The astronauts will share their breathtaking views of planet Earth, and they will explain what exactly they get up to all day in their celestial home and office . One of the most spectacular phenomena will be witnessing the fall of night across the globe. ‘It will be the most extraordinary sight,’ says Tom. ‘We will be able to watch this line of night creeping across the globe. It will be absolutely spectacular.’ Unfortunately, viewers will not be able to see planets and stars, as the rapid movement of the ISS makes it very difficult for cameras to focus on such distant objects. Like all live TV, the programme will have its technical challenges, and there will be plenty of opportunity for things not to go according to plan. ‘Sometimes Nasa lose the signal from the ISS for 20 to 30 minutes,’ says Tom. ‘If that happens, then we just have to deal with it. But I think that’s going to be part of the fun of the show!’ Also helping to talk viewers through the journey around the earth will be Professor Stephen Hawking, who will help to provide some philosophical ballast to the show. ‘One of the big questions we have to answer is, “Why do we have a space station up there?”’, says Tom. ‘Although lots of vital experiments are carried out into researching cancer, and to examining the behaviour of compounds and plants, we also have to look at the context of the ISS in regards to the future of the human race.’ For many, the astronauts up in the ISS are the Christopher Columbuses of their day. They are starting to explore a place where, one day, mankind may have to inhabit. The Earth is finite, and if man wants to continue, he will have to make his home elsewhere. The ISS is therefore just a very small step for man. Live from Space: Lap of the Planet airs at 7.30pm, Sunday, Channel 4 . The route of the ISS would make .

A teenage boy at one of Britain’s most expensive public schools has been arrested over allegations of ‘harassing’ a young girl by posting indecent photos of her online. The 16-year-old is a pupil at Westminster School which charges boarders more than £30,000 a year. Former pupils include Nick Clegg, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Helena  Bonham Carter. A 16-year-old pupil from £30,000-a-year Westminster School has been arrested and questioned on suspicion of harassment, distributing indecent images of children and threats to cause criminal damage . Police are understood to have been called in earlier this month after an argument between the boy, the son of a Harley Street consultant, and the girl who is also 16. The boy was taken into custody and questioned on suspicion of harassment, distributing indecent images of children and threats to cause criminal damage. He was released on bail while police continue their investigations. The girl is not a pupil at Westminster, but news of the teenagers’ dispute and subsequent police involvement is the subject of gossip at the prestigious school situated between Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament. One source said: ‘Everybody’s talking about it. As we understand it, they had an argument and he posted explicit pictures of her.’ Westminster is regarded as one of Britain’s most exclusive independent schools and has a history dating back to the 11th century. Other old boys include the spy Kim Philby and disgraced former Lib Dem Cabinet minister Chris Huhne. Day fees start at £22,500 a  year, rising to £32,490 for boarders, who make up around a quarter of the 750 pupils. Girls are accepted in the sixth form and number around 130. The boy’s mother, when asked about his arrest, said this week: ‘I can’t comment, sorry.’ A member of the girl’s family said: ‘Obviously we are distraught by what has happened. ‘We are pursuing this to the bitter end and I want this boy to meet his punishment whether by the police, the courts, or by taking private action against him.’ Police are believed to have been called in after an argument between the boy and a 16-year-old girl after which he allegedly posted the picture of her online . Scotland Yard said: ‘Police received an allegation of harassment on March 5. An investigation was launched and on March 5 a boy, aged 16, was arrested on suspicion of harassment, distributing indecent images of children and threats to cause criminal damage and was taken into custody. ‘He was subsequently bailed to a date in mid-April pending further investigation.’ According to the Department for Education, around 3,000 children are excluded from schools every year for sexual bullying, assaults and harassment. The National Union of Teachers and charity ChildLine are deeply concerned by an increase in sexual bullying and sexting on smartphones. Research by the Internet Watch Foundation revealed last month that four in ten teachers know of pupils taking part in sexting. It involves naked or sexual pictures being exchanged by youngsters, often using mobile phone apps such as Snapchat or social networks such as Facebook. The IWF said most children who swap explicit pictures with a boyfriend or girlfriend did not believe the images would be widely circulated. But they often end up being shared on social networks.

A key figure in France’s high-tax socialist government kept millions of pounds hidden in Britain, his estranged wife claimed on Thursday. Jerome Cahuzac, 61, was President Francois Hollande’s Budget Minister - meaning he was in charge of clamping down on wealthy citizens trying to avoid paying tax - until he was forced to resign in shame last year. But now his wife Patricia, who is divorcing her disgraced husband, has claimed he kept more than £2 million hidden in a bank account on the Isle of Man. French President Francois Hollande expelled Jerome Cahuzac amid revelations he hid millions offshore . Much of it was due to be invested in properties in London, where French judges are currently carrying out an inquiry. Mr Cahuzac faces prosecution and possibly five years in jail after he admitted to the account during ‘an investigation into tax fraud,’ according to France’s Sud Ouest newspaper. ‘The money trail led to the Isle of Man, where the equivalent of 2.5 million euros was found in an account opened between 1997 and 2004. The money would mostly have been invested in property in the UK’, the newspaper said. Judges Renaud van Ruymbeke and Roger Le Loire are now widening their inquiry to other parts of Britain, especially London. Jerome Cahuzac has been accused of tax fraud . Lawyers for the Cahuzacs would not . comment on the latest revelations, which were confirmed by legal sources . close to the tax investigation. Mr Cahuzac resigned from Mr Hollande’s government a year ago following revelations that he also kept millions hidden in accounts in Switzerland and Singapore.

It follows a series of reports that the former world champion racing driver's condition was worsening after his low speed ski crash in the French Alps.

Schumacher was placed in an induced coma after undergoing two operations to remove blood clots from his brain in the wake of his skiing accident on December 29 . Schumacher has been in an artificial coma since December 29. But doctors say most . artificial comas last for a period of two to three weeks. In a statement issued on behalf of the 45-year-old's family, the F1 star's agent said: 'We are, and remain confident, Michael will pull through and will wake up.' 'There sometimes are small, encouraging signs, but we also know this is the time to be very patient. 'Michael has suffered severe injuries. It is very hard to comprehend for all of us that Michael, who had overcome a lot of precarious situations in the past, has been hurt so terribly in such a banal situation. 'It was clear from the start this will be a long and hard fight for Michael, and we are taking this fight on together with the team of doctors, whom we fully trust.

Oscar Pistorius threw up in the dock again on Thursday after horrific images of his girlfriend's body were shown in court. Gasps were heard throughout the Pretoria courtroom when close-up pictures were briefly displayed, apparently by accident, on a computer screen by his defence team. They showed Reeva Steenkamp's skull, body and her injuries after she was shot dead by the Paralympian at his home. Pistorius began violently retching at the sight of his girlfriend's corpse before being handed a green bucket which he vomited into repeatedly. Scroll down for videos from the court case . Agony: Pistorius covers his head in despair as he listens to graphic evidence of the moment he killed Miss Steenkamp on Valentine's Day last year . Despair: The court was briefly shown, apparently by accident, graphic images of Miss Steenkamp's blood-stained body after he shot her dead . Too much to bear: Pistorius covers his face with his hands as he listens to forensic evidence during his trial . Earlier, a photograph of Pistorius's . blood-stained prosthetic legs was used by his chief defense lawyer in a . bid to show that the athlete was wearing them, as he says, when he broke . down the toilet door with a cricket bat. The . image, showing the prosthetic limbs with white socks and stained with . Reeva Steenkamp's blood up to the knee, was displayed by lawyer Barry . Roux on a TV monitor at Pistorius's murder trial. The . chief defence lawyer at Oscar Pistorius's murder trial today . highlighted alleged missteps by police and questioned their treatment of . key evidence during the investigation. Lawyer . Barry Roux grilled a police forensics expert for a second day, . challenging his analysis of a bullet-marked toilet door that was removed . from Pistorius's bathroom after he shot Reeva Steenkamp. In . an aggressive start to his cross-examination, Mr Roux questioned . whether Colonel Johannes Vermeulen even had the right qualifications to . examine marks on the door that offer crucial evidence to what happened . the moment the model was killed. He also forced Col Vermeulen to admit that police may have contaminated the crime scene during their investigation. Accused: Pistorius claims he went to the bedroom to put on his prosthetics before smashing down the door . Centre of attention: The athlete is surrounded by security as he makes his way through Pretoria to the court . Mr Roux asked what happened to some fragments from the door that went missing after police investigators took possession of it. Col Vermeulen said he asked about the missing splinters, but repeatedly said he 'couldn't remember' which colleague he spoke to. The forensics analyst also conceded that footprints that appeared to be from police . boots were seen in evidence photos, but later rubbed off. Mr . Roux argued they could have been made by Pistorius's prosthetic legs - . which could have backed up a crucial argument by the sprinter that he . was wearing them when he smashed down the door. Col Vermeulen earlier argued Pistorius would have been on his stumps both . when he fired the shots that killed Miss Steenkamp and when he broke . down the door. The lawyer also noted that Col Vermeulen had not read Pistorius's version of events on the night of the killing until after he had completed his forensic study of the door and was therefore leaning toward the prosecution's version of what happened. Key evidence: Forensic analyst Colonel Johannes Vermeulen stands in front of the toilet door through which Oscar Pistorius shot Reeva Steenkamp while holding the cricket bat the athlete then used to break it down . Key moment: The re-enactment is critical to the case as it tests the athlete's assertions about exactly what happened on the night he killed Miss Steenkamp in his bathroom on Valentine's Day last year . Pistorius . has said he shot Miss Steenkamp by mistake through the door, fearing . there was a dangerous intruder in the house. The prosecution says he . intentionally killed her after an argument. Yesterday, . Col Vermeulen argued that Pistorius was on his stumps at the time he . broke down the door with the cricket bat, contradicting the . Paralympian's assertion that he was wearing his prosthetic legs. The issue is critical to the case as . it tests the athlete's assertions about exactly what happened on the . night he killed Miss Steenkamp in his bathroom on Valentine's Day last . year. Pistorius . says he fearfully approached the bathroom on his stumps and shot Miss . Steenkamp by mistake while believing she was an intruder. According . to his account, he then put on his prostheses and tried to kick down . the locked toilet door before hitting it with the bat after realising . what he had done. However, Col Vermeulen said the bat . was used to hit the door from a low position and knelt and swung . Pistorius's cricket bat to demonstrate his . point. Reconstruction: Colonel Johannes Vermeulen of the South African Police Service stands in court in front of the toilet door through which Pistorius shot Reeva Steenkamp . Evidence: Colonel Vermeulen kneels down to show that Pistorius was not wearing his prostheses at the time . Analysis: The height at which the bat struck the door is measured in court in an attempt by the prosecution to determine whether Pistorius was on his prosthetic legs at the time . Demonstration: The forensic expert shows the point where the bat struck the door, causing it to splinter . He also believed Pistorius was on his stumps . when he fired through the toilet door, based on the angle of the bullet . marks in the door, which was on display in the courtroom alongside a . recreation of the cubicle. He told the court: 'The . marks on the door are actually consistent with him not having his legs . on and I suspect they must be similar to the height that he was when he . fired the shots.' And in a dramatic climbdown, lead prosecutor Gerrie Nel also said that it was no longer part of the state's case that Pistorius was wearing his prosthetics at the time. That . mistaken claim by prosecutors in the early part of the investigation . was used by them to argue there was premeditation in the killing. They asserted that by taking the time to put on his legs before going to the bathroom, Pistorius showed premeditation before killing the 29-year-old model. Evidence: The bullet holes and shattered wood where Pistorius struck the door are clearly seen here . Clues: Based on the angle and height of the four bullet holes seen here, Pistorius fired his gun on his stumps, according to forensic analyst Colonel Johannes Vermeulen . Measurements: The court is shown a picture which Col Vermeulen took at the time of his initial investigation a few weeks after Miss Steenkamp was shot on Valentine's Day last year . Detail: This image shows where the bat broke through the door in the weakest part of the panel . Former South African cricketer Herschelle Gibbs, right, has claimed the bat Oscar Pistorius used to smash down the toilet door after shooting Reeva Steenkamp had been signed by him. Police Colonel Johannes Vermeulen presented the bat as a key piece of evidence about exactly what happened on the night Miss Steenkamp died. Shortly after the bat was shown on TV, Gibbs - @hershybru on Twitter - posted: 'Just saw my signature on the bat used by the accused in oscar trial... lol #neveradullmoment' The prosecution now says Pistorius first . hit the door with a bat in an effort to get to Miss Steenkamp, then . shot through the door. But . in another crucial endorsement of the defence's case, Col Vermeulen . testified that the athlete broke down the door only after he fired his . weapon. 'I would say the door was hit after the shots,' he told the court. Col . Vermeulen earlier demonstrated . that height measurements showed that Pistorius was not wearing his . prostheses at the time. 'It's quite low down on the door,' he testified about one of the marks he said were made by the bat. He said it was 'not the normal position that I would expect from a mark from a cricket bat'. He said marks on the door were consistent with Pistorius 'being in a natural position without his prostheses'. Defence . lawyer Barry Roux countered that Pistorius hit the door with a 'bent . back' and that the low marks were consistent with such a body position. Mr . Vermeulen also said a steel plate in the main bathroom in Pistorius's . home had been damaged by being hit with a 'hard' object, or after the . object fell against it. Overcome: Pistorius shows the strain as he listens to events surrounding the moment he shot his girlfriend . Tough to hear: The athlete - known as Blade Runner - reacts in the dock while listening to the forensic evidence . Emotional: Pistorius reacts while listening to evidence about the moment he shot his girlfriend . Stress: The 27-year-old runner rubs his eyes while taking notes in the dock during the trial . Deliberation: The Olympic athlete confers with a member of his legal team at the North Gauteng High Court . Doubt cast: According to the athlete's account, he put on his prosthetic legs in an effort to kick down the door before using the cricket bat . The steel plate was new evidence. A photo of the damaged plate was shown. Prosecutors say Pistorius intentionally shot 29-year-old Steenkamp after a fight. Those . prosecutors used Mr Vermeulen to show what they say are more . inconsistencies in Pistorius's version of events by erecting the door in . court and, behind it, an exact replica of the cubicle in his house. There was also a replica toilet. The bullet-marked door also had what appeared to be white tags to indicate the bullet holes. Concern: The athlete's uncle Arnold (far left), aunt Lois (second left) and sister Aimee (centre) watch the re-enactment from the public gallery . There for him: The Paralympian's sister Aimee has been in court every day of the trial so far . Pistorius . shot at MIss Steenkamp four times through the door, hitting her in the hip, . arm and head. One shot missed, the court has heard. Led . by questions from prosecutor Gerrie Nel, Mr Vermeulen removed his . blazer and walked down from the witness stand and over to the door to . demonstrate to the judge how he believes the door was hit in the . pre-dawn hours of Valentine's Day last year. He said he was particularly interested in two specific marks on the door that he concluded were made by the bat. With . the use of court photos and by kneeling down in court, Mr Vermeulen . showed the low position that the person could have been in when striking . the door with the bat. The trial continues. Doubt: Pathologist Gert Saayman said the partially digested vegetables he found in the model's stomach suggested Miss Steenkamp (pictured) had food less than two hours before her death at around 3am .

Nicklas Bendtner will be fined by Arsenal after the club opened an internal investigation into bizarre allegations about his conduct on a night out in Copenhagen. Danish tabloid BT claims the 26-year-old centre forward threatened a taxi driver while his  team-mates were getting knocked out of the Champions League by Bayern Munich on Tuesday night. During the incident, it is alleged that Bendtner unbuttoned his trousers, rubbed himself against the side of the cab and whipped the vehicle with his belt. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Wenger and Bentner discuss the Dane's Arsenal future . Controversy: Nicklas Bendtner watches the first leg of Arsenal's Champions League clash with Bayern . Benched: Bendtner has been accused of threatening a taxi driver in Copenhagen . Game for a laugh: But Bendtner looks set to leave Arsenal in the summer . And speaking ahead of Arsenal's derby . clash against Tottenham on Sunday, manager Arsene Wenger hinted the . troubled striker had played his last game for the club and would be . fined. 'Honestly I don't know really what happened because I haven't spoken to him,' said Wenger. 'The only thing that is for sure is he had nothing to do in Copenhagen. Nobody gave him any permission to go to Copenhagen and he will be fined for that. 'For the rest, he has created some trouble there I don't know, I will speak to him today.' Bendtner has not played for the Gunners since February 2, but did start for Denmark in the Wembley friendly against England last week. Asked whether this was the 'final straw' for the player, Wenger said: 'He is at the end of his contract at the end of the season.' The taxi driver was quoted in BT as . saying: ‘I’ve seen drunks and alcoholics in Copenhagen  for over 25 . years, but I’ve never experienced anything like it.’ Bendtner did not travel to Germany due to a suspected knee injury. Arsenal will fine him heavily if he is guilty of wrongdoing. The alleged incident is likely to hammer the final nail in the coffin of Bendtner’s career at the club. Wenger, who is said to be deeply concerned by the accusations, . questioned Bendtner at the club’s London Colney HQ on Thursday. Back on the pitch: Bendtner was with the Denmark squad last week on international duty . Arsenal . have been desperate to permanently off-load the Dane for more than two . years — but his £52,000-a-week wages have proved the stumbling block. His contract expires this summer and he will not be offered a new one. Olivier Giroud and Yaya Sanogo are ahead of him in the pecking order, so Bendtner will only play in an emergency this season. Goalkeeper . Lukasz Fabianski, whose deal expires this summer,  is set to leave . after he rejected a new three-year contract. Arsenal wanted to extend . the Pole’s stay, offering to increase his £50,000-a-week wages. But . Fabianski does not want to spend another season on the Gunners bench . behind first choice Wojciech Szczesny. Fabianski, . 28, has a number of offers on the table, with Schalke, Basle, . Villarreal and Sevilla all keen on the keeper, who would consider . staying in England. Loan spell: Bendtner spent time in Italy with Juventus in the Serie A . And another: The Dane also played for Sunderland for a temporary spell in the North East . The . futures of defenders Bacary Sagna and Thomas Vermaelen are still . unresolved. Arsenal will make a final offer to Sagna, who has refused . two others. The latest is a two-year deal on the same £60,000-a-week . pay. He wants a three-year deal at £90,000 a week. France . international Sagna wants his future resolved before the World Cup. He . is open to staying but knows he can get better deals elsewhere, namely . Monaco, Galatasaray and Inter Milan. Vermaelen’s . advisers are lining up the Arsenal skipper’s next move. He has been on . the sidelines for most of the season due to Per Mertesacker and Laurent . Koscielny’s outstanding partnership. The Belgian will hold talks with . Wenger at the end of the season. But his representatives are making . moves to ensure he has  other offers if he leaves Arsenal.

Mitt Romney came on the Today Show this morning to weigh in on the security threats facing the Winter Olympics but added his two cents about the prospect of a Republican beating the likely Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, should she decide to run. Asked by Savannah Guthrie on Today whether or not Mrs Clinton is beatable, Romney said: ‘I'm sure she is, because people recognize the country is just not doing what it needs to be doing’. He vehemently denied that he would ever run again after his failed 2012 bit, and then gave off a quick list of possible GOP contenders. Speaking of the past: Mitt Romney was in charge of the Salt Lake City Olympic Games in Utah in 2002, just months after the September 11 terrorist attacks, and said Russia seems to be handling security threats well . ‘This is a time for Chris Christie, Mike Huckabee, Jeb Bush, Mike Pence, John Kasich- a long list- Marco Rubio. There are a lot of folks who should have the chance to be our nominee and I'm going to support the one who gets the prize,’ he said. Romney’s visit to the New York City set came in conjunction with the mounting security fears for the winter Olympics that begin in a few short weeks in Russia near the Black Sea. The former Masssachusetts Governor was in charge of the 2002 Winter Games which presented their own set of security challenges given that they were held just months after the September 11 terrorist attacks. In spite of the disapproval he touted against Russia throughout the 2012 campaign, Romney was very complimentary of the Russian government’s efforts to secure the site and did his best to reassure any anxious viewers, saying he would 'absolutely' bring his family to the Games. ‘There's never been a Games that I know of that has been so targeted for specific threats as you're seeing at Sochi. At the same time, the level of security preparations appears to be at an unprecedented level,’ Romney said. ‘I believe the Games will be safe. That doesn’t mean there’s a 100 per cent guarantee anywhere in the world today. But this is, after all, a dangerous corner of the world. Changing tune: In spite of his harsh rhetoric against Russia during the 2012 campaign, Romney said that they were taking ever possible precaution in the lead up to the Sochi Games . ‘The specific threats that have been leveled suggest that this is an area that could be targeted and therefore there's a degree of risk associated with, well frankly life today in a world where terrorism exists.’ Romney said that while the warnings about the Black Widow terrorists and other specific women that appear to pose a threat to the safety of the Games may come as shocking and scary to some, he sees them as examples of the efficiency of the organizers. New priorities: Rather than running again, Romney said he is happy to have the extra time with his sons and family . ‘Extraordinary intelligence work- that's what happened with our Games that gave me confidence that they'd be safe,’ he said. ‘Now and then we'll hear reports of an individual they're looking for- that suggests they have pretty good intelligence so all in all, it seems to be a very effective security program, but again, no 100 per cent guarantee.’ One point that he parsed out was that he has a high level of confidence of the security at the ‘hard sites’ where the physical events will take place, keeping the athletes and spectators safe during the tournaments, but soft sites will remain an issue- just as they do throughout the world- because there is no way for security officials to check everyone in public areas. ‘Terrorists can move almost wherever they want to go. It only takes one person to go through a sieve of some kind and so a place like Sochi can be surrounded if you will,’ Romney said. ‘I think that people can recognize that the hard sites and the athletes will be safe and spectators when they're in the venues will be safe but it’s the soft places that you can’t be 100 per cent certain will be entirely safe, but my guess is that Russians have done everything humanly possible to protect the Games.’ He maintained that while he still views Russia as a ‘geopolitical adversary’ of the United States and the world since ‘their friends are some of the world's worst actors’ that is not justification enough to keep the Games away from the country. ‘I don’t think you hold off particular countries based upon their politics,’ he said. Lighter moments: Ann is shown messing with Mitt's seemingly immovable mane at one point . Flirty: Mitt is shown tapping Ann's derriere in a tender moment of the film, which begins streaming on January 24 and was shot over the course of the entire campaign . He did wade into the so-called Bridge-gate scandal that is gripping American domestic politics, however, taking a firm line of support for his 'close friend' Chris Christie. Romney's camp considered the New Jersey Governor as a possible vice presidential candidate and selected Christie to give the coveted keynote speech at the Republican National Convention and ended up selecting Wisconsin Senator Paul Ryan instead. He reaffirmed his statement that there are no hard feelings between the two and that he believes that Christie has handled the multiple scandals facing him as he gets off to a rocky start in his second term. 'I've been in touch with Chris and frankly what I think we've seen is a strong leader who took responsibility, he fired people who were responsible for the scandal and he has moved on as a leader and I do believe the American people want to see a strong leader in the White House and he is,' Romney said. The interview this morning also coincided with the release of a documentary about his presidential campaign, appropriately titled 'Mitt', on Netflix today. The filmmaker, Greg Whiteley, followed Romney and his family for six years as part of the making of the film, and though he was overall pleased with the final product, Romney said he was surprised by the fact that more personal moments between he and his wife and the family prayer sessions were included. 'There were some scenes I kinda wish he wouldn't have included. There are couple scenes where we're praying for instance and I knew he was in the room but I didn't think he was actually filming during our prayer,' he said. 'Gosh darn it he captured all that and then he had the chutzpah to actually use it!' 'Most of it's kind of fun as I watch my sons and my grandchildren and daughters-in-law interacting and supporting a guy who was under the microscope.'

"By . Leon Watson . PUBLISHED: . 11:51 EST, 13 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 11:56 EST, 13 March 2014 . Saudi Arabia has issued a list of 50 names new parents are banned from giving their children, including Linda, Lauren, Sandy and Amir. The Arab nation's interior ministry justified the ban by saying the . names either contradicted the culture or religion of the kingdom, or . were foreign, or 'inappropriate'. Among the others are Alice, Elaine and Maya and Binyamin, the Arabic name for Benjamin. International fashion model Linda Evangelista would not be able to name a child after herself in Saudi Arabia under new rules . Paul McCartney's late wife Linda McCartney, pictured here with her range of vegetarian food in 1991, would have been frowned at by the authorities in Saudi Arabia because of her name . The names fit into at least three categories: those that offend perceived religious sensibilities, those that are affiliated to royalty and those that are of non-Arabic or non-Islamic origin, Gulf News reported. A number of other names appear that do not necessarily fit into any category and it is therefore unclear as to why they would have been banned. Names such as Abdul Naser and Binyamin are not found to be particularly offensive to Muslims. Binyamin is believed in Islam to be the son of Prophet Jacob (Yaqoub) and the full brother of Prophet Joseph, but it also happens to be the name of the Israeli prime minister. Abdul Naser, similarly, is the name of the famous Arab nationalist ruler of Egypt, who was at odds with Saudi Arabia. Names such as Abdul Nabi and Abdul Hussain, common among Shiites and some Sunni Arabs, are controversial because of the multiple ways in which they can be interpreted. The name Binyamin has been banned, perhaps it is because it's the first name of the Israeli Prime Minister, Binyamin Netanyahu . Fans of the 1978 film Grease would not be able to name their child after their favourite character if it was Sandy, played here be Olivia Newton-John (left). Danny, played by John Travolata (right), would be OK though . Royal visit: Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah, who has 38 children by many wives, is pictured with the Queen in London in 2007. His country has no problem with the name Elizabeth . Abdul in Arabic means 'worshipper of' or 'slave of', while Nabi means 'prophet' and Rasool means 'messenger'. Those who oppose such names argue that Abdul means 'worshipper of' and is therefore forbidden as only God can be worshipped. Most Muslim names with Abdul carry one of God's 99 Islamic names. Abdul Rahman, for example, comes from the name Al Rahman. Another set of names that is banned includes those that have to do with royalty, especially titles such as Sumuw (highness), Malek (king) and Malika (Queen) and other royal terms such as Al Mamlaka (the kingdom). Some of the names on the list are not uncommon among Arabs, including Malak (angel), Amir (prince), Abdul Naser and Jibreel (Gabriel). Malaak (angel) Abdul Aati . Abdul Naser . Abdul Musleh .

"By . Guy Walters . PUBLISHED: . 20:35 EST, 10 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 20:35 EST, 10 March 2014 . When archaeologists investigated two 7,000-year-old corpses unearthed in Spain in 2006, they made two startling discoveries. One . of the two Mesolithic hunter-gatherers had carried African and European . genes, which meant he had dark skin and blue eyes. But there was an . even more amazing revelation from the scientists when they announced the . results of their research last month. The man's genes also showed he  was lactose intolerant. This is a condition in which the body has difficulty in absorbing the sugar that is commonly found in milk. For 3m people in the UK a glass of cow juice is about as welcome as being force-fed cod liver oil . A problem drinking milk? What sort of hunter-gatherer was this? Surely food intolerances are a bit modern and namby-pamby? Well, . I can identify strongly with this Mesolithic milk dodger, as I too . suffer from lactose intolerance. I'm one of the estimated three million . people in the UK for whom a glass of cow juice is about as welcome as . being force-fed cod liver oil. Much to my regret, I only discovered . that I had the condition last year, when I was going on a punitive . three-day hike through the Yorkshire Dales with a good friend. At one . point, as we were puffing up a particularly strenuous climb, he turned . to me and observed, 'You do realise that you burp ALL the time?' At . first, I was in denial. Surely everybody burps a lot? Maybe I was just . bad at hiding it. But by the time we reached the peak, I started to . wonder - not least for the sake of my friendship - whether I did have . something wrong with me. What happened next was like something out of a . film, albeit one that goes straight to video. On a distant dale, I . saw some cows. There they were, munching away, and the sight of them . suddenly made me realise: Of course, it was milk. Wretched milk. Until . then, I had dismissed people who claim to have intolerances as being . vain and self-important. I'm not talking about those with allergies, . which are clearly serious, and can be life-threatening. I'm referring to . those annoying people who carp on about being intolerant to this and . that, when they are in fact just fussy eaters. A genetic mutation in the majority of the population means the ability to drink milk can be enjoyed for years . But it was time to . confront my prejudices. I was going to give up milk. No more breakfast . cereal, no more milk in my tea and coffee. The idea of giving up my . cherished daily bowl of Grape Nuts seemed appalling, but I had to give . it a try. Within about two days, my belching had almost vanished. There was no more effervescence, my guts no longer painfully bloated . with gas. There was no doubt that milk was the culprit. I had . cracked it, although I did curse that I had not kicked the milk churn . decades before. All those years of subjecting friends and family to . constant burping, all that discomfort needlessly endured, and all . because I hadn't tolerated those with intolerances. Initially, I kept . quiet about the whole business, as I didn't want to be a dietary bore. And then I came across the startling fact that 75 per cent of the world . has some degree of lactose intolerance. It was another . cow-on-a-distant-dale moment. Hang on, I thought, you people who can . drink milk, it's you who are the weird ones! Not me, I'm the normal one. As . it turns out, the ability to tolerate lactose is really only found in . people in northern Europe, North America and in pockets in the Middle . East and western and southern Africa. If you go anywhere else, you'll . find that everybody is like me and Mesolithic Man. Why is this? The . answer lies in the enzyme lactase, which breaks down the lactose in . milk. Although all of us are born with lactase, after about the age of . two, the levels in our small intestines diminish rapidly for most . people, which makes it hard for lactose to be broken down, and therefore . causes discomfort, which is often manifested by burping. But in . countries such as the UK, a genetic mutation in the majority of the . population means that lactase persists, and therefore the ability to . drink milk can be enjoyed for many decades after infancy. Last month, . British scientists who have studied the residue in cooking pots from . archaeological digs estimated that this mutation may have taken place . 6,000 years ago. Opinion is divided as to why this mutation which . allows some of us to drink milk took place. Some suggest that when our . ancestors started to consume dairy produce, they built up a tolerance . which altered their genes. Others think that the mutation happened . before mammalian milk was drunk, and it allowed dairy consumption to . take place. The amount of lactose adults with intolerance can cope with in a day. It's equivalent to a glass of milk . But for people like me, it doesn't really matter what . came first. I want to know the health implications. After all, it's . drummed into us from an early age that milk is  an essential part of our . diet, chiefly because all that calcium is good for our bones. 'There . are no serious health consequences of being lactose intolerant,' says . Professor John Mayberry, a gastroenterologist at the University . Hospitals of Leicester, 'and you should remember that for much of the . world it's quite normal. There's no increased risk of any diseases.' You . should also remember milk does not have a monopoly on  calcium, which . is found in broccoli,  cabbage, soya beans and nuts. And just because . you are lactose intolerant, it does not mean you have to give up cheese, . as the fermentation process significantly reduces lactose levels. Although . Professor  Mayberry confirms that my self-diagnosis is perfectly valid . and safe, there are more medically rigorous tests you can take should . you suspect lactose intolerance. 'Potentially, you can submit to a . whole series of investigations,' says Professor Mayberry. 'But the most . simple and least invasive is the hydrogen breath test, in which the . level of hydrogen in your breath is measured after you have drunk some . lactose solution.' The test is done at a hospital and you need a GP referral. Hydrogen . is one of the gases so charmingly emitted by the likes of me after . drinking milk - bacteria in the gut produce hydrogen in reaction to . unabsorbed food, and if your levels of hydrogen are 20 parts per million . higher after drinking the lactose solution, then you're lactose . intolerant. In my experience, that figure seems low. At times, I could have sworn I was expelling pure hydrogen.Another . common test is to measure the levels of glucose in your blood after . drinking lactose. The lactase enzyme breaks down lactose into glucose - . so if your glucose either rises slowly, or not at all after drinking . lactose, it's a sign of lactose intolerance. Guy has enough lactase in his small intestine to be able to cope with milk in tea . Again, this hospital test needs a referral from your GP. Although . Professor Mayberry's words are reassuring, for some, a lactose . intolerance can actually be a symptom of something more serious. A . deficiency of lactase can be caused by inflammatory bowel diseases such . as Crohn's and ulcerative colitis, but as these also present other more . serious symptoms such as weight loss, bleeding and mucus, a diagnosis of . lactose intolerance alone is no reason to be alarmed. But those who . smugly think they can consume lactose for the rest of their lives . should also think again. 'Lactase starts to diminish in a lot of people . in their 60s and 70s,' says Professor Mayberry, 'which is why older . people find they cannot eat certain food any more. 'Lactose isn't just present in milk, but it's used in all sorts of foods, such as whitener in loaves of bread.' I've . now started to reintroduce milk in a small way. I now take it in tea . and coffee, and like many with lactose intolerance, I have just enough . lactase in my small intestine to be able to cope with these amounts. For . the time being, I appear not to have passed on my intolerance to my . children, who are both nearly in double figures, and seem able to drink . milk with impunity. But as soon as one of them emits a tell-tale burp, I'll snatch the glass, and tell them to leave the rest of the herd.","For 3 million lactose intolerant Britons a glass of milk it is not welcome .
But a genetic mutation in the majority means they can enjoy it for years ."
"By . Chloe Lambert . PUBLISHED: . 18:54 EST, 10 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 18:56 EST, 10 March 2014 . Alison Glenn has Trigeminal neuralgia, a condition causing extreme facial pain . Alison Glenn was enjoying a meal with friends when she first felt the pain in the right side of her jaw. 'It was a gradual thing, and I thought it must be toothache, so I made an appointment with my dentist a few days later. He thought it was a filling that needed changing,' says Alison, 53, who lives in Cambridgeshire with her husband, Nigel, a software architect, and their three children. 'He replaced the filling and said the pain should start to settle, but it didn't. 'I went back about a week later and this time he thought the tooth might be infected, and so decided to do root canal treatment on it.' Root canal involves opening the tooth to remove bacteria from the soft tissue inside, and then filling the root of the tooth. It is notoriously uncomfortable and can take several hours - but for Alison it made things worse. 'The pain became extreme. I was having difficulty talking or opening my mouth and painkillers didn't touch it,' she says. The problem was, there was nothing wrong with Alison's teeth. In fact, she had trigeminal neuralgia, a condition where the trigeminal nerve - which runs through the face and sends pain messages to the brain - becomes damaged. Trigeminal neuralgia affects some 19,000 people in the UK and is most common in the over-50s. It causes bouts of severe facial pain, and as the condition is still not well known, these are often mistaken for dental problems with disastrous results. Many patients endure years of unnecessary dental work - some patients have even had all their teeth removed. It took 2½ years - and an astonishing four sessions of needless root canal treatment on different teeth - before Alison was given the correct diagnosis. Not only is trigeminal neuralgia often slow to be picked up, it's thought to be one of the most painful conditions known to medicine. It's even been called the 'suicide disease', because patients can begin to feel suicidal, so debilitating are the symptoms. Many sufferers describe the pain as like an electric shock, but for Alison it felt 'like a knife stabbing into my jaw'. GP prescribed carbamazepine, an anti-convulsant that helps with nerve pain, and it got things under control . The condition causes faulty pain messages to be sent, especially when the face is touched. The lightest touch - even a hair brushing against the skin or a gust of wind - can trigger the excruciating feeling, although it can also happen spontaneously. The neuralgia tends to strike for just a few seconds or minutes. 'I could be sitting talking to a friend and the next minute be in tears with the pain,' says Alison.Eating became difficult, too. 'After the first root canal treatment, I couldn't even put a cup to my mouth,' Alison recalls. 'At one point I was having soup through a straw. I lost about 2st in weight over a period of a few months because eating anything would set it off.' She saw her GP who prescribed carbamazepine, an anti-convulsant that helps with nerve pain, and that gradually got things under control. She also learned to eat on the left side of her mouth, avoided very crunchy foods like apples, and slowly regained some weight. But as various specialists struggled to work out what was causing the problem, Alison's ability to cope with the outside world started to shrink. 'I couldn't go out in cold weather or wind, as that would set it off; sometimes even the vibration of walking on a gravel path would do it. I couldn't go out to eat and was always worried that if I did go out I would have an attack, so I became very isolated. Even the fear of it happening was enough to set it off.' Alison also hated the side-effects of her medication. 'It left me drowsy and wanting to sleep all the time. As soon as I had it under control I'd try to reduce the quantity, but if I didn't get it right the pain kicked in again.' The neuralgia also placed a strain on  her family. 'They were extremely worried about me - my life had completely changed and there was nothing they could do. My daughter recently admitted it was really frightening to see me in such pain.' Eventually, in late 2010 her dentist referred her to the University College London Eastman Dental Institute where she saw Professor Joanna Zakrzewska, a leading expert in trigeminal neuralgia. Alison was referred for an MRI scan on her head which confirmed the trigeminal nerve was being compressed . 'People had mentioned trigeminal neuralgia before but for some reason my dentist didn't believe that was what I had,' says Alison. 'After examining me,  Professor Zakrzewska knew immediately that was it. It was such a relief to talk to someone who understood totally what I was going through.' There are two trigeminal nerves, one on each side of the face and each with branches that run around the eye, forehead, cheek, nose, jaw and mouth. Trigeminal neuralgia seems to occur when the myelin - the material that insulates nerves - wears  away, especially at the point where the nerve  enters the brain, says Professor Zakrzewska. 'All sensation is felt in the brain and interpreted in the brain,' she explains. We think when the myelin is lost, there's some cross circuit between the nerves, so a normal sensation like touch is wrongly interpreted by the brain as pain. 'It's an extremely severe pain, and although it lasts for only a few seconds it can feel continuous because it keeps happening in quick succession.' People with multiple sclerosis are at raised risk of trigeminal neuralgia, as this condition causes the degeneration of myelin. However most cases occur in otherwise healthy people due to a blood vessel pressing against the trigeminal nerve, wearing away the protective surrounding layer. It's still not clear why this should happen in some people. The condition tends to be diagnosed over the age of 50 (although it has been seen in younger people, and even in children) and Professor Zakrzewska speculates it may be a disease associated with ageing. And some studies have linked trigeminal neuralgia with high blood pressure. 'It could be that hypertension causes greater pressure in the blood vessel next to the trigeminal nerve,' she says. However there are still many unanswered questions surrounding the condition. 'When you operate to move the blood vessel out of the way, 70 per cent of patients will be pain free, but not all of them,' says  Professor Zakrzewska. 'Also, if you scanned the brains of the whole population, you'd see around 15 per cent of people have this blood vessel next to the nerve, but nowhere near that number have trigeminal neuralgia.' Her team now wants to run genetic studies to see if this has a role. Awareness . of trigeminal neuralgia is improving, but Jillie Abbott, of the . Trigeminal Neuralgia Association, says that misdiagnosis is still a huge . issue. 'The stories we . hear really are quite horrifying. Many people have teeth removed or root . canal treatment; we have heard from people who have had all their teeth . out, though that's unusual.' After . seeing Professor Zakrzewska, Alison was referred for an MRI scan on her . head which confirmed the trigeminal nerve was being compressed. The number of people who take time off work for dental problems each year . 'I'd had an MRI two years before, but it had shown nothing, apart from ruling out a tumour or multiple sclerosis. 'This time they knew what they were looking for. The neurosurgeon said it clearly picked up the blood vessel pressing on the nerve, and so I'd be a good candidate for surgery.' Six months later, in the summer of 2011, she had the two-hour procedure. Surgeons made an incision just behind the ear and drilled through the skull to reach the trigeminal nerve. They then placed a pad made from Teflon fibres next to the blood vessel, to stop it pressing against the nerve, so allowing the myelin to regenerate. Alison recovered in hospital for four days before going home. 'It was fantastic,' she says. 'It took me a long time to be confident again about things like eating and exercising, because I was so scared of setting it off again. 'But, touch wood, I've been free of pain ever since then.' Surgery, which is normally suggested only after anticonvulsants have been tried, can be successful for many but in some people the neuralgia can return. In this instance, they may be tried on anti-convulsants again, or they may be offered ablation therapy, where heat or radiation is used to destroy part of the trigeminal nerve itself. This carries a risk of long-term numbness in the face, but can provide relief from the pain for about four years. Ablation therapy may also be offered to the minority of people with trigeminal neuralgia where there is no sign the nerve is being pushed against by a blood vessel. Alison Glenn is crossing her fingers she will remain pain free. 'I consider myself lucky,' she says. 'And I appreciate things now - walking in the wind and seeing friends. But, of course, I do look back and think: “Did I really need to have all that root canal treatment?” ' Contact the Trigeminal Neuralgia Association UK on  01883 370 214 or at tna.org.uk .","Alison Glenn, 53, from Cambridgeshire, had severe pain in her jaw .

As women hit their half century, skin begins to sag, fine lines appear and confidence levels often drop as a result. But how do you beat the wrinkles and give your skin a surge of life without turning to plastic surgery? One beauty company thinks it has the answer to help diminish the signs of mature skin by combating the signs of menopause. The new anti-ageing cream? Rodial has unveiled Cougar Collection - a range of skin creams designed to beat wrinkles by combatting the signs of menopause on the skin . The Rodial Cougar Collection range claims to target the signs of menopause, which founders say requires particular attention beyond regular anti-ageing needs. The beauty brand, favoured by the likes of Jessica Biel and Lady Gaga, has developed a capsule range of three products to respond to the direct effects hormonal change can have on the skin using ingredients that are specific to helping skin control functions lost as we age. Speaking about her brainchild, which goes on sale in Harrods today and is priced between £75-£150, founder of Rodial, Maria Hatzistefanis, said: 'One . side-effect of menopause is a reduction of estrogen production, . resulting in a loss of supportive function below the skin allowing . sagging wrinkles to appear with loss of mobility, creating a ""crepy"" texture', explains Maria. 'Protein synthesis, particularly that . of collagen and elastin, are partially controlled by estrogens. Thus, . during menopause, the lowered estrogen levels result in less production . and repair of collagen and elastin in the dermis of the skin. 'A normal anti-ageing cream . is not going to help when the cause of the problem is a drop in the level of . hormones. We are addressing the cause of the problem and expecting a . better anti-ageing result as opposed to using a conventional . anti-ageing product.' How does it work? Menopause causes a reduction of estrogen production, resulting in a loss of supportive function below the skin allowing sagging wrinkles to appear with loss of mobility, creating a crepy texture, which the cream claims to combat . The secret ingredient in the trio of creams - one for face, one for body and one serum,  is wild yam, which the brand say has been used as a natural alternative supplement to estrogen therapy for years. A study by Komesaroff et al, entitled Effects of wild yam extract on menopausal symptoms, lipids and sex hormones in healthy menopausal women, found that that short-term treatment with topical wild yam extract in women suffering from menopausal symptoms left them free of side-effects. Explaining . this ingredient choice, Maria said: 'The drop in oestrogen that happens . from the age of 35 onwards is a major cause of skin ageing. My theory . is that if you can trick the skin into thinking that hormones are back . to the pre-35 levels, the ageing process can be reversed. Secret ingredient: The range is packed with wild yam, which the brand say has been used as a natural alternative supplement to estrogen therapy . 'By . having the skin believe it's receiving more estrogen from the natural . alternative wild yam, it  produces more collagen.' It . is also packed with black cohosh, which claims to help control sebum . production that can be a side-effect of hormonal change on the skin. 'Combined with black cohosh, which helps control sebum . production, the skin is significantly and cosmetically enhanced during . and post menopause,' said Maria. This . isn't the first time that Rodial has developed a product like this, a . few years ago the company brought out the Bee Venom range, which was used cosmetically to 'fool' the skin into thinking it had been lightly stung with the toxin melittin. This . causes the body to direct blood towards the area and stimulates the . production of the naturally-occurring chemicals collagen and elastin. Maria concluded: 'When we started developing a range for . mature skin, we wanted to get the message across that when you reach . your 50s, 60s and beyond, this is the time to celebrate your life, your . skin and your body. 'To . us the word ""cougar"" is a term that has nothing to do with a younger . boyfriend and everything to do with taking control of your life and . being the best that you can be. We want to empower women, offer them the . best skincare and a positive message about this beautiful time in their . lives.'","The Rodial Cougar Collection combats effects of menopause on skin .

She's a teeny 5ft 2in, is very often mahogany thanks to her love  of fake tan, and has a fringe so long she can barely see through it. As for her love of eyeliner; she makes the Middleton ladies look restrained. And while most female presenters sashay down the red carpet perfectly coiffed in revealing designer dresses, well, Claudia's a bit different there too. At the BAFTAs last month she attracted almost as much attention as Angelina Jolie, but not necessarily for the right reasons. Most people were asking if she did her make-up in the dark. The answer is not quite in the dark, but in the back of a cab on the way to the event. The result was wonky, smudged eyeliner that snaked half-way down her cheek. 'Oh, I've lost my make-up artist so much work,' she groans, head in her hands. What, she actually had a make-up artist that day? 'Oh no, not for the BAFTAs,' she laughs. 'Only for when I'm working. Having one for the BAFTAs would feel ridiculous, very J-Lo. Normally if I'm at an event and there are superstars there no one gives a monkey's what I'm wearing. At least, not unless my make-up is magnificently bad.' She says that on the day of the BAFTAs she got dressed in a hurry and did her eyeliner 'blind' in the cab. When she glanced in her compact mirror she was 'genuinely delighted' as she's always liked a bit of smudge. 'Only this time I may have overdone it.' Being a non-model in a world full  of them, Claudia's safety mechanism is to always look the same and not compare herself - particularly to her Strictly Come Dancing co-star Tess Daly. 'I'm a weird, dark-haired, orange person,' she says. 'Tess is stunning, the most beautiful creature on Earth. We're so different I can't even try to compare us. If I did I'd never leave the house. I've never really experimented with my looks but whatever experimentation there was has long gone. Orange skin, white lips, smudged eye-make-up and a fringe make me happy. So I'm going with that.' If people have strong opinions about the eye-liner it's nothing compared with the fuss about the fringe. It hit its height last year when she appeared on the first series of reality show The Great British Sewing Bee and it became known as the most irritating fringe on TV. There was even a Twitter account dedicated to it. At the BAFTAs last month Claudia was continually asked if she'd put her makeup on in the dark...turns out she'd put it on in a taxi . Claudia, 42, reveals that before filming started on this year's show a producer told her she needed to get it cut. 'I was properly told to cut it,' she whispers huskily. 'They said, “This is getting ridiculous.”' Who said? 'I'd better not tell you because then I'd definitely lose my job, but they said, “I'm not sure what point you're trying to make with it.” So I squeaked, “I'm not trying to make a point.” So they said, “Good. Cut it.”' But isn't it nicer to be able to actually see? 'Well I've never been able to see, I've had a gazillion operations on my eyes anyway (she's severely short-sighted and has had laser treatment to improve her vision). But I do live in a strange paradox. 'My daughter has a fringe and I'm obsessed with cutting it so she can see when she goes to school. Mine's getting longer while hers is above her eyebrows. I feel naked if it's too short and, trust me, no one would want to see my forehead. You would be physically sick. At Radio 2 recently I saw Chrissie Hynde from The Pretenders in reception and her fringe swept down to her chin. She had to part it to talk to people. That's where I'll end up, I hope. I won't be able to do that in TV, but in life I hope that's where I'll be.' When presenting The Great British Sewing Bee, Claudia was told to cut her fringe as it was 'getting ridiculous' For now Claudia's so busy her fringe will have to stay above her eyes. Her most high-profile role is presenting Strictly's Sunday night results show and filling in for Bruce Forsyth if he takes time off. She insists she could never see herself filling his shoes for good though. 'Bruce will definitely be back. I'd never want to take over from him. I'd be terrified.' She's also presenting the second series of Sewing Bee, has her arts show on Radio 2 and presents Film 2014. And next Friday she'll be one of the main anchors for Sport Relief. She says she was amazed at the sporting antics of her friend Davina McCall, who  did a 500-mile triathlon for the charity. 'I was aghast. Although I'd love to do anything I can for this charity - they astound me with what they do - I've never done any exercise so I couldn't do that.' 'I've exceeded all my ambitions. All my jobs are dream jobs.' As well as showing us Davina's trials, the fundraising marathon will include a special edition of Only Fools And Horses starring David Beckham and there'll be a Strictly Come Dancing special featuring four paralympians. Meanwhile two celebrity teams, headed by Olympic champ Lord Coe and comedian John Bishop, will compete in sporting challenges at the Olympic Park live on the show. The teams, which include Andrew Flintoff, Nick Grimshaw, Olly Murs and Sally Phillips, will perform events such as rhythmic gymnastics, track cycling and swimming. Expect mishaps. 'We've got lots of brilliant people also hosting, like Clare Balding and Gabby Logan and Gary Lineker as well as Davina, so I'm just going to take my cue from them,' insists Claudia. 'That's the key. Follow them.' She's terribly self-effacing when she talks; it's hard to know how much she means it. A Cambridge graduate whose mother Eve Pollard was a Fleet Street editor and father Barry Winkleman a publisher, she says while she was ambitious once, she isn't any more. Claudia with her Strictly Come Dancing Colleague, Tess Daly, who she describes as 'the most beautiful person in the world' 'I've exceeded all my ambitions. All my jobs are dream jobs.' In the past her work schedule - and its clash with that of her husband, film producer Kris Thykier - led to problems between them, but they seem to have things sorted now. She gave up Strictly's companion evening show It Takes Two so she could be at home more for their children, Jake, ten, Matilda, seven, and Arthur, two. And in the summer the family decamped for nine weeks to Brazil where Kris was making his latest movie Trash, due out this year. Not working for those weeks made her realise just how much she loved her job; that it wasn't just to keep the kids in Lego. 'I'd never want to do too much because things suffer at home but I also know now that I'd be rubbish if I did nothing. When I was with the kids all the time things felt hectic and I got a bit screechy. I used to say to my son when he was young that I had to work to buy bananas. One evening I was leaving and he was upset and said, “Mummy, you don't have to go, we've got bananas.” So I told him the truth; I like working. I like being with people and using my brain.' Kris, who produced One Chance, last year's film about Britain's Got Talent winner Paul Potts, used to be known as a man-about-town while Claudia's always been a homebody ('I went to a nightclub once, and I thought it was too noisy and a fire hazard'). Now he seems tamed. While she was at the BAFTAs, he was taking the children dry-slope skiing. 'I love him so much,' she says with a fond smile. 'He's obsessed with teaching our kids to ski even though neither of us has done it. He's adorable.' Her perfect weekend would be spent 'lolloping' with the family. 'I love being inside,' she says. 'If I can get my daughter sewing with me - nothing more than a few cuffs because if you think my eyeliner's wonky, you should see my sewing - and the baby's wandering around trying to sit on the kitten and my big son's reading on the sofa with his dad, I'm in heaven. 'I was born this dull,' she adds. 'But the wild years are coming. I love getting older and when I'm 62 I plan to be wearing a kaftan. I'll have eyeliner all over my face and my fringe will be down to my waist. I'll go nuts.' Sport Relief, Friday, 7pm, BBC1.","The 5ft 2 presenter discusses the stick she gets for her beauty choices .

We live in a materialistic world where glossy celebrities adorn magazine covers and looking picture-perfect for social media selfies is all the rage. So the latest stats, highlighting that the average age girls start wearing make-up has dropped to 11-years-old, may not come as a surprise. Girls are now wearing cosmetics over three years earlier than they did back in the previous decade, according to the latest research. Shocking: A new survey reveals that girls as young as eleven are now using make-up to glam up like their favourite reality TV stars . Previously pre-teen girls were unlikely to be experimenting with cosmetics but nowadays it is seen to be the norm for girls as young as 11 to be wearing some form of make-up. Peer group pressure on social media and at school, as well as trying to emulate girls on reality shows like TOWIE's Sam and Billie Faiers, are key drivers for the drop in age. The survey found that nearly two thirds (61 per cent) of the women questioned said girls were at least three years younger in starting to use make-up than their generation were, and now pre-teens using cosmetics was the norm. They said that the average age of starting to wear make-up was now just over 11-years-old (11.13 years) and the vast majority of women (89 per cent) did not think this was a good thing. Pressure: Peer group pressure on social media and at school, and trying to emulate girls on reality shows like TOWIE's Sam and Billie Faiers are key drivers for the drop in age, according to the survey . They said that girls should wait till they reach 14 to wear foundation, around 13 years old to wear eye make-up, and 12 to wear lip gloss. Over 89 per cent of women said under 13s should not wear make-up unless it was a very rare special occasion - only once or twice a year at most. Go natural: Over 89 per cent of women said under 13s should not wear make-up unless it was a very rare special occasion - only once or twice a year at most . A spokesperson for Escentual.com, who commissioned the survey, said: 'Most women were against pre-teen girls using make-up regularly but said they realised that the majority of under 13s were doing it anyway. 'They said the average age of starting to use make-up had dropped significantly in recent years and that they regularly saw girls as young as 11 wearing cosmetics. 'They were concerned that these pre-teen girls might develop an unhealthy obsession with their appearance - over 62 per cent thought this was the biggest risk from younger girls starting to use make-up. 'Most women thought it was acceptable for girls to start using some make-up by 13, and that by 15 it was acceptable for girls to be wearing make-up regularly in public.' The women surveyed said the key drivers for the drop in age was put down to peer group pressure at school (34 per cent) and the desire to feel more grown-up (37 per cent), but also reality TV shows like TOWIE were blamed for girls wanting to grow up too fast.

At an age when many men are worried about losing their hair, 53-year-old Keith Yexley noticed that he was gaining it - just in all the wrong places. 'Like most men, as I've got older I've found hair sprouting out of places I'd prefer it not to, like my nose, ears and the eyebrows,' says Keith, who runs a marketing company in Hitchin, Herts. 'In particular, my eyebrows have started getting very long, thick and bushy and sticking up like antennas, in a Mr Spock from Star Trek way. It's a standing joke in my house when they get out of control: ""Put your antennas down, Keith,"" they say.' No pain, no gain: Keith Yexley having his eyebrows shaped by Kerie Hoy at her Salon in Hitchin . While many men might simply put up with the jibes, Keith, a married father of four, decided to do something about it. He is among a growing number of men who are paying to have their eyebrows waxed or threaded to keep them groomed. 'Since opening in 2004, we have noticed a consistent year-on-year increase in men's waxing and eyebrow shaping and we currently perform around 30 a week,' says Ray Khandpur of male grooming salon Drakes of London. 'In fact, eyebrow waxing has now become our second most popular service after back waxing. We find that most gents like to combine an eyebrow ""tidy"" with a haircut. Most want the ""just noticeable"" look, so that there are cleaner lines and no mono-brow but it is not so obvious. 'More and more of our younger clients are opting for this whereas the over-30s are generally talked into it by their wives.' Wife approves: Keith, before, left, and after, right, his eyebrow treatment . This was certainly the case for Keith. 'I probably wouldn't have had my eyebrows done if my wife Louise hadn't moaned at me to do something about them,' he says. 'I used to just wet my finger and smooth them down. Sometimes, if they got really long, I'd sit in the car and yank them out with my fingers. It drove her mad. 'I was having a meeting in the local salon when the beautician said to me: ""I'd love to get my hands on your eyebrows."" 'Louise and I go to spas sometimes for weekend breaks and I enjoy being pampered, having manicures and massages. I like taking care of myself so it wasn't a big deal to try another treatment.' Keith tried the Billion Dollar Brow treatment, which combines waxing, threading and cutting, to tackle his bushy brows. 'I'm not particularly vain. But I think you should do whatever you can to make yourself look as . tidy as possible and to keep up with the times' 'I was a bit nervous that it would hurt, but it wasn't too bad. I also worried that they'd look too groomed, but Keri, the beautician promised that they'd still look natural and masculine. 'When I got home, Louise was over the moon and I was really pleased with the result - they were a lot neater but not unnatural looking. They have kept their shape well, too.' Keith now plans to keep up his new beauty regime, despite the teasing from his friends on his Saturday football team. 'I did make the mistake of telling a few of the guys that I'd had my eyebrows done. I got a bit of stick for that - I think they called me a girl. But quite a few of them have treatments, like manicures, too - they just don't tell anyone.' TalkSport presenter Geoff Peters, 40, embraced a rigorous eyebrow waxing regime following a radical makeover - and hasn't looked back. Beauty indulgence: Oliver spends up to £10 a time on threading appointments at an Indian pop-up stand in a shopping centre near his home . 'When I turned 30, I decided to change my lifestyle completely, losing four stone in a year and shaving my head,' says Geoff, from Enderby, Leicestershire. 'I began having treatments to improve my appearance and make me feel better about myself. I also started shaving my chest and ""manscaping"" - meaning grooming the hair down below. 'One day, I was having a back wax when the beautician asked if I'd thought about having my eyebrows tidied up. I thought, ""why not"" - I'm having other treatments such as a back wax, pedicure and manicure. I've now been having it done every four to six weeks for the past five years. 'They wax in between and above my brows, and then pluck out the stray hairs underneath and to the sides, and trim the length with scissors.' Geoff spends up to £15 a time on ""natural-looking"" eyebrow shaping. 'I'm not particularly vain,' he says. 'But I think you should do whatever you can to make yourself look as tidy as possible and to keep up with the times. I have them done at the same time as my other treatments.' 'Of all the treatments I've ever had, having my eyebrows done is the most painful. It's over quickly, but it does hurt a lot.' Groomed: Oliver disliked his 'caterpillar' brow, left, but threading had made them neater, right . 'Generally, people don't tend to notice or mention it - especially as I paint my toenails pink every summer for four months to raise awareness of breast cancer. I get odd looks for that.' Like Keith, Geoff has taken a ribbing from his mates for his beauty habits, but says he knows plenty of men who indulge in a spot of grooming. 'It's become much more acceptable for men to have treatments and care about their appearance. Twenty years ago men wouldn’t even wear moisturiser. I definitely see more blokes in the salon than I used to. 'I definitely think I look better than I did ten years ago, and I feel better, too. Having my eyebrows waxed is just part of my routine now, it feels natural. And my ex-girlfriends have appreciated it.' Having to endure daily jokes from his then girlfriend about his ""caterpillar monobrow"" prompted Oliver Sadie, 35, to reach for the tweezers. The number of hairs in an eyebrow can vary wildly, from as few as 250 to as many as 500 . 'Even though I've had bushy brows since childhood - a family trait handed down from my father's side - I'd never been teased or conscious of them until my mid-20s,' says Oliver, who works in finance and also composes music for films and television. 'It was only by accident that I eventually started having them threaded ten years ago after happening across a threading salon in Camden one day. 'Watching on as someone had their brows done, I reasoned that it looked a lot easier and quicker than messing about with tweezers. 'Thankfully it wasn't painful, just a spiky tingling sensation, and I was amazed at the difference well groomed brows made to my overall appearance. My girlfriend was suitably impressed. Subsequent girlfriends have universally approved and haven't made a fuss of my metrosexuality.' Now Oliver, a father of four who is separated from his wife, spends up to £10 a time on threading appointments at an Indian pop-up stand in a shopping centre near his home in Maidenhead, Berkshire. 'I'm always careful to tell whoever's doing the job not to take too much hair away and to leave a natural line that doesn't look cosmetic. 'I don't want my brows to look effeminate or to be left so thin that I'd need to pencil them in. I just want them to look neat.' Though he takes pride in his appearance, Oliver doesn't talk about his grooming habits with his friends. 'I'm not a vain, gym buff type of man but I like a clean shave - often at the barber's - and a good haircut. I wear sharp, tailored suits and crisp shirts, and ensure that I keep my nails neat. 'Even now, there's still a sexuality stigma attached to many aspects of male grooming. My male friends don't know that I groom to this degree so I'm a little worried that when they read this they will respond in the stereotypical macho way. 'Other than my brows, I'm very happy being hirsute - you should see my toes!'","Geoff Peters, 40, spends up to £15 a time on eyebrow shaping .

"PUBLISHED: . 18:00 EST, 12 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 13:32 EST, 13 March 2014 . When you’ve had ‘one of those days’, nothing beats a plate of stodge for momentary — if sinful — release from it all. The other day, when I met my friend Bernette for lunch, work and children had pushed me to hair-tearing point — but I knew it could all be solved by one of those giant toasties with rivers of melted cheddar oozing from hunks of white bread. So why then, did I find myself ordering an abstemious tuna salad instead? I’m certainly not worried about my figure — I’m a very trim size ten — I just feel bad for Bernette, who, at a size 16/18, constantly battles the proverbial bulge. Angela (left) feels bad about ordering fatty food around her size 16/18 friend, Bernette (right) It would be unfair to sit there, knee-deep in calories, when she tries to watch what she eats. Talk about rubbing her face in the fact I can eat whatever I want. Not that this kind of abstinence isn’t frustrating. Sometimes I feel like shouting: ‘So you’re overweight — that’s your problem, not mine!’ This is the harsh truth about being a skinny minnie with fat friends. You are forever tiptoeing around the elephant in the room — their weight. It may sound callous, but when your pals are podgy they cast a giant shadow over your every move when you’re with them. Of course there will be many on the other side of the fence who say their plight is far worse: having to watch as stick insects around them devour chocolates and then slither into slinky dresses. There may even be some who wonder if I don’t protest too much. Surely, there’s a tiny part of me that enjoys the fact that flabby friends inevitably emphasise your own svelte figure? I can assure you I never feel this way. True friendship is a precious thing and I would never regard my mates as strategically positioned foils to shine a light on myself. Although I know there are those who do: apparently one in three British women recently admitted they would choose a heavier friend as their bridesmaid to make them look comparatively trimmer on their wedding day. As for me, thanks to a fast metabolism, genetic good fortune and a love of brisk walking and swimming, I rarely put on weight. In fact, at nine-and-a-half stone, I am lighter than I was when I got married 23 years ago. That’s not to say there haven’t been times when a few pounds have crept up on me, such as after over-indulging on holiday. But I just under-indulge when I get back and make sure I exercise. Of course I know it’s not so simple for some. Many have a compulsive relationship with food and I feel for them, I really do. That’s not to say my gut reaction isn’t to judge when I see a porky stranger tucking into a cheeseburger and chips on the train. It’s hard to resist the urge to go over and say: ‘Why are you doing this to yourself?’ 'Although Bernette (right) appreciated my attempts at sensitivity, it upset her more to think that I couldn’t be myself around her"" says Angela (left) Of course it’s different with friends: judgment is replaced by concern, fear of saying the wrong thing. A few weeks ago, I met a fairly portly work friend after a half-term trip to Athens. We shared anecdotes about my holiday but just as I was about to marvel that my jeans felt slightly tight, I bit my tongue. How could I share this with a woman who hasn’t been inside a pair of denims since the turn of the millennium? Instead I quickly changed the subject because having friends who are overweight, makes you feel relentlessly self-conscious. I’m certainly not the only one who feels like this. In fact there is a collective paranoia about causing offence to those larger than ourselves. Take the fact teachers and health professionals are forbidden from broaching a dangerously obese child’s size head on: ‘obese’ is a banned term, as is ‘fat’. No wonder the rest of us feel like we’re treading on eggshells. Sometimes, my discomfort around my bigger friends is cringe-worthy: take the time Bernette spotted me wearing a figure-hugging dress at a wedding and swamped me with compliments. My response? Instead of revelling in her kind words, I did what I always do: I either deflect (‘My shoes are absolutely killing me!’) or attempt humour (‘You think I look slim? Forget it. Look at her: I’ve seen pipe cleaners with more meat.’). I can’t just enjoy a nice comment; I have to bat it away so as not to make the friend feel bad about herself. Up to 64 per cent of British adults are classed as being overweight or obese . And when it comes to paying them a genuine compliment you’re really in a sticky situation. Bernette always looks super smart and can put together flattering outfits with panache — ie she knows how to emphasise her pretty face and detract from her figure. The other week I heard someone say to her: ‘You always know how to dress . . .’ the unspoken part of the sentence being ‘for your size’. Most of the time, I just try not to talk about fashion in front of anyone who is manifestly big. And if the conversation drifts towards new trends, I’ll do my best to change the subject — perhaps asking for recipe ideas — so that we can talk about something that is less sensitive and more interesting for them. It’s very draining. Even worse, though, are the shopping trips with oversized pals. Recently, I arranged a day out with an old school friend  I hadn’t seen in years. I was going to a 40th birthday party that weekend so she said she would help me pick something glam  to wear. But it turned out she’d gained at least a stone-and-a-half. So I didn’t have the gall to try anything on in front of her, instead veering towards the kaftan section, saying I wanted one for my summer holiday. It was January. I’m ashamed to confess that I made a mental note never to go shopping with her — or anyone over a size 10 — again. So what does Bernette make of all this? She’s tried every diet under the sun including having a gastric band fitted. Sadly, it didn’t work. Although she had to avoid heavy meals, it didn’t address her mindset — her sweet tooth — and so she still manages to eat the hot chocolates and ice cream. Sometimes Angela (pictured) feels like shouting: 'So you're overweight - that's your problem, not mine!' Despite all this, she has never shown a sliver of jealousy that I am thinner than her. Perhaps it serves me right that when she sat down to lunch with me the other day, she picked up on the real reason for my choice of a tuna salad. She wrested the fork from my hand and declared: ‘Angela, for goodness sake, just order what you want. I know what you’re up to and it doesn’t help. I’m overweight. Live with it. I know I do.’ Then it all came tumbling out. Although Bernette appreciated my attempts at sensitivity, it upset her more to think that I couldn’t be myself around her. What’s more, she felt patronised and belittled when thin friends went to great lengths to avoid anything that acknowledged a disparity between our waistlines. She pointed out that now she was a mother-of-three and a grandmother-of-four, she was big enough — no pun intended — to cope with the fact that she had friends who were thinner. She also reminded me that she has experienced many highs and lows and reached a point in her life where she could cope with just about anything. ‘Anyway,’ she added, ‘even if you do eat that pathetic salad, and continue to avoid shopping with me, it won’t make me any thinner. So stop pussy-footing around.’ I was dumbfounded and felt a rush of scarlet shame. I had been a flaky do-gooder who , compelled by a misguided niceness, had given little thought to the transparency of my actions. The only words I could find were: ‘I’m so, so sorry.’ Right then and there I vowed never again to edit my behaviour around my hugely wise, big-hearted and, yes, overweight friends. And when Bernette summoned the waitress and ordered a cream cake that afternoon, I put my hand on her arm and said: ‘You’d better make that two.’","Angela often feels like she can't eat what she wants in front of fat friends .

But new research suggests millions of Britons are risking illness because they do not replace their pillows and duvet as often as they should. The study revealed that the average person uses their pillows for a year longer than is recommended and that they use the same duvet for two years longer than they should. Some 82 per cent of Britons don't know that pillows should be replaced every two years and duvets, every five . The poll of nearly 2,200 men and women over the age of 18 found that 82 per cent of people do not know how often they should replace their pillows and duvet. According to the Sleep Council, pillows should be replaced every two years and duvets should be thrown away after five years. But, a study by Ergoflex UK showed that the average Briton uses a pillow for 3.2 years and a duvet for 7.6 years. As a result, experts say they are risking neck problems caused by sleeping without enough head and neck support. They are also at risk of health problems associated with dust mite infestations. The survey revealed 57 per cent of people only replace their bedding when it feels like it is wearing thin. Some 46 per cent say they replace it when they feel like it has been too long since they last changed their bedding. By not replacing their pillows, people are putting themselves at risk of sleeping with insufficient neck and head support . Others said they throw out their bedding when they start to struggle to sleep or to get comfortable. For 21 per cent of people it is all about cost – they only buy new bedding when there is a sale on. While people are clueless about how often they should change their bedding, most are aware that pillows should be changed more often than duvets. According to the survey, 61 per cent of people replace their pillows more frequently because they are aware of the hygiene issues associated with not doing so. Jed MacEwan, Managing Director of www.Ergoflex.co.uk, said: ‘We can’t quite believe that 82 per cent of Britons don’t know the recommended time periods which dictate when you should replace your bedding, not to mention that the average Briton uses their pillows and duvet for between one and two years longer than they should. ‘Not only are they increasing their chances of having restless nights, they’re also risking sustained periods of sleeping without an adequate level of support to the neck and head, along with various hygiene problems that may arise from dust mite infestations in older bedding. ‘Independent specialists at the Sleep Council recommend that your mattress should be replaced every seven years, and it’s certainly prudent that duvets and pillows are replaced every five and two years respectively. ‘Of course this is dependent on the quality of the products you buy, and it’s possible to extend the life of your bedding by purchasing protectors. ‘We hope that Britons will look at the results of this study and think long and hard about the various risks they’re posing on themselves by hanging onto their bedding longer than they should – after all it’s a decision that will result in altogether healthier, better quality sleep.’","Pillows should be changed every two years and duvets every five .

With sugar coming under fire for causing obesity and heart disease, many people are looking for an alternative to their breakfast orange juice.

The drink contains a naturally occurring compound called Pinitol - derived from the Asian flower bougainvillea. Pinitol has been shown to help prevent blood sugar spikes . This, it is claimed, can mitigate some of the harmful effects associated with sugar by lowering the blood sugar surges that occur in the body after a person consumes something sweet. Pinitol is registered as a . prescription supplement for the prevention of lifestyle-related diseases . by the Food and Drug Administration. It has also recently been officially approved as an effective natural ingredient for diabetes prevention by South Korea. The Simply Great Drinks Company has created a drink which is says contains a plant compound that counteracts the impact of sugar on the body . The Simply Great Drinks Company - which has created juices with extracts of apple, carob and grape - says the blend was created by a team of bio-medical consultants led by Dr Sepe Sehati. He said: ‘There are a number of modifiable risk factors involved in causing diabetes. ‘A significant one is constant over-stimulation of the complicated mechanism that keeps our blood sugar at the optimum level. ‘When over-stimulated by enormous surges of sugar from sweets and soft drinks the pancreas can gradually become exhausted and the production of insulin diminishes, resulting in diabetes. ‘Pinitol has been shown to significantly lower the area under the plasma glucose response curve and in doing so it lowers the surges of sugar.’ He added: ‘The science has provided compelling evidence that Pinitol can have benefits for treating hyperglycaemia, insulin resistance state and the associated complications. 'Future research is warranted and underway to provide more definitive answers.’ Dr Sehati explained that drinking a 125ml glass of the drink every day for 12 weeks is enough to have the desired effect on blood sugar. He said: ‘The approach is a major breakthrough in tackling some of the harmful effects of sugar in juice and juice drinks.’","A company says it has created a drink that counteracts the effects of sugar .

A hopelessly romantic OCD sufferer says she is unable to meet Mr Right because her illness means she is terrified of love. Heather Bayliss, who also has Asperger syndrome, would like nothing more than to find a man, but says her crippling obsessive compulsive disorder makes it impossible. The 39-year-old dreams of the day she can get her debilitating condition under control and settle down with her ideal partner. Heather Bayliss, 39, has severe obsessive compulsive disorder as well as Asperger syndrome . But dating poses a horrifying number of issues for Ms Bayliss, who hasn’t invited anyone into her flat for more than three years and who only leaves home to shop or visit her mother. She finds it extremely stressful to meet new people and to spend time in public places, and her aversion to eye contact means any first date could be disastrous. Ms Bayliss, from Dorset, said: ‘Any relationship I did have would have to be completely non-contact - an old-fashioned Jane Austen style courtship. ‘My main worry is contamination from other people so there couldn’t be any physical interaction - no hugs, kisses, hand holding - I would need to trust someone before anything like that could happen. ‘If I could meet the right person I would be so happy, but there are just so many extra obstacles that stand in my way because of my OCD and Asperger syndrome. ‘My fear of germs makes it hard for me to go out for food in public too, even something as simple as sitting on a seat in public scares me. Ms Bayliss is desperate to find love but her OCD and Asperger syndrome make this very difficult . Ms Bayliss is terrified of germs so will not hold hands with anyone, kiss or cuddle. She only leaves her home to go to the shops and to visit her mother. She has not invited anyone into her flat for more than three years . ‘And I find social interactions very difficult especially with people I don’t know or have never met before - it’s all very stressful for me. Dating just throws all of these problems at me in one go. ‘As much as I hope I might meet that special someone - I know they would have to accept who I am and be open about my mental health issues.’ Ms Bayliss - who was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome two years ago - believes that it has been subconsciously affecting her relationships her entire life. Obsessive compulsive disorder: . OCD is a condition that causes a person to have obsessive thoughts and to practice compulsive behaviours. They experience unpleasant thoughts which cause anxiety. They also feel compelled to carry out repetitive actions to prevent the unpleasant thoughts coming true. Symptoms can range from mild to severe and treatment options include cognitive behavioural therapy and antidepressants. Some people with OCD also go on to develop depression. Source: NHS Choices . Asperger syndrome: . Asperger syndrome is a form of autism which is a lifelong condition that affects how a person understands the world and relates to other people. People with Asperger syndrome tend to struggle with social interaction but are often very intelligent. They can have difficulty reading facial expressions and tone of voice and can be very literal in their interpretation of language. They often also struggle to make friends and can behave in an inappropriate manner. People with Asperger syndrome also tend to like routine and can have obsessive hobbies. Source: The National Autistic Society . Asperger syndrome is a form of autism which affects how people interact socially and communicate with others - making first dates especially hard for her. She said: ‘I was only diagnosed with Asperger syndrome two years ago so that has affected all of my relationships without me even knowing. ‘But I found it was a huge relief when I was diagnosed. I had always known there was something different and not quite right. ‘I think I can live with the Asperger syndrome, that’s part of who I am. But I can’t live with the OCD being as bad as it is now - it’s pretty much as bad as it gets. ‘People think OCD is all about cleaning, but it’s not. For me, it’s all about fear and fear completely controls my life and I need to do something to make life a bit more liveable. ‘It’s like a snowball, it slowly gathers speed and over the years things have slowly got worse and worse. And the older I’ve got, the more I have found to worry about.’ Ms Bayliss’s extreme OCD has left her terrified of even the most simple interactions leaving her confined to her flat for the majority of the time. The extremity of her condition has increased over the past five years and Ms Bayliss turned to internet dating with the hope of meeting someone to share her life with. Reluctant to give up her search for ‘the one’, she said: ‘I have used internet dating sites in the hope of meeting someone special but it is so hard to know when to be honest with people. ‘I have been open and honest on my profile straight away, and had absolutely no messages from anyone. ‘And I have hidden my mental health . issues from people and we’ve started talking, but as soon as I have been . honest they have dropped off the radar and I never hear from them . again. ‘It’s just so difficult to know when to open up, but I just feel like why should I have to hide who I am?’ Ms Bayliss says she has tried internet dating but that potential partners lose interest in her when they learn about her OCD and Asperger syndrome . Ms Bayliss said: 'As much as I hope I might meet that special someone - I know they would have to accept who I am and be open about my mental health issues' Caroline Hattersley, from the National Autistic Society, said: ‘Asperger syndrome is a form of autism, a lifelong developmental disability that affects how a person communicates with and relates to others. ‘For some people with autism, even ordinary, everyday conversation and social interaction can lead to misunderstandings, confusion or upset, and so negotiating the ‘minefield’ of more intimate relationships can be challenging. ‘The social and communication difficulties that people with autism experience can sometimes make it hard for them to form close friendships and relationships, but the majority would like to have more friends. ‘It’s vital that more is done to support those with the condition so that they do not become isolated, and befriending services and social groups can make a world of difference.’","Heather Bayliss has both OCD and Asperger syndrome .

A mother-of-two discovered she had cancer after her stomach swelled so much she looked nine months pregnant. Wendie Webb, 47, had a 13lb tumour removed from her lower abdomen in a dangerous surgical procedure which doctors feared would kill her. Mrs Webb, who has subsequently battled breast cancer, says the tumour was only discovered after she had colonic irrigation in the hope of reducing bloating so she could fit into her wedding dress. Wendie Webb (right, pictured recently) was diagnosed with ovarian cancer . after her stomach swelled so much she looked nine months pregnant (left). She . also suffered stomach pain, constipation and a feeling of fullness . Mrs Webb, from Flitwick, in Bedfordshire, said: ‘My wedding was just a few months away and my tummy was so huge at the dress fitting that I was worried I wouldn't fit into it. ‘Aside from the swelling I'd had problems for a year, such a constipation, pain, a feeling of fullness and gynaecological problems. In the back of my mind I had wondered whether anything was seriously wrong but I assumed I had simply put on weight or had IBS. ‘The first irrigation didn't reduce the swelling as much as I wanted, so I went back for a second session. That's when technicians asked me to go and see a doctor urgently.’ She attended the A&E department at Bedford hospital where medics were initially baffled. She said: ‘They asked me whether I was . pregnant. By that time, I looked nine months gone. I knew I wasn't . because I'd arranged to be sterilised after having my son. ‘Then . they thought it was a cyst. I was referred to Addenbrooke’s hospital in . Cambridge where a consultant told me I had ovarian cancer. The tumour . was growing at a fast rate.’ Three months before her wedding, Mrs Webb (pictured with her father, Ken, and son, Conor) was told she needed risky life-saving surgery. Doctors suggested that she cancel her wedding but she refused . Mrs Webb (pictured with her father, Ken) says that despite her swollen stomach (pictured) she assumed she either had IBS or that she had just put on some weight . The emergency surgery, which took place in May 2009, required surgeons to cut from Mrs Webb's breast bone to just above her waist. The doctors had little idea about what they would find inside. In the end, Mrs Webb had to have parts of her bowel and bladder removed, and she also underwent a full hysterectomy. Ovarian cancer affects more than 6,500 women in the UK each year. It is the fifth most common cancer among women. It is most common in women who have had the menopause but it can affect women of any age. The symptoms are difficult to recognise, especially in the early stages of the disease, as they can be very similar to those of other, less serious, conditions. The most common early symptoms are persistent bloating, pelvic or abdominal pain, difficulty eating and nausea. Other symptoms can include back pain and needing to pass urine more frequently. Source: NHS Choices . She said: ‘They didn't know what the tumour was attached to or what it was made of. They told me to cancel my wedding, which was just three months away. I was adamant that I didn't - the wedding had to go ahead. ‘But they were keen to make the point that the situation was very serious. My GP sat me down and gently told me to get my affairs in order.’ Mrs Webb, a PR project manager, said breaking the news to her fiancé Andrew, 46, who owns a floor cleaning company, and her children Conor, 16, and Katie, 18, was an emotional experience. She said: ‘It's not a conversation you can ever imagine having. ‘I threw a big barbeque for all my friends and family. I took each of my friends aside for one-to-one conversations and told them what was happening. There were quite a few tears. ‘The surgery was five days later. I remember saying goodbye to Andrew as I was wheeled down to the operating theatre. I wondered whether I would ever see him again.’ But despite her worst fears, Mrs Webb woke up after the surgery, her body free of the 13lb tumour. She said: ‘I phoned everyone from the recovery ward. It felt amazing to be alive.’ On September 4 2009 Mrs Webb was helped to walk down the aisle by her father and son. During surgery Mrs Webb had a 13lb tumour removed as well as part of her stomach, bowel and bladder. She also had a full hysterectomy and doctors said she was lucky to survive the operation . She said: ‘Andrew made a speech thanking . the surgeons, without whom I wouldn't have been there. It was the most . wonderful, emotional, beautiful day.’ Then, in December 2012, after suffering a range of mysterious symptoms, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. She said: ‘I wondered whether I was going through the menopause. My GP had told me that because I'd had the full hysterectomy, I could experience those kinds of symptoms. ‘I had an unusual rash on my nipple and marks on the underside of my breast. I tried to put it out of mind at first but I decided to get it checked out during breast cancer awareness week.’ To combat the cancer Mrs Webb had a mastectomy on her right side. She also had lymph nodes, nerves in her right arm and muscular tissue from her back removed. Mrs Webb (pictured with husband, Andrew, son Conor, 16, and daughter, Katie, 18) has written a blog about her experiences. She says it has been terrible but that some positive things have come from it . Mrs Webb (pictured wearing a wig during her breast cancer treatment) will continue to be closely monitored. She is also due to have reconstructive surgery . She underwent a year of chemotherapy and radiotherapy before she was declared cancer-free in January 2014. She will now be closely monitored and she will shortly return to hospital for reconstructive surgery. She said: ‘I want people who might be facing a cancer diagnosis that if I can get through it, they can too. ‘I've had to be strong. I've had to fight for the sake of my family. But I've been blessed to have such wonderful support, especially from Andrew, who has laughed with me through the darkest moments.’ Three years after her ovarian cancer surgery, Mrs Webb was diagnosed with breast cancer. She had to have a mastectomy, radiotherapy and chemotherapy before being told she was free from the disease . Mrs Webb has found support and inspiration by starting a blog to share her experience with other cancer patients. She said: ‘The experience has made me in a stronger, more positive person. I would never say cancer is a good thing, but there can be positives which come out of it. ‘I've had some dark days, but today I feel great.’ To read Mrs Webb's blog visit woocandoo.blogspot.co.uk .","Wendie Webb became very bloated and suffered constipation and pain .

With prices in excess of Â£5000 for breast augmentation, its no surprise that 43 per cent of British people say they would go abroad in search of cheaper surgery. But it doesn't always have quite the results expected, as Nicole Burnett, 30, a call centre worker from Glasgow, knows only too well. Not only did her quest for cut-price surgery leave her with sagging breasts in two different sizes, it left her with an infection so severe, it continued to rage even after the offending implants had been removed. Upset: Nicole was unhappy with her sagging breasts but a botched boob job abroad proved a catastrophe . Nicole's problems began when she dropped three cup sizes after losing weight and found herself unhappy and embarrassed by her newly diminutive assets. 'I used to go to the gym in padded bras and put sports bras on top of them so people wouldn't notice the sagging in my breasts,' she says. 'The relationship I was in at the time suffered because I wouldn't remove my bra, even when going to bed at night and when I took my bra off, it didn't feel right because my breasts were sagging like an old woman's.' Her solution was implants but with the cost of breast augmentation surgery coming in at Â£5,000 or more, she decided to look abroad for a cheaper surgeon. 'When I looked into having surgery done abroad, I found I could get exactly what I wanted at less cost,' she explains. Heartbreaking: Nicole weeps after being told just how badly damaged her breasts are . She contacted a clinic in Turkey and was initially impressed by both their professionalism and the results of her operation. 'The . company I chose to go with responded to me really quickly and said I would be cared for in a luxury hotel,' she reveals. 'They . told me about the sights, how it was relaxing, how I could have a bit of . a holiday while I was there. They'd give me a 100 per cent guarantee . that I'd be happy.' And at first, Nicole was indeed thrilled with the results of her implant surgery. 'I was amazed by the results,' she confesses. 'They [the new breasts] were . perfect - exactly what I was looking for. They looked great and I thought . that was the start of a new me.' But her happiness was to prove short lived and just three weeks after returning, the problems began in earnest. 'The right breast had really started to . grow in size and the left breast scar had opened up and had started to . look kind of yellowy,' reveals Nicole. Miserable: Nicole's breast surgery happened after she lost lots of weight and dropped three cup sizes . Damage: The scar beneath her left breast became badly infected leaving her with fat necrosis inside it . 'There was a lot of pain and some leakage started coming out. Over the course of the next couple of days, things just kept getting worse. The . right breast was huge and it felt so sore, it felt like it was going to . burst.' She was rushed to hospital where doctors discovered that a pocket of fluid had developed in her right breast, while a severe infection was burning through her left. Both implants, said medics, would have to be removed. For Nicole, who'd had to work two jobs to afford the original surgery, it was a severe blow. 'I couldn't stop crying,' she remembers. 'Everything I'd worked so hard to get was being taken away from me.' Worse, not only were her breasts left saggier than before, they were two different sizes with the right far bigger than the left. Upsetting: Nicole was left with different-sized breasts and a rampant infection following the bungled surgery . 'My breasts looked worse than what . they ever did before,' she adds. 'I'm at an age where I should be happy and settling down . but it's taken away the happy bit.' Since having the implants removed, Nicole has been to see a cosmetic surgeon in this country, where she was told that due to rotting fat left behind by the implants, a further set would be unwise. Instead, she was given surgery to even up her breasts and to remove any remaining pockets of infection. Although disappointed, Nicole is resigned and says she won't be having surgery again. 'I think it would be for my best interests to be safe and healthy,' she explains, 'rather than having another implant put in.'

A woman who feared she would never have children has defied genetic odds of one in 100 million by becoming pregnant with identical triplets. Annabelle Williams was heartbroken when she lost her baby daughter four months into the pregnancy last June, due to a rare birth defect which prevented her child's skull from developing properly. But the 23-year-old and her husband James are now expecting three identical boys - the rarest kind of triplets. Triple surprise: Annabelle Williams (with husband James) feared she might never have children. But to the couple's joy, they have been told they are expecting identical triplet boys . Big news: Scans revealed that Mrs Williams was expecting three identical boys, who all share one placenta. This phenomenon only happens once in every 60,000 pregnancies involving twins and is even rarer for triplets. Recalling her first pregnancy, Mrs Williams, from Whitchurch, Cardiff, said: 'I had my first scan and everything was absolutely fine, but we went back a few weeks later and the doctors told me there was a problem.' After doctors explained their baby had a neural tube defect affecting the back of her head, they made the difficult decision to have a termination. 'It was horrible,' said Mrs Williams. 'I had never even heard of the condition before, so it was a huge shock. The doctors told me it can be caused by a lack of folic acid and has a 1 per cent chance of occurring.' After the termination, she and her Mr Williams, 24, a tattooist, had a series of medical tests. 'At that stage, I was scared we might never be able to have children, but the tests came back fine and the doctors told me to give my body some time to recover,' she said. Joy: Two months after losing her daughter, Mrs Williams discovered she was pregnant again - with twins . Third time lucky: But later scans revealed a third baby . But just two months later, Mrs . Williams discovered she was pregnant again and a scan at nine weeks . revealed that she was expecting twins. And . there was more good news when the couple returned for a scan a month . later, and discovered they were actually expecting identical triplets. Mrs Williams said: 'it took a few days for the news to sink in and although I would not change it for the world, it was a bit of a shock.' Waiting: Mrs Williams - currently 23 weeks - will have a planned C-section several weeks earlier than her summer due date to avoid complications . The scan revealed that she was expecting three identical boys, who all share one placenta. This phenomenon only happens once in every 60,000 pregnancies involving twins and is even rarer for triplets. The odds of producing identical triplets without fertility drugs range from one in a million to one in 100 million according to various experts, with the rarity making it difficult to calculate the exact frequency of such births. Mrs Williams says she sufffered morning sickness for the first few months and also started craving Marmite. 'It was horrendous,' she said. 'I woke up at 6am and started feeling sick and it didn't stop until 1pm. I was sick all the time and I could not keep anything down, but as soon as I reached four months I was fine.' She will have a planned C-section at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff several weeks earlier than her summer due date to avoid complications. Mrs Williams, who is now 23 weeks pregnant, said: 'I am feeling quite nervous about it all. They will be tiny when they're born and they will have to stay in hospital for six to 10 weeks.' She is already taking supplements and will be put on steroids at 26 weeks to help the babies' lungs develop. The couple, who live in a two-bedroom flat, plan to move to a bigger house and have already started shopping for their new arrivals. 'I read an article about a mum who had triplets and she gets through up to 40 nappies a day, so we're stockpiling,' she added. 'I've had to order a pram from abroad because they don't make them big enough. You can only seem to buy them for twins and I can't push two separate prams. We need a bigger house, but I don't want to move too far away from my family.'

Patients in England will have to pay 20p more for their prescriptions starting next month, ministers have announced. From 1 April, charges will go up from £7.85 to £8.05, and they will rise again to £8.20 the following year. England remains the only country in the UK where patients still pay for prescriptions, which are free in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Patients in England will have to pay 20p more for their prescriptions starting next month, ministers have announced . The Government said the increase was necessary to meet the growing demands on the NHS - its spending on drugs has more than doubled since 2000 . But charities say the charges unfairly tax sick patients - particularly those with long-term conditions such as asthma, multiple sclerosis, diabetes and migraines who are on several drugs. And senior pharmacists say some patients are having to choose between paying for drugs to alleviate pain or buying food and keeping their homes warm. They are also routinely being asked by frail patients whether there are any drugs they could possibly to without as they are unable to afford all those their GP has prescribed. Announcing the increase yesterday, health minister Earl Howe said: ‘This government has made tough decisions to protect the NHS budget and increase it in real terms, but charges for some items remain an important source of revenue to support the delivery of high quality NHS services. ‘This is particularly important given the increasing demands on the NHS, with spending on medicines alone almost doubling since 2000.’ But Neal Patel, spokesperson from Royal Pharmaceutical Society said: ‘Prescription charges have risen for 34 of the past 35 years. ‘Many have to choose between paying for their medicine or household bills such as food and heating. They face medicines poverty because they have a lifelong illness they don’t want.’ England remains the only country in the UK where patients still pay for prescriptions . Last week research carried out by the Prescription Charges Coalition - which represents 30 health charities - found that a third of patients had stopped taking drugs because they were too expensive. The organisation - which surveyed 5,000 patients with long term conditions - also found that three quarters had to take time off work. David Barker,chief executive of Crohn’s and Colitis UK, one of the charities represented by the organisation said: ‘These findings tell a heartbreaking story of people facing medicine-poverty because of the spiralling cost of their essential drugs. ‘Many are risking their health, and their ability to work, by having to make the impossible decision between taking their much-needed medicines to enable them to remain in employment, or putting food on the table for their families. England is now the only country in the UK still making patients pay for prescriptions as there were abolished in Scotland in 2011 in Wales in 2007 and in Northern Ireland 2010. It means that English patients are effectively subsiding free drugs for those living elsewhere in the UK. But recent concerns over poor hospital care in Wales - in particular long waiting times - have been linked to the abolition of prescription charges. A number of hospitals have high death rates and patients are waiting far longer for tests to diagnose cancer as well as in A&E. Experts have said prescription charges are necessary to fund a high standard of NHS care.","England remains only country in UK where patients pay for prescriptions .

The 'Peking Man', an ancient human ancestor that lived between 750,000 and 200,000 years ago, was an expert at lighting fires. Discovered in Zhoukoudian, south west of modern Beijing in 1923, the so-called Peking Man’s fire making capabilities have, up until now, been merely a theory. Now, researchers have solid proof of the skill after analysing ash from the archaeological site known locally as ‘Dragon Bone Hill’.

Discoveries: A bust of the Peking Man at the Zhoukoudian World Heritage Site, Beijing . This is the latest piece of a puzzle that scientists have been putting together over the past decade to build up a remarkable account of what life was like for the early human. Recent age determinations have shown that Peking Man lived in the area around 770,000 year ago, when weather conditions in North China were relatively cold. In order to survive the harsh weather, Peking Man would have needed to be able to create and manage fire. This theory been widely accepted since 1931. To test this idea, Dr Gao Xing, from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP) in China, looked at four soil samples obtained from the site. His team demonstrated that all four samples contained siliceous aggregates as well as elemental carbon, and the potassium content of the insoluble residues. They claim this analysis provides ‘very strong’ evidence for the onsite use of fire by Peking Man.

In order to survive the harsh weather, Peking Man would have needed to be able to create and manage fire, and now there is solid proof to back this theory. The Peking Man was outfitted, wearing animal hides that had been softened using stone tools. Belonging to the species Homo erectus, the Peking Man was also able to make bizarrely drilled holed in objects for as yet unknown reasons. ‘At present, the key point of the debate over the intentional use of fire by Homo erectus pekinensis at Zhoukoudian is whether or not siliceous aggregate (an insoluble phase of burned ash) is present in ash remains recovered from the site’, said Dr Xing. The re-excavation, in the village of Zhoukoudian, near Beijing, has unearthed fascinating details proving our ancestors were more advanced than previously believed. The Peking Man was outfitted, wearing animal hides that had been softened using stone tools. Belonging to the species Homo erectus, the Peking Man was also able to make bizarrely drilled holed in objects for as yet unknown reasons. Using powerful microscopes, the scientists have also examined tools used by the Peking Man to gain more details about their use. Scientists from the Chinese Academy of Science said that a 3,000-year-old living room, or 'activity floor', had been discovered in the cave, containing what could be a fireplace. Scientists have re-excavated the cave in the village of Zhoukoudian, near Beijing, where fossils of early humans, dubbed the Peking Man, were initially found . Chen Shen, a curator at the Toronto Museum and a special member of the academy, said that it was also likely the species had attached stone points to sticks, creating spears. The discovery could be significant as it shows the Peking Man potentially joining two materials to form a tool. The Chinese cave system is one of the most important Palaeolithic sites ever discovered. Archaeologists unearthed thousands of stone tools and hundreds of fragmentary remains from about 40 early humans as they worked on the site between 1921 and 1966. The human remains discovered in the cave were later assigned to the species Homo erectus. The original fossils of the Peking Man vanished in 1941 as they were being transported to America at the peak of World War II. A number of techniques have attempted to accurately date the remains numerous times over the years but have failed to find a definitive answer. The Peking Man was discovered in Zhoukoudian, south west of modern Beijing in 1923 . The famous Peking Man skull went missing after in 1941 when it was being transported to the U.S. from China during WWII. Scientists have revisited the site to discover more details about our ancient ancestor . Swedish . scientist Johan Gunnar Andersson and American colleague Walter W. Granger first arrived in Zhoukoudian in 1921 where they were directed to . the site by quarrymen. Upon arrival at the cave Andersson announced: 'Here is primitive man, now all we have to do is find him.' The . confidence was well-founded as the scientists had just discovered what . would become one of the most important paleontological sites in the . world. Anderrson . found human molars at the site but it was Canadian scientist Davidson . Black who made some of the most significant discoveries, despite his . initial findings being treated with scepticism by scientists around the . world. Around 200 fossils were gathered until excavation came to an end in 1937 with the Japanese invasion. Fossils . were placed in the Cenozoic Research Laboratory of the Peking Union . Medical College for safe-keeping, before being packed up for the U.S. in . 1941. But the fossils were inexplicably lost as they were being transported through northern China. It is still unknown what happened to the fossils with some believing they sank on Japanese ship the Awa Maru in 1945.

As Asia struggle with an ever increasing pollution problem, one firm believes a project that sounds like the plot of a sci-fi film could being relief. Orproject, a London design agency, wants to build a park enclosed in a giant 'bubble' - and says school playgrounds could be enclosed in smaller versions of the clean air system. The park would contain a large botanical garden, and be completely sealed from the outside world, with perfectly clean air being pumped into it. As a response to the bad air quality which is affecting many cities in Asia, London firm Orproject wants to build an enclosed park within the city. The park houses a botanical garden, the air inside the park is filtered, and temperature and humidity are controlled throughout the year. 'The park houses a botanical garden, the air inside the park is clean, and temperature and humidity are controlled throughout the year,' the firm says. 'The buildings surrounding the park, which are connected to the controlled air system, can house apartments, offices and retail, but may also offer sports or medical facilities which make specific use of the healthy air.' To create the unusual structure, the firm wrote an algorithm which simulates the development of veins in leaves or butterfly wings. Electricity for the project can be generated by solar cells integrated into the canopy surface, and the heating and cooling of the air is done through a ground source heat exchange system. The buildings surrounding the park, which are connected to the controlled air system, can house apartments, offices and retail, but may also offer sports or medical facilities. Park life: the protective bubble would completely seal the area off from the outside atmosphere, keeping pollutants at bay. The firm says the key to the project is a botanical garden to give resident respite form the polluted air outside. 'Botanical Gardens have been built in many world cities. 'They are attractions for tourists and recreational facilities for the inhabitants of the city. 'Both children and adults can experience nature and learn about the plants of the park. Parks would also be able to have seperate zones to recreate conditions anywhere in the world. 'Inside the green houses, the temperature and humidity are controlled throughout the year, which allows the growth of plants from any climate. 'The plants and landscapes from all over the world can be placed inside the Bubbles project.' The large park would be enclosed on all sides to seal the bubble structure .

They are one of the first examples of drone art - and could be created by anyone with access to a flying craft. These stunning images were created by Florida design firm Fiction - by simply taping some lights to their quadcopter. Using a tripod and a camera set to capture a long exposure, the team simply then flew their drone around in front of nearby landmarks. The images were created by flying a drone fitted with lights around in front of a long exposure picture. Thre be dragons! Photoshop was also used to modify the light patterns, allowing the perfectly symetrical images to be built from the flight patterns . The team bought coloured lights from home Depot and strapped them to a  DJI Phantom quadcopter. They then set up a camera with a long exposure on a tripod. Once the shutter was released, the drone flew around, and its light trail was captured. The team then used Photoshop to 'mirror' the trail, creating these images. The images were all created in a single night. The images were inspired by a sci-fi hit. 'I've always loved the aesthetic of the movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind,' Chase Heaveanor of Fiction told MailOnline. 'I love how they used lights to imply the shapes of the UFO as opposed to spelling it out for the viewer. 'So I figured I would try to recreate a similar vibe with the DJI Phantom and see what would come of it. 'I attached some lights that I bought from Home Depot and shot some long exposure shots of the phantom flying around. 'I then brought them back into the computer and created some cool patterns in Photoshop.' The team say the images took just a few hours to complete. 'We set up a camera with a tripod and spent a night photographing landmarks around our office winter Garden,' said Dylon York of Fiction.

A soldier who escaped from an Army's maximum security prison in 1977 has been caught in Florida nearly four decades later. James Robert Jones had been serving a 23-year sentence for murdering a fellow soldier in 1974, when he escaped from the military prison known as the Castle, in Kansas. But facial recognition software led to his downfall when investigators matched his photo to the driver's license he had under his new name. Jones was arrested as he made his way to work in Pompano Beach yesterday morning, and is awaiting extradition to Kansas. When police arrested him, Jones told them: 'I knew it would catch up to me one day'. The 59-year-old had taken on an assumed name of Bruce Walter Keith and changed his birth date to create a new identity that he shielded from everyone, including his wife, named by NBC Miami as Mary. Jones had been on the Army's 15 Most Wanted list since 1977, when he escaped from prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. He was serving a 23-year sentence for premeditated murder and aggravated assault after killing a fellow soldier in New Jersey, when he was a private. Officials say he managed to get a fraudulent driver's license for Florida in 1981, using the name of his friend, Bruce Walter Keith, and the day and month of his mother's birthday coupled with the year he was born. A spokesman for Fort Leavenworth told Mail Online Jones, who was 23 when he escaped on March 21, 1977, was last been seen working in the prison dining hall. Scroll down for video . New life: Jones was living at this Deerfield address with his wife, who did not know his true identity . Arrest: Jones was stopped by police when he arrived for work at this building on Thursday. He was one year away from retirement . Jones . was one of 11 inmates who fled during seven escape attempts between . 1977 and 1978. He was the only one to evade capture for so long. The prison has . since moved to a new building, and the section known as the Castle, where Jones was held, was demolished. The . Army contacted U.S. Marshals about two months ago for help in catching . Jones, after receiving information that he was believed to be living in . Florida. Facial recognition software was used to match an old prison photo to his driver's license image. 'That database hits on a number of key points on your face and it gives a number of potential matches,' Barry Golden, of the Marshals Service, said. In Jones' case however, 'It came out with one potential positive match,' he said. A finger print taken at the police station confirmed Jones' true identity and he admitted it too, according to the Chicago Tribune. Escape: Jones was serving a 23-year murder sentence when he fled from Fort Leavenworth prison . Alias: Jones had created a new identity and life for himself and was living in this Florida home . Jones had been just one year from taking early retirement, he told officers. 'Capturing a cold case fugitive who has . been on the run for almost 37 years is a great arrest for law . enforcement, but it also is comforting to the families of the original . victim to know the person who escaped from custody is now behind bars . again,' William Snelson, of the Marshals Service Investigative Operations Division, said. If Jones had served his full original sentence he would have been released 17 years ago. At a brief court hearing on Friday, the judge ordered that he be held without bond, and noted that Jones had been flagged as having 'violent tendencies'. Jones has been charged with homicide, military desertion and escape.","James Robert Jones was serving a 23-year sentence when he fled .

'Britain is a democracy where we can say what we want. So let’s say it,' is its slogan. Blogger Raheem Kassam, of website .

Asifa in a video made for BBC Three . In . a statement, the BBC said: 'BBC’s Free Speech is determined to discuss . the issues that matter to its viewers. However, out of respect to the .

The sprawling rock stars, their glasses of wine, and the pink flamingo on the mantlepiece are long gone, but there's no mistaking this iconic Manchester sitting room. Two decades after it featured on the cover of Oasis' first album, Definitely Maybe, the room is still instantly recognisable to anyone who came of age in the Britpop era. Taken in guitarist Paul ‘Bonehead’ Arthurs’ house in 1994, the photograph helped the album, which includes the hits Supersonic and Live Forever, to sell more than 15 million copies worldwide. The sitting room that launched Britpop: Liam Gallagher lay on the floor while Noel strummed his guitar on sofa . How it looks today: The sitting room in Jenny and John-Paul Hershey's house is little changed since 1994 . Spot the difference: Despite a few cosmetic changes, the Hersheys' sitting room is still recognisable . And the picture, which shows a young Liam Gallagher lying on the wooden floor while his brother, Noel, plays guitar on the sofa, has since become an iconic image for music fans all over the world. Today the Victorian townhouse, where Oasis filmed the music video for their single Shaker Maker in 1993, is home to a family with two young children, but the fabric of the room is little changed. The wooden floorboards are still uncovered, and while the wooden mantlepiece has since been stripped of its paint, it is the same one the flamingo sat on in 1994, though the ornate fireplace was taken when Bonehead moved out. The picture rails, original cornicing and even the shelves by the window are still there, although the small boxy television (showing the Clint Eastwood classic, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly), has been replaced by a more modern, flatscreen version. The walls are no longer pale yellow, having been repainted a more Noughties neutral shade, and the beige blinds have been replaced by long brown curtains, but the layout of the room remains the same, with a sofa opposite the fireplace and a seat in the bay window. A framed picture of former Manchester City footballer, Rodney Marsh, which stood by the fireplace, is replaced by a flower pot today.  And there's no sign of the poster of composer Burt Bacharach, one of Noel's idols, which leant against the end of the sofa. Home: The house in Didsbury, Manchester, was home to Oasis guitarist Paul 'Bonehead' Arthurs and his sisters . The floorboards are still bare and the sofa's still opposite the fireplace, but there are toys in the living room now . The convex plastic mirror on the left-hand wall has gone, replaced by a smart rectangular mirror in a wooden frame, and the spot where Liam Gallagher lay on the floor is now covered by a blue rug. And the globe light by the fire has gone, as has the pink flamingo, replaced by children's birthday cards and a watercolour on the wall. Mother of two Jenny Hershey, 45, allowed the pictures to be taken of her home in the smart suburb of Didsbury to mark the 20th anniversary of the iconic album, which came out in August 1994. A remastered, reissue version of the album called Definitely Maybe: Chasing The Sun Edition is due out in May. But Mrs Hershey said she will not be buying a copy of the reissue of Definitely Maybe because neither she nor her husband, John-Paul, 48, are fans. Rear of the house: Oasis filmed the video for their single, Shaker Maker, in the garden in 1993 . Sightseers: Mrs Hershey says she's used to Oasis fans peering through the windows but doesn't mind them . She said: 'My husband John-Paul bought the house in 1999 from Bonehead’s sisters, then I moved in in 2003. 'When I first moved in neighbours said ""Ooh, you’re moving in to the party house,’ because they remembered the days when Bonehead used to have the band round for practice sessions and parties. 'Unfortunately my husband and I aren’t Oasis fans, so we don’t fully appreciate how special the living room is to others, but we do have had friends and family asking if they can come round to have a photograph taken.' The house is included in organised tours for Oasis fans, and the Hersheys are used to spotting sightseers peering into their sitting room. Quiet street: The house that used to be known as 'the party house' is now home to the Hershey family . Mrs Hershey, who works as an education consultant and has children aged four and five months, said: 'To us, it is just our family home but we often get groups of people standing at the gate trying to get a look at the living room. 'We think it’s cool really. They are always respectful and never come past the gate to have a look. 'When Bonehead moved out he took the stained glass windows and the fireplace with him - we wish he'd left them because they are so beautiful.' She added: 'Once we were in the airport on our way home from America, and I noticed a picture of the Definitely Maybe album cover. It’s bizarre being able to see our living room pictured all over the world.'","Victorian house's sitting room was cover for Oasis' Definitely Maybe album .

Streets with rude-sounding names like Crotch Crescent, Turkey Cock Lane, Bell End and The Knob could turn out to be a haven for property hunters looking to snap up a bargain, as many will not want to live on a suggestive-sounding street. The study for website NeedaProperty.com looked for evidence of what impact living in a street with a cheeky name could have on the value of your home. Properties on streets with innuendo-laden names were found to be around one fifth or £84,000 cheaper on average than other homes situated nearby. A semi-detached house in Slag Lane, Lowton, Lancashire goes for a song at £112,620 - 26 per cent cheaper than nearby roads . Minge Lane in Upton-upon-Severn, Worcestershire, was found to have the most embarrassment value . Researchers asked 2,000 people to vote for the street name that they would be most embarrassed to have as their address from a long list and the top 15 were used for the study. Minge Lane in Upton-upon-Severn, Worcestershire, was found to have the most embarrassment value, picking up almost one third (31 per cent) of the vote. Slag Lane in Lowton, Lancashire, followed closely behind, being selected by just over one quarter (26 per cent) of people. But two-fifths (40 per cent) of all those surveyed said that a street name which some people might find embarrassing would not put them off living there themselves.

Properties on streets with innuendo-laden names were found to be around one fifth or £84,000 cheaper on average than other homes situated nearby . Residents of Fanny Hands Lane in Ludford, Lincolnshire - another of the streets that made the list - said they were not oblivious of its amusing name but did not think it made the houses any cheaper. Retired Annie Gray, 60, who moved to Ludford from Croydon, south London, 12 years ago, said the road name was one of the reasons she and her husband decided to buy their bungalow. 'It was one of the factors because it’s so unusual and always get a giggle,' she said. 'If you’re ever ordering anything and tell people your address, as soon as you say ‘Fanny’, they know exactly where you mean.' She continued: 'I would think it’s actually the other way round in terms of house prices. 'Magna Mile is just a main road, it’s not a village, and if you think about it logically where would you prefer to live - on a little side street like this one or a main road with busy traffic? 'It certainly didn’t seem to make a difference when we were looking to buy here.' Streets with rude-sounding names like Fanny Hands Lane, Crotch Crescent, Turkey Cock Lane, Bell End and The Knob could turn out to be a haven for property hunters looking to snap up a bargain, research suggests . The road name has attracted media attention in the past, Mrs Gray said, and the metal sign had been pilfered on a couple of occasions. The lane acquired its name after Frances Hands, the niece of a local farmer, lived on the street, Mrs Gray said. Janette Hill, 72, who also lives in the street, said she had been told the lane had been named after a woman called Fanny used to sit at the top of the road knitting. Ms Hill moved from the south of the country to the Ludford road in 2007 and said the cheapness of the property attracted her and her partner, but added it did not seem any less expensive than others in the area. Asked if she was bothered by the potentially embarrassing street name, she said: 'We just didn’t take any notice. 'You get people stopping at the top and taking pictures of the road sign but it doesn’t bother me.' NeedaProperty.com commissioned a statistician to compare property prices in the 15 rude-sounding streets with homes situated on all other streets within a one quarter of a mile radius, using Land Registry sales figures. Property prices on 11 out of the 15 streets were found to be 'significantly cheaper' than local values typically. Across all the streets looked at, those with rude-sounding names were 22 per cent or £84,000 less expensive on average.

The annoyance of missing a delivery could soon be over thanks to a new 'smart car' scheme that would let delivery firms simply leave them in the trunk of your car. The system would allow deliveries to be made wherever you are, as couriers can track your car via GPS. They can then simply open the trunk, leave the parcel and re-lock it. Scroll down for video . your dinner's in the trunk! Volvo is testing a new system to give delivery crews access to a car's trunk to leave packages. Last year, 60% of people shopping online had problems with the delivery of their item. Failed first-time deliveries cost the industry an estimated €1billion in re-delivering costs, Volvo said. Despite the rise of online shopping, research has also revealed that over a half of people are not at home to receive online deliveries, leading to further hassle and time wasted through failed deliveries. Consequently, consumers feels significantly restricted, find their day to day significantly disrupted which results in unnecessary and avoidable constraints on the most precious of commodities, time. Volvo showed off the system at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, saying it will 'allow consumers to have their shopping delivered straight to their car, no matter where they are'. Over half of people (60%) experienced delivery problems through online shopping last year and failed first-time deliveries cost the industry an estimated €1billion in re-delivering costs, Volvo said. The new 'digital key' system allows car owners to choose their car as a delivery option when ordering goods online. Via a smartphone or a tablet, they are informed when a delivery company wants to drop off or pick up something from the car. Having accepted the delivery, they then authorise a 'digital key' and can track when the car is opened and then locked again. Once the pick-up or drop-off is completed, the digital key ceases to exist. The system is based on the functionality of the telematics app Volvo On Call, which, among other things, makes it possible to remotely heat or cool the car and see its position or fuel level via the mobile phone. The technology was trialled during a pilot programme of 100 people, 86% of which agreed that ‘roam delivery’ saved them time. 'By turning the car into a pickup and drop-off zone through using digital keys we solved a lot of problems since it’s now possible to deliver the goods to persons and not to places,' said says Klas Bendrik of Volvo. 'The test-customers also indicated that the service clearly saved time. 'We are now further investigating the technology of digital keys and new consumer benefits linked to it,' A Volvo staff member showing off the system at Mobile World congress in Barcelona this week . The firm said it hoped the connected car concept would lead to other ideas. 'It's all about finding solutions that are intuitive and easy to use and that create benefits in the everyday lives of our customers. 'The important thing is to make these complex and advanced systems easy to understand for everyone, even behind the wheel. 'Deliveries directly to the car are just one first example of that,'","GPS allows delivery to be made wherever the user is .

It is probably not what the driver had in mind when he forked out £230,000 for one of the most luxurious rides going. But today an unknown motorist discovered that his white Ferrari FF has been written off after a dramatic-looking crash in which, thankfully, nobody was hurt. The person behind the wheel lost control of the performance car and smashed it into a tree, damaging it beyond repair. Write-off: The £230,000 white Ferrari FF was seen wrecked at the side of the road . Wreckage: A passing motorist pictured the totalled vehicle, which the driver had lost control of . Repairs: Rescue crew tinkered with the damaged car before it became clear it was unsalvageable . Impact came after the care came off the road, shooting 20 yards up a grassy embankment before being stopped in its tracks by a tree. The crash made a mangled wreck of the 208mph, 651bhp vehicle, which was photographed by passing drivers on the southbound carriageway of the A56 in Lancashire. Wayne Freeman, of Haslingden, said: 'My friend called me up to say there had been a bad crash on the road involving a really nice Ferrari. 'I drove there myself to have a look and it was a complete write off. It's such a beautiful car and I'm sure the owner's absolutely devastated. Supercar: The Ferrari FF has a top speed of 208mph and features mounted TV screens for rear passengers . 'But the main thing is that he's OK. A car can be replaced at the end of the day although it's going to cost quite an amount to replace that.' Police confirmed that the 6.2-litre car, which boasts a leather interior and TV screens for rear passengers, was the only vehicle involved in the accident. A spokesperson for Lancashire Police said: 'There will be no further involvement from the police.' When the Ferrari FF was launched in 2011, motoring editor RAY MASSEY took one for a spin. Here's what he had to say... Ferrari has really put the boot in with this shooting brakestyle, four-wheel drive supercar. Designed by legendary Italian styling house Pininfarina, it aims for practicality with power. The new FF is a sexier, faster, replacement for the 612 Scaglietti Gran Turismo and combines style with massive on-road presence. It's Ferrari's first production four-wheel drive, sending power to the front wheels as well as the back if the rear wheels can't transmit all the power the driver is demanding. Ferrari says it'll take four people plus luggage with 450 litres of boot space - slightly less than a Ford Focus estate. Style: Motoring editor Ray Massey was taken by the car's 'massive on-road presence' It bears more than a passing resemblance to British classics of the Seventies - the Jensen Interceptor and Reliant Scimitar. Expect Aston Martin, and maybe Bentley, to follow suit. The FF boasts colossal performance with 0-62mph in 3.7 neckwrenching seconds and 0-to-124mph in 11 seconds using the computer-operated launch control. With a top speed of 208mph, it's totally relaxed cruising at motorway speeds, as the fabulous sound from the V12 engine is directed into the cabin. Despite an enormous 651bhp  from its 6.2 litre engine, it's easy to drive. Its seven-speed F1 dual clutch gearbox can even be left in automatic if you feel lazy. In terms of pure aesthetics, the styling is rather ungainly from some angles. But would I care? Nah.","The supercar, top speed 208mph, came off the A56 and hit a tree on Sunday .

Collared: James Cosby, 46, has been arrested on charges of tampering with evidence in the killings of his daughter and her girlfriend, both 24, last week . The father of one of two women whose bodies were found behind a Dumpster in Texas has been charged with evidence tampering in both killings, which may have been motivated by the victims’ sexual orientation. James Larry Cosby, 46, from Houston, remains jailed on $500,000 bond, said Galveston County Sheriff Henry Trochesset. Trochesset said the investigation is ongoing and charges against Cosby could be upgraded to capital murder. ‘It appears that the young ladies may have been murdered in his home,’ he said. The bodies of Britney Cosby and Crystal Jackson, both 24, who investigators say were in a romantic relationship, were discovered March 7 next to a trash bin behind a store in Galveston. Officials say Miss Cosby died from blows to the head and Jackson from a gunshot wound. Loranda McDonald, Cosby's mother, suggested that her father may have murdered the young woman because she was a lesbian. ‘He said it to me a few times that he did not like the idea of her being gay,’ said McDonald. The grieving mother also revealed that she wants Cosby to ‘suffer’ and feel the pain that she is feeling. ‘Right now I hate him, I'm very angry with him,’ she told ABC 13. Investigators believe the women, from Houston, were killed elsewhere and their bodies were dumped on the Bolivar Peninsula. Scroll down for video .

Following the clues: Galveston County Sheriff Henry Trochesset said his officers interviewed Cosby after a candlelight vigil in honor of the slain women, and became suspicious of him and the evidence they saw at his house . Community activist Quanell X described the grisly scene inside James Cosby’s blood-spattered home. ‘Blood was all on the walls, all on the speakers -- on the sofa,’ he told ABC 13. Mr X, the family’s spokesman, also claimed that he found writings condemning homosexuality as a sin on Cosby's Koran, MyFox Houston reported. Crystal . Jackson's father, Reverend Ivan Jackson, told the news channel that he too did not . agree with his daughter’s sexual orientation, but loved her as much as . his other children. Mr Cosby has been charged with two counts of evidence-tampering. He is being held at the Galveston County Jail on $500,000 bond.

The founder of fashion site ASOS has separated from his wife amid fears that one of Britain’s biggest ever divorce cases could rock the hugely successful company. Nick Robertson, one of the UK’s richest men and great-grandson of retailer Austin Reed, is living apart from his wife of ten years. He is said to have left the £8.3million six-bedroom home in Wimbledon, South-West London, that he shared with his wife Janine and their two daughters, aged five and six. Split: Nick Robertson, the founder of of ASOS, and his wife Janine (left) and some of the site's models (right) Millionaire: Mr Robertson, pictured with ASOS models, has seen his personal wealth skyrocket in the last year . Wealth: The firm's founder, pictured with models and former finance director Jon Kamaluddin, is said to have moved out of the family home he until now shared with his wife Janine in Wimbledon, London . If they divorced, Mrs Robertson, 41, could win a significant slice of her husband’s £500million fortune. The couple met on a blind date organised by one of ASOS’s early employees, a friend of Mrs Robertson. Their break-up could spell chaos for the company if shareholders fear that Mr Robertson may have to sell part of his stake in the brand. The 46-year-old has a 9.4 per cent share in ASOS, the leading online fashion store, which is worth £5.8billion in total. Its affordable style is worn  by everyone from Samantha  Cameron to Rihanna – and in 2012 it became the most visited fashion website in the world for 18 to 34-year-olds. Last April, Mr Robertson was named the 298th richest man in Britain in The Sunday Times Rich List, and he is set to soar up the rankings again. In the past year, ASOS’s share value has doubled and his stake is now worth £536million. Friends said the couple have been living separately since early this year. A source said: ‘It is widely known among the Wimbledon set that they have split. ‘I think she got bored of being the housewife. He is a bit of a workaholic and has been travelling a lot with the business. I think they just drifted apart.’ Friend Alex Sandberg, speaking for the couple, said: ‘They are not living together but they are not talking about divorce.’ Mr Robertson attended £29,600-a-year Canford School, in Wimborne, Dorset. He got two Ds and an F in his A-levels and spent a brief period as a ‘ski bum’ in Meribel, France, before joining advertising firm Young & Rubicam. In 1996, he and friend Quentin Griffiths set up Entertainment Marketing. Four years later, they launched ASOS with £2.4million, mostly borrowed from friends and family.

I work reasonable hours – I have a . six-month-old baby, and a 16-month-old, so I have family time.’ Asked . what he spent his money on, he joked about his wife’s passion for . shopping: ‘I like skiing, football and I’m probably ASOS’s fourth . biggest customer after my wife.

Viewers said they missed out on some of the plot because they couldn't hear the speech in drama Parade's End starring Benedict Cumberbatch . Mumbling actors have been told to speak clearly after viewers complained the dialogue in many TV shows was inaudible, BBC chief Tony Hall admitted yesterday. Several recent BBC dramas have been criticised for poor diction and muttered lines, while other programmes had to be re-edited to make background music quieter. Responding to the criticism in the Radio Times, Lord Hall, 62, said: ‘I don’t want to sound like a grumpy old man, but I think muttering is something we could have a look at. ‘Actors muttering can be testing... you find you have missed a line. ‘You are balancing people’s needs as they get older – which, as someone of my age, I completely appreciate – with the creative need of a director to put in music or sounds that help to make the drama or the programme more real and vital.’ His comments came after Radio Times reader Richard Andrews asked him: ‘Are all your sound engineers 25? 'Haven’t you got any 55-year-old ones who realise that it can be difficult to hear programmes because of background music?’ But Lord Hall said things had improved after director of TV Danny Cohen responded to complaints. He added: ‘Danny Cohen has been going . through this with executive producers to try to get this better, and I . think the complaints are much, much reduced.’ Last year, actor Eddie Redmayne was criticised for mumbling in the BBC1 drama Birdsong.

Details have emerged how a rowdy bar-room brawl with fists flying, broke out in one of the country's most exclusive fitness clubs - allegedly because of a girl. It's almost two years since the fight which began in the 'Tap Room' bar of the New York Athletic Club. The melee resulted in the arrest of three men, with two reported broken noses and ten police being called to cart off the angry fitness enthusiasts. New court papers reveal a blow-by-blow account of the fisticuffs.between a Manhattan salesman victim Andrew Haesler, 50, and two other members. In the dock: Peter Doran (left) and Colin Drowica (right) in court for assault. The pair are being sued over a brawl at the New York Athletic Club's posh Tap Room . Melee: Multiple people were injured and at least three were arrested when a massive brawl broke out at the New York Athletic Club in April 2012 . Exclusive: A Manhattan salesman whose eye socket was fractured in a boozy brawl at the staid New York Athletic Club two years ago has filed a blow-by-blow account of the fisticuffs . Mr Haesler insists that he was not initially involved when punches started flying. Witnesses claimed the scene was more like . the Lower East side of Manhattan at 3am than a Central Park society . that costs $8,500 to join. Haesler's eye socket was fractured in a boozy bust-up, but in his lawsuit he insists that he and a pal were just trying to break things up between Wall Streeters Peter Doran, 29, of Glen Head, Long Island, and Colin Drowica, 31, of Manhattan. Soon after the event, the Wall Street Jackass blog went into great detail over what happened in the posh club. The witness wrote: ‘It was the best fight I've ever seen. Young people, old people, girls, members, non-members, it was a nondiscriminatory ragematch’.'Not sure the reason but it seemed to be over a girl. Members only: The reputation of the elite New York Athletic Club has been blighted by a sexual harassment lawsuit and reports of a brawl among members in April . 'Anyway, probably two broken noses . right off the back, one dude knocked straight on his butt on the first . punch, glasses thrown, broken glass everywhere , and all the tables . turned over or shoved to the side, they were making their arena. 'The . commotion ended so everyone thought ,  until somebody knocked the guy's . girlfriend over and this kid laid one dude right out. 'Girl . got knocked over again ......Second stoppage occurred after a good five . minutes when Luis the bartender joined forces to come in and stop it. BIG MISTAKE , Luis fell like a bag of sand after a fairly aggressive . push and he started screaming 'Call nine eleven.' The court papers filed by Haesler, some of which have been published in the New York Post seem to corroborate such allegations. 'Defendant . Doran was involved in an initial attack on a bar patron, which Mr. Haesler and his friend attempted to defuse,' the papers say. When Haesler tried to pull the men apart, the brokers both took shots at him, cracking his eye socket. 'Defendant . Drowica punched me in the face, fracturing my right orbital bone,' Haesler says in an affidavit attached to papers filed at Manhattan . Supreme Court. 'I was removed from the area of the fight by friends,' he . adds. But that was just the . start.

'When he heard me approaching, [Doran] turned to face me and punched me in the temple,' he says. 'Afterward, . defendant Doran repeatedly threw punches up at Mr. Haesler before the . police arrived to stop the attackers,' the papers say. Doran and Drowica, a director at Knight Capital, have pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault. Doran has stated that he may have hit other bar patrons, but never hit Haesler. That's not something Haesler agrees with. 'The . only rationale to explain how he could do so in a sworn statement is . that he has no memory of the night due to his intoxication,' Haesler . says in court papers. In a . letter to members, club president S. Colin Neill said: 'I cannot state . forcefully enough how abhorrent this event it to me, personally, and how . contrary it is to the standards of decorum that we expect of our . members and their guests'.

Home Secretary Theresa May has warned that people travelling from Scotland to England will be forced to show their passports if the country becomes independent . Scots will be forced to show their passports when visiting relatives and friends in England if the  country becomes independent, Home Secretary Theresa May has warned. In a major intervention in the referendum debate, the Tory MP yesterday insisted that Westminster would erect border posts near Gretna, Carlisle and Berwick-upon-Tweed. First Minister Alex Salmond has said a separate Scottish Government would not ‘kick out’ migrants and would welcome more foreigners. UK ministers are convinced that, without border controls, a separate Scotland would become a ‘back door’ to England for migrants. Mrs May  told delegates at the Scottish Tory conference that criminals would seek to ‘exploit’ the Border. Passport checks would force drivers to pull over on key roads to the south such as the A1, A68 and M74, while train passengers would have to endure Eurostar-style checks. Mr Salmond has claimed that an independent Scotland could join the Common Travel Area alongside Ireland and the remainder of the UK, where there are no border posts. However, the Irish government’s immigration policies deliberately do not diverge greatly from Westminster’s. In contrast, Mr Salmond wants to lift restrictions on non-EU immigration by relaxing the rules on minimum salary levels for entry. Mrs May said: ‘If the people of Scotland vote to leave the UK, there would be profound changes for migration policy. An international border would be created where one does not currently exist. Passports please: Mrs May  told delegates at the Scottish Tory conference that criminals would seek to 'exploit' the Border . Warning: The Tory MP yesterday insisted that Westminster would erect border posts near Gretna, Carlisle and Berwick-upon-Tweed (pictured) ‘This would have implications for people travelling to visit family, go on holiday or do business – and for our economies more generally. ‘Buried deep in Alex Salmond’s White Paper is the admission that, just like the last Labour Government, a separate Scotland would pursue a looser immigration policy. T . Pledge: Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond has said a separate Scottish Government would not 'kick out' migrants and would welcome more foreigners . 'hat would undermine the work we have done since 2010, and the continuing UK could not allow Scotland to become a convenient landing point for migration into the United Kingdom. ‘So that would mean border controls. Passport checks to visit friends and relatives. A literal and figurative barrier between our nations.’ There are an estimated 23million vehicle crossings per year in both directions and seven million rail passenger journeys. The 800,000 Scots who live south of the Border, and the 400,000 English people who live in Scotland would  be particularly inconvenienced when trying to visit friends and relatives. In her wide-ranging speech, Mrs May also claimed the battle against crime could be harmed by Scottish independence. ‘Criminals do not respect borders but rather work to exploit them,’ she said. ‘Never before has crime been so international. Organised criminal networks, and the internet, mean that people on the other side of the world can orchestrate crimes without even setting foot in this country. ‘So we shouldn’t make life any easier for them by erecting another international border in the middle of our United Kingdom. ‘Borders bring with them bureaucracy, delays and legal impediments. For instance, police officers from the UK and a separate Scottish state would no longer have powers to arrest or detain criminals in each others’ jurisdictions.’","Tory MP insisted Westminster would erect border posts if Scots vote yes .

An ex-soldier, dubbed 'Britain's Forrest Gump', has completed an 8,000-mile trek around the coast, taking him 18 months and raising almost £200,000 for the Help for Heroes charity. Adventurer Christian Nock, 40, set off on August 8 2012, from his local pub in Blackpool - Tommy Docks, and ran across the length and breadth of Britain, battling against the elements. He completed his journey's final steps by sleeping rough every night, covering every strip of the UK's coast. Christian Nock (left, centre) was dubbed . 'Britain's Forrest Gump' because of his epic walk, which resembled the . portion of the classic film which saw the hero (right) trek across the . U.S. During his voyage he fought the wet British weather, going through 14 pairs of walking boots throughout the trip. He beat the flu twice, got blisters, sickness, non-stop rain, suffered several near death experiences and had to use his army skills to survive. As he finished the 8,000 mile trek, he claimed he cried as he saw Blackpool Tower appear over the horizon, which signalled the end of his voyage. Nock chose to sleep rough throughout his voyage, despite many offers of a warm bed for the night . Christian Nock ended and started his voyage in Blackpool, where he was greeted by many people who celebrated his accomplishments, including the town crier . Mr Nock said: 'I've cried more in the last week than in the last decade. Seeing . Blackpool Tower just signalled the end and it was extremely emotional. 'Everyone . who has supported me on the journey throughout - following me on . Facebook, giving me a hot drink or a sandwich, cheering me on - has . completely reinstalled my faith in humanity. 'As an ex-infantryman . myself, I know soldiers struggle returning to life as a civilian. Many . struggle to reintegrate into normal family life, often due to a lack of . counselling and support. 'My aim was not only to raise an obscene sum . of money for Help for Heroes but to enhance public awareness of our . homeless soldiers by sleeping as they would sleep. Christian Nock arrives in Blackpool at the end of his 11,000 mile walk around Great Britain to raise money for Help for Heroes . 'I suppose I am a modern-day Forrest Gump, but this is no Hollywood movie.' Mr Nock came up with the idea when his Blackpool B&B went bankrupt, leaving him struggling to find work. He applied for more than 120 jobs, but got nothing but rejections, and was eventually left homeless and penniless. He set off to raise £10,000 for Help for Heroes by walking anti-clockwise around the coast from north west England. When he finished he was greeted by the Blackpool Town Crier. After sleeping rough for the last 18 months, he hoped to raise awareness of how many ex-servicemen and women who also end up on the streets. He has accepted hot meals and showers, as well as offers to wash his kit, but he always rejected the offers of a bed for the night. Nock ended up raising almost double the amount he set out to make during his trek, making £20,000 for Help for Heroes . His plan to sleep rough was often made worse by constant rain, freezing conditions, coupled with landslides and swollen rivers which made it dangerous to sleep outside. While his original plan was to raise £10,000 for Help for Heroes, he almost doubled this with his total of nearly £20,000. Bryn Parry, CEO and Co-Founder of Help for Heroes said: ""What Christian has achieved is nothing short of astonishing. 'Since Help for Heroes launched six years ago, the Great British public has done many remarkable things, but Christian's walk is unique. 'We have never heard of anyone contemplating this challenge, let alone completing it. 'Choosing to walk such a long distance over a sustained period of time - whilst sleeping rough to raise attention of homelessness - has required huge personal sacrifices by Christian. 'As a result of these sacrifices, Christian has raised an incredible amount of money which will help us provide practical, direct support to Servicemen, women and veterans who have suffered life-changing injuries and illnesses.'","Man slept rough and made it round the entire coastline .

Malaysia's Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein says Australia is among more than 15 countries considered to be possible locations for MH370, which has been missing since March 8, The Age reports. Other countries in the search include Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, China, Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, and France. It could be anywhere: Malaysian authorities have called on Australia to broaden its search in the Indian Ocean . Chief of the Australian Defence Force, General David Hurley, has re-deployed two planes in the search for MH370 . 'Malaysian officials are requesting assistance from these countries,' Mr Hishammuddin said. 'Officials are also asking countries to provide further assistance in the search for the aircraft including satellite data and analysis, ground search capabilities, radar data and maritime and air assets.' The Boeing 777 was last picked up on satellite at 8.11am on March 8. Authorities are considering hijacking and piracy as possible reasons behind the plane's disappearance. Chief of the Australian Defence Force, General David Hurley, confirmed Australia had been asked to help broaden the search area off the country's north-west coast. 'One RAAF AP-3C Orion commenced searching the Indian Ocean to the north and west of the Cocos Islands,' he said last night. 'This aircraft is expected to recover to the Cocos Islands overnight and launch from that location on Monday to maximise mission time in the expanded search area.' Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott confirmed on Monday afternoon that Australia would lead the extensive Indian Ocean search, after speaking with Malaysian counterpart Najib Razak.'I agreed that we would do so,' Mr Abbott told Parliament.'I offered the Malaysian Prime Minister additional maritime surveillance resources which he gratefully accepted.'I wish to assure the House and the Australian people that Australia will do its duty in this matter.'

Now it extends far and wide, including an area of the Indian Ocean that stretches halfway to Africa.A source in Kuala Lumpur has revealed the plane's fuel reserves were nearly empty when it was last detected on satellite - seven hours and 31 minutes after it took off.'It must have been almost flying on fumes,' the source was quoted as saying in The Age.

Ayotte said the Ayatollahs in Iran will watch whether US implement 'real sanctions' Ayotte is part of a young group of Republican hard-chargers who are pushing harder than usual this year for a GOP landslide in November, hoping to flip at least six Democratic seats and seize the majority. 'It's no fun being in the minority party, living under Harry Reid's rules,' she jabbed at the Democrats' majority leader. Reid, she said, has morphed the U.S. Senate from 'the world's greatest deliberative body' to a 'my way or the highway' institution. 'It matters so much for our country that we win this November,' she told a packed hotel ballroom in Nashua, N.H. 'Right now we're in a position where our allies feel abandoned ... and our enemies feel emboldened.' The Obama administration has shied away from referring to any nation as America's 'enemy,' including Iran and Russia. But Ayotte, along with other Senate Republicans including Kentuckian Rand Paul and Texan Ted Cruz, haven't been as reticent. A successful U.S. foreign policy, Ayotte said Friday, would mean America's 'enemies understand that you don't mess with the United States of America.' 'Unfortunately I don't think that's the message they're getting right now, and it's making us less safe,' she said. She joined former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore in saying that Mitt Romney, the Republicans' unsuccessful 2012 presidential candidate, had a most clear-headed outlook on Russia than President Obama. Democrats mocked Romney during the campaign when he referred to Russia as America's top geopolitical foe. 'Let's face it ladies and gentlemen: Mitt was right,' said Ayotte, who was once on Romney's short list to be his vice presidential running mate. Laughable: Sen. Ayotte took particular aim at Hillary Clinton and the 'reset' button she infamously gave Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in 2009 . The gimmick was supposed to symbolize the intention to 'reset' relations between the U.S. and Russia . Oops: Instead of reading 'perezagruzka' - the Russian word for 'reset' - a stick-on label used the word 'peregruzka' was used, which actually meant 'overcharged' She reserved special scorn for Hillary Clinton, the former first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of state who figured to be the Democratic Party's chosen successor to Obama. 'To this day, no one has been held accountable' for the 2012 terror attack in Benghazi, Libya, Ayotte said. And riffing on Clinton's one-time claim that it made little difference whether the attack was a premeditated terror strike or a protest that spun out of control, she declared: 'I want to say to Hillary Clinton that this does matter.' Ayotte also jabbed Clinton for her 2009 appearance with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Geneva, where she famously presented her counterpart with a 'reset button.' 'We want to reset our relationship, and so we will do it together,' she said then. The prop, meant to signify a new era in U.S.-Russia relations, now seems wishful to some in Washington, including Ayotte. And the message itself was misspelled. Instead of reading 'perezagruzka,' the Russian word for 'reset,' a stick-on label used the word 'peregruzka,' which means 'overcharged.' 'Lest anyone forget, it was Clinton who pushed reset button with Russia,' Ayotte said Friday.

An Alaskan moose hunter, who discovered . the body of a wanderer immortalized in the book and film Into the . Wild, has been shot and killed by police following a chase through the . city of Wasilla, Alaska State Troopers said. Police said Gordon E. Samel, 52, who played a small but important role in author Jon Krakauer's book about wanderer Chris McCandless, which was made into a movie by Sean Penn, on Sunday fled police who had approached his vehicle in response to a report about possible drunken driving. 'As the state trooper knocked on the side of the pickup to contact the occupants, it drove off and circled around several small businesses in the area,' an Alaska State Trooper report said. It said Samel then led law-enforcement . officers on a high-speed chase along the city's main thoroughfare, . briefly against traffic, and at times into lightly populated residential . areas before he was ultimately blocked at an intersection.When . a state trooper and a Wasilla police officer approached the truck on . foot, Samel backed up the truck toward the officer, prompting both the . officer and trooper to fire their handguns, the report said. Samel was . declared dead at the scene. Samel's . mother Roberta Lincoln told the Anchorage Daily News that she couldn't . understand why the officers didn't use a Tazer or shoot out the car's . tires instead of shooting him dead. 'I'm sure he was probably trying to get away but not run over somebody,' she said. 'He would never do that.' Scroll down for video . Immortalized: The story of Christopher McCandless (right) whose body was discovered by Gordon Samel, was made into a film starring Emile Hirsch . A passenger received a non-life threatening injury to one of his arms, and was released without being charged. Samel . was among a party of moose hunters who discovered McCandless's corpse . in an abandoned bus in a remote part of the Alaska wilderness north of . Mount McKinley two decades ago. Krakauer, . in writing about McCandless's death, looked to Samel for insights into . the young man's behavior, including his agonizing over killing what he . thought was a moose. It was not a moose but a caribou, Krakauer learned from Samel, according to his book Into the Wild. 'There's . a big difference between a moose and a caribou,' Samel was quoted as . saying in the book. 'A real big difference. You'd have to be pretty . stupid not to be able to tell them apart.' Grim discovery: Samel found Chris McCandless's body in this abandoned bus in the Alaskan wilderness . Samel's family told the Anchorage Daily News that he was a gifted mechanic and auto body repairman, and a 'big-hearted outdoorsman who struggled with bipolar disorder.' He had two adult children, a son and a daughter, and, when he was taking his bipolar medication, said his brother Steve Samel, 'he was a real asset to the family.' Samel's criminal history dates back to 1983, and at the time of his death he was under court-ordered restrictions from a September DUI arrest. According to the Anchorage Daily News, a report forwarded from the Alaska Bureau of Investigation to the state's Office of Special Prosecutions will be used to determine whether the use of deadly force on Samel was justified.","Gordon Samel, 52, was shot dead by police in Wasilla, Alaska, following a car chase .

'If we don't like Obamacare, we can get rid of it. Period. ... The party that put everything on the line for the takeover of our very good health care system has a lot to answer for.' A 2013 move to his family's vacation home in Rye, N.H. has made it possible for him to reclaim his old job while representing a different state – much like how former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton moved to New York in 2000 in order to take advantage of a looming Senate election there.

'There's only one way – one way – to get rid of Obamacare once and for all,' said Brown, speaking against the backdrop of a 25-foot-wide U.S. flag hung for the occasion. 'And that's to get rid of the Obama Democrats who rammed it through Congress and forced it down the throats of the American people.' Brown blamed Senate Democrats for most of Washington's chronic dysfunction, saying Majority Leader Harry Reid and his allies have stifled their opponents' efforts to moderate some of the president's policies. 'It's been ""My way or the highway,"" and I'm tired of it,' Brown boomed. 'It's time for the whole crowd to go.' The former senator, who swept into Washington in 2010 as a surprise replacement for the recently deceased Democratic lion Ted Kennedy, is now poised to give first-term Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen a tough re-election fight. But the 'carpetbagger' label will dog him the same way it did Mrs. Clinton 14 years ago. The New Hampshire Democratic Party was waiting for Brown in the tall grass, and quickly released a YouTube video Friday after his announcement, chronicling his past statements about his pride in being from Massachusetts. 'I'll probably die here,' he says in one clip. But on Friday Brown took every opportunity to paint himself as a New Hampshire-born child from the wrong side of the tracks, sounding like a candidate from the beginning of his 18-minute speech. He lived in 17 different homes by the time he was 18 years old, Brown said, in a soft voice that countered the impression left by his towering height. His parents were each 'married and divorced 4 times,' he said, working from notes but scanning the crowd – not a TelePrompTer. Brown himself has been married to one woman for nearly 30 years. Brown lost his only bid to defend his Senate seat in 2012, when liberal's liberal Elizabeth Warren swept him aside as part of Obama's re-election year . Dark horse: Brown wants to join a handful of politicians who have represented two or more states in the U.S. Senate, but first he will have to beat the popular Democrat Jeanne Shaheen . The Fox News Channel canceled Brown's on-air contributor contract earlier in the afternoon, as is their custom, when he informed the management there that he would be running for office. He wouldn't be the first person to serve in the U.S. Senate from more than one state. But Sen. James Shields' record of three states – Illinois, Minnesota, and Missouri – appears safe unless the Republican pays his realtor overtime. MailOnline confirmed Thursday that Brown would make the move. Matt Mowers, executive director of the New Hampshire State Republican Committee, shrugged around midnight and said that 'it's a rumor right now.' But two other sources had confirmed that Brown would use his Nashua speaking engagement as a launching pad. It's there that he announced on Friday afternoon that he's formed an exploratory committee, a necessary step before he can legally hire staffers to massage the media, poll New Hampshire's voters and craft a strategy for unseating Shaheen in November. No one knows how Brown, the former Massachusetts senator, will do in New Hampshire, but he's the GOP's most recognizable candidate and one of its most congenial and photogenic  speakers . The New Hampshire Union Leader had reported that Brown's political action committee had sent a total of $29,000 to a group of GOP committees. Those checks included $5,000 contributions to the New Hampshire state party, and the Senate and House Republican PACs. While passing the hat is a time-tested proposition for political players, Brown aims to double down on his unconventional 2010 victory over Democratic Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley, whom he trailed for most of the special-election campaign season. In New Hampshire, too, Brown is already behind the eight-ball. A Suffolk University poll released March 6 showed Sen. Shaheen with a 13-point edge, 52 to 39, among likely voters. But those percentages are soft since Brown's candidacy was hypothetical, and because they followed on the heels of $360,000 in negative ads run against him in January and February by Democrats and liberal special interests who were spooked by the idea. Brown's near-universal name recognition will perk up his numbers now that he has officially entered the race, Republicans hope, and they expect outside conservatives like Americans for Prosperity to continue advertising heavily against Shaheen for her cozy relationship with the increasingly unpopular President Barack Obama. For now, he's banking on a groundswell of support from breathless Republicans buoyed by the possibility of a return to the majority in the U.S. Senate. The GOP needs to capture six Democrat-held seats this year to wrest control from Majority Leader Harry Reid. If he wins in New Hampshire – provided he survives a cakewalk primary – Brown could flip the final seat Republicans want. In 2010 he was hailed on the right as a latter-day savior because Senate Democrats had passed the Affordable Care Act, but would need to hold a re-vote after the House of Representatives made its own alterations. Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick had appointed Paul Kirk, a former Democratic National Committee chairman and a one-time Ted Kennedy aide, as an interim senator, and Kirk voted yes. Political melting pot: Just like Republican Gov. Chris Christie's performance in blue-state New Jersey depends on working with a Democrat-controlled legislature, Brown had to work with liberals including fellow senator John Kerry, the future secretary of state . With Brown replacing Kirk after his election, Republicans suddenly had enough votes to filibuster the Obamacare law when it came back from the House. Reid and then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi had an answer: The law was bundled with a host of other legislation and passed in the Senate a second time through a process known as reconciliation – which isn't subject to filibustering. This time Brown could push the GOP over the top in the upper chamber of Congress, effectively stymieing President Obama's agenda during his lame-duck years. But first he needs to win. Brown said Friday that his wife Gail had urged him to 'stop complaining' and 'run for the United States Senate in New Hampshire' Granite State Republicans have already pulled off one upset this year, in a statewide election for a seat on the New Hampshire Executive Council – a five-member panel that serves as a mixed-party privy council to the governor, approving appointees and green-lighting spending proposals once the legislature has appropriated money. On Tuesday Republican Joe Kenney defeated Democrat Mike Cryans in a special election for one of those five executive council seats, winning by 1,267 votes in a race he was expected to lose. Brown, a state party official told MailOnline, wants to harness the sudden boost of energy to send him back to the Senate, this time for a full term. 'I mean, look what we just did,' the official said. 'Now I'm not saying Scott Brown will pull off the same upset, but god, I hope he does. Everyone in New Hampshire knows who he is already, and Jeanne Shaheen voted for Obamacare.' 'We really should be able to win this one.' At an event where long-shot presidential hopefuls are consuming most of the oxygen – MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum will make appearances – Brown's plunge back into a campaign with national implications has turned the event from a second-tier dog and pony show into a key feature of the GOP's plan to re-take the Senate. Before Brown's plans were leaked on Thursday, Scarborough was the talk of Nashua. The former congressman has toyed with running for president, but this weekend will mark the first time he is included in a straw poll alongside serious contenders like Santorum, Rand Paul, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, all senators who will share the ballot with Republican Governors Chris Christie, Rick Perry, Scott Walker, John Kasich, Susana Martinez and Jindal. But the biggest crowd so far has been for the man who as a part-time model once appeared naked in Cosmopolitan magazine, his modesty preserved only by creative cropping at the bottom of a centerfold. 'He's a handsome guy,' offered a Nashua hotel guest who identified herself only as 'Ruth from Manchester.' 'I'd vote for him,' she chuckled. 'Just don't tell my husband.'","The Maine-born Republican won a Massachusetts shocker in 2010 to replace the late Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy .

Sharon, Thomas and Sandra Schulte had a connectedness that was mighty for even the strongest of family ties - and one that even linked them in death. A family of five children, Sandra, 57, who went by the name Sandy, was the eldest. Born with Down Syndrome, she functioned at the capacity of a four-year-old. Sandy spent her life living with her parents in the country southeast of St. Cloud, Minnesota, sharing an especially tight bond with her mother Sharon, a writer. 'They were connected at the soul in a way that was quite incredible,' sister Kim Butkowski, told The Mail Online on Sunday.

'With all three, you really couldn't tell where one ended and the other one started.' Over the last few years, Sandy, who had participated and won medals in the Special Olympics, began to decline. 'Her health was failing and she was very weak,' Kim said. 'Walking was hard and she couldn't feed herself. She seemed to age quickly.' Then 18 months ago, Sharon was diagnosed with lung cancer. Her illness got progressively worse and mastacised to brain cancer. In November of last year, father Thomas began falling over and was experiencing memory loss. After a visit to the doctors, he too was diagnosed with lung cancer. All-but incapacitated, the three moved to the Talahi Care Center, a long-term nursing facility.

The Obama administration has enlisted the help of the mothers of celebrities to encourage young Americans to sign up for health insurance. The mothers of Adam Levine, Jonah Hill, Alicia Keys and Jennifer Lopez were all featured in a new ad released on Friday by the White House. The ad comes as the March 31 deadline for enrolling in health insurance rapidly approaches, and young Americans have been some of the slowest to act. Enlisting the moms: The Obama administration is trying to encourage young voters to sign up for heath care before March 31 so they avoid a tax penalty . Different look: Mrs Augello is seen with her daughter Alicia, who is an active Obama supporter, at an awards ceremony in 2008 . In order for the Affordable Care Act to function as it was designed, the administration banked on having a significant number of younger- and generally healthier- Americans enrol to help offset the costs of their elders. The latest report by the Department of Health and Human Services revealed that only 25 per cent of Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 have signed up, and the Economist estimates that 40 per cent would need to in order to allow the system to work. 'Young people feel invincible and until something actually happens, they will continue to feel invincible and unfortunately things do happen,' said Patsy Noah, Adam Levine's mother. This is the second video push aimed at young voters this week, as President Obama sat down for a mock interview with Zach Galifianakis on Between Two Ferns. Jonah Hill's mother Sharon Feldstein and Adam Levine's mother Patsy Noah laughed about how their 'rambunctious' sons and warned how people feel invincible when they're young . Fun with their sons: Mrs Feldstein accompanied Jonah to the Oscars earlier this month while Mrs Noah is seen with Adam at a Lakers game in 2009 . That video took the viral route, with the President and the the Hangover star trading barbs. Today's video went for the softer approach, with the moms reflecting on their celebrity children before they were famous. Mrs Noah called her son 'rambunctious, mischievous, naughty' and Jonah Hill's mother Sharon Feldstein painted the picture a bit more clearly by telling how he 'flooded the elementary school' and 'would lie on top of my dashboard and literally not get up'. 'Seriously, do you want your mothers to have a nervous breakdown? You need health insurance, it is imperative that you have health insurance,' said Mrs Feldstein, who recently accompanied her son to the Oscars. 'Taking care of yourself so your mothers can sleep after all they've done for you is not too much to ask in my opinion.' Alicia Keys' mom Terria Joseph said that because her daughter 'only had to hear a song once and she could play it so she never thought she had to practice'. Gymnast or singer: Jennifer Lopez's mother Guadalupe Rodriguez said that her daughter's physicality as a child made her think she would be an athlete later in life . Close to mom: Jennifer Lopez brought her mother to a Bafta event held in Los Angeles in 2011 . Guilt trip: Mrs Obama capped off the video by pointing viewers to healthcare.gov . Jennifer Lopez's mother Guadalupe Rodriguez said that her daughter was very active and started walking at 8 months and climbing out of her crib by her first birthday. 'At one point I thought ""Well maybe she should be a gymnast,""' Ms Rodriguez said. The video finished with Michelle Obama driving the point home. 'We nag you because we love you. Go to healthcare.gov and enroll today,' Sasha and Malia's mother said.","The mothers of Adam Levine, Jonah Hill, Alicia Keys and Jennifer Lopez were featured in a video released today by the White House .

The crisis in Ukraine 'would have been different' if Mitt Romney had been elected president, according to a former Republican Virginia governor. President Barack Obama, said Jim Gilmore, is sacrificing America's national security on the altar of rank partisanship, blaming Republican-led cuts in the rate of spending growth for new limits on America's involvement abroad. 'He's satisfying himself with ""Well, I have to scale back our safety because of you, because of your sequester,""' Gilmore told MailOnline, referring to a series of Defense Department budget cuts put in place as a dicey solution to a congressional budget stalemate in 2012. 'That's politics. That's not national leadership. He seems to be using partisanship as his excuse for a reduction of our national security and safety.' Jim Gilmore. Former governor of Virginia, briefly ran for president himself in 2007, but now dishes out criticism about the White House's current occupant . Would Putin have flinched? Gilmore says Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's more aggressive foreign policy would likely have made the Russian president sit on his hands instead of invading Ukraine . Gilmore was Virginia's governor from 1998 to 2002 and now runs the Free Congress Foundation, a conservative think tank that pushes for aggressive U.S. foreign policy. He told MailOnline on Friday at the Northeast Republican Leadership Conference in Nashua, New Hampshire that Obama 'doesn't have a vision for the big-picture safety and security of this country.' 'He should have reversed course' after Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, Gilmore insisted. If Obama had lost his re-election bid to former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, he said, Putin would have been less bold. 'In all probability it would have been different' with Romney in charge, Gilmore told MailOnline, since Obama isn't believable overseas. 'He doesn't seem to have the experience himself, because of his background â€“ his limited time in the Senate, his previous background in Chicago,' he said. 'That doesn't give him any foreign policy experience.' 'Moral authority and military power is necessary to preserve our security in the 21st century. Perhaps Gov. Romney would have done that better.' A spokesperson for the White House's National Security Council responded to Gilmore's comments by referring MailOnline to interviews Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken gave Sunday on NBC and CNN. Gilmore, no longer seeking any office, has become a GOP firebrand with a sharp tongue on foreign policy . Ukraine has sought urgent Western backing after Russian President Vladimir Putin is insisting that Crimea had the right to join his country even while shock troops have maintained a grip on the region's borders . Putin, fresh off the global luster of a successful Olympic Winter Games, has seized international attention by marching across Russia's western border, apparently not fearing a robust American response . Blinken said on CNN that Putin 'is not acting out of a position of strength. He's acting out of a position of weakness,' and claimed 'the international community [is] mobilized against the actions [Putin] has taken as a result of the president's leadership.' On NBC he added that the 'result of the mobilized support is that the financial markets in Russia have hit lows, the ruble has hit a low. Investors . are wondering whether to get involved in Russia because of the . instability. And all of that is exacting a real cost and a real . consequence.' Gilmore said the U.S. should continue to press Russia with economic sanctions, but do a better job of protecting Eastern European countries that want to change their courses. 'We need to recognize that Eastern Europe wants to be Western, and it's our duty to engage them as publicly as we can,' he explained, 'and make sure that everyone understands that we're drawing a line here. Obama says he's drawing lines, of course, but they don't seem to mean much.' 'What's driving him seems to be this idea that we have to pull back and pull back and pull back,' Gilmore said. 'Our friends in the United Kingdom, our friends in Europe and Japan, they don't want to see that. They still count on a robust America to lead the world.'","Jim Gilmore told MailOnline that the president is blaming Republican-led cuts in the growth of government spending for a lax foreign policy .

Neurosurgeon Henry Marsh is leaving the NHS after 30 years frustrated at the bureaucracy that he claims is ruining the health service . I have been an NHS brain surgeon for more than 30 years. Every operation I perform carries grave risks. The slightest slip can bring paralysis  or death. I also know that, in many cases, time is vital. But NHS bureaucracy has made working in the health service feel like swimming in treacle, bringing intense frustration for doctors and danger for patients. It is only now, as I prepare to leave the NHS, that I feel able to speak my mind. When I cycle to work in the morning, I never quite know what is going to happen – not only because I can never be certain how well the operations will go, but also because often I do not know whether I will get any operating done at all. One crucial problem is a chronic shortage of beds. The other is that the many reorganisations of the NHS have left a gaping hole in its centre – leadership. We all know effective organisations need leadership. In the past it was provided – for better or worse – by doctors. They have now been displaced, but not replaced. The many thousands of health professionals in the NHS who work so hard for their patients have no real leadership – and that is why the whole organisation seems to be permanently in disarray. NHS bureaucracy has made working in the health service feel like swimming in treacle, bringing intense frustration for doctors and danger for patients (File photo) My daily routine illustrates why doctors should be in charge of clinical decision-making in the NHS. I went in to work one Monday morning to operate. I was also on call for emergencies. I knew the hospital was full to bursting and could only hope there would be no emergency referrals. Three operations were planned – two patients with brain tumours and one with a spinal slipped disc. The brain tumour patients would need intensive care beds after surgery. But the last two had been filled with emergencies during the night. The lives of the tumour patients depended on their being operated on. If I could not do their operations today, . The ageing of the population and constant, expensive, technological progress means the NHS will always be in a state of crisis (File photo) I would have to cancel other patients’ operations later in the week, with endless knock-on effects. The spinal case, who was in severe pain, had already had his operation cancelled twice for lack of beds. He was very upset when I apologised on the second occasion two weeks ago. Outside the operating theatres, doctors and nurses looked glumly at a computer. ‘The network has crashed again,’ my registrar Tim told me. ‘I can’t even find the tumour patients,’ my anaesthetist Judith said. I’d seen them on the male ward but they’d been moved. Nobody knew where. One crucial problem is a chronic shortage of beds. The other is that the many reorganisations of the NHS have left a gaping hole in its centre  (File photo) Julia, our bed manager, told me we could do the tumour cases provided we could clear two spaces on the female ward, but that depended on whether we could move some patients back to local hospitals. I wouldn’t be allowed to start the list until we heard. In the past, I would jump up and down and shout when we had no beds and we would start anyway. A bed was always found because one had to be  found. In the past, I would jump up and down and shout when we had no beds and we would start anyway. A bed was always found because one had to be  found. Now, I would be reported  for bullying. So we wait until the managerial wheels have ground and a bed has been found. The end result is the same – emergency cases take priority over non-emergencies. In the past, doctors could make these decisions quickly and efficiently. Now, many hours of managerial negotiation are required. Two hours later, we started operating – it is unusual to start at the official time of 8.30am. The medical profession has been in retreat for many years, battered by one scandal after another and the rise of the new managerial class. Trust in doctors has been replaced by regulation (File photo) The first operation was difficult, but once we had finished, Judith sent for the second case. I was drinking a cup of coffee when Catherine, the registrar taking emergency calls, arrived. ‘There’s a 51-year-old woman with a subarachnoid haemorrhage and acute hydrocephalus. But there are no Intensive Therapy Unit beds unless you cancel the second tumour op.’ I shot off to the anaesthetic room, but the patient had already been anaesthetised. I either had to cancel his operation or find another ITU bed. The many thousands of health professionals in the NHS who work so hard for their patients have no real leadership and that is why the whole organisation seems to be permanently in disarray (Pictured is Resuscitation Unit Royal London Trauma Department) After a 20-minute discussion, we managed to find a bed, which involved moving four other patients around. Ten minutes later, as I was starting the second operation, Catherine put her head round the theatre doors.‘They now say there isn’t going to be a bed after all,’ she said. I groaned. The spinal case, needless to say, was cancelled for a third time. In the past, we used to have a waiting list. My waiting list for spinal surgery was almost a year long (although my offers to come in at weekends and operate free of charge were consistently turned down by management). The waiting list acted like a reservoir and allowed for the fact that emergencies can come in sudden runs that risk overwhelming the hospital. But cost-cutting in the NHS demands that we now have no spare capacity and waiting lists are politically unacceptable. But waiting lists allow surgeons to use their clinical judgment to get through operations in a sensible order. Patients, politicians and management must accept that emergencies should not have to compete for beds with the routine cases as currently happens. The central issue the NHS faces – demand for healthcare outstripping its supply – is by no means unique to this country. The ageing of the population and constant, expensive, technological progress means the NHS will always be in a state of crisis. The central issue the NHS faces, demand for healthcare outstripping its supply, is by no means unique to this country (File photo) Re-establishing clinical leadership by doctors will not resolve these problems but it would at least lessen their impact on patients. The trouble is that the medical profession has been in steady retreat for many years, battered by one scandal after another and the rise of the new managerial class. Trust in doctors has been replaced by regulation. Of course doctors need regulating, but so much of today’s regulation is absurd. In order to be revalidated by the General Medical Council as a brain surgeon, I have had to pass  a test that includes questions about the shape of stool specimens. My colleagues and I were recently threatened with disciplinary action for wearing wrist watches and not being ‘bare from the elbows’ when merely talking to patients. Next year, with considerable regret, I will leave the health service after 36 years. Like most doctors, I feel strongly that the principles of the NHS – free treatment for everybody irrespective of class, race or wealth – are essential to a civilised society. I intend to spend more time working in Ukraine and other countries where life is much more difficult. Countries which help you appreciate – despite its many faults and problems – the value of our National Health Service. Henry Marsh is a consultant neurosurgeon at St George’s Hospital, Tooting.

Paris is resorting to the emergency measure of making all public transport free in an attempt to deal with a smog problem that shrouded its famous skyline a murky veil. Nearly three-quarters of France is under alert in what the European Environment Agency says is the worst air pollution since 2007. Subways, buses and trains are free from today until the end of Sunday in the entire Paris region, as well as in the cities of Caen and Rouen. Bike-shares are also free, as are one-hour sessions for electric car shares. Pollution in Paris has become so severe that it has brought a thick layer of smog down on the city . Public transport has been made free for the entire weekend in an attempt to relieve the problem . While the pollution readings are not an all-time high for the city, meteorologists say unusually warm days followed by cool nights have worsened the situation. An environmental group brought a complaint earlier this week denouncing the 'inertia of the government' that it says has put lives in danger. Airparif, an organisation that was founded in 1979 to monitor the air quality of Paris, ranks the current levels of pollution as 'very high', the most severe ranking on its scale. After a spike in pollution readings in December, Parisian authorities took decisive action by lower the speed limits for some vehicles and banning large trucks from entering the city altogether. However, this has not been enough to reverse the problem. Smog is becoming an increasing issue around the globe but it has been plaguing Chinese cities for years. The problem has become so severe in Beijing that some scientists have likened its effects to that of a nuclear winter. Authorities are reporting the current situation as the city's worst pollution event since 2007 . A sign warning Parisians of the pollution levels and suggestions children stay indoors . After December's spike in pollution readings, Parisian authorities implemented traffic calming measures . Pollution in the Chinese capital can become so severe that planes are unable to fly and authorities are forced to shut down roads. This is on top of the real dangers it poses to the health of residents. The maximum safe level of PM 2.5 particles - pollution parties which are small enough to be absorbed into the bloodstream - is accepted as 25 micrograms per cublic metre but Beijing has been known to see its readings exceed 500. The Chinese government, which already uses planes to try and disperse pollution, has started testing unmanned drones as a tool to try and save its cities from smog. Other French cities, including Lille, pictured, are struggling with their own smog problems .

Instead, he tore the piece of paper on which the tip was written into strips and stuffed them into his mouth. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'A little dry': Richard Masten calmly tore up a piece of paper and ate it in a Miami court . Contemptuous: Masten was held in contempt of court for his stunt and will face two weeks jail . Protection: Masten said he had to protect the identity of the anonymous tipster . 'We promise the people who give us information to solve murders, serious violent crimes in this community, that they can call with an assurance that they will remain anonymous and that nothing about them or their information would ever be compromised,' he told NBC Miami. 'The case today started creeping into that... it's not going to happen on my watch and I understood the consequences.' Brennan ordered Masten to show her the tip after defense attorney Jean-Michel D'Escoubet asked to see the information it contained. D'Escoubet had no need to see the identity of the tipster, he said, only the information that was to be used against his client. Cocaine case: The case concerns a woman being prosecuted for cocaine possession . Unimpressed: Judge Victoria Brennan did not take kindly to Masten's actions and held him in contempt of court . Some believe Masten's attention-seeking stunt was an unnecessary step. 'In this case, there’s absolutely no information that I am looking for that has to do with the name or the identity of a tipster,' Jean-Michel D’Escoubet said. 'It's only the evidence that would be used in trial against her that the tip provided.' Brennan was going to make the decision as the whether or not the tip would compromise the identity of the tipster. However, Masten did not have faith in that process protecting the tipster. 'If you do it in this case, the question comes down the road, well you did it in that case why not this case,' he said. Crime stopped: Masten faces two weeks in a prison cell for his court paper feast . 'Well, I’m not going to do it in this case.' Brennan found Masten in contempt of court. 'The court would be remiss to turn a blind eye to a flagrant refusal to honor a court order, and give more value to an individual’s opinion on what is right, rather than to the dictates of the laws enacted by the people of Florida,' Brennan wrote. Masten will appear in court again next week and could be sentenced to two weeks in prison.","The executive director of Crime Stoppers in Miami-Dade faces two weeks prison for contempt of court .

The fortune of a tycoon ordered to pay his ex-wife £26million in one of Britain's bitterest divorce battles is still missing, the High Court heard today. Property developer Scot Young, 51, claimed he was penniless with huge debts during a six-year fight with his wife Michelle - but a judge last year declared he still had a multi-million pound fortune. Despite the ruling 49-year-old Mrs Young has still not received a penny, even though almost £8million has been spent trying to trace his wealth. Mrs Young was awarded a £20million settlement and £6million in legal costs in November after Mr Justice Moor declared her ex-husband was 'not a penniless man of straw with huge debts'. Mrs Young - who had demanded £300million - called the vast sum a disgrace and insisted her ex-husband was still worth billions. Today the judge accepted Mrs Young had still not received anything and said it appeared Mr Young had hidden his assets offshore. 'I do feel there is a real air of . unreality in this case,' he told Mrs Young's counsel James Bogle. 'On my finding on the evidence Mr Young has . hidden his assets offshore. 'Your client has spent £7 million and not been able to find . anything. Nobody has been able to find any money at all.' The claims came as Mrs Young made a failed bid to force her ex-husband's trustees Grant Thornton, who are dealing with his bankruptcy, to hold a public meeting and explain why they have been unable to recover any funds. She also wanted to have the firm replaced by a new firm of trustees, claiming she had been 'ignored'. Grant Thornton has spent £900,000 searching for Mr Young's assets over and above the £7million spent by his ex-wife, the court heard. The judge today ruled Mrs Young's claim should be decided by the bankruptcy courts, where Mr Young's case will resume later this year. Mrs Young, who lives in Westminster, central London, was ordered to pay the costs of today's failed application. Millionaire: Scot Young claimed he was penniless and bankrupt, but a judge said he had hidden his assets . The judge added: 'It is . not clear to me why anyone wants to be in charge of this case when . no-one has recovered any money at all.' At the settlement hearing in November Mr Justice Moor attacked the former couple for launching one of the most vicious divorce battles he had ever seen. ‘This case has been extraordinary even by the standards of the most bitter matrimonial breakdowns,' he said. 'Extremely serious allegations have been bandied around like confetti. ‘In many respects this is about as bad an example of how to litigate as I have encountered.’ ‘I feel nothing but sympathy for the two children of these parties. Through no fault of their own, their parents’ marriage broke down. ‘A marital breakdown is distressing enough for any child, but for the divorce to then be played out in the full glare of the media must have been absolutely appalling for them. ‘What has occurred has not been . child-focused. I truly hope that the parents will reflect on this. I . hope it does not happen to any other children.’ The judge rejected Mrs Young's claim . that her ex-husband spent £1million a year on dining out at expensive . restaurants with bills up to £5,000 a time. New partner: After splitting from Mrs Young, right, Scot Young is now involved with actress Noelle Reno, left . But he found the former 'Mr Fix-it' for Russian oligarchs and British billionaires had 'failed to give full and frank disclosure' about his assets and 'is hiding the truth.' The couple married at Chelsea Register Office in March 1995. He described himself as a property developer and his wife was described as a company director. The couple, whose daughters Scarlett and Sasha are aged 21 and 19, were living in Miami when they split up in 2006 after the relationship broke down. Mrs Young was granted a divorce in February last year because of what the court ruled was his unreasonable behaviour. However, she has said she will not agree to the divorce being made absolute - allowing her ex-husband to remarry - until the financial arrangements have been completed. In January last year the same judge sent Mr. Young to prison for six months for 'flagrant and deliberate' contempt of court for failing to provide financial information to Michelle. Mr Young has said that once divorced he plans to wed his 29-year-old fiancee, the model and actress Noelle Reno, with whom he lives in a luxury apartment in South Kensington, London. He made no comment when he left court.","Scot Young told to pay Michelle £20m settlement and £6m costs last year .

Target discarded a system of security alarms alerting them to their landmark data breach, which left over 40 million customers vulnerable to credit card theft and identity fraud, garnered the department store more than 90 lawsuits and is expected to cost them billions of dollars in ongoing damage control. New information obtained by Bloomberg Businessweek on Thursday has shown the United States' no. 3 retailer detected potentially malicious activity during last year's hack but that staff declined to take immediate action. The online attack started sometime before Thanksgiving 2013, when hackers were able to install malware - malicious software - onto Target's central security system, which was designed to steal every credit card transacted at the company's 1,797 U.S. stores. The stolen information was being stored on a special server, and at a certain point - likely to be after the holiday shopping spike - the hackers would export all of it out of the database and into their control. Was it preventable? The credit cards of over 40 million Target customers were said to have been compromised by last years data breach, which was designed to attack all 1,797 US stores. While security technology picked up the hack, it was not enough for US officials to put a stop to it . However Target was prepared for such a scam, according to Bloomberg, and had installed a $1.6 million malware detection system six months earlier. Made by computer security firm FireEye (FEYE), which also services the CIA and the Pentagon, the system was manned around-the-clock by a security team in Bangalore, India. If Banagalore noticed anything suspicious, they would immediately notify Target's security operations center in Minneapolis. On Saturday November 30, the hackers began moving the stolen credit card numbers to 'staging points' spread across the US - in order to cover their tracks - before redirecting the data to their own computers in Russia. Bangalore realized the breach and contacted Target headquarters, however the officials in Minneapolis overlooked the warnings. Some 40 million credit card numbers and 70 million addresses, phone numbers and other pieces of personal information were then successfully extracted from the Target mainframe. It is not known what happened inside Target for the sirens to be ignored, however computer experts say the company was likely to receive hundreds of such alerts on a daily basis. On Friday, company spokeswoman Molly Snyder acknowledged the company declined to act early enough. FireEye is a sophisticated computer security company used by both the CIA and the Pentagon. The FEYE system Target were using at the time picked up the malicious activity, however U.S. did not immediately act upon it . 'With the benefit of hindsight, we are investigating whether if different judgments had been made the outcome may have been different,' Snyder said in a statement. Two security experts who advise organizations in responding to cyber attacks and both have experience using FireEye technology said that security personnel typically don't get excited about such generic alerts because FireEye does not provide much information about those threats. 'They are bombarded with alerts. They get so many that they just don't respond to everything,' said Shane Shook, an executive with Cylance Inc. 'It is completely understandable how this happened.' John Strand, owner of Black Hills Information Security, said that it was easy to paint Target as being incompetent, given the severity of the breach, but that it was not fair to do so. 'Target is a huge organization. They probably get hundreds of these alerts a day,' he said. 'We can always look for someone to blame. Sometimes it just doesn't work that way.' Target Chief Financial Officer John Mulligan told a congressional committee in February that the company only began investigating after on December 12, when the U.S. Justice Department warned the company about suspicious activity involving payment cards. Within three days, nearly all the malicious software had been removed from Target's cash registers, he said. 'Through our investigation, we learned that after these criminals entered our network, a small amount of their activity was logged and surfaced to our team,' Snyder said. 'That activity was evaluated and acted upon. Some 40 million credit and debit card accounts were affected by the data breach that happened between Nov. 27 and Dec. 15 - just as the holiday shopping season was getting into gear . 'Based on their interpretation and evaluation of that activity, the team determined that it did not warrant immediate follow up.' Target shares fell 2 percent to $59.86 in late afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange after the company released the statement. Some 40 million payment card records were stolen from the retailer, along with 70 million other records with customer information such as addresses and telephone numbers. Congress is investigating the breach along with lapses at other retailers, and credit card companies were pushing for better security. Target also faces dozens of potential class-action lawsuits and action from banks that could seek reimbursement for millions of dollars in losses due to fraud and the cost of card replacements. A spokesman for FireEye declined to comment. FireEye shares were up 1.8 percent at $79.05 on Nasdaq. Representatives for the U.S. Secret Service and Verizon Communications Inc, which are investigating Target's breach, declined to comment. FireEye has a function that automatically deletes malicious software, but it had been turned off by Target's security team before the hackers' attack, the Bloomberg report said, citing two people who audited FireEye's role after the breach. Shook and Strand said that the vast majority of FireEye's customers turn off that functionality because it is known for incorrectly flagging data as malware, which can halt email and Web traffic for business users. 'FireEye ... is cutting edge,' Strand said. 'But it takes love and care and feeding. You have to watch it and monitor it.'","Target installed a $1.6 million security system six months before the attack in November .

Dwayne Stovall wants Texans to know that U.S. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell 'looks and fights like a turtle,' and he hopes that image will bleed over to Republican Sen. John Cornyn â€“ the man whose job he wants. 'We Texans don't need a Beltway turtle telling us how to fight,' Stovall says in his newest video ad. The slight is related to what Stovall sees as a lack of action from Cornyn, the state's senior senator and the Senate Minority Whip, to block elements of the Affordable Care Act. Ted Cruz, the junior senator, won national attention in September for monopolizing the Senate floor for 21 hours in a quasi-filibuster aimed at forcing changes to the Obamacare law as a condition of avoiding a government shutdown. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Mitch McConnell 'looks and fights like a turtle,' Stovall says in his ad, hammering his opponent Sen. John Cornyn for working with the Minority Leader from Kentucky . 'We Texans don't need a Beltway turtle telling us how to fight,' the tea party-backed candidate says, deadpanning for the camera . 'This past summer,' Stovall said in his first radio ad, 'one of our senators fought hard for us to keep Washington from ruining our health care system, and one of them didn't fight for us at all.' 'I'm worried, and I'm mad about that,' the tea party darling continued. Stovall will compete against Cornyn and a handful of other Senate hopefuls, including Congressman Steve Stockman, in a March 4 Republican primary. If Cornyn should capture 50 per cent of the vote, he'll be the GOP nominee to keep his seat. Otherwise, the top two Republicans will have to meet in a runoff on May 27. Brett Rogers, his spokesman, told MailOnline that Stovall's stock is high since he 'has won ten out of ten straw polls' in Texas. 'I like Turtle soup,' says Stovall's golden retriever, Major, in a voiceover -- and you can't even see the pooch's lips move . Cornyn (R) met King Abdullah II or Jordan on Feb. 12, accompanied by Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid (L) and the allegedly testudinal McConnell (2nd R) Stovall's comparison of Sen. McConnell to a shell-covered slowpoke isn't new: The Daily Caller popularized the idea in 2011. Tea party chaos: Texas Rep. Steve Stockman, another conservative GOP Senate hopeful, met with trouble in January after his campaign Photoshopped an image of President Obama to make it look like Sen. Cornyn was in the picture with him . Rogers playfully told MailOnline that Stovall's golden retriever, Major, made the turtle identification on his own. He 'pointed to the TV when Mitch was on, just like when Dwayne takes him hunting,' said Rogers. 'The resemblance was obvious.' In the Stovall ad, a comic voiceover has Major saying, 'I like turtle soup!' The risk of offending the Senate's top Republican is a serious one: If Stovall were to upset Cornyn in March or May, and then go on to win the general election against a Democratic candidate, he would enter the Senate with a party leader who might retaliate by relegating him to less-than-impressive committees. But Rogers insisted it's no big deal. 'I think it's more important that Mitch McConnell and Harry Reid pray that Dwayne Stovall doesn't get to the Senate,' he said, 'because no matter what assignments he's given he will fight like you've never seen against bigger government and more debt.' 'And besides, Matt Bevin is going to wipe the floor with Mitch McConnell,' he added, referring to McConnell's own primary fight in Kentucky. Cornyn's and McConnell's offices did not respond to a request for comment.","The latest wacky U.S. campaign ad comes from a Dwayne Stovall, a Texas tea partier who claims Sen.

A 22-year-old woman who was told by doctors she would never get pregnant naturally has revealed her joy at being Britain's youngest mother of identical quadruplets. Charlene Medlicott defied 25 million-to-one odds when she gave birth to four girls two years ago. She had previously been warned she would probably never have a family without IVF treatment. Charlene Medlicott, 22, has become Britain's youngest mother of identical quadruplets after it was discovered that Eveylynn, Gracie-Lou, Rosaline and Amalia-Rose are identical. She is pictured with her partner, Mark . So Ms Medlicott was stunned when she conceived naturally and was told she was carrying four babies. On December 11, 2011 she gave birth to 3lbs 6oz Gracie-Lou, 3lbs 4oz Rosaline, 2lbs 9oz Amalia-Rose and 2lbs 6oz Eveylynn. Doctors initially believed she had two sets of identical twins but after the girls’ father, Mark, struggled to tell his daughters apart DNA evidence revealed all four girls are identical. It means Ms Medlicott, a trainee neo-natal nurse, is Britain's youngest mother of identical quadruplets which could see her enter the record books. The mother, from Telford, Shropshire, said: ‘I always knew my girls were special but now they could be record breakers too. ‘I really can't believe the girls are identical. It was initially thought Ms Medlicott was carrying two sets of identical twins because scans revealed there were two sacs inside her womb . ‘We paid to have the DNA tests done because I was noticing they all looked so alike and Mark was struggling to tell them apart. ‘We got the results last week which showed the girls are all identical. ‘After looking on the internet the only other youngest mum of identical quadruplets was 27. I was 19 when I carried them and 20 when I had them. I'm sure I must be the youngest.’ It is most common for quadruplets to occur when four separate eggs are fertilised by four separate sperm. If this happens, none of the babies are identical. However, quads can also occur when one fertilised egg splits into four - this causes four identical babies. Quads can also be made up of identical triplets and another baby, two sets of identical twins or one set of identical twins and two non-identical babies. Quads are most common in women undergoing fertility treatment. Women with a family history of multiple births, Nigerian women and older mothers are also all at increased risk of multiple births. The chances of having quads in the UK is one in 142,000. For mothers not undergoing fertility treatment, the chance of having quads is one in 729,000. Ms Medlicott was diagnosed with polycystic ovaries when she was 15. The condition restricts ovulation dramatically reducing a woman's chances of becoming pregnant. But five years later she stunned doctors when she conceived naturally and was dumbfounded when she discovered she was expecting four girls. Worried doctors advised her to abort two of her babies over concerns all four would struggle to survive in the womb. But she refused and today she has four identical healthy baby girls. She said: ‘I never expected to fall pregnant so it was a real surprise when I was told I was expecting. ‘When the doctors said I should abort two of the babies I was devastated. I said “No, just no. It's murder.” I don't believe in abortion. ‘I'm so happy I stuck to my guns because I have four healthy babies. ‘I had a scan at six weeks and it looked like there were two different sacs which meant I was going to have two sets of twins. ‘The labour was fine up until 24 weeks when I was admitted to hospital and then I was transferred up to Liverpool Women's Hospital where I stayed until they were born. ‘I nearly died because my weight dropped, I just couldn't eat enough for all of us. I was eating enough for the babies but not for me. ‘I don't really remember the labour which was when I was 30 weeks, I just remember seeing three heads. Ms Medlicott was told she would probably not be able to have children naturally because of polycystic ovaries . ‘We were kept in hospital and the girls were in a neo-natal unit but we were all home eight weeks later. ‘Luckily the girls have always been really good and have always had a good routine. ‘As they got older we realised how similar they all looked but we had always been told by the doctors they were two pairs of twins. ‘We didn't bother to question it at first but then we thought we would check because we knew how rare it was.’ At Christmas Ms Medlicott, who is . engaged to the girls' father, Mark Connaughton, 27, decided to pay for a . DNA test on her daughters. Mr Connaughton, who works at Tesco, said: ‘It was a big shock to the system. DNA test results have now revealed that the quadruplets are definitely all identical . ‘To find out you're having one is enough of a surprise, but four is very different. ‘It feels extremely special now we know they're identical but I'm going to have to find a way of telling them apart. ‘I can struggle to tell them apart and I'm always getting them confused. ‘They soon tell me though when I call them the wrong name, I am sure they will be using it to their advantage when they are older.’ The girls will now join 70 sets of all-identical quadruplets worldwide.","Charlene Medlicott was diagnosed with polycystic ovaries at 15 .

'But we both want a . two-state solution and he has got a contribution to help bring that . about by helping generate Palestinian economic growth.' When . questioned about his relationship with his predecessor, he said: 'I . obviously listen to Tony Blair's advice, as I listen to many people's . advice. 'I wouldn't say it is about friendship. 'We were very vigorous opponents. 'I remember facing him across the dispatch box every Wednesday at prime minister's questions.'

Because of the peace process in the . middle east, Blair, in his duties of economic planning, is constantly . facing issues to do with peace talks, as they are vital to boosting the . economy in the area. The . meeting with Blair lasted around 20 minutes, and during the talks the . pair discussed Mr Blair's Palestinian economic initiatives. Following the meeting, Blair said: 'The British Government has actually got a great opportunity here, . because it is relatively trusted by both sides, which is quite rare in . this situation. Prime Minister David Cameron (centre) meets with young Palestinians, to discuss economic and humanitarian issues . 'I think we have got the right idea on relationships between a political . negotiation to resolve all the difficult issues about borders and . security and Jerusalem and so on, and the economic side, which is . absolutely vital because if we don't build the Palestinian economy up at . the same time as you are pursuing the political negotiation then a . state for the Palestinians seems a dream and not a reality.' Cameron has promised £1.5 million in grants to help Palestinian companies with foreign investment. He . also wants to see more training for the 1,000 female refugees in Gaza, . to create new jobs and industries that would lead to benefits to Israel.

Nathan and Charlene secretly practised their dance routine in secret for eight months in their living room . Only Charlene was in on the surprise when Nathan wheeled himself out of the reception - and went to a cupboard where a pair of prosthetic legs had been hidden away from guests. Moments later there were gaps of astonishment then cheers and applause as Nathan and Charlene took to the floor . And there wasn’t a dry eye in the house as the pair didn’t put a foot wrong during their three-minute routine - described as good enough for Strictly Come Dancing. Now the javelin thrower will star in the real thing after his wedding video went viral and made headlines around the world. Nathan had owned a pair of prosthetic legs for years before dancing at his wedding but never wore them as they caused him agony. Nathan was nine when a tragic train accident meant he lost both his legs . He has prepared for the gruelling dance training by visiting a prosthetic engineer who padded his prosthetic legs with silicone and attached straps to stop them rubbing. He and the other four other Paralympians then spent a week practicing their Salsa routines in the studio for seven hours every day. Nathan, who is partnered with Strictly professional Iveta Lukosiute, said: 'My right leg took a bit of battering because it was holding my weight. 'On my crutches, all the weight is on my shoulders so I wasn’t used to it.

He said: 'Halfway through the week, I said I was going to throw my legs on a bonfire but I stuck with it and I’m so glad I did. 'It got quite emotional for all of us, and I think we all realised just how much more we can do if we push ourselves. 'I’m going to start doing more things on two legs now. 'I now know I can break down mental barriers and I have a new mentality and outlook on life.' Nathan is now preparing to dedicate his time to training for the Rio Paralympics in 2016.

A Texas Border Patrol officer killed himself after brutally raping an undocumented immigrant and her two daughters near the border fence, officials said. Esteban Manzanares, 32, of Mission, sexually assaulted and slashed a mother before assaulting and trying to break the neck of her 14-year-old daughter Wednesday. He then kidnapped her other 14-year-old daughter and held her hostage in his apartment before eventually raping her and taking his own life, officials said. He first raped the woman and slashed her wrists before raping her 14-year-old daughter and trying to break her neck, officials told The McAllen Monitor. He left both women for dead, but they are expected to survive their injuries. Scroll down for video . Horrifying accusations: Esteban Manzanares reportedly raped three women and tried to kill two of them before committing suicide . Manzanares then fled the remote crime scene with the woman’s other 14-year-old daughter, tied her up in his apartment and stuffed a sock in her mouth to keep from calling for help while he finished the rest of his shift, authorities said. He raped her just before midnight and then killed himself with a single gunshot wound as police circled his home, said police. ‘They said shots fired, shots fired,’ a neighbor of Manzanares told KGRV. ‘We didn't hear any shots. Then they asked us to remove our kids from the room that was attached to his apartment.’ ‘An hour later, after they were standing outside with guns, they asked us to leave,’ the woman continued. The grisly series of attacks targeting the Honduran immigrants took place near the border fence outside Abram, and may have been triggered by Manzanares’s recent divorce. He missed his children: Manzanares had posted recently about missing his children only days after his divorce was made final . Recently divorced: Manzanares' divorce was finalized Jan 29, and he recently posted about missing his children . The initial two attacks occurred in an isolated area with tall grass and many trees. The third rape happened at his apartment in the border town. All three women are expected to survive the traumatizing events. Federal officials provided only a prepared statement regarding the horrifying accusations. ‘Overnight, the Mission Police Department entered into the personal residence of a Border Patrol agent after further information was obtained. Upon entry, Mission PD Department, together with CBP and other law enforcement entities, found the agent deceased and discovered the third female.’ Family court records cited by the Monitor show the divorce became final on January 29, and that he and ex-wife Susana Manzanares shared joint custody of their one-year-old son and six-year-old daughter. Susana Manzanares said Esteban Manzanares petitioned her for the split and that she hadn’t noticed any difference in him during or after the proceedings. Terrifying encounter: Manzanares is said to have raped a mother and slashed her wrists before raping one of her teen daughters and trying to break her neck . FInal destination: He then took the other teen daughter to his apartment, tied her up and stuffed a sock in her mouth before raping her later that day and taking his own life - she survived . ‘He was still the same person,’ she told the paper. ‘I didn't notice anything. He wanted the divorce so I don't know why it would affect him. We both wanted it.’ The devoted father had recently posted several pictures to Facebook with his young children, one captioned ‘missing my kids so much.’ A former neighbor from the home Esteban Manzanares shared with his wife prior to the divorce was shocked when told of his actions. ‘He was quiet, I didn’t think, I mean, you would never think he’d do something like this,’ said Neira Galvin. ‘How are you supposed to tell the kids this? He was so quiet, I never thought anything of it.’ This is the second time this year a Border Patrol agent assigned to the Texas-Mexico border has been accused of a violent crime. Adam Garibay, 33, of Corpus Christi, was arrested January 3 after restraining and beating his wife until she gave up the name and address of a man she was having an affair with – he then shot the man dead before police brought him into custody after a high speed chase.","Esteban Manzanares is accused of raping a mother and her two 14-year-old daughters near the border fence in Texas .

Dominique was just 13 years old when she was first trafficked for sex - one of an estimated 100,000 American children sold into prostitution each year, according to anti-trafficking charity, Saving Innocence. And Dominique, now 18 and back in school, is by no means unusual. As Mark Harris, director of hard-hitting new film Abducted, reveals, teenage girls are easy prey for traffickers. 'Girls go out to LA thinking they're going to be pop stars and then they get drugged up and end up in trafficking,' he explains. Grim: A scene from Abducted, showing what happens to the girls taken by traffickers in LA . 'Only two per cent [of young girls who go there] find work. Agents don't give a s*** about talent - they just care about money. 'You get all these 16 and 18-year-olds who think they're going to be the next Britney Spears... They think they're going to be stars but we all know they aren't.' Delving deeper into Los Angeles' seedy underworld, Harris came across tales of paedophilia, rape, human trafficking and child abduction. The latter proved something of a bombshell, so much so that it forms the premise of the controversial Abducted, a relentlessly black eye-opener of a film that offers a glimpse of Tinsel Town at odds with its glamorous image. 'It is very shocking,' he admits. 'I spent a whole night in Hollywood with Saving Innocence and in one night, I came across paeodophila, abduction, rape, trafficking and a story about two girls just being taken off the . street.' Dream: Many teens head to Hollywood in the hopes of one day joining Angelina Jolie and co at the Oscars . He adds: 'People did find the film very controversial because it's so dark and near to the edge but I wanted to go right near to the mark . and show people what this is about. 'I didn't want to make a fairytale . movie - I wanted people to really understand what Hollywood was really like.' Incredible as it might seem, Harris and Saving Innocence insist every episode seen on screen is based on real life; a claim that becomes all the more believable when listening to Dominique and fellow survivor, Keila McCain. Keila, who is now in her twenties, was rescued by workers from the charity after being plunged into a life of vice when she was just 12 years old. 'I was twelve when I became involved with sex trafficking,' she explains. 'When . I was 18, it was the last time I got arrested for prostitution. Hard: Keila McCain was trafficked from the age of 12 but has now escaped from her life as a prostitute . Tragic: According to Saving Innocence, up to 100,000 people are trafficked in the USA each year . 'I . was stuck in sex trafficking for six years, but that doesn’t define who I . am today.' Amazingly, Keila repeatedly slipped through the net and was the victim of numerous missed chances to intervene, although that, in part, was thanks to her pimp's insistence on moving her around the USA. 'I was . exposed to sex trafficking when I was about 12, but I didn’t meet my . pimp until I was about fifteen years old,' she remembers. 'We met one day on the . streets, and he just started walking with me and trying to talk to me . but I wouldn’t give him any eye contact, and then he was like -  ""oh you . must have a pimp cause you not talking to me"" and I looked at him and . he said ""so what are you doing out here?"" and we just went from there. 'Me and other girls worked all night, every night for him, with him . moving us between states the whole year.' Star: Director Mark Harris (right) also appears in the film, which is released on the 17th March . She added: 'You’re risking so much; your life your freedom and your body and . your degrading yourself in how others look at you.' Keila is now off the streets and has found an apartment with the help of Saving Innocence but for other girls like her, the nightmare continues. 'I’m proud of myself because a year ago I couldn’t see this happening – . all I saw was the streets,' adds Keila. 'But my past doesn’t take away my present. I’m . going fast and strong and independent and now I finally feel worthy of love.' Abducted is released on 17th March.

"PUBLISHED: . 04:53 EST, 8 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 08:54 EST, 8 March 2014 . Doctors treating Michael Schumacher have told the Formula One legend's family that the chances of recovery are now so slim that only 'a miracle' can save him. The 45-year-old seven-time world champion has been in an artificially induced coma for 10 weeks since badly injuring his brain during a low-speed ski accident in the French Alps on December 29.  Most artificial comas last for a period of two to three weeks. His management team, led by spokeswoman Sabine Kehm, insist that he remains in the 'wake up' phase of his treatment as doctors continue to decrease the powerful narcotics that have kept him unconscious. Coma: Doctors have told the family of Michael Schumacher 'only a miracle can save him' Official news about his condition is minimal: but sources close to the family say the prognosis for Schumacher could not be worse. 'He is in terrible shape but until the family issue a statement we cannot write about it,' said one senior German journalist. 'The family have, we are told, been informed that only a miracle can bring him back now.' However, Italian sports newspaper La . Gazzetta dello Sport is claiming that Schumacher is . no longer on a ventilator and is now breathing independently. Focus magazine reported a fortnight ago that the wake-up phase had been stopped due to complications and that he was placed back in the coma. That was denied by his agent Sabine Kehm although experts say that such a super-fit individual as Schumacher would have expelled all the drugs from his body by now, and that if he was going to wake up, he would have done so already. This week was a vital one for Schumacher - doctors were hoping for a sign that he was aware of his environment. Italian sports newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport is claiming that the seven-time world champion is no longer on a ventilator and is now breathing independently . Finish line: Schumacher took the chequered flag 91 times during a glittering career - the last one coming at the Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai in October 2006 . Listen up: Schumacher and Felipe Massa in the Ferrari pits ahead of the Italian Grand Prix in 2008 . They look for a fluttering of eyelids or a movement of fingers that is more than a reflex nerve twitch. 'This . has not happened,' said another source close to the family. 'On Sunday . his wife Corinna spent her 45th birthday at his bedside with their . children Gina Marie and Mick, his brother Ralf and his father Rolf . Schumacher. 'They talked and talked and prayed for him to acknowledge their presence. But he remains comatose with tubes feeding him, supplying him with air, giving him medicine and removing waste from his body. 'The doctors have given it to them straight. There is little hope left that he will come out of this. 'Miracles happen, of course, and as a wealthy man he has the best care money can buy. But all the money in the world cannot fix what has happened to him.' Three times daily Schumacher's joints and muscles are massaged to prevent atrophy and bed sores. Hero: Schumacher, celebrating after the 2003 Japanese Grand Prix, was worshiped during his time at Ferrari . This week was a vital one for Schumacher (pictured here in 2012) - two months into his coma, doctors were hoping for a sign that he was aware of his environment . And he's off: Schumacher made his Formula One debut as a Jordan driver at the 1991 Belgian Grand Prix . The coma suppressed his swallowing reflex, pain perception and his respiratory drive. He has to be acutely monitored around the clock during this wake-up phase to see if such things are returning naturally. Experts say that perhaps the greatest risk of all facing Schumacher in his prone position is pneumonia. The lack of a competent swallowing mechanism can make saliva run into the lungs and trigger the potentially lethal respiratory infection.  He has already had - and conquered - one lung infection. His blood is also thinned to prevent thrombosis and he is regularly turned and even stood straight up at times to keep it flowing. Hobby: Schumacher, pictured here in 2005, was injured in a skiing accident on December 29 . Rescue mission: Schumacher was taken to the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire in Grenoble after his accident in the French Alps on December 29 . He lies on a special air-filled mattress to prevent pressure sores and his urinary tract is under constant vigilance because of the danger of waste bacteria entering the bloodstream and causing a potentially fatal infection. Gary Hartstein, a former F1 doctor, wrote on Sunday: 'The majority of the patients that come out alive from a coma after this amount of time suffer severe disabilities.' He and others say the supposed mouth movements that Schumacher's former team-mate Felipe Massa saw were probably nothing more than pure nerve reflexes that repeatedly occur in coma patients and not conscious movements. The beginning: Schumacher's first victory was in 1992 at the Belgian Grand Prix . End of an era: Schumacher completed his final race at the Brazilian Grand Prix in 2012 .","F1 driver has been in artificially induced coma for 10 weeks .

Members of the two religions - at odds for more than a thousand years - are singing with one voice to condemn the £75million film Noah for its take on the Biblical hero. The blockbuster has already been banned in three Arab countries after religious leaders complained that it depicted the Biblical figure - who is also a prophet in the Koran. Fatwa: Noah, a blockbuster starring Russell Crowe, pictured, has been banned in three Arab countries and three more could soon follow after a fatwa was issued against it by leading figures in Sunni Islam . God's messenger: Noah, said to have built an ark (pictured) which saved the human and animal worlds from a great flood, features in Christianity, Judaism and Islam, but depicting Allah's messengers is banned . Due to première later this month, the film will not show in Qatar, Bahrain or the United Arab Emirates . and several other countries are expected to follow suit. But . it appears that America's devout Christians are also annoyed about the . portrayal of the antediluvian patriarch, claiming after test screenings . that director Darren Aronofsky had made him 'too dark'. In . exchange for his eight-figure budget, the auteur filmmaker was forced . to allow backer Paramount to conduct as many as half a dozen test . screenings to test the waters while work was still in progress. A . representative of an Australian pentecostal megachurch present for one . warned The Hollywood Reporter: 'If you're expecting it to be word for . word from the Bible, you're in for a shock. 'There can be an opportunity for Christians to take offence.' Another . viewer at a separate test screening was more blunt, saying it depictued . Noah as a 'crazy, irrational, religious nut' who is obsessed with . apparently modern day problems like overpopulation. Fatwa: Cairo's al-Azhar (which includes the mosque pictured left) issued a fatwa, which is a ruling under Islamic law, saying the film starring Russell Crowe (right) as Noah was a 'clear violation' of their teachings . Epic: The film is due to premiere in the U.S. on March 28 and was due to air in Egypt in the near future .

The murder trial is underway of a private school student who allegedly beat his father to death with a baseball bat before using money he robbed from him to go on a two-day shopping spree. Matthew Nellessen, who was 19 at the time, is accused of recruiting three known Chicago gang-bangers to help him rob his father George Nellessen of his life savings on April 12, 2011. After tying the elder Nellessen to a chair, authorities say Matthew Nellessen put duct tape over his eyes and 'swung that bat as hard as he could at his fatherâ€™s head a number of times'. Brutal attack: Matthew Nellessen, left, had been out of jail for less than a month before he allegedly beat his father George, right, to death with a baseball bat . Authorities say Nellessen recruited Marlon Green (center) to help rob his father. Green then recruited Azari Braden (left) and Braden's brother Armon (right) After beating him with the bat, authorities say Nellessen then stabbed his father in the throat, cutting his own hand in the process. Prosecutors said on Wednesday that Nellessen, who had recently been released from jail, had planned to rob his 55-year-old father, whom he believed owed him money. Prosecutors allege that Nellessen recruited gang member Marlon Green - whom he met while serving time in Cook County Jail after violating his probation following a conviction for burglary. Green, authorities claim, then recruited two brothers - Armon and Azari Braden - to help carry out the robbery. In exchange for their help, Nellessen promised to split the proceeds of the robbery with his alleged accomplices. On the day of the murder, authorities say Green and the Braden brothers drove to Nellessen's comfortable suburban home armed with a BB gun that resembled an actual pistol. Green and Armon Braden entered the house with Nellessen as Azari Braden waited in a getaway car. Authorities claim the three men were looking for financial information they could use to drain George Nellessen's bank account. 'Matt (Nellessen) was happy they brought the BB gun,' Cook County Assistant State's Attorney MariaMcCarthy told jurors, according to a report in the Chicago Tribune. 'It would make things easier.' As the three men were ransacking the home, George Nellessen came home from work. Green, Nellessen and Armon Braden then tied him to a chair in the family room and took $800 in cash from his wallet. They also forced him to sign a blank check, which Green later made out to Matthew Nellessen for $100,00. The trio then used George Nellessen's laptop to to transfer $100,000 from his account to his son's. 'Matthew wanted that money more than anything in the world,' McCarthy told jurors. As the three men began to leave the home, authorities say Matthew Nellessen stopped them. 'He . said, ""This is personal,"" and got a (baseball) bat, duct taped (George . Nellessen's) eyes, stuffed a towel in his mouth and swung that bat as . hard as he could at his fatherâ€™s head a number of times,' McCarthy said. He then retrieved a steak knife and stabbed his father in the throat. Crime scene: George Nellessen returned to his home (pictured) to find his son and accomplices waiting to rob him in 2011 . Green and Nellessen then stole his father's car as the Braden brothers drove home in a separate vehicle. After allegedly beating his father to death, Nellessen and Green checked into the Amber Inn on the South Side of Chicago. The following day, Nellessen brought his girlfriend to the hotel and took her to a movie - using the money he stole from his father to pay the bills. George Nellessen's body wasn't discovered until April 14, when a friend stopped by his home. The friend then confronted Matthew Nellessen about murdering his father. The suspect fled, leading police on a car chase through the suburbs. Nellessen's attorneys say prosecutors have it all wrong - they say it was Green, a convicted felon, who hatched the plan to murder George Nellessen. 'The original plan was to rob and kill a rich white guy and the rich . white kid,' Assistant Public Defender Dan Naranjo told the jury. 'Marlon Green took the life of George . Nellessen.' Nellessen, now 22, and the Braden brothers each have been charged with murder, armed robbery and home invasion. Green cut a deal with prosecutors that allows him to avoid a murder conviction - Green agreed to testify against Nellessen in exchange for an 18-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to an armed robbery charge. In testimony on Wednesday, Nellessen's sister, Lisa, explained that the money Nellessen believed his father owed him were Social Security benefits left when the siblings' mother died in 2004. According to Lisa Nellessen, the money was intended to help pay college tuition for the children as well as a car for her brother and his private high school tuition. Nellessen has prior convictions for burglary, drug possession and check forgery, according to the Chicago Tribune. Nellessen had been out of the Cook County Jail for less than a month before he allegedly murdered his father.","Matthew Nellessen 'swung that bat as hard as he could at his fatherâ€™s head a number of times'

Claims: Catriona Carter Jonas, the former events coordinator at Kellogg College, Oxford, told a tribunal she was called a 'wrinkly old bag' by a manager . An Oxford University events co-ordinator was described by her managers as a 'wrinkly old bag', an employment tribunal was told. Catriona Carter Jonas, 53, said she received 'nasty treatment' from her superiors while working at the prestigious Kellogg College and was so depressed she would 'cry herself to sleep'. Details of the alleged bullying emerged at Reading Tribunal Centre where Miss Carter Jonas is suing the Chancellor, Masters and Scholars of the University for discrimination on age grounds, unfair dismissal and the payment of outstanding wages. Miss Carter Jonas, who worked at the college for six years, told the tribunal she had been bullied from January 2011 and once she left had 'no confidence in herself'. She alleges former line manager Sarah Gauntlett called her a 'wrinkly old bag' and asked if she was strong enough to move furniture for events. When Donna Lipsky took over as her manager in January 2012, Miss Carter Jonas said: 'As soon as Donna started her role it was clear that her intention was to manage me out.' She claimed Mrs Lipsky was overly argumentative in a meeting shortly after taking over and refused to listen to Miss Carter Jonas’ concerns about her previous manager’s behaviour. A month later, Miss Carter Jonas, from Wantage, Oxfordshire, said she walked past Mrs Lipsky’s office and overheard her saying to a colleague: 'We need someone cheaper, younger, stronger.' 'I was the only member of staff that had to move furniture around for events, therefore I needed to be reasonably strong and that is why I believe that comment was made about me,' she told the hearing. She said that Mrs Lipsky attempted to increase her workload by up to 80 per cent without any recognition. 'She was trying to make my job more difficult for me so that I would make mistakes or resign,' she added. Judge Robin Lewis heard that she was . told to 'f**k off' by bursary staff member Samantha Williams, and heard Mrs . Lipsky had claimed Miss Carter Jonas lied about taking time off sick . with suspected appendicitis in April 2012. Allegations: The hearing at Reading Tribunal Centre was also told that a senior member of staff said Miss Carter Jonas would 'sit on people' until she broke them . In June 2012, Miss Carter Jonas was taken to a disciplinary hearing for poor performance by Mrs Lipsky, which she labelled 'very strange' as the accusations were 'petty' or 'not true'. She had previously been subject to a similar hearing in 2011, which she did not dispute. Miss Carter Jonas was then given a final written warning, meaning she needed daily meetings with her manager to monitor performance. 'These were never good or constructive and I was either treated with contempt or completely ignored,' she added. Prestigious: She was the events co-ordinator at Kellogg College for six years before leaving last year . Miss Carter Jonas submitted a grievance against Mrs Lipsky in July 2012 and appealed her warning, claiming two other employees had complained about her manager at the time. Judge Lewis heard that further health problems followed as the disciplinary and grievance process continued. 'I was depressed and would cry myself to sleep on most nights. I was suffering from regular panic attacks, she said. She claimed the grievance was not investigated properly and appealed its dismissal, but that was also rejected. University administration: Miss Carter Jonas is suing the Chancellor, Masters and Scholars of the University of Oxford for discrimination on age grounds, unfair dismissal and the payment of outstanding wages . 'The result of the appeal was the last straw, it forced me to resign. I couldn’t go back to Kellogg, I had no confidence in myself,' she said. Alice Carse, representing Oxford University, told the hearing that Miss Carter Jonas had been mistaken regarding Mr Fraser’s comments that Mrs Lipsky would 'sit on people'. She added that Miss Carter Jonas, referred to by colleagues as Mimi in some evidence, was 'making something out of nothing and that Mrs Lipsky had not in fact threatened her with dismissal in their January 2012 meeting. 'Did you ever consider that what Keith Fraser told you about her was untrue and was part of his own agenda?' she asked, to which Miss Carter Jonas said she took it as true. Speaking of her original meeting in 2012 with Mrs Lipsky, Miss Carter Jonas said: 'Donna wagged her finger repeatedly at me, banned me from using Gabriele Del Monte, IT officer, to help me move furniture, changed my work hours and threatened to dismiss me by asking ""do you still want this job?"" in front of former manager Sarah Gauntlett. The tribunal is expected to conclude today. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Catriona Cater Jonas, 53 told hearing she would 'cry herself to sleep'

Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta announced plans to build the Islamic museum and study centre during a meeting with the Emir of Qatar. Letta, who is in the Middle East to drum up investment for Italy’s woe-begotten state industries, said the leaders had ‘made a commitment to explore the opportunity to build an Islamic museum in Venice on the Grand Canal.’ Venetians have voiced their concerns over plans to build an Islamic museum near the Palazzo delle Pescheria on the Grand Canal by the Rialto bridge (pictured) The centre is set to be housed in one of Venice’s most prestigious and beautiful vantage points, the Palazzo delle Pescheria on the Grand Canal by the Rialto bridge.

Governor of the Veneto region, Luca Zaia, said he was ‘surprised that Letta has money to throw away' on an Islamic Museum, when Venice itself is at constant risk of collapsing into the sea. Massimo Bitonci, a senator in the anti-immigration Northern League party, said Italy needed the funding to tackle more pressing economic issues. He said: ‘Let me send the premier a clear message. 'We don’t want an Islamic centre in Venice. Letta would do better to concentrate on the economic crisis a instead of thinking about how to favour and spread Islam.

Angela Cobbina, 41, who was Dutch banking giant ABN Amro's top lawyer in Britain, claimed she suffered a miscarriage due to the stress of being hounded out of her job and subjected to discrimination . A top lawyer at a leading global bank who claimed she suffered a miscarriage due to stress after being subjected to bullying and intimidating remarks has lost her discrimination claims. Angela Cobbina, 41, said she was hounded out of her job at ABN Amro - where she was the Dutch banking giant’s top lawyer - after UK chief executive Paul Schuilwerve made repeated racist comments that led to her being 'systematically frozen out'. And she claimed the stress of her ordeal may have contributed to her suffering a miscarriage early last year. Ms Cobbina was suing the bank for a reported £300,000 for sex, race and religious discrimination over claims she was a victim of a 'campaign' of harassment. Today the Central London Employment Tribunals ruled against her on the claims of discrimination but in her favour on a separate claim of unfair dismissal. In her claim Ms Cobbina, from Streatham in south London, alleged Mr Schuilwerve began his racist abuse the first time he met her on 17 September 2012. In the following 12 months she was then the 'target of a campaign designed to remove or drive me from the business. 'I was variously excluded, overlooked, targeted for undue criticism, including in connection with my performance, conduct, appearance and personal belief, and otherwise treated differently from my colleagues.' In the midst of the alleged racist campaign against her, Ms Cobbina discovered she was pregnant during the Christmas break 2012 and was 'ecstatic' at the prospect of becoming a mother for the first time. She added she was determined to put the bad blood between her and her boss behind her but at a meeting with Mr Schuilwerve on 30 January she claims she was 'bullied' and 'intimidated' and she left the office feeling 'very down and worried about my work'. She added: 'That night I experienced severe stomach pain and miscarried my baby. I will never know for certain whether these two events are related. But I connected them in my mind at the time and still do.' UK chief executive Paul Schuilwerve was alleged to have made racist and sexist comments. He claimed that he has a 'zero tolerance attitude to discrimination and harassment issues'. Right, ABN Amro's London office . But Mr Schuilwerve strongly denied allegations of racism and in his witness statement said he has a 'zero tolerance attitude to discrimination and harassment issues' and found the allegations 'deeply hurtful'. Mr Schuilwerve was quizzed about his attitude to race after it emerged he 'liked' a petition to keep the Dutch 'Black Pete' Christmas parades on Facebook. This traditional event involves people ‘blacking up’ and wearing bright red lipstick to start the Christmas season. He explained that the parade was a Dutch tradition and he supported it because he has three young children and that 91 per cent of the Dutch population also supported it despite the UN branding it racist. Ms Cobbina was told in February 2013 the bank was considering axing her position as part of restructuring, and in September 2013 informed her she was being made redundant. An ABN AMRO spokesperson said: 'We are pleased the judgement supports our strong belief that the various allegations of discrimination on grounds of sex, race and religion were entirely groundless. 'ABN AMRO is committed to diversity across its global operations and at every level of the organisation.' The panel delivered a summary judgement and will provide the parties with its detailed decision at a later date.

An angry mother has criticised the NHS after she was told that her four-year-old could face obesity problems despite him having serious dietary issues. Kirsty Shedlock’s son Jack has been in and out of hospital since birth with swollen bowels, causing his weight to fluctuate. The Chadderton boy, who goes to St Luke’s Primary School, has to follow a strict diet to control the problem. Angry: Jack Shedlock's mother Kirsty is furious that her local NHS have warned her he could be at risk of becoming obese even though he is on a special diet because of a bowel condition . Four-year-old Jack Shedlock has had swollen bowels since birth . Kirsty, 26, was shocked when she was told the news after Jack was weighed and measured as part of a scheme with Oldham Community Health Service. She said: ‘The first thing I knew was when I received a letter saying he was overweight and was more likely to be obese when he grew up. ‘I wouldn’t mind if he was eating loads of rubbish but he is on a strict diet because of his health problems. ‘I’ve asked them to take him off their database but they have refused. I’m appalled, it’s disgusting. It’s my little boy who’s suffering.’ Marie Forshaw, Oldham Community Health Service director at Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust, said: ‘Children are routinely weighed and measured but all parents are given the opportunity to opt out if they wish. ‘We apologise for any distress caused.’ Kirsty said: ‘They said you had to sign the letter if you didn’t want it to happen, but it should be the other way around. It’s quite sneaky I think.’ Ian Walsh, the headmaster at St Luke’s, said that the letters were written by the health authority and merely handed out by the school.

He was said to be a known prankster - and Walter George Bruhl Jr. had one final laugh planned for his family following his death. The 80-year-old, who died on Sunday, had secretly written his own obituary, which relatives found after he passed away. His grandson Sam Bruhl posted the epic essay, which is both heartfelt and hilarious to Reddit on Monday, causing a stream of comments from users who were touched by Walter's story. One Reddit user wrote: 'Great obituaries are ones when after you read it, even if you didn't know the person, you felt a pang of loss and some disappointment of never having had the chance to meet that person. this (sic) was one of those obituaries.' Scroll down to read Obituary in full . Walter George Bruhl Jr., seen here with his wife Helene, was a beloved member of the family and his relatives mourned his passing. But making preparations for what needed to be done next, his family stumbled upon an obituary for Walter that he had written himself . Walter's grandson, Sam Bruhl, made the amazing obituary public bty posting on his Facebook (pictured) and then to website Reddit . Walter George Bruhl Jr. (right) pictured in a photo with his grandson Sam Bruhl (second right) and other family members . While most obits are heartfelt accounts of the deceased individual’s achievements in life and the loved ones they left behind, Bruhl’s includes anecdotes about what he's leaving behind. 'Walt was preceded in death by his tonsils and adenoids in 1935, a spinal disc in 1974, a large piece of his thyroid gland in 1988, and his prostate on March 27th 2000,' he wrote. Even his wife of 57 years, Helene, wasn't safe, with Walter poking fun at her love of fur. Arguably the best part is a joke about the viewing, according to iVillage. 'There will be no viewing since his wife refuses to honor his request to have him standing in the corner of the room with a glass of Jack Daniels in his hand so that he would appear natural to visitors,' Walter wrote. Bruhl ended the essay with a request to honour and remember him through 'unexpected acts of kindness'. One last laugh: Walter George Bruhl Jr. had a great sense of humor - and it shows in his self-penned obituary (below) Here is the obituary in full: . Walter George Bruhl Jr of Newark and Dewey Beach DE is a dead person, he is no more, he is bereft of life, he is deceased, he has wrung down the curtain and gone to join the choir invisible, he has expired and gone to meet his maker. He drifted off this mortal coil on _____________ at __________ at his home in ________. His spirit was released from his worn out shell of a body and is now exploring the universe. He was surrounded by his loving wife of ______ years, Helene Sellers Bruhl, who will now be able to purchase the mink coat which he had always refused her because he believed only minks should wear mink, his two sons, their wives, and his four grandchildren. Walt was preceded in death by his tonsils and adenoids in 1935, a spinal disc in 1974, a large piece of his thyroid gland in 1988, and his prostate on March 27th 2000. He was born in Phila. PA on April 20th 1933 at 10:38 PM and weighed in at a healthy 7lbs. 4oz. and was 22” long, to Blanche Buckman Bruhl and Walter George Bruhl. He drifted through the Philadelphia Public School System from 1937 through 1951, graduating, to his mother’s great relief, from John Bartram High School in June of 1951. Walter was a Marine Corps Veteran of the Korean War having served from October of 1951 to September of 1954 with overseas duty in Japan from June of 1953 till August of 1954. He attained the rank of Sergeant. He chose this path because of Hollywood propaganda, to which he succumbed as a child during WWII, and his cousin Ella, who joined the corps in 1943. He served an electronics apprenticeship at the Phila. Naval Yard from 1956 till 1961, operated Atlantic Automotive Service Stations in Wilmington during 1961 and 1962 and was employed by the late great DuPont Co. from 1962 thru 1993 (very few people who knew him would say he worked for DuPont and he always claimed he had only been hired to fill a position). He started at the Chestnut Run Site as a flunky in the weave area of the Textile Fibers Dept., and then was promoted to research assistant, where he stayed from 1953 through 1972. In 1972 he accepted a position as an equipment service representative with the Photo Products Dept. at the old DuPont Airport Site (now Barley Mill Plaza). In 1973 he was promoted to Manufacturing Engineering Technologist and was employed in that capacity until, after 31 years with The Co., he was given a fine anniversary dinner and a token gift and then ‘downsized’ in Dec. of 1993. He was rehired as a contract employee in June of 1994, doing the same job that he had been ‘downsized’ from, and stayed until July of 1995. He started his own contract business and worked at Litho Tech Ltd. from 1996 till 1999. There will be no viewing since his wife refuses to honor his request to have him standing in the corner of the room with a glass of Jack Daniels in his hand so that he would appear natural to visitors. Cremation will take place at the family’s convenience and his ashes will be kept in an urn until they get tired of having it around. What’s a Grecian Urn? Oh, about 200 drachmas a week. Everyone who remembers him is asked to celebrate Walt’s life in their own way, raising a glass of their favorite drink in his memory would be quite appropriate. Instead of flowers, Walt would hope that you will do an unexpected and unsolicited act of kindness for some poor unfortunate soul in his name.","Walter George Bruhl Jr.died on Sunday at the age of 80 .

A supermarket price war on an unprecedented scale was under way last night with the prospect of permanent cuts in the cost of many basic foods. It was triggered as Morrisons announced discounts worth £1billion over the next three years in a bid to fight off budget rivals Aldi and Lidl. Asda responded immediately with an advertising campaign claiming to undercut Morrisons and promising big savings on major brands. Scroll down for video . Trouble: Morrisons is set to slash its prices after recording a loss of £176million last year . Tesco and Sainsbury’s will almost certainly be forced to follow suit. The . cost of some everyday essentials could fall by up to a quarter as the . ‘big four’ take on Aldi and Lidl, who have grabbed a huge chunk of their . market share in recent years in what has been the biggest change in . grocery shopping habits since the dawn of the supermarket age more than . 50 years ago. Last night . Aldi raised the stakes further with a promise to save shoppers 35 per . cent on their weekly shop. Fears of the effect of a price war on profits . gripped the City yesterday, wiping £2billion of the combined share . value of Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons. Morrisons . shares were down more than 10 per cent at one point. Profits at Asda, . which is part of the world’s biggest retailer, US giant Walmart, are . also likely to suffer. Bosses . at Morrisons believe only a fundamental shift to lower prices will . guarantee the chain’s future after it posted losses of £176million. Asda, Tesco and Sainsbury’s all pledge they will match Morrisons prices, . so will inevitably be drawn into a price war. Tesco . has made its own price cuts in recent weeks, with the cost of a . four-pint carton of milk cut from £1.39 to £1 and reductions on some . fruit and vegetables. Battle: Aldi and Lidl have been gaining in market share thanks to increasingly price-conscious customers . Tesco’s cuts had already seen it promise £200million in short-term savings but will now have to go much further. Retail experts at one City firm described the scale of the reductions promised by Morrisons as like ‘getting the bazooka out’. The . firm, founded in Bradford in 1899, admitted that the price cuts will . hit profits by more than £300million a year over the next three years. But . chief executive Dalton Philips said the ‘big four’ chains had lost . millions of customers and billions of pounds in sales to Aldi and Lidl, . and needed to catch up. The . grocery sector is facing the biggest structural shift ‘since the 1950s . and the advent of supermarkets’ as shoppers – even those not struggling . financially – turn to budget stores, he said. ‘The biggest challenge . that we face is that there has been a fundamental change in how . consumers view discounters. ‘They are no longer going to them out of . necessity. The perception has changed and there is a new price norm.’ A . study suggested this week that the big four have lost sales worth . £4.4billion a year over the past three years. The cost of living squeeze . saw millions of middle-income shoppers switch to the budget chains – . and many have stayed. Sales . at Morrisons are down by 3.2 per cent in the past year, while Aldi’s are . up a remarkable 33.5 per cent and Lidl’s 16.5 per cent. Mr . Philips said: ‘We are going to lower our prices on a permanent . basis.The rules have changed and we must change too. It is absolutely . critical that we begin winning again in our core supermarkets. To do . that we must compete on price.’ The money to cover the loss in profits will come partly from the sale of property thought to be worth £1billion. A . snapshot survey of prices at Morrisons and Aldi yesterday, suggests it . will have to make significant reductions to match its German-owned . budget rival. Plunge: The company's share price fell by 10 per cent this morning after the loss was announced . For example, Aldi charges £5 for a 200g jar of Nescafe . Gold Blend, which is £6.58 at Morrisons and the other mainstream chains. A large white sliced loaf is just 55p at Aldi versus 65p at Morrisons . and anything up to £1 at the other giants. A . 500g pack of fusilli pasta is 49p, against 95p, while a 1kg bag of . basmati rice is £1.29, compared with £1.79. A 500g box of corn flakes is . 99p at Aldi versus £1.45 at Morrisons. Morrisons . is to press ahead with the roll-out of its online shopping service and . the opening of small convenience stores in a bid to catch up with its . major rivals, who have cashed in by offering home deliveries and filling . high streets and petrol stations with smaller stores. Its . annual loss of £176million included one-off costs of £903million. But . underlying profits were down 13 per cent to £785million and these are . expected to fall by more than half to fund the price cuts. David . Cumming of Standard Life, who is responsible for investing billions of . pounds of pension funds, said: ‘Investors know a price war is coming. ‘Aldi . and Lidl are growing shares at double digit while the majors are losing . market share and they have to do something about it. If they are . relatively expensive – and the customers know it – they need a price . reset, or price war, whatever you want to call it, before they can move . forward in terms of sales.’ Richard . Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers, said: . ‘The discount supermarkets have become a thorn in the side for the . bigger players. ‘Morrison’s has now decided that it is time to revitalise the business, which will inevitably come at a cost.’ The . reputation of Aldi and Lidl were enhanced last night as both picked up . prizes at the Oracle Retail Week Awards. Lidl won own brand range of the . year, while Aldi was named retailer of the year. Success: Morrisons expanded under the watch of Sir Ken Morrison, son of the firm's founder . Morrisons is one of the country's oldest supermarkets, having started trading as a market stall in Bradford, West Yorkshire in 1899. However, it did not become a major player on a national scale until a decade ago, when it took over the Safeway supermarket chain. The company, whose full title is Wm Morrison, was named after its founder William Morrison, who sold egg and butter in Bradford's Rawson Market. Its major expansion came under the founder's son, Sir Ken Morrison, who took over in 1952 at the age of 21 and remains president of the company. He opened Bradford's first modern-style grocery store, and in 1967 floated the firm on the London Stock Exchange. In 2004, Morrisons expanded beyond its home region by buying Safeway and taking over its stock of nearly 500 stores. The company now operates more than 550 branches around the UK, and is the country's fourth-biggest supermarket with a market share of around 11 per cent. However, it has run into difficulties in recent years after being crowded out by discount retailers and the rise of online shopping.","Firm lost £176million due to one-off costs and falling market share .
