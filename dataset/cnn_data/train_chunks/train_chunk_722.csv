Turning a blind eye: Meredith Yayanos was sexually harassed while waiting for a bus in San Francisco last week and when she asked the driver for help, he ignored her . A Bay Area woman threatened with rape while waiting for a bus in downtown San Francisco last week was refused help when her shuttle finally arrived in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Meredith Yayanos had taken the bus into San Francisco to attend a concert December 16, and was waiting for her bus back to Sausilto around midnight when a stranger invaded her personal space, looked her up and down, and asked: 'Hey baby, how you doin?' When she refused to engage the man, he became infuriated and refused to leave her alone. Ms Yayanos, a musician, detailed the terrifying experience in a blog post, writing that the man called her a b**** and a stuck-up ho before moving on to scarier threats. As he got closer and closer, the man threatened to beat and rape her - at one point unzipping his pants. 'I am going to slap you, b****,' he said. 'You deserve to get raped. You deserve a d*** in your ***. Stuck-up ugly s***. You’re gonna get raped because you’re a b**** and b****s deserve whatever they get.' Ms Yayano's phone had died, so she couldn't call for help. But since she was in a brightly lit area, she decided to hold her ground until the bus came. When it finally arrived she rushed on, told the driver about the man's threats and asked him not to let him on board. Bad end to the night: Yayanos had attended a concert in San Francisco Monday night and was waiting for a Golden Gate Transit bus back to Sausilito when the incident happened . Approached: A man came up to her at the bus stop at Mission and Fifth in downtown San Francisco, calling her babe and asking her 'How you doin?' Her aggressor then pushed past her and sat down in the front seat. 'Pay this b**** no mind, she's a crazy-*** prostitute' he said, adding 'she been harassing ME.' Instead of ordering the man off the bus or calling the police, the driver ignored Ms Yayanos, and even shook her harasser's hand, laughing along with him. 'I was stunned' Ms Yayanos wrote. 'I stood at the head of the bus and kept saying ""why aren't you listening to me? Please call the cops. Don't let him stay on the bus.""' 'Sit your ass down, b****,' her harasser said. The man then seemed to imply that she was racist, announcing that he was moving to the back of the bus 'where I belong'. Threatened: When she refused to acknowledge his advances, the man became agitated and threatened to beat and  rape her - even going so far as to unzip his pants . She stood at the front of the bus until the driver ordered her to sit down. In her seat, Ms Yayano continued to ask why he wouldn't help but was met with silence. Before getting off at her stop, Ms Yayano wrote down the bus number since the driver refused to give out his name. The next morning, she called the Golden Gate Transit hotline to file a complaint. In her post, she wrote that she doesn't want to get the driver fired, but hopes this incident will lead to change in protocol within the transportation organization. 'He seemed young, totally clueless and lacking in empathy, but not actively unkind,' she wrote. Helen Moore, Golden Gate Transit's . customer relations supervisor, called Ms Yayanos the day she filed the . complaint to tell her the company was investigating the matter 'at the . highest level of our organization'. Two days later, the transit company updated Ms Yayanos on Twitter saying the bus driver admitted 'proper action wasn't taken' and that appropriate disciplinary action was underway. Ms Yayanos tweeted that she was grateful for the apology, but stressed she didn't want to get the driver fired and that disciplinary action might be scapegoating and wouldn't fix a possible systemic problem. The company tweeted that the problem was not systemic and that all of the drivers receive extensive training, which the driver in question did not follow.","Meredith Yayanos took a bus into San Francisco last week to attend a concert .

If you're still frantically searching for the perfect Christmas present for a little girl in your life, your prayers may have been answered - as long as you have £9,000 to spare. Leonard Martin, 68, has put this elaborate Georgian manor dolls' house - complete with a Swarovski crystal chandelier, hand-stitched carpets and marble flooring - on sale after spending an incredible 26 years working on it. The model maker estimates he has spent £6,000 - and more than a third of his life - working on the model. Leonard Martin, 68, has spent 26 years - more than a third of his life- working on this elaborate dolls' house, which he has named Langdon House . The model maker says he has spent £6,000 on the Georgian manor model - and wants to sell it for £9,000 . It all started for Mr Martin in 1987 when, bored at work, he doodled a picture of his ‘perfect home’ on a scrap of paper - and started working on 'Langdon House' in miniature size. He has worked on the house, which is 6ft 2ins long and 3ft 6ins tall, for between five and 12 hours a day since starting. The miniature property has two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a kitchen, a sitting room, a dining room and a hallway all filled with tiny furniture. There are miniature beds, sofas, . cupboards, baths, toilets and even tiny oil replica paintings - including one of the Mona Lisa. Mr Martin, 68, began working on the design in 1987 when, bored at work, he doodled his 'perfect home' Langdon House comes complete with Swarovski crystal chandeliers, hand-stitched carpets and marble flooring . It takes four men to lift the massive dolls' house, which is 6ft 2ins long and 3ft 6ins tall . Mr Martin, who used to own a military memorabilia shop and lives in Charlton Marshall near Blandford, Dorset, said: ‘It was all my own design and was made to look like a Georgian house and I started building it in the shop. ‘When it was quiet I would work on it and some people would joke and say that if anyone was to visit my shop they would end up being gold leafed themselves. ‘I probably spent anywhere between five and 12 hours a day and it was to commemorate my mum, Pearl, and my brother Kenneth, who both died. ‘It is all built to a scale of 1:12 and about 90 per cent of it is handmade - it isn't really a dolls house but more of an architectural build. ‘Some people who see pictures up close actually think it is real.’ There are miniature beds, sofas, cupboards, baths, toilets, and even tiny oil paintings that look like their original counterparts - including the Mona Lisa . After moving six times since he started working on the manor, Mr Martin has been finishing it off in a workshop at the end of his garden . The miniature property has two bedrooms, two bathrooms (pictured), a kitchen, sitting room, dining room, and hallway all filled with tiny furniture . Some of the items in the house were purchased from dolls' house furniture makers and other pieces were hand-made by Mr Martin, including a huge banquet of miniature food. He made meats, bread, cakes and pies from clay and then baked them in the oven before painstakingly painting them to look realistic. Mr Martin also spent months ensuring the decorations look perfect by coating the plaster ceilings with 24ct gold leaf and laying individual planks of wood for the floor. He even spent hours working on the outside by affixing 720 quoin stones and over 4,000 mock stones made from cardboard.

A man accused of murdering his wife and two young daughters earlier this year is still on the run as police continue to comb a densely forested region of northern California where he is believed to be hiding. Shane Franklyn Miller, 45, is the sole suspect in the shooting deaths of his wife Sandra Miller, 34, and their two daughters, Shelby Ann, eight, and Shasta, four. During an intensive search of the remote, undeveloped area of redwoods and towering mountains in coastal Humbolt County in June, police discovered an underground fortress containing an arsenal of rifles, shotguns and handguns. Wanted: Police are still searching for Shane Franklyn Miller, 45, who is wanted in connection to the killings of his wife, 34, and two young daughters . According to NBC, the bunker was an elaborate prefabricated structure with vent pipes hidden by wood and other debris. Miller, considered armed and extremely dangerous, knows the tree-lined canyons of Humboldt County where he grew up well. Investigators found his pickup truck abandoned near Petrolia, about 200 miles west of the home that Miller shared with his family. He is described as an 'avid outdoorsman' and survivalist, who has the skills to fortify himself in an area so remote it's called the 'lost coast.' Just before 8pm on May 7, someone at the Miller home called 911. According to NBC, the dispatcher heard a woman sobbing and loud banging sounds. Deputies who went to the house on Alpine Way in Shingleton found the doors locked and Sandra Miller and her daughters shot to death inside. Missed: Sandra Miller is pictured here on Glass Beach in California with her dog a month before she was killed . Crime scene: Police were called to the home Miller shared with his family two weeks before he murdered his wife and children . Two weeks before the shootings, police had been called to the property for a domestic dispute. Shane Miller was missing. Sandra Miller told officers her husband was 'abusive' and deputies escorted her from the home. she drove towards her mother's house but Miller found her at a motel in Humboldt County and forced her to return to Shingleton. 'He also threatened to kill her and their daughters if she left him again,' reads the affidavit. 'On the morning of the murders, Sandra Miller told her mother that she planned on telling Miller later that day she was leaving him.' One day later, Miller's gold 2010 Dodge Mega Cab pickup was foound in a remote area near the town of Petrolia. One week later, his dog was found wandering along the Lost Coast Trail. In 2002, Miller was charged in San Francisco with making and selling marijuana for distribution, being a felon in possession of a firearm, possessing a machine gun and money laundering, according to court records. He pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a gun and was sentenced to three years and 10 months in prison. He was released in May 2007, according to the federal Bureau of Prisons. He served 46 months in federal prison for being a felon in possession of a firearm, court records show. 'It would be easy to hide out up there,' said local resident Phil Franklin, one of hundreds ordered to lock doors and shelter in place in the early days of the manhunt. Armed and dangerous: The sole suspect in the murder of his family, Miller is now on the Most Wanted list . Domestic tragedy: Shasta County Sheriff's deputies investigating the scene of the triple homicide in Shingleton . A sheriff's investigator said Miller's retreat into the mountainous woods creates a dangerous situation for officers trying to track him. 'It's almost like warfare,' said Lieutenant Dave Kent of the Shasta County Sheriff's Office, which is handling the investigation. To imagine the ruggedness of the landscape think 'Jurrasic Park' - some of the movie was filmed there. Many residents live off the grid on unmarked back roads often shrouded in a coastal fog. Authorities say Miller is familiar with the tree-lined canyons so steep that only one paved, pot-holed road serves the area. Like Franklin, most of the residents are armed because law enforcement patrols are rare in this community built on a peninsula that juts into the Pacific. 'The county is strapped for money so we don't have police protection out here. We all contact each other if something occurs so we can coordinate help,' Franklin said. Authorities believed at one point that Miller may have purchased property in Oregon under an assumed name and fled there after the killings. A separate court filing also speculates that Miller may have gone to Mexico. Now the search has returned to the area Miller is most familiar with. 'He better hope that the police get hold of him before a lot of the guys around here, because they would just as soon tar and feather him and string him up,' Vera De Witt, president of a local non-profit raising money for a memorial for the girls, told NBC News. Fugitive: Shane Miller has been on the loose for more than seven months and police believe he is hiding in remote forest in California . She said the killings had shocked the community, which is still reeling seven months on. Painful questions arose, she said, especially among local children. 'Particularly,' she said, 'little girls going home and asking, ""Daddy, would you kill me, would you shoot me?""' She has established memorial trees at the elementary school and preschool where Shelby Ann and Shasta Miller were educated. A third was planted outside the local library and excess money raised for the trees was donated. 'The trees will always be there, along with the books,' she told NBC. Since the killings and Miller's disappearance, police have received thousands of tip-offs from the public, but none has led to Miller. He remains at large and has been placed on the FBI's Most Wanted list with a $25,000 reward for information leading to his capture.","Shane Franklyn Miller, 45, is wanted for the murder of his wife and two daughters .

Officers have been moved from Moron, Spain, to Camp Lemonnier in Dijibouti, in preparation that the State Department will request the immediate evacuation of any U.S. citizens left in the area, which is estimated at about 100 people, according to Fox News. The move comes days after an unsuccessful attempt to evacuate 15 American civilians trapped in an eastern city in South Sudan. That mission was aborted when three aircraft sent to evacuate the Americans took heavy ground fire, injuring four aboard, officials said. Scroll down for video .

The number of internal refugees has likely surpassed 100,000, said Lanzer, who is seeking urgent financial assistance from the international community. The violence began late on Dec. 15. South Sudan President Salva Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, said last week that an attempted military coup had triggered the violence, and the blame was placed on former Vice President Riek Machar, an ethnic Nuer. Other officials have since said a fight between Dinka and Nuer members of the presidential guard triggered the fighting, which spiraled across the country. President Obama over the weekend sent a letter to congressional leaders letting them know he may take further military action in South Sudan to protect U.S. citizens, personnel and property. Fighting continued over the weekend, as the central government acknowledged it has lost control of Bentiu, the capital Unity, a key oil-producing state. United Nations Mission in Sudan guard people displaced by recent fighting in Jabel, on the outskirts of capital Juba, on December 23, 2013. Clashes between rival groups of soldiers in Juba have spread across the country, which won its independence from Sudan in 2011 after decades of war . Soldiers of the East Africa Response Force (EARF), a Djibouti-based joint team assigned to Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa, prepare to load onto a U.S. Air Force C-130 Hercules at Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti, to support with an ordered departure of personnel from Juba, South Sudan . East African leaders are leading diplomatic efforts to avoid a full-blown civil war. South Sudan experienced decades of war with Sudan, which it peacefully broke away from in 2011. One analyst suggested South Sudan's unrest is partly a problem of the Obama administration's own making. '[National Security Adviser] Susan Rice has invested an enormous amount of energy in helping South Sudan to separate from northern Sudan after 25 years of civil war and violence, so we helped install the current president, we've given them over 600 million dollars worth of aid and we've been the country to prop them up during this period of transition,' said Gen. Bob Scales, a Fox News military analyst. But Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes pushed back on the comment. 'We are proud of the instrumental role we played in supporting a peaceful referendum on independence in South Sudan, which implemented the comprehensive agreement that was reached in 2005. Support for self-determination in South Sudan has been broad and bipartisan for many years,' he told Fox News. The White House also issued a strongly worded statement to leaders of the warring factions over the weekend, after the president arrived in Hawaii for his holiday vacation. 'Any effort to seize power through the use of military force will result in the end of longstanding support from the United States and the international community,' the statement said.","About 150 Marines have been sent to the Horn of Africa from Spain .

A robot developed by a Japanese start-up that was recently acquired by Google has left 15 rivals for dead at a two-day competition hosted by the Pentagon to see which machine could cope best in the event of a nuclear meltdown. Team Schaft's machine carried out all eight rescue-themed tasks - including scaling a ladder, opening a door, removing debris and clearing debris - to outscore its rivals by a mechanical mile, taking 27 of a possible 32 points. However NASA's entry Valkyrie, a $3 million creation, failed to score a single point, in an embarrassing blow to the U.S. space station. The machine was seemingly designed to much in an astronaut sense, weighing a clunky 125kg, rather than being to help out in a crisis. Schaft' s closest competitor was IHMC Robotics - which used the Google/Boston Dynamics ATLAS robot - which cored 20 points, the BBC reports. Three of the other 15 teams that took part failed to secure any points at the event near Miami, Florida, with NASA one of them. 'Anything you can do, humans!': Japanese robot Schaft completes one of the eight DARPA challenges - climbing a steep ladder . Embarassing: The robot created by NASA (pictured) failed to complete any of the eight tasks it was assigned during the two-day DARPA competition . Clean-up: Another task required clearing debris from an entry way. DARPA said the motivated to do the competition are realizing how little robots were able to help during the 2011 Fukushima nuclear meltdown . Four countries took place in the competition - United States, Japan, Korea and China. Darpa said it had been inspired to organise the challenge after it became clear robots were only capable of playing a very limited role in efforts to contain 2011's Fukushima nuclear reactor meltdown in Japan. 'What we realised was ... these robots couldn't do anything other than observe,' said Gill Pratt, programme manager for the Darpa Robotics Challenge. 'What they needed was a robot to go into that reactor building and shut off the valves.' In order to spur on development of more adept robots the agency challenged contestants to complete a series of tasks, with a time-limit of 30 minutes for each. Among the challenges were driving a utility vehicle along a course, climb an 8ft-high ladder, remove debris blocking a doorwar and cut a triangular shape in a wall using a cordless drill. More than 100 teams originally applied to take part, and the number was whittled down to 17 by Darpa ahead of Friday and Saturday's event. Schaft is also capable of opening a door. The two-legged humanoid out-mastered rivals by seven points . Epic fail: In a demonstration video, NASA said they were 'thinking about the competition the entire time' while making Valkyrie, which cost $3 million. Maybe they should have been thinking about it actually working? Some entered their own machines, while others made use of Atlas - a robot manufactured by another Google-owned business, Boston Dynamics - controlling it with their own software. One self-funded team from China - Intelligent Pioneer - dropped out at the last moment, bringing the number of contestants who took part at the Homestead-Miami Speedway racetrack to 16. Schaft's 1.48m (4ft 11in) tall, two-legged robot entered the contest the favourite and lived up to its reputation. It makes use of a new high-voltage liquid-cooled motor technology that uses a capacitor, rather a battery, for power. Its engineers say this lets its arms move and pivot at higher speeds than would otherwise be possible, in effect giving it stronger ""muscles"". Virginia Tech's Thor-OP The robots had to attach a hose pipe as one of their challenges . The machine was developed by a spin-off from the University of Tokyo's Jouhou System Kougaku lab, which Google recently revealed it had acquired. In case of an emergency, Schaft unhooks a fire hose . Robot Atlas-Iam attempts the ladder challenge during the event in Florida . The team scored 27 points out of a possible 32, putting it seven points ahead of second-placed IHMC Robotics, which used Atlas. Scores were based on a system that awarded three points for completing a task's primary objectives, and then a bonus point for doing so without any human intervention. Schaft's robot behaved almost perfectly, but lost points because 'the wind blew a door out of their robot's hold and because their robotic creation was not able to climb out of a vehicle after it successfully navigated an obstacle course,' reported the Japan Daily Press. Four countries took part in the DARPA competition, including United States, Korea, China and of course Japan .","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) decided to host a competition that would test the world's greatest robotic technology .

Al Qaeda has apologised after doctors and patients were slaughtered at a hospital during an attack on a military compound - blaming a rogue gunman for the murders. Shocking CCTV footage emerged of an Al Qaeda fighter shooting unarmed hospital staff in the head during an attack on the Defence Ministry compound in Sanaa, Yemen, earlier this month. In one scene, the gunman can be seen cornering a group inside the compound's hospital building before throwing a grenade directly at them.

No escape: The gunman, who was wearing an army uniform, then throws a grenade into the crowd of hospital staff before running away . Huge blast: One woman runs after the gunman but the others are caught in the blast . Seconds later, sparks can be seen as the grenade explodes. More than 50 people were killed in the attack . The corridor is left shrouded in smoke after the grenade goes off - it is not clear how many people, if any, survived the blast . At least 52 people were killed in the attack which has sparked outrage among both across Yemen and in the international community. But Al Qaeda's commander of its Yemen wing, Qassim Ar-Reimy, has now condemned the killings and accused a renegade fighter of being responsible. In a pre-recorded video he said: 'We confess to this mistake and fault, we offer our apologies and condolence to the families of the victims'. Targeted: Hospital staff gather by the hospital entrance as an Al Qaeda fighter drives a car packed with explosives into the gate of the ministry's compound . Explosion: The Al Qaeda militants set off explosives to blow the gate and enter the compound . He goes on to claim that the focus of the attack had always been the Ministry and not the hospital. He said: 'We did not target them on purpose, this is not of our religion or our morals, we accept full responsibility for what happened in the hospital. 'The attack was on the Ministry of Defence, it was not on the Hospital. 'The ministry's hospitals are . abundant in the country.

The killing of unarmed medics and patients, captured on closed-circuit television footage and broadcast by state media, caused widespread outrage in Yemen, where al Qaeda has portrayed itself as fighting for normal people against foreign drone strikes. Al Qaeda's offshoot Ansar al-Sharia (Partisans of Islamic Law) claimed responsibility earlier this month for the December 5 assault - the worst attack in Yemen for 18 months. Two men are shown on CCTV standing in a doorway of the hospital moments before they are shot down . Brutal: The gunman can be seen standing over the bodies of the two men in the doorway . Casualties: At least 52 people were killed in the attack - many inside the hospital building - and many more were injured . Victims: Paramedics load a victim into an ambulance after an explosion at the Defence Ministry complex in Sanaa, Yemen . It said it attacked the compound because it believed it to house an operations room for drone attacks carried out by the United States against Islamist militants, which have also led to civilian deaths. Many of those killed died inside the compound's hospital, where staff said they had seen foreign doctors and nurses executed by attackers. The footage released on state television showed uniformed figures wandering around the hospital's corridors, shooting medics and patients. One attacker was shown walking up to a group of cowering patients and calmly tossing a hand grenade into their midst before ducking behind a wall.

Rachel Washburn has worn both camouflage and Vera Wang-designed two pieces in her two very different careers. Before the 25-year-old First Lieutenant joined the Army, she was a cheerleader for the Philadelphia Eagles. After two tours of duty in Afghanistan, the team decided to honor her as one of their 'Hometown Heros' in Sunday's game against the Chicago Bears. Scroll down for video . The two lives of Rachel Washburn: Before joining the Army after college, Lt Washburn was a cheerleader for the Philadelphia Eagles football team. They honored her as one of their hometown heroes at Sunday's game against the Bears . Pre-deployment: Lt Washburn (center) served as an Eagles cheerleader for four years while she attended Drexel University on an ROTC scholarship . 'Rachel really is the epitome of an . American hero,' Barbara Zaun, the Eagles director of cheerleading, told the team's website, adding that she looks forward to getting the opportunity to acknowledge her bravery and service.  'It will be very . special for me to see her honored as our Hometown Hero after working so . closely with her during her time as a cheerleader.' It comes as an immense honor for Lt Washburn, who moved twelve times growing up as a military brat, and didn't settle in Philadelphia until college when she accepted an ROTC scholarship to attend Drexel University. In addition to her army training at Drexel, Lt Washburn decided to continue her passion for gymnastics on the dance team. When one of her dance team mates made the Philadelphia Eagles team, she decided to try out as well and made the team on first try. American hero: Lt Washburn has served two tours of duty in Afghanistan on the Army's Cultural Support Team . Girl power: Lt Washburn's role in the Army has been to communicate with local women during Special Operations missions, looking out for their safety and that of their children . Wonder woman: On one mission, Lt Washburn delivered a baby during a snowstorm with the help of medics over the radio . During her four years in college, she watched tamer battles wage on Lincoln Financial Field but eventually traded her pom poms for an assault rifle after graduation. During her two deployments in Afghanistan, Lt Washburn served on the Army's Cultural Support Team. Lt Washburn explains that this group was created to help Special Operations troops who aren't allowed to engage with the local female population. Female soldiers are recruited to look out for the safety of the local women and children during these missions. Decorated: In her three years in the military Lt Washburn has received the Bronze Star Medal; the ARmy Commendation Medal; and the Combat, Airborne, and Air Assault badges . While it's certainly a lot different than memorizing cheers and choreography, Ms Washburn says her time with the Philadelphia Eagles translated in many ways to the battlefield. Off the field, Ms Washburn acted as a representative of the Eagles team on visits to hospitals, and even a USO trip to Iraq to cheer up soldiers. 'We're all beautiful women who are there to be entertaining at games, but also, we are incredibly involved in the community, which is something that I am incredibly proud of, and I'm sure that all of the other girls feel the same way. I'm really proud of the Eagles organization putting us out there in that sort of capacity.' Once a cheerleader, always a cheerleader: She hasn't forgotten her days on the Eagles team and says that whenever she goes to her happy place, she thinks of her first game . One of the ways she helped Afghani women was by delivering a baby during a snowstorm, getting instructions from medics over radio. In her three years in the military, Ms Washburn has already earned the Bronze Star Medal; Army Commendation Medal; and the Combat, Airborne and Air Assault badges. But she says she's never forgotten her time on the football field. During mental toughness training in the military, Lt Washburn was told to think of a happy moment in order to keep calm during a stressful situation. 'My happy place just so happened to be what I remember my first game being like. We lined up in the end zones for the pre-game dance, and I just remember it being a beautiful August day, so that memory has always stuck with me,' she said. Lt Washburn is currently stationed at Fort Stewart in Georgia as a platoon leader.","First Lieutenant Rachel Washburn was a Philadelphia Eagles cheerleader from 2007-2010 .

A man narrowly escaped death after he was shot in the head with a crossbow while he was lying unconscious following an outbreak of mob violence. Rolanda Gedminas would have died if the eight-inch bolt had been just a few millimetres deeper or higher, a court head. Rod Woolliss was jailed for 10 years yesterday after admitting the attempted murder of the 27-year-old during a mass brawl in a park in Grimsby. Attack: An X-ray of Rolanda Gedminas' head with a crossbow bolt embedded in a salivary gland . Danger: He could have died if the bolt had been embedded just a few millimetres deeper or higher . The victim was taken to hospital with the crossbow bolt sticking out of his head, and had it removed by surgeons. Richard Woolfall, prosecuting, told Hull Crown Court that Mr Gedminas, a leaflet distributor from Lithuania, was involved in a fight between immigrants and Grimsby locals on July 7. Around 40 people were believed to have been present, with some people on both sides carrying weapons. Mr Gedminas and a woman were assaulted and knocked to the ground, and he then had his head kicked and stamped on. Weapon: The crossbow used to attack Mr Gedminas during a mass brawl in Grimsby . Jailed: Rod Woolliss admitted attempted murder and received a 10-year prison sentence . Woolliss, 22, who was one of the attackers, fired the crossbow at close range, causing a 'thud' noise. 'Woolliss took a crossbow and shot him . to the side of the head,' Mr Woolfall said. 'He was extremely lucky to . have survived that.' When Mr Gedminas was taken to hospital, doctors found that the bolt had embedded itself in a salivary gland. If it had been embedded 1mm either way, the bolt would probably have severed the victim's carotid artery or brain stem, causing almost certain death, the court heard. And if it had been any deeper, it would have 'bisected his spinal cord', according to Mr Woolfall. As he left the park, Woolliss was apparently boasting about his crime, telling friends he had shot a 'dirty foreigner'. Richard Butters, mitigating, said: 'The complainant group were tooled up. They had metal bars of three to three-and-a-half-foot length. 'The foreign group provoked the situation and it could be said that they, in fact, started it.' Accomplices: Adrian Francis, left, and Ashley Meadows, right, were also jailed for their parts in the fight . Three other thugs were also sentenced for their part in the fight. Adrian Francis, 24, was jailed for six years and two months after admitting violent disorder and attempted grievous bodily harm. Ashley Meadows, 26, pleaded guilty to violent disorder and was given a three-and-a-half-year sentence. A 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, received an eight-month detention order for violent disorder.","Rolanda Gedminas, 27, was attacked during a fight in a Grimsby park .

When she failed to recover he took her to a hospital, and was once again told that she should recover by herself - but less than two days later, the girl suddenly died.

Mr Aashtar now says that doctors 'let us down' by failing to spot that his daughter's condition was much more serious than initially believed. The 43-year-old father from Redbridge, Essex took Fizzah to the Ilford Medical Centre when she was suffering from a rash and a pain in the side. A doctor apparently told him she had a viral infection, saying that ordinary painkillers would be enough to help her recover. Mr Aashtar and his wife Rubina became concerned when her condition did not improve, and took her to an emergency drop-in centre at King George Hospital in Ilford. Another doctor diagnosed Fizzah with a virus, and said that she would recover within three days. Sent away: Doctors at King George Hospital in Ilford, Essex said the five-year-old would recover in three days . But the next day she began throwing up, and the morning after she was lying in her father's arms when her eyes suddenly rolled back in her head. 'I lost her in my arms,' Mr Aashtar told the Ilford Recorder. 'I was doing mouth-to-mouth as I was talked through it on the phone. But I knew she was gone.' The driving instructor, who also has two teenage sons, is now considering legal action over the medical treatment given to his daughter. 'I can't believe they just sent us home from hospital,' he told the Evening Standard. 'They said everything would be fine and we believed them. They let us down.' The GPs' partnership which runs the hospital centre where Fizzah was treated says it is currently examining the circumstances of her death. Ilford Medical Centre has declined to comment on the case. Walthamstow coroner's court told the Standard that the coroner was passed details of the girl's death, but has decided not to hold an inquest.","Marshal Aashtar took daughter Fizzah Malik to the GP with a rash and pain .

A natural cave discovered near the source of the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami contains the footprints of past gigantic waves dating up to 7,500 years ago. Experts say that the Indonesian cave, which is close to where the earthquake hit, could help them predict when the next tsunami is likely to occur. And according to the research, the next disaster could be centuries, if not decades away. The findings provide the longest and most detailed timeline for tsunamis that have taken place off the far western tip of Sumatra island in Aceh province. A guide stands inside a cave which scientists said reveals history of ancient tsunamis . The province is where 100 foot waves triggered by a magnitude 9.1 earthquake on December 26, 2004, killing 230,000 people in several countries. The limestone cave, located within a couple hundred yards of the coast near Banda Aceh, is about three feet above knee-high tide and protected from storms and wind. Only huge waves that inundate the coastal area are able to gush inside. In 2011 researchers uncovered seabed sand deposits that were swept into the cave over thousands of years and neatly layered between bat droppings like a geological cake. The cave was discovered near the source of 2004's massive earthquake-spawned tsunami . The Indonesian cave contains the footprints of past gigantic waves dating up to 7,500 years ago . Radiocarbon analysis of materials, including clamshells and the remains of microscopic organisms, provided evidence of 11 tsunamis before 2004. The disasters were by no means evenly spaced, said lead researcher Charles Rubin from the Earth Observatory of Singapore. The last one occurred about 2,800 years ago, but there were four others in the 500 years before that. And it is possible there were others. Researchers know, for instance, that there were two mammoth earthquakes in the region around 1393 and 1450. The cave provides a rare natural record suggesting future generations living in the coastal area must stay prepared because disasters can occur in relatively short bursts or after long lulls . Mr Rubin said a big tsunami could have carried away evidence of other events through erosion. The scientists are still working to determine the size of the waves that entered the cave. Mr Rubin said: 'The take-home message is perhaps that the 2004 event doesn't mean it won't happen for another 500 years. 'We did see them clustered together closer in time. I wouldn't put out a warning that we're going to have an earthquake, but it shows that the timing is really variable.' The quake that triggered the 2004 tsunami surprised scientists because the fault that unleashed the megathrust temblor had been quiet for hundreds of years. And since the last big earthquake had struck more than 500 years earlier, there was no surviving oral history that could have helped people understand the risk. Since 2004, much research has been done to try to learn about the area's past by examining sand deposits, uplifted coral and GPS data. Katrin Monecke, a geosciences professor at Wellesley College in Massachusetts has been following the research. She said: 'The findings are very significant. 'The sand sheets in the cave cover a very long time span and give an excellent idea about earthquake frequency.'","Natural discovery provides record of past tsunamis dating 7,500 years .

Two members of the jailed Russian protest punk band Pussy Riot have vowed to set up a human rights organisation. Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alekhina were granted amnesty on Monday, two months short of their scheduled release. The move has been seen as the Kremlin's attempt to soothe criticism of Russia's human rights record ahead of the February Winter Olympics in Sochi. Pussy Riot members Nadezhda Tolokonnikova (right) and Maria Alyokhina (left) hold hands as they walk outside Yemelyanovo airport in Krasnoyarsk . Alekhina flew into the eastern Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk early Tuesday to be reunited with Tolokonnikova. They have said the amnesty and their release was a publicity stunt by the Kremlin ahead of the Olympics. Tolokonnikova has also called for a boycott of the Olympics. Alekhina, still dressed in a dark green prison jacket, hugged Tolokonnikova and then shook hands. The pair have announced plans to set up a human rights organisation, after being sentenced to two years in prison for their cathedral protest . Both women reiterated that they would like to focus their future work on helping prisoners, and that they will discuss setting up a human rights organisation. The band's third member, Yekaterina Samutsevich, was released on suspended sentence shortly after the three were found guilty of hooliganism and sentenced to two years in prison in 2012 for their protest at Christ the Savior Cathedral in Moscow. On trial: The pair sitting in a glass-walled cage in a court in Moscow during their 2012 trial. They have been released two months early in what is seen as a pre-Winter Olympics publicity stunt . The women have denied the accusations that they were driven by hatred of religion, and said their performance was aimed at raising concern about the close ties between the church and state. Russian parliament passed the amnesty bill last week, allowing the release of thousands of inmates, including the two Pussy Riot members.","Release seen as publicity stunt ahead of Winter Olympics .

Speaking out: Kimberley Wilson has revealed that she was subjected to abuse from viewers of The Great British Bake Off . A finalist in The Great British Bake Off says she was told to 'know her place' by viewers who abused her online while the hit BBC2 series was on air. Kimberley Wilson blames the simplistic way producers portrayed her for the harsh reception - and suggests that women were more vitriolic than men towards the female contestants. The 30-year-old psychologist is not the first of this year's finalists to complain about her treatment by viewers - Ruby Tandoh said she received an 'extraordinary amount of bitterness and bile' on social media during the show, whose fourth series concluded in October. Miss Wilson and Miss Tandoh reached the final of the baking contest, judged by Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry, but were beaten by eventual winner Frances Quinn. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's World at One, Miss Wilson revealed that she was sent dozens of message accusing her of being arrogant and responding badly to criticism. She said that viewers told her: 'I was too self-satisfied, I was too confident and cocky and cocksure and I wasn't showing enough vulnerability, I wasn't showing enough deference, I wasn't being gracious enough. 'I read comments which said I should know my place. That was really quite an interesting response to what I went into thinking was just a baking show. It felt political.' Despite suggestions of a misogynistic bias against the three women who made it to this year's final, Miss Wilson said that many of the most virulent abuse came from female viewers. Contestants: Miss Wilson, left, reached the final of this year's show along with Ruby Tandoh, centre, and eventual winner Frances Quinn, right . Popular: The BBC hit has made national stars of its two judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry . 'I would say the harshest critics of the guys on the Bake Off would be women sat on their sofas talking to each other saying ""She looks a bit fat in that"" or ""I don't think she's done a very good job of her jam tarts."" I think it's women who are actually the harshest critics. 'There's a danger when you talk about a gender bias, you imagine it's men attacking women, whereas I think actually women can be the real damage to a kind of perceived sisterhood that never existed.' She added: 'What you got was a kind of condensed, slightly two-dimensional representation of what happened. Nothing was fictionalised, but it wasn't fully nuanced. 'I was presented as kind of uber-confident and uber-competent, which is probably just not human. That becomes a bit of a problem in terms of viewers watching it because it becomes a little bit unnatural and there was a little bit of repercussion for me in terms of that.' 'Misogyny': Miss Tandoh, known for her emotional persona, has previously described the abuse she received from online viewers . Miss Wilson said that some viewers may have seen her as particularly confident thanks to her training as a psychologist - but she insisted that her career in fact made her more vulnerable. 'One of the producers did say, ""You don't seem to be too riled by some of the things the judges say, you don't seem to get very upset about things. Is it something about your job which means you have a thick skin?'' 'Actually, I think it's completely the opposite. I'm a psychologist, part of my job is about taking criticism every single day. I sit in supervision and my work is taken apart line by line verbatim in sessions. I've sat in therapy and I've looked at myself and I understand myself. 'It's about not just pushing criticism away in a kind of defensive stance. It's about partly understanding what's being picked up on and, painfully, is there any truth in it, is there any reality in it and if so can you deal with that?' In a blistering article written just after the end of the show, Miss Tandoh - known for her emotional persona on the show - hit out at the 'personal vitriol and misogyny' which she said she had received from some viewers. 'Despite the saccharine sweetness of the Bake Off, an extraordinary amount of bitterness and bile has spewed forth every week from angry commentators, both on social media and in the press,' she wrote.","Kimberley Wilson, 30, says producers portrayed her as more self-confident than she actually was .

This is all that remains of a high-performance car after it crashed into a lorry and erupted into a fireball, killing the three men inside. Such was the intensity of the blaze that the car was reduced to this lump of molten metal. Police are investigating whether the car was racing a Vauxhall Astra, when the crash happened in the early hours of yesterday on London’s North Circular near Arnos Grove. Extinguish: A fireman works to put out the burning wreckage of the car . The two men in the Astra were later arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. Eyewitnesses told how they tried to reach the men in the Subaru Impreza as it was consumed by flames, but were beaten back by the intense heat. Last night there were suggestions the Impreza may have been fitted with a nitrous oxide kit to make it go faster, a modification used by some of the cars in the Fast And Furious film series. Paul Walker, star of the films, was killed in a high-speed car crash in Los Angeles last month. Two of the dead men were understood to be in their early twenties, while the third man is said to be in his early thirties. The three victims are thought to have all been men. A second car, a Vauxhall Astra, was also involved in the crash and two men have been taken to hospital with minor injuries. One was discharged and then arrested. The second was also arrested but remains in hospital. The lorry driver also received minor injuries . Smash: This horrifying picture shows the 'fireball' crash which killed three in the early hours of this morning . Tragedy: The remains of the car, left, and the lorry, right, could still be seen on the road until around 8am . According to some reports, the car may have been fitted with a nitrous oxide kit to make it go faster - in the style of the cars in The Fast and The Furious. Police said this afternoon they are having difficulty formally identifying the three people killed due to the nature of their injuries. They believe they know the identities of the deceased but cannot issue details until they have confirmation. Only then after next of kin have been told will they release the names and ages of the three. Claims: One witness has suggested the car could have been fitted with N20 gas - which makes the vehicle go much faster than it is usually capable of . Wreckage: Fire service members, pictured around the remains of the car, work to clear the road . Death: Police are struggling to identify the victims of the crash as their bodies are so badly burnt . Neos Sofianou, 72, who lives opposite the scene, said the road has been long-plagued by boy-racers speeding down the road at speeds of 100mph. Describing the crash Mr Sofianou said: 'I had been in bed and when I heard a really loud band and thought it must be the cars crashing. 'I ran to see what was happening and when I saw the car was on fire I tried to help with fire extinguishers. 'But we couldn’t get close enough to the car because of the flames and it was just so hot. It really was a terrible sight because we knew they were in the car and knew they were burning. Emergency: Fire crews, ambulance and police at the scene of the collision in north London . 'Two cars were racing. One hit the other, which hit the curb of the central reservation and it went over to the other side of the road. 'A lorry was coming in the opposite direction and it hit the car head to head before it went up in flames. We had to wait for the emergency services to arrive because we just couldn’t do anything. 'The impact of the head-on collision with the lorry caused the car to be crushed to a quarter of its size, and then it was surrounded in hot, orange flames. I have never seen anything like it before. 'It made me jump when I heard the impact, but I knew it would have been the cars we heard racing. 'It was not a pretty sight and is such a waste of life. I feel bad for the families, especially this close to Christmas. It’s lucky that no one was standing at the bus stop.' He added: 'We have this problem every night with boy-racers. My son called the police even before the impact - he heard the screeching of the brakes and the engines revving and the cars racing. Scene: The passengers of the Subaru Impreza were killed when they smashed into a reservation on the North Circular, pictured, before colliding with the lorry . 'I have complained many times about this racing and have suggested a speed limit or cameras but nobody listens. 'Every night they are here doing 80, 90, 100 miles and hour. It was only a matter of time before something like this happened. 'The road was supposed to be improved to accommodate more cars, but this has just caused more problems. Mr Sofianou’s son Marios, 47, who was visiting his parents from Cyprus, said: 'There were at least two cars that were racing, three guys in one and I think one guy in the other car. Crash: Two people have been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving following the crash, scene pictured . 'Then the car on the outer lane hit the middle, flew over the barrier and hit a lorry. One car came up here unharmed. 'We had to watch the three of them burn, it was horrible.' A local businessman has written to transport bosses warning them of speeding drivers on the stretch of road where three men were killed in a crash last night. Harry Frang, who runs the Take @ Break cafe opposite the bus stop that the lorry crashed into, said he had written to Boris Johnson and TfL warning them of the perils of the road. He said: 'I have sent letters from solicitors to Boris Johnson and TfL telling them about this racing and asking them to do something, but nobody listens and they think I'm mad. 'All the time there are boys in their cars and on motorbikes speeding past here, sometime more than 100 miles an hour. 'Fireball': The driver of the lorry, pictured being removed from the scene this morning, suffered minor injuries . 'I told Boris Johnson and TfL it was a death trap. There have been other crashes here before but nothing this serious or horrible - maybe now somebody will listen to me.' Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a chemical compound used as an oxidizing agent in engines.

It . is perfectly legal to drive cars with nitrous fitted - but many . conventional insurers will not cover cars that have the modification. Nitrous-fitted cars feature heavily in The Fast and The Furious films. They are often in car-racing video games such as Need For Speed also. Mr Frang added: 'They have moved the bollards that were outside and if the bus stop hadn't been there the cars and lorry would have come straight into my shop. 'It's just not safe enough and they drive so fast. All they need is a speed camera to slow people down. The changes to the roads have only made it worse between the two sets of traffic lights.'

Britain is accused of breaching almost 50 EU rules over items ranging from tractors to toys – and even garlic.

If ministers fail to address the allegations, lawsuits could end up in crippling fines at the European Court of Justice. Britain is accused of breaching almost 50 EU rules over items ranging from tractors to toys ¿ and even garlic . One claim, concerning import duties on fresh garlic from China, was sent to the court in September. Eurocrats also want to take action over the delayed implementation of a directive about emissions from narrow track tractors, introduced by the Commission in February. Other complaints, about which few details have been disclosed, concern toy safety, the cleanliness of beaches, the energy performance of buildings and vehicles nearing their ‘end of life’. Details of the 47 legal actions, obtained under freedom of information laws from the Cabinet Office, will fuel the fierce debate about Britain’s role in Europe.

We simply can’t carry on like this.’ A legal expert who advises ministers about infringement told the Daily Telegraph that such cases can drag on for years and involve half a dozen government lawyers. Often the Commission has simply misunderstood the situation, he added.

More than two million people have apparently been to see Pope Francis speak in St Peter's Square since he was elected in March. That is four times as many as Benedict attracted to the Vatican last year - suggesting that Francis' warm demeanour and open-minded pronouncements has boosted public support for the Catholic Church. The Vatican announced yesterday that 1,548,500 tickets have been issued so far for Francis' general audiences in St Peter's Square. Popular: Pope Francis has drawn more than 2million people to St Peter's Square this year, according to the Vatican . The total number attending was 'much larger', according to officials, because overflow areas nearby, which do not require tickets, are regularly filled with around 20,000 people. The events, which usually take place on Wednesdays, have been held 30 times since the Pope was elected on March 13. By comparison, 447,000 tickets were issued for general audiences with Benedict XVI during the whole of 2012. Francis was last week named Person of the Year by Time magazine, having impressed many with his outgoing and friendly style. Crowds: Even overflow areas have often been full of Catholics wanting to see the new Pope . He has forsaken many of the trappings used by his predecessors, choosing to live in a small flat in a guest house and using a regular car instead of the papal limousine. Francis drawn popularity because of his statements urging the Church to be closer to the poor and to be more merciful and less condemning. The crowds at Francis' general audiences have often topped 100,000, forcing police to close off the main boulevard leading to the Vatican to accommodate more people. Contrast: Benedict XVI drew only a quarter of the number of people during his audiences last year . The Vatican newspaper said Francis telephoned Benedict to exchange Christmas greetings. Benedict is living in a former convent on the Vatican grounds and has the title Pope Emeritus. Tickets to audiences and all other papal events are issued for free by the Vatican's Prefecture of the Pontifical Household and usually distributed through parishes and Church institutions .","1.55million tickets have been issued for the weekly general audience .

According to a new survey, the all-in-one is the present that the majority of us would least like to find under the tree come Wednesday. Over a third said they wouldn't be happy to unwrap one - even a luxury version such as Marks & Spencer's Â£199 cashmere offering. Don't do it! Unlike the members of One Direction, most of us won't be pleased to find a onesie under the tree . No thanks! Even M&S's Â£199 cashmere onesie could prove unpopular if added to the present pile . But onesies weren't the only ones to appear at the top of the Christmas gift blacklist. Close behind all-in-ones were celebrity weight loss DVDs, which 32 per cent said they wouldn't want to find under the tree. In third place were novelty Christmas jumpers, hand-knitted or otherwise, which were chosen by 12 per cent of those asked. Also unpopular were socks of any kind and celebrity cook books. But for those hoping to avoid onesies and celebrity workout DVDs are likely to be disappointed: two thirds of us receive at least one gift we don't want every Christmas, according to the research by British Heart Foundation shops. Grandparents are the worst gift givers, with 12 per cent handing over stuff which is not wanted. They are followed by mothers, also with 12 per cent of the vote, and spouses who were nominated by seven per cent of those quizzed by the charity. Bad idea: Celebrity fitness DVDs and cook books also proved to be unpopular choices . But some good can come out of recieving a dodgy Christmas gift, with the British Heart Foundation urging people to donate unwanted presents to their shops to help fund life-saving research. Commenting on the survey, British Heart Foundation retail director Mike Taylor said: 'People often receive perfectly good gifts that are just not to their taste or are the wrong size. Or they even get two of the same thing.

The 50-year-old oil magnate was freed two days ago from his 'politically-motivated' sentence by the Russian authorities, who many claim are trying to improve their image before February's Winter Olympics. Today the long-standing rival to President Putin gave an emotional press conference in which he vowed to keep campaigning for political prisoners - but admitted he will no longer be involved in the 'struggle for power'. He urged the world not to boycott the Games in Sochi, saying it was a time for sport not politics. Yet he also insisted the global event should not be turned into 'a great party for President Putin'. Giving his first TV interview to CNN, Khodorkovsky shed light on his terrifying time in jail. He said: 'When I was stabbed with a knife I was lucky - he tried to get to my eye but he got my nose. 'As a result, the dentist who was there - someone who was also a plastic surgeon - carried out an operation on me, which means it was virtually not noticeable.' Asked whether he forgave Putin, he replied: 'I would put it differently, perhaps. I . don't think that revenge would be any rational behavior. And something . that is rational behaviour I can always deal with.' The former chairman of the Yukos Oil Company was jailed for tax evasion, fraud and embezzlement in 2003 - charges he denied - and was supposed to be released next August, but was freed early two days ago. Officials insist he was freed on humanitarian grounds because his mother Marina, 79, is ill. During today's press conference, held somewhat appropriately in Germany's Berlin Wall museum, he thanked media pressure and German officials for . helping secure the release from his 'political' sentence. He added he would not be returning to the . world of business since his financial situation 'did not require it.'

Yesterday he was reunited with his family, including his mother Marina, after his parents travelled from Moscow for the reunion. Suspicions are growing that the oil tycoon had struck a deal with his political foe Vladimir Putin which will prevent him becoming politically active against the Russian President. Supporters fear he agreed to the pardon after being threatened with new legal action to keep him in jail for another five years. Russia's Federal Penitentiary Service . said in a statement that Khodorkovsky had petitioned to be allowed to . travel to Germany to meet his mother, who is reportedly being treated for . cancer.

Mr Putin's announcement of his release, less than 24 . hours before it happened, appeared to catch both . the public and Khodorkovsky's lawyers by surprise. The release itself was also shrouded in mystery. Several hours before, . Khodorkovsky's lawyers and family said they still had no idea when he . would be let out of the prison colony, Segezha in the Karelia region of northwestern Russia.

In a shock remark after his annual . marathon news conference yesterday, Putin had said that Russia's most . famous prisoner had asked for clemency on humanitarian grounds as his . mother was ill. The Kremlin followed with a swift announcement today that Putin had already signed the pardon decree. 'Guided . by humanitarian principles, I decree that Mikhail Borisovich . Khodorkovsky... should be pardoned and freed from any further punishment . in the form of imprisonment,' said the decree signed by Putin and published by the Kremlin. Khodorkovsky and his business partner Platon Lebedev were convicted of fraud and tax evasion in 2005.

Bronfman Sr., who lobbied the Soviets to allow Jews to emigrate and helped spearhead the search for hidden Nazi loot, has died aged 84. The Canadian-born Bronfman died yesterday at his New York home surrounded by family, according to the family charity he led, The Samuel Bronfman Foundation. The World Jewish Congress president made his fortune with his family's Seagram's liquor empire, taking over as chairman and CEO in 1971 and continuing the work of his father, Samuel. Edgar M. Bronfman: The World Jewish Congress president, pictured here in 2005, died at his home yesterday aged 84 . Under Bronfman's leadership, Seagram expanded its offerings and was eventually acquired by French media and telecom group Vivendi Universal in 2000. But Bronfman's wealth, combined with his role in the World Jewish Congress, an umbrella group of Jewish organizations in some 80 countries that he led for more than a quarter century, allowed him to be a tireless advocate for his fellow Jews. 'He was the first of his kind, a titan of industry that dedicated himself fully to advocating, advancing and encouraging the Jewish people,' said Dana Raucher, executive director of The Samuel Bronfman Foundation. In 1999, President Bill Clinton awarded Bronfman the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. In the citation, Bronfman was heralded for working 'to ensure basic rights for Jews around the world.' Award-winning: President Clinton, right, awards the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, to Edgar M. Bronfman in 1999 . In a 1986 Associated Press profile, he said his position and money helped him have access to world leaders. 'It's a combination of the two,' Bronfman said. 'In the end, it doesn't really matter why that access is available, as long as it is there.' The year before, he had become the first congress president to meet with Soviet officials in Moscow, bringing his case for human rights and taking a little time to promote Seagram's interests. He visited again in 1988, by which time Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union, a key goal of the congress, had begun to rise under the reforming leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev. During the 1980s and 1990s, the congress also helped lead the effort to gain $11 billion in restitution for heirs of Holocaust victims. Jews in German and Nazi-held countries were stripped of their possessions, their artworks and even the gold fillings from their teeth in the regime's death camps. Much of the gold wound up in Swiss banks, and the institutions came under heavy criticism decades after the war ended for failing to make adequate reparations. In 1975, the Bronfman family made the news for a far different reason when one of Edgar Bronfman's sons, 21-year-old Samuel 2nd, was abducted in a New York suburb. FILE - Brofman, left, with German chancellor Angela Merkel in 2004 at an antisemitism conference in Berlin. Merkel was chair of the Christian Democratic party at the time . The family paid a $2.3 million ransom and Samuel was later found when authorities raided a Brooklyn apartment. The missing money was found under a bed and two men were arrested. The two were convicted of extortion, but acquitted of kidnapping, in a sensational 1976 trial in which the defense accused Samuel Bronfman of staging his own kidnapping as a hoax intended to cheat his father out of the ransom money. Samuel Bronfman denied the allegation and the prosecution called it 'ridiculous'. The family business had been built in Canada by Bronfman's colorful father, who entered the liquor business in 1915. His company, Distillers Corp., bought out rival Joseph E. Seagram & Sons in 1928. During that same time period, when Prohibition was the law in the U.S., much of their product sold legally in Canada later found its way into the bootleg U.S. market. During Samuel Bronfman's tenure, New York's Seagram Building became an important architectural landmark. Write caption here . Meanwhile, Edgar Bronfman was running the distilling company's U.S. operations, and his younger brother, Charles, was president of the Canadian branch. Samuel Bronfman was one of the world's richest men by the time he died in 1971, holding investments in real estate, oil and other concerns and donating millions to Jewish causes. Later, Edgar Bronfman's son Edgar Jr. had helped steer Seagram into the entertainment business in the 1990s. Seagram took over MCA Inc., with its big movie, music and theme park businesses, in 1995, and Edgar Jr. became an executive with Vivendi after the 2000 deal. Vivendi's expansion efforts later ran into financial trouble, and former top executives, including the younger Bronfman, were accused of misleading investors about the company's health. In 2009, a French judge ordered former Vivendi CEO Jean-Marie Messier and others to stand trial, including Bronfman Jr. Bronfman had left the WJC president's post amid a series of controversies. He had fired his longtime deputy, Rabbi Israel Singer, after a 2006 report by the New York attorney general concluded that Singer improperly used WJC funds for personal use. No criminal charges were filed.","Longtime president of the World Jewish Congress died in his New York home yesterday .

I don't keep him away from our kids.' She then sent Charlie two tweets disputing his claims and asking him to stop. In the first tweet she told him he was welcome to spend the holidays with her and the girls: '@charliesheen U done ranting? keep it classy dude.Our kids don't need to be privy to this,U are welcome 2 spend xmas w/us Hope u still come.'

Companions: But Little Joshua Carnegie had to be told his 'best friend' Tic Toc the pony is missing . A mother had to break the news to her five-year-old son that his pony has been stolen after crooks failed to return it in time for Christmas. Tic Toc, an adorable white Welsh Shetland cross, disappeared from his field on December 6. The 24-year-old has little value, suffers from the ageing condition Cushings disease, and needs daily medication for dietary problems. He belongs to Catriona Carnegie whose son Joshua has grown up with him and rides him every week in the summer. Catriona, 30, and husband Andrew, 36, a business manager, could not bring themselves to tell little Joshua that his beloved Tic Toc was missing. Friends and locals offered a £6,000 reward if Tic Toc is returned to his field in Ramsey St Mary, Cambridgeshire, before Christmas. But the thieves have failed to do the honest thing - leaving the parents no choice but to break the news to Joshua. Catriona, who keeps 20 horses, said: 'Josh is absolutely devastated. 'He has grown up with Tic Toc, they are best friend. Last year he wrote a letter to Father Christmas asking him to make Tic Toc better because he knows he's on medication for his feet. 'He talks about Tic Toc all the time, he's been asking why he hasn't seen him, when he can visit him and when he can ride him. 'I didn't want to tell Josh that Tic Toc has been stolen but I've had to tell him that he's not living with us anymore. 'I said he's gone to retirement home because his feet are bad and hopefully he might come back to us. He is absolutely devastated, he's heartbroken. All we want is to have Tic Toc back for Christmas.' Tic Toc is 11 hands tall with a thick curly coat especially on his legs and a pink muzzle with black speckles. He is unshod and unfreeze-marked. When he was taken he was wearing a blue Rambo rug with purple trim.

On the eve of the Downton Abbey Christmas special, this gloriously detailed floorplan is based on Highclere Castle (the real-life model for Downton) and the fictional house as it appears on TV. For the first time it allows fans to visualise exactly where the  household’s many love affairs, feuds  and dramas are played out... Scroll down for video . This is the 3D floorplan of Downton Abbey as it will appear in tomorrow's Christmas special episode - complete with a tree and Matthew's gramophone . Overlooked by balustrades on the first floor, this has Ming vases, Chinese lacquer cabinets, a huge fireplace, and enough floor space to hold a ball. A room this size reflected the splendour of the family’s lifestyle: at Highclere before World War I, this required a domestic staff that included 25 maids, 14 footmen and three chefs. Sometimes serves as the Earl of Grantham’s private den. In these two rooms at Highclere, there are 5,600 books dating back to Tudor times. With its red flock wallpaper, full-length oval mirror and four-poster bed, this room is a fine setting for melodrama. And it has seen plenty of it, especially the sudden death of Lady Mary’s Turkish lover, the diplomat Kemal Pamuk. But in real life the bedroom would also be the scene of the most mundane tasks: a maid would tiptoe in at dawn to light the fire and, if necessary, remove the chamber pot. This was menial work, but there was no shame in it. In 1912, the year in which Downton’s first series was set, 1.3 million people worked in domestic service, compared to 1.2 million on the land and 970,000 in the mines. This scene shot shows butler Carson with Lady Cora in Downton Abbey's drawing room, which the family retire into after meals to sip brandy . Where the Earl of Grantham and his family open their presents on Christmas Day, and where they help themselves  to a luncheon buffet laid out under  the glass-fronted book cabinets. The tradition at Downton is that the  staff have their Christmas dinner at lunchtime in the servants’ hall, and the family are served with theirs in the dining room in the evening. Scene of confidential fireside chats, it is the room to which all the family retire after meals to sip brandy or continue conversations from the dining table. Servants could not go to  bed until the family retired, often around midnight. The room was usually left in disarray — a maid’s first job at 5am, before she could have breakfast, was to clear the glasses, tidy the cushions and rake out the fire. Grandly furnished with polished walnut tables and lacquered cabinets displaying porcelain. Maids took care to clean only when family rooms were vacant and any breakages were deducted from wages. In . an age before vacuum cleaners, one popular method for lifting dust from . carpets was to sprinkle tea leaves over the floor and sweep them up. The Dowager Countess’s favourite sitting room. It . has high windows that let in cascades of light — one of  the . distinctive features of the real stately home, Highclere Castle, which . doubles as Downton Abbey. Where the butler met  guests, though never  guests of the servants — that  was forbidden. By 1920, cars  were a common sight on the drive. The open-top is a Crossley RFC, as owned by King George V and the  Prince of Wales. They cost £495 (£50,000 in today’s money). The only room in the main house where the smell of food was welcomed. Elsewhere, the family would have been scandalised to catch a whiff of cooking odours. That is why kitchens were located in the basement of great houses. The dining room would have been the only room in the main house where the smell of food was welcomed - that is why the kitchen is located in the basement . Scene of perhaps the most heartwrenching episode when Lord Grantham’s youngest daughter dies following the birth of her baby. In the early part of the 20th century about 5 per cent of births resulted in the mother’s death. That was equally true for the aristocracy and the working-class, and the death rate did not start to fall until antibiotics arrived in the Fifties. Where the middle Crawley daughter prepares for her wedding to Sir Anthony Strallan, only to be jilted. Finding a husband was tough after the carnage of World War I: two million women would stay spinsters. These were always busy. It was not unusual for stately homes such as Downton to have 30 guests at a time. This particular room was where the body of the diplomat Kemal Pamuk was taken after he had died in Lady Mary’s arms in her bedroom. Adjoining the marital bedroom. In the centre of this sunny room, there is a freestanding white bath — with no plumbing or taps. Buckets of hot water would be brought from the kitchens. A countess such as Cora would not bathe alone: her lady’s maid would be in attendance. This photograph shows Lady Cora in her bathroom, adjoining the marital bedroom, with a free-standing bath - which has no plumbing or taps . The bedroom of Thomas the thieving footman, at the end of the servants’ corridor, is typical of a servant’s sleeping quarters. With its single window and iron bed, it is almost as bare as a prison cell and would have been ice-cold in winter. There is an armchair, a bedside table with a lamp, a washstand and a faded woollen rug on the worn floorboards. While the family is at dinner, the maids will lay out the nightclothes. A copper pan would be filled with hot coals and, with its lid shut, slid between the sheets to make sure they are warm and dry. Sometimes doubles as his bedroom, for instance when his wife was ill. The Earl’s valet Mr Bates helps him dress here and would even cut his hair. A valet had to do everything. Has the human touches that the austere pantry lacks.

A federal judge on Monday allowed gay marriage to continue in Utah, rejecting a request to put same-sex weddings on hold as the state appeals a decision that has sent couples flocking to county clerk offices for marriage licenses. Judge Robert J. Shelby overturned Utah's ban on same-sex marriage Friday, ruling the voter-approved measure is a violation of gay couples' constitutional rights. The state then asked him to put a stop to the weddings, but he rejected the request. Lawyers for the state quickly filed a request with the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to put gay marriage on hold. Happy day: Jax and Heather Collins get married Monday at the Salt Lake County clerk's office . More than 200 gay couples have obtained marriage licenses since Friday in Utah's most populous county. On Monday, an estimated 100 licenses were issued in other counties, while some clerks shut their doors as they awaited Shelby's decision. Couples began lining up Sunday night at the Salt Lake County clerk's office as they hoped to get licenses amid the uncertainty of the pending ruling. They anxiously eyed their cellphones for news on the decision, and a loud cheer erupted once word spread that Shelby wouldn't be blocking weddings. Shelby's decision to overturn Utah's same-sex marriage ban has drawn attention given the state's long-standing opposition to gay marriage and its position as headquarters for the Mormon church. The gay weddings in Salt Lake City were taking place about 3 miles from church headquarters. For now, a state considered one of the nation's most conservative has become the 18th to allow same-sex couples to legally wed, joining the likes of California and New York. They got it: Becky Dustin, left, and Jennifer Rasmussen, right, exit the Salt Lake County clerk's office Monday with their marriage license . It's estimated that nearly two-thirds of Utah's 2.8 million residents are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and Mormons dominate the state's legal and political circles. The Mormon church was one of the leading forces behind California's short-lived ban on same-sex marriage, Proposition 8, which voters approved in 2008. The church said Friday it stands by its support for 'traditional marriage,' and it hopes a higher court validates its belief that marriage is between a man and woman. In court Monday, Utah lawyer Philip Lott repeated the words 'chaotic situation' to describe what has been happening in Utah since clerks started allowing gay weddings. He urged the judge to ""take a more orderly approach than the current frenzy."" 'Utah should be allowed to follow its Democratically chosen definition of marriage,' he said of the 2004 gay marriage ban. Lott said the state was disappointed with Shelby's latest ruling and will continue its legal battle. The long wait: Couples in line for marriage licenses Monday at the Salt Lake County clerk's office . Peggy Tomsic, the lawyer for the same-sex couples who brought the case, called gay marriage the civil rights movement of this generation and said it was the new law of the land in Utah. 'The cloud of confusion that the state talks about is only their minds,' she said. Tomsic said she was relieved that Shelby stuck to his ruling and avoided being pressured by a moral or political majority in the state. 'It's awfully easy to get caught up in the emotion and do a kneejerk reaction,' Tomsic said outside the courthouse in downtown Salt Lake City. 'Fortunately, we have a judge who takes his oath of office seriously.' Meanwhile, couples were getting married once every few minutes in the lobby of the Salt Lake County clerk's office to the sound of string music from a violin duet. Lawyers for the state waged a legal battle on several fronts as they sought to stop the same-sex weddings. Their happiest day: Chris Serrano, left, and Clifton Webb embrace Monday after being married . On Sunday, a federal appeals court rejected the state's emergency request to stay the ruling, saying it couldn't rule on a stay since Shelby had not yet acted on the motion before him. The court quickly rejected a second request from Utah on Monday. The state plans to ask the court a third time to put the process on hold. Adding to the chaos surrounding the situation is the fact that Utah Attorney General John Swallow stepped down about a month ago amid a scandal involving allegations of bribery and offering businessmen protection in return for favors. The state has had an acting attorney general ever since, and Gov. Gary Herbert appointed a replacement Monday who will serve until a special election next year. In Shelby's 53-page ruling, he said the constitutional amendment that Utah voters approved violates gay and lesbian couples' rights to due process and equal protection under the 14th Amendment. Shelby said the state failed to show that allowing same-sex marriages would affect opposite-sex marriages in any way. The decision drew a swift and angry reaction from Herbert, who said he was disappointed in an 'activist federal judge attempting to override the will of the people of Utah.' The state quickly took steps to appeal the ruling and halt the process, setting up Monday's hearing before Shelby. The ruling has thrust Shelby into the national spotlight. He has been on the bench for less than two years, appointed by President Barack Obama after GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch recommended him in November 2011. Shelby served in the Utah Army National Guard from 1988 to 1996 and was a combat engineer in Operation Desert Storm. He graduated from the University of Virginia law school in 1998 and clerked for the U.S. District Judge J. Thomas Greene in Utah, then spent about 12 years in private practice before he became a judge.","Gay marriages were permitted to continue in Utah despite a state request to block them .

The owner and the manager of a nursing home were criticised by a judge yesterday for their heartless neglect of elderly residents. Philip Bentley, 65, was told he had put cost-cutting before welfare while Faheza Simpson, 49, was condemned as a liar and a bully. Jailing them for 12 months, Judge Jonathan Rose highlighted fundamental failures of care at Elm View nursing home in Halifax. Neglect: Philip Bentley, 65 (left), the owner of Elm View care home in West Yorks, was found guilty of neglect along with manager and nurse Faheza Simpson, 49 (right), and the pair were sentenced to 12 months in jail . Problems included poor pressure sore . management, insufficient toilet trips for at-risk residents, lack of . cleaning materials and inadequate record keeping. Simpson, who was described by the Judge as 'a liar and a bully' was found guilty of abusing the same patients, and another 68-year-old Alzheimer's sufferer who was hospitalised with a bedsore after only a week in the home. After that patient was taken away, Bentley had tried to cover up the neglect by hiding the patient's file, asking a nurse to lie on her report, and giving a dishonest statement himself. During the trial the court heard that in 2011 visiting nurses had found a patient lying in her own urine, that due to a lack of wipes patients were cleaned using their own underwear, and that one woman was left wearing the same incontinence pad for 13 hours. Sentencing the pair at Bradford Crown Court, Judge Jonathan Rose said there were not enough cleaning materials at the home, records were poorly kept and that patients were not turned or taken to the toilet often enough. He also highlighted a lack of staff, saying that Simpson's bullying manner drove employees away while Bentley failed to recruit more in the mistaken belief that his head nurse could cope. He added that while Bentley had bought the home in good faith in 1990, by 2011 when the investigation started he seemed to have lost interest in. The victims included two Alzheimer's patients, two people who could not move, and one 68-year-old man who was hospitalised after only a week in the home (file picture) Judge Rose said his actions were 'simply unforgivable' and told him: 'You put the saving of money, perhaps your profit, over the welfare of elderly and vulnerable patients. 'A home is not like stocks and shares. It cannot be bought and used only as a means of collecting dividends and profits to be cashed in when the profit will be at its greatest. It is a gathering of humans.' Today, Elizabeth Wright, from CPS Yorkshire and Humberside, said: 'This was a very distressing case involving the wilful neglect of vulnerable, elderly residents at Elm View care home in Halifax. 'Through not taking appropriate action, many residents developed pressure sores, or experienced rapid worsening of existing sores. 'These were not treated properly, and the worst cases were not reported, as they should have been, for specialised external nursing treatment. 'As a result these elderly people were left in conditions of unrelieved discomfort and some must have been suffering considerable pain.'","Philip Bentley and Faheza Simpson jailed for 12 months .

Jailed: Denis MacShane has been sentenced to six months in prison for cheating his expenses . A former Labour minister was jailed for six months yesterday for fraudulently claiming £13,000 in parliamentary expenses to pay for jaunts to Europe. Denis MacShane, who had previously dismissed the expenses scandal ‘as a wonderful moment of British fiddling’, said ‘Cheers’ as his sentence was announced. The one-time BBC journalist then muttered ‘quelle surprise’ as he was led from the dock. MacShane, 65, had admitted faking 19 invoices for ‘research and translation services’ amounting to £12,900 between 2005 and 2008. He submitted them through a company that he set up under a false identity and used nine different spellings of his name so officials would think the paperwork had been filled in by others. A minister for Europe under Tony Blair, MacShane used the money to fund trips to the Continent, including one to judge a literary competition in Paris. Jailing him, Mr Justice Sweeney said his ‘considerable and repeated’ dishonesty had ‘reduced confidence in our priceless democratic system’. ‘There was deliberate, oft repeated and prolonged dishonesty over a period of years – involving a flagrant breach of trust and consequent damage to Parliament,’ he said. ‘You were an MP – and a minister at the time of four of the claims – and knew that you were required to act with probity and transparency in the making of expenses claims. You deliberately created misleading and deceptive invoices and then used them in order to procure payments of public money.’ Mr Justice Sweeney said the deception was calculated to avoid suspicion falling on his claims before adding: ‘You have no one to blame but yourself.’ Parliamentary authorities began looking at MacShane’s claims in 2009 when the expenses scandal engulfed Westminster. John Lyon, the Commons’ Standards Commissioner, raised concerns over claims for ‘translation services’ from the European Policy Institute – a think-tank that he founded. MacShane first admitted to officials that he had submitted invoices signed with what he called ‘a nom de plume’ and described the EPI as a ‘convenient vehicle’ to fund research trips to the continent. But a subsequent investigation by the Commons’ Standards and Privileges Committee described his actions as the ‘gravest case which has come to us for adjudication, rather than being dealt with under the criminal law’. It recommended that MacShane should be suspended as an MP for 12 months but he resigned as the member for Rotherham in November 2012 before the punishment could be imposed. Sentence: MacShane, pictured arriving at the Old Bailey today, will serve six months in prison . 'Cheers, quelle surprise': MacShane outside court. One former Labour colleague sprang to his defence . Police, who had dropped an investigation in 2009, reopened their inquiry and MacShane was charged in May. He was the sixth MP to be prosecuted over expenses and admitted false accounting at the Old Bailey last month. Notably absent from court was his girlfriend, Vicky Pryce, 61, the ex-wife of Liberal Democrat Chris Huhne. She was released in May after serving two months for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice after she took the blame for speeding points that should have been picked up by Huhne, the former energy secretary, who was also jailed. MacShane is expected to serve half his sentence before being released. The invoices were signed by MacShane under the name of E.J. Matthews, the general manager of the company based at an address in Fulham, south-west London. In power: MacShane, pictured in 2002 with then Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, served as Europe minister under Tony Blair . Parliamentary authorities began looking at MacShane's claims in 2009 when the MPs' expenses scandal engulfed Westminster. He was referred to Scotland Yard within months. However, due to Parliamentary privilege, officers were unable to access damning evidence in which MacShane detailed how signatures on receipts from the European Policy Institute (EPI) had been faked. It was not until after police dropped the case last year that the cross-party standards committee published the evidence in a report that recommended an unprecedented 12-month suspension from the House. MacShane, who served as Europe minister under Tony Blair, resigned as MP for Rotherham last November before his suspension could be imposed. He accepted that he made a 'grotesque mistake', but argued there was no personal gain from the claims. The Glasgow-born politician, who was elected as an MP in 1994, was the sixth MP to face court proceedings over the expenses scandal that rocked Westminster. Elliot Morley, David Chaytor, Jim Devine, and Eric Illsley were locked up in 2011 for fiddling their expenses - all four men have now been released from prison. Resigned: MacShane, pictured outside an earlier hearing, quit as an MP in teh wake of the allegations . Grief: MacShane's ex-partner Carol Barnes, left, and their daughter Clare, right, both died in the past decade . Margaret Moran, who fiddled £53,000 in the worst case of dishonesty in the scandal, was let off with a two-year supervision and treatment order last December after claims she was suffering from mental illness. Between them they claimed around £127,000, of which former environment minister Morley admitted to claiming more than £30,000. Two Tory peers, Lord Taylor of Warwick and Lord Hanningfield, were jailed for cheating the taxpayer of around £25,000. A fellow Labour MP argued that it was wrong to jail MacShane because he has already 'been punished enough' for his fraud and did not personally profit from the false claims. Tom Harris, a former transport minister, said: 'Everyone accepts - the CPS and the police accept - that Denis did not personally gain from his behaviour. 'He admits that he was wrong and I think there was a very strong case for a non-custodial sentence. I think it is very disappointing that the judge decided to treat him as MPs who had gained personally from their fraudulent activities. 'Denis is not in the same category. He made no personal gain. He has been punished enough. He was forced out of Parliament, he had to give up his seat and I think he has suffered enough.'","Ex-MP pleaded guilty last month to false accounting by filing 19 receipts .

Every year, Obama and his family return to his birth state on the sun-scorched shores of Oahu. And every year - until now - congressional squabbling has forced the Obamas to delay their trip or cut it short. This year, Obama was cleared for an on-time departure by Congress, which defied pessimistic expectations last week by passing a bipartisan budget deal, all but ensuring the government won't shut down over the next two years. It was a far cry from presaging a new era of cooperation, to be sure, but a silver lining for Obama a day earlier as he acknowledged a year of frustrating 'ups and downs' in an end-of-year news conference.

The first family are spending their sixth Christmas in a row in Hawaii which will cost taxpayers $100,000 . The president has no public events scheduled during his vacation, which is expected to last through January 5. In previous years, frequent golf outings have accompanied trips to local restaurants and other island outings. A few weeks of low-key rest and relaxation would be a welcome change of pace for Obama, who reflected on a high-stakes year of brinkmanship and health care woes as he packed his bags for Hawaii. 'The end of the year is always a good time to reflect and see what can you do better next year,' Obama said Friday. 'I'm sure that I will have even better ideas after a couple days of sleep and sun.' Last year, Obama had to temporarily abandon his vacation to fly home amid a congressional standoff over the so-called fiscal cliff. The year before, a showdown over payroll tax cuts forced him to delay the start of his Hawaii hiatus. In 2010, it was congressional wrangling over repeal of the ban on gays in the military and other issues that delayed the trip. And in 2009, Senate deliberations over Obama's signature health care law meant that Honolulu had to wait another few days.

Conditions seem ripe this year for a few weeks of interrupted family time. Obama did spend part of Saturday morning conferring with top national security aides about the situation in South Sudan, where U.S. military aircraft evacuating Americans from the violence-plagued African nation came under gunfire and had to divert to Uganda. The White House said four U.S. troops were injured in that incident. Throughout his vacation Obama will continue to get regular briefings from advisers traveling with him, White House officials said. Obama and his supporters were hoping those routine updates wouldn't interfere with regular rounds of golf and family outings for shave ice, the Hawaii version of a snow cone.

It is one of the most inspiring moments in military history – British and German soldiers downing their guns on Christmas Day to play football together in the mud of No Man’s Land. But previously unseen documents show not everyone in the trenches during the truce of 1914 was quite such a good sport. The 1st Battalion of the Cameronians – formed of men from the tough streets of Glasgow – simply ignored the offer to take part. Rare find: This recently discovered photograph is one of a haul showing the soldiers of the 1st Cameronians - who refused to shake hands with their German enemies on Christmas Day, 1914 . When a German soldier shouted over . from the opposing trench ‘Tommy, Tommy why you not come across?’ a gruff . Glaswegian voice replied: ‘Cause we don’t trust you and ye hae been . four months shooting at us.’ A record of the conversation has been . released by journalist Andrew Davidson, from memoirs and photographic . albums compiled by his grandfather Fred, who served as a medical officer . with the battalion. Among the documents are Christmas photographs . which show the Cameronians stayed in their trenches near the northern . French town of Armentieres. Mr Davidson, from Kent, said: ‘The . Cameronians were a bunch of bloody-minded Glaswegians. Even though it . was Christmas they were pretty grumpy and saw no reason why they should . play football with people who had been trying to kill them a day . before.’ An estimated 100,000 men are thought to have taken part in . the unofficial – and unrepeated – truce along the Western Front, which . included gift-giving. Stubborn: Even though it was Christmas the men saw no reason why they should do what some of their colleagues did and play football with people who had been trying to kill them the day before . Instead of emerging from their . trenches near the northern French town of Armentieres to shake hands . with the enemy, the Cameronians dug in and did what they could to make . Christmas Day 99 years ago as memorable as possible. The . Christmas photos and exchanges came to light thanks when writer Andrew . Davidson discovered three battered photograph albums compiled by his . grandfather, Fred Davidson, who served as a medical officer with the . regiment during WW1. The . soldiers were officially banned from taking cameras into the . rat-infested trenches, but despite this they took snaps of each other . to raise their spirits amid the horrors of the daily carnage they were . witnessing. Their pocket . Kodak cameras recorded the grainy snapshots of a regiment that . had an unequivocal attitude to the Germans embedded nearby - even at . Christmas. Fred Davidson, who always carried his camera in his vest pocket, took a set of pictures of the 1st Cameronians that included stretcher bearers and a soldier draped in tinsel as he held a dog by a lead in a trench. He later captioned the picture of the soldier and dog 'Xmas 1914. Father Xmas in trenches'. Many soldiers kept mongrels they had adopted as strays to keep the rat population under control. Festive: One soldier in the trenches has added pieces of tinsel to his uniform, as he holds his dog on a lead, while his comrades pretend to load their weapons for Fred Davidson's trusty camera . The five stretcher bearers, non of . them wearing protective helmets, were wrapped up in what they called . 'teddy bears' - goatskin jerkins issued to combat the biting wind. The . absence of helmets was down to the lack of equipment supplied to the . British troops early in the war compared to their German foe who had the . best and latest military hardware and clothing available. Painstaking . research conducted by Andrew Davidson has now resulted in the book . Fred's War - A Doctor In The Trenches - based on the 250 pictures . covering 1914 and 1915 as his grandfather served as a 25-year-old doctor . with the Cameronians. Contraband: Officially the soldiers were banned from taking cameras into the trenches, although the rule did not stop Fred and his trusty Kodak Vest Pocket camera . Mr Davidson, a 54-year-old journalist . who lives in Kent, said: 'Basically the Cameronians were a bunch of . bloody-minded Glaswegians. 'Even . though it was Christmas they were pretty grumpy and saw no reason why . they should do what some of their colleagues did and play football with . people who had been trying to kill them the day before. 'But . these pictures show real people in real war situations at Christmas. The regiment was on it's last day of five days fighting on the front . line before they were due some time off in the bars and brothels of . nearby Armentieres on Boxing Day. 'Men love dogs and this one had obviously been left behind by fleeing refugees. The sign around the soldier's neck says something like Happy Noel but it is impossible to read it properly. 'The stretcher bearers picture shows how ill-equipped the British Army was. Non of these men went out into no-man's-land to get their injured mates even under heavy fire wearing helmets. They didn't have them. 'They resemble just a piratical rabble more than British soldiers.' On Boxing Day the Cameronians were relieved of their front line duties by men of the East Yorkshire regiment and returned to billets in Armentieres for what diaries of the time describe as a 'prolonged alcoholic party.' Andrew Davidson never knew his grandfather who died two days before he was born. The photo albums had been handed down through the generations. It was forbidden under Army orders to use cameras while serving on the front line but the commanding officer of the Cameronians knew his men were using the earliest folding Kodak cameras and turned a blind eye. Fred Davidson was wounded but survived the war as did his unique photos. Find: The Christmas photos came to light after Andrew Davidson discovered three battered photograph albums compiled by his grandfather Fred . Mr Davidson added: 'It was a regiment happy to make its own rules and the officers thought nothing of breaking Army rules. 'Thank goodness they did because we have these wonderful pictures. 'They were a group of men who certainly liked having their pictures taken and it has left a fantastic record of what life was like in the trenches. 'We can look at the picture now and maybe feel blessed that our Christmas will be happy, warm and safe.'","Photographs show the 1st Cameronians enjoying Christmas Day 1914 .

People with noble-sounding surnames such as King and Prince are more likely than the average person to work as managers, a new study suggests. However, those with names of everyday occupations like Cook and Farmer have a lower than average chance and are more likely to remain lower down the career ladder. Individuals with prestigious names who have achieved high-ranking jobs include Lord King, former governor of the Bank of England and Lord Judge, the former Lord Chief Justice. A survey of 223,000 German workers by Cambridge Business School has found that people with 'royal sounding' names were more likely to hold managerial positions . The findings come from a study by the University of Cambridge's Judge Business School, which looked at nearly 223,000 German workers. People with surnames such as Kaiser (emperor), Kvnig (king) and F|rst (prince) were more likely to hold managerial positions than those called Koch (cook), Bauer (farmer), and Becker/Bdcker (baker). 'This phenomenon occurs despite the fact that noble-sounding surnames never indicated that the person actually held a noble title,' the authors wrote. It appears that the status associated with a name can 'spill over to its bearer, influencing the status accorded to that person and consequential life outcomes, such as his or her career advancement.' The status linked to surnames could shape interpretations of workplace performance or drive people with noble names to 'actively pursue high-status jobs', the authors said. Conversely those with more 'working class' names such as baker and cook were less likely to be in charge . Reporting their findings in the journal Psychological Science, the authors said that in terms of career outcomes 'characteristics about a person that logic dictates should not make a difference often do.' They compared their research to past studies, which have found taller people tend to get higher-status and better paid jobs. A 'metaphorical association between height and high social status leads us to believe someone taller would make a better CEO and in a similar way someone with a noble name 'may be seen as more worthy of occupying a managerial position'. The study involved using the website Xing, the German equivalent of LinkedIn, to collect information on people with the 100 most common German surnames, plus all people with 'noble sounding' last names. This led to analysis of 222,924 employees and managers with 84 different last names, showing that noble names really do appear to have career benefits.","Cambridge Business School looked at names of 223,000 German workers .

It started with a simple request on Facebook to help C.J. - who was only 20 when he died - 'see the mountains that he never got to climb, see the vast oceans that he would have loved, see tropical beaches and lands far and away'. The post was shared by nearly 100 of her friends, and soon even strangers started offering to scatter C.J.'s ashes in their hometowns, on family vacations or just somewhere beautiful. She started a separate Facebook page called 'Scattering C.J.', which now has more than 1,200 likes. The pictures and videos on Facebook tell the story of where C.J. has been.

Twomey regrets rolling her eyes at her son instead of hugging him as he stormed out of their home after an argument. A few minutes later, C.J. shot himself in his car in front of the home, she said. C.J., who thrived on adventure like . jumping out of airplanes, was upset about not making a special forces . team with the Air Force, she said.

About 150 packets of his ashes have traveled so far and 300 other people have offered to share in CJ's journey. When most of C.J.'s ashes have been scattered, Twomey hopes to put together a book with all the notes and photos people have sent her. The proceeds would go to the New England Organ Bank, she said. Many of those offering to help scatter C.J.'s ashes have also been affected by suicide or lost children. The kindness has been overwhelming, she said. 'Really, why would a complete . stranger want to help us?' she said. 'I really think people are doing . whatever they can, even if it's a small thing, to ease our burden or to . embrace life.'

Peyton Manning has broken Tom Brady's NFL record for most touchdown passes in a season with 51. Denver's Manning did it on a 25-yard pass to Julius Thomas with 4:28 remaining in the game on Sunday against the Texans. Just 2 1-2 minutes earlier, he tied the mark with a 20-yard pass to Eric Decker. 'I really feel like it's a team accomplishment, certainly an offensive accomplishment,' Manning said. 'There's a lot of people that played roles in this.' Peyton Manning has broken Tom Brady's NFL record for most touchdown passes in a season with 51 . Manning made the throw to Thomas and walked toward the end zone, where his teammates patted him on the head. He then took off his helmet and walking to the sideline and pumped his fist once. His teammates came out to greet him and he gave dozens of high-fives as he grinned and walked to the bench. Decker picked up the ball after Thomas dropped it and tucked it in the side of his jersey, where it remained as he walked off the field. Manning entered the game with 47 TDs and his first touchdown came on a 36-yard pass to Demaryius Thomas in the second quarter. The second one was a 10-yard throw to Decker early in the fourth period. Manning waves to fans following the Denver Broncos game on Sunday against the Houston Texans during which he threw his 51st touchdown pass of the season . Manning celebrates with his teammates after breaking the record of the most touchdown passes thrown in a season during Sunday's game against the Texans . 'We're not surprised at what Peyton does,' Julius Thomas said. 'The work he puts in every day, you see how he demands the best from himself. Fortunate for us, we're the beneficiaries of that.' Brady set the record, which previously belonged to Manning, in 2007. Manning had established the record by throwing 49 touchdown passes in 2004. 'They were able to make the big plays and we weren't able to stop them from doing that,' Houston safety Shiloh Keo said. Surrounded by the best targets he's ever had, operating a turbocharged assault with a body that's much less a question mark, Manning is putting up record numbers like he did in that remarkable 2004 season. That year, Marvin Harrison, Reggie Wayne and Brandon Stokley all topped 1,000 yards receiving. Manning established NFL records with 49 touchdown throws and a 121.1 passer rating, marks since surpassed by Brady and Aaron Rodgers (122.5). Manning broke the record with a 25-yard pass to Julius Thomas with 4:28 remaining in the game on Sunday against the Texans . Manning was the NFL's 2012 Comeback Player of the Year, showing he was every bit as good as before. He's having his best season at age 37, just two years removed from the four neck surgeries that weakened his right triceps and threatened his career. He hadn't missed a start with the Colts before 2011. Last week, Houston interim coach Wade Phillips said Manning's season was 'just the best year ever of any quarterback.' Manning began 2013 by becoming the first quarterback since 1969 to throw for seven touchdowns in a game. Earlier this month he broke an NFL record he held with Brett Favre for most playoff appearances when he qualified for his 13th trip to the postseason. Although he could set several more standards this season, Manning has insisted his only concern is the Broncos' win-loss record. He wants desperately to gain home-field advantage and the top seed in the AFC playoffs again. Manning finished Sunday's game with a career-high 5,211 yards passing. He is 266 from surpassing the single-season record for yards passing set by Drew Brees in 2011. Manning threw 37 touchdown passes last year, which broke a franchise record of 27 set by John Elway in 1997 and tied by Jake Plummer in 2004.

The daughter of NFL legend Joe Namath received some shocking news last week about a dog she'd lost more than five years ago: the animal was alive and well and living about 200 miles from her Florida home. Jessica Namath, a 28-year-old photographer, lost her pet Shih Tzu, Tula, at the home of her former fiance in 2008, when the dog wandered into the front yard, which was not uncommon for the animal. Ten minutes later, however, Tula was gone - and Namath was devastated. Found: Jessica Namath's dog Tula ran away five years ago but was discovered this week 200 miles from home . Shocked: Jessica Namath (right) was stunned when a man called to tell her he found the dog she lost five years ago . Namath went to great lengths to find the dog - knocking on neighbors' doors, making calls to the Highway Patrol and animal control and placing fliers throughout the area. Namath and friends even searched nearby canals in kayaks, and she went so far as to visit three different psychics looking for her lost pooch. She even offered a reward of $2,000 for anyone who could locate her lost dog. All of her efforts were for naught, though, and the dog appeared to be lost forever. On Wednesday, Namath got a call from 42-year-old Michael Cecere, who lives about 200 miles away in St. Petersburg. Earlier that afternoon, Cecere had been running errands when a small, brown Shih Tzu wandered in front of his car. He took the dog to houses in the area in an attempt to find the owner, but nobody recognized the small dog. Cecere then took the dog to the ParkView Animal Hospital, where a tracking chip embedded in the animal revealed that it belonged to Jessica Namath. Survivor: When Tula was found she was missing teeth and was in poor health . Desperate: Namath did everything she could to find her lost dog, including consulting psychics . cecere tracked down Namath's current phone number on Facebook and gave her a call. 'I could hear her jaw drop over the phone,' Cecere told the Tampa Bay Times. The next day, Cecere met her in Yeehaw Junction - about halfway between Jupiter and St. Petersburg - and returned the long, lost dog. Upon meeting, both Namath and Cecere had the same question: how did the dog end up 200 miles away from home? Enter Yanelys Miranda, who says she found the dog about a year after it disappeared from Namath's former finace's yard. Miranda says she found the mangy dog on a street in West Palm Beach - not far from Jupiter - and it had missing teeth, sores and hair peeling off in chunks. 'She was almost dying,' Miranda said. 'The poor thing.' Legend: Joe Namath was inducted into the Football Hall of Fame in 1985 . Miranda says she and her family - including two children, ages 7 and 11 - nursed the dog back to health and it became part of the family. She says she didn't think to look for an identification chip because of the poor condition the dog was in. In 2011, Miranda and her family moved to St. Petersburg and brought their beloved Shih Tzu, which they named Lulu, along.

Thief: Daphne Whited stole Christmas decorations and lights from front gardens in Florida . A Christmas decoration thief has been outed on Facebook after a man offered to help her load the stolen goods into her car before taking her photo. Daphne Whited, 44, drove around a neighbourhood in Florida stealing festive lights and decorations from front gardens. She stashed the goods into the back of her waiting vehicle, before driving to her next target. However, she was caught red-handed after resident Sean Young spotted her stealing decorations from his garden in the Tributary Street neighbourhood in Pensacola, Escambia. Mr Young offered to help Whited load the festive goods into her car before taking out a camera and snapping her photo. He then uploaded the image to Facebook in a bid to identify the thief, reported NorthEscambia.com. 'I asked her if she needed help putting my stuff in her car,' Mr Young wrote on the social-networking site. 'Then I took her picture.' Whited was later arrested by police and charged with multiple counts of petit larceny and possession of marijuana. She was found to have stolen decorations from a number of houses, according to the Escambia County Sheriff's Office. Scene: She was caught red-handed by resident Sean Young in the Tributary Street neighbourhood (above) Whited blamed her actions on a Craigslist advert claiming the posting said the decorations were 'free for the taking'. She was later released from Escambia County Jail on a $1,000 (Â£611) bond while the stolen decorations were returned to their rightful owners. It isn't the first time a 'real-life Grinch' has been caught red-handed stealing Christmas decorations. Earlier this month, a thief stole a Santa figure from the front garden of an elderly couple in Inverurie, Aberdeenshire. Kathy and Alistair Cowell were devastated when they spotted the criminal dragging the prized decoration into a car before speeding off. However, the thief later returned the prized decoration with a guilt-ridden apology from 'the guy who stole your Santa', according to the Daily Mirror.","Daphne Whited stole Christmas decorations from gardens in Florida .

If you think your Christmas schedule is hectic, then spare a thought for mother-of-nine Rayna Warriner, from Bournemouth,  whose festive preparations begin in January and are planned with military precision. Rayna, 39, spends all year organising the festivities for her large brood of children, all aged between six and 16. To ensure she sticks to her strict budget of £3,000, she starts shopping for bargain gifts in the New Year sales - 11 months before the big day. Big family: Rayna has nine children and needs a 10.6kg turkey and eight tins of Quality Street to feed them . Tough job: Rayner Warriner starts preparing for Christmas in January and needs 110m paper to wrap her gifts . 'For most people Christmas is busy but for me it's an average day,' explains Rayna. 'I . hear people tell me they are worried because they have nine people . coming for dinner, and then it dawns on them that it's a usual thing for . me. 'But it is brilliant fun and I love making it magical for the children, it makes me feel like I have done my job for them. 'I . think the key to running Christmas smoothly with a big family like ours . is organisation, and also realising that you are only one person and . you can only do your best.' To ensure the day goes perfectly for Eryn, 16, Jackson, 14, Harrison, 13, Callan, 11, Taitum, 10, triplets Meredith, Romany, and Ilish, aged eight and Avie, six, Rayna writes her food list weeks in advance and fills two large shopping trolleys with goods worth £550, including a 10.6kg turkey. Along with the turkey she buys eight bottles of soft drink, six tins of Quality Street and dozens of boxes of biscuits. Rayna's little helpers: All of the children, and husband Malcolm, pitch in and help put up the tree . Presents take five nights to wrap and require an astonishing 110 metres of paper, as well as piles of ribbon and bows. Once the festive period gets underway, she and her husband Malcolm, a police sergeant, attend no fewer than six nativity plays starring their youngest five children.

Rayna, who now works as a stress management consultant, says the experience of planning Christmas for her large family has provided her with useful lessons to teach her clients.

'By the time August comes around, I really start getting it in my mind and start buying their main presents.' But present buying doesn't always go entirely to plan, so Rayna schedules in time for returning gifts should the children change their minds ahead of the big day. 'With new adverts on TV and new toys out all the time, what the children want can change all the time so sometimes I have to return and swap a few gifts over the year. 'I spend about three days wrapping presents and on Christmas Eve I stay up until about 3am putting them in their stockings and hanging them up. 'Once they have opened their stockings we all go to church because I think that shows them what the true meaning of Christmas is.

Unlike lotteries that offer one large jackpot, Spain's yuletide drawing sprinkles a variety of winnings on thousands of ticketholders. Tales of joy and celebration were widely broadcast on TV stations, providing Spain's struggling population a rare moment of joy after another year of a brutal financial crisis.

Americans had been told that they would have to sign up for health insurance through the ever-breaking healthcare.gov site by the end of Monday night but now it has been revealed that the deadline has been covertly pushed back one more day to try to give more people a chance. Two anonymous officials announced that the 11.59pm deadline that had been set for tonight was pushed back to Tuesday- Christmas Eve- over the weekend, according to The Washington Post. The White House has insisted that it is doing all it can to make sure people who miss the deadline can still get coverage under a series of exemptions, and apparently this date bait-and-switch is another way of trying to help. Scroll down for video . Time's up: President Obama, seen here at his brother-in-law's basketball game on Sunday in Hawaii, has been roundly criticized for the roll out of his signature health care legislation . There is a 'hardship' exception for . some that permits them not to sign up any kind of health insurance at . all without facing a penalty - the hardship being problems they've . encountered with Obamacare and its malfunctioning website . HealthCare.gov. There will also be a 'good faith exception' for others, according to a senior Obama administration official. 'We'll have a special enrollment period,' the official said last week, for 'all those who make a good faith effort to get enrolled by the deadline' but fail to do so. The official did not say how the government would determine whether or not the effort was made in good faith. Not working: Many last-minute users noted that the website continued to crash on Monday as they tried to sign up on the final day- not knowing the deadline had been pushed back secretly over the weekend . Still others may simply get a break from insurance companies, which the administration has urged to be flexible with people who miss the deadline. Such is the uncertain state of 'Obamacare' as it approaches what was originally supposed to be a defining moment - a signup deadline that would provide the first real test of the viability of the healthcare program brought into law by the Affordable Care Act. Adding to the confusion is the fact that the original deadline for obtaining medical coverage was December 15. That was extended to December 23 after the federal government's website, HealthCare.gov, proved dysfunctional and sometimes non-functional. Problems: Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius is seen here during a photo op when the troubled website didn't work when it was meant to . The administration has reserved the right to change the deadline again 'should exceptional circumstances pose barriers to consumers' enrolling on or before Monday. Obama said on Friday that one million people had enrolled for new insurance plans under the law through HealthCare.gov, which serves 36 states, and 14 state-run marketplaces. Many more enrollments are a major priority for Obama's signature healthcare reform, which officials are still hoping will help millions of uninsured and under-insured Americans finally to obtain medical coverage by the end of March. It is not known how many consumers may have no insurance coverage during periods of 2014 because they failed to sign up on HealthCare.gov by Monday. Some of the 14 states running their own healthcare exchanges have extended their sign-up deadlines past December 23. On Thursday, the administration announced that if people's old insurance plans were canceled because of new standards under the law, they can claim a 'hardship' exemption to the requirement that all Americans must have coverage by March 31 or face penalties that start at $95 so some of these people may not sign up. The Obama administration says it is trying to be flexible, but some Republican critics of the law say the frequent delays and changes have muddied the waters and confused people. Trying everything: President and Mrs Obama met with a group of mothers last week in an effort to persuade them to have their children sign up for the healthcare insurance . 'With no clarity as to when people should sign up and who they should pay and when, it's a virtual certainty that many consumers will find themselves uncovered for a period of time through no fault of their own,' Senator Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican, said last week. Administration officials said on Friday there are fewer than 500,000 people who have received cancellation notices from their insurance companies and have not yet found alternatives. Some were 'auto-enrolled' in other plans by their insurance companies, the officials said. The pace of sign-ups has picked up since October and November when technical problems crippled the HealthCare.gov website. Anyone who tried the website in October and November and became stuck has been getting attention from the administration. Officials sent more than two million emails to people who could not advance through the website. They have also made more than 600,000 phone calls to consumers and mailed notices to hundreds of thousands of people, officials said. 'We are confident that we are doing everything we can so that individuals know what their options are to get coverage, whether it is at the marketplace or seeking it through the private insurers,' said the senior official.","Monday December 23 was the original deadline for signing up for health insurance but now that has been pushed back to Tuesday night .

In Wisconsin, locals are using the region's famous cheese production facilities as a way to keep streets safe during the busy holiday travel season.

'If this takes off, if this proves to be a success here, I’m sure that it will be used in cities all over the country.' Municipalities in the region are turning to alternative de-icers like cheese brine for a more earth and cost-friendly alternative to regular road salt.

A recent spate of unusual weather hasn’t changed the question on the minds of many – ‘what about a white Christmas?’ Chances are that if there is snow on the ground now, it will stick around the next two days. The Rocky Mountains and the Great Lakes are a virtual lock. The rest of the US may not be so festive. A white Christmas is defined by there being at least one inch of snow on the ground, according to the Weather Channel. Widespread: Snow is possible for a wide swath of the northern half of the country, but most of it is not expected to amount to any sizable accumulation . Too warm: It is simply too warm in most of the country for snow to fall or stick around . Most of the Northeast has little shot at a white Christmas. Warmer than average temperatures the past few days – highs eclipsed 70 degrees Sunday in New York – and abundant rain have washed away any snow there may have been. Temperatures will cool back to around freezing by the holiday, but no snow is forecast for most of the region except areas normally affected by lake effect snow. The mountains of northern New York state and New England are already packed with snow and received mainly ice during this weekend’s storm. They should be white come Wednesday. The mid-Atlantic and southeast have virtually no shot at snow in the next few days, nor is any on the ground. Significantly above average temperatures and recent rains washed away any hopes those states may have had. Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow: The northern Great Lakes are the region most likely to have a white Christmas - it will be snowing Christmas Day . Slight cooling: Temperatures will back off from record weekend highs, but not enough in most places for snow . The northern central US is already buried in snow and ice. It should remain so for at least the next few days. Expect to ring in the holiday with sleighs and snow balls from Omaha to Chicago, all the way up to Minnesota and North Dakota. Further west into Montana and Wyoming, as well as all of the Rocky Mountains, a white Christmas is virtually guaranteed. Significant amounts of snow are already on the ground and aren’t expected to melt by the time presents are open Wednesday morning. As usual, the West Coast will not have a white Christmas. What the region gains in mostly amazing weather the rest of the country envies, they give up in having snow on Christmas.

Department store Macy's has a 'secret' black Santa who can only be seen on special request, it has been revealed. And because the store does not advertise the service, most customers are completely unaware it is even an option. The African American version is not publicly promoted, meaning that parents need to know what they are looking for when they bring their children to meet with the character. Reporter Amy Nelson of Animal New York went to the flagship store in Herald Square to see how the issue of dueling Santas was being handled by the cheerful elves. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'Special' Santa: After asking for the 'special' version, an administrator directed Amy to a different version of Father Christmas, showing that the store did have multiple options available . First go around: Animal New York reporter Amy Nelson was automatically taken to the advertised white Santa when she went to the flagship Macy's store in Manhattan recently . She was initially brought first to the lengthy line of children and parents who were waiting patiently for the white Father Christmas. She asked the big man if he was the only Santa in the building, and he stuck to the script. 'That's me- I'm the special Santa, and the everyday Santa and the good-looking Santa and the ugly Santa and the everybody Santa!' the white Santa said. Ms Nelson then asked one of the awaiting elves and who seemed to know exactly what she was talking about when she asked for the 'special Santa'. The man directed her towards the elves in the 'maze' of a line who could then 'set that up' for her. Hefty line: The wait for the white Santa topped out at more than 45 minutes . Personal attention: There was only one little girl in line waiting for the black Santa . 'About five minutes later, an official-looking woman not dressed as an elf brought me to another lodge... where a toddler-aged black girl and her black mother were wrapping up their time with a black Santa Claus,' Ms Nelson wrote. Diversity issues and political correctness are not the only two reasons why the question of a black Santa has become a hot-topic this holiday season as Fox News host Megyn Kelly declared that 'Santa just is white'. She later apologized on air and said that she meant the comment comically, though that didn't stop Jon Stewart and Saturday Night Live from skewering her segment. The black Santa in Macy's made a clear effort to stay out of the fray and avoid getting involved in the debate when asked by Ms Nelson. 'I've heard of this story but Santa hasn't had much time to sit down and watch TV. This is the busiest time of the season!' the black Santa told Ms Nelson. MailOnline's multiple calls to Macy's press representatives were not immediately answered.

Chicago Bears defensive tackle Henry Melton has been arrested and charged with public intoxication and assault. The six-foot-three, 295-pound lineman allegedly punched the manager of the Chill Sports Bar and Grill in Grapevine, Texas, in the face and bit his arm at 1:45am Monday morning. It reportedly took four waitstaff to restrain Melton, 27, until police arrived. Bloodied: Melton's mugshot shows the cut nose he sustained after the alleged altercation with a restaurant manager . According to the Star Telegram, Melton was asked to leave the bar and restaurant after becoming belligerent and abusing staff. He then became involved in an altercation with the manager during which he punched the man and bit his arm. Robert Eberling, spokesman for the Grapevine Police Department, said the pro-footballer refused treatment for a cut he sustained on his nose. He posted $1210 bail and was released from prison this morning. Melton's agent, Jordan Woy, told ESPN.com that his client has acknowledged getting into an argument with a bartender but says he is innocent of assault. 'It's still preliminary, and we're looking into everything,' Woy told ESPN.com. 'But Henry said he didn't do anything. He said he didn't throw a punch at anybody and that he got jumped by a couple of bouncers on the way out.'

The former boyfriend of Amanda Knox has been spotted out on the town with a mystery woman in the Dominican Republic. Raffaele Sollecito, 29, was pictured with the attractive young woman in the capital Santo Domingo. The woman was pictured putting her hand on his chest and also draping an arm around him as they walked along at night. Knox, now 26, and former boyfriend Sollecito served four years for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher before being freed on appeal in 2011. Flirting: Raffaele Sollecito, 29, was spotted with the attractive young woman in the capital of the Dominican Republic, Santo Domingo . Embrace: The woman was wearing a figure-hugging pair of green jeans and a tight white vest top . The body of Miss Kercher, 21, from Coulsdon, South London, was found half-naked in the cottage in perugia, Italy, she shared with Knox. She had been raped and her throat slashed, her body left beneath a blanket in her bedroom. IT graduate Sollecito and Knox drew attention for their behaviour after the Leeds University student's death in November 2007. Then, in March this year, Italy’s highest court sensationally ordered the pair to stand retrial. Sollecito said he had been portrayed as a 'ruthless assassin' and said he had suffered since he and American student Knox were arrested after Miss Kercher’s body was found in the cottage she shared with Knox in Perugia. The pair seemed happy and relaxed as they talked on the street. It is not known how the pair met . Sollecito and a woman sit at a table outside a restaurant. Sollecito spoke out against being perceived as a 'ruthless killer' last month . 'I have been described as a ruthless killer but I am nothing of the sort,' said Mr Sollecito. The accusations against them were 'absurd', he said during his first appearance at the appeals trial in November. After leaving jail in 2011, Knox immediately returned to her hometown of Seattle. Knox has been in a relationship with classical guitar student James Terrano, 25, for more than two years. But in March this year, Italy's highest court sent the case back to the appeals stage, over aspects of the evidence it argued had not been properly examined before. A third accused, Rudy Guede, was convicted in a fast-track trial and is serving a 16-year sentence in the murder. Relaxing: The 29-year-old was on holiday in the Dominican Republic . Sollecito called the accusations against himself and Knox 'absurd' Knox says she was ‘psychologically . tortured’ by Italian police investigating the death of Meredith Kercher . who tried to make her confess. In . an email to the court in Florence, where she is facing retrial for the . murder of Miss Kercher, Knox said that she was too ‘afraid’ to return to . Italy. Couple: Amanda Knox holds hands with her boyfriend James Terrano in downtown Seattle in March . She wrote: ‘We need to recognise that a person can be brought to confess falsely because they were psychologically tortured. ‘They lied to me, yelled at me, threatened me, slapped me twice on the head. ‘They told me that I would never see my family if I did not remember what had happened to Meredith that night’. Writing from Seattle where she is taking Creative Writing classes, Knox said: ‘I am not in the courtroom because I'm afraid. ‘I fear that the vehemence of the accusations will impress you, will pull the wool over your eyes and will blind you.’ Judge Alessandro Nencini said such an email from a defendant was ‘irregular’. He added: ‘If you want to speak to the trial you have to come to the trial.' In her message, Knox also defended her relationship with Kercher and suggested she would have had no reason to hurt the British student. ‘I didn't kill Meredith. Meredith was my friend,’ she said. ‘She was nice, she helped me, she was generous and funny. She never criticised’. The Supreme Court ruled that the initial forensic evidence had been wrongly dismissed in the acquittal and a prosecution theory about a sex game that went wrong should be re-examined. The prosecutor has requested a 30-year term for Knox and a 26-year prison term for Sollecito for the murder. A decision is expected on January 10.

Jackie Turner, 26, posted an ad on the online marketplace 'looking to rent a mom and dad who can give me attention and make me feel like the light of their life just for a couple of days because I really need it'. The response she received was overwhelming and she was flooded with letters from both prospective parents and other children who felt neglected and in need of some caring attention. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Happy outcome: Jackie Turner has paired up with Anita Hermsmeier who works in student services at her school, William Jessup University . Looking for some love: Jackie received letters from dozens of would-be parents and other students who wanted similar experiences with caring adult mentors . Now she was not only able to find a match for herself but also one for six other students. 'This time of year is hard. Everyone is talking about their cousins, their families, all the things that make up Christmas,' Jackie told CBS News. Jackie got paired up with Anita Hermsmeier, a woman who works in student services at Jackie's college, William Jessup University. 'I've found my mentor!' Jackie said when she and Ms Hermsmeier hugged at the mixer she arranged for the students and parents looking for love. 'People are hurting and broken and we need each other! We need to be loving people,' she said. Adding to the success, none of the would-be 'parents' asked for the $8-per-hour that Jackie offered to pay for their uninterrupted attention. Changing from her past: Jackie, 26, posted an ad on Craigslist seeking to rent a family for the holidays at $8 an hour. She has since received dozens of responses from people willing to take her in for free . Looking at the jovial, straight-A student from William Jessup University, it is hard to imagine the strife she had seen in her 26 years. ‘I've never felt the touch of my Mom hugging me and holding me,’ she told News10.’ I don't know what it's like to look in my dad's eyes and feel love instead of hatred.’ Jackie had been physically, sexually and emotionally abused since she was a little girl. To escape the violence at home, she spent years living on the streets where she had picked up a drug habit and found herself in a gang. Jackie was eventually arrested for grand theft and served nearly a year behind bars - an outcome that marked a turning point in her life. Upon her release in 2010, Jackie decided to go to a religious camp for troubled teens called Christian Encounter Ministries. Three years later, she is now a presidential scholar at William Jessup boasting a 4.0 GPA. She also plays soccer on the school team. Despite her successes, Jackie says she still has a deep void inside her that she feels only a family could fill – even if it's only a rented one. New life: Turner went to a Christian camp (left) and later enrolled in William Jessup University (right), where she is . now a presidential scholar with a 4.0 GPA . ‘My biological parents aren't here, and it's kept this hole inside of me,’ Jackie said. So Turner came up with the idea to lease a family for the holiday season so she could have someone who would listen to her and cry with her - no strings attached. Jackie's bold decision to go public with her pain and longing for a family also struck a chord with other people who had suffered abuse. The college student has been receiving emails from men and women openly discussing their childhood traumas. ‘People are out there with the same heart inside of them,’ she said. ‘Some of them with a greater drive then mine.’","Jackie Turner wrote in her ad she would be willing to pay $8 per hour for a family to sit with her and listen .

All charges against six British Greenpeace activists awaiting trial for protesting in the Arctic look set to be dropped after the passing of a new law in Russia. The 30-member crew of the Greenpeace ship was detained by Russian police during a protest at a floating oil rig in the Arctic. Six British members of the group were held in prison for two months until they were finally released on bail to await their trial for hooliganism in Saint Petersburg. But their charges could now be dropped after Russia's parliament today passed an amendment to an amnesty bill. The 26 non-Russians of the so-called Arctic 30 could now be free to return home as soon as they are given exit visas by the authorities. New law: British Greenpeace activist Alexandra Harris, from Exeter, pictured in court in Saint Petersburg, may finally be able to return home after a new law could see her charges for hooliganism dropped . Released: Anthony Perrett, from Newport in South Wales, was arrested by Russian authorities during a Greenpeace protest in the Arctic - he was freed on bail after spending two months in detention . Finally free: Philip Ball from Oxford was the final British Greenpeace activist to be released from jail in Russia . Britons Philip Ball, from Oxford; Anthony Perrett, from Newport in . south Wales; freelance journalist Kieron Bryan; Alexandra Harris, from . Exeter; Iain Rogers, from Devon, and Frank Hewetson, from London, may now get to spend Christmas at home. But Greenpeace said it was not yet clear when the group will be allowed home, or what will happen to its vessel the Arctic Sunrise, which has remained impounded in Murmansk since the arrests. Ana Paula Maciel from Brazil, one of the activists, said: 'I'm relieved, but I'm not celebrating. I spent two months in jail for a crime I didn't commit and faced criminal charges that were nothing less than absurd. But now at last it seems like this saga could soon be over and it may not be long before we're back with our families. 'Right now, my thoughts are with our Russian colleagues. If they accept this amnesty, they will have criminal records in the country where they live, and all for something they didn't do. All because we stood up for Arctic protection.' British Greenpeace activist Frank Hewetson pictured at a detention hearing at the Kalininskiy Court in St. Petersburg, Russia . Freelance journalist Kieron Bryan, pictured in court, was one of the six Britons held in prison for two months after being arrested by Russian police for a protest in the Arctic . Impounded: A crew member keeps watch aboard a Russian coast guard boat, left, as the Greenpeace ship 'Arctic Sunrise', right, is anchored next to it, in a small bay near Severomorsk, after it was seized by Russian forces . Arctic Sunrise captain Peter Wilcox, of the United States, said: 'I might soon be going home to my family, but I should never have been charged and jailed in the first place. We sailed north to bear witness to a profound environmental threat but our ship was stormed by masked men wielding knives and guns. 'Now it's nearly over and we may soon be truly free, but there's no amnesty for the Arctic. 'We may soon be home, but the Arctic remains a fragile global treasure under assault by oil companies and the rising temperatures they're driving. We went there to protest against this madness. We were never the criminals here.' Russia's state duma voted 446-0 in favour of the amnesty bill, which mainly concerns first-time offenders, juveniles and women with small children. But the amnesty was also extended to suspects of hooliganism who are still awaiting trial, which means the charges against 30 people aboard the Greenpeace ship are likely to be dropped. Freed: Greenpeace International activist and the captain of the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise Peter Willcox of the U.S., leaves gates after being released from 'Kresty' Crosses prison in St.Petersburg . The 26 non-Russian Greenpeace International activists who had not been able to return home from Russia since being arrested . The carefully tailored bill, which . would also see the release of members of the Pussy Riot punk band, . Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alekhina, has been largely perceived as . the Kremlin's attempt to soothe the West's criticism of its human . rights record ahead of the Winter Olympics in Sochi next year. Despite . the expansion of the bill, it is still drawing criticism because it . does not cover former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who has been . widely described as Russia's main political prisoner, and only eight out . of 26 defendants who took part in a 2012 protest rally on the Bolotnaya . square in Moscow that ended in scuffles between protesters and riot . police. Opposition lawmaker Dmitry Gudkov said the amnesty bill 'has buried all hopes of human rights activists and families of political prisoners that their children and family members will be set free'. The amnesty could happen as soon as Thursday, when the bill is expected to be published in the government newspaper. But it allows a six-month period to carry out the amnesty, meaning that some of the prisoners could in theory wait weeks or months before getting released. Lawyers and families of the Pussy Riot members insist that everyone eligible for the release ought to be allowed to walk free as soon as the bill is published. The two are now slated to be released in March. 'We're hoping that in case the bill gets passed, Nadia and Masha will be released on Thursday,' Pyotr Verzilov, Tolokonnikova's husband, told The Associated Press. 'There's nothing to stop this.'

A New Jersey plastic surgeon is performing breast augmentation surgeries while his patients are still awake. Dr Michael Gartner, who has multiple offices in close proximity to New York, has been performing the procedure for just over four years and says it stemmed from client demand. He is able to do this through the use of local anesthesia, satisfying the concerns of patients worried about not waking up after taking general anesthesia while under the knife, he told MailOnline. Virtually painless: Dr Michael Gartner asserts that the procedure is virtually painless, and that most patients only feel minor discomfort . Dr Gartner said that he believes he is the only board-certified plastic surgeon performing such a procedure in the entire country. Other doctors perform similar procedures, but this is not their primary business, he added. He came to the idea after several patients expressed reservations about going completely under – including a woman who was a heavy smoker and wanted such a procedure but outright refused to be asleep. ‘That was my ‘ahah’ moment,’ he recalled, saying that a similar procedure was performed with local anesthesia as far back as the 1960s, but had fallen out of favor as general anesthesia became more reliable. ‘I didn’t invent this, I never pretended to,’ said Dr Gartner. ‘This is kind of probably the way they did it in the 60s or 70s.’ Fully awake: Patients are awake, talkative and fully alert during the entire surgery . Local anesthesia: The area where the surgery is being performed is made numb through injections . He hasn’t looked back since. A patient shown while having a breast augmentation done during a recent profile on Chasing Jersey was alert, talkative and said she felt very little discomfort. She chose Dr Gartner after viewing his prolific series of YouTube videos. ‘I watched a lot of videos on YouTube and I felt confident that this was the right decision,’ said Rachel Saez. She detailed what it was like to have a procedure done while she was awake. ‘I can feel him working on me,’ she said, ‘I can feel him pulling and tugging but it does not hurt.’ Minor discomfort: Despite being cut open, patients report feeling only a tugging sensation as the doctor goes to work . The procedure takes about half an hour and requires less recovery time than conventional surgeries. The patients experience little to no pain, and sidestep the nausea that can be experienced by patients under general anesthesia. Dr Gartner offers pateints the option of general or local anesthesia, and as much as 40 per cent opt for local. Some come from surrounding states for the unique procedure, he noted. ‘It’s a little niche I’ve developed.’","A similar procedure was done as far back as the 1960s .

For Christine Caron there was no greater present this Christmas than being back home with her family after spending more than six months hovering between life and death. The 50-year-old single mother of four from Ottawa, Canada, made headlines in May when she had three of her limbs amputated after experiencing an extreme allergic reaction to a dog bite. The woman went into septic shock and spent six weeks in a coma. When she finally woke up in July, Miss Caron was told by doctors that she would lose an arm and both legs. Scroll down for video . Survivor: Christine Caron, who lost both legs and one of her arms when a rare infection set in after a dog bite, talks about her ordeal at her home . Christmas blessing: Christine Caron (far right) was discharged from the hospital after a triple amputation just in time to celebrate the holidays with her four kids . Puppy love: Caron, 50, is seen surrounded by her Shih Tzu dogs, one of whom nipped her in May, sending her to the hospital with an extreme allergic reaction that nearly cost the woman her life . Caron had spent the past five months in recovery. A few weeks ago, she finally returned home to her family - just in time for her son's birthday and for Christmas. ‘Just to be home and healthy and have my whole family together and that everybody stays that way. I'm so happy I made my 50th year. I mean I just made it clawing,’ Caron told CBC.ca. Christine Caron has been fitted with prosthetic legs and will soon get an artificial arm, which she hopes to put to good use by re-learning to drive a car and jog. Since being discharged from the hospital, the 50-year-old moved her family from their old two-story home to a more easily accessible bungalow in Ottawa’s Beacon Hill North. Caron said that after coming so close to dying, she takes nothing for granted and recognizes beauty in the most mundane things - like snow falling outside her window. The resilient, irrepressible woman also has not lost her sense of humor. Rare infection: Christine Caron, 50, had her legs and arm amputated after she was bitten by her pet dog in Mayin May . Injury: Shih Tzu Buster bit his owner in May which is believed to have caused her terrible illness . ‘Everyone was complaining about having to shovel. Now, granted I didn't have to go out there,’ she quipped. ‘I had an excuse this year.’ For Caron, the nightmare started May 22 when one of her four dogs, a small Shih Tzu named Buster, nipped her hand during a playful tug of war. The woman thought nothing of the tiny nick and let one of her other dogs lick her injured hand - a fateful decision that nearly cost Caron her life. Three days later, Ms Caron felt dizzy. She went to bed that night and woke up only six weeks later at The Ottawa Hospital. As it turned out, the comatose patient went into septic shock after her wound became infected with Capnocytophaga canimorsus - a bacterium common in dogs' saliva. Heavy toll: After going into septic shock and spending six weeks in a medically induced coma, doctors were forced to amputate both of Caron's legs and her left arm . Dark moments: Caron has revealed that she was initially depressed and suicidal, but thinking of her children saved her life . Ms Caron's extreme reaction to the . bacteria left doctors fighting to save her life. The medical team at . Ottawa Hospital were forced to put her into an induced coma for six . weeks. The septic shock . caused blood flow to be restricted to her limbs, turning them black, and . left doctors with no choice but to amputate them. Capnocytophaga canimorsus is common . in the saliva of both dogs and cats. It is normally not seriously . harmful to healthy adults. It . has been estimated that 1million Americans are bitten by dogs every . year with chance of infection from canines varying between 3 and 20 per . cent. Health Canada said in the last 40 years, only 200 people in the world have gone into septic shock for the bacterium. Caron's . reaction could be attributed to that fact she had been unknowingly . battling pneumonia at the time of the incident, which suppressed her . immune system, Ottawa Sun reported. Things could have turned out even worse for the woman: the infection nearly claimed her lips, nose and right hand. Repair: The 50-year-old is due to have skin grafts on her badly injured hand . Fighter: Caron spent months in rehab to learn how to walk - and even dance - on her prosthetic legs . Caron has revealed that after the . amputations, she was depressed and even contemplated suicide, but . focusing on her four children gave her a will to live. What . followed next were months of gruelling physical and occupational therapy . at the Ottawa Hospital Rehabilitation Centre, where Caron worked . tirelessly to regain her strength and learn how to walk on her . prosthetic legs. The 50-year-old has more trials ahead of her: she is awaiting a surgery on her damaged right hand and skin grafting. Since . Caron did not have health insurance to cover her mounting medical . bills, her family have been collecting donations on the site FundRazr to pay for her costly treatment. Since July, the Carons have raised nearly $96,000, and counting.","Christine Caron, 50, from Ottawa, had both her legs and an arm amputated after her pet gave her a small bite in May .

Mr Verzilov was waiting outside a prison in Nizhny Ingash, a remote settlement on the Trans Siberian Railway some 200 km from Krasnoyarsk, when he heard the news. Shortly afterwards he was allowed a to speak to his wife over the phone, he said. 'She is ok.

Ms McDowall, 34, said: 'We were on the way to hospital and in the back of the car I felt I had to push. 'I called the triage at the hospital and told them, and they basically said to stop the car wherever we were and get an ambulance.' Mr Skinner, 44, said: 'We were just starting to drive along and she was shouting out that she thought the baby was coming. 'She was on the phone to the hospital while we were on the way and the next thing I knew she was telling me to stop the car. 'I decided to stop at the Cameron Toll shopping centre as I thought there would be more chance of getting someone there to help. 'I just jumped out of the car and flew into the petrol station and told the guy to get some help. 'I was pretty scared. The next thing I knew a guy came up to me and said he had someone who could help. 'A woman stepped forward and said she was a midwife, she was just getting some petrol, the chances are probably about one in a million.' Ms McDowall said: ""The next thing I knew a lady put her head in the car and said 'I'm a community midwife'. The Cameron Toll petrol station  in Edinburgh where Nicola McDowall  gave birth . 'She helped me to lie down in the back of the car and by this time the baby's head was there. 'She helped deliver him and she really was an angel of mercy. I was pretty scared. I was not sure if the ambulance would get there in time.' The healthy baby boy, who was due last Wednesday, was born at about 9.17pm, around two minutes before an ambulance arrived at the scene. Mother and baby were taken to hospital for checks and were able to return home today. Although the new addition does not yet have a name, the couple say that his middle name will be Cameron after the location of his birth. The as yet unnamed baby, who had an unusual start in life. He was born on a petrol station forecourt . But a big priority is to track down the midwife who helped deliver the baby. Ms McDowall said: 'I did ask her name but with everything else that was going on I've no idea now.' Mr Skinner added: 'We would like to find out who she is to say thank you. We did thank her at the time but she was off pretty quickly. 'It was just really lucky her being there.'","Nicola McDowall gave birth to baby son at Edinburgh petrol station .

The boyfriend of the mother of a five-year-old Massachusetts boy arrested over his September disappearance reported only this month has been denied bail. Alberto Sierra, 22, was denied bail during a Tuesday court appearance to answer charges related to the disappearance of Jeremiah Oliver. Mother Elsa Oliver, 28, was granted bail, but faces a psychiatric evaluation to determine her mental competency. The Fitchburg couple faces multiple felony charges each related to their missing son, who was last seen by family members in September. Christmas Eve in court: Elsa Oliver is escorted into the courtroom Tuesday for her arraignment . Gone missing: Jeremiah hasn't been seen since September . Mr Sierra made no attempt to contest the denial of bail, but all documents and evidence related to the case has been sealed - leaving yet another mystery in the already mysterious disappearance of young Jeremiah. The prosecutors contended he was a danger to society, something backed up by reports of previous domestic violence incidents and claims to MailOnline from a person close to the situation that he previously made violent threats against the family of an ex-girlfriend. The person, who declined to be named for fear of reprisals in the community, confirmed reports Mr Sierra was violent in previous relationships and also spoke of him violating a restraining order. The source also said he would bully and intimidate those around him, routinely becoming irate and even making death threats on more than one occasion. Mr Sierra is not known to have been a heavy drinker or drug user, the person noted. Ms Oliver's bail was set at $100,000. It is not clear if she can reach that amount, but she will have to meet multiple conditions beyond just paying up. Those include wearing a monitoring bracelet on her ankle, resolving a contempt case in juvenile court and working out mental health issues also previously alluded to MailOnline by the source. Is she fit to stand trial?: Ms Oliver is undergoing a psychiatric evaluation to determine her mental competency . 'She doesn't seem to understand what's going on,' Mr Sierra's attorney said of Ms Oliver. 'I've been with her many hours and I can't have a conversation with her.' The attorney described Ms Oliver as having 'a very flat effect,' which is unusual for the mother of a missing boy. She is in the midst of a foresnic psychological evaluation, according to the Worcester Telegram & Gazette, which reported that she faces several charges once it is completed January 10. They include assault with a dangerous weapon (a belt), two counts of reckless endangerment of a child and two counts of being an accessory after the fact of a felony and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. The assault with a belt charges likely stem from earlier reported abuse the child suffered at the hands of both her and Mr Sierra, but officials are remaining tight-lipped about the case. Young Jeremiah is feared dead, and Mr Sierra has been hit with multiple felony charges that come just short of murder. The violent man was arraigned earlier this . month on two counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon . (knife) and two counts of assault and battery on a child causing bodily . injury. Family told officials the last time they saw the young boy was September 14, but the Worcester County District Attorney’s Office was only notified within the last two weeks. Investigators are also canvassing area tattoo parlors about a tattoo the detached mother has of a butterfly and the date Sept. 25, 2013, the Telegram & Gazette reported. They want to know whether she told a tattoo artist why that date is significant. It is not clear why it took three months for authorities to be notified of Jeremiah Oliver’s disappearance. The main suspects: Elsa Oliver (right), 28, and Alberto Sierra (left), 22, have been charged with multiple counts related to the young boy's disappearance . About 30 people attended the court hearing in support of father Jose Oliver - who lives in New Britain, CT. It is not clear how involved he was in the boy's life prior to the disappearance, but he was at Tuesday's hearing. 'The cops are doing a good job,' the devastated father told reporters gathered outside the courthouse. 'Let them do their job. I just want to find my son. That is all.' Edward Valcourt of Worcester, Jose Oliver's cousin, wore a sweatshirt with a picture of the boy he lost saw two years ago. It also had the words 'Prayers for Jeremiah.' 'He was a wonderful little boy, as happy as could be,' said Mr Valcourt. 'It's just awful thinking of him lying somewhere.' 'The first question that should have been asked is where is that little boy,' the family friend added. 'If they don't want to give up the kid they should be tried for murder.' Locals plan to continue searches for the missing boy. 'We're going to keep doing the search until we find him' said Jackie Serrano, of Fitchburg. Her 5-year-old son was in Jeremiah's class. 'That boy doesn't deserve to be like this,' she added. 'That boy deserves to be with his dad for Christmas.' As for the other two children Jose Oliver has with his ex-wife, there is a custody hearing scheduled for December 31. It is not clear if officials believe the boy is still alive. He is about 40 inches tall and weighs about 40 pounds, they said. No further information has been released. Officials urge anyone with information about Jeremiah Oliver to call the numbers on the missing poster.

The cat, called Agata, was unable to deliver her kittens which were stillborn. Lieutenant Balanzoni told the Guardian: 'If the cat had died, the entire area would have had to be disinfected. 'What is more, the surviving kittens could not have been fed. So they too would have died and created an even greater public health problem.'

'It made it easier the more I drank and did drugs,' said the Santa Clara University sophomore. Scroll down for video... In a surprise confessional video posted to YouTube Christmas Eve, the daughter of NYC mayor elect Bill de Blasio confesses to her history of drug and alcohol abuse and depression . Kicked the habit: Chiara says she smoked weed and drank in order to help her with her depression and anxiety in social situations. She says she's since kicked the habits thanks to a treatment program . The revelation comes just a few days before her father is sworn into office January 1, an office Chiara actually helped him win as she campaigned often with her family. 'Removing substances from my life has opened so many doors for me,' Chiara says in the video, her face alight with a big smile. 'I was actually able to participate in my dad's campaign and that was, like, the greatest thing ever.' But, she says, it was a difficult road getting to that point. 'Getting sober is always a positive thing,' Chiara says, but 'it's the hardest thing I've ever done.' Success: Chiara is now clean and sober, she says, and the change has allowed her to work with her father on his successful bid to become New York's first democratic mayor in 20 years . Chiara says it was her therapist who . first referred her to a treatment program, but that her family tried . hard to help even before that. 'My mom was trying really hard to help me, my dad was doing the same,' she says. 'As . parents, our instinct has been to protect our daughter and privately . help her through a deeply personal struggle,' Bill de Blasio and his . wife Chirlane said in a statement.

'Nobody can do sobriety on their own,' she says. 'You have to rely on those who've been there.' If you're 'honest, open and willing,' the politician's daughter says, 'you will see the most immense change you've ever seen.'

A friend of the disgraced PR executive who became globally notorious following a tasteless tweet about AIDs has offered a defense of her - of sorts. Jeff Bercovici said that Justine Sacco clearly made a mistake when she posted a Tweet saying that she hoped she didn't get AIDs during a trip to South Africa, but she was 'still figuring out' Twitter. Bercovici called the move 'a failure of judgment and a poor attempt at expression' in a column for Forbes.com. Scroll down for video . Justine Sacco has no idea her offensive tweet made the news because she is on a flight to Africa . Jeff Bercovici, a friend of fired PR woman Justine Sacco says her tweet was simply an attempt at making a job - albeit a shocking poor one . Sacco posted the offensive Tweet just before getting on a 12-hour flight from London to Cape Town. It caught the attention of reporters during the flight and her company put out a statement before she landed saying that she would no longer be working for IAC. She was on her way to South Africa to visit relatives as her family had lived in the country until 1994 when her father moved them to the United States, which he said- in an ironic twist- to avoid the racism he felt in Cape Town. 'I interpreted it as a self-deprecating joke about white guilt and Western privilege — about the sheepish feeling of being physically close to tragedy while remaining safe in an economic and cultural bubble,' Mr Berkovici wrote. Before being fired, Sacco was the head of corporate communications and had clients that included Match.com, College Humor and About.com. Much of her position at the company involved her dealing directly with reporters. Berkovici writes that she straddled the line of being approachable while professional in her work. Flying into the storm: This photo, snapped by Twitter user Zac_R, was taken as Justine Sacco got off a 12 hour flight at Cape Town airport after arriving from London. The PR representative would have just been discovering the furor her racist Tweet had created while she was in the air . Career suicide: IAC says that they will take 'appropriate action' against the tweet sent by Justine Sacco (pictured above in shots from her Facebook account) with the high powered executive likely to lose her job . Before she took down all of her social . media footprints following the firestorm when she landed in South . Africa, Buzzfeed collected a series of her other offensive tweets, . proving that she was having trouble understanding the potential . backlash. 'Although she'd been using the service for several years, Justine was still figuring out its nuances,' Mr Berkovici said. 'One thing she'd notice was that people seemed to like the tweets that were a little bit risque or outrageous.' One such tweet came on January 30, when she wrote: 'I can't be fired for things I say while intoxicated right?' Another . came more recently, on October 8: 'As I sit and eat a bagel with lox, i . would like to send love to my jews who are all starving themselves . right now. #hungryhungryhebrews'. You most certainly can: This tweet Sacco wrote in January may have been a self fulfilling prophecy . What a mess: Sacco will have some explaining to do for her sloppy behavior on twitter . Sacco, . who is a South African native, issued an apology but not before her own . father greeted her at the airport and said that she was a 'f****** . idiot'. She said she was . sorry 'for being insensitive to this crisis -- which does not . discriminate by race, gender or sexual orientation, but which terrifies . us all uniformly -- and to the millions of people living with the virus, . I am ashamed.' 'Unfortunately, it is terribly easy to be cavalier about an epidemic that one has never witnessed firsthand.' ‘This is my father's country, and I . was born here.

The Manchester City defender has given fans his own special dark Christmas message complete with a rendition of Santa Claus Is Coming To Town that is, you have to say, rather chilling. As a background for the video, he asked for darkness, wolves and the Serbian flag. And then he sung, in a very gruff Serbian accent.

Maybe it was getting his first video game, Cosmic Avenger, for Christmas at the age of 12, and then having to wait an entire year for the hard-to-land Colecovision console to play it on that made Michael Thomasson so determined to get his hands on every video game and system he could find. Now, 31 years and roughly 11,000 games later, Thomasson is the newly crowned world record holder for having the largest collection of video games. He is featured in a two-page spread in the just-released 'Guinness World Records 2014 Gamer's Edition'. 'I have games on cartridge, laser disc. I have VHS-based games, cassette-based games,' Thomasson said, standing among the collection that fills the basement of his suburban Buffalo home. The Guinness Book of World Records verified that Michael Thomasson has the largest collection of videogames in the world as of 2014, with the count being 10,607 at the time. He now says he is approaching 12,000 unique games . Man cave or children's playground? This is a look at the basement where Michael Thomasson (left) keeps his collection . It took counters from the Guiness Book of World Records days to get through Michael Thomasson's games 'archive' Along with the games, he has the devices to play them on, not only the Xboxes and PlayStations but obscure ones like the Casio Loopy, the only game system specifically geared toward girls, which came out in Japan in 1995, and the Pippin, a dud released by Apple the same year. 'Every game on it is awful,' Thomasson says of Apple's foray into the gaming world. 'It's the least fun of anything in the house.' At the other end of the spectrum is the old Colecovision unit like the one that appeared under the Christmas tree one year after his grandparents gave him his first game for it. They had mistakenly believed his parents had gotten their hands on the playing system, which was a hot item that year. It stands to this day as the best present his parents ever gave him. 'It's my first love so it's sentimental,' Thomasson said. But the games also were quality, with very little of the 'shovelware' - mediocre, rushed releases - typical of many systems, he said. 'They looked good, they played good. For the time they sounded good,' he said, 'for the bleeps and blips of the 80s.' Thomasson began collecting almost immediately, he said, but the path to the world record had a couple of restarts. Super Mario Cache: This shelf is specifically for old school Nintendo consoles . Thomasson estimates the collection is worth $700,000 - $800,000 . He sold off his collection twice, first in 1989 to raise money for a Sega Genesis, then again to pay for his 1998 wedding. ('I was heavy into collecting when we married so she knew what she was getting into,' he says of his wife, JoAnn.) Since then, Thomasson has methodically rebuilt the collection, averaging two games per day on a strict $3,000-a-year budget which means never paying full price. He estimates the collection is worth $700,000 to $800,000. He hasn't played every game. The father of a five-year-old, Anna, Thomasson designs games and teaches 2D animation, game design and the history of video games at Canisius College in Buffalo. He also writes on the topic for magazines and books. 'I probably get three hours of playing in a week,' he said. 'If I'm lucky.' Guinness lists the number of games in Thomasson's record-breaking collection at 10,607, though he said the number exceeds 11,000 now, a year after the official count and after discovering forgotten stashes of games after the counting crew left. Either way, it bested the previous record holder, Richard Lecce, who held the record first recorded in 2010 with 8,616 games. 'My congratulations to a fellow collector,' Lecce, 39, said by phone from his Florida home upon hearing his record had fallen. 'It's very impressive and I'm very happy for him.' Lecce began collecting as a way to own all the games he couldn't have as a kid, he said, and grew to appreciate their place in pop culture. Still an active collector, Lecce hasn't counted his games in the last few years and doesn't know what his number has grown to, but he has no immediate plans to challenge Thomasson for his old record. 'It's something I did for my own enjoyment. I applied for the Guinness book for my kids so that years from now they can look back and say, wow, my father was in the `Guinness Book of World Records,' Lecce, a father of two and numismatist, a rare coin dealer, said. He's happy to see more people collecting, and appreciating, video games. 'Everything from the original artwork to the actual code that was written for the games to the actual box art and the whole marketing plan,' he said. 'It's just a very undervalued and underappreciated art form.'","Michael Thomasson has just made the new Guiness World Records 2014 Gamer's Edition for having the largest collection of video games .

Injured passengers had to be airlifted to safety off a ferry after it became stranded in ferocious seas on its way from Portsmouth to Bilbao, witnesses said today.

The scandal which targeted Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's allies has become one of the worst political crises in 10 years . Three Cabinet ministers have resigned in Turkey days after their sons were arrested in a sweeping corruption and bribery scandal. The scandal which targeted Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's allies has become one of the worst political crisis in 10 years. Erdogan Bayraktar, the environment and urban planning minister, announced his resignation in an interview today. It came hours after Economy Minister Zafer Caglayan and Interior Minister Muammer Guler both denied any wrongdoing as they stepped down. Their sons, along with the chief . executive officer of the state-run bank Halkbank, are among 24 people . who have been arrested on bribery charges. Bayraktar's son was detained as part of the corruption probe but later released from custody. Media reports said police have seized $4.5 million in cash that was stashed in shoe boxes in the home of the bank's CEO, while more than 1 million dollars in cash was reportedly discovered in the home of Guler's son, Baris. Erdogan has denounced the corruption probe as a plot by foreign and Turkish forces to thwart his country's growing prosperity and discredit his government ahead of local elections in March. His . government has won three successive elections since 2002 on the . strength of the relatively robust economy, a clean image and a promise . to fight corruption. Turkish commentators believe the probe is fallout from an increasingly public feud and power struggle between Erdogan's government and an influential U.S. based Muslim cleric, Fethullah Gulen, whose followers are believed to have a strong foothold within Turkey's police and judiciary. The two men, without naming each other, have been engaged in a war of words since the corruption probe was launched on December 17. As he resigned on Wednesday, Caglayan questioned the legitimacy of the investigation, which is focusing on alleged illicit money transfers to Iran and alleged bribery for construction projects. 'It is clear that the operation is a dirty conspiracy against our government, our party and our country,' he said in a brief statement. 'I am leaving my position at the economy minister to spoil this ugly plot, which has involved my colleagues and my son, and to allow for the truth to be exposed.' Turkey's Economy Minister Zafer Caglayan, (right) Interior Minister Muammer Guler, (centre) and EU Affairs Minister Egemen Bagis (left) Guler, the interior minister, said that he is the victim of a political plot and that there is nothing his family could not account for. He also said alleged wiretap recordings of a conversation with his son - reportedly used as evidence by police for the arrests- were tampered with, and that the cash discovered in his son's house was money earned from the sale of a luxury villa. The opposition had long called for the two ministers to resign, claiming their sons were taking bribes on behalf of their fathers, and insisted they should not remain in positions where they were able to influence the probe. The government already has dismissed dozens of police officials either involved in the investigation or thought to be linked to Gulen. Journalists have been barred from entering police buildings, fuelling accusations from critics that the government is trying to impede the probe. The investigation is one of the biggest political challenges Erdogan's government has faced, including last summer's nationwide anti-government protests over a development project in a beloved Istanbul park.","The scandal has targeted Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's allies .

Elizabeth Celi-Parr was denied permission to bring Ecuadorian husband Alexander Celi-Moreno to the UK, where she lives with their baby daughter, Olivia, aged 21 months. Mr Celi-Moreno, a doctor, was refused a spouse visa this year, because of new legislation introduced by Home Secretary Theresa May which requires the British partner to have a salary of at least £18,600 a year. Scroll down for video . Elizabeth Celi-Parr said she has received the 'best' Christmas present she could have hoped for after the Home Office reversed a decision, allowing her Ecuadorian husband Alexander Celi-Moreno to move to the UK with her and their baby daughter Olivia . Mrs Celi-Parr recieved the news while on a ferry to Ireland to celebrate Christmas with her husband, who had managed to secure a visa to visit the country . The application was blocked by officials despite the couple being offered jobs with the family firm in Devon, and rent-free accommodation in the spacious family home. Mrs Celi-Parr, frustrated with the time her appeal against the decision was taking, decided to organise a family Christmas reunion in Ireland, where Mr Celi-Moreno had been granted a tourist visa. It was as Mrs Celi-Parr and her daughter Olivia were on a ferry crossing the Irish Sea that she was told her MP, Tory Neil Parish, had won her case. 'It was amazing, the best Christmas present, but I couldn’t tell anyone because I was on a ferry,' said Mrs Celi-Parr, who also celebrated her 30th birthday on Thursday. 'When I eventually found Alexander in the airport wandering around trying to find us, Olivia ran up to him shouting ‘Papa!’ - it was quite emotional.' Mrs Celi-Parr met her 33-year-old husband, in 2006 when she faced problems registering her visa as an English teacher in the Ecuadorian capital of Quito. They married in 2011 and lived in Argentina and Chile. But when baby Olivia arrived, the . couple realised they needed the support of their family and decided to . settle in England, where Mr Celi-Moreno's medical training could lead to . a well-paid job.

Mrs Celi-Parr had assumed her salary, savings and the offer of free accommodation and work would persuade the authorities that the couple were unlikely to become a burden on the state. Nevertheless the request was denied, forcing her to book a trip to Ecuador in the summer, just so that Olivia could see her father. The mother-of-one then also turned campaigner, petitioning her MP and David Cameron to overturn the government decision while helping other families who have been similarly affected in the South West. Mr Celi-Moreno has since received official notification that he must submit his passport to the Ecuadorian visa office, in Brazil, where they will stamp it with permission to live in the UK for two-and-a-half years.

Former talent show winner Matt Cardle was paid £5,000 to switch on Basildon's Christmas lights last month. He also signed a deal believed to be worth £4,000 to switch on the lights in South Ayrshire - but missed his flight up to Scotland because he was 'stuck in traffic'. As a result, he got paid nothing.

He turned the lights on and signed autographs before flying home . Organisers had to scramble in former Britain's Got Talent winner Jai McDowall as a last minute replacement. Fortunately, he had plenty of time on his hands after being ditched by his record label. Councils across the country have blown . £1.8million since the general election in May 2010 hiring celebrities, a . MailOnline investigation under the Freedom of Information Act has . revealed. South Tyneside Council spent £285,600 alone hiring celebrities for free concerts in an effort to give the area a boost over the last three years. Local authorities . have blown taxpayers money to hire stars to turn up at cheesy staff . awards ceremonies, sports centre opening ceremonies and public events. The figures were branded 'astonishing' by critics as they have come at a time when budgets have been slashed. The . total spend could be far higher as 98 out of 434 councils surveyed by . the MailOnline failed to provide a response to the request. Payday: Former X-Factor winner Matt Cardle was paid £5,000 to switch on the Christmas lights in Basildon last month . In Perth, Z-list TOWIE 'star' Mark Wright was given £7,000 plus £132 for flights and £150 for travel - all for just one hour of work. He turned on the Christmas lights but decided he was too 'tired' to meet hundreds of fans who queued outside a restaurant. Instead, his team invited just 30 people at the front of the queue along to the three-star Mercure hotel in Perth where he spent half an hour signing autographs before swiftly flying home. Former Westlife star Brian McFadden - who was famous in the 1990s - was paid £2,500 by Denbighshire Council, in Wales, to perform six songs and turn on the lights. And the crowds in Gravesham, Kent, could be forgiven for asking 'who?' when an unfamiliar face hosted a Festive Cake Bake Event last month. Jo Wheatley, who won the Great British Bake Off in 2011, was paid £1,500 to turn up. Shamed broadcaster Stuart Hall was paid £4,800 to open a white water course in Stockton, Durham. The 83-year-old, who is currently serving a 30-month jail term for sexually abusing 13 girls over a period of nearly 20 years, was arrested months after making his appearance in March 2012. The Queen also attended the event at the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee White Water Course. And in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, Rolf Harris was paid £738 to re-open the Cyfarthfa Castle Museum and Art Gallery. The 83-year-old television entertainer has since been charged with nine counts of indecent assault and four charges of making indecent images of a child. He is due to stand trial next year. Chloe Sims from TOWIE was paid £5,000 and Matthew Wolfenden from Emmerdale received £3,500 to promote road safety. The pair were filmed accelerating on a runway before braking sharply to demonstrate to young drivers just how long it took to stop their car. They were used in a cheesy Valentine's Day Road Safety Campaign and videos of their 'road test' were published on YouTube. Five councils across Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire shared the cost of the project. In a press release put out by Road Safety GB, Matthew Wolfenden was quoted as saying: 'Anyone can drive fast - you stick the pedal to the floor and go. 'The skill is in stopping and your reactions to stopping and to the cars around you.' VIDEO: Chloe Sims and Matthew Wolfenden are paid £8,500 of taxpayers' money to promote road safety . One of the biggest names to be hired was Brian Blessed who attended a walking festival twice - at a cost of more than £11,000 to Isle of Wight Council. In 2010, he was paid £5,967 including expenses to appear at the annual event - and then £5,500 plus £250 expenses to attend the same event this year, . Matthew Sinclair, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said that councils should stop wasting money on minor celebrities. He said: 'This is an astonishing bill for taxpayers to foot. Everyone wants to enjoy Christmas and lights in town centres are often part of the festivities, but that doesn't mean hard-pressed families should have to fork out for minor celebrities to come and switch them on. 'If businesses genuinely believe having Z-listers turn on the lights helps bring shoppers to the area, perhaps they could all stick some money in the kitty themselves. 'Councils are dealing with tighter budgets and have to cut out wasteful spending like this.' A spokesman for Perth and Kinross Council said that hiring Mark Wright from TOWIE got more people to go shopping in the town centre. 'The decision to pay fees to attract a top line-up of entertainment for the Perth Christmas lights festival has been totally vindicated by the overwhelming success of the event,' he said. 'Around 90,000 people visited Perth on Saturday 23 November, with 26,000 in the city centre during the peak hour of 5-6pm when the switch-on took place. 'Not only did we see a 73 per cent increase in footfall for the day compared to last year, but also significantly improved footfall in the days leading up to the event.' Payday: BBC presenter Bill Oddie was paid £5,000 by Surrey County Council to talk about grassland management in 2011 . Payday: The BBC's 'voice of athletics' Paul Dickenson was paid £1,500 to interview David Weir - while the Paralympic star gave up his time for free . A Paralympic hero opened a council sports centre for free - while a BBC commentator was paid £1,500 to interview him at the event. David Weir - who was one of the stars of the 2012 London games - opened the Westcroft Leisure Centre in Sutton, south London for free after it underwent an £11million refurbishment. But while the disabled athlete gave up his time for free, Paul Dickenson, who is known as the BBC's voice of athletics, pocketed a fee to appear on stage at the event in February. David Weir, who is known as the Weirwolf, has won six Paralympic gold medals including four in London last summer. He has also won the London marathon a record-breaking six times after being born with a spinal . condition that left him unable to use his legs. The athlete lives in Sutton and regularly trains at the council's facilities so was happy to give his time up for free. Paul Dickenson on the other hand is a retired hammer-thrower who competed in the Olympics in 1976 and 1980 before joining the BBC after his retirement. As well as commentating on athletics he commentated on the BBC's heavily-criticised coverage of the Diamond Jubilee Thames River Pageant last year. At one point during his commentary, he said: 'Tower Bridge is about as iconic as it gets'. Mr Dickenson, Mr Weir and town mayor Sean Brennan all appeared on stage together at the sports centre opening. A spokesman for Paul Dickenson refused to comment. A spokesman for Sutton London Borough Council said: 'Paul Dickenson hosted the reopening of the Westcroft Leisure Centre in February following a major upgrade which included new sports facilities and a new library. 'His role included being the compere, giving a speech and interviewing David Weir. 'This is the only time in the past three years that we have paid for a celebrity to host an event. 'In this case, the cost was deemed worthwhile because the event promoted the new facilities to a wide audience and encouraged families to lead healthier lives as part of our Olympic legacy ambitions.' A council spent nearly £300,000 hiring celebrities to perform at free concerts in just over three years, figures have revealed. South Tyneside Council paid X-Factor 'stars' Stacey Solomon, Joe McElderry, Little Mix, Gareth Gates, Matt Cardle and Little Mix to appear at the annual event. Critics said the day-long parties are of dubious benefit to the area - at a time when other council-run services are cut back. 'Star': Former X-Factor winner Joe McElderry was among the actors paid to appear at an taxpayer-funded concert put on by a council at a time when other budgets are being cut . The authority has axed 1,200 jobs and been forced to make £48million of savings since 2010 - but the taxpayer-funded knees up has escaped the chop. The council hosts the free Bent Park Sunday Concert each year in an effort to boost tourism. Free concert: Stacey Solomon was paid to appear at the South Tyneside Council at their free annual concert . The authority refused to give a full breakdown of how much each act was paid and claimed it was 'confidential' and 'personal data'. MailOnline explained to them that other councils had released the data in full and had not claimed it could be kept secret. Maurice Frankel, director of the Campaign for Freedom of Information, said: 'For a council in that part of the world to be spending that kind of money is conspicuous. 'They may try and argue that spending that money on concerts will cheer people up. The key issue is accountability for spending public money.' The council spent £54,850 on hiring celebrities in 2010, £48,950 in 2011, £51,000 in 2012 and £130,800 this year. Although they released a full list of names of everyone who was paid to show up - they did not give a breakdown of the fees. A spokesman for the council said: 'The Council stages a hugely popular summer festival, attracting around 100,000 visitors to our borough every year. 'Tourism supports thousands of jobs in South Tyneside, and visitors to our seafront festival spent an estimated £1.3million with local businesses last year alone. 'It would not be appropriate to publish details of the fees paid to individual performers. If the Council published details of a commercial agreement that we have been able to secure at an exceptional rate, it will affect future negotiations and earnings elsewhere for the artists and therefore make performers in general less willing to agree to special deals.'","Z-list TOWIE star Mark Wright paid £7,000 for one hour of work turning on Christmas lights in Perth in November .

Stomach-churning: A selection of indigestible items that have been swallowed by Albatrosses and plucked from the decaying carcasses of their chicks . Wandering albatross have the record for the bird with the largest wingspan at 3.5 metres. Distances are hard to measure, but one banded bird was recorded travelling 6000 km in twelve days. They spend most of their life on the wing, returning to land only to court a mate and to breed. The female Albatross lays just one egg that can weigh 1.2lb  (0.5kg), in a basic nest on the ground. The parents take it in turns to incubate the egg for 2-3 months depending on the size of the Albatross species. Chicks can take anywhere from 5 to 10 months to fledge, depending on the size of the Albatross species. Albatross are very long living Birds with an average age of between 40 and 50 years old. The images show the items albatrosses are swallowing on a daily basis, including toothbrushes, golf balls and plastic action figures. They eat the plastic objects, which are typically attached to fish eggs floating in the sea. In the past, the eggs were attached to pieces of wood or seaweed, which the albatross would either digest of break into smaller bits. They also eat items they think resemble . natural prey such as a fish, squid or large crustaceans, which make up . their normal diet.

There is also a 4m-long galley bathroom - complete with a full-sized shower, sink and toilet which uses a composting toilet. A fully functional kitchen with hob, fridge freezer, combination microwave oven. A dining table which can be stowed to make room for a four-seater sofa. A two-seater sofa and two ottomans that can be reconfigured for 4-person dining/sitting or two-person lounging. Low-energy lighting and appliances (including a TV and washing machine) Mechanical heat-recovery ventilation. Very efficient heating and hot water using an optional air-source heat pump. Solar panels on the roof providing power to LED lighting. Despite the cube’s compact dimensions it crams in a lounge, spiral staircase, kitchen, full-size bathroom and bedroom which are spread over three floors. It achieves this through ingenious internal design, such as a bookcase that doubles as a mini spiral staircase. The QB2 will go on the market early next year and range between £10,500 to £45,000. It does not require planning permission because it is under 13ft (4m) in height. Dr Page said: 'The QB2 is practical and fits together easily. If someone can put up an Ikea Billy bookcase then they can put this up. 'It goes together like flat-pack furniture, although when a customer buys it they will get the finished product and won’t have to put it together themselves. 'It takes around four hours to put . the cube together, however it would obviously take longer when you add . I’m the furniture, it depends how quickly you work. 'Most of the furniture inside is from Ikea, which I guess does coincidentally link in with how easy the QB2 is to put together. 'Inside . the QB2 there is a lot of practicability, with things such as the . dining table being able to move while still attached to the wall, giving . more room to move around and also lounge on the sofa. 'The QB2 has everything a normal home . has, except it is all scaled down, however, there is still enough room . for people, with a double bed as an available feature.' The house is as easy to build as 'an Ikea Billy bookcase'. It features a scaled-down, fully-functioning bathroom . He added: 'It is quick to put up too, we can build the shell in under four hours, although obviously it would take us longer to add everything in, including the kitchen. 'I think it is great, of course I would say that, but I really do think it is and it is the only one in the world.' The building starts at £9,495 to build yourself or £10,305.00 for Bolton Buildings to erect it for youthe basic option includes foundations, floor joists, ceiling joists and wall studs. The second option costs between £22,839 and £27,208 and adds insulation to . walls, floor and ceiling, roof covering and internal birch lining to walls. Cosy: The QB2 costs between £10,000 and £45,000. The dining table (pictured) can be stowed to make room for a four-seater sofa . Cutting red tape: The structure does not require planning permission because it is under 4m in height . The deluxe package costs up to £47,200 and Includes a . shower, furniture, LED TV, kitchen appliances, bed and mattress, . lights, switches, wiring, plumbing, triple-glazed windows, chesnut . cladding, cork tile flooring, and is fully painted throughout. The QB2 made its TV debut on George Clarke’s Amazing Spaces on Channel 4 last week. Because of the small dimensions, the structure has the same planning status of a static caravan. Dr Page, who teaches at the University of Hertfordshire, decided to make the cube in order to teach people how they could help the environment. Lead by example: Dr Page decided to make the cube in order to teach people how they could help the environment . He said: 'I used to be an engineer and I was looking to encourage people to be greener and make pro-environmental changes. 'I thought instead of telling people, I could show them. 'For example, if someone tells you that an LED light is better and explains why, you’ll probably go home and not do anything about it. 'However, when people would say ""how is it better, and show me how"", I could, all I had to do was flick a switch, it started as a way of encouraging people they could do what I have done.'

Tom Cruise has started the holiday season in style - by taking his seven-year-old daughter Suri to Disney World. The A list star, 51, has been spotted at the resort in Orlando, Florida - while his son Connor tweeted his joy at joining his family, writing: 'Disney World!!!!!!!!' Cruise is believed to be spending Christmas with Suri after his ex-wife, actress Katie Holmes took the little girl back to her hometown of Toledo, Ohio, for Thanksgiving. Finally over: Tom Cruise has reached a confidential settlement with Bauer Publishing . Daddy's little princess: Tom Cruise whisked daughter Suri off to Disney World in Florida in July 2012 - where she dressed up as The Little Mermaid . Cruise was spotted at the theme park just days after reaching a settlement in his $50million lawsuit against the publisher of both Life & Style and In Touch magazine. Holidaymaker Sydney Rae Davis tweeted yesterday: 'In Disney World, just had the best dinner of my life, And I'm in the same building as Tom Cruise. It's a GOOD day.' Cruise is a familiar face at Disney World. He was pictured enjoying a break with Suri - dressed as Ariel from The Little Mermaid - in August 2012. The pair were seen at a water park and for the best part of Suri's adventure, she got to stay in one of Disney's most coveted rooms, Cinderella's Castle Suite. Daddy daughter time: Tom Cruise launched a $50m action against Bauer Publishing insisting he had not abandoned daughter Suri following his split from Katie Holmes in 2012 . The room cannot be booked at any price, but it's often used by Disney for charity events and promotions. Four stories above the Magic Kingdom sits Cinderella's Castle Suite, which is decorated as a 17th-century chamber, with a sitting room, bedchamber and bathroom off a private marble-floored foyer, reported People. Staying in the suite includes access to a 24-hour concierge, ready to make your wish his command. Originally conceived as an apartment for Walt Disney and his family to stay in while in Florida (unfortunately, Walt died in 1966, five years before Disney World opened), two queen-sized beds and a pullout couch can accommodate up to six people. While Connor, now 18 and a DJ, joined his father and sister, it's unclear where his older sister Isabella is. Isabella, who celebrated her 21st birthday on Sunday, has been living in London. Both Connor and Isabella were adopted by Cruise and his ex-wife Nicole Kidman. It's thought Cruise and Connor will join family at his 210-acre, mulit-million dollar ranch in Telluride, Colorado, for the rest of the holidays. For Cruise, it will be time to reflect and relax after he sued Bauer Publishing over a pair of stories that suggested he had abandoned Suri after divorcing Katie Holmes in 2012. However, in a statement on Friday, the . publisher of the two tabloid magazines said it never intended to imply . that the star had abandoned his daughter. The . statement from Bauer Publishing accompanied news that Cruise . and the tabloids had reached a confidential settlement in a defamation . case filed by the Mission Impossible star. A rep for Cruise confirmed with MailOnline that the lawsuit had reached a private settlement. His lawyer, Bert Fields, called the stories outrageous and said that Cruise spoke to his daughter frequently while working on a pair of movie shoots that kept him overseas.

Allegations: Cruise's lawsuit claimed that Life And Style and In Touch had misrepresented his relationship to his daughter, pictured in New York on Friday .

Making a splash; Suri Cruise comes flying down a water slide at Disney World water park - while her dad looks on . The magazines' statements said they . regret if anyone interpreted their stories as meaning Cruise had cut all . contact to his daughter. The defendants stated: 'Bauer Publishing, In Touch and Life & Style . never intended to communicate that Tom Cruise had cut off all ties and . abandoned his daughter Suri and regret if anyone drew that inference . from anything they published.' Cruise's attorney Fields previously told The Hollywood Reporter: 'Tom doesn't go around suing people. 'He's not a litigious guy. But when . these sleaze peddlers try to make money with disgusting lies about his . relationship with his child, you bet he's going to sue.' But in bringing suit against Bauer, . Cruise had to be willing to make public many private aspects of his . personal life, including details regarding his role in the Church Of . Scientology. Nonetheless, Fields said over the summer to THR: 'Tom is going to want to push this one all the way.' The private settlement of the lawsuit comes after MailOnline reported last month that Bauer Publishing was considering subpoenaing Tom's ex-wife Holmes. Katie, 34, could have been called upon to speak in the deposition about her marriage and subsequent divorce to Tom. The questioning no doubt would have led to whether Katie believes that Tom 'abandoned' their seven-year-old daughter Suri following the divorce - which is what both Bauer titles Life&Style and InTouch had claimed. Sources close to the actress had already informed MailOnline that Katie would have been 'happy' to get the chance to speak 'freely about their marriage and split'. Katie was said to be a practitioner of the church throughout their five-year marriage but left along with Suri as soon as she split with Tom.

Spotted: Holidaymaker Sydney Rae Davis saw A list star Cruise at Disney World . Close: Connor and Isabella Cruise are close - and Connor often visits Bella, who now lives in London . During a heated exchange last September between the actor and the magazineâ€™s lawyers he was asked if Holmes had divorced him 'in part to protect Suri from Scientology'. 'Listen, I find that question offensive,' he said. 'I find it, those statements offensive. Like with any relationship, there are many different levels to it. You know, I, I find it very offensive. There is no need to protect my daughter from my religion.' Radar also reported that Katie is said to have signed a confidentiality agreement with Tom as part of their split.","Star last week reached settlement in $50m defamation lawsuit against Bauer publishing .

The dog escaped without injury after being rescued from the water by members of the public. The man is the sixth victim of the extreme weather which has swept Britain over the past two days, after two others drowned and three people died in crashes. Accident: A man has died after trying to rescue his dog from a river in Newton Abbot, Devon while his family were shopping in a nearby branch of Asda . The man had apparently been visiting Asda with his family and their three pet dogs when one of the animals went in to the River Lemon near the store. Witnesses called 999 after seeing him in difficulty in the river. He was found by police some distance downstream of the site where he entered the water, and flown to the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital. The man was fighting for life for several hours, but lost his battle this afternoon. No other family members were hurt in the incident, while all three dogs were unharmed. A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police said: 'The man has been pronounced dead at hospital. His next-of-kin are aware.' Tragedy: The south-west of England has been one of the worst-affected parts of Britain during this week's storms and flooding . South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust said the man had suffered 'serious' injuries in the incident. The south-west of England has been particularly badly affected by the storms and flooding which started yesterday and continued into this morning. Many rivers are believed to have swollen by the heavy rainfall, leading police to urge members of the public to stay away from fast-flowing bodies of water. In the wake of the storms, a man died in Cumbria yesterday when he fell into the River Rothay at Ambleside while a woman was pulled out of the water dead at Nant Ffrancon, Bethesda, Wales.

A teenager says having her ears pierced could have saved her life after she went on to discover cancerous lumps in her neck. Chloe Carter, 13, had the studs fitted as a birthday present and found the growths just days later. The teenager, who lives in Sampford Peverell, Devon, was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma, a type of blood cell cancer on Friday, December 6. Chloe Carter, 13, was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma after finding ball-like lumps on her neck while playing with her newly pierced ears at school . She said: ‘For my birthday, which was at the end of October, I was allowed my ears pierced. ‘A few days later I was in a science lesson and I noticed weird little ball-like lumps on my neck. ‘I said to my friends and they said it could just be a muscle or something so I didn't tell my mum. ‘Then it came up even worse so I eventually said to her a couple of days later and she took me to the doctors.’ Chloe’s mother, Sue, said: ‘At first I thought it was an infection from having the piercing. I never thought it would be anything else.’ Initially doctors thought the same but as time passed more lumps appeared and Chloe was sent for a series of tests. Initially Chloe's parents, Sue and Phil, thought the lumps on her neck were caused by an infection resulting from her newly pierced ears . Her father, Phil, said: ‘We got a phone call two days later asking us to come in the following morning and I asked whether Chloe would need treatment and they said yes, so I knew then it wasn't good news.’ After arriving at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital the family were told she had a form of cancer known as Hodgkin's lymphoma. ‘I had never heard of it before in my life,’ said Chloe, who also has an older half-brother Ryan, 20, and younger sister Lily, 9. Doctors explained that the form of the disease affects the lymph nodes, which are found throughout the body but the most common place for it to start is in the neck and then in the chest, under the arms and in the groin. Mr Carter said: ‘All the doctors were very reassuring.’ When Chloe told her friend she had cancer and would need chemotherapy, they agreed to have their hair cut short with her. The group are pictured before their hair cuts with Chloe in the middle . Chloe was sent for a series of scans including an MRI, an ultrasound and a heart scan. The teenager started chemotherapy on December 17 and will receive treatment every day until Christmas Eve, when her first course will be complete. She will continue the next round of treatment after Christmas. Mr Carter said: ‘After her treatment she will have to go back every three months for check-ups so she will be cared for for many years to come.’ To support their friend, a group of girls from Chloe's class organised to have their hair cut short when she had her head shaved on Sunday. Chloe (pictured with her friends after their hair cuts) has now started chemotherapy . Her mother said: ‘Chloe went into school on the Monday, after finding out on the Friday, and asked to take a group of 10 friends to one side to tell them what happened. ‘She was really brave and the school was really supportive and I think she became a lot stronger after that. Her friends were absolutely fantastic and now five of them are going to cut their hair, which will be donated to the Prince’s Trust.’ Just a few days later Chloe, with the help of one of her father’s friends, set up her own fundraising page on Facebook, which already has almost 1,000 likes, to raise money for CLIC Sargent and Paediatric Oncology Exeter. She said: ‘Once I told people they started coming up with loads of different ideas. We're having a 24 hour dance in January and a bake sale in school.’ Chloe's mother, Sue, said: 'At first we were just numb and it was hard to be normal. It's been the hardest ever Christmas. We tried to do some shopping on Friday but I just felt like a zombie' Mr Carter added: ‘Some of the girls want to do a swim at the leisure centre and the distance will be roughly how far it is from our house to the hospital, which is about 18 miles, between them. ‘The men are also having a head shave and wax in February.’ Chloe’s mother said: ‘At first we were just numb and it was hard to be normal. It's been the hardest ever Christmas. We tried to do some shopping on Friday but I just felt like a zombie and it's the hardest time for this to happen because it's about kids.’ Mr Carter added: ‘We would like to thank the GP's at Clare House Surgery in Newport Street whose prompt action led us to the paediatric oncology team for treatment, who have been so supportive in every aspect of the treatment.’ If you would like to donate to Chloe's Teenage Cancer Trust visit facebook.com/ChloesTeenageCancerTrust . Hodgkin's lymphoma is cancer of the B lymphocytes - a type of white blood cell found in the lymphatic system. In people with lymphoma, the lymphocytes - infection fighting white blood cells - start to multiply abnormally. They also lose their infection-fighting properties making the sufferer more prone to infection. The most common first symptom of Hodgkin's lymphoma is a painless swelling in a lymph node - usually in the neck, armpit or groin. Other possible symptoms include unexplained tiredness, nigh sweats, fever, weight loss and a persistent cough. The condition is most common in people between the ages of 15 and 35 and in the over 50s. More men than women are affected and nearly 1,500 people are diagnosed in the UK each year. It is a fairly aggressive cancer than can spread quickly through the body. However, it is one of the most easily treated cancers. Almost all young people with the disease will be fully cured. For older people, the cure rare is 75 to 80 per cent. Source: NHS Choices .","Chloe Carter, 13, found ball-like lumps on her neck while at school .

Samantha Cameron’s aristocratic relatives have been urged to end a bitter family legal feud that is ‘haemorrhaging money’. John Sheffield, the Prime Minister’s wife’s second cousin, had sued his 74-year-old father in the High Court over land given to him by his grandfather. Judge Mark Pelling QC found in favour of Old Etonian Mr Sheffield but urged the warring family ‘whether it might be possible, even at this very late stage, to resolve what remains of this dispute by mediation or negotiation, rather than by further litigation’. He added: ‘The costs are completely out of control... this case is haemorrhaging money.’ Wrangle: John Sheffield, 50, left, won a case against his family trustees, including his father Julian, 74, right, which entitles him to 25 years of income from a proportion of an estate in Hampshire . Mr Sheffield, 50, was given a 25 per . cent stake in his family’s 1,000 acre Hampshire estate in 1983 by his . grandfather, John Vincent Sheffield. But he says he was deprived of his share of income until his grandfather died in 2008 aged 95. He sued his father Julian in an attempt to recover money from rent, farm yields and shooting fees covering 25 years. Last . month the High Court heard that the grandfather – youngest son of Sir . Berkeley Sheffield, the sixth baronet of Normanby – had rescued the . family fortunes after the Sheffields were threatened by crippling death . duties following the Second World War. He established the estate at Laverstoke, near Basingstoke, in 1968. It was his fervent wish that his son Julian and subsequent heirs would maintain the estate. After . being advised he could save on Capital Transfer Tax by making lifetime . gifts to his heirs, he signed documents in 1983 that handed a quarter of . the income from the land to his grandson, then 19. Legacy: John Sheffield, left, died in 2008 aged 95 after spending his life worrying about 'ruinous taxation. He is the great uncle of Samantha Cameron, right . The . younger John Sheffield was then in his second year at university and . did not read the documents properly before he signed them. He . was led to believe that he would not see any real financial benefit . until his grandfather passed away, said Judge Pelling. It was only in . 2004 that he found out about his income rights. By this time John Sheffield was bitterly estranged from his father and other members of the family. The . earlier hearing was told that he believed his parents were responsible . for physical abuse he believes he suffered at the hands of one of his . nannies. The amount being . claimed by Mr Sheffield, who like Mrs Cameron is a great-grandchild of . Sir Berkeley Sheffield, has not been disclosed. Judge . Pelling has now found in his favour, saying that there ‘could be no . real doubt’ the true effect of the gift had been deliberately concealed . from him and that he had been entitled to 25 per cent of the estate’s . net income since the day the documents were signed. The former chairman of bank note paper manufacturers Portals established a 1,000-acre farming estate in Hampshire (pictured) His grandfather, by retaining all the income, had acted in breach of trust. The . evidence that Mr Sheffield had been kept in the dark ‘could not be . starker’, the judge said. ‘The reality is that the information that was . withheld from him was information that his grandfather ought to have . disclosed.’ Julian . Sheffield and the other estate trustees had argued that there had been . ‘an informal arrangement’ that John would get no income from the estate . until after the grandfather’s death. But . Judge Pelling said in his ruling that, if that were so, the 1983 gift . to John was ‘a sham in its classical sense’ and would have achieved . nothing apart from the tax saving that the grandfather was so . desperately hoping for.","John Sheffield, 50, took his family to court over missed earnings .

Astronauts removed an old space station pump today, sailing through the first of a series of urgent repair spacewalks to revive a crippled cooling line. The two Americans on the crew, Rick Mastracchio and Michael Hopkins, successfully pulled out the ammonia pump with a bad valve -- well ahead of schedule. That task had been planned for the next spacewalk on Monday. 'An early Christmas,'observed Mission Control as Mastracchio tugged the refrigerator-size pump away from its nesting spot. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The spacewalk by the two American astronauts over the weekend went faster than planned and appeared to go off without a hitch . Mission: One of the astronauts can be seen working on the broken pump . If Mastracchio and Hopkins keep up the quick work, two spacewalks may be enough to complete the installation of a spare pump and a third spacewalk will not be needed on Christmas Day as originally anticipated. The breakdown 10 days earlier left one of two identical cooling loops too cold and forced the astronauts to turn off all nonessential equipment inside the orbiting lab, bringing scientific research to a near-halt and leaving the station in a vulnerable state. Mission Control wanted to keep the spacewalkers out even longer Saturday to get even further ahead, but a cold and uncomfortable Mastracchio requested to go back. The spacewalk ended after 5 1/2 hours, an hour short on time but satisfyingly long on content. Earlier, Mastracchio managed to unhook all the ammonia fluid and electrical lines on the pump with relative ease, occasionally releasing a flurry of frozen ammonia flakes that brushed against his suit. A small O-ring floated away, but he managed to retrieve it. 'I got it, I got it, I got it. Barely,' Mastracchio said as he stretched out his hand. 'Don't let that go, that's a stocking stuffer,' Mission Control replied. Faced with unexpected repairs due to an equipment breakdown at the orbiting lab on December 11, Nasa arranged makeshift snorkels inside the 35-year-old spacesuits . Rather than allow Mastracchio, 53, to wear that suit again, astronauts are planning to work on resizing a spare spacesuit aboard the ISS for him on his next spacewalk to complete the ammonia pump module replacement . Ready to go: Crew member Rick Mastracchio, left, examines his spacesuit aboard the station . 'Don't tell my wife,' Mastracchio said, chuckling, as he put it in a small pouch for trash.Mastracchio, a seven-time spacewalker, and Hopkins, making his first, wore extra safety gear as they worked outside. NASA wanted to prevent a recurrence of the helmet flooding that nearly drowned an astronaut last summer, so Saturday's spacewalkers had snorkels in their suits and water-absorbent pads in their helmets.To everyone's relief, the spacewalkers remained dry. But midway through the excursion, Mastracchio's toes were so cold that he had to crank up the heat in his boots. Mission Control worried aloud whether it was wise to extend the spacewalk to get ahead, given Mastracchio's discomfort. Not quite two hours later, Mastracchio had enough as he clutched the old pump. When Mission Control suggested even more get-ahead chores, he replied, ""I'd like to stow this old module and kind of clean up and call it a day."" He said a couple of things were bothering him, not just temperature, and declined to elaborate when asked by Mission Control what was wrong. Flight controllers obliged him. Once the old pump was secured to a temporary location, the spacewalkers started gathering up their tools to go in.Adding to the excitement 260 miles up, a smoke alarm went off in the space station as the astronauts toiled outside. It was quickly found to be a false alarm. The pump replacement is a huge undertaking attempted only once before, back in 2010 on this very unit. The two astronauts who tackled the job three years ago were in Mission Control, offering guidance. Mastracchio promised to bring back a wire tie installed on the pump by the previous spacewalkers. 'Oh, awesome, thanks Rick,' replied the astronaut in Mission Control who put it on.The 780-pound pump is about the size of a double-door refrigerator and extremely cumbersome to handle, with plumbing full of toxic ammonia. Any traces of ammonia on the spacesuits were dissipated before the astronauts went back inside, to avoid further contamination.NASA's plan initially called for the pump to be disconnected Saturday, pulled out Monday and a fresh spare put in, and then all the hookups of the new pump completed Wednesday in what would be the first Christmas spacewalk ever. But if the work is finished Monday, a third spacewalk will be unnecessary and most everybody on the team will have the holiday off. Mission: Staff in Houston monitored the crew's progress . In the days following the Dec. 11 breakdown, flight controllers attempted in vain to fix the bad valve through remote commanding. Then they tried using a different valve to regulate the temperature of the overly cold loop, with some success. But last Tuesday, NASA decided the situation was severe enough to press ahead with the spacewalks. Although the astronauts were safe and comfortable, NASA did not want to risk another failure and a potential loss of the entire cooling system, needed to radiate the heat generated by on-board equipment. NASA delayed a delivery mission from Wallops Island, Va., to accommodate the spacewalks. That flight by Orbital Sciences Corp., which should have occurred this past week, is now targeted for Jan. 7. Until Saturday, U.S. spacewalks had been on hold since July, when an Italian astronaut's helmet was flooded with water from the cooling system of his suit. Luca Parmitano barely got back inside alive. Engineers traced the problem to a device in the suit that turned out to be contaminated - how and why, no one yet knows. For Saturday's spacewalk, Hopkins wore Parmitano's suit, albeit with newly installed and thoroughly tested components. Just in case, NASA had Mastracchio and Hopkins build snorkels out of plastic tubing from their suits, before going out. The snorkels will be used in case water starts building up in their helmets. They also put absorbent pads in their helmets; the pads were launched from Earth following the July scare. Besides the two Americans, three Russian and one Japanese astronaut are living on the space station, all men.","Two American crew members named Rick Mastrachhio and Michael Hopkins made an urgent repair to the cooling system .

The number of homes worth  £1million or more has jumped by a third over the past year alone, fuelled by soaring house prices in London and the South East. A report found that 255 homeowners have been promoted to the exclusive club every day. Pricey: The total number of homes valued at £1 million plus by Zoopla this month has grown by almost one third compared with a year ago to reach 393,127. Homes around Hampstead Heath in North London are pictured . But the rise means that, in some . areas, young couples looking to move from a flat to a house to start a . family are forced to take on crippling mortgages.

Cap: Drivers are paying £200m a year too much for insurance because of accident bills, an investigation has shown . Car accident costs, such as carrying out repairs and providing a replacement vehicle, could be capped to crack down on rip-offs. The Competition Commission said yesterday that drivers are being overcharged some £200 million a year on motor insurance because accident costs are out of control. It is also concerned that repairs carried out following accidents may be shoddy and even dangerous. Concerns were revealed in the provisional findings of a Commission investigation, which concluded the motor insurance market ‘is not working well for motorists’. The inquiry also raised questions about the cosy relationship between insurers and price comparison website, who take commission to recommend deals. The websites often make insurers sign contracts that promise not to offer cheaper premiums via rival websites with the result there is no meaningful competition. The main problems and exaggerated costs surround drivers whose cars are damaged by other road users through no fault of their own. Generally, their own insurer will supply an expensive replacement vehicle and arrange for repairs, which can take a long time and are often expensive. These costs are then passed on to the insurer of the driver who was at fault and end up putting up insurance premiums for everyone on the road. Commission chiefs have outlined a series of measures which it may implement to make the cost of dealing with accidents cheaper and so bring down the cost of motor premiums. These include making a driver’s own insurer responsible for providing a replacement vehicle, plus caps on the costs of providing a temporary replacement and repairs. It is also looking at whether it is necessary to carry out compulsory audits on the quality of repairs offered by garages. The Commission said measures may be necessary to ensure there is genuine competition to offer the cheapest premium on price comparison websites. Deputy chairman of the Commission, Alasdair Smith, who is leading the motor insurance investigation, said: ‘Our provisional view is that many drivers of the UK’s 25 million privately registered cars are footing the bill for unnecessary costs incurred during the claims process following an accident. These costs are initially borne by the insurers of at-fault drivers, but they feed through into increased car insurance premiums for all drivers. Relations: The inquiry also raised questions about the relationship between car insurers and price comparison websites (library image) ‘There is insufficient incentive for insurers to keep costs down even though they are themselves on the receiving end of the problem.’ He added: ‘We have concerns about the quality of post-accident repairs because too many repairs are substandard. ‘Price comparison websites lead to increased competition to the benefit of motorists, but clauses requiring the same price to be offered for an insurer’s product across the market reduce competition.’ The investigation has not considered the impact of personal injury claims on premiums, which has been a scandal in its own right. Britain became the whiplash capital of Europe in the last decade with lawyers and claims firms generating huge bills, often for bogus claims. The government has made efforts to tackle this abuse by banning ambulance-chased lawyers from paying referral fees to people and organisations who provide details of accident victims. The ban came into effect in April, however it is unclear if it is working. The Association of British Insurers welcomed the Commission’s efforts to cut down on costs, but it said some of the findings were based on flawed research. Head of motor at the ABI, James Dalton, said ‘Today’s possible remedies are a further step along the road to getting a market that enables insurers to deliver fully for consumers.’ He said that ‘excessive costs’ in dealing with accidents had been passed on to drivers for too long. ‘We welcome the provisional remedies which could give the at-fault insurer greater control over the claim they are paying for and reduce the overall cost of providing replacement vehicles to customers,’ he said. Mr Dalton also welcomed efforts to stop price comparison websites from limiting competition on premiums. However, he said the commission’s concerns about shoddy vehicle repairs and the need for quality audits were based on a flawed inspection report which looked a very small number of cases.","Drivers are being overcharged some £200m a year on motor insurance .

It may seem a far-fetched idea nowadays even when it feels bitterly cold outside, but the River Thames has frozen over at least 23 times since the 1300s. The last occurrence was two centuries ago in 1814, but in the past a number of festivals known as the River Thames Frost Fairs sprang up on the river. The period from the mid-14th century to the 19th century in Europe was referred to as the ‘Little Ice Age’ due to the severity of the climate at the time. Winters of old: This 1684 oil on canvas painting called 'A Frost Fair on the Thames at Temple Stairs' shows booths, coaches, sledges, sedan-chairs and groups of people . Tents: A colour aquatint showing a frost fair, entitled 'View of the Thames off Three Cranes Wharf when frozen Monday 31st January to Saturday 5th February 1814' Impression: This caricature by George Cruikshank and Thomas Tegg is based on the 1814 fair, with people playing skittles and slipping over. A tent selling alcohol says: 'Gin and Gingerbread Sold here wholesale' and a woman near the bridge has a stall selling hot food, with the slogan: 'Here's my smoking Hot Sasengers a penney a peic' Paintings and memorabilia owned by the Museum of London show that when the conditions were right, Londoners headed onto the river in celebration. The first recorded frost fair did not take place until 1608, although the Thames had frozen over several times in the 16th century. It is said that Henry VIII travelled all the way from Central London to Greenwich by sleigh along the river during the winter of 1536. Elizabeth I is also thought to have taken walks on the ice during the winter of 1564. Centuries later, the last frost fair was held on the Thames in 1814. It took place from February 1 to 5, and the ice was so thick at the time that an elephant crossing was held at Blackfriars. Meriel Jeater, the museum’s curator of . archaeological collections, told MailOnline: ‘The Thames is first . recorded as freezing over in the 12th century. ‘The . first time people took to the frozen river for organised entertainments . was 1309, where a hare was hunted with dogs (and) a fire was built on . the ice.

A souvenir tankard from the frost fair of 1683 is pictured (right) ‘Between 1309 . and 1814, the surface of the Thames froze over at least 23 times in the . London area. One of the main reasons for this was not due to colder . temperatures, as some may think. 'The Thames never froze over in the London area again (after 1831) - despite temperatures dropping to -20C at times in the notoriously cold winter of 1895' Meriel Jeater, Museum of London . She . added: ‘It was actually to do with the structure of Old London Bridge . at the time. It had 19 arches and each of the 20 piers was supported by . large breakwaters called ""starlings"". ‘When . chunks of ice got caught between them, it slowed the flow of the river . above the bridge, making it more likely to freeze over. When New London . Bridge opened in 1831 it only had five arches. 'Once . this structure was in place, the Thames never froze over in the London . area again - despite temperatures dropping to -20C at times in the . notoriously cold winter of 1895.’ Weeks of hard frosts led to the Thames . being frozen, with traders sensing a chance to sell souvenirs - and dozens of shops put in place overnight.

A woman arrested on suspicion of murdering her three-year-old granddaughter was previously investigated for child abuse, according to police records. Carida ‘Charity’ Cobb, 41, from Tampa, Florida, was arrested on Friday on charges of first-degree murder and aggravated child abuse following the death of Yanelli Vasquez on December 13. Cobb was previously investigated and subsequently cleared of assaulting Yanelli’s two-year-old brother, according to a report from the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s office. Accused: Carida Cobb (left) has been arrested in connection with the murder of Yanelli Vasquez (right) Released on Monday, it states that in April 2012, Cobb allegedly ‘beat the c*** out of’ Yanelli’s brother simply because he burst into tears. But detectives closed the investigation because Mrs Cobb denied the allegation and no suspicious injuries were found on the child, The Tampa Bay Times reports. Meanwhile, Cobb claims that Yanelli was killed after she fell on top of her at bath time. Investigation: Cobb was arrested after suspicious bruises were found on Yanelli . However, highly suspicious bruises were found on Yanelli's back and forehead and she'd suffered internal bleeding, so Cobb was arrested. Paramedics had arrived at the house they lived in to find Cobb straddling Yanelli and shaking her, apparently in a bid to revive her. Yanelli was put in her grandmother's care after the mother, Maria Vasquez, 27, was found to have a drug habit – she’d tested positive for cocaine, marijuana, ecstasy, oxycodone and methamphetamine - and because of reports of violence in the family.","Carida 'Charity' Cobb, 41, from Tampa was arrested for first-degree murder .

Irish bookmaker Paddy Power has withdrawn its sponsorship of retired US basketball player Dennis Rodman's visits to North Korea, saying it was a result of general condemnation of Pyongyang. Rodman returned on Monday from a four-day trip to isolated North Korea that was arranged by Paddy Power and followed the rare public purge of leader Kim Jong Un's powerful uncle Jang Song Thaek, who was executed this month. 'It was really a reaction to the worldwide focus and total condemnation of the North Korean regime over recent events,' the betting firm, which is renowned for its daring marketing, said in a statement.

A lawyer for an Indian diplomat whose arrest and strip search in New York City drew angry responses from officials in India accused U.S. authorities of bungling the investigation. On Tuesday attorney Daniel Arshack said the agent who drew up charges against his client made a key error in reading a form submitted on behalf of a domestic worker for Devyani Khobragade, India's deputy consul general in New York. She was arrested two weeks ago and charged with submitting false documents to obtain a work visa for her New York City housekeeper. 'Mistake': Devyani Khobragade's lawyer claims that officials made an error while reviewing a work visa form she'd submitted for her New York maid . Arshack said in an email that the error . was in ‘erroneously and disastrously’ mistaking Khobragade's listed base . salary of $4,500 per month for what she intended to pay her . housekeeper. The lawyer said Khobragade's salary . needed to be listed on the form so that U.S. embassy officials in India . would know that Khobragade had sufficient income to be able to pay her . housekeeper $1,560 per month, or $9.75 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. In court documents, authorities claim she paid her housekeeper about . $3.31 per hour. In an . interview, Arshack said it became apparent as he and others closely . reviewed the forms Khobragade was required to submit to arrange for the . hiring of her housekeeper that the information she had submitted had . been misunderstood. ‘It's incredibly unsexy kind of information, but it does go right to the heart of what this is about,’ he said. Devyani Khobragade was arrested earlier this . month after being accused of lying on a visa application for her . housekeeper and paying her only $3 per hour . Prosecutors declined to comment on Arshack's claims. Arshack . has represented Khobragade since she was arrested December 13, charged with . lying on a visa form about how much she paid her housekeeper. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has expressed regret over the case while . Indian officials have said they are outraged, particularly at a . strip-search of Khobragade that they say was degrading and unnecessary, . though U.S. authorities have called it standard procedure. Khobragade . has said she has full diplomatic immunity, though U.S. officials have . said her immunity is limited to acts performed in the exercise of . consular functions. Philip Richard, the husband of housekeeper Sangeeta Richard (pictured), filed a court petition in New Delhi saying that his wife was being worked from 6am to 11pm every day by diplomat Devyani Khobragade in New York . She has . been transferred to India's United Nations mission, an assignment that . has been processed by the Indian government and the United Nations but . awaits U.S. State Department approval. She would have broader immunity . in that position. In an . unusual statement last week, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara responded to . what he described as misinformation and factual inaccuracy in the case . by saying Khobragade was accused of creating false documents and lying . to the U.S. government about what she was doing, including hiring a . housekeeper who was working far more than the 40 hours per week she was . contracted to work. Uttam Khobragade, father of Indian diplomat Devyani Khobragade, has been accused of harassing the family of her housekeeper after they complained about her treatment . He also . questioned why there was ‘precious little outrage’ about the treatment . of the Indian housekeeper and her husband while there was so much about . the alleged treatment of Khobragade. He . said his office's sole motivation was to uphold the law, protect . victims and hold lawbreakers accountable, ‘no matter what their societal . status and no matter how powerful, rich or connected they are.’ In the dock: An artist's sketch of Devyani Khobragade at her arraignment in Manhattan Federal Court last week . Protesters in the eastern Indian city of Bhubaneswar, burn an effigy of Barack Obama as the international fall-out of Dr Khobragade's domestic dispute continues to escalate .

Philip Richard, Ms Richard's husband, filed a petition at the High Court in New Delhi in . July saying that his wife was being worked from 6am to 11pm every day. Mr Richard also said the consular . official's father Uttam Khobragade had threatened Mrs Richard's family . saying that he would have them abducted and framed on false drug . charges. In the petition, first seen by Outlookindia.com, . a concerned Mr Richard wrote: 'The treatment of Sangeeta by Devyani . Khobragade is tantamount to keeping a person in slavery-like conditions . or keeping a person in bondage.' The . petition also stated: 'Uttam Khobragade called Sangeeta's family . several times and threatened them that they would have to face dire . consequences if she complains and that he would ruin their future, get . them abducted and frame false charges of drugs against them.' Mr . Richard also wrote that Khobragade had accused his wife of stealing in . front of a U.S. immigration officer but would not provide details of . what the woman took. A group supporting domestic workers' rights demonstrate across the street from the Indian Consulate General on December 20 in New York . Mrs Richard's daughter Jennifer also wrote a letter to U.S. officials saying that her mother was unhappy and wanted to return to India but the diplomat refused to let her go. Mr Richard's claim was dismissed in July, according to his lawyer, because the high court claimed 'no jurisdiction on a crime committed on foreign soil'. The case has escalated into an international incident with Indians reacting with fury over the treatment of Khobragade and her claim of being strip searched at a New York jail before being held in a cell with drug addicts and sex workers.","Lawyer for Devyani Khobragade claim's officials mistook her listed base salary for what she intended to pay her housekeeper .

A Texas teen was kicked out of high school three years ago after telling officials she was raped and police declined to press charges. Rachel Bradshaw-Bean, now 20, was raped by a classmate in the band room at Henderson High School, in East Texas, in December 2010. Instead of seeing her attacker get justice, she was given 45 days in disciplinary school. Ms Bradshaw-Bean chose to speak about the incident to NBC News . after the recent wave of high school rape cases that saw allegations . swept under the rug and accusers shamed by their communities. Devastated: Rachel Bradshaw-Bean was kicked out of high school because she told school officials she was raped . Officials decided the sex was . consensual, charged them both with public lewdness and booted them from . school - she received the same punishment as the boy she says raped her. Her attack happened on school grounds, but the first teacher she told of the horrifying ordeal told her to ‘work it out with the boy,’ she said. The young boy, unnamed because he was a juvenile at the time, asked the devout Mormon to go to the band room one day after school for a talk. She went, and security footage of her accompanying the boy would later be used against her because the visit wasn’t against her will - because she wasn't forced. The boy’s intentions became clear once the pair was behind closed doors, he became violent and raped her despite her repeated pleas to stop. She said no - he forced her. He stole her innocence, robbed her of her dignity. It wouldn't be the first indignity she'd suffer because of him. ‘I was crying. I pulled my pants up and went to the bathroom to clean myself up,’ she said about the immediate aftermath. Shocking: Ms Bradshaw-Bean's accusations were swept under the rug, her mother said . She immediately told the band director. ‘Work it out with the boy,’ he told her. ‘There's no way I would do that,’ she recalled. ‘But I didn’t know what to think. I was 17.’ The teen suffered more indignity later that night while attending a Key Club meeting. She sat silently with her mother, stepfather and young brother – her attacker was also in the room. ‘I didn't tell my parents,’ she said. ‘I didn't want them to have to go through that.’ Ms Bradshaw-Bean is not alone in that feeling of isolation. Only 40 out of every 100 rapes are ever reported, according to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network. She skipped the next day of school, but then returned to tell the assistant band director of the attack. He immediately passed word to school officials, soon the police – and her parents – were involved. Scene of the crime: Henderson High School, in East Texas, is where Ms Bradshaw-Bean says she was attacked . The shattered teen's worst fears were realized, her mother ‘had this look in her eyes, like she had died,’ she said. ‘It kills you. You die. You stay dead for a while,’ mother Colleen Chevallier said. ‘You become another person. I'm not the same person I was before this.’ The result of a medical exam obtained by NBC News showed significant proof of an attack ‘consistent with information given per victim,’ including lacerations to the hyman and bleeding. She gave an interview to investigators during which she was numb, ‘I just felt like I couldn't cry anymore,’ she recalled. One day later police determined the sex was consensual, no charges would be filed. ‘I was so shocked,’ her overwhelmed mother said. ‘I thought, they are pushing this under the rug. She's being treated this way because she's a female.’ Henderson Police declined to comment when reached by NBC News, a Freedom of Information Act filing to obtain case files was denied on ground the accused was a minor at the time. A large discrepancy: Ms Bradshaw-Bean's attacker was one of the 97 out of every 100 accused rapists that walk free . Among the evidence used to cite a burden of proof was the security footage, which showed the girl voluntarily entering the band room. The physical evidence could have come from either consensual sex or an attack, police said. ‘I’m not saying I did not want to do it,’ investigators said she told them, but did not provide any further context. The two teens were charged with lewd conduct and shipped off to disciplinary school for 45 days – together. Only three out of every 100 supposed rapists ever spends a single day in prison, according to RAINN. The boy trash-talked to her to other students. One taunted the girl, telling her she ‘asked for it.’ A relative of the boy cyber bullied her on Facebook. Happiness at last: Ms Bradshaw-Bean recently married Robert Bean, she finally feels happy again . A subsequent Title IX investigation by the Department of Education found the school retaliated against Ms Bradshaw-Bean for reporting the incident. Changes were ordered, the school was required to pay for her counseling. Ms Bradshaw-Bean is trying to move on with her life. She is now happily married to a fellow student she met at college. He supported her decision to go public. ‘I'm as happy as can be right now,’ she said, adding that her attacker ‘took away my joy, but I got it back, double-fold.’ She is studying criminal justice and criminal psychology to eventually help other girls find the justice she never did.","Rachel Bradshaw-Bean, now 20, says she was raped three-years-ago at Henderson High School, in East Texas .

Couples . began lining up Sunday night at the Salt Lake County clerk's office as . they hoped to get licences amid the uncertainty of the pending ruling. They . anxiously eyed their cellphones for news on the decision, and a loud . cheer erupted once word spread that Shelby wouldn't be blocking . weddings. Shelby's . decision to overturn Utah's same-sex marriage ban has drawn attention . given the state's long-standing opposition to gay marriage and its . position as headquarters for the Mormon church. The gay weddings in Salt Lake City were taking place about three miles from church headquarters. They got it: Becky Dustin, left, and Jennifer Rasmussen, right, exit the Salt Lake County clerk's office Monday with their marriage licence . For . now, a state considered one of the nation's most conservative has . become the 18th to allow same-sex couples to legally wed, joining the . likes of California and New York. It's estimated that nearly two-thirds of Utah's 2.8 million residents are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and Mormons dominate the state's legal and political circles. The Mormon church was one of the leading forces behind California's short-lived ban on same-sex marriage, Proposition 8, which voters approved in 2008. The church said Friday it stands by its support for 'traditional marriage,' and it hopes a higher court validates its belief that marriage is between a man and woman. In court Monday, Utah lawyer Philip Lott repeated the words 'chaotic situation' to describe what has been happening in Utah since clerks started allowing gay weddings. He urged the judge to 'take a more orderly approach than the current frenzy.' 'Utah should be allowed to follow its Democratically chosen definition of marriage,' he said of the 2004 gay marriage ban. Lott said the state was disappointed with Shelby's latest ruling and will continue its legal battle. The long wait: Couples in line for marriage licenses on Monday at the Salt Lake County clerk's office . Peggy Tomsic, the lawyer for the same-sex couples who brought the case, called gay marriage the civil rights movement of this generation and said it was the new law of the land in Utah. 'The cloud of confusion that the state talks about is only their minds,' she said. Tomsic said she was relieved that Shelby stuck to his ruling and avoided being pressured by a moral or political majority in the state. 'It's awfully easy to get caught up in the emotion and do a kneejerk reaction,' Tomsic said outside the courthouse in downtown Salt Lake City. 'Fortunately, we have a judge who takes his oath of office seriously.' Meanwhile, couples were getting married once every few minutes in the lobby of the Salt Lake County clerk's office to the sound of string music from a violin duet. Lawyers for the state waged a legal battle on several fronts as they sought to stop the same-sex weddings. On Sunday, a federal appeals court rejected the state's emergency request to stay the ruling, saying it couldn't rule on a stay since Shelby had not yet acted on the motion before him. The court quickly rejected a second request from Utah on Monday. The state plans to ask the court a third time to put the process on hold. Adding to the chaos surrounding the situation is the fact that Utah Attorney General John Swallow stepped down about a month ago amid a scandal involving allegations of bribery and offering businessmen protection in return for favors. The state has had an acting attorney general ever since, and Gov. Gary Herbert appointed a replacement Monday who will serve until a special election next year. In Shelby's 53-page ruling, he said the constitutional amendment that Utah voters approved violates gay and lesbian couples' rights to due process and equal protection under the 14th Amendment. Shelby said the state failed to show that allowing same-sex marriages would affect opposite-sex marriages in any way. The decision drew a swift and angry reaction from Herbert, who said he was disappointed in an 'activist federal judge attempting to override the will of the people of Utah.' The state quickly took steps to appeal the ruling and halt the process, setting up Monday's hearing before Shelby. The ruling has thrust Shelby into the national spotlight. He has been on the bench for less than two years, appointed by President Barack Obama after GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch recommended him in November 2011. Shelby served in the Utah Army National Guard from 1988 to 1996 and was a combat engineer in Operation Desert Storm. He graduated from the University of Virginia law school in 1998 and clerked for the U.S. District Judge J. Thomas Greene in Utah, then spent about 12 years in private practice before he became a judge.","Gay marriages were allowed to continue in Utah despite a state request to block them .

Governor Andrew Cuomo is coming under fire after saying that Hurricane Sandy was 'more impactful' than Hurricane Katrina, even though the 2005 storm still caused significantly more deaths. The New York governor ignored the staggering different death tolls- Hurricane Katrina caused 1,833 deaths while Sandy is attributed in 121 deaths- but went on to say that last month's hurricane 'affected many, many more people and places than Katrina'. He broached the controversial topic during a press conference on Monday while explaining his rationale in asking for nearly $42billion in federal aid for the reconstruction process. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . VIPs: U.S. President Barack Obama listens as New York Governor Andrew Cuomo (L) speaks after Obama toured hurricane-battered Staten Island neighborhood. Cuomo said Sandy was worse than Katrina in some respects . Harbinger: Superstorm Sandy just before it slammed into America's East Coast. The damage clean-up is still ongoing . New York's demands raise the total estimates for the storm's damage, as all of the affected East Coast states combined now require at least $71,3billion. The total, which is substantially larger than previous estimates of $50billion and could still grow, came as Cuomo laid out his state's needs. He said that their total of $41.9billion is made up of including $32.8billion to repair and restore damaged housing, parks and infrastructure and to cover lost revenue and other expenses, as well as $9.1billion to mitigate potential damage from future severe weather events. As many are still grappling with the devastation from Hurricane Sandy, the governor's words appeared callous to some Twitter users. 'Human life trumps property. How did you miss that?' wrote Vanessa Robinson. Another man, identified only as Mitch G, said that it was just an example of Cuomo being a politician: . 'Of course Sandy was worse than Katrina for Governor Cuomo, because it was his state that got hit this time.' Ben White, an economic reporter at Politico, wrote 'slow your roll, gov' when he retweeted the news on his personal Twitter account while his co-worker Maggie Haberman wrote 'seems like this isn't wise'. Hellish: Breezy Point in Queens, New York. The fire ripped through ore than 100 houses in the flooded neighborhood . Destroyed: A collapsed house in Staten Island. New York officials have outlined measures costing $9.1billion to help protect against further storms . While Sandy may have damaged more homes and businesses, Katrina took a far greater toll on human lives, killing more than 1,800 people directly or indirectly. Sandy, by comparison, is believed to have killed at least 121 people. 'Hurricane Katrina got a lot of notoriety for the way government handled -- or mishandled, depending on your point of view -- the situation,' Cuomo said at a press conference. 'But considering the dense population of the area Sandy impacted and costs to the economy, housing, and businesses, the damage done 'was much larger in Hurricane Sandy than inHurricane Katrina, and that puts this entire conversation, I believe, in focus,' Cuomo said. Devastation: The governors of New York and New Jersey say the estimated cost of Superstorm Sandy is $71billion, more destructive than Hurricane Katrina. Pictured is Seaside Heights in New Jersey . Deluge: Surf rolls past a destroyed roller coaster wrecked by Superstorm Sandy, which killed at least 121 people . Derelict: A roller coaster sits in the ocean after the Casino Pier in Seaside Heights New Jersey collapsed when Superstorm Sandy hit . Governor Cuomu said the damage done 'was much larger in Hurricane Sandy than in Hurricane Katrina' Neighboring New Jersey, which saw massive damage to its transit system and coastline, suffered at least $29.4billion in overall losses, according to a preliminary analysis released by Governor Chris Christie's office Friday. The preliminary cost estimate includes federal aid New Jersey has received so far. By some measures, Sandy was worse than Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which tore into the U.S. Gulf Coast in 2005, Cuomo said. Sandy destroyed 305,000 houses in New York state - a still provisional number that's likely to grow - compared to the 214,700 destroyed in Louisiana by Katrina and Rita. Sandy also caused nearly 2.2 million power outages at its peak in the state, compared to 800,000 from Katrina and Rita in Louisiana, and impacted 265,300 businesses compared to 18,700, Cuomo said. Hurricane Sandy hit relatively late in the season, touching ground on October 27. Hurricane Katrina hit the Southwest in the last week of August, 2005, and was followed just a few weeks later by Hurricane Rita. Because Rita came so quickly after Katrina, it's wrath further hindered the reconstruction from Katrina so many of their official damage totals have been grouped together. COST OF RECOVERY: The latest government estimates place the total cost of Hurricane Sandy recovery at $71billion covering all of the damaged areas, while Hurricane Katrina and Rita retain their position as the costliest hurricane in U.S. history tallying up to $108billion. DEATHS: There is no comparison in this category, as 121 people died as a result of Sandy, which is just six per cent of the 1,833 lives lost in the 2005 storms. HOMES DESTROYED: Cuomo's main talking point is that the structural damage that was caused by Sandy was more expansive than Katrina and Rita, and the numbers support that theory. Sandy is cited for the destruction of 305,000 versus the 214,700 caused by Katrina and Rita. BUSINESSES IMPACTED: The dense nature of the impact area of Sandy resulted in 265,300 businesses being affected as compared to 18,700 in 2005. POWER OUTAGES: While most of Manhattan got their power back four days after the storm, thousands remain without power exactly one month on. There were 2,190,000 reported outages this year as compared to the 18,700 from Katrina and Rita. Katrina: The majority of the damage was limited to New Orleans in 2005 . Sandy made landfall in New Jersey on October 29, blasting through the Northeastern U.S., devastating homes, forcing evacuations, crippling power systems and shutting down New York City's subway system for days. The total cost to the region is still not known as estimates of the damage, as well as future repair and prevention costs, continue to come in from all levels of government. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said on Monday he will ask Congress for $9.8billion to pay for Sandy costs not covered by insurance or other federal funds. In a letter to New York's congressional delegation, Bloomberg said public, private and indirect losses to the city from the devastating late-October storm stood at $19billion. Seaside Heights in New Jersey: Smaller coastal communities were among the hardest hit by Sandy . Of that, private insurance is expected to cover $3.8billion, with Federal Emergency Management Agency reimbursements to cover at least an additional $5.4billion, Bloomberg said in a statement. The city still will need the additional $9.8billion to help pay for costs that FEMA does not cover, like hazard mitigation, long-term housing, shoreline restoration and protection efforts, he said. Whatever the final tally, officials are beginning to pressure Congress for federal assistance. Cuomo met on Monday with the state's Congressional delegation and county officials. U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand said in a statement that New York's Congressional delegation will push hard for additional federal funding. Flooded: New York's infrastructure was severely affected by flooding, fires, electricity blackouts and wind damage . 'The federal government has a clear responsibility to commit all of the necessary resources to help us rebuild,' she said. Getting federal funds could be a tough fight, because of pressure on lawmakers to cut spending and raise taxes in order to shrink the federal deficit. 'This will be an effort that lasts not weeks, but many months, and we will not rest until the federal response meets New York's deep and extensive needs,' said U.S. Senator Charles Schumer in a statement. Cuomo's earlier estimates had pegged the total amount of damages for the region at $50billion, with about $33billion of that incurred in New York state. In New York City, Bloomberg said on Monday they had about $4.8billion of uninsured private losses, $3.8billion of insured private losses, and $4.5billion in losses to city agencies. Reconstructing the city's damaged roads alone could cost nearly $800million, Bloomberg said. New York City, a financial and tourism center, also lost about $5.7billion in gross city product, he added, . Included in Cuomo's nearly $9.1billion of mitigation costs are what he called 'common sense' actions, like flood protection for the World Trade Center site, roads, subway tunnels and sewage treatment plants, as well as power generators for the region's fuel supply system and backup power for health care facilities. 'We will see new projects,' said Mysore Nagaraja, former president of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Capital Construction Co.

Obama says in a letter to Congress that about 46 U.S. troops were deployed Saturday to help evacuate Americans. Four U.S. troops were injured in the evacuation mission when gunfire hit three military planes. All four are in stable condition.

He says he's monitoring the situation and may take more steps to ensure the security of Americans, U.S. property and the U.S. Embassy in Juba. Fighting has continued Sunday in South Sudan, where the central government has lost control of the capital of a key oil-producing state. The unrest has raised fears of full-blown civil war. The four U.S. servicemen were wounded after their helicopter was shot at during an evacuation mission. The men had been tasked with trying to rescue American citizens following outbreaks of violence in Bor, the capital of the South Sudan state of Jonglei, Saturday. Targeted: Three CV-22 Osprey aircraft (shown in 2011 file photo) were shot at as U.S. servicemen worked to evacuate Americans in South Sudan on Saturday . The aircraft turned around after being fired at, before heading to Kampala in Uganda, according to US officials. From there, the wounded servicemen were flown to Nairobi in Kenya for medical treatment. It is believed to be the second helicopter to have been shot at in Jonglei this week. On Friday, a UN helicopter trying to evacuate peacekeepers and civilians in the state was fired on, causing 'significant' damage, according to two US officials. Coup: The conflict started last Sunday when troops loyal to former Vice President Machar opened fired at a government meeting in an attempted coup.

Fighting each other: President Obama said in a statement earlier this week that South Sudan 'stands on the precipice' of civil war. Above, SPLA soldiers in Juba on Satuday . Rob McKee, of Warrior Security, said the aircraft was forced to make an emergency landing after suffering small arms fire while trying to evacuate personnel from a base in Yuai. A second official - who wishes to remain unnamed - said the helicopter was abandoned and remains unable to fly. However, no injuries have so far been reported. Next steps: President Obama is currently considering taking more military action in the country . South Sudan has seen some of the its worst ever violence over the past week - claiming at least 500 lives so far. The U.S. military dispatched 46 troops to protect its embassy in the capital of Juba, while the State Department has warned American citizens in the country to leave immediately. Hundreds of people are believed to be trapped in Bor, which is currently in hands of rebels. Meanwhile, thousands of others have fled to UN compounds to seek shelter from the violence. The conflict began on Sunday when troops loyal to ousted Vice President Riek Machar allegedly opened fire at a government meeting in an attempt to force President Salva Kiir from power. Machar was sacked along with the entire rest of the cabinet in July after announcing he was going to contest the 2015 general election. Yesterday, President Barack Obama said the country 'stands on the precipice' of civil war as conflict in the country entered its sixth day. In a statement, he said: 'In 2011, millions of South Sudanese voted to forge a new nation, founded on the promise of a more peaceful and prosperous future for all of South Sudan's people. 'In recent years, against great odds, South Sudan has made great progress toward breaking the cycle of violence that characterized much of its history. 'Today, that future is at risk. South Sudan stands at the precipice. Recent fighting threatens to plunge South Sudan back into the dark days of its past.'

A female tiger has been mauled to death by her intended mate during an attempt to breed the rare animals at San Diego Zoo. The four-year-old female Malayan tiger, named Tiga Tahun, died of neck injuries and breathing difficulties following the attack on Saturday. It was the first breeding encounter for either animal, the only Malayan tigers at the facility. No visitors saw the attack. Mauled to death: Four-year-old Malayan tiger, named Tiga Tahun, was killed by her intended mate during an attempt to breed the pair at San Diego Zoo . '(The encounter) began with positive interaction between the two big cats. Unfortunately this changed quickly and zookeepers were unable to separate the two animals,' the zoo said in a statement. Tiga Tahun's intended mate, Connor, was . born at the San Diego Zoo in 2011. He is one of seven Malayan tigers . born at the San Diego Zoo since 2005. The tigers had been rotated between being on exhibit and in their bedrooms, making them familiar with the other's scent, zoo spokeswoman Jenny Mehlow said. They had seen each other often and even touched noses, separated by a barrier. Their interactions led zookeepers to believe the timing was right. 'Everything was spot on,' Mehlow said. Tiga Tahun's intended mate named Connor pictured as a young cub after he was born at San Diego Zoo in 2011 . There are about 60 Malayan tigers in captivity in North American zoos, said Dan Cassidy, general curator of Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo & Aquarium in Nebraska, which owned the female tiger. Fewer than 500 are believed to be living in the wild worldwide. Fatal attacks are rare, but behavior can be unpredictable during breeding, Cassidy said. Zoos typically prepare by having tigers touch noses or paws before allowing them to interact without barriers. Tiga Tahun was born in 2009 at the Bronx Zoo, where her mother was transferred from Omaha. 'That cat had never been in Omaha, so it wasn't like we had a personal connection, but everyone is saddened by the loss,' Cassidy said.

A group of swans make their way down the flooded River Severn in Worcester today . Leading the way? One intrepid bird breaks away from the pack to eye-up some railing which usually stand at the water's edge . In the first photograph, five swans can be seen making their way down the flooded river. Then, with a certain amount of caution, a few of the animals carefully make their way over a metal fence which usually marks the water's edge. They then have a gander at a sign post and even some bins. Later, at least forty swans can be seen exploring round the red brick buildings in front of Worcester church. Let's go! After careful consideration, the animals paddle over the submerged railing and into the streets of the town centre . Exploring the streets: The flock of swans make their way through the streets of the town, perhaps using the signpost, right, for directions . According to reports, the town saw between 20 - 30mm of rainwater fall throughout Monday. Yesterday, the Met Office issued yellow warnings in Worcestershire for rain, strong winds and flooding on the river Severn. Three flood warnings and six flood alerts were issued for the county. The extreme weather was expected to last throughout today with the river predicted to reach six metres at Diglis House, Worcester town centre. Taking in the sights? One swan swims past a bin. Between 20 -30mm of rainwater fell in the town overnight, with the Met Office flood warnings across the county .","Flock of swans paddle through the streets of Worcester after the river Severn burst its banks .

For more than a century this grand chamber lay neglected and damp under the streets of south east London, echoing only to the sound of passing trains. Now the entry shaft to the Thames Tunnel, whose sweeping staircase teemed with a million visitors in the month after it opened in 1843, is being restored. Touted as the birthplace of the modern Metro system, the first underwater tunnel in the world - built by Isambard Kingdom Brunel and his father Marc - is one of the most important sites in engineering history. Scroll down for video . Iconic: The 42ft high, 50ft wide entrance to the Thames Tunnel was descended by a million Victorian thrillseekers in its first month. But it closed in 1869 when the twin tunnels below (see left) were converted to take trains. Now a concrete floor has been installed (right) and volunteers have won a grant for a full restoration . Stark: The chamber has reopened for the first time with a concrete floor separating it from the trains, and volunteers have grand plans for it. They have won a grant to restore the entrance to its Victorian glory with bazaars and underground attractions. Pictured, the outline of the original staircase can still be seen clearly on the wall . Legendary: The chamber teemed with people as Isambard Kingdom Brunel, top, waved his hat to admirers after it opened. The two tunnels now take trains . Urban history: About 4,000 people have flocked to see the tunnel chamber since it was made safe, and it will now be given a full restoration by the Brunel Museum . Traffic: As the first footway under a navigable river, it was a huge relief to traders who claimed it could take longer to cross the Thames by boat than the Atlantic. Construction had to be abandoned in 1828 after the partially-built tunnel was totally flooded, almost killing Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The tunnel opened in 1843 . The double foot tunnel alleviated crisis congestion on the Thames, which merchants claimed could take longer to cross than the Atlantic. In its heyday it hosted market stalls, fire-eaters, an infamous fundraising banquet when still part-finished, and later, unwanted prostitution. But the tunnels were converted to take . trains in 1869, leaving their 50ft-wide entrance redundant. They still take trains today and their shaft was completely inaccessible until recently, when the chamber was separated from the railway tracks for the first time with a £250,000 concrete floor. Visitors must wriggle through a 4ft entrance passage before descending a tower of scaffolding onto the ground, where they can feel London Overground trains rumbling below. MailOnline can reveal the Brunel Museum, which adjoins the site in Rotherhithe, London, has won a grant to restore a full entrance and permanent stairway into the shaft for the first time in 145 years, a move they hope will turn it into a major tourist attraction. The details of the grant have not yet been announced, but it is thought to be worth about £250,000 and the work can start as soon as next summer. A second phase worth £1 million will connect the shaft to the museum, in Brunel's old boiler house. Family affair: The tunnel was a joint project between the engineer Marc Brunel (left) and his son Isambard Kingdom Brunel (right), who went on to achieve legend status . Impressive: Marc Brunel's first underwater tunnel in the world - which he built with his son Isambard - is one of the most important sites in engineering history . Imprint: All that remains of the once-grand staircase into the tunnel shaft is this ridge along the wall. Soon the 170-year-old chamber will become a full tourist attraction . Tribute: One of the only items inside the chamber now is a statue of Brunel looking up to the only source of light. Right, visitors must descend a scaffolding tower . Squeeze: Today the only way into the 42ft high tunnel shaft is to wriggle through an entrance passage, pictured, and down a scaffolding tower . Museum director Robert Hulse, 60, said the money was 'in the bank'. He added: 'You take a Metro train anywhere in the world and your journey really began here. It's the birthplace of the underground transport network and in that sense it's the birthplace of the modern city. 'They originally intended it for cargo, but they couldn't afford the ramps to get the cargo into the tunnel. So what they opened was a cargo tunnel that couldn't take any. 'Instead they turned it into a market. There was dancing and performing horses - God knows how they got the horses down there - along with sword swallowers, Ethiopian serenaders and fire-eaters. 'We're going to convert this space into what it once was - a palace of delight and entertainment.' The gigantic, 1,000-tonne circular shaft was built above ground and then sunk into the soft London earth before construction on the tunnels could start. The tunnels were revolutionary because they used the first ever tunneling shield, an iron box divided into 36 'cells' each containing a worker. It protected them as they dug out the soft earth and has since evolved into the tunnel boring machines used today. A previous attempt without a shield had to be abandoned in 1808 when it collapsed just 200ft from the end. Revolutionary: The tunnel was the first to use a shield, an iron box divided into 36 'cells' each containing a worker which has evolved into modern tunneling machines . Grandiose: The tunnel hosted a fundraising banquet in 1827, before it flooded. In the foreground are Marc Brunel and his son, the only known image of them together . Eighth wonder of the world: Once the new attraction was finished it teemed with visitors, 50,000 of whom attended on its first day and a million in its first month . History: A London Overground worker inside the main section of the Thames Tunnel, which still takes regular trains despite being the oldest of its kind in the world . Iconic: Isambard Kingdom Brunel went on to design the Clifton suspension bridge, pictured, and has been named as one of the worthiest Britons in history . Digging under the Thames clay was still a dangerous business, however. Workers could bear only two-hour shifts until they collapsed from exhaustion. The whole tunnel flooded midway through its construction in 1828, killing six workers and very nearly handing Isambard Kingdom Brunel the same fate. Legend has it the great engineer - who would go on to design the Clifton suspension bridge - swam through the torrent as it rose until he was hauled unconscious from the exit. Mr Hulse is the only paid member of a team of volunteers which has spent years lobbying for the chamber's restoration. His efforts have won the former teacher and actor the Freedom of Bermondsey, meaning he has the right to drive sheep across London Bridge. Though he added: 'I haven't exercised it yet'.","Thames Tunnel in south east London was built by legendary engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel and his father Marc .

Action: 7,500 workers will protest against a 1% below-inflation pay rise by walking out next Tuesday . Thousands of police civilian staff, including 999 call handlers, will strike on New Year's Eve. The Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union today revealed 7,500 workers will walk out in protest against their one per cent pay rise, well below inflation. Timed to coincide with a walkout by London firefighters, the announcement has sparked fears for safety on one of the busiest days of the year. Police and community support officers, 999 call handlers, detention officers in custody suites, and a range of administration and professional support staff are among those who would take action. The Met has already cancelled leave for police officers and is making contingency plans. The PCS said the strike was voted for by almost three to one. However . the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) said just one in 12 police staff . voted for strike action. Kim Hendry of the PCS said: 'Police staff feel undervalued and underpaid. We have members forced to take second jobs, or use payday loans, just to keep afloat. 'Our demands are entirely reasonable - last year the Met saved over Â£50 million on the police staff budget due to job cuts. 'Just some of that money should be used to fund a decent pay rise, and they are calling on the commissioner and the deputy mayor to demonstrate that they genuinely value the hard work and commitment of police staff.' The Metropolitan Police described the one per cent pay rise as being 'at the ceiling of the Government's public sector pay policy and the pay increase was given without any strings attached to it'. It claimed the PCS's demands include a pay increase of up to six per cent. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'The PCS has now informed the MPS that they intend to take strike action on New Year's Eve - one of the days when demand for our services is highest. The Met has cancelled leave for officers to accommodate on one of the year's busiest days (file picture) 'We have tried-and-tested business continuity plans for all eventualities, including industrial action. These ensure that critical functions performed by police staff are performed by police officers who are fully trained in those roles. 'To ensure we are able to implement these plans, we stopped granting any further requests for annual leave or days off for officers and staff in a number of key areas for New Year's Eve in mid-December. 'In some cases we've also had to take the very difficult decision to cancel planned days off for officers with certain critical skills or in critical operational areas. 'These are clearly all steps we'd rather not take, but we have to be prepared to maintain critical operational areas in the event of a strike action by police staff, and we are confident that we have appropriate plans in place.'","7,500 workers will walk out over below-inflation 1% pay rise, PCS revealed .

Two sisters who live more than 3,000 miles apart have given birth within minutes of each other. The siblings even kept up with each other on Facebook as they both went through labour at home. It was an almost incredible coincidence for Andrea Mansfield, from Melling, Liverpool, who gave birth to her sixth son, Michael on Friday 6 December. Minutes before the delivery, her sister Audrey Westich, 29, gave birth to a baby boy, Levi, in Pennsylvania, USA. Andrea was supported by community midwives Rachel Mavers and Amy Kelly, from Liverpool Women’s Hospital, who called it their most amazing home birth yet. Andrea, 33, who gave birth 19 minutes after Audrey, said: 'It was amazing. We joked about it but never dreamed that it would happen. 'We both had home births, we both had boys and we gave birth on the same day, 19 minutes apart, although because of the time difference I was in the afternoon and she was in the morning.' The women said they had been comparing notes and their bumps on Skype all the way through their pregnancies. Andrea added: 'This happened because Audrey was five days late and I was two days early. We are going to call our boys ‘cousin twins’.' Crowding round to see the new arrival with father James were Andrea’s other sons: Elijah, seven, Stephen, six, Daniel, five, Joshua, three and 12-month-old Benjamin.

Saved: Mike and Caroline Jenner thought their pet Quila had drowned after she was swept out to sea off the Norfolk coast . Mr Jenner, 71, of Stalham, said: 'It was going to be a terrible, miserable Christmas - but that was swept away and everything is wonderful now.'

England have already lost the Ashes, conceding an unassailable 3-0 lead to their hosts after a third successive wide-margin defeat in Perth last week. It is highly unlikely that two spinners would be considered at the MCG, but possible for the final Test in Sydney.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced on Twitter the website had 'surpassed a million site visits', according to ABC News. A staggering 850,000 of these visits happened before 2pm (7pm GMT), according to CMS spokesman Julie Bataille. This followed more than 1.2million site hits at the weekend. The website - which has faced a series of problems since its launch - has deployed a queuing system to deal with the high traffic.

Customer Liz Meitner, 56, told TV crews at a Washington library that she had been trying to sign up for health insurance - which kicks in on January 1 - since enrollment first became available, but had so far been unsuccessful. The . President of the United States didn't have to test his patience with . the error-prone website or spend hours on the phone with a volunteer .

Obama simply dispatched his aides to the Washington, D.C. insurance . exchange's office, where they filed his papers in person – while Obama . himself luxuriated in his annual Hawaiian vacation with his family. 'His situation is unique,' the official insisted. 'The . president couldn't have used the DC exchange's website because the . databases these sites use to confirm insurance eligibility wouldn't . contain those sorts of records about him.' Obama . chose 'a bronze plan' – the cheapest option – according to the White . House.

'The implementation has been unsuccessful as far as I'm concerned so far - I'm almost in shock', she said at the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library. 'It's just so hard to believe they could be so inefficient with something so important.' The deadline for people to sign up for health care coverage was supposed to be 11.59pm yesterday. However, due to the site's record traffic, the deadline has been pushed back to midnight tonight, according to The Washington Post. The . White House has insisted that it is doing all it can to make sure . people who miss the deadline can still get coverage under a series of . exemptions, and apparently this date bait-and-switch is another way of . trying to help. There is a 'hardship' exception for . some that permits them not to sign up any kind of health insurance at . all without facing a penalty - the hardship being problems they've . encountered with Obamacare and its malfunctioning website. There will also be a 'good faith exception' for others, according to a senior Obama administration official. 'We'll . have a special enrollment period,' the official said last week, for . 'all those who make a good faith effort to get enrolled by the deadline' but fail to do so. The official did not say how the government would determine whether or not the effort was made in good faith.

Such . is the uncertain state of 'Obamacare' as it approaches what was . originally supposed to be a defining moment - a signup deadline that . would provide the first real test of the viability of the healthcare . program brought into law by the Affordable Care Act. Adding to the confusion is the fact that the original deadline for obtaining medical coverage was December 15. That . was extended to December 23 after the federal government's website, . HealthCare.gov, proved dysfunctional and sometimes non-functional. Obama . said on Friday that one million people had enrolled for new insurance . plans under the law through HealthCare.gov, which serves 36 states, and . 14 state-run marketplaces.

Unseasonably balmy weather settled over Southern California yesterday as the region already accustomed to celebrating Christmas without snow experienced temperatures 15 degrees above normal. The warm spell baked the West Coast while the Midwest, Northeast and parts of Canada were still dealing with the aftermath of a winter storm. Hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses were without power on Christmas morning, energy companies reported. Festive: Nicole Englanoff, 19, (right) and Leah Zeffren, 19, sunbathe on the beach on Christmas Day in Santa Monica, California . Southern California temperatures climbed to record or near-record levels in the upper 70s and low 80s, propelled by warm, dry Santa Ana winds blowing toward the Pacific from the high deserts, meteorologists said. By midday, the temperature reached 81 degrees Fahrenheit in downtown Los Angeles and was expected to top out just short of the city's record Christmas day high of 85 degrees, set in 1980. The afternoon warmth followed an overnight low of 47. Temperature records for the city date to 1877. The city of Long Beach, about 20 miles south of Los Angeles, saw the temperature soar to at least 83, 2 degrees Fahrenheit above the 1972 record for Christmas Day, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Curt Kaplan.

Daytime highs also were forecast to approach record levels in Burbank and San Diego. Southern California's normal daytime highs range in the mid- to upper 60s this time of year. The region's coastal conditions likewise brought little Christmas cheer, with low waves expected to frustrate surfers who traditionally wear Santa Claus costumes to ride the swells at this time of year.

Capping a year of scant rainfall, the arrival of Santa Ana winds also prompted the Weather Service to post a ""red flag"" advisory for much of Los Angeles and Ventura counties, warning of a high risk of wildfires due to dry, blustery conditions. The Santa Anas arise when a high-pressure area forms over Utah and Nevada, producing a strong, westerly air flow that heats up sharply as it blows through the desert mountains of southeastern California and descends into the coastal basins below, meteorologist Mark Moede said.

Claims: A Tory MP and his wife have been accused of groping their housekeeper while asking for a threesome (stock picture) A TORY MP and his wife lured their lesbian housekeeper from the servants’ quarters and tried to engage her in a threesome, a tribunal heard. The couple, known only as Mr and Mrs P, allegedly groped the middle-aged woman and tried to perform a sex act on her as they sat drinking wine on a warm summer’s evening. The pair giggled as their ‘humiliated and scared’ employee fled from their advances and barricaded herself in her bedroom, the employment tribunal heard. A few weeks after the alleged assault the woman was abruptly told to leave the house, she alleged. The MP gave her £300 cash and a letter claiming they had discussed disciplinary proceedings and that a  severance deal would be drawn up, the hearing was told. The South Coast tribunal heard the housekeeper was invited to live in the MP’s house as a ‘guest’ in the spring of 2012 after breaking up with her civil partner. She said in August last year she was in the staff kitchen when Mrs P invited her to join her and her husband in their sitting room, which she reluctantly agreed to. She told the tribunal that as she sat on the sofa the MP came and sat close to her. She said: ‘Mrs P then came and sat on the floor between his legs. 'I felt very uncomfortable with Mr P sitting so close to me and opted to sit on the edge of the sofa. ‘Following a short conversation, Mrs P placed her drink on a tray and began to French kiss Mr P who was sat next to me. ‘I was extremely embarrassed and looked away… as I really did not know what to do. I hoped they would soon stop. ‘Instead, I felt a hand touch me in my crotch… I was wearing jeans. Houses of Parliament: The housekeeper is claiming for sex discrimination and unfair dismissal after the Tory MP allegedly told her weeks after the alleged assault that she had an hour to leave the house . ‘I was extremely shocked and jumped at . the feel of the hand and saw it was Mrs P’s hand. I shot back into the . back of the sofa and as soon as I’d done this, Mr P then proceeded to . place his hand on the top of my thigh. ‘I was very shocked and scared by what . was happening and shot to my feet. I said, “I’m sorry, I’m not into . this sort of thing” and I quickly left the room.’ She continued: ‘As I left, I could . hear Mrs P giggling. They both clearly thought it very funny but I was . extremely upset and scared and went directly into my room and I . barricaded my door.’ The MP in the tribunal yesterday denied he would ‘pop out naked’ around his home in front of the housekeeper. Mr P described himself as a ‘courteous gentleman’ who would never behave that way. His assertion came after his housekeeper told the hearing he would often appear about the house without clothes. She said: ‘This happened on a number of times to the extent I did not think it could possibly be accidental.’ She said she spoke to Mrs P about it, but she was ‘dismissive’ and Mr P continued to appear naked in front of her. She added: ‘I’d be extremely embarrassed and would apologise for being there and would walk away immediately.’ The housekeeper claimed Mrs P would also often undress in her presence when she was cleaning the bedrooms. But Mr P told the tribunal: ‘I have never behaved like that in front of anyone… I would never come out of the shower naked. I would always have a towel around my waist if I was not wearing shorts or such like. ‘I did not just pop out naked in front of her.’ He also told the hearing that he understood that the housekeeper liked to sunbathe naked. Her bosses went on holiday early the . day after the alleged incident and when she next saw Mrs P over a . fortnight later she asked to see her alone in the kitchen. The housekeeper told the hearing: ‘She . said she did not wish to talk about what had happened and asked me not . to speak to anyone else about the incident. ‘She also asked that I did not “let . her down”. I assumed by this request that if I did not speak of the . incident again, then my position would be safe.’ She continued: ‘Mrs P did not ask me . how I was feeling about the incident or indeed make any apology or . attempt to remedy the situation.’ But a few weeks after the alleged . assault, the housekeeper claims Mr P told her she had an hour to leave, . citing a series of  fallings out that she had had with other members of . their staff, the tribunal heard. She said he gave her £300 and a . letter falsely claiming they had discussed disciplinary proceedings and . that a severance deal would be drawn up. The housekeeper also claimed she was . offered £5,000 to ‘waive her right’ to take the matter to an employment . tribunal, which she says she declined. She is claiming sexual . discrimination, unfair dismissal and wrongful dismissal. She told the . tribunal: ‘The harassment and dismissal from my position and my eviction . have caused me significant problems including distress, anxiety and . depression. I felt considerably low and considered suicide as life did not seem worth living.’ The MP and his wife strenuously denied . the allegations, calling them ‘wholly untrue and ridiculous’ and . accusing the woman of attempting to extort money from them. Mr P said: ‘It is a complete . fabrication from start to finish. I can never remember asking the . claimant into our TV room, sitting down with her, or having a drink with . her.’ He added: ‘My wife would never behave in that manner.’ The hearing continues.","Woman claims couple molested her in lounge after inviting her for a drink .

New grandmother Princess Michael of Kent got into the Christmas spirit early this weekend as she headed out for a festive lunch with her family. Dressed warmly in shearling and fur, Princess Pushy was joined by husband Prince Michael of Kent, daughter Lady Gabriella Windsor, 32, and son Lord Frederick Windsor, 34 at the appropriately named La Famiglia restaurant in Chelsea. The foursome spent almost two hours inside the exclusive World's End haunt before heading back out into the chilly afternoon air. Princess Michael wore a brown leather sheepskin jacket with a fur trim around the collar and a matching brown leather handbag, and appeared to be carrying a paper bag when she left the Chelsea restaurant . After their meal, Lord Freddie held the restaurant door open for his sister and parents . The family appeared to leave their personalised black BMW car on double yellow lines for over 1 and half hours . But more than a few eyebrows were raised . when it was discovered that the Royal couple had chosen to leave their . black BMW on double yellow lines for more than an hour while tucking . into an Italian lunch at the restaurant. It isn't the first time that Princess Michael, 68, has ruffled feathers in recent weeks. 10 days ago, she launched an impassioned defence of her right to complain about being made to pay rent on her lavish Kensington Palace apartment and claimed she and her husband, cousin to the Queen, lived in ‘austere economic times'. Speaking to the Times, she revealed how she and husband Prince Michael, 71, have been forced to embrace austerity along with the rest of the country, eating all their meals at home since dining in restaurants has become too much of an extravagance, and flying by budget airline easyJet. But it seems her austere new lifestyle doesn't extend to the Christmas period, with the royal pair seemingly happy to bend the ‘no dining out’ rule. Prince Michael walked by his daughter's side after the meal, laughing and talking and the royal couple were then seen pointing at an antique shop window at an item which had taken their eye . After hugs and kisses, Lord Freddie walked in one direction and the rest of the family were seen driving off in the BMW . The intimate luncheon was kept low key, with just the family in attendance and with no security present. During . the meal, the family tucked into Italian classics such as cuttlefish . risotto and roast wild boar with rosemary, garlic and olive oil served . with swiss chard. For the lunch, the princess wore a brown sheepskin . jacket with a fur collar, and a matching brown leather . handbag which she paired with loose black slacks and a jade necklace. The . rest of the family also dressed down for the gathering, with the . exception of Prince Michael who wore a pair of bright green . trousers. As the family left the restaurant, Princess Michael was seen holding a La Famiglia branded bag, (taking home some leftovers in an attempt to save a few more pennies?), although that didn't stop her from eyeing up an interesting piece on display in the window of a nearby antique shop. After the lunch, Prince and Princess Michale returned to their car with daughter Lady Gabriella Windsor, 32 . After a flurry of hugs and kisses, Lord Freddie walked in one direction while the rest of the family piled into the BMW. Although it is not yet known whether the family will be joining the Queen and the rest of the Royal Family for Prince George’s first Christmas at the Sandringham estate, a large number of Windsors are said to be attending this year and an appearance seems likely. If the couple do attend, the princess certainly won’t have any problems finding stocking fillers, as she is currently is promoting her first novel, The Queen of Four Kingdoms, the first in a trilogy.","Prince and Princess Michael of Kent enjoyed lunch at a Chelsea restaurant .

The former Patriots player is charged with the murder of Odin Lloyd and he appeared in a Falls River, Massachusetts court on Monday because his defense team says that the district attorney is jeopardizing his right to a fair trial.

Hernandez turned around and smiled at the supportive women but those emotional sentiments sent another woman into a tailspin as Odin Lloyd's mother broke down in tears and had to leave the courtroom briefly to compose herself. Hernandez is accused of killing Lloyd, a 27-year-old semi-professional football player who was dating Ms Jenkin's sister. The defense attorneys argued that the prosecution has been making prejudicial public statements against the accused murderer which could hinder the impartiality of the jury, according to Associated Press reporter Erika Niedowski who was in the courtroom. They said that the 24-year-old . football player should be able to have a jury 'that has not been . poisoned by either false or sensational statements' though the district . attorneys deny any wrong doing.

We're playing fair,' prosecutor Bill McCauley said. 'We are playing fair,' prosecutor Bill McCauley said, according to Associated Press reporter Erika Niedowski who was in the courtroom.

A Massachusetts pharmacy has agreed to pay $100million to settle claims from a deadly 2012 meningitis outbreak. New England Compounding Pharmacy Inc of Framingham, was sued after at least 64 people died and 751 fell ill across 20 states late last year. All the infections stemmed from an NECC-made steroid injection, authorities said. The settlement was announced Monday, but still requires court approval, according to Reuters. Infected: A doctor shows a digital slide on his computer screen of a patient's MRI showing the infected area of the spine due to a contaminated steroid infection . Back pain drug methylprednisolone acetate was the culprit, and it was tainted before it ever left NECC, said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The tainted vials were shipped around the country and administered to patients suffering chronic back pain. The compounding pharmacy saw the writing on the wall as infections began to mount and filed for bankruptcy just days before Christmas last year, according to documents. The terms of the settlement allowed NECC to deny any wrongdoing, but was hailed to Reuters as ‘a big step forward in getting justice for victims’ by lawyer for the victims Thomas Sobol. ‘We are pleased that a significant amount of funds will become available for distribution to victims and their families as compensation for the deaths, injuries and suffering they endured as a result of this tragic meningitis outbreak,’ bankruptcy trustee Paul Moore added. The money to settle the claims is expected to come from the owners, insurers, tax refunds and the sale of another business.","At least 64 people died and another 751 became ill .

The Christmas special is usually the most star-studded episode of the year and 2013 was no exception with Paul McCartney, Barry Gibb and Madonna all making surprise appearances. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg also stopped by the show during his last week in office. Last visit: Outgoing New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg was one of the many special guests on the Christmas episode of Saturday Night Live . Seasoned pro: This was the second time that Fallon has hosted the Christmas episode of SNL . Bloomberg said he was looking forward to relaxing at the end of the year when Bill de Blasio takes over. 'I'll be fulfilling a lifelong dream of consuming a small soda on a smoke-free beach,' he said, poking fun at two of his health initiatives . While his ban on large soda drinks was ultimately unsuccessful, Bloomberg recently passed a law which bans electronic cigarettes in the public spaces of restaurants, offices and beaches. He was also able to squeeze in another ban on Styrofoam cups and trays. As usual Bloomberg was questioned about a possible presidential run in 2016, and he joked that was one of the many options he was considering along with ‘naked cowboy’. Video Source NBC SNL . Post-mayor plans: Bloomberg said he looked forward to enjoying a small can of soda on a non-smoking beach once he left office .

Later in weekend update, Seth Meyers covered the story of tennis champion Billie Jean King being named by President Obama the recent story of Billie Jean King being named appointed by President Obama to lead the U.S. envoy at the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia. Many have considered the move a jab at Russian President Vladimir Putin’s recent ban on ‘gay propaganda’. In the skit, Meyers interviews Kate McKinnon as a flambouyant King, who calls herself President Obama’s ‘big gay middle finger’ that’s ‘about to get flipped’. Kate McKinnon played a flamboyant Billie Jean King, ready to take Russia by storm as the head of the U.S. envoy to Russia . Coming out in Russia: President Obama's selection of King for the envoy has been interpreted by many as a critique of Vladimir Putin's recent ban of 'gay propaganda' in the country . King says she’s going to drive her Subaru Outback into Moscow’s Red Square, doing donuts and blasting Melissa Etheridge. Meyers asks if she’s afraid of getting in trouble, since homosexuality has been suppressed under Putin. ‘Get in trouble, I’m from trouble,’ King says, adding that as a 70-year-old lesbian, she only needs a clean canteen and a sweater to survive and she can summon rescued pit bulls. King goes on to mock many of the Winter Olympic sports as inherently homosexual like ice dancing, the biathlon and two-man luge. While the rest of the skits focused on Christmas or Fallon’s many-varried celebrity impressions, one other skit touched on political commentary. Fallon teamed up with Timberlake to reprise one of their popular past sketches, The Barry Gibb Talk show. Fallon plays The BeeGee's easily-angered frontman who hosts a 'no nonsense' political talk show with his silent brother Robin. Their guests this week were Fox anchor Megyn Kelly, played by Cecily Strong, Republican congressman Paul Ryan, played by Taran Killam, and Madonna as herself. The hits: Fallon and Timberlake reprised one of their old sketches, the Barry Gibb Talk Show, in which Fallon plays the easily-angered BeeGees frontman and Timberlake plays quiet brother Robin . The topic of the show was the recent bi-partisan budget deal passed last week which made certain that the government will not shut down again in the next two years. Kelly was the first to state her opinion on the matter, but accidentally made the mistake of speaking over Barry, causing him to jump out of his seat and threaten to 'take a selfie with your skeleton' and post it on Instagram. After colling down, Gibb asks Madonna to shed her opinion on the subject of bi-partisan, and she gives an eloquent statement about putting personal ideologies aside for the greater good. In a rare change of charcter, Gibb agrees, saying Madonna makes a great point. But when Madonna continues to talk, Gibb breaks again saying 'You already answered the question woman'. Outburst: Barry Gibb exploded at Megyn Kelly (played by Cecily Strong) after the Fox host accidentally interrupted him . Barry is about to go into a fully blown rage when Madonna puts in a grill and stares deep into his eyes. Barry calms down, saying Madonna has tamed him like a wild horse.

"By . Katie  Davies . PUBLISHED: . 15:02 EST, 15 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:04 EST, 15 May 2013 . The FBI has agreed to review the mysterious disappearance of a honeymooner from a Caribbean cruise ship eight years ago. George Smith, 26, vanished from the . Royal Caribbean ship, Brilliance of the Seas, in the middle of the night . on July 5, 2005 just outside the Turkish port of Kusadasi. He had been partying into the early hours with his . 25-year-old wife Jennifer Hagel-Smith and a group of men. She was found passed out drunk in a corridor but George was missing - a large blood stain beneath his cabin balcony indicating he had fallen and then went overboard. Mystery: George Smith was on a honeymoon cruise with his new wife Jennifer Hagel-Smith when he died - presumed overboard . Partying: The couple had been drinking and gambling with new friends they'd made aboard the ship when it is believed Smith went overboard around 5am . After an eight year campaign his family this week got the answer they've been waiting for - FBI officers in New York will review his case and their suspicions that foul play was involved. 'Yesterday we put a circle on the calendar because that's the day we felt we went from a minus to a plus and we felt finally we were going to get answers,' George's father, who is also named George, told CNN. 'A lot of evidence has been accumulated now and I think with a fresh set of eyes looking at that evidence that arrests are inevitable,' George's sister, Bree Smith added to the broadcaster. Four men confirm they were the last to see George alive on the dream cruise he had planned with his new wife. Josh Askin, Rusty Kofman and Zach and Greg Rozenberg were also traveling on the ship with their families. The group had all been drinking Absinthe and gambling with the newly-married man earlier in the evening. They claim they left a drunken George . in his room and put him in bed, before returning to Zach and Rusty's . suite to order room service. However, a private investigator hired . by the family told CBS's 48 hours that the ship's records show no . details of any room service order. Lost hope: A photograph taken by a passenger showed blood on the edge of a lifeboat canopy . Several short phone calls were made . from the suite following 4.13am, according to Attorney Mike Jones, but . no food was documented as ordered on the ship's log. He also points out a video . exists of three of the men - Kofman and the two Rosenberg brothers - . allegedly 'joking' about Mr Smith's death over breakfast. Though the FBI has held the recording since 2005, Jones made public its alleged contents for the first time. He claims Kofman makes a joke about . the man parachuting off his balcony while Greg Rosenberg stands up at . the end and 'makes gang signs' and says 'told you I was a gangster'. All four men and lawyers acting on their behalf have denied any involvement in the death of Smith from Greenwich, Connecticut. CBS approached Kofman in the film and . questioned him about the alleged video comment. He said he had no . comment and urged the presenter to contact his lawyer. Albert Dayan who was previously represented him was interviewed by the network in 2006 and said the men put the newlywed in bed and never saw him again. 'They actually lay George on the bed . and took off his shoes and he displays tremendous gratitude to these . young men,' he told the broadcaster. Last seen: Josh Askin, top left, Rusty Kofman, top right, and Zach, bottom left, and Greg Rozenberg, bottom right, were the last to see George Smith alive . Cabin: This is the room where the men claim they left George Smith in bed . However, one witness - a former . police officer staying next door to the couple - told CBS he only saw . three men leave the suite - something the men also deny. He also claims he heard men arguing on the balcony. Dayan said he believed the 'three . men' spotting was a mistake by the witness and says the men deny ever . going onto the balcony. The neighbor said he later heard the sound of furniture being moved and a loud thud. The witness reports, cell phone video . and room service logs have prompted the Smith family to call for a . thorough new look at George's death. They suspect foul play. 'I just don't understand how the FBI . could have had this tape in their possession and still we sit here,' George's sister Bree said. 'Get the guys in there. Question them! In another new detail, it has emerged . that the men and their families were later ejected from the ship in . Naples over a claim of sexual assault against Greg Rosenberg and Rusty . Koffman. The men also denied those claims and no charges were brought by Italian police. Jones carried out depositions with all four men in the course of his inquiries. Greg Rosenberg, who was being held in a Florida prison on charges of trafficking, emphatically denied any involvement. Last night: George Smith was captured on surveillance cameras in the casino on the night of his death . Nightmare: George Smith went missing from Royal Caribbean's Brilliance of the Seas in 2005 while on his honeymoon . Never found: Mr Smith, 26, fell from the boat during a Mediterranean cruise close to the port of Kusadasi in Turkey . Although he added that he too doubted the explanation George fell. 'Something crazy went down that night and I hope one day they find out the truth,' he said. Josh Ashkin's lawyer says he has no doubt his client has provided all the information he has on the incident and believes it boils down to a drunken accident. 'I don't know why anybody's missin' the theme here. 'Cause there's one common element ... and it's too much alcohol!' he said. 'And we can go and, you know, blame it on murder and - and -- and blame it on aggressive sexual behavior here. You know what? It's just everybody drinkin' too much and stupid stuff happening. That fits.' FBI New York confirmed to the broadcaster that they would review the investigation. The honeymooner's family have been . frustrated by the investigation to date but hope the renewed focus may . bring them the answers they require. 'We'll get justice,' George's mother . Maureen Smith said. 'Somehow we'll get justice for George. Somebody will . talk. And shame on them that don't. Shame on the people that have put . us through this eight years of hell.' Much-loved: The Smiths of Greenwich, Connecticut say they still need answers over the night their son died . 'He was the funniest guy, you know?' George Smith senior said remembering his son. 'I would sit and have a couple of beers with him and he'd make me laugh . for the whole night. And besides he was so good looking the girls just . fell all over him. He was a just a lot of fun. He was a great guy.' Jennifer Hagel-Smith, an elementary . school teacher,  passed an FBI polygraph test about what happened that . night and Jones believes she too was an innocent victim of what . occurred. The couple had been together for three years when they married in 2005 in a clifftop ceremony in Newport, Rhode Island. She has since remarried and did not take part in the CBS program.","FBI's New York field office agrees to review death of George Smith, 26, .

A spiritual healer accused of sexually molesting women told a court his victims thought he was touching them because of a phenomenon known as ‘phantom hands.’ George Boak said clients would get the sensation of feeling his hands inside them when they would really be just above their body. The 70-year-old grandfather said he had been a ‘Christian healer’ for 25 years and had the ability to send his healing powers to patients from miles away. In court: The 70-year-old grandfather said he had been a ‘Christian healer’ for 25 years . Boak has gone on trial at Bradford Crown Court for groping and assaulting three women who went to him for pain relief. He accepted that he sexually touched one patient, but claimed he responded to an invitation from her to be ‘familiar.’ He stopped immediately when she asked what he was doing. ‘I apologised because I realised I had misread the signs,’ he told the jury. The two other women may have thought he was touching them intimately when he wasn’t, the court heard. ‘From the healing you get all sorts of sensations...you could feel my hands inside you and they might be two inches above the body,’ he said. But prosecutor Michael Smith submitted that his claims about ‘phantom hands’ were a lie. ‘No it’s not a lie it’s well-documented is phantom hands,’ said Boak. Mr Smith said his claim showed an ‘inability’ to face up to what he had done. Boak has gone on trial at Bradford Crown Court for groping and assaulting three women who went to him for pain relief . The woman who reported him to police last year told the court he was the only person who could ease the chronic back pain she had suffered for years, but she felt uncomfortable about some of the remarks he made to her. She said Boak would tell her how attractive she was, but she stopped going for healing sessions at his home because of the comments. The patient returned out of ‘sheer desperation’ because of the pain. The woman described how Boak put his hand inside her bra during an alleged sexual assault last year. ‘I dragged his hand out really quickly and within seconds he’s got his hand down my leggings,’ he told the jury. She said she managed to get up and ‘hobble’ out of the house and then contacted the police. Another patient came forward when she read about Boak appearing in court in the local paper. She alleged Boak molested her several years ago and ‘froze’ when she read the article. ‘It felt really horrible. It just brought it all back and I thought I need to help this lady.’ She told the jury she had not consented to Boak touching her sexually and said she did not know either of the two other complainants involved in the case. A third complainant has alleged Boak sexually assaulted her while she was naked and even kissed her breasts. The woman asked him: ‘George what are you doing?’ and he replied: ‘Sorry, I got carried away.’ Boak, a former traffic warden from Halifax, West Yorkshire, has denied two charges of sexual assault and one of indecent assault. The trial continues.","George Boak has been a 'Christian healer' for 25 years .

The creator of @pippatips did, however, hint at a possible unveiling during an exclusive interview with MailOnline, saying: 'I’m sure my ghostwriters will want some attention at some point.'

And it seems that neighbouring clubs Manchester United and Manchester City are also top of the table when it comes to ripping off fans over replica football kits. Stunned parents have hit out at the two Premier League clubs after it emerged their children’s strips have crossed the £100 barrier for the first time. Rip-off? Manchester City stars parade their team's new Nike home strip, which costs more than £100 for the child's version . Expensive: Next season's United kit, left, and City's latest strip, right. They are the only two Premier League clubs to charge over £50 for adult shirts . Parents have blasted both clubs and strip manufacturer Nike, with some saying they will refuse to shell out the sum. It is the first time the price for an entire mini replica football kit - consisting of shirt, shorts, socks, Premier League badge on the sleeve and name on the back - has crossed the three figure barrier. Manchester City season ticket-holder Tony Morton, 42, recently paid £109 for a full kit with the name of footballer ‘Silva’ on the back. Last season's Manchester United child's kit - the cost of the new strip is likely to smash the £100 barrier . Mr Morton, a revenue manager from Oldham, Greater Manchester, branded the price ‘ridiculous’ and said the clubs were putting parents’ under immense financial strain. He said: ‘It’s a massive increase on last year. I know they have invested a lot in the team but this is silly. They [children] want to look like the players so they want a name on their backs and the Premier League badge on the sleeve. ‘They would have it on their backs every day so it wouldn’t last.’ Mr Morton, added: ‘The ticket prices for kids are great and by all means make money from merchandising, but not like this. ‘I probably could afford it but I have to draw the line somewhere. £109 for an 11-year-old’s kit is ridiculous.’ Adult shirts, priced at £55, are also the most expensive in the Premier League with United and City the only two teams in the Premier League to charge more than £50. Last season’s City shirt, made by Umbro, retailed for around £44 - meaning this year’s is up by more than 24 per cent. United’s shirt was £50, meaning the increase is 10 per cent. Chelsea are the other top-four team to bring out a new home shirt. Manufactured by Adidas, their shirt retails for £49.99. It is understood that Arsenal, whose kit is also made by Nike, will be releasing a new away strip with price details to come in the next fortnight. Liverpool have also released details of their new home jersey. The traditional red number, made by US firm Under Armour, costs £45. Laughing all the way to the bank: City striker Carlos Tevez's facial expression probably mirrors the club's money men, who are raking in £109 from parents for the new child's strip . Up until recently clubs only changed their two shirts - home and away - in alternate seasons. But that now appears to be a thing of the past with many producing three or four different shirts which they change every year. This is the first time Nike have made a City strip after they signed a six-year deal reported to be worth £72m with the club. United are said to earn £23.5m a year from their agreement with the same company which expires at the end of the new season. The Red Devils are currently negotiating a new deal with Nike. The high price of supporting a football club has been a long-standing complaint among fans. Not only do season tickets now cost more than £1,000 in some cases, but the clubs usually charge a fee for the right just to be on the waiting list to obtain season tickets. Costly: Manchester United striker Robin Van Persie is an idol for thousands of fans, who want to have his name on the back of their shirts, which costs even more money . In 2003, Umbro, the English FA, Manchester United and six sports chains were fined more than £16 million by the Office of Fair Trading for colluding to inflate the price of football shirts. A City spokesman revealed that the shirts were actually £5 cheaper than the suggested price of £60 - which is what the new England shirt, also made by Nike, is selling for. He said: ‘The cost reflects value to the consumer through design, innovation, development, manufacturing, and retailing. CityStores are pricing the adult shirt £5 cheaper than the RRP.’ A spokesman for United said that pricing was an issue for Nike. A Nike spokesman said: ‘The kits contain innovative performance technologies that have a certain amount of R&D costs and although the retailer sets the prices of the kit, we feel the £60 suggested retail price for the adult shirt and £42 SRP for the kids’ shirt represents good value given the level of technology and design which goes into it.’","Parents are left fuming and brand price 'ridiculous'

A Swedish restaurant is taking a walk on the wild side this Christmas by offering up bear, reindeer and beaver. Tyrol at Grona Lund amusement park in Stockholm is introducing bear meatballs alongside a beaver sausage and seven different reindeer dishes. Thankfully, for those with a sentimental connection to Rudolph and the John Lewis advert, the 115ft long Christmas Table buffet also offers a vegan menu. The bear necessities? restaurant Tyrol in Stockholm have put bear meatballs and beaver sausage on the menu for their Christmas Table . Although they are a people better known for minimalist interior design (IKEA) and mainstream fashion (H&M), come Christmas dinner, the Swedes are all about excess. In fact, the meal on Christmas Eve is not referred to as dinner, but Christmas Table – a buffet loaded with everything from pickled herrings to meatballs. The traditional Swedish Christmas Table also includes roast ham, Christmas sausage, spare ribs, gravadlax, beetroot salad and Jansson's Frestelse - a casserole dish made of potatoes, pickled sprats and cream. However, Tyrol has chosen a more unusual route for their menu with a Wild Christmas Table featuring dishes from the northern parts of Sweden where game is a common addition. No need to starve: 'Round three' of the Christmas Table buffet has 26 different types of meats and pates, including boar, bear and deer sausage, smoked reindeer heart and beaver steak . Better come hungry: The annual Christmas Table buffet at Tyrol is 115ft long and includes seven 'rounds' Tasty Rudolph: Guests are offered to sink their teeth into an orange- and cognac cured reindeer topside in 'round three' - the cold meats take . For £62, diners pick from seven ‘rounds’ – named so after the number of times you traditionally return to the buffet table to refill your plate – which consists of herring, salmon, cold meats, entrees, cheese table, dessert and ice cream 'rounds'. Tyrol’s Christmas Table boasts reindeer-steak eggs, smoked reindeer heart, reindeer pastrami, orange- and cognac-cured reindeer topside, smoked reindeer, whole grilled reindeer and Souvas - a traditional Sami reindeer dish. Sweden has the strongest support for hunting in the world with 87 per cent of the population backing the practice, but Tyrol also offers a completely vegan alternative to their Wild Christmas Table. The slightly smaller PETA-friendly menu includes vegan ham and meatballs, 'mustard pickle herring'-flavoured aubergine and soy Christmas sausage. Bottoms up: As is tradition, Swedes start their Christmas dinner with different types of pickled herring - and several shots of aquavit . Tyrol are keen to highlight that although the idea of beaver, bear and Rudolph may sound unconventional, game is one of the most sustainable meats out there. Both the beaver and the bear meat are provided by local hunters in southern Lapland and Angermanland county in the north of Sweden and the reindeer meat is farmed by the Sami community, the indigenous people living in northern Scandinavia. ‘Wild meat is as ecological as it gets,’ says Samuel Cabrera, head chef at Tyrol. ‘We always try to keep a balance between offering the classic dishes and surprising our guests with something new. ‘It is going to be really exciting to see how the beaver sausage is received by our guests and we have also composed a new salad with moose meat.’ ‘Food is so much about inspiration and that can come at any time,’ chef Henrik Stensved adds. This season, Tyrol's Wild Christmas Table celebrates 30 years following the mantra 'from nature to plate'.","Restaurant in Stockholm puts bear and beaver on Christmas menu .

Paris Jackson's mother Debbie Rowe, grandmother Katherine and aunt La Toya Jackson rallied around the teenager on Wednesday night following her suicide attempt. The women were pictured leaving the LA hospital where the 15-year-old is being held on a on a 5585 psychiatric hold, which permits a 72-hour hold for minors. Both Debbie, 54, and La Toya, 57, appeared incredibly somber after the visit in pictures obtained by TMZ, while Katherine, 83, left in the back seat of a chauffeur-driven car. They all left separately. Support: Debbie Rowe, La Toya and Katherine Jackson, seen here in file pictures, visited Paris at her hospital bed in Los Angeles on Wednesday evening . Meanwhile, a source told People, 'Paris is doing well, smiling again and can't wait to see her friends.' There was no sign of Paris' siblings Prince Michael, 16, or Blanket, 13, nor other members of the Jackson clan. (Prince Michael canceled a scheduled appearance on German television on Thursday, following his sister's troubles.) The women all made public statements about Paris yesterday, with Debbie admitting daughter has had 'a lot going on lately'. Paris has recently begun developing a relationship with her biological mother, who relinquished her custody rights to Paris and Prince following her divorce from the Bad singer in 1999. Her grandmother and legal co-guardian Katherine has been very supportive of Paris' decision to reach out Debbie amid her personal turmoil. Reconnecting with her mom: Paris, pictured with Debbie Rowe at her ranch in Palmdale last month, recently reached out to her biological mother because she feels 'lonely' following her father's death . The suicide attempt is understood to have come after a dark time and episodes of self-harming. 'Paris has been very, very depressed for a while. She's been throwing fits and tantrums, kicking and screaming and cutting herself,' a source tells People magazine. 'She misses her father greatly,' the source adds. 'She was the center of Michael's world and it's all different now. She says that she is lonely and that she doesn't feel loved.' The act is considered by many to be a cry for help, with the insider adding: 'Paris is very unhappy and alone. She's living in this place and there's security and uncles and all these hangers-on. And she's alone. That's one of the reasons she reached out to Debbie Rowe â€“ she wants a family, she's missed her dad.' Under psychiatric hold: Paris is understood to be at the West Hills Medical Center in Los Angeles . June 25 will mark the fourth anniversary of Jackson's death. Katherine . lawyer said yesterday the teen is 'physically fine', adding: 'Being a . sensitive 15-year-old is difficult no matter who you are. It is . especially difficult when you lose the person closest to you.' 'Depressed': Paris showed signs of self-harm on her arms in April . La . Toya added: 'We are grateful and appreciate the overwhelming concern . for Paris from both the public and the media, but request  privacy at . this time while our family handles these issues together' It is understood Paris tried to commit suicide after reportedly being denied the chance to attend a Marilyn Manson gig. Other reports have alleged Paris . 'flipped out' and screamed at the relative who stopped her seeing the . goth rocker, and it is claimed she then locked herself in her bedroom at . her Calabasas, California home and cut her arm before leaving a note . and ringing a suicide hotline. Manson has since passed on a message of support via TMZ, saying: 'I hope you feel better. You will be on my guest list anytime you want.' Conrad Murray also chimed in with a message for Paris - cold comfort considering he is doctor convicted of killing her father. 'I don't know what you're going through, but I'm sure whatever it is it must be difficult,' Murray said in a message from jail obtained by TMZ. 'I don't know if there's anything I can do to solve your pain or help you with your problem but I wanted you to know that I am here for you. I have never been gone.' He also referenced the title of a Jackson song, You Are Not Alone. On Thursday it emerged Paris asked for 'emancipation' from her family at one point, according to the US columnist Roger Friedman, who has strong sources close to the Jackson family. Katherine currently shares guardianship of Paris and her siblings with the son of Michaelâ€™s brother, Tito. The court action would have given Paris control over her own life before legally becoming an adult at 18. Paris Jackson has amassed more than a million followers on Twitter and uses the social networking site to share videos, selfies and in recent times, confiding about her troubled state of mind. But she has also found herself the target of cruel cyber-bullying.Twitter trolls have posted messages including 'Die...lesbian' and 'you're such a bully. That's why your dad is dead.' Another branded her a 'ugly b****' and took a swipe about her late father, writing: 'your dad touched little boys.'A recent message read: 'You ugly d*** kill yourself.' Friedman also alleged that Debbie could seek legal custody of her daughter removing her from the Jackson family compound in Calabasas. During his high-profile but deeply troubled life, the King of Pop was fiercely protective of his children - covering their faces in masks in public outings - but since death in 2009, Paris has become the most visible in the public spotlight. Paris, who was just 11 when her father died, delivered the most poignant words of the star-studded service when she tentatively took the microphone and said, 'Daddy has been the best father you could ever imagine.' In the years that followed she granted interviews to Oprah Winfrey and Ellen DeGeneres, appeared in magazine articles and amassed more than a million followers on Twitter. She has also expressed interest in starting a singing career and has plans to star in a upcoming movie. But she has struggled in recent times, and on Tuesday she hinted at her state of mind on Twitter, posting, 'I wonder why tears are salty?' followed by lyrics from the Beatles' song 'Yesterday': 'yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away now it looks as though they're here to stay.' A 20-minute video of the teen applying makeup was posted to YouTube last week. It shows Jackson in what she describes as her bedroom playfully demonstrating how she does her eye makeup. She receives and replies to several texts on her phone while offering cosmetics instruction. She also reveals that she watches the film Tangled three times a week and, as a child, fantasized about marrying a cowboy. Family portrait: Michael Jackson and Debbie Rowe with Prince and Paris . She also makes goofy faces and says, 'I need serious help. I'm crazy!' Paris . wrote on Twitter that she doesn't know how the video, in which she . repeatedly asserts, 'I am so weird,' ended up on YouTube. 'I hope you guys liked it tho and didn't think i'm too crazy,' she wrote. 'i get weird when i'm not around people lol.' Paris . and Prince listed as plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed by their grandmother . against concert giant AEG Live LLC, who she claims is responsible for . her son's death. Katherine Jackson's lawsuit claims AEG failed to . properly investigate the doctor convicted of causing the singer's death, . and pushed the superstar to rehearse and perform a planned series of 50 . comeback shows titled 'This Is It.' Both children are listed as potential witnesses in the case, which is in its sixth week of trial. Marvin S. Putnam, a defense attorney for AEG Live, said Paris and Prince Jackson were deposed in the case because they are named plaintiffs and may be called to testify. He said Paris Jackson's testimony was not a 'grilling' but urged privacy for her and her family. 'There's a real person involved here,' Putnam said. 'There's a 15-year-old girl and something incredibly tragic has happened that none of us know why and I think it would really be in everyone's best interest and particularly in her best interest if rather than blowing this up into something else, that they were given a little bit of privacy to deal with something that has to be a tragic, tragic moment for all of them.'

"Sherwood appointed permanent Tottenham manager on Monday . Former England midfielder says he'd love to emulate Harry Redknapp . Spurs take on West Brom on Boxing Day at White Hart Lane . By . Matt Barlow . PUBLISHED: . 17:41 EST, 25 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:51 EST, 26 December 2013 . For a few seconds during the victory at Southampton, Spurs fans burst into a chorus of: ‘There’s only one Harry Redknapp’. It was probably meant to be a taunt to the home fans, relegated under Redknapp in 2005, rather than a yearning for their former boss. But it had extra resonance on a day when Tim Sherwood celebrated his first win as manager. Same again: Tim Sherwood served under Harry Redknapp and now hopes to emulate his former boss now that he is in charge of Tottenham . Spurs have not won a Premier League game at home since the end of October when they beat Hull City 1-0. Redknapp was the Spurs boss who invited Sherwood back to the club he served as a player and set him on a coaching pathway that has led to the hot-seat at White Hart Lane. And it has not gone unnoticed that his first two games have seen the team perform with the same spirit of adventure that was the hallmark of Redknapp’s Tottenham, who twice finished in the top four. ‘That’s got to be a compliment hasn’t it?’ said Sherwood (right), who was confirmed as permanent successor to Andre Villas-Boas on Monday. New man in charge: Sherwood will lead Tottenham until the end of the 2014/15 season after succeeding AVB . ‘I wouldn’t mind following his career. I wouldn’t mind being a pound note behind him as well.’ His manner, too, is closer to Redknapp than Villas-Boas: quick with a one-liner and not as anxious to appear deep as AVB. ‘They can be all doom and gloom if they want,’ replied Sherwood when asked how he thought this sense of fun might be seen by Spurs fans. ‘I’m going to do it my way. I’m going to be myself. ‘I’m not trying to be Harry Redknapp but it’s a simple game, isn’t it? If you can’t pass the ball to your own team-mates, then you have a serious problem because you are going to have to keep on defending. That’s what we did in the first half at Southampton. But moving forward we just have to try to get the players better.’ Smiles better: Sherwood got off to a winning start in the Premier League at Southampton last weekend and will now hope to defeat West Brom at home on Boxing Day . Sherwood impressed chairman Daniel Levy during his time in charge of Tottenham’s youth development programme and billed himself as the man to restore the traditions of the club to play dashing football. ‘I want the players to enjoy what they’re doing,’ said the former England midfielder, 44. ‘There are pressures but it either goes for you or it doesn’t.  What’s the worst that can happen? You get the sack.’","Sherwood appointed permanent Tottenham manager on Monday .

A controversial burial box which could have held the remains of Jesus' brother is to go on display for the first time since its owner was acquitted of forging its inscription. The discovery of the 2,000-year-old ossuary, or bone box, which bears the words 'James son of Joseph, brother of Jesus', was regarded as one of the greatest archeological discoveries when it was found more than a decade ago. But the find was plunged into controversy when its owner Oded Golan was charged with forging the relic's exciting inscription in 2003. The ossuary (pictured when it was last on display in 2002) has divided experts over its authenticity . He fought to clear his name, and after a ten-year trial, the Israeli antiquities collector was cleared and the mystery of the 'Jesus box' lives on. The limestone box will now go on display to the public, although Mr Golan has not yet revealed where the exhibition will take place. Typical of first century Jerusalem, the box is thought to have held the remains of James the Just, the first leader of Christians in the city after the crucifixion. The box's owner Oded Golan fought a 10 year legal battle after being accused of forging the box's inscription . At that time Jews were laid in a cave after death, and their bones were collected a year later and placed in an ossuary of the kind owned by Mr Golan. He told The Guardian: 'This is the oldest evidence that mentions the name of Jesus Christ.' But despite the acquittal, some doubts remain about the box's authenticity. The box bears the Aramic inscription, 'Ya'akov bar Yosef akhui diYeshua', which translated reads, 'James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus' Professor Christopher Rollston, of the Albright Institute of Archeological Research told the newspaper that he believed the second half of the inscription was added in modern times. Mr Golan plans to display the box alongside expert opinions from the trial, so that members of the public can decide for themselves whether they think the artifact is authentic.","The 2,000 year old box regarded has divided opinion over its authenticity .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 15:25 EST, 1 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:25 EST, 1 June 2013 . Protest: Maria Alyokhina, pictured last year, has gone on a hunger strike after a court blocked her from attending her parole hearing . A jailed member of the Russian punk group Pussy Riot has ended her 11-day hunger strike against prison authorities. Maria Alekhina, 24, claimed there was a campaign of persecution against her at her prison colony in the Ural Mountains. She had complained that officials attempted to turn fellow inmates against her with a security crackdown. Inmates could previously enter and leave . their workplace freely, but now they have to wait for up to an hour for . prison guards to escort them to and from it, Miss Alekhina's lawyer Irina Khrunova said. Miss Alekhina then started her hunger strike after she was barred from attending her own parole hearing. During her strike she was transferred to a hospital in her prison colony in the Ural Mountains town of Berezniki, according to Pyotr Verzilov, the husband of one of her band mates, who visited the prison yesterday. Three members of the band - Alekhina, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Yekaterina Samutsevich - were convicted last year of 'hooliganism motivated by religious hatred' for an impromptu punk protest against Vladimir Putin in Moscow's main cathedral and given two-year sentences. Samutsevich was later released on appeal. Last month a court in the Mordovia province denied parole to Tolokonnikova, 23, who is married to Verzilov. The wait denies them prompt medical care when they sustain injuries during their work sewing uniforms, she added. Samutsevich said the prison administration directly linked the crackdown to Alekhina's 'fight against the prison colony and her open statements against the violations of inmates' rights'. Pussy Riot: Yekaterina Samutsevich, Maria Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova were convicted of 'hooliganism motivated by religious hatred' in August last year . Anti Putin: Members of Pussy Riot, pictured before the 'punk prayer', performed a protest song in a protest song criticising Vladimir Putin in a central Moscow cathedral in February last year . She said the prison administration, . as an arm of the government, had taken a negative attitude toward the . Pussy Riot members from the beginning. 'This negative attitude has been . building up all the time and now it has turned into an open conflict . between the prison colony administration and Masha (Alekhina), and . surely this has very unpleasant consequences,' Samutsevich said . yesterday. Alekhina earlier spent five months in . solitary confinement after claiming that officials deliberately lodged . her with hardened criminals, including a convicted murderer, and . encouraged them to intimidate her. In a complaint filed in January, . Khrunova wrote that officials did nothing after seeing criminals . threaten Alekhina with violence. Helping hand: Sir Paul McCartney has written to the court asking them to allow Ms Alyokhina to attend her hearing . The lawyer said officials also wrote false psychiatric reports and pushed Alekhina into violating colony rules. Judges have recently lifted several reprimands that officials filed against Alekhina. Following Ms Alyokhina’s decision to . go on hunger strike, Sir Paul McCartney wrote to Russian authorities . asking them to consider her parole. The . former Beatle, who has previously expressed his support for the group, . has asked officials to grant Ms Alyokhina the right to be present at a . future hearing in several handwritten letters. He . said: ‘My personal belief is that further incarceration for Maria will . be harmful for her and the situation as a whole, which, of course, is . being watched by people all over the world. ‘In the great tradition of fair-mindedness which the Russian people (many of whom are my friends) are famous for, I believe that you granting this request would send a very positive message to all the people who have followed this case.’ In a further letter, regarding Ms Tolokonnikova, Sir Paul said: ‘I have had a long relationship with the Russian people, and, with this in mind, I am making the following request in a spirit of friendship for my many Russian acquaintances who, like me, believe in treating people - all people - with compassion and kindness.’ Ms Alyokhina's mother, Natalia, said . she had little faith in Russian justice and would not raise her hopes of . her daughter's parole. 'I don't expect anything good from the judge. It will be hard,' she said. According to documents read in court . Ms Alyokhina's behaviour in prison may risk her parole. She is said to . be rude to prison staff and to not respect sleeping hours. The three Pussy Riot members were convicted of 'hooliganism motivated by religious hatred' last August, following a trial seen by their supporters as part of a clampdown on dissent by Putin during his third term in power.","Maria Alekhina is serving two years for Moscow cathedral 'punk prayer'

In a move that will thrill fans and infuriate gay activists, the A&E network will air a super marathon of Duck Dynsasty over the holiday despite the controversy that surrounds the show. Starting tomorrow afternoon and stretching on for over 11 hours, viewers can watch Phil Robertson and his Louisiana clan stroke their beards, bicker with their wives and of course hunt for ducks. The decision will come as a slap to to those who supported the network's decision to suspend Robertson after anti-gay and racially insensitive remarks he made to GQ magazine--and years before in a 2010 sermon--made national headlines. Bowing to pressure? A&E is set to rake in mountains of ad revenue as the network decides to air 11-hour Duck Dynasty marathon in spite of star Phil Robertson's anti-gay tirade . Those who support the decision say A&E is just giving fans what they want: more of one of the most popular reality shows ever. 'I think, honestly, it’s A&E trying to play both sides of the coin,' celebrity blogger Cate Meighan told Fox News. 'They’ve come out and not supported Phil’s statements… however they’re also looking at the backlash from the fans, and they have a huge amount of backlash from the fans.' Robertson, the patriarch of the Louisiana clan on the reality show about hunting, fishing and domestic squabbles, was put on indefinite hiatus by A&E last week for his remarks to GQ magazine characterizing homosexuality as sinful behavior. The network has previously said it was disappointed after reading Robertson's remarks, which it added were his personal views and did not reflect those of the network.

The standoff between the Robertson family and A&E has put big money in the balance as the impasse also threatens a vast array of ""Duck Dynasty"" licensed merchandise that has brought in some $400 million, according to Forbes magazine. Duck Dynasty brand apparel and products, including camouflage bed sheets and reclining furniture, are sold at retailers such as Target and Walmart. And some say it's that lucrative popularity that makes it nearly impossible for A&E to turn its back in the show. The show's fourth season debuted in August to 11.8 million viewers, a record for a cable nonfiction series, A&E said. It averages about 8 million viewers per episode and its Christmas special was most-watched non-sports cable program on U.S. television last week. 'It is really a money thing,' Meighan said.

The mother explained that she would move the car once she’d secured her kids in the back seat, but the woman who was yelling, described as Hispanic, jumped out and launched an astonishing assault, with the help of her friends. Ms Beckwith told Click Orlando: ‘The one [woman] had grabbed me and pushed me down to the trunk of her car and held me while the other girl punched me in the face and scratched my face and pulled my hair out.’ The whole incident was witnessed by Ms Beckwith’s daughter, who screamed uncontrollably throughout.

You can no longer buy toasters that imprint burnt images of Jesus on toast on Amazon.com. The company Vermont Novelty Toaster Corporation's Jesus toaster was the no. 32 best-selling toaster on Amazon this Christmas season but despite the company's popularity, the Burnt Impressions branded toasters have pulled themselves off of Amazon Today. 'Pretty good for a product created by a slacker pothead,' reads the toaster company's Twitter on being named no.32. Turn the other wheat: Burnt Impressions isn't selling their famed toaster on Amazon anymore but they are selling it on their own website . But according to the toaster company, they are a small business that doesn't appreciate the fact Amazon withholds half of their company's sales while Amazon 'reviews their account.' According to the Vermont toaster company, Amazon also takes $8.00 for every toaster they sell and they take 15 per cent of sale proceeds including the shipping charges. In addition to taking the crust off toaster sales, the company's withholding money while they 'review' the account makes it difficult for the toaster to operate efficiently. Vermont Novelty Toaster corporation didn't only pull Jesus toasters. They also pulled machines that create images of The Virgin Mary, Sarah Palin, Obama.butterflies, peace signs, marijuana leaves, and paw prints reports PRnewswire.com . 'We are a small business and this really hurts our cash flow. I have to wait weeks to recoup my shipping costs because of this,' said Galen Dively, the CEO of the company that creates the famed Jesus toasters. Dively explained that pulling the toasters from Amazon may affect them financially right now, but that by saving the money the website once took from their sales, the toaster company will be able to invest in branding and in developing their website. Personal popper: Burnt Impressions also sells toasters that imprint different symbols like the NFL symbol shown here . 'It will be felt for sure; they are a huge resource of millions of customers, but at this point I am feeling confident we can use the thousands of dollars Amazon makes off our toasters each year to successfully promote sales on our website. We control our branding better this way also,' said Dively. Dively also explains that buying the toasters directly off their own personal website is the cheapest way to purchase the item. Dively says that some toasters have never been offered on amazon, one of which is a personalized toaster that will imprint whatever picture the customer chooses. Burnt Impressions toasters prides itself on bringing a personalized twist to everyday food items like toast. They can be purchased at Jesustoasters.com.

An 87-year-old multimillionaire who jumped to his death from his luxury apartment building on the edge of Central Park on Monday was described by neighbors as frugal despite his incredible generosity to charity. Robert Wilson committed suicide on Monday at The San Remo building on Central Park West in Manhattan. He had recently suffered a stroke and his health was failing. Friends said that Mr Wilson, who made almost a billion dollars from his hedge fund on Wall Street, was frugal - despite being so generous to environmental and educational causes. Planned: Robert W. Wilson deliberately gave hundreds of millions of dollars of his fortune away in the years before his death on Monday and told friends he wanted to have it all gone when he died . Neighbor David Tobey told the New York Post: 'Robert, for all his money, never took cabs, never took a limo. He always took the subway. 'On the few occasions when he did grab a cab, he would usually share a cab with someone in the building. He shared a cab with my wife and insisted that she pay half.' Robert Wilson had a personal fortune of about $800million - but the openly gay aetheist recently told friends he had given all but $100million to charity. He apparently could not give away the rest because it was tied up in long-term investments. He jumped from his 16th-floor apartment in the luxury San Remo building on Manhattan's Upper West Side on Monday. A police source told the Post that he had left a suicide note which read: 'I had a rewarding life. Thank you and goodbye to all my friends. Please make sure you cancel all my plans. Tell everyone what I did. I’m not ashamed of killing myself. Sell all my stuff.' Friends saw signs that he may do something drastic as he suffered a debilitating stroke about a month ago and began unloading his fortune in droves. The multi-millionaire did not have any children and his 35-year marriage ended well before his death. Home: Wilson had owned his 16th floor apartment in the historic San Remo building since 1978 and he jumped off the balcony to his death on Monday . The paper reports that he has donated more than $100million a piece to four different charities: The Nature conservancy, the Environmental Defense Fund, the Wildlife Conservation Society and the World Monuments Fund. 'He was the most committed person I have ever known,' World Monuments Fund president Bonnie Burnham said to The Post. 'More than his financial contributions, he brought an astute mind and sharp wit to the organization. He will be missed greatly and long remembered as a visionary donor.' The idea of saving the environment was one that Wilson had spoken about previously, and in a 2011 interview, he told The Financial Times that much of the $600million he had given to charity at that point was directed towards those groups. 'The idea of ""But for my money, it would be gone forever"" appeals,' he said then at the age of 84. Another issue that appealed to him - and was close to his purse strings- was an investment in New York City's Catholic schools. The felt that the tuition at the schools, which were going through financial issues, showed an immediate 'return' and he gave $20million to a fund earmarked for that cause. 'I’m an atheist, but I think the schools are especially good,' he said to the Financial Times. Before the stroke: Wilson, seen here in his colorfully-decorated apartment in 2010, donated hundreds of millions of dollars to environmental and educational causes . He was also proud of the apartment where he lived, making it less of a shock that he chose that as his final resting place. He had owned the apartment since 1978 and his attention to detail and fine art collection has helped him decorate it and refurbish it so that his original price- $300,000- is just a fraction of what he estimated it's worth in 2011- $20million. Wilson is one of many millionaires who live in the building, as Bono, Tiger Woods, Steven Spielberg, Dodi Fayed and Bruce Willis have all had apartments in the building. The apartment has views of Central Park, and Wilson clearly relished looking out at the trees and the lake. 'Who needs a summer place? I've got one,' he said to the Financial Times reporter.

A 900-year-old Welsh village church is threatening to collapse after being devoured hundreds of seven millimetre-long deathwatch beetles. Parishioners had to abandon their regular Christmas services at St Barrwg's Church, at Bedwas, near Caerphilly, South Wales, after it became infested with the notorious beetles. The ancient church has to meet a £300,000 bill in order to save it from being completely destroyed by the deathwatch beetle invasion, and despite donations from the National Lottery, it still has a long way to go. Holy mole-y: St Barrwg's Church at Bedwas, near Caerphilly, South Wales, has become infested with Deathwatch beetles . The Reverend Midge Moore said: ‘The problem is so extensive that the roof was considered to be in danger of collapse. ‘The church was immediately closed and scaffolding erected to support the roof until the work of restoration can be done.’ St Barrwg's has remained intact since it was built in 1102 in Bedwas. But after surviving more than 900 years of turbulent history it has almost been destroyed by invading insects. Biblical plague: The infestation has gotten so bad that the roof of the church is threatening to cave in . Terrible termites: Even though they only grow to be seven millimetre long (0.3in) the deathwatch beetle can do extensive damage . Big dinner: The church is now forced to pay £300,000 in repair bills after the full extent of the damage was discovered in the rafters . Rebuilding: Part of the payout has been med by the National Lottery, but there is still nearly £200,000 missing for the South Wales church . The first church-goers knew of the infestation was the tapping noise made by the beetles as they feasted on the ancient wood. But church bosses realised just in time that the building was riddled with the tiny bugs. They begged the Heritage Lottery Fund for help and were given a grant of £180,300 to save the historic building from collapse. But repairs to the 12th century church - which retains many of its medieval features - could cost up to £300,000. Cheeky bug-ger: Deathwatch beetles can destroy a whole home as they eat their way through wooden structures . Bet they were hungry: Further damage caused to a part of the church after the infestation . The tiny deathwatch beetle is just 7millimetres (0.3in) long, but can cause extensive damage to wooden structures. t has gotten its name from the tapping noise it makes to attract a mate, which would be heard from inside the rafters of cabins and wooden buildings. The quiet noise is associated with the 'death watch', or death vigil, kept beside the bed of a dying loved one, and old superstition see the beetle as an omen of impending death.","St Barrwg's Church near Caerphilly, is being 'eaten' by deathwatch beetles .

Government . forces celebrated late Tuesday the recapture of Bor from forces loyal . to Machar after the army stormed the strategic town, but battles raged . elsewhere including in Malakal, capital of oil-producing Upper Nile . state. Overwhelmed: At least 20,000 people are sheltering at two UN bases in the capital Juba, while 17,000 are taking refuge in the UN base in the rebel-held town of Bor . Information Minister Michael Makwei denied rebel claims that they had seized it. ‘There . is fighting now in Malakal since morning between the government forces . and the rebels,’ Makwei told AFP. ‘It is not true that the rebels have . taken over.’ An AFP . correspondent who visited Bor on Wednesday said that bodies littered the . streets and stores were looted, with occasional gun shots still ringing . out even as civilians poured back into the town to return home.

Humanitarian crisis: A woman and child sit in the shade next to a box of food assistance they have received in the UN compound where they have sought shelter in Juba, South Sudan . The . UN humanitarian chief in the country, Toby Lanzer, said on Tuesday there . was ‘absolutely no doubt in my mind that we're into the thousands’ of . dead, the first clear indication of the scale of the conflict engulfing . the world's youngest country. Earlier, . UN rights chief Navi Pillay said a mass grave had been found in the . rebel-held town of Bentiu and cited reports of at least two more in . Juba. However, the United Nations mission in South Sudan denied this. The . Berlin office of Navi Pillay had said on Tuesday that a grave of 75 . bodies was found in Bentiu, Unity State. Later, the office revised that . figure to 34 bodies and 75 people feared missing. The . U.N. mission in South Sudan said the erroneous report was an inflation . of a ‘skirmish’ in which 15 people were killed. UNMISS said it is still . deeply concerned about extrajudicial killings and is investigating those . reports. The official toll nationwide has stood at 500 dead for days, but aid workers have said the number killed was likely far higher. Pope Francis called on Wednesday for ‘social harmony’ and warned the violence was ‘threatening peaceful coexistence’. Witnesses recount a wave of atrocities, including an orchestrated campaign of mass killings and rape. ‘There . are now people who are targeting others because of their tribal . affiliation,’ Kiir said in a Christmas message to the country, where the . population is roughly divided between Christians, Muslims and . traditional beliefs. ‘It will only lead to one thing and that is to turn . this new nation into chaos.’ Government . forces have also said they are preparing to take back the town of . Bentiu, capital of South Sudan's most important oil region Unity state, . now in the hands of a powerful army commander who mutinied last week to . join Machar. Oil production, . which accounts for more than 95 percent of South Sudan's fledgling . economy, has been dented by the violence, with oil workers evacuated. Bor's . recapture, without major resistance by the rebels, lifted a nearly . week-long seige of the town, where some 17,000 civilians fled into the . overstretched UN compounds for protection, severely stretching limited . food and supplies. ‘Most of the rebels who were in the town are on the run,’ Makwei said. Relieved: A Kenyan woman holds a baby after being evacuated from South Sudan by the Kenyan Defence Forces at Wilson Airport in Nairobi, Kenya . UN . peacekeepers had spent days bolstering fortifications ahead of the army . assault, after militia gunmen last week stormed a UN compound in the .

The unrest has taken on an ethnic dimension, pitting Kiir's Dinka tribe against Machar's Nuer. Machar . said he was ready to accept Kiir's offer of talks, following days of . shuttle diplomacy by African nations and calls from Western powers for . an end to the fighting. ‘We want democratic, free and fair elections. We want Salva Kiir to call it a day,’ Machar said, listing his demands on Tuesday. Turmoil: The UN said at least 45,000 civilians have sought protection at its badly overstretched bases amid brutal fighting that has spread to half of the nation's 10 states . US .

The Russian-built ship, MV Akademik Shokalskiy, has about 50 passengers and 20 crew members on board but apart from frustrations all were said to be safe. The ice-strengthened ship, built in 1982, was originally used for oceanographic research before being refurbished to be used as a passenger vessel in the Arctic and Antarctica. There are around 70 passengers and crew stuck on the MV Akademik Shokalskiy after it got stuck in ice in the Antarctic . Australia's Maritime Safety Authority, which is now controlling the rescue operation, received a distress call early today saying that the vessel was trapped in thick ice and would need help to move. Until rescue vessels arrive, it will not be known whether the passengers would have to be taken off the ship and moved out of the area on larger vessels. It was not immediately known how long the ship has been trapped, surrounded by ice floes. A spokeswoman for the safety authority told Australia's Associated Press that three ships were on their way to the stricken vessel. But it will be at least two days before the nearest ship will be able to reach the remote location, some 1,500 nautical miles south of Hobart. 'It is quite a remote part of the world,' said the spokesman. 'But we have everyone safe. The vessel isn't in any immediate danger.' The spokeswoman said the ship was on a research expedition to commemorate the centenary of Australian geologist Douglas Mawson's exploration of Antarctica. The vessel was visiting a number of sites along the edge of Antarctica. The nationalities of the tourists have not been revealed, but they are known to include scientists and explorers.

Stefanie Lackner, 46, a realtor married to the CEO of Fisher Island Club resort Bernard Lackner, pleaded guilty last week to misdemeanor petit larceny in connection to a shoplifting incident that took place in August 2012 at the high-end Madison Avenue boutique Brunello Cuccinelli. According to court documents, Mrs Lackner entered the store located a few blocks from her office at the real estate firm Douglas Elliman and picked up a sweater priced at $5,135. Sticky fingers: Socialite Stefanie Lackner, pictured here with her hotelier husband Bernard in 2004, has been sentenced to 30 days in jail for stealing a $5,000 sweater from a boutique . Epitome of luxury: The shoplifting incident took place inside the swanky Brunello Cuccinelli boutique on Madison Avenue . The blonde real estate agent initially took the garment to a fitting room to try it on. She then requested the sweater in a different size while holding onto the original. The criminal complaint cited by the New York Post states that when Lackner emerged from the dressing room, she was carrying only one sweater, but a black shopping bag she had in her possession was noticeably bulging. The crime was described by a police officer who reviewed surveillance footage from inside the store. 'The defendant did then exit the store without paying for the remaining sweater,' the court papers state. Mrs Lackner was arrested in November 2012 and initially faced a charge of felony grand larceny, which was later downgraded as part of a plea deal. When contacted by the Post for comment, Lackner's manager at Douglas Elliman said he was not aware of the broker's legal troubles.

One 15-year old boy with cerebral palsy got a very special Christmas gift this year--the ability to communicate with his family with words for the first time in his entire life. Raymond Lara, a high school student from Central California, gathered with friends at the American Legion Hall on H street on Monday night to accept his gift of a hands free eye-gaze communication device from the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Raymond suffers from cerebral palsy, a disease that keeps him from speaking, eating anything through his mouth, even swallowing his own saliva, reports the Huffington Post. Santa Claus gives an eye-gaze communication system courtesy of the Make-A-Wish-Foundation of Central California to 15-year-old Raymond Lara and his family . Raymond has never said the words, 'I love you.' but his mother can read the emotion in his eyes. The machine also relies on the user's eyes in order to create a tool for communicating thoughts and feelings with words---or in the case of the machine, menu choices. The machine employs imaging technology that creates a computer portrait of the user's eye. After calculating the location of the user's gaze on the computer screen it allows the user to hold his or her gaze on a menu option. Raymond is able to create words and sentences by holding his point of view on a specific option or menu choice. Using the machine has been an extraordinary challenge for Raymond because he suffers from nystagmus, a condition characterized by involuntary eye movement. The machine operates by locating where the eye is looking. Since Raymond suffers from involuntary eye movements he has had to endure copious amounts of therapy in order to learn how to use the machine properly. His teacher David Mensch along with others at Centennial High School's Special Education program have helped him control his eye movements enough so that he use the machine to its fullest. With practice, Raymond has been able to control his eye movements so that he can use the communication device which relies on taking a digital portrait of his eyes in order to help him communicate verbally . Duane Law, CEO or Kearn Regional Center that assists thousands of disabled residents in Kearn and all over the world spoke highly of the communication technology that is still in development. 'It's an extraordinarily liberating thing, ' said Kern. 'Raymond's family not only believes he can communicate, but that he can communicate everyday. At one time, Ray couldn't tell his family he needed to go to the bathroom. He couldn't make jokes or express his complex thoughts in a way that his family and others could understand. Ray cannot read, so for now his use of the machine is with pictures. He can recognize images pertaining to the bathroom, hunger, or thirst. With time, his use of the machine will become mature as he matures. He's a teen: Raymond's menu options reflect his youthful personality and he can say things like, 'hey pretty lady' Gifted: Raymond's father thinks the device will help his son to learn and that he may end up to be the next Stephen Hawking . 'There are times when something is wrong, and he tries to get our . attention,' said his mother to the Bakersfield Californian. 'We know he needs something. What we've always . done is try to guess.' Unfortunately, after months of learning how to use the communication device, Ray's family cold not afford to pay the $6,000 it would cost to keep the machine . The family tried to get coverage for the machine under their insurance company for over a year but were continuously denied. The Make-A-Wish Foundation decided to grant Raymond's wish to keep the machine so that he could build relationships with those around him. 'We call it the power of wish' said Catherine Anspach, a spokeswomen for the Make-A-Wish foundation in central California. Raymond was overcome with joy on Monday night when he unwrapped his eye-gaze machine. Raymond is 15 years old and his parents say that his menu choices on the machine reflect his youthful energy. 'He's kind of a little flirt,' his mom said, laughing. 'He has one that says, 'Hey, pretty lady.' 'The system will grow with Raymond,' his teacher David Mensch said. 'The more he learns, the more it will grow with him.' Raymond's father Roman Lara III, greatly supports his son's progress. 'Raymond has a lot of love to share with the world,' he said. 'Who knows, we may have another Stephen Hawking here,' he told the Huffington Post. His father also can't wait for his son to say things like, 'go Broncos.' The family keeps a blog to document Raymond's progress called ourlifewithraymond.blogspot.com for those who wish to read more.

The Ezell family are already looking forward to next Christmas, when Santa should only have to make one stop. Owen and Emmett were born in July joined from the chest to the belly button, with shared intestines and a liver. But after successful surgery in August, the pair were able to spend their first Christmas in the world as two separate people - and parents David and Jenni would never have missed the celebration regardless. Dressing the boys up in adorable Santa suits, the couple shared from the Medical City Children's Hospital in Dallas, Texas, on their blog, while speaking of their excitement for Christmas 2014. Their sons are due for another bout of surgery early next year and, if successful, could be home by summer. Santa's little fighters: Formerly conjoined twins Owen and Emmett Ezell - who continue to progress and recover from their separation surgery - may have spent their first Christmas in hospital in Dallas, but didn't miss any of the celebrations . The Ezell family have a lot to be thankful for this Christmas after their sons, Owen and Emmett, were born conjoined in July but successfully separated in August . Following another bout of surgery early next year, Parents Jenni and David Ezell are hoping to take their boys Owen and Emmett home by summer 2014 . Jenni Ezell and her husband Daze, from Guthrie, Oklahoma, were told during a routine sonogram earlier this year that their babies were joined at the abdomen . Next Christmas is going to be bedlam,' David Ezell told NBC News with a smile. 'It's going to be madness with all those little ones running around.' 'It's going to be great though. Bedlam in a good way.' Owen is currently 16 lbs., while Emmett is 15 lbs. Medical City Children's Hospital says the boys are alert, smiling and interacting with their family and Medical City staff. 'We're getting these rumblings that the boys are getting better and it's not long before we get to bring them home and you know, it's all worth it,' David said. 'At this point we're as glad as we can be to have gone through it because now we're here.' These comments are at complete odds with the situation they were in back in March, after finding out while pregnant their twins shared vital organs only had a five per cent chance of living a healthy life if separated. The heartbroken parents considered a termination. Successful: This photo shows one of the twins shortly after the 11-hour operation which successfully separated them in August . We wanted to save them from the pain and hurt that they would feel,' Mr Ezell said at the time. However . the couple soon had a change of heart after a doctor convinced them . that their boys, who shared a liver and intestines, had a fighting . chance. A specialist at . Medical City Dallas renewed their faith, telling them: 'These boys have a . really good chance. This is not your only option.' Mrs . Ezell gave birth to conjoined boys Emmett and Owen on July 15. Doctors . advised that separation surgery was possible but risky - out of eight . similar operations, only once did both twins survive. The couple, who have two . other sons, moved to Dallas for the boys' medical care and were able to say goodbye before the boys were taken into surgery. 'As a mother, I hope I never have to . experience a moment like that again,' Mrs Ezell wrote in her 'Ezell . Twins' blog.

Her husband added: 'A couple of pretty good looking babies, Iâ€™d say.' Owen and Emmett,  have remained at Medical City Children's Hospital in Dallas since they were born and will do so for several more months. They will need further surgeries in the future; after they are two, the boys will require 'skin expanders' for their wounds. Another operation will require surgeons to pull abdominal muscles into place, which should leave them with only a neat line of a scar. After this, if the parents wish, they can opt for the boys to have a third surgery to create a belly button for each of them. Marvel: An ultrasound shows the boys attached at the abdomen while in Jennie's womb . Early days: The babies shortly after their birth on July 15 . Roughly one out of every 200,000 live births worldwide results in conjoined twins, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center. Around 40 to 60 per cent of conjoined twins arrive stillborn, and about 35 per cent survive only one day. The survival rate is between 5 per cent and 25 per cent, the Center reported. The condition is three times more likely to occur among females than males and a third of conjoined twins are attached at the lower chest, sharing organs. Chances of successful surgery and survival are greater if the twins have separate sets of organs, experts say. Although success rates have improved over the years, surgical separation is still rare. Since 1950, at least one twin has survived separation about 75 percent of the time. After separation, most twins need intensive rehabilitation because of the malformation and position of their spines. Although risky, there are many stories of successful separations. Most recently, Utah twins Kendra and Maliyah Herrin, who were born sharing an abdomen, pelvis, liver, kidney, large intestine and two legs, just celebrated seven years since they were separated aged four. Their family said the girls, who are learning to walk with the aid of prosthetics, are the happiest and healthiest they have ever been.","Owen and Emmett Ezell, from Dallas, Texas, shared a liver and intestines when they were born .

But how does the real ancestry of the actors and actresses compare to the characters they play? With the help of genealogy experts, MailOnline can today shed light on the family histories of some of the biggest stars - and they are far closer to the fiction than you might imagine. Scroll down for video .

Bearing gifts of extra rations, Coca Cola and nylon stockings it is no wonder that American GIs were popular house guests among British families during the Second World War. With British soldiers away in Europe, war-hit families were issued with an urgent plea to invite their US colleagues to share their Christmas celebrations. Faced with the prospect of their guests bringing extra food with them, families jumped at the chance to welcome the Americans into their homes, with some 50 invitations being offered for every GI, or Government Issue. Festive cheer: With British soldiers away in Europe, war-hit families were issued with an urgent plea to invite their US colleagues to share their Christmas celebrations . Celebrations: Father Christmas hands out toys and games, including a set of building bricks, to children at a home for evacuees in Henley-on-Thames . For troops serving in a foreign land, far away from home, Christmas was a difficult time. Around 60,000 had reached Britain by December, with the majority being stationed in East Anglia, where they had been tasked with building airfields for American planes. As many soldiers and airmen as possible were given the day off, and advised to spend the day with British families, 'Filling the chairs left empty by British fighting men'. Posters were put up around bases bearing the message: 'GIs spend your Christmas at home with a British family'. The soldiers who took up the invitations were given special ration packs to share with their guests, containing sought-after items such as fruit juice, evaporated milk, bacon, coffee sugar, rice, peas and lard. Partying gift: A reveller says goodbye to a crew of GIs after a 1942 Christmas party thrown in their honour . Far from home: American troops settling into their accommodation hut in southern England . Time to relax: Two British-based GIs kick back with a well-earned beer . War and rationing had brought many changes to familiar festive rituals in Britain, and Christmas celebrations often had to be scaled down or adjusted as restrictions and shortages took hold. As even the most basic foods were scarce, festive luxuries were hard to come by. Gifts were often homemade and practical and childrenâ€™s toys often made from recycled materials. With the extra food on offer, perhaps it was not a surprise when so many invitations were extended that in 1942 a US camp commander revealed 'The ration is estimated at 50 invitations for every one soldier available.' Party time: US soldiers dancing at Rainbow Corner, the Red Cross club for American troops in London . All aboard: American soldiers driving through the streets of London in 1942. Their average salaries were more than five times that paid to British soldiers . He urged more GIs about to spend their first Christmas in Britain to come forward 'and accept some more of those invitations'. One GI recalled in historian Juliet Gardiner's book Overpaid, Oversexed, And Over Here: The American GI In World War II Britain, how he was invited to spend Christmas at the home of a woman in the Land Army. He had arrived on a bicycle, laden down with his rations of spam, powdered coffee, chocolate and soap, along with other items from his camp stores. 'We all sat down to a Christmas dinner and scene that might have made Charles Dickens the only true recorder', he said. New friends: British Major General Archibald Nye plays 'Oranges and lemons' with London children at a party for American soldiers in 1942 . Determined: The threat of bombs did not stop the crowds doing their Christmas shopping in the famous Petticoat Lane market, London during the war . 'I donâ€™t recall what we had for dinner, but at long last the plum pudding was served â€“ and I gained the silver sixpence.' Along with their rations the GIs were also responsible for bringing many festive traditions into British homes, including Christmas crackers, while in exchange the Brits introduced their guests to Advent calenders and Advent candles. As in peacetime, a prominent feature of a war-time Christmas was singing songs and carols, and from 1939 onwards the BBC's special Christmas Day radio programming would include a speech by the King, an event which became an annual ritual and continues to this day. The Americans would also help British families to forget their wartime woes by throwing lavish parties at their Army and Air bases, inviting local school children to join in their festivities. War orphans were the guests of honour when the US Army soldiers of the 3120th Signal Service Battalion held a party for the children at the Salvation Army War Emergency Home at Lady Templemore's estate at Alresford, Gloucestershire. Party time: For many young children away from home Christmas was a difficult time, especially for these evacuees who were cheered up by a visit from Father Christmas . For these young children Christmas could be a particularly difficult time, as they were not only spending the holidays away from home, but they had also lost a parent - either in action, or as a result of enemy bombing raids. One former guest of a party in Middlesbrough recalled how a Christmas party was thrown for school children in the Town Hall and the youngsters each given a gift from Santa - who had an American accent. 'The G.I.s had decorated the interior with lots of flags, Stars and Stripes and Union Jacks, together with tinsel and paper chains,' he said. 'They served an immense amount of food, not only the cakes, jellies and blancmange but many sweet dishes that we hadn't seen for ages due to rationing.' Keen to decorate their vast bases, the GIs would hang 'chaff', strips of metallic foil thrown from their aircraft to confuse German radar, from trees, as well as more traditional items like coloured lights and streamers. Lasting legacy: GI brides and their babies get ready to fly to America for Christmas 1946. Unfortunately, their flight was turned back because of bad weather. These women and their children had to wait for another opportunity to reach their new home. When the GIs arrived on British shores in 1942, bringing with them sought-after Coca Cola, cigarettes, chewing gum and nylons there was initially distrust between the Brits and the GIs. Their average salaries were more than five times that paid to British soldiers and their generosity made them particularly attractive to women. Around 70,000 British women became GI brides, although it was estimated that around 9,000 war babies were born out of wedlock as a result of the GIs liaisons. After the war the British GI wives were offered a free passage by the US Army to start their new lives in America, although the journey was not so simple for the group of women preparing to fly across the Atlantic for Christmas 1946. Four years after the first GIs found themselves far from home in the UK, the British women found themselves in the same predicament as their flight was turned back because of bad weather, and they had to wait for another opportunity to reach their new home. By the time the war was over around three million US soldiers had spent time in Britain, and were frequently described as being 'overpaid, oversexed and over here'.","American soldiers were encouraged to spend Christmas with Brits who saw them as Johnny come latelys to war .

Radical Islamic cleric Abu Qatada told a prosecutor to shut up and sit down after he lost his temper during a trial in Jordan . Radical Islamic cleric Abu Qatada told a prosecutor to shut up and sit down after he lost his temper during a trial in Jordan. The extremist was deported from Britain to face terrorism charges in his native Jordan. On his arrival in Amman, Jordanian prosecutors charged him with conspiring to carry out terror attacks in Jordan twice - once in 1999 for a foiled plot against the American school in the Jordanian capital, and another in 2000 for allegedly targeting Israeli and American tourists and Western diplomats during Jordan's Millennium celebrations. Earlier this month, he pleaded innocent for the Millennium terror plot. In the latest hearing he also pleaded 'not guilty' to the second terror charges. One military prosecutor said Abu Qatada's statement of support for al-Qaida will not be used as evidence against him because he did not address the court, but rather expressed his opinion. The proceedings began after the tribunal replaced one military judge with a civilian, making the three-man tribunal all civilian judges as requested by Qatada. The cleric previously said the presence of a military judge violated an agreement with Britain that paved way for his extradition and meant to guarantee him a fair trial in his homeland. While in the dock, he challenged the impartiality of the tribunal several times, raising his voice at the judges and insulting military prosecutors. He asked the court's presiding judge at one moment: 'You listen: Do you think you are a fair judge?'Col. Fawaz Atoum, the prosecutor, demanded he be removed from the court. Locked up: Mawaqqar 1 Prison Jordon where Abu Qatada is being held on terrorist charges . Qatada then turned to Col. Atoum and said: 'Shut up and sit down.' Qatada has also appealed to al-Qaida fighters in Syria to unite their ranks and end infighting. The 53-year-old spoke during his latest hearing before a military court in the Jordanian capital Amman. He appealed to the two main al-Qaida factions in Syria - the Nusra Front and the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant - to offer 'unequivocal submissiveness' to al-Qaida's chief, Ayman al-Zawahri. 'Our brave Jihadists in Syria should unite their ranks and be obedient to Dr Ayman to prevail in the war,' he said when asked for his opinion by a Muslim scholar in the packed courtroom. Qatada, real name Omar Mahmoud Mohammed Othman, is on trial for plotting attacks against Israelis, Americans and other Westerners in Jordan in two foiled attempts in 1999 and 2000. Jordan convicted him in his absence and sentenced to life in prison. But under Jordanian law he had to be retried once he returned following his deportation in July. The cleric has been described in courts as a senior al-Qaida figure in Europe who had close ties to Osama bin Laden. Britain accused him of links with Zacarias Moussaoui, the only person charged in the United States over the September 11 attacks, and with shoe bomber Richard Reid. Audio recordings of some of the cleric's sermons were found in an apartment in Hamburg, Germany, used by some of the hijackers. The trial will resume in January 16.","Extremist deported from Britain to face terrorism charges in Jordan .

Seven months after Leanda Loosemore’s dog Annah was stolen, she was found bedraggled but unharmed, 500 miles from where she’d disappeared. After the show dog was kidnapped from outside her home in Newburgh, Scotland, Miss Loosemore spent months appealing on the internet to try to trace her  Shetland sheepdog. Leanda Loosemore (left) has been reunited with her dog, Annah, after she went missing seven months ago . But she had given up all hope of ever seeing the dog again when a call came from Kent, saying Annah was safe, well and ready to come home. The incredible reunion took place because Annah had been fitted with a pet microchip containing her owner’s details. Rather than have Miss Loosemore, 25, travel all the way to Kent, staff at the rescue centre that were caring for Annah agreed to meet her in the Midlands – at a dog show she was attending in Birmingham. The hand-over took place around ten days later, shortly before Christmas. It was a moment the mother of two will never forget. She said: ‘I was doing my best not to cry, but it was amazing. It was a massive, massive relief when I  actually got my hands on her and picked her up. ‘I had been putting stuff on Facebook for months, but I had given up about six weeks before that. I thought: That’s it. I am not going to get her back now. ‘So it was unbelievable when I heard she had been found.’ The six-year-old bitch was on a lead outside her home near Newburgh, close to St Andrews in Fife, when thieves crept in through a broken fence and took her. Annah, whose pups sell for up to £800, was next seen 521 miles away, wandering the outskirts of Ashford, Kent. She was picked up by council workers and taken to the local dog pound, where she was traced back to Fife through her microchip. Miss Loosemore believes Annah was stolen for breeding purposes and cast aside by the thieves when the plan wasn’t successful, or  perhaps that she escaped from new owners who had bought her from the dognappers. Although she was dirty when picked up and her fur was matted, Annah was still healthy and had been properly cared for during her seven months of captivity. She had even put on weight. ‘Whoever had her did look after her. She’s not nervous or scared of anything, it’s as if she has never been away. She’s back to her usual happy self.’ Miss Loosemore, who is a trainee beautician with children aged three and five, has nine show dogs in total, including Annah’s sons and brother, but it is Annah who has been the household’s favourite this Christmas. ‘The kids were really excited to get Annah back. On the whole they love each dog equally but because of the hype of her going away and coming back it’s Annah they want all the time. ‘They are really happy to have her back.’ Mark James, a spokesman for Ashford council, said Annah was taken in after being spotted by a builder in a field. He added: ‘We are pleased that there was a happy outcome to this story and that Annah is now safe and enjoying home comforts once again.’","Leanda Loosemore's dog kidnapped from outside her home in Scotland .

In a recent investigation he was deemed a ‘threat to the riding public’ by the Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), which struck him off.

He asked whether she had a boyfriend and whether she was going to his house. After the unnamed woman lied that she was with someone, Baig enquired as to whether she would be sleeping with him that night. She told investigators that she was left feeling ‘violated’, the report states. Baig told the passenger that they should ‘get together’ and by the time he reached the woman’s house she felt so intimidated that she gave him a 20 per cent tip to keep him calm, even though he refused to help with her luggage.

An armed gang who smashed their way into a supermarket tycoon’s country home and threatened his wife and daughter before stealing £220,000 worth of jewellery have been jailed. Armed with a sledgehammer, a sword and a handgun in the early hours, three masked men broke into the gated property of Colin Graves, who founded the Costcutter chain of convenience stores. His wife Sharon was woken by the trio in her bedroom and forced at gunpoint to lie on the landing while they opened the family’s safe. Zak Price (left), 23, wielded a gun while Jack Menzies (right), 22, raided the safe of Colin Graves . Maidstone Crown Court was told by Judge Jeremy Carey that she is ‘a woman of commendable steel’ because she did not panic and avoided causing the incident to escalate into violence. Mr Graves, 65, the executive chairman of Yorkshire County Cricket Club, was in Barbados. The gang threatened Mrs Graves, 53, and her daughter Francesca, 16,  before fleeing the property in Edenbridge, Kent, which has tennis courts, stables and an indoor swimming pool. Dominic Connolly, prosecuting, said: ‘It seems they knew where to look, they didn’t go to any other places. They seemed to be able to operate the rather complicated lighting system.’ Ringleader David Milner, 34, of Biggin Hill, Kent, was sentenced to ten years and Zak Price, 23, of Tonbridge, Kent, to eight years and three months. Jack Menzies, 22, of Eltham, South East London, was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years and getaway driver Aaron Wall, 22, of Sevenoaks, Kent, to four years and eight months. Milner and Menzies were convicted by a jury last month, after  a nine-day trial, of possessing a  firearm with intent to commit  a robbery. All four men had previously admitted robbery. Price and Wall had also previously entered guilty pleas to the firearms offence. Wall, who is profoundly deaf, received a lesser sentence because he gave evidence against the other three, although he diluted some of the statements he gave to police.  Judge Carey said Wall would be at risk in prison because he would be regarded as a ‘grass’. He told Milner: ‘As the ringleader, you attract the longest sentence.’ Fearsome: This is the handgun used by the gang to terrify Sharon Graves in her bedroom . The court had heard that Mrs Graves was ordered from her bed at gunpoint at 2am on March 19 by Price while Milner and Menzies stole the jewellery and watches from a safe. Wall was waiting nearby in a rented 4X4 Chevrolet Captiva. When the trio left the house, Mrs Graves was instructed to lie face down and count to 30. When she thought they had gone, she telephoned police. A patrol car racing to the scene passed the  getaway car travelling at high speed in the opposite direction. Officers, acting on instinct, did a U-turn and followed the 4X4 to the Tonbridge area, where Price got out. Despite the risk of him being armed, officers chased on foot and caught him. The Chevrolet was found abandoned later that morning in Tonbridge. It had been hired in Milner’s name and address. A search of the vehicle uncovered a sledgehammer receipt that matched a sledgehammer dropped as the gang fled across fields to the getaway car. Wall was arrested three days later. Menzies handed himself in while  Milner went on the run for 20 days before also handing himself in. Police said Milner had befriended the Graves’s housekeeper and abused the friendship to gain knowledge of the layout of the house. The firearm was found two weeks later and identified as an imitation of a Sig Sauer handgun, which fired ball bearings. Maidstone Crown Court (pictured) was told by Judge Jeremy Carey that she is 'a woman of commendable steel' because she did not panic and avoided causing the incident to escalate into violence . Speaking after sentencing on Monday, Detective Constable Don Share, from Kent Police, said: ‘It is difficult to imagine the fear that the mother and her daughter felt during this crime and that has been reflected within the sentence. ‘Anyone who possesses a firearm should expect to go to prison for  a long time, even more so should they commit a violent robbery such as this.’ Police said a small amount of jewellery was recovered from pawnbrokers across South London, but the majority was never found. Mr Graves set up Costcutter in 1986 after quitting as sales director of convenience store chain Spar. He sold a 49 per cent stake in Costcutter, which has 1,700 stores, to Bibby Line Group in 2007 and the remaining 51 per cent to the same company in 2011.","Gang, armed with sledgehammer, sword and handgun, broke into gated property of Costcutter founder Colin Graves .

"By . Peter Allen . UPDATED: . 12:28 EST, 18 December 2013 . Mark Fournier, 36, and another man performed Nazi salutes during his stag do in the ski resort of Val Thorens in France . A French prosecutor today demanded the maximum fine possible for an Oxford graduate who wore a Nazi uniform at a stag night partly organised by Tory MP Aidan Burley. Mark Fournier, 36, is accused of a dressing up as an SS officer at a restaurant in the upmarket ski resort of Val Thorens. But his defence lawyer told the tribunal in nearby Albertville should show him mercy because Prince Harry once got away with wearing an Afrika Korps uniform and swastika insignia at a party. He also said it was 'deeply unfair' that MP Mr Burley had organised the Nazi uniform, but not been prosecuted like his client. Mr Burley, the 34-year-old MP for Cannock Chase in Staffordshire, was with 12 friends, some of whom chanted 'Hitler, Hitler, Hitler'. One toasted the 'Third Reich' and one taunted a waiter for being French during the high-spirited evening in December 2011. Mr Burley lost his job as parliamentary private secretary to Britain's transport minister after pictures of the stag night appeared in the media. But it was the stag, Fournier, who was prosecuted for wearing a uniform of an organisation found guilty of crimes against humanity - something which is illegal in France. Mr Fournier initially faced more serious charges including the denial of war crimes and crimes against humanity, and of inciting racial hatred. After prosecutors called for a fine equivalent to some £1200 - the maximum possible for such an offence - Mr Fournier's lawyer Michel Roubaud said Prince Harry had got away with wearing his Nazi uniform in 2005. Mr Roubaud said: 'English law does not consider the wearing of a Nazi uniform to be a crime in itself. We can see that from the behaviour of Prince Harry. 'My client's behaviour was not ideologically motivated. It was organised by his best man, the MP, and took place in the context of a boozy stag party. He asked his MP friend if it was against the law to wear a Nazi uniform in France and he told him ""no"".' Probe: Tory Mp Aidan Burley, pictured right with Prime Minister David Cameron, was said to have arranged the costume for the party . Mr Burley sat next to Mark Fournier, an accountant who went to the stag party dressed as an SS officer . Mr Roubaud argued that it was 'deeply unfair' that Mr Burley had not been prosecuted alongside his friend given his role in organising the uniforms. Olivier Fernex de Mongex, speaking on behalf of an organisation that represents Holocaust victims and survivors, said Mr Fournier's behaviour had been extremely offensive. 'You cannot classify these acts as a schoolboy joke,' said Mr De Mongex, whose organisation is seeking the equivalent of £880 in damages plus interest from Fournier as part of a civil action brought alongside the criminal prosecution. A verdict in the case is expected in January. Mr Burley was filmed paying the bill for the meal at the exclusive restaurant in Val Thorens ski resort in France . Mr Burley was forced to apologise after pictures of the stag party emerged. He also agreed to the visit to Auschwitz to make amends for the distasteful party .","Mark Fournier is alleged to have dressed up as a SS officer at his stag do .

Wrapped in a football scarf and blanket in his north London care home, train robber Ronnie Biggs is pictured just days before he died. The sad image shows the decline of the notorious figure, who died in the early hours of Wednesday. Biggs had suffered with ill-health for years, which led to his return to Britain in May 2001 after decades on the run in Brazil after playing his part in the infamous Great Train Robbery of 1963. Scroll down for video . Decline: Ronnie Biggs, shown in his north London care home just days before his death . He had suffered three strokes while abroad, leaving him in need of medical care which he could not afford. He contacted Scotland Yard to arrange handing himself in, and struck a deal with The Sun newspaper, which flew him back to England, where he was arrested on arrival. After serving eight years on his jail sentence, he was released in 2009 by Jack Straw, then the Justice Secretary, on 'compassionate grounds'. He was seen again in public this year giving a defiant gesture to the cameras at a funeral for his friend and fellow train robber Bruce Reynolds, who was said to be the mastermind of the heist. Despite his later fame, the notorious fugitive had little or no prowess as a villain, having made so many mistakes the police found it very easy to find and arrest him. After stealing pencils at 15 and a series of botched robberies after that, by the time he was asked to take part in the crime of the century he already had nine convictions in 13 years. Small-time villain: Biggs in a police mugshot from 1963, left, and defiant to the last at a funeral earlier this year . However in 1963 his life would change forever, and he would become world famous for his part in the most celebrated robbery in the history of British crime. His subsequent escape and high-profile life in Rio de Janeiro brought him the notoriety he would revel in even up until to his death. But at the age of 71, and in failing health after three strokes, Biggs announced he was ending his 35-year exile. He was penniless and needed vital medical treatment in Britain which he could not afford in Brazil.Ignoring protests from his family, including son Michael who begged him to reconsider, he sent an email to Scotland Yard informing them that he wanted to give himself up and needed a passport. Explaining his reasons for turning himself in, Biggs said: 'I am a sick man. My last wish is to walk into a Margate pub as an Englishman and buy a pint of bitter. 'I hope I live long enough to do that.' The wish was never fulfilled. Old age: Biggs with his son Michael who paid tribute to his father and said he hoped to bury his ashes in Brazil . Arrest: Biggs pictured after being apprehended by police in the wake of robbery . He was immediately arrested on his arrival in this country and found himself back in a dock later that day, a dribbling husk of the cocky cockney villain he had been last time he faced a judge. The formalities of returning an escapee to justice were swiftly dealt with, and he was transferred to the high-security Belmarsh Prison to continue serving the sentence he had put on hold three-and-a-half decades earlier. Lambeth-born Ronald Arthur Biggs had been, essentially, a small-time crook who suddenly and unexpectedly found himself in the big league. He was born on August 8, 1929, and his first court appearance came as a 15-year-old in January 1945 - for stealing pencils from Littlewoods. He would later join the gang which held up the Royal Mail night train from Glasgow to London on his 34th birthday, August 8, 1963 - the Great Train Robbery. Old age: Biggs shown launching his memoirs in 2011, when he was afflicted with illness . Biggs's role was to find a driver for the train. In fact, the driver he found had problems with the controls and the train's legitimate driver, 57-year-old Jack Mills, was coshed with iron bars and forced to move the train. He died seven years later. The gang seized a cargo of used banknotes worth around Â£2.6 million, a huge sum at the time. The hold-up, at Sears Crossing in Buckinghamshire, was planned in minute detail and, initially at least, was a spectactular success. But the police later caught up with the robbers, and eleven members of the gang received jail sentences ranging from 14 to 30 years. Sentenced to 30 years' behind bars on April 15, 1964, Biggs was to serve just 15 months in prison. Taunting: Ronnie Biggs, who has died at the age of 84, pictured while on the run in Brazil . On July 8, 1965, he made a daring escape from Wandsworth prison. While other prisoners created a diversion in the exercise yard, Biggs scaled a wall with a rope ladder and dropped onto a furniture van parked alongside. After a brief stopover in Paris for Â£40,000 worth of plastic surgery to change his appearance, he travelled to Australia, entering the country on a false passport using an assumed name. He would then head to Australia, and was sighted in Hong Kong, South Africa and Japan before being tracked down in Brazil, where the authorities found it impossible to bring him in. Calling himself Michael Haynes, Biggs carved out a new career as a jobbing carpenter in Rio de Janeiro. He would also supplement his income by selling T-shirts and posing for photos with tourists, and later put out his autobiography, Odd Man Out. He suffered his first stroke in 1998, though he recovered to throw a 70th birthday party. However, the second and third strokes followed, permanently ending his days of beaches and parties, and starting the chain of events that led to his return to Britain. He would be taken from prison to a hospital in London barely a month after his 2001 return. At times he was fed through a drip, and needed several urgent operations. By 2009 his health had deteriorated further, and he was released from custody to live out his remaining years.","Sad image shows Biggs in his north London care home before he died .

Brave: A sketch of Bing the parachuting dog who fought in the Second World War and was decorated for his bravery in action against the Nazis . Britain's parachuting dogs of war are honoured in a new book which tells the story of how man's best friend was enlisted into the ranks of the army to help defeat the Nazis. 13 - Lucky for Some: The History Of The 13th (Lancashire) Parachute Battalion by Andrew Woolhouse chronicles how these 'paradogs' became hero-hounds in the service of their country. Brian was one of them.  He learned how to sniff out mines, didn't flinch under gunfire and eagerly threw himself out of planes thousands of feet in the air. And on D-Day, the greatest invasion in history when the Allies left the shores of Britain to retake occupied Europe from the Nazis, he dropped under heavy ack-ack to be the first four-legged liberator on French soil. After the war the young Alsatian-Collie mix was given a medal recognising his 'conspicuous gallantry.'  He was one of the most unique units ever formed by the British army in wartime. The Russians, early in the Second World War and overwhelmed by the Nazi war macine, trained dogs with mines on their backs to crawl under German panzers and sacrifice themselves for the Soviet Union. But Britain wanted its canine comrades alive - to find minefields, keep a watchful eye out for the enemy and even to attack sentries. Woolhouse, an amateur historian, believes the battalion got Brian in early 1944 because Lance Corporal Ken Bailey 'had a veterinary background.' L/Cpl Bailey initially ran the 'War Dog Training School' in Hertfordshire, a Hogwarts for hounds that were meant to help the war effort. Brian, who was renamed Bing by the paras, joined Alsatians Monty and Ranee, the latter being the only bitch to parachute for the army during the war. Training was tough, recounts Woolhouse. At the base in Larkhill Garrison the dogs were forced to sit four hours on transport aircraft with propellors running at full pitch. They learned to sniff out explosives - TNT, cordite, ammonal - and how to keep low to the ground when live ammo was flying all around. The dogs were fitted with parachutes originally designed to drop bicycles for troops. Starved of food and drink before jumps, the dogs were lured out of the aircraft with chunks of meat. On April 2, 1944, Bailey wrote in his notebook about his first jump with Ranee. 'After my chute developed,' he wrote, 'I turned to face the line of flight; the dog was 30 yards away and slightly above. The chute had opened and was oscillating slightly. Ranee looked somewhat bewildered but showed no sign of fear. I called out and she immediately turned in my direction and wagged her tail vigorously. 'The dog touched down 80 feet before I landed. She was completely relaxed, making no attempt to anticipate or resist the landing, rolled over once, scrambled to her feet and stood looking round. I landed 40 feet from her and immediately ran to her, released her and gave her the feed.' Hero: Lance Corporal Jason Grime and Corporal Kevin Waterhouse pose next to the life-sized model of Bing . On D-Day, June 6 1944, three aircraft carrying the 13th Battalion paras and their three dogs were sent to Normandy. Bing, who would go on to win a medal, had to be thrown out of the plane by the jump master after Bailey had jumped. He landed in a tree where he hung suspended for two hours before his two-legged comrades rescued him.  He had cuts to his face from shrapnel from German mortars. But Bing and the other dogs went to work and were invaluable in sniffing out mines. 'They would sniff excitedly over it for a few seconds and then sit down looking back at the handler with a quaint mixture of smugness and expectancy,' Bailey wrote, noting that the dogs would then be rewarded with a treat. 'The dogs also helped on patrols by sniffing out enemy positions and personnel, hence saving many Allied lives.' Monty was severely wounded on D-Day, while Ranee was separated from her battalion shortly after landing in Normandy and never seen again. But they were later replaced by two German army German shepherds who switched sides. Bing survived the war and went on to receive the Dicken Medal, the UK's highest honor for animals that have displayed 'conspicuous gallantry or devotion to duty while serving with any branch of the Armed Forces or Civil Defence Units.' When he died in 1955, the former paradog was buried in a cemetery of honor for animals northeast of London. A life-sized model of him can be found in the Parachute Regiment and Airborne Forces Museum in Duxford... wearing his parachute.","Dogs were trained as bomb sniffers and lookouts for British troops .

Rosenberg also penned details of his meetings with fellow Nazi henchman Hermann Goering where they discussed 'ethno-psychological foreign policy'. Rosenberg was convicted of war crimes at the Nuremberg trials after World War II and executed in 1946. Holocaust Memorial Museum Director Sara J. Bloomfield said on Tuesday that the diary will help in understanding the ideas that led to the extremist ideology of Nazism. The Holocaust Memorial Museum has posted scans of the newly acquired . diary pages on its website, with accompanying German transcripts. An official English translation is not yet available. The Holocaust Memorial Museum has not provided official English translations. According to basic translations online, some diary excerpts reveal details of Rosenberg's lunches with Hitler and his trips across Germany to stir troops at the dawn of the Second World War: . April 27, 1936: Rosenberg says he spoke to 9,400 Nazis in Stuttgart, saying that they stand 'solidly behind me in my fight' 'After the Congress', 1937: The Nazi describes his battles against Catholicism and the Pope. May 21, 1939: Rosenberg discusses meeting with another high-ranking Nazi Hermann Goering where he developed his views on 'ethno-psychological foreign policy'. February 2, 1941: Rosenberg describes how he ate lunch with Hitler in Berlin where the Nazi leader reportedly said that sick children should not be given meat but fruit and vegetables. The henchman writes: 'He [Hitler] is convinced that plant eaters... the tenacious forces of life.' September 1, 1941: Rosenberg says that having been bed-ridden with periostitis - a chronic inflammation of the tissue around bones - he had time to consider the details of his ministry -  such as staffing and interviews. He adds that the future of Ukraine is a 'yet completely undecided problem'. According to the museum, the diary . contains details of Rosenberg's meetings with Hitler, squabbles among . senior Nazis and bombing raids on Germany. The long-lost diary was uncovered earlier this year in upstate New York after disappearing 70 years ago. The diary pages were found at a publishing business in Lewiston, New York. Officials say Rosenberg's diary was smuggled . into the U.S. after the war, most likely by Robert M.W. Kempner, a government lawyer during the Nuremberg trials. Born in Germany, Kempner had fled to America in the 1930s to escape the Nazis, only to return for post-war trials. Kempner . cited a few Rosenberg diary excerpts in his memoir, and in 1956 a . German historian published entries from 1939 and 1940. But the bulk of . the diary never surfaced. The lawyer died in 1993, and museum officials later took possession of some of his . extensive document collection. But the Rosenberg diary remained missing . until recently. 'One of . the enduring mysteries of the Second World War is what happened to the . Rosenberg diary,' said John Morton, director of U.S. Immigrations and . Custom Enforcement said in June. 'We have solved that mystery.' The search for the diary dates to 1996, when two of Kempner's . former legal secretaries approached a Holocaust museum official about . Kempner's collection of papers. Over . several years, museum officials assessed and took possession . of several documents from Kempner's collection, although some material . they initially viewed in 1997 at Kempner's Pennsylvania home were . missing when they went to retrieve the papers. Harrowing tales: A diary has been recovered which belonged to Hitler confidant Alfred Rosenberg with the chilling language of the fascist regime . Immigration and Customs Enforcement Deputy Director Daniel Ragsdale (left) transfers the Rosenberg Diary to Holocaust Memorial Museum Director Sara Bloomfield (right) during a ceremony on Tuesday . Officials later learned that the two secretaries and 'another gentleman from upstate New York' had taken the papers. The papers were found in the hands of . Herbert Richardson, an academic publisher in Lewiston who once worked for Mr . Kempner, according to The New York Times. Officials found the materials with the . help of a private investigator and former FBI agent. Acting . upon a warrant issued by a federal magistrate judge in Delaware, . authorities seized the diary in April. Gerhard . Weinberg, professor emeritus of history at the University of North . Carolina and a leading historian on the Nazi era, said in June that the diary could . shed new light on Rosenberg's role in administering the occupied eastern . territories, and his relationships with other high-ranking Nazi . officials. Evil workings: Reichsleader Alfred Rosenberg (left) and Reichsminister Dr Henrich Lammers with Adolf Hitler . Learning from the horrors of the past: Rosenberg's diary is now in the possession of the Holocaust Museum in DC . Museum officials . said the documents provide valuable information, as Rosenberg helped . orchestrate the looting of artwork and other valuables from . Nazi-occupied territory during that the time. 'Its . discovery will undoubtedly give scholars new insight into the politics . of Nazi leaders and fulfills a museum commitment to uncover evidence . from perpetrators of the Holocaust,' a web posting said. Rosenberg, a Nazi ideologue and . propagandist, was the author of The Myth of the Twentieth Century, a . 1930 book espousing the superiority of Aryan culture over the Jewish . race. Important find: Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director John Morton (second left) points to evidence as Henry Mayer (second right), senior adviser on archives at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, looks over pages of the 'Rosenberg Diary' during a June press conference . Rosenberg was instrumental in developing and promoting the notion of a German 'master race' superior to other Europeans and, above all, to non-Europeans and Jews. Born in 1893 into an ethnic German family in what is today Estonia, Rosenberg, who loathed Christianity and 'degenerate' modern art, doubled as Hitler's point man in occupied eastern Europe and Russia during WW2. He was also tasked by Hitler to oversee the systematic plundering of countless works of art throughout occupied Europe, many of which remain missing to this day. Captured by Allied troops at the end of the 1939-45 war, Rosenberg was convicted at Nuremberg of war crimes. He was executed on October 16, 1946 at the age of 53. He later led the Nazi Party's foreign affairs department and rose through the party hierarchy to become Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories in 1941. Among . early translated excerpts is a passage from 1941 in which Rosenberg . wrote proudly of a conference marking 'the first time in European . history that 10 European nations were represented at an anti-Jewish . conference with the clear program to remove this race from Europe. ...' Later that year, Rosenberg wrote of . reports that Russian leader Josef Stalin had ordered the 400,000 Volga . Germans 'to be dragged away to Siberia, i.e. to have them murdered. ...' 'Yesterday . I had a proposal drafted for communication by broadcast to Russia, . England and the USA that in case this mass murder is implemented, . Germany will punish the Jews of Central Europe for this.' Other . translated excerpts involve the 1936 Olympic games, including . Rosenberg's assertions that Britons were 'angry about the negroes from . the USA as they squeeze out the English during the Olympic Games'. Historic role: Robert M. W.

A man who was freed after serving 23 years in prison for a murder he did not commit suffered a serious heart attack a day after his release. David Ranta was rushed to a New York hospital Friday night where it was discovered that one of his arteries was blocked and another was partially closed. Ranta's attorney, Pierre Sussman, told the New York Times that his client received a stent and will have to undergo another surgical procedure. Scroll down for video . Free man: David Ranta kisses a family member after a judge freed him after he spent more than two decades behind bars over the death of Rabbi Chaskel Werzberger yesterday . Long walk to freedom: David Ranta leaves Brooklyn Supreme court in New York on Thursday after being set free . New life: David Ranta, (center),was cleared by Lieberman's revelations and other evidence that his conviction was unsafe . Unemployed drug addict Ranta was sentenced to 37-and-a-half-years in prison after being found guilty of the killing of Rabbi . Chaskel Werzberger in Williamsburg on February 8, 1990. Ranta was released Thursday after a judge overturned his conviction, which hinged on a false testimony and a line-up that was falsified by police. The newly freed man was staying in a hotel with his family following his release as he was easing into his new life after spending nearly a quarter of a century in a maximum security prison. On Friday night, the 58-year-old man felt pain in his back and shoulders and became very hot, according to Sussman. At first, Ranta's loved ones thought he was having a panic attack, but soon realized that it was more serious than that. â€˜The toll that his years in prison have taken on David is great,â€™ added Mr. Sussman. A child witness, whose evidence . saw a man locked away for 23 years for the murder of a New York rabbi he . didn't commit, has spoken of how police told him to identify the . wrongly accused man. Menachem Lieberman was 13 when he was shown a line-up of suspects accused of the murder of Rabbi Chaskel Werzberger in a diamond robbery that went wrong. His . decision to reverse his statement saw wrongly convicted David Ranta . released from a maximum security jail yesterday after 23 years behind . bars. Ranta was set free after a judge . overturned his conviction that hinged on a falsified witness testimony . and a line up that was manipulated by police. Now living in Montreal, the . 36-year-old last night spoke of how police told him to select Ranta . saying he should 'choose the one with the big nose'. In an interview with Anderson Cooper on CNN Lieberman . said: 'As I was walking into the room to the line-up, they told me I . should pick the guy with the biggest nose. I was too young back then to . realize that this was a set-up. I never saw a line up before - I thought . it was part of the process'. Unemployed drug addict Ranta was sentenced to 37-and-a-half-years in prison after being found guilty of the killing of Rabbi . Chaskel in Williamsburg on February 8, 1990. That . day a man attempted to rob a diamond courier and when it went wrong . hijacked Rabbi Chaskel's car - shooting him in the forehead and leaving . him for dead. The murder rattled the Hasidic Jewish community in Brooklyn . and prompted calls for swift justice for the perpetrator. ID parade: This is the line-up which led to David Ranta's life imprisonment. Menachem Lieberman last night told how police led him as a 13-year-old witness and told him to wrongly select Ranta . Guilt: Menachem Lieberman said he was haunted by guilt as Ranta remained behind bars for 23 years. He decided to speak out in 2011 and Ranta was freed yesterday . Then just a schoolboy, Lieberman was . one of the witnesses to the man's escape and his positive ID of Ranta . saw him get locked away in 1991. Over the years he realized that his selection had been influenced and . in 2011 - 20 years on - he decided he had to share those suspicions. 'As . years went by, I remembered someone had told me,' he told Cooper. 'The . more and more I saw on the news innocent people getting let free - I . started to think back to the trial I was involved in,' he explained. 'I . didn't tell anyone in the world but as I grew older and saw more and . more of these wrongful convictions it really bothered me. Two years ago I . decided I had to get it off my chest. 'An innocent man was in jail and is now set free - . the sad part is the killer never met justice. I feel I was set up as a . kid and I just wanted to do my part for justice.' Smiling: David Ranta was overjoyed on being freed after a reinvestigation of his case cast serious doubt on evidence used to convict him in the cold-blooded shooting of a Brooklyn rabbi in 1990 . Murdered: Rabbi Chaskel Werzberger, (center right), attends a wedding in the Williamsburg section of the Brooklyn borough of New York . The detective in the case Louis Scarcella still denies any wrongdoing and says there were no attempts to frame Ranta. However, other problems were discovered when the Conviction Integrity Unit looked into the case. Paperwork was found to be missing and other leads didn't seem to be investigated. One . key suspect was cocaine addict Joseph Astin. His wife testified in 1996 . he had admitted the murder to her on the day but he died two months . later. In all, this convinced the court it was time to release 58-year-old Ranta, a father-of-three. 'Sir, you are free to go,' state Supreme Court Justice Miriam Cyrulnik told Ranta at a Brooklyn courthouse yesterday. Relatives, including his youngest daughter who was an infant when he was jailed, erupted in tears and shouts of joy. Prosecutors had joined Ranta's . defense attorney, Pierre Sussman, in asking Cyrulnik to vacate Ranta's . conviction 'in the interest of justice.' Courtroom: David Ranta heard the decision to release him in court as his family wept with joy . 'The . evidence no longer establishes the defendant's guilt beyond a . reasonable doubt,' said Assistant District Attorney John O'Mara, the . chief of the conviction integrity unit. He left the court carrying the belongings he had kept in his prison cell. Asked by reporters outside what he would do, Ranta said, 'Get the hell out of here.' 'I'm overwhelmed. I feel like I'm under water, swimming. As I said from the beginning, I had nothing to do with this case.' His family were overcome with joy. 'I just want to get him in my hands and I'll be happy,' said his son, David Ranta Jr., 36, to the New York Post. Grief: Thousands carried the coffin bearing the remains of much-loved rabbi Chaskel Werzberger . Rabbi Chaskel was a much-loved member of his Brooklyn community. Thousands of people attended his . funeral, and the then Mayor David Dinkins offered a $10,000 reward for . any information that led to an arrest. When Ranta was arrested the police car carrying him to jail was surrounded with people chanting, 'Death penalty!'. Despite . the prosecution and the defense agreeing that conviction was not safe relatives of Werzberger were shocked that Ranta was released. 'For this to happen 23 years later is mind-boggling,' said Isaac Abraham to Fox News.

Fighting it: Tranmere Rovers footballer Joe Thompson and his girlfriend Chantelle Perry . When professional footballer Joe Thompson was hit by fatigue and discovered a lump in his neck his club's doctor urged him to get it checked out. The super-fit 24-year-old from Prestwich, feared he had glandular fever or an infection so was stunned when he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Mr Thompson, who plays for League One side Tranmere Rovers said: 'The moment I found out I had cancer I was just in complete shock. 'I genuinely thought it would have . just been an infection or glandular fever - it caught me off guard. I . mean I'm only 24 and I couldn't believe it was happening to me, I . honestly thought I was invincible, I eat healthily and exercise and I . don't really drink. But . after I found out it all clicked into place, the symptoms of that type . of cancer were exactly what I'd had. The tiredness is like no other, . it's not just a long day or a big work-out at the gym. 'I have to admit though, I was relieved to just have finally found out what was wrong with me. 'What . was comforting was that the doctors immediately said that if you had to . pick a cancer this would be it as it has such a high survival rate. 'It's just the 'c' word though isn't it, it's so scary, and we didn't really know many people who had been treated for it before.' After being diagnosed in October, Mr Thompson was transferred to The Christie Hospital in Manchester. He was then asked if he wanted to take part in the pioneering research trial of a new antibody drug, being led by Professor John Radford. With the support of his girlfriend, Chantelle Perry, 27, and their 15-month-old daughter Thailula, as well as footballers from across the leagues, Mr Thompson is determined to beat the disease. He said: 'It's definitely going to be a challenge and of course I get really down some days but what I need is people around me to take my mind off it because if I'm on my own for too long I just think about everything too much. Tranmere Rovers footballer Joe Thompson and his girlfriend Chantelle Perry with their daughter Thailula . 'I have my loved ones to keep me strong and I'm so lucky to have such a fantastic family. 'As a family we're all really close. On the day I was told I had cancer my daughter just instinctively knew there was something up and she wouldn't stop crying. It was so strange because the moment the doctor told us she knew something was wrong. 'I guess she just knew there was a twinkle in daddy's eye which wasn't there anymore. We all slept crammed on the sofa together that night because Lula wouldn't settle and she usually goes to sleep like clockwork.' After being diagnosed in October, Mr Thompson was transferred to The Christie Hospital in Manchester . He added that trialling the new drug is giving him an extra boost as he prepares to undergo a six-month course of treatment and chemotherapy. He said: 'Now I'm feeling very positive about the new research trial and after I had weighed up the pros and cons it was just a no-brainer really. 'It was just fortunate that the doctor was based at Christie's and I lived in Manchester.' Since Joe's news became public, family and friends have rallied around to provide support for the family. And sports stars including , United legend Bryan Robson, former Aston Villa star Stan Petrov, coach Alan Stubbs, ex-referee Mark Halsey and tennis player Ross Hutchins, who have all experienced living with cancer, have all sent messages of support to him. Mr Thompson said: 'It definitely made me feel so much more positive hearing from stars such as these. 'They have all been so nice and inspiring to me at such a difficult time. 'Bryan just told me to remain positive as half of the battle is in the mind. Their words have really helped me get through these past few months. 'Mark Halsey got in touch with me and sent me a book with a note saying you'll no doubt have days when you're tired and just want to chill so read this. 'I have got all of their numbers and they said I can contact them whenever I need to chat, don't feel any reluctancy and they'll be there to help. 'Everybody has just been so fantastic though, it was a shock but my family and teammates have all been there for me and it means so much.' Mr Thompson, who has played professionally for more than seven years and used to play for Rochdale, has high hopes of returning to training next season. He and Chantelle are doing everything they can to improve his fitness. And the couple are determined to raise awareness of the condition and to raise as much money as possible for The Christie. Mr Thompson said: 'There are so many success stories out there you wouldn't believe it. 'At first I got a little selfish and didn't want to talk about it. But now I know there is no point in hiding away, I'm not going to be reserved and I want to help others in a similar situation as much as I can.'","Joe Thompson, 24, plays for League One side Tranmere Rovers .

A photographer waited for three months in freezing temperatures to capture this dazzling display of light above the Rocky Mountains in a set of spectacular photographs. Ricahrd Gottardo, 29, camped in the -37C mountains throughout the Winter, hoping to photograph the breathtaking Northern Lights. He captured the natural phenomenon on April 13, just days before he was due to leave the expedition. Mr Gottardo, from Calgary, Canada, took the pictures in Revelstoke, British Columbia and hired a snowmobile to reach the perfect vantage point. While he waited for the Lights, which are notoriously difficult to forecast, Mr Gottardo, merged almost 4000 pictures of the sky taken from the mountain range. Starry night: the Northern Lights illuminate the sky above Revelstoke, British Columbia. The photograph looks like a CGI construct, but was taken using long exposure techniques . Fluorescent: Northern Lights is a name for aurora, a natural light display. these shots of  the aurora borealis are a reflection of recent solar activity which has caused some amazing light shows . No need for a torch: Richard Gottardo experienced brutal Winter weather during his three-month wait. He said: 'The tent in some shots is that we stayed in and the only heating I had with me was scented candles so everything still smells of vanilla' Forget me not: The sky turns an unforgettable bright blue against the icy peaks of the Rocky mountain range in freezing conditions . He created a timelapse video of the . display but revealed most people will never experience these incredible . sights because there is too much light in cities. The pictures of of circular star . trails are formed by merging multiple photos taken over the course of . several hours. The movement of the Earth means the stars appear in . different places in each image. He said: 'I have experimented with . this type of photography before when I was in Toronto but you can't . really see the stars because too much light is given off in cities. 'I went out into the mountains with . the goal of shooting the stars over the mountains and then I just kept . getting more ideas from there and going back for more. 'In total I spent three months over . the winter in the freezing cold getting the pictures together - camping . out at night with my dog both covered in sleeping bags to stay warm.' All weather endeavour: At the end of his trip, Mr Gottardo hired a snowmobile to make sure he could get the best view possible. he waited to see the Northern Lights for three months, before they could be photographed in April . Optical illusion: Some of the spectacular pictures, which are constructed by layering images on top of each other, look like they have been painted or drawn . Snowy peaks: Mr Guttari spent his expedition in the Rock mountain range. He said he camping out at night with his dog and a sleeping bag to stay warm . Brushstroke effect: The camera's shutter stays open for longer, so more light is absorbed and a brighter image is produced. Mr Gottatrdo's results are stunning . 'The tent in some shots is that we stayed in and the only heating I had with me was scented candles so everything still smells of vanilla. 'But it was definitely worth it to experience such beautiful skies. To make the timelapse video I layered between 3000 and 4000 pictures together. It took some time but it's something I will never forget.' The paths of moving sources stand out . in this form of photography, becoming clearer than the elements around . them. Long exposures are easiest to achieve at night-time or when the . subject is a lot brighter than its background. The camera's shutter stays open for longer, so more light is absorbed and a brighter image is produced. Long-exposure photography is becoming . popular for its ability to turn everyday objects into romantic . portraits and capture sources of light in great detail. But after almost running out of . patience he turned his attention to creating star trails - before his . gruelling trip incredibly ended with the bright night sky being . spectacularly lit up with stars and the aurora clashing overhead. Psychedelic: The moving stars and aurora create an intense portrait of a landscape. The colour scheme makes the sight all the more incredible . Spectacular sky: Some of the images are almost other-worldly in the way they brighten stars . Day and night: One of the rare daytime pictures proves long-exposure photography can be just as effective during the day, when used properly .","29-year-old Richard Gottardo spent a winter camping in the Rocky Mountains to capture Northern Lights .

A victim of the Boston Marathon bombings got an early Christmas present when she was able to stand on her own two feet on Monday for the first time since that dreadful day in April. Rebekah Gregory, 26, has endured a staggering 14 surgeries and faced the prospect of having her left leg amputated countless times over the past eight months. Gregory from Richmond, Texas, was watching her mom race in the marathon when the blast occurred killing three people and wounding 275 others. Rebekah Gregory, 26, from Richmond, Texas, got an early Christmas present when she was able to stand on her own two feet on Monday for the first time since that dreadful day in April . Her left leg was very seriously wounded, she lost a lot of soft tissue and has had to undergo a number of skin grafts. Doctors also had to rebuild her ankle and she was treated for months for a painful bone infection. Due to the complexity of her injuries, Gregory was the last patient connected to the bombings to be released from the hospital.  She was discharged on June 10 - after 56 days in medical centers in Boston and Houston. She had been due to start physical therapy in the summer, but then doctors decided that she needed to have a device drilled into the bone to get her foot into the right position if she hoped to ever walk on it again. That device was taken off just before Thanksgiving and replaced by a cast, which on Monday was replaced by a walking boot. Celebration: Pete DiMartino, 28, and Rebekah Gregory, 26, got engaged in October - six months after they both suffered serious injuries in the Boston Marathon bombings . ‘To put two feet on the ground again was the most amazing feeling,’ she told NBC News. ‘And just right before Christmas, too. It’s like, what an amazing present this year.’ But Gregory still has a long way to go, and she has described the moment she put her foot down in the boot as extremely painful. ‘It was awful. It was the worst pain all over again,’ she said. ‘Putting it on the ground doesn’t feel right and it feels like it’s just crushing what bones I have left.’ Gregory admits that she was initially disappointed on Monday that she couldn’t walk out of the doctor’s office in the boot. Her doctors estimate that it will be another six months to a year before she is walking more freely. For now, Gregory is just happy at how far she has come since the blast. Runners continue to run towards the finish line of the Boston Marathon as an explosion erupts near the finish line of the race that killed three people and wounded 275 others . ‘It just hit me: I’ve come such a long way and even though I have such a long way to go, I’m so blessed for this journey and to be able to help people and inspire people along the way,’ she said. Also watching Rebekah’s mom Tina run in the Boston marathon was her boyfriend-now-fiancé Pete DiMartino, 28, and her six-year-old son Noah. He proposed to her in October by kneeling beside her wheelchair at her home in Richmond, Texas, and presenting her with a ring he had custom-made following the April 15 attack. She said yes. 'I said, ""You're my best friend and I . love you"",' he told NBC News. 'I couldn't get anything else out, I was shaking.' The couple, who met on a work trip, have been together for a year and said they knew before the attacks that they had found the perfect match - but agreed the experience brought them even closer.

As well as a ruptured eardrum, DiMartino lost 90 per cent of his right Achilles' tendon and suffered broken bones in his ankles and it has taken him months of physical therapy to learn to walk again. DiMartino said watching his . girlfriend fight through the multiple surgeries was inspiring and he . joked that he 'had to jump on it before somebody else did'. 'Going through an experience like the . marathon makes you realize how short life really is and how we don't . really know how much time we have left,' Gregory said. Together: The couple, who have been together a year, were standing near the finish line when the bombs exploded on April 15. Rebekah has undergone 14 surgeries since and on Monday stood on her two feet for the first time since the blast . 'And I know that with my time . there is nobody else I would want to spend it with. It made me . realize how much I cared about him and how much he was the only person . for me.' The couple are now building a home in Richmond, and DiMartino will move there from his home in Rochester, New York. They have designed the house, which includes a master bedroom on the ground floor to make it easier for Gregory. DiMartino is even working towards taking part in an upcoming 5K race.

'We're marrying each other, that's all that matters,' Gregory said. Strong: The couple are pictured with Gregory's son before the blasts on the day of the bombings.
