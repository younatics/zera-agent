"A Medicare call centre worker jailed for possessing a haul of 22,000 child porn images kept his job while he was behind bars - by using his annual leave and leave without pay while in prison. Samuel James Lawless, 31, from Brisbane, is still employed by the Human Services Department despite admitting possessing and transmitting the child pornography between September 2006 and June 2013, The Courier Mail reports. Samuel James Lawless has been convicted of collecting child porn and is currently serving time in prison . The Department of Human Services has told Daily Mail Australia that it 'cannot discuss matters relating to individual staff'. But a spokesman added: 'Generally speaking, the department will consider appropriate disciplinary action as soon as it becomes aware that an employee has been convicted of a criminal offence. 'Where any matter is identified as possibly breaching the APS Code of Conduct, it is referred to the department’s Conduct Standards Team for consideration. Lawless has kept his Medicare job by using annual leave and leave without pay . 'Serious breaches generally result in termination of employment.' Lawless is due to be released from Wolston Correctional Centre within a matter of weeks and authorities are investigating whether his employment should end, reports Channel 9. Marise Payne, Human Services Minister, told Channel 9 all government employees were expected to abide by the Australian Public Service code of conduct. He pleaded guilty to possessing and transmitting the child pornography between September 2006 and June 2013 and is in prison weeks away from finishing his jail sentence . A department spokeswoman said paid leave is not normally agreed when the department is aware that the employee is serving a jail sentence. A spokesman for Queensland Police told Daily Mail Australia they could not comment on the case.","Samuel James Lawless has been convicted of collecting child porn .

"A colony of ants could help scientists develop a new strain of antibiotics to help fight the growing global menace of resistant superbugs. Prime Minister David Cameron has today warned that the world could be plunged back into the 'dark ages of medicine' because of lack of new antibiotics. Bacteria is becoming increasingly resistant to existing medicines and new stronger antibiotics need to be found before some diseases become uncurable. British scientists at the University of East Anglia say the leafcutter ants could save countless lives thanks to a natural antibiotic they produce. Three colonies of leafcutter ants could provide a breakthrough in developing new antibiotics to help in the fight against resistant superbugs. The ants have already helped scientists at the University of East Anglia discover two potential new drugs . Researcher Dr Matthew Hutchings said: 'Antibiotic resistance is a global health threat. Even common infections which have been treatable for decades can once again kill. 'Our research is motivated by an urgent need to find new antibiotics. 'We hope that these leafcutter ants will help us solve antibiotic resistance and provide us with the next generation of drugs. 'These ants have already helped us find two new antibiotics which we hope will be useful in clinical medicine.' The pioneering research by the School of Biological Studies centres on a particular type of fungus the ants eat, and how the ants’ natural resistance protects it. Dr Hutchings said: 'Leafcutter ants from South and Central America evolved antibiotic use 50million years ago. An increasing number of superbugs, including MRSA - a computer generated image of the bacteria, pictured - are becoming resistant to the antibiotics currently used by doctors across the world . 'They love to eat a particular kind of . fungus, which the worker ants protect using natural antibiotics produced . by bacteria on their bodies. 'The worker ants climb over the . fungus and sniff it, and any fungus, which we call weeds, that aren’t . the food they eat they take over to a completely different area and . sterilise. 'They rub more . than one antibiotic - they produce several - onto the weeds using their . chest plates which excrete it, and then bury it. This means the fungus they eat can thrive.' Prime Minister David Cameron today warned we could be plunged back into the dark ages of medicine if new antibiotics are not found . He added: 'We questioned why there were no problems in ants compared to human antibiotics and found they use multiple drug combinations to prevent drug resistance from arising. 'So by using multiple antibiotics at once, we can slow the rise of antibiotic-resistant superbugs. 'This is something that human medicine is only just starting to explore.' There are eight scientists at the university who have been working on the project for seven years with three large colonies of ants. They hope the ants will not only provide the next generation of antibiotics but also show beneficial ways of working with bacteria. The team’s research will be on display at the Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition 2014 from July 1 to July 6, which showcases the best in British innovation. A captive leafcutter ant colony will be displayed alongside an ‘antibiotic discovery zone’ at the Summer Science Exhibition. Two thirds of antibiotics are 'natural products' made by a group of bacteria called actinomycetes that live in the soil. But when soil bacteria produce these antibiotics they also express resistance genes to protect them against the antibiotic’s toxic effects. These resistance genes have spread to other 'bad' bacteria, causing some strains to evolve and render many antibiotics useless.","Scientists at the University of East Anglia believe three colonies of leafeater ants could be the key to developing new strains of antibiotics .

"The mother who died, along with her three children after a fatal car crash,  may have been speeding at 160km/h while driving under the influence of drugs, an investigation has found. Keisha Ann Jackson, from Wurtulla on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, had been driving along Glenview Road with her four children on August 22 when her car slid off the wet road and slammed into a tree. The results of the toxicology  show the 30-year-old had cannabis in her system, which police believe would have affected her ability to drive, according to the Courier Mail. The preliminary results estimated the mother had driven between 130km/h and 160km/h  in a 80km/h zone at night. Scroll down for video . Krystal Percival may have been speeding at 160km/h while driving under the influence of drugs, an investigation has found . Four children, Matilda, Ethan, Ryan and Joan, were in the car when it crashed in Queensland on August 22. Ethan, 11, is the only child who has survived the accident . Acting Sergeant Duncan Hale, from the Sunshine Coast Forensic Crash Unit, told Courier Mail that Ms Jackson’s blood samples found cannabis in her system. 'Analysis results have shown that at the time of the crash she had cannabis in her blood at a level that would have had an affect on her ability to safely control a vehicle,' he said. Sergeant Hale said an investigation of the road's sweeping curve and the wet conditions revealed the car was travelling at least 130km/h. 'It appears to have been a loss of control due to excessive speed,' he told the Courier Mail. Ms Jackson died at the scene alongside her son Ryan Jackson-Cooke, 10, and her daughter Joan Jackson, seven, according to Queensland Police. Matilda Jackson-Cooke, four, died overnight after being in a critical condition at Royal Brisbane Hospital since the accident. Ryan and four-year-old Matilda were found in the grass nearby and appeared to have been thrown from the vehicle upon impact. Two of Ms Jackson's children died at the scene. Her oldest son Ethan, 11, managed to escape with only minor injuries while her youngest child, Matilda, 4, died in hospital . In the wake of the tragic incident, Ms Jackson's best friend, Krystal Percival, told the Sunday Mail that Ms Jackson had expressed grave concern about driving along the very road she died on. 'She told me ""One of these days I’m going to die on this corner"",' Ms Percival, 27, said. Since news of the accident spread, family and friends have expressed their shock over the incident. 'I wished this has never happened to you I hope I will see you in the next life in the spirit world and your kids as well. You will always be in my heart for ever,' Amanda Lando wrote on Facebook. Ms Jackson's eldest child, 11-year-old Ethan Jackson miraculously managed to survive the crash. He only sustained minor injuries according to police, and was discharged from hospital. The 11-year-old managed to escape the wreck after the accident and flag down a car that was passing by, Verena Hart, an aged care nurse who had been passing by at the time, told the Northern Star. 'He was covered in blood and grass and mud, he was all dazed and confused,' she said. Ms Hart, Ethan and a policeman that he’d managed to flag down, then went to find the wreckage together in the dark. Krystal Percival (left), the best friend of mother-of-four Keisha Ann Jackson (right) who died after her slammed into a tree on, said that her friend had predicted her own death . They discovered seven-year-old Joan, caught in her seat belt and barely breathing at the scene that Ms Hart described as appearing 'like a bomb had gone off'. She was unable to be saved by paramedics and died at the scene. Forensic investigators are still looking into the incident, and are considering the issues of speed and seatbelts. Acting Superintendent John Boznjak said told Sunshine Coast Daily: 'It appears that speed might be a factor. There are several factors we are looking at, particularly speed, they are awaiting toxicology reports which will take some time to establish if there is anything in that regard to look at.'","Toxicology results show Keisha Ann Jackson had cannabis in her system .

"Rev Chris Briggs said the wearing of witch and Devil costumes over Halloween represents a 'far greater evil' than Nazis and terrorists . A church minister has said that the wearing of witch and Devil costumes over Halloween represents a 'far greater evil' than Nazis and terrorists. Reverend Chris Briggs, from the Portland Methodist Circuit in Dorset, said parents would not allow their children to go door to door collecting sweets wearing Adolf Hitler or Islamic State fighter costumes but would allow them to dress as the Devil and witches. On his blog Ministerial Meanderings, he wrote: 'I want you to imagine a scenario: you hear a knock at the door and open it. 'Outside, you see two small children with a beaming parent - after all, letting children go door to door in the dark is ridiculous. 'One young child is dressed as Adolf Hitler and has swastikas on their arm. 'The other is dressed as an Islamic State fighter carrying an IS flag. 'I rather suspect that many people would think not only is this bad taste but celebrating such evil is highly inappropriate to say the least. I would agree. 'Yet we encourage children to dress as witches and the Devil and the like, deliberately encouraging dressing up as something that represents far greater evil. 'I think we have our values and standards back to front in this country.' Mr Briggs added that Christians should shun Halloween as 'society would be better off if it avoided it'.

'Billed as a fun time by businesses that see a market opportunity to be exploited, youngsters and adults are encouraged to dress up in inappropriate costumes designed to scare people. 'One large store for instance is selling chainsaws with what purports to be dripping blood. 'How amusing to open your door to see a six-year-old carrying that.

No Christian has any business encouraging anything to do with Halloween and society would be better off if it avoided it.' Instead of celebrating Halloween tonight, the reverend is throwing a 'Light Party', including a disco rather than traditional games, according to the Daily Express. Halloween is thought to have originated from the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, a day to mark the end of harvest and the beginning of winter - a transition that was believed to be a bridge to the world of the dead. In the eighth century, Pope Gregory III designated November 1 as a time to honour saints and martyrs and October 31 was known as All Hallows' Eve, which later became Halloween.

"Ed Miliband has asked a group of his senior MPs to form an attack unit against Ukip, by branding them the heirs to Margaret Thatcher . Ed Miliband has asked a group of his senior MPs to form an attack unit against Ukip, by branding them the heirs to Margaret Thatcher. Amid growing fears about the party’s appeal to traditional Labour voters, he has asked Northern-based members of his team including shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper and energy spokeswoman Caroline Flint to head the operation. It is a sign of the growing panic within his party about Ukip – after Labour only narrowly clung on to one its heartland seats of Heywood and Middleton in a by-election last week, by 617 votes. The taskforce which also includes former minister John Healey and Jon Trickett, a close ally of Mr Miliband, was formed several months ago but will be stepping up its attacks in the coming weeks. Their slogan describes Ukip as ‘More Tory than the Tories’, and has already accused Mr Farage’s party of advocating a flat tax for everyone regardless of income and charging patients to use the NHS. Labour will apply this attack to other policies and also target Mr Farage personally as an ‘ex-Tory ex-banker’ and ardent admirer of Lady Thatcher - last year he claimed his party were ‘the true inheritors of Thatcher’ in the hope of putting off voters in deprived Northern seats. A source said this was working well on the doorsteps in former industrial areas being targeted by Ukip, but had not had enough time to make an impact before the by-election in Lancashire. Nigel Farage held his party’s conference in Doncaster, Mr Miliband’s constituency, last month and declared: ‘We are now parking our tanks on the Labour Party’s lawn.’ He declared last week that Ukip was ‘tearing vast chunks’ out of the Labour vote in traditional strongholds such as the north of England and Wales. In recent weeks, Ukip representatives have moved to the Left on several issues and been at pains to claim they would choose to keep the health service free at the point of use. Nigel Farage held his party’s conference in Doncaster, Mr Miliband’s constituency, last month and declared: ‘We are now parking our tanks on the Labour Party’s lawn.’ They also now oppose the so-called ‘Bedroom Tax’ on spare rooms in council homes and a trade agreement which would affect the NHS. The by-election scare prompted a change of tone about immigration within the Labour party. Mr Miliband and Miss Cooper both claiming publicly after the result that they understood people’s concerns about it and would take action to stop local people losing out on jobs and housing. But many within the party fear it could be too little too late, with Nigel Farage determined to pick up ‘left behind’ former Labour supporters at the next general election in seven months’ time. Labour had previously been content with polls showing that Ukip took far more votes from former Conservatives than former Labour voters.","The Labour leader has branded UKIP 'the true inheritors of Thatcher'

"A 61-year-old St. Louis County man has been sentenced to 30 years in prison after pleading guilty to beating his wife to death with a laptop and then trying to make it look like an accident. William Lynn Gunter, of Town and Country, pleaded guilty Monday to second-degree murder in the March 2013 death of 55-year-old Suzanne Ball Gunter. The couple had been married three decades and had two grown daughters. Gunter, a vice president of a private insurance company, initially lied to police that he found his wife unconscious from a fall down the stairway in their $440,000 home. Justice for Suzy: William Lynn Gunter, left, was sentenced to 30 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to killing his wife, Suzanne Ball Gunter, right, by hitting her in the head with a laptop . County prosecutors said Gunter was cheating on his wife and having financial problems when he repeatedly struck Suzanne on the head. Assistant prosecutor Ed Magee told St Louis Post-Dispatch that Suzanne Gunter had more than $1million in savings and life insurance benefits, but she was in control of all the assets and not her husband. A police officer who responded to the Gunters' home at 1515 Mason Hill Court at around 3pm on March 18, 2013, found the husband sitting on the floor near the front door and sobbing uncontrollably while cradling his unconscious wife's bashed head in his lap. Both spouses were covered in blood. Mrs Gunter was rushed to a local hospital, where she was pronounced dead from severe head trauma. An autopsy later showed that she suffered nine gashes on her head and a broken wrist. When interviewed by police, Mr Gunter said that he had been in the living room when he heard his wife upstairs yelling at their dog, followed by the sound of a loud thump. But Mrs Gunter’s injuries were inconsistent with his story, and her husband was initially charged with first-degree murder. Prosperous: The murder happened in March 2013 inside the family's four-bedroom, $440,000 home in the well-off St Louis suburb of Town and Country . According to investigators, the 61-year-old man struck his wife in the head with a laptop and then called neighbors over to his house for help, telling them that Mrs Gunter had an accident. Local residents said William Gunter appeared devastated. He seemed too upset to ride in the ambulance with his wife, so one of the neighbors gave him a ride to Mercy Hospital, where the victim was pronounced dead a short time later. The couple's two grown daughters were not home at the time of the tragic incident, police said. According to his LinkedIn page, William Gunter was a vice president of AHM Financial Group, a St Louis firm specializing in insurance, investment and asset management. Gunter’s attorney said Monday the 61-year-old father of two will be eligible for parole in about 11 years. The lawyer explained that his client has opted to take the plea deal to spare their daughters from testifying at a trial. His slain wife graduated in 1980 from Indiana University with a degree in communications and marketing. On her Facebook page, the youthful-looking mother of two listed her previous occupation as a client delivery manager for Xerox. Tragic loss: Mrs Gunter, pictured here with her two grown daughters, graduated from Indiana University in 1980 and worked for the City of Town and Country's community relations commission . Mrs Gunter volunteered with the Parkways School District and the City of Town and Country, working for the community relations commission. The victim’s family told the paper they were satisfied with the outcome of the case. ‘We are relieved it’s been solved and he’s going to prison to pay for all that he’s done,’ said Suzanne’s older sister, Kathy Ball Laesch. Town and Country is a wealthy suburb of St Louis with the highest median household income of any city in Missouri with population over 10,000, and one of the highest nationwide.","William Lynn Gunter, 61, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in March 2013 death of his wife of 30 years, 55-year-old Suzanne Ball Gunter .

"Melbourne Cup race goers will no doubt be reaching for the Berocca and nursing sore heads this morning as the hangover sets in after a long day of celebrations across the nation. At this year’s race that stops a nation, more than 100,000 punters flocked through the gates at Flemington racecourse in Melbourne, for a day of horse racing fun, which for some, was just an excuse to take a day off work, dress the part and enjoy with friends.

While thousands more around the country enjoyed countless lunches, parties and glamorous functions to get in the spirit of Australia's biggest horse race.

"Lava threatening a rural Hawaii town has stopped its slow, menacing advance — for now. Hawaii County Civil Defense officials said Thursday the front of the lava flow has been stalled for about a week. However it's still about 480 feet from Pahoa Village Road, which goes through downtown. It's possible the lava could start to be more active in the coming days. Officials are continuing to monitor other parts of the flow where the lava has branched out. HALT: Lava threatening the rural Hawaiian town of Pahoa Village has stopped its slow, forward advance for now, Hawaii County Civil Defense officials said Thursday . Dormant: While the lava has not moved since last Thursday, it could start up in the coming days, officials said . Aerial: Lava from the Kilauea Volcano flows across the ground on November 3, 2014 in Pahoa, Hawaii . Destructive: Molten rock from the flow is inching its way towards homes in the town of Pahoa on Hawaii's Big Island where close to a thousand people live . Long trail: The Kølauea volcano has been active since a fissure eruption on in January 1983. It attracts tourists who travel to Hawaii to watch red hot glowing lava flow into the Pacific Ocean . Residents in the Big Island's Puna district have had weeks to prepare for the slow-moving lava from Kilauea volcano. On October 26, the flow crossed a country street on the edge of Pahoa. Since then, it's smothered part of a cemetery and burned down a garden shed. The lava also has also burned tires, some metal materials and vegetation. On Monday President Obama declared the lava flow to be a natural disaster, Reuters reported. The declaration frees up federal money to help protect local communities in Pahoa and the district of Puna from the lava flow, which began moving toward homes on June 27. Pahoa residents have had weeks to prepare for what's been described as a slow-motion disaster. Most have either already left or are prepared to go. At least 50 or 60 structures — including homes and businesses — are in an area civil defense officials are currently warning will likely be hit. Josiah Hunt, who has farm in a part of Puna that is not immediately threatened, described smelling burning grass, feeling warmth from the lava and hearing 'popping and sizzling and all the methane bursts that are happening in the distance ... mixed with the birds chirping and the coqui frogs.' The Lagrimas family decided to move to Kurtistown, a safe distance from Kilauea's current flow. 'We didn't want to go anywhere where it's close enough where we would have to evacuate again,' she said.

Gaping: This photo, taken on October 31, shows a hole left behind by a large tree that was surrounded by lava, burned through at its base and collapsed onto the solidified flow surface . Cooled by the rain: Small breakouts from an inflating Pahoehoe lava lobe in a privately owned orchard near the town of Pahoa . The lava flow from the Kilauea Volcano burns vegetation as seen in this U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) photo  November 4, 2014 . The Lagrimases are also worried the lava will block roads leading out of Pahoa and prevent them from commuting to their jobs in Hilo. Then there's the prospect of subsequent flows gradually swallowing more of the community, which is what happened to the Royal Garden and Kalapana subdivisions in the 1980s and 1990s. 'It's so surreal, it's so surreal. Never in my wildest dreams as a kid growing up did I think I would be running from lava,' said Denise Lagrimas. Some people want to watch the lava destroy their homes as it's one way to cope with the loss. 'You can only imagine the frustration as well as ... despair they're going through,' said Hawaii County Civil Defense Director Darryl Oliveira. Hunt watched last week as the lava crept toward Pahoa and saw a woman whose house is near its path put a lei at the front of the flow. 'It helps a person come to grips with the reality of the situation,' he said. 'I found it to be oddly comforting in a really strange way.' Terri Mulroy, who runs Kumu Aina Farm with her husband, said the lava flow, while unnerving, has a cleansing quality to it because it keeps development on the lush Hawaiian island in check. 'If it wasn't for the flow, I wouldn't be able to live here,' she said. 'This land would have been a golf course for the rich.' SLOW CREEP . Scientists began warning the public about the lava on Aug. 22. At the time, residents were cleaning up from a tropical storm that made landfall over the Puna district, toppling trees and knocking out electricity. The lava has advanced and slowed as residents waited and watched. Kilauea volcano, one of the world's most active, has been erupting continuously since 1983. This is not an eruption at the caldera, the things that make for stunning pictures as red lava spews from the mountaintop. Decomposition of vegetation in the lava's path has created methane gas, which if it accumulates and is ignited by heat can cause a blast, Babb said. 'It's not a massive explosion,' she said. 'But it can dislodge rocks. It can hurl large rocks several feet.' WHO IS AT RISK? Initially, the lava seemed headed for the Kaohe Homesteads, a widespread, sparsely populated subdivision in the Puna district. It reached vacant lots in the subdivision before it stalled. It skirted the northeast corner of the subdivision and then headed toward Pahoa. Pahoa has small-town, quaint and historic charm, but it's 'the only town in a commercial sense in lower Puna,' said state Sen. Russell Ruderman, who represents Puna and runs a natural food store in Pahoa. Because the lava could change direction, any community in Puna is at risk. Everyone in the district lives on the volcano. The lush, agricultural district is about a 30-minute drive from the coastal town of Hilo. The lava that crossed Apaa Street is on the other end of the street from the Raras home, but they're bracing for the possibility the lava will spread or change directions. COUNTRY-STYLE LIVING . Why would someone live on an active volcano? Unlike Honolulu, the state's biggest city on the island of Oahu, the Big Island's Puna region has affordable land and offers a more rural way of life. Located on the island's southeast side, the area is made up of subdivisions that have unpaved roads of volcanic rock. Many live off the grid on solar power and catchment water systems. Residents know the risks as there are special insurance requirements to buy land in certain lava zones. PREPARATIONS . Sporadic suspensions in the lava's movement gave emergency crews time to work on building alternate routes to town in the event the flow covers the main road and highway. Crews near the leading edge have been wrapping power poles with concrete rings as a layer of protection from lava heat. Officials worried that if lava crosses Highway 130, it would isolate Puna from the rest of the island. 'Puna will be divided into the north side of the flow and the south side of the flow,' Ruderman said. Raras said they began putting their belongings in storage in September. What they aren't able to take with them, they're photographing for insurance purposes. HOW LONG WILL THE RISK REMAIN? No one knows if the lava flow will stop, change direction or hit homes. In the 1990s, about 200 homes were destroyed by lava flows from Kilauea. The last evacuations from the volcano came in 2011. One home was destroyed and others were threatened before the lava changed course. CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE . Kilauea is home to Pele, the Hawaiian volcano goddess. Some residents expressed anger at suggestions to divert the flow. They say it's culturally insensitive to interfere with Pele's will. YOUNG VOLCANO . The U.S. Geological Survey says Kilauea is the youngest volcano on Hawaii Island. Officials estimate Kilauea's first eruption happened between 300,000 and 600,000 years ago. DON'T CANCEL VACATION PLANS . The lava isn't a reason to cancel a Big Island vacation because it's an isolated event. Officials have warned people to stay away from the area and imposed flight restrictions because of helicopter tours hoping to see lava.","Pahoa Village on the Big Island of Hawaii has known for months that Kilauea's molten lava is on its way to reclaim their town of 800 .
The unpredictable advancement of the liquid rock, which stopped completely for a time in September, was travelling at speeds of about 10 to 15 yards per hour .
It has been stalled for about a week .
Villagers in the lava's path began to pack up their valuables last week, not wanting to wait for disaster to strike .
The 1,650 degrees Fahrenheit lava was about 480 yards from the main road in Pahoa on Thursday .

"Voters who back UKIP at the next election risk 'going to bed with Nigel Farage and waking up with Ed Miliband', David Cameron has warned. The Prime Minister said the next election would be a 'straight fight' between Labour and the Tories, and a vote for UKIP made it more likely that Ed Miliband becomes Prime Minister in 2015. The jibe came just hours before former Tory donor Arron Banks announced he was handing £1million to UKIP, in protest at being dismissed as a 'nobody' by senior Conservative William Hague. Scroll down for video . David Cameron warned that a vote for UKIP would make it easier for Labour to win the next election . He said voters who back UKIP at the next election risk 'going to bed with Nigel Farage and waking up with Ed Miliband' The PM warned voters toying with the idea of voting UKIP that they were really voting for Labour. But hours after Mr Cameron's attack in his conference speech, millionaire Tory party donor Mr Banks announced he was donating £1million to UKIP. The move came after the Tories were left stunned by the double defection of rebel backbenchers Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless. The pair were also joined by Boris Johnson's former deputy London mayor Richard Barnes. But Mr Cameron insisted that a vote for UKIP would only make a Labour government more likely. He told the Conservative conference: ''Let's be clear. This is a straight fight. It doesn't matter whether Parliament is hung, drawn or quartered, there is only one real choice. 'The Conservatives or Labour. Me in Downing Street, or Ed Miliband in Downing Street. 'If you vote UKIP – that's really a vote for Labour.' He went on: 'Here's a thought: on 7th May you could go to bed with Nigel Farage, and wake up with Ed Miliband. I don't know about you but not one bit of that works for me. 'So this is the big question for that election. On the things that matter in your life, who do you really trust? 'When it comes to your job, do you trust Labour – who wrecked our economy – or the Conservatives, who have made this one of the fastest-growing economies in the West? 'When it comes to Britain's future, who do you trust? Labour – the party of something-for-nothing, and human wrongs under the banner of human rights, or the Conservatives – who believe in something for something, and reward for hard work?' UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the Tories were paying for insulting UKIP supporters like multi-millionaire Arron Banks (right) who upped his donation to UKIP to £1million . Mr Cameron's remarks came Mr Banks, who has previously given tens of thousands of pounds to the Conservatives, announced today that he was switching his allegiance to UKIP. He initially said he was going to give the party £100,000. But last night he announced he was handing the party £1million to fight the next election - because he was angry at being called a 'nobody' by William Hague. Mr Hague - the Commons leader - dismissed the importance of Mr Banks' defection yesterday morning. He said: 'I've never heard of him so we are not going to get too upset about that. It's certainly not going to overshadow the prime minister's speech today that someone we haven't heard of has gone to Ukip.' The remarks infuriated Mr Banks, causing him to increase his planned donation to UKIP. The joke was captured in this photograph of the autocue, after Mr Cameron rejected the idea of following Mr Miliband to deliver his speech from memory . Speaking to reporters last night he said: 'In light of that and in view of the fact that I am a strong advocate of leaving the EU, I've decided to donate £1million to the party and not the £100,000 originally agreed.' He added: 'Mr Hague will now know who I am.' Mr Farage said the donation had capped a 'remarkable week' for UKIP following Mr Reckless's defection on Saturday. He also lashed out at the personal attacks directed against UKIP during the Tory party conference in Birmingham. The UKIP threat has sparked an angry torrent of abuse against Mr Farage's party at the Tory conference in Birmingham this week. Boris Johnson accused defectors of being the kind of people who had sex with vacuum cleaners - while former Chancellor Ken Clarke said the party's supporters were 'grumpy old men' who had led 'disappointing lives'. Mr Cameron, meanwhile, attacked Mr Reckless for betraying the hard work of ordinary Conservative activists which had got his 'fat arse' into the Commons.","Prime Minister warns there is a 'straight choice' between him or Miliband .

Belajonas then took a peek inside and came upon the racy letter from an unnamed inmate. According to Daily News, Belajonas took to Facebook after slaying his wife and wrote: 'Had an argument. She was cheating on me. I won.' Belajonas dragged his two sons - aged four and five - from the house, with a neighbor telling investigators they heard one of the children say: 'Is mommy dead?' Fearing for the safety of the two boys, an Amber Alert was issued for Belajonas' gray Nissan Pathfinder about 4.30am, Pennsylvania license plate number JDH7477, setting off a three-state manhunt.

"The family of the 53-year-old Colorado man found safe five days after he went missing during a Denver Broncos game have revealed that he 'had some sort of breakdown' and is currently recovering from his ordeal. The Denver Police Department tweeted just before 11pm on Tuesday that 53-year-old Paul Kitterman had been found alive more than 110 miles south of Denver in the city of Pueblo, and that no foul play is suspected. 'Right now we are still unsure what happened to Paul. We know he is very tired. Scroll down for videos . Vanishing act: Paul Kitterman (second left) told police he disposed of his Denver Broncos hat after leaving the stadium last Thursday during halftime so he would not be recognized on his way 'somewhere warm.' Also pictured are his stepson Jarod (far right), friend Tia Bakke (second right) and her boyfriend Jay Yust (left) 'We are not certain of what has happened but we know Paul had some sort of breakdown,' said stepson Jarod Tonneson and friend Tia Bakke in a statement to ABC News. Reached by phone, Kitterman's father, Allen, told MailOnline that his son was 'catching up on his sleep.' 'He's back home with his friends. We have not spoken to him but we are glad he's OK,' he said. 'We are trying to let him sleep, he's catching up on his sleep. I appreciate your concern.' Earlier on Wednesday Kitterman's family had released a statement saying the 53-year-old man was 'in a fragile state, both physically and mentally.' 'At this time, even family and friends do not have the while story. They are respecting Paul's wishes for personal space and time to process the events of the past five days.' Colorado police have revealed that Kitterman disposed of his hat emblazoned with the Broncos' logo before embarking on a 112-mile journey to Pueblo last Thursday. The above map shows the distance between Broncos Stadium, where Kitterman went missing on Thursday, and Pueblo, Colorado where he was found unharmed five days later . Pueblo police said they found Kitterman coherent outside a Kmart store after a citizen spotted him, Fox Denver reports. He reportedly told police that he wanted to escape to some place warm. Police there said he appeared to be in good health, and has been put up in a hotel to await the arrival of his grown stepson, whom he had left alone during halftime at Mile High Stadium five days earlier. According to police, they got a call from a family friend Tuesday saying they had picked up Kitterman at a Salvation Army and took him to a Rodeway Inn in Pueblo, but by the time officers arrived at the motel the man was gone. Soon after, police received a call from the owner of Benfatti Furniture who spotted Kitterman and recognized him as the missing man from news reports. The 53-year-old was picked up next to a Kmart store near the Pueblo Mall. Kitterman, who had no car and no cellphone on him, revealed that he walked and hitchhiked from Denver to Pueblo located 112 miles away because 'he'd had his fill of football,' reported USA Today. The father also allegedly told police that he enjoyed taking walks, reported the station KOAA. With only about $50 in his pocket, the construction warm said he slept in trees and bushes along the way. Kitterman 'even mentioned disposing of his Broncos hat as he did not want to be recognized,' police told NBC News. According to police in Pueblo, the divorced dad was surprised to learn that his disappearance has made national headlines. Kitterman, who had been described by his family as someone who is not comfortable with technology, told officers that he had not seen any television since he took off from the stadium. Earlier in the day Tuesday, Kitterman's family had a scare when police found the body of a middle-aged man near train tracks in the vicinity of the football stadium, but it was quickly determined that it was not the missing dad. Paul Kitterman's family have released a statement on Facebook thanking everyone for offering them support and asking the public and the media to respect their privacy. 'The family is happy to report Paul has been found and they are now with him and he is safe,' read the status update posted Tuesday night. Safe and well - but where was he? Denver Police said that no foul play was suspected in Kitterman's disappearance. They referred all further questions to the man's family . Denver Police Sgt. Steve Warneke said that no criminal charges are expected. 'All we were trying to do was make sure he was unharmed, and he was,' Warneke said. 'So at that point, we're finished."" Police referred all other questions to Kitterman's family. Kitterman was last seen on Thursday when his stepson left him at halftime to use the restroom. On Monday night, Denver police revealed that a witness saw Kitterman inside the stadium during the third quarter, but it remains unknown where the man went after the game. Jarod Tonneson, Kitterman’s stepson, as well as his friends, have publicly criticized  investigators for allegedly not doing enough to locate the missing man. 'I think they should take us more seriously,' Tonneson said during an interview on Fox News Tuesday morning. Tia Bakke, Kitterman's friend who took him to the fateful game on Thursday, told MailOnline Monday: 'He's now been missing for four days and we have had absolutely no leads whatsoever. But police don't consider it a priority. Father and son: Jarod Tonneson (left) and Paul went with Tia Bakke and her boyfriend for their first Broncos game on Thursday . 'They say he is an adult and there is no sign of foul play so there is nothing much they can do,' she added. 'I am trying to maintain a positive, hopeful attitude, but I am very, very worried.' Kitterman, who is unmarried and lives alone in Kremmling, was at his first ever professional football game when he vanished. Bakke and her boyfriend Jay Yust - for whom Kitterman has worked for the last 10 years - had invited him last-minute to go to Thursday's crunch AFC West face-off against the San Diego Chargers along with his 21-year-old stepson, Jarod Tonneson. In their haste, Kitterman forgot his cellphone, took no credit cards and very little cash. Still, Kitterman had memorized his friends' phone numbers and would have found ways to reach out if he wanted to leave. Mystery: Kitterman - pictured with Jarod at the game - did not have his cell phone or his credit cards with him when he vanished, Bakke said . 'We are regulars, we are not season ticket holders, but this was the fourth Broncos game we have been to this season, and we have taken other friends with us before,' said Bakke. 'But Paul had never been to a game.' The friends couldn't get seats together so Bakke and Yust sat in one section of the Sports Authority Field at Mile High while Kitterman and his son went to another, section number 230. The foursome met up at halftime when the Broncos were leading 14-7 — but that is the last time that Kitterman, who works on Yust's MY Ranch in Kremmling, Colorado, was seen. 'He was super-excited about the game. It was the first time he had been and the Broncos were ahead and playing well,' Bakke, 24, told MailOnline. 'Jarod needed to use the restroom and we left Paul waiting outside for him - it couldn't have been more than 10 feet from where we had been standing.' But when Jarod came out, his father was nowhere to be found so he went back to his seat in the south bleachers to watch the second half of the game, assuming he would soon rejoin him. Back home: Bakke told MailOnline that Kitterman said that it was uncharacteristic of him to disappear. She said he's 'extremely reliable. Paul is the most trustworthy person you could ever wish to meet' When the game ended in a 35-21 Bronco victory around 9.30 pm, Bakke called Tonneson telling him she and her 30-year-old boyfriend were waiting at Gate 8 ready for the two-hour drive back to Kremmling. 'He said he was waiting for Paul and asked me if he was with us, I said ""no, I thought he was with you.""' For nearly three frantic hours the trio searched the 13-year-old, 76,000-capacity stadium with no luck. They called the police, local hospitals, even jails and detox facilities in the hope that someone could give them a lead. Tonneson told Denver's Fox affiliate, KDVR-TV he and his friends had looked in 'parking lots, trees, bushes, anywhere we could think of'. Farm hand: Kitterman worked at a ranch owned by the friends he went to the game with. Bakke said: 'He would hate the fuss that is growing up around his disappearance' Eventually they left for the long journey home, hoping against hope that Paul would be waiting for them when they returned to Kremmling. Bakke called the frustrating days following the game 'the longest, most miserable days of her life'. According to his son, Paul had four or five beers in the course of a four-hour span, not enough to become disoriented. Tia Bakke told MailOnline that Kitterman has worked for her boyfriend for nearly a decade and has always been extremely reliable. 'Paul is the most trustworthy person you could ever wish to meet,' she said. 'He would hate the fuss that is growing up around his disappearance. Paul is just not the type of person who would do something like this for attention. 'He would never deliberately let anyone worry about him, that is just not who he is,' she added. 'He never wants stress or heartache or anything like that. He is the type of person that if you are having a bad day will do anything he can to be there for you.","Denver Police say Paul Kitterman, 53, is safe after being located more than 110 miles away in Pueblo, Colorado .

"Children as young as 11 and 12 are being caught drink driving, as alarming police records reveal how thousands of underage drivers have been drunk behind the wheel. An 11-year-old offender was apprehended in the Thames Valley area in 2011 while ‘numerous’ 12-year-olds were stopped in Scotland in 2012 and in Manchester in 2008, say police chiefs. More widely, an average of 1,000 people per year aged under the age of 18 have been convicted of drink-driving since 2008, according to the police figures obtained by in-car camera provider Nextbase under Freedom of Information laws. Under the influence: Children as young as 11 have been caught drink driving (picture posed by model) More than a quarter (26 per cent) of drink drivers under 18 were 16 or younger, meaning they were not of the legal age to drive. The statistics showed there were an average of five drink drivers under 18 caught each week since 2008. The worrying statistics are based on responses from 43 police forces following Freedom of Information Act requests. The figures covered the number of under-18 drink-drivers caught in the six years from 2008 to 2013. They reveal that every one of the 43 forces had apprehended under-18 drink-drivers during the six years covered. The figures showed that the worst English region for underage drink-driving in this period was Greater Manchester, where 409 under-18s were arrested. Other hotspots included Scotland, with 718 drink-drive offenders from 2008 to 2013, Hampshire (276 offenders), Devon and Cornwall (241) and Sussex (160). Nextbase said the total number of underage drink driving incidents had fallen year-on-year, but a number of police areas had seen an increase from 2012 to 2013. Toll: The statistics showed there were an average of five drink drivers under 18 caught each week since 2008 . These included South Yorkshire (where a number of 14, 15 and 16-year-olds were caught in 2013), Northumbria, Thames Valley, Kent, North Yorkshire, West Mercia, Staffordshire, South Wales, Cheshire and Cambridgeshire. Merseyside, Devon and Cornwall saw the greatest fall in offending individuals between 2012 and 2013. A spokesman from one of the police force's Freedom of Information offices said the nature of drink driving convictions in under-18s is such that they will often be found in conjunction with other convictions. The cluster of offences committed by underage drink drivers may include unlawful possession of a vehicle, driving without a licence, driving without insurance and illegal purchase of alcohol, as well as driving in excess of the legal limit. Nextbase spokesman Bryn Brooker said: ‘Uninsured drivers on UK roads pose a huge threat to the safety of the vast majority of responsible motorists and pedestrians. ‘These threats come in many forms and today's findings go to show that it's not just those who illegally choose not to buy insurance. Motorists have to be aware of such threats and take appropriate measures to mitigate the risk.’","Figures obtained under Freedom of Information Act from 43 police forces .

"England face the ultimate test in rugby on Saturday afternoon as the All Blacks visit HQ looking for a fifth consecutive victory over the Red Rose. New Zealand boast an astonishing 759 caps in their starting XV - while England have less than half that number with 358. Richie McCaw is the All Blacks' most experienced player with 134 caps, but England's? Well, that is their often controversial hooker, Northampton's Dylan Hartley. Dylan Hartley (right) will be England's most-experienced player when they face New Zealand on Saturday . The Northampton hooker has 57 caps for England but has often been a controversial figure . He was sin-binned during England's World Cup pool match against Georgia in 2011 . VIDEO O2 Inside Line Season 5, Episode 1 . The 28-year-old has the most caps in Stuart Lancaster's side - 57 - and, as well as being one of the key figures in England's on-field 'leadership team', he is the de facto vice-captain. For England to put so much responsibility on the shoulders of a man born in the heart of the country he faces on Saturday, in Rotorua on New Zealand's North Island, it is strange enough anyway. He is, without a shadow of a doubt, a magnificent front-row forward. His lineout throwing is exemplary, he carries the ball well and he offers England much-needed go-forward ball. He also captained Northampton to the 2014 Premiership title. There is no doubt that he deserves to be in England's starting XV. Hartley (second right) did captain Northampton to the 2014 Aviva Premiership title, however . Yet when you add in Hartley's at-best shady career disciplinary record, it becomes an even more curious situation that he has such a prominent position in the team. Lesser players would surely have been cast aside by now. In total, Hartley's on-field indiscretions have led to  a combined 48 weeks' worth of suspensions. He has been suspended four times, including once in an England shirt. While playing for the Red Rose in the 2012 Six Nations, Hartley bit Ireland flanker Stephen Ferris and was given an eight-week ban. Hartley looks on having been sent off for allegedly swearing at a match official in the 2013 Premiership final . The hooker (left) sits on the bench having allegedly told Wayne Barnes that he was a 'f****** cheat' Perhaps his most infamous suspension, however, came while in a Northampton shirt. During the 2013 Aviva Premiership final at Twickenham - the venue of Saturday's contest with the All Blacks - Hartley was sent off for verbally abusing a match official. He allegedly turned to referee Wayne Barnes before half-time of the match against Leicester and said: 'You f****** cheat.' This indiscretion was punished with a further 13-week suspension and cost him a place on the victorious 2013 British and Irish Lions tour to Australia. Hartley (centre) gets in a fight with Cardiff Blues captain Paul Tito during a match in April 2010 . Add to that the 26-week ban he received for eye gouging Wasps forwards James Haskell and Jonny O'Connor in April 2007 and the two weeks he was given for punching Ulster hooker Rory Best during a Heineken Cup encounter and the total time period adds up to almost a year out for indiscretions. Hartley must prove his worth to England by delivering when it matters most. They are less than 12 months away from a World Cup on home soil and they need to make a point to the All Blacks. It is time for Hartley to stand up and be counted. Hartley deserves to be in the England team due to his exemplary throwing and team contribution .","England host New Zealand at Twickenham on Saturday (2.30pm kick-off)

"A mother-of-eight has been ordered to appear in court on charges that she forced her adoptive daughter to eat cat litter and attempted to sew the girl's mouth shut. As Rana Cooper, 46, left court in Washington County, Pennsylvania following the preliminary hearing on Thursday and told reporters: 'I am a good mother, a very good mother.' Immediately after the hearing, her 51-year-old husband, Richard Cooper, was arraigned on a charge of endangering the welfare of a child after he allegedly failed to stop the abuse. The 16-year-old girl, who was adopted by the couple when she was 10, explained that she was abused because the woman considered her 'embarrassing to the family', which has seven sons. Scroll down for video . Accused: Rana Cooper, 46, told reporters outside court on Thursday that she 'is a very good mother' - but her adopted teenage daughter claims she force-fed her cat litter and toothpaste and physically attacked her . 'She scooped cat litter with a scooper and shoved it in my mouth while holding my throat,' the girl claimed in the court, WPXI reported. As the court was shown images of wounds to the girl's arms and legs, she described other alleged abuse, the channel reported. 'Any time mom was yelling or choking me or punishing me, the dog would bite me and latch ahold of my arm and tear into my skin,' she said. I have scars and a big hole in my leg because of it.' Prosecutors said that Cooper forced her daughter to earn points to eat, drink and use the bathroom, and that she once attempted to sew her mouth shut with a needle and thread but stopped after piercing her bottom lip. The girl added that her father threatened to leave because Cooper wouldn't stop hurting the girl. 'My mom was mad and bit my nose, twisting my neck and dragged me across the room,' she said. Rana Cooper, from Avella, received bail of $100,000. In court: Cooper is seen leaving court on Thursday with her husband Richard behind her, right . 'I don't think this child understood how horrific these things were,' Traci McDonald, an assistant Washington County district attorney, said, the Observer-Reporter reported. 'She thought it was discipline.' As she left court, she told reporters that she was a 'very good mother' and the only time she held her child's head under water - as the teenager has claimed - was to wash her hair. The alleged treatment came to light in May while child welfare authorities in Washington County were investigating an alleged assault at the girl's school. State police Cpl. Robert Copechil said he interviewed officials at the girl's school and was able to verify her story through a guidance counselor's notes and concerns a teacher had noted. Cooper was charged with assault, child endangerment and reckless endangerment. Police reports have detailed even more sickening incidents, including how she allegedly forced the teenage girl to scrape the inside of a toilet and eat what was on her finger. In other incidents, she allegedly sat on the child for minutes at a time, force fed her until she vomited, made her eat half a tube of toothpaste and jammed a Q-tip into her ear causing partial loss of hearing. According to the girl, Cooper bit her nose until it bled, hit her in the face with a metal belt buckle and forced her to stand in the corner on drywall screws. The mother also allegedly threatened to gouge the teen's eyes out and slice off her tongue. 'If it was time to eat and no one else was around, mother would allow child to eat and would make the child shovel food quickly into her mouth,' wrote state police Cpl. Robert Copechil. Scene: The girl was adopted by the couple in 2008, when she was 10, and claims that she has since endured years of abuse. Her father has also been charged for failing to do anything about the abuse . 'Mother would then make the child tell mother that she was eating one of her brothers.' Rana Cooper gave police a written statement last month in which she admitted to holding her daughter's head under water for three to 10 seconds, police said. However, Cooper's 24-year-old son, Ronnie, has come to his mother's defense insisting that the allegations of abuse against her were false. 'Nothing, none of that happened,' Ronnie Cooper told KDKA. 'None of these are true.' The girl has since been removed from the home and put in the care of an older brother and another caretaker. Washington County Children and Youth Services have removed all of the other children under 18 from the home.

"Staring at myself in the mirror, I’m shocked to see how different I look compared to five minutes ago. My eyes appear more intense, my face paler. I’m thinking Scandinavian, I’m thinking Queen Elizabeth I, but brow expert Sohan Chong puts her finger on it. ‘Weird,’ she announces, staring at my new bleached eyebrows. ‘They bring out the blue of your eyes, although you do look a bit like an alien.’ Eyebrows have become 2014’s most confusing beauty story. At the beginning of the year the ‘Scouse brow’ — the high-arched, pencilled-in look so beloved by Liverpool ladies, WAGs and TOWIE women — was still in fashion. Scroll down for video . Stephanie Theobald with her eyebrows bleached (left) and dyed (right). This year's catwalk eyebrows trends have gone from one extreme to the other . Then model-of-the-moment Cara Delevingne’s unkempt version took off and we were all meant to walk around looking like we’d never seen a tweezer in our lives. Apparently, a brave few even tried the Vulcan brow, which is exactly as it sounds — curiously angled brows inspired by Star Trek’s Spock. Thankfully, they never really took off. Finally, last month Cara sashayed down the Givenchy runway at Paris Fashion Week with her iconic eyebrows bleached, hailing the arrival of the ‘No Brow’. Yes, you read that correctly, when it comes to grooming, fashionable women are increasingly skipping the tweezers and reaching for the peroxide instead and bleaching out their brows completely. Stephanie with her eyebrows kept natural. She has noticed that they are beginning to thin out with age . Suman Jalaf from Neville Hair And Beauty in Knightsbridge, West London — who works with Poppy Delevingne, Suki Waterhouse and Kelly Brook — says there is a trend towards intense eyebrow maintenance because a groomed brow offers ‘the cheapest alternative to a facelift. They define your features and frame your face.’ But which look should I go for? I went to one of London’s top hair salons to find out. I must admit my eyebrows are worrying me. While I’ve always had naturally thick, curly hair, at 48 my eyebrows have started to look thin. They are still OK at the nose end but, towards my ears, the hairs seem to peter out. I haven’t dared pluck them or touch my eyebrows with a pencil in years, hoping that people will be distracted by my hair. I’m not sure they’re ready for the spotlight. At the Jo Hansford salon in London, things get off to a bad start when the redoubtable Jo — hair colourist to everyone from the Duchess of Cornwall to Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie — inspects the guinea pig. ‘You don’t have many eyebrows to speak of!’ she declares, before walking off. Ouch. It’s only when Sohan Chong appears that I relax. She takes one look and says: ‘They’re not thinning at all. They just need tidying up.’ I feel a weight taken off my shoulders. Maybe I am normal after all. Half of Sohan’s clients complain of balding brows. ‘They stop growing so well once you reach 40,’ she says, because of dropping levels of oestrogen. ‘And lots of young girls over-pluck them.’ Sohan’s brows are arched and well-defined. The type a cool corporate lawyer might sport. She tells me they’re part-hair and part-tattoo. Sohan offers customers a tattoo service for £400 that needs touching up once every six months. It sounds tempting, but I don’t feel ready to commit yet. Instead, I’m escorted to the basins where Jo is going to peroxide my brows. Stephanie wasn't a fan of the bleached look which she said made her look like an alien . The process works the same way as other hair bleaching: a hydrogen peroxide paste is painted onto my eyebrows, which seeps into the hair shaft and disperses the colour molecules. The more colour molecules that get dispersed, the lighter your hair will become. It feels cold and slightly tingly but quite comfortable, and 20 minutes later I am declared ‘done’. Jo returns with a warm cloth and wipes the bleach off. ‘You look like you don’t have any brows now!’ she says, with a booming laugh. I’m sensing she’s not a fan of my new look which, she tells me, has been copied by several ‘trendy types’ since Cara made her statement. But in general most people still do want to go the other way, i.e. dye blonde brows darker so their faces appear more striking, like Rita Ora and Jayne Mansfield. Bleached or dark, there is no doubt women are paying much more attention to their brows nowadays. Many tend to get a ‘brow do’ at the same time as their hair, a service that costs £15. ‘Good eyebrows make you look healthy and feel confident,’ Sohan says. A report by market research company NPD Group shows that sales of brow products rose by 52 per cent between January and May. When I see mine in the mirror, I get a shock. Sohan’s right: bleached brows do bring out the colour of my eyes. And they emphasise my forehead as there’s nothing separating my eyes from my hairline. At home, my boyfriend informs me I look less like Elizabeth I and more like Robocop, with his helmet removed. He’s got a point. It doesn’t take me long to figure out the No Brow look just doesn’t suit me — if indeed it suits anyone. Katy Perry soon went back to black after dabbling with the No Brow this summer, as did Cara after the Givenchy show. I decide the blonde look is too bizarre even for the 21st century. Possibly in a spirit of over- compensation, I return to the salon and ask Sohan to give me the alternative Scouse Brow. She tells me she prefers to call it a ‘Power Brow’ and begins drawing over my brows with a heavy black pencil, going slightly over the edge of my natural shape. As a guideline, the natural shape should be followed when creating a ‘Power Brow’, but Sohan says ‘don’t worry about elongating the thin end’, as this look is about being overly dramatic. I was prepared to hate it, but the big black brows against blonde hair make me feel powerful — like Madonna circa the Blond Ambition tour. Yet as I cycle home, I’m aware of an older woman looking at me quizzically at the traffic lights. At the local corner shop I jokingly ask two twentysomething office workers if they think my big brows look ridiculous. ‘What do you mean?’ says one of them blankly, as if I’m an idiot. ‘That’s what eyebrows are supposed to look like these days, isn’t it? It’s down to that Cara de la whatshername.’ I’m glad I’ve put myself through the eyebrow mill. I never realised there was so much potential in an eyebrow and I’ve learned that they really are important, more important than mascara on lashes for lighting up your eyes and face. Stephanie says the the big black brows against blonde hair make her feel more powerful . Next month, London’s eyebrow queen, Vaishaly Patel — whose clients include Gwyneth Paltrow, Nigella Lawson and Elle MacPherson — will be pioneering ‘eyebrow extensions’ where synthetic hair is stuck onto existing brows. It lasts for up to three weeks and costs £60. She’ll also offer a stick-on brow service. Although the full-on Cara may be a step too far, I will definitely pay more attention to my eyebrows in future, and have booked an appointment with Jo Hansford to get my brows tinted back to my natural shade. If I’m brave enough, I might even try a tattoo top-up, but am still undecided. I’ve always prided myself on being low maintenance in the beauty department, but have decided to add brows to my bi-monthly hair colouring treat. I hope it’s not the start of a slippery slope!","This year's catwalk eyebrows trends have been at both extremes .

"Benefits Street star Deirdre Kelly today revealed she could switch to supporting UKIP in the wake of two shock defections by Tory MPs. Speaking at an event at the Conservative party conference in Birmingham, Miss Kelly, who found fame as White Dee on the controversial show, hit out at the way the government had sought to impose sanctions on benefit claims. She condemned Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith for being 'out of touch with the real world' and demanded greater job variety 'because not everybody wants to work in an office or build a wall'. Scroll down for video . Benefits Street star Deirdre Kelly used an event at the Tory party conference to attack government policy, and int she is planning to switch to UKIP . Miss Kelly was invited to address a fringe meeting hosted by the Policy Exchange think tank entitled: 'What more needs to be done to help people into work?' She said: 'I like to speak for myself but Mr Farage doesn't seem to be doing a bad job. He has had a few extra members joining recently, hasn't he?' At the weekend Tory MP Mark Reckless announced he was defecting to UKIP, following Douglas Carswell who jumped ship in August. Miss Kelly said she 'very well could' vote Ukip at the election, and told the audience she was 'not a massive fan' of Labour leader Ed Miliband. Asked about benefit cuts, Ms Kelly criticised Mr Duncan Smith, who has overseen the Government's welfare reforms. 'You have someone who I think is completely out of touch with the real world making decisions on people who do actually live in the real world ... that's Iain Duncan Smith, isn't it?' Ms Kelly told the audience that job centres 'have to get more in touch with the real person'. 'I have experienced some not very nice job centres,' she said. 'You do just go in, you sit down, you are looked down upon. 'They just need to understand that, just because you are on benefits does not mean that you are not a real person. Just because you are on benefits doesn't mean that you are not physically looking for a job.' Asked about the welfare changes introduced since 2010, she said: 'I have noticed a change. I think it's considerably got worse.' Benefits Street star Deirdre Kelly told Tory activists that Iain Duncan Smith is out of touch and jobcentres offer the wrong sorts of jobs . She addressed the packed Policy Exchange event on: 'What more needs to be done to help people into work?' She criticised the way sanctions were applied to people for failing to fulfil their obligations under the system. 'I think people are too quick to sanction people who are looking for jobs. You do have to deal with it on an individual basis,' she said. 'There are people out there who are very happy to sit at home and receive their benefits and not physically look for a job. But I know people who apply for 20, 30 jobs a week. 'You can't force an employer to give you a job, so what you have to do is make sure the resources are there to enable the jobseeker to get a job, be a bit more realistic with what kind of schemes are available to them, because not everybody wants to work in an office or build a wall.' She added: 'It's not fair that someone works a 40-hour, if not more, week and doesn't have as much to live on as someone who sits at home, doesn't work and is given money from the Government. 'But that's not that individual's fault, that is the Government's fault. I think the Government also has to look at (the) minimum wage and things like that. 'It's the Government that says how much someone is entitled to to live on, not the individual.' Miss Kelly said jobcentres have to be realistic about the roles they offer, because 'not everybody wants to work in an office or build a wall' Douglas Carswell became the first Conservative to defect to UKIP last month, sparking speculation that up to eight MPs were considering leaving the party . Ms Kelly has hinted in the past that she would consider running for Parliament, and told the gathering in Birmingham: 'It's something I would think about, but obviously I wouldn't object to starting at the bottom - I wouldn't want to go straight in and have David Cameron's job. 'I would think about it because I am interested in politics and I am interested in normal people and I am interested in the country.' She said she would form her own party if she decided to stand and dismissed criticism of her background, saying: 'Just because you are a little bit common doesn't mean that you are stupid and you wouldn't be able to have a good input. I think the more common you are the more in touch you are with real people, so yes it would be something I would consider.' She added: 'You can never be liked by 100 per cent of people, I think most MPs know that.'","Deirdre Kelly tells fringe event how Nigel Farage is not doing a bad job .

"Muslims around the world are celebrating Islam's biggest holiday with prayers, gifts, traditional visits with family and friends, and feasts. Eid al-Adha, or Feast of Sacrifice, commemorates what Muslims believe was Prophet Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice his son in accordance with God’s will, though in the end God provides him with a sheep to sacrifice instead.

That's the call from Gun Control Australia as a Senate Committee looks into 'the ability of Australian law enforcement authorities to eliminate gun-related violence in the community'. 'They are the weapons of choice for gangs, especially for drive-by shootings,' group spokeswoman Samantha Lee told Daily Mail Australia. The Desert Eagle semi-automatic handgun is referred to as a 'hand cannon' by some enthusiasts, is capable of five shots in less than a second and will cost between $800 and $2000 . 'The restrictions that were placed are pretty much useless - they are still widely and legally available right across Australia' according to Gun Control Australia officials . A ban on the ownership of semi-automatic rifles was brought in as Australian law in 1996 after the Port Arthur massacre in Tasmania in which Martin Bryant killed 35 people . 'They are so lightweight and easy to conceal and easy to use in a moving car' says Samantha Lee of semi-automatic handguns, which the anti-gun lobby want banned in Australia . One semi-automatic handgun readily available is the Desert Eagle .50 calibre, which is referred to in some quarters as a 'hand cannon' and is capable of five shots in less than one second and according to one enthusiast 'can punch holes in an engine block'. 'They are so lightweight and easy to conceal and easy to use in a moving car,' Ms Lee added. She claims that there are between 40,000 to 50,000 registered handgun owners in most states and territories. Semi-automatic handguns should be banned in Australia, according to Gun Control Australia . 'There's been a significant increase in New South Wales alone, and the figures have risen in Victoria and Queensland too,' she said. But the Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia (SSAA) which represents 160,000 plus members has countered by saying 'they are very high on rhetoric and very shallow on evidence'. Tim Bannister of the SSAA told Daily Mail Australia 'it's ideological, based on no real argument'. He says the problem is at the borders and the illegal importation of weapons. 'Handguns are the least likely firearm to be stolen from licensed owners. Banning self-loading handguns from civilian ownership would have little effect on the number of illegally held firearms in Australia, when Customs is so ill-equipped and under-resourced to capture any more than 13 per cent of prohibited items that are imported into Australia on an annual basis,' Mr Bannister said. He cited a raid in Sydney's south in 2012 where 'police were able to break an importation ring in Sylvania Waters, seizing 140 Glock pistols'. Mr Bannister said 'criminals use handguns mostly as a status symbol and using them against other drug dealers'. A joint Queensland Police and Australian Federal Police (AFP) investigation earlier in the year led to the seizure of more than 100 illegal firearms across south-east Queensland . Pump-action shotguns like this one uncovered by the AFP in a recent raid are outlawed in Australia . Anti-gun lobby groups say up to 1800 guns are reported stolen from licensed shooters each year . Lobbyists have told a Senate inquiry that gun-related violence cannot be stopped by simply increasing law enforcement resources . Anti-gun lobbyists say Australia's biggest problem 'is how these guns fall into the black-market, one is theft but the other is the main serious concern, there are rogue firearms dealers' Ms Lee claims that 'there were some restrictions placed on handguns after 2002 when a student in Monash University opened fire using semi-automatic handguns - however the restrictions that were placed are pretty much useless - they are still widely and legally available right across Australia'. She also warned authorities that 'they're the same type of firearm used in the Port Arthur massacre, except they are smaller, which in some ways makes them even more dangerous because they are easier to conceal'. The Howard Government banned semi-automatic rifles in 1996 after the Port Arthur massacre, in which Martin Bryant killed 35 people and wounded 23 more. 'The main concern is the proliferation of semi-automatic handguns, that ban (1996) was for semi-automatic long-arms and shotguns but did not extend to handguns,' Ms Lee said. 'We did have some strong laws for handguns then, however since those laws have been superseded by laws around semi-automatic rifles.' GCA says Australia should follow the UK lead, which effectively wiped out the private ownership of handguns after the Dunblane massacre, also in 1996, in which Thomas Hamilton opened fire at Dunblane Primary School, killing 16 children and a teacher before turning the weapon on himself. 'The UK banned semi-automatic handguns and banned the sport which uses handguns,' Ms Lee said. 'The problem is how these guns fall into the black-market, one is theft but the other is the main serious concern,there are rogue firearms dealers who have passed on large numbers of firearms into the black-market.' But Mr Bannister added 'less than point two of a per cent of Australia’s licensed firearm owners are affected by theft each year'. 'Handguns, and particularly self-loading handguns, are the most highly regulated of all firearms in Australia,' he said. 'Target shooting with self-loading handguns is an area of international competition that Australia excels in. 'The Commonwealth and Olympic Games feature several events that require the use of self-loading handguns.' Handguns are classified Category H under Australian law, permissible for target shooters and some (such as security guards) who can prove need for work purposes . The shotgun remains one of the most widely owned firearms in Australia, it falls under Category A in national gun laws where an owner must prove a 'genuine reason' for its possession . 'There has been various cases across Australia where firearms dealers have been charged with moving handguns into the black-market. So what we need to do is ban them, the same way that we banned semi-automatic long-arms,' Ms Lee continued. 'There's absolutely no difference between the two firearms except for length, yet we have a situation in Australia where the semi-automatic long-arms are banned because they are too dangerous yet hand-guns are legally available.' Ms Lee says she is not advocating the end of gun ownership in Australia. 'In terms of the handgun, it's the same as the rifle, you can get a single shot handgun,' she said. 'The main reason they are used in Australia is for shooting sports, we're not saying we should get rid of that sport, all we are asking for is that for the high-powered military style hand-gun to be banned. 'Single shot rifles are more widely owned across Australia but the concern with the semi-automatics is the massacres because they are so high-powered they can kill and maim a number of people in just a short amount of time. The community safety issues regarding them are the main concerns.' And she doesn't accept the notion that a new ban would cripple the local gun market. 'Most guns are not produced in Australia, most come through China and the US - the main concern would be coming from sporting shooters who desire the semi-automatic handguns,' Ms Lee insisted. Samantha Lee of GCA says 'sport should take the lesser position, if you compare it with public safety' 'But we say that sport should take the lesser position, if you compare it with public safety. Again we're not saying you can't use a handgun for sport but not for competitions which require semi-automatic handguns.' Ms Lee claims her point has been made by some sporting shooters who have told her 'that it isn't a problem because sporting shooting is about accuracy not about power of the firearm'. 'We do have to be sensible about this issue.' Gun-makers say Australia could miss out on major weapons manufacturing opportunities if stricter gun ownership restrictions including a ban on hand guns are introduced. Beretta International says there is potential to open a plant in Victoria, but would reconsider if legislative changes had an effect on its business models. 'Beretta International is seriously considering locating a manufacturing plant here, in Victoria in particular,' said Beretta Australia general manager Greg Chan. 'A company as big as Beretta and as old as Beretta would seriously look at Australia if they changed the legislation in an adverse way (and say) `why would they want to come here? Why would they want to build a massive facility here if that's going to affect us?"" Winchester Australia also says its existing manufacturing business could also be affected if further restrictions on gun ownership were brought in. 'Any changes would obviously put our business at some sort of risk,' sales and marketing manager Jeffrey Gordon said. Gun manufacturers and consultants told the Senate inquiry that processes already in place could be improved to prevent registered firearms being stolen and used to commit crimes. 'If you're worried about firearm theft, enforce the law that's already there,' Mr Chan said. Manufacturing consultants criticised Australia's existing registration processes. 'The quality of information gathered by most of the registries in Australia are pathetic,' Beretta consultant Russell Pearson said. National Firearm Dealers Association president Luca Scribani Rossi said responsibility for the management of firearm registries should be removed from police and passed to authorities responsible for operating and managing licensing systems.","More than three million guns are in Australian hands .

"A woman in her 20s somehow escaped unharmed when her car somersaulted off the road and into a pensioner's living room as he sat watching the National Lottery with his wife. Shocking pictures show the the damage caused when the white Mini Cooper ploughed into the front of John and Pamela Clifford's £400,000 property in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham, on Wednesday night. The woman driver, who miraculously only suffered minor injuries, had somehow managed to travel 200 yards from the roadside to the house, smashing through a garden wall and even flattening a tree on the way. The white Mini Cooper ploughed into the front of the £400,000 property in Sutton Coldfield but, incredibly, neither the driver of the elderly couple who lives inside were seriously hurt . The motorist, in her 20s, was taken by ambulance to Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham, as a precautionary check-up but had suffered only minor injuries . The driver had travelled 200 yards from the roadside, through a garden wall and into the house, leaving Mr Clifford's door lying on the ground and debris piled up in front of the property . Homeowner Mr Clifford, 76, said his house shook from the force of the devastating impact, causing thousands of pounds worth of damage. Mr Clifford, a grandfather-of-four and part-time supply teacher, said he was 'just inches' from the destroyed wall, adding: 'We might not have won the lottery that night but in a way I think our luck was in because we could quite have easily been killed.' He added: 'I was standing there checking my lottery numbers but none of them came up. 'The next thing I know there's a car smashing through my home. 'I just heard a massive crashing noise which sounded like an explosion - like a bomb going off. 'The whole of my house shook and shuddered from the force of the impact so I went outside to see what was going on. Mr Clifford described the toilet wall as being 'completely trashed' and said he had 'popped in there moments before' the Mini Cooper came hurtling into his house . After leaving the road, the car carried on and ploughed through a wall before narrowly missing a block of flats next to the Clifford house and then finally coming to rest when it hit the home . 'I saw this woman standing on top of her car, which was on the side, just in absolute hysterics. 'She didn't seem injured which was incredible really. I don't even know how she got out the vehicle. It was a total wreck. 'The young lady had managed to travel about 200 yards from the road, across an area of lawn and on the way she even flattened a pretty big tree. 'I don't know how that didn't stop her but she's carried on and ploughed through a wall before narrowly missing a block of flats next to us. 'She's then smashed into our house. Looking at the impact, which is pretty high up she's hit the wall while in mid-air. 'That just makes it even more incredible that she wasn't injured and I'm pretty lucky to escape without a scratch as well.' Reflecting on just how incredibly lucky he was, Mr Clifford said: 'If it had been seconds earlier or if I was standing a few inches to the left I wouldn't be here to tell the story.' John Clifford, 76, stands outside the house he has lived in with his wife Pamela for 39 years, which has now had thousands of pounds worth of damage caused to it . Speaking about the driver who caused all the damage Mr Clifford said: 'She didn't seem injured which was incredible really. I don't even know how she got out the vehicle. It was a total wreck.' Sutton Coldfield Fire Station tweeted a dramatic image in the aftermath of the smash - which completely destroyed the porch of the house and left the inside of the property clearly visible. The front door could also be seen lying amid rubble and the smashed-up vehicle on its side with it's airbags deployed. Meanwhile, the motorist, in her 20s, was taken by ambulance to Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham, as a precautionary check-up. Mr Clifford said: 'The toilet wall was completely trashed and I had popped in there moments before the impact. 'But where I was standing when the car hit was a matter of inches from the wall - there was dust and rubble everywhere. My house was showered in bricks. The car caused carnage as it knocked down a tree on its way across the road, seeminlgy somersaulting through the air and landing in Mr and Mrs Clifford's Sutton Coldfield house . 'If it had been seconds earlier or if I was standing a few inches to the left I wouldn't be here to tell the story. 'God knows what had happened if my wife had not gone up to bed early to read as well, she would have been in the direct line of impact.' Mr Clifford has lived at the property with his wife Pamela, 75, a retired library assistant, for 39 years. He said he now expected the cost of the damage to run into thousands after his patio, front wall and downstairs toilet wall were completely destroyed. The pensioner, who has two grown up sons Peter, 48 and Paul, 50, added: 'We're still waiting on the insurers but it's going to be a lot of money. 'The front door has gone, the patio had been demolished and there's just a gaping hole where anybody can see into our lounge. 'We need to get something done because out house is completely exposed. 'I just have no idea how the woman managed to travel so far from the road, somersault her car through the air and walk away with barely a scratch. Bricks from the house walls were left strewn along the ground outside, ending up on Mr Clifford's car along with dust and dirt thrown up from the car's impact . An out-of-date tax disc could be seen on the Mini Cooper car after it ploughed into the house and was left lying on its side, with its owner walking away surprisingly unhurt . An oxygen mask could be seen discarded in the driveway of John and Pamela Clifford's house after fire crews, police  and paramedics attended the scene at 10.30pm . 'She is a very lucky lady and so are we. 'The damage is bad but we have escaped with our lives.' Emergency services were called at around 10.30pm to find the detached house and car severely damaged. A West Midlands Police spokeswoman said: 'We were called by the ambulance service to Thorn Hill Road at around 10.30pm last night following reports of a car in collision with a house. 'Officers dealt with the collision and it is believed that there were minor injuries caused to the driver. 'The driver was spoken to at the scene and enquiries into the circumstances around the collision continue.' A spokesperson for West Midlands Fire Service said emergency crews spent an hour working at the scene. He added: 'Both the homeowner and driver were lucky to escape the incident with minor injuries.' A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service said: 'Two ambulances, a paramedic and a rapid response vehicle attended the scene at around 10.30pm. 'The patient was not seriously injured but was taken to Good Hope Hospital for a check up as a precautionary measure.'","White Mini Cooper travelled 200 yards, smashed through a garden wall and into living room of house .

"A former Great Britain runner jumped on to railway tracks and was hit by a train when he was told his prostate cancer had returned. Former Welsh 1,500m champion Clive Thomas spiralled into depression after doctors broke the devastating news that his cancer had resurfaced and he would need to start chemotherapy. The father-of-two, who went on to coach aspiring athletes at the prestigious Millfield public school in Somerset, had been become increasingly paranoid that the anti-depressants he was taking would cause him to harm himself or his loved ones, an inquest heard. Clive Thomas (pictured right) jumped from a bridge and lay undiscovered until he was stuck by a morning train . After growing paranoid and warning his partner Susan Adams to 'protect herself' from him, he fled her home in Basingstoke, Hampshire, and was discovered hours later on the railway tracks  around five miles away. The inquest in Basingstoke today heard how Mr Thomas probably jumped from a bridge in the middle of the night and lay undiscovered until he was struck by an early morning train. He was still alive when emergency services arrived on the scene but had suffered devastating head injuries and died on the tracks as paramedics tried to resuscitate him. The former long distance runner represented Great Britain in a 3,000m steeplechase race in Dieppe, France in 1975, recording a time of eight minutes and 37 seconds which would have made him the fastest Welshman in 2014. He once ran a mile in four minutes and one second and the 5,000 metres in 13 minutes and 42 seconds. He was also a coach and vice-chairman at the running club Wells City Harriers, where he helped bring through Team GB runners Frank and Ben Tickner. His partner Susan Adams told the hearing how she had met Mr Thomas in 2010 when they were introduced to each other by a mutual friend. The former runner was recovering from the death of his wife and Mrs Adams, herself widowed, was asked to provide moral support. Their romance quickly blossomed after they went on a Caribbean cruise together, but the couple did not marry. She said the 67-year-old, who had previously been sectioned under the Mental Health Act after suffering depression, had been talking about having 'black thoughts' in the days before his death. 'He said he didn't feel right since the biopsy but couldn't give an exact reason for not feeling right. He was worried about the cancer, his mortality, a long drawn out death and being locked up again for mental health issues.' After his running career, Mr Thomas taught at the prestigious Millfield School (pictured) in Somerset . In a statement read out to the inquest, experienced train driver Dave Keats said he had originally thought there was a bag of chips on the line, before realising when he was 'about 10 feet away' that it was the body of a man. Speaking about the incident, which took place on September 21 this year, he said: 'I originally thought it was a young male who had been drinking and fallen off the bridge. There hadn't been any trains in that area for seven hours or so, so I thought the male could have been there for quite some time.' North Hampshire Coroner Andrew Bradley said: 'He clearly steals away from home in a very agitated state, there are a variety of things he could have done but what he does is go down to the railway line and jumps from the bridge. It's not immediately outside his house, it's a journey he had to make...he had a plan.' A jury of four men and three women ruled that Mr Thomas killed himself whilst the balance of his mind was disturbed. The inquest was attended by Mr Thomas' sons Neal, 40, and Alan, 38, who both live in London. After the hearing Neal said: 'He was a much-loved man. It's a big loss to us. Today has been difficult, but we can kind of move forward a little bit now that we've got the verdict.'

"IT has just sold for over half a million pounds – more than double the average British home. So you might be expecting to see something with a little grandeur. But this property is actually a dilapidated garage, and justifies its hefty price tag by being in the upmarket borough of Chelsea. This dilapidated old shed in Chelsea has been snapped up for £550,000 before it had a chance to go under the hammer . The shed has become the nation's most expensive lockup after selling for three times the average value of a British home . The ramshackle unit is tucked behind a row of terraced houses and doesn’t even have access for a car. Described as an ‘irregularly shaped, broadly level site’, the plot is just 538 square feet – but was snapped up by an investor even before going under the hammer. It was supposed to be sold off by Allsop auctioneers yesterday, but was bought in advance for close to the asking price of £550,000. The site – near Chelsea’s famous King’s Road – comes with planning permission for an unusual two-bedroom home with a single storey at ground level and a basement. Once complete, one of the bedrooms will have an en suite bathroom, while there will also be a living room, kitchen, a ‘green’ roof and a patio. However it could arguably be called a bargain, as the average home on the street costs £3.5million – up £507,000 in the last year, and £1.1million since 2009. Computer generated digital plans show the proposed design for the shed, which the new owner plans to turn into an unusual home . The unique new home, which sits on a site measuring 0.013 acres, will feature two bedrooms, one of which will have an ensuite . Recent figures from the Office for National Statistics show house prices in the capital have risen by more than 20 per cent in the last year, with the average London home now costing £514,000. By contrast, the average price for the UK as a whole is £274,000. The soaring costs mean that only those earning more than £100,000 a year can afford a typical mortgage in the city, according to the National Housing Federation.

It is tucked at the end of an alleyway between Lamont Road and King's Road in Chelsea, one of London's most desirable areas . The garage is located on land behind these houses. It is to be demolished to make way for a small new home . And the sale of the shed is just the latest in a string of extraordinary property deals. Last month, a flat in Islington measuring just 188 square feet – less than half the size of a train carriage – was sold for more than a quarter of a million pounds. The tiny property is so compact that the front door opens underneath the bed, which is on a mezzanine. Estate agents said it received a huge amount of interest before selling for £275,000.","A small garage located off King's Road, Chelsea has sold for £550,000 - three times average price of a home in Britain .

"Traditionally, women sought cosmetic surgery to emulate the lithe limbed models that adorn their favourite glossy magazines. But times are changing. Cosmetic salons have seen a huge increase in enquiries for fat transfer over the last 12 months, suggesting a rise in popularity for softer, more natural-looking cosmetic procedures. The treatment, for which enquiries have soared by 324 per cent, is a simple procedure that works by transferring unwanted fat from other areas of the body to the breast and buttocks. New icons: Cosmetic surgery salons have seen a huge increase in enquiries for fat transfer as women seek a softer, more natural-looking silhouette like Elizabeth Taylor, left, and Marilyn Monroe, right . Women seeking the treatment aim to emulate the softer, more seductive silhouettes of movie stars from the Golden Era such as the likes of Elizabeth Taylor, Marilyn Monroe and Sophia Loren, who were all renowned for their natural breasts, slim waists and curvaceous bottoms and thighs. This minimally invasive procedure works by using Vaser Liposuction - a technique that uses ultrasound technology to breakdown fat cells, which are then removed from your body through a suction process - to remove the unwanted fat. This fat (perhaps from the thighs or stomach) is then injected into the area of your choice, usually the breast and buttocks. This rise in fat transfer enquiries is a departure from the nineties and naughties trend of high fashion slim frames, say cosmetic surgeons. The curvy look: Women seeking the treatment aim to emulate the softer, more seductive silhouettes of movie stars like Sophia Loren, left, who was renowned for her natural breasts, slim waist and curvaceous bottom and thighs, similar to Kim Kardashian, right . A spokesperson for EF Medispa, who offer the £1,500 treatment and noticed the spike in enquiries, said: 'Fat transfer, as well as being minimally invasive, is renowned for achieving a far more natural look than implants, which can often look obvious and harsh. 'It is the perfect combination, eradicating unwanted fat from one area and transferring it to your area of choice. 'With minimal risks, fat transfer is fast becoming a favoured alternative to cosmetic surgery for those looking to achieve the soft, curvy looks of celebrities such as those from the past and also modern muses such as Beyonce, Jennifer Lopez, Kate Upton, Sofia Vergara and Kim Kardashian, who are regularly named as the body inspirations by our customers.' Is the skinny look out of fashion?

"Jennifer Lopez experienced her first real heartbreak when the Academy Award winning actor and star of Gone Girl, Ben Affleck called off their very public engagement in January, 2004. The pain, tears and frustration only intensified when she realized that not only was the love affair over but so was the fairy tale family dream she had held onto throughout the intense media scrutiny that dubbed the couple ‘Bennifer.’ She hated that name. Scroll down for video . Supercouple: ‘It felt like my heart had been torn out of my chest,’ the singer/actress confesses in her first memoir, True Love . Hint hint: Affleck's eyes were definitely not on Jennifer in this PDA. She called him brilliantly smart, loving, charming, affectionate . Ring a ding ding: Affleck put a 6.1-carat diamond on her finger when they got engaged in November 2002 . ‘It felt like my heart had been torn out of my chest,’ the singer/actress confesses in her first memoir, True Love, published by Celebra, a Penguin Random House imprint. When asked about the man who placed a 6.1-carat pink damond on her finger she said, 'I'd probably say that he is brilliantly smart, loving, charming, affectionate. And I just admire him in every way. I respect him. I feel like he teaches me things.' Lopez, 45, started to fall apart after all the high hopes and dreams evaporated of being the perfect girlfriend, wife and mother. Months of planning had gone into her vision of a fairy tale wedding, the walk down the aisle and that anticipated moment at the altar of committing to each other forever. Affleck began dating Jennifer Garner just months after he broke it off with Lopez. When the couple married in the Turks and Caicos Islands in June, 2005, the new bride was four months pregnant with their first child, Violet. She feared being ridiculed in the press and envisioned headlines like ‘The Woman Who Has Everything But Can’t Get Love Right’! She was at rock bottom – for three days --- when record producer/singer/songwriter Marc Anthony walked back into her life. They were friends, worked on songs together and sang a duet in Spanish together, ‘No Me Ames’ or, ironically, ‘Don’t Love Me’ in English. ‘He was warm and funny, a brilliant singer and artist who knew how to make me feel special’, she writes. And he also made her laugh. Bomb: The couple met during the film of Gigli, a box office disaster, in 2002 . ‘He was so sure of everything, and at this moment, when I felt so lost, so broken and alone, there he was’. She believed maybe this was destiny stepping in and that she belonged with Marc and not with Ben Affleck. The first time she met Marc in 1998 backstage while he was performing on Broadway, his first words to her were ‘One day you’re going to be my wife’ – a good come-on. ‘The reality was I didn’t want to be alone’, she confesses, and she let herself be swept up in his charm and his arms believing he was her ‘knight in shining armor.’ There wasn’t that same passion she had with other men but she thought she could ‘build something real with him, something that would last’. Now she was back on target – and back under the dome -- for that fairy tale life she was chasing. Marc saved her from her immediate painful emotional depths and in return, Lopez believed she could love him forever. They married that same year, 2004, and she vowed that with two divorces and a broken engagement in the her past, she ‘was never going to give up on this love’. Marc was going to be her rock and they’d live happily ever after. But that only happens in fairytales…. True love: Ben began dating Jennifer Garner just months after he split with Jennifer Lopez . Baby on board: Garner was four month's pregnant with Violet when the couple married in June 2005 . Rebound: Jennifer and  Marc Anthony got together just days after Ben dumped her. They were married for seven years before they split . ‘Things between Marc and me weren’t perfect – our marriage was never the kind to glide along peacefully’. ‘From the beginning, it was tumultuous, passionate, and explosive’… . She recognized there were problems but they loved each other and she was willing to try to work it through so that she could make her dream of a family come true – whatever the cost. ‘Family is most important’ – was her mantra. Seven years later, in 2011, both knew the marriage was over. ‘My own happiness and sense of self-worth depended on how happy he was. So when Marc stated so clearly that he wasn’t happy, it broke me down completely’. Back to ‘dying inside, feeling lonely and miserable and sad', she thought she might never be happy again. But she had to get her ‘mojo’ back, she writes. She was exhausted and felt like a beached whale after having the twins. She needed to get back on stage – dance and sing. Skin game: Jennifer enters the Late Show With David Letterman on November 5 in New York City . She had to abandon the Hollywood diva concept in her head and head back to the Bronx to feel her roots once more – where she started, where she emerged as Jenny from the Block to step into the world’s music spotlight. In the Bronx, a friend suggested she see a psychic. His ‘vision’ was that she should go ahead with a world tour she had been planning because there was something important to be discovered while out on the road. More insightful was therapy that helped her discover that she suffered from low self-esteem. ‘I had never truly believed I was great at acting, or anything else for that matter’. ‘I was always looking for the other person to tell me I was great so I could feel good about myself. I lived for that’. She was finally learning self-love and it was heavenly being back on stage. She finally found a new beginning. ‘No matter what else happened, I had my friends, my family, my kids…I hadn’t figured everything out yet and still had a long road ahead, but I was going to be alright’.

"A quarter of children in the UK have never tasted a tomato and almost half have never tried lettuce. The shocking new statistics are a shameful insight into the daily diet of a child in the UK - a country where the government has spent millions of pounds in advertising to push the Five A Day guidelines. Ex-Blue Peter presenter Helen Skelton saw the human side to these figures when she toured Britain's primary schools recently as part of a campaign to get children eating healthily. Scroll down for video . Ex-Blue Peter presenter Helen Skelton is championing new healthy eating campaign across UK's schools, where she has encountered children who had never eat fruit or vegetables. Here she is pictured with children at Berrymede Junior School in London - one of the healthier schools from the programme . The TV star was confronted with kids who believed boiled sweets counted as fruit and others who had never eaten a vegetable in their lives. She said: 'I was in a bubble of naivety before I started visiting these schools, I did not realise that three in ten kids have never had a banana or that four in ten kids have never had broccoli - you take that for granted.' Helen was taking part in the Eat Like A Champ programme, introduced to help tackle the growing issue of poor nutrition and inactive lifestyles among children. The project helps to teach children about eating healthily by tailor-making special lessons for children aged 9-10 that introduce fruit and vegetables into the diet. After taking the course to several primary schools, Helen realised that a large proportion of our population are being brought up without any access to vegetables. She said: 'This one little boy at school in London told me he only liked Sams, which is basically the west London equivalent of KFC. Helen Skelton has been teaching children the value of eating healthily through the Eat Like A Champ programme . 'He said he was eating it five times a week, which is not only expensive, it's also just chicken in a bucket. At first he was adamant that he didn’t like healthy food and only liked Sams, but I just gave him some mango and suggested he try it. 'It wasn’t about me saying, ""This is healthy - eat this,"" I was more just saying, ""try this."" 'By the end of the class he was having tomatoes and soft cheese on crackers, so I watched him change his mind. 'With another little boy, I had to dare him to even get him to eat a blueberry. Helen Skelton first shot to fame on BBC children's show Blue Peter. The Eat Like A Champ programme makes nutrition exciting for kids by encouraging them to adopt the choices of famous champions they admire . 'By the end of the session I was watching him sneak handfuls of blueberries from behind our backs. 'It's hard for these kids because they have never even been given the option before. 'It’s about offering them tasty alternatives that also happen to be healthy.' While these accounts may seem shocking, the findings from the programme have shown that these children aren't alone. 450,000 kids in Britain have never tried any fruit or vegetables in their lifetime. Helen Skelton says some of the children she spoke to believed that strawberry sweets counted towards their Five A Day . 70 per cent of children have never eaten an aubergine or an avocado before, 42 per cent have never tasted a mushroom and 54 per cent have never tried celery. Even more worryingly, many children believe that they are actually  eating healthily because fruit-flavoured sweets count towards their five a day. Helen said: 'I don‘t think they realise what is a healthy choice is in a lot of cases. 'Strawberry sweets - so many kids think that counts, it’s quite sad. 'Kids think that when they eat things like strawberry tarts, that’s a great way to eat fruit when it most likely isn’t. 'When I’d ask if they helped to cook, they’d say that they did help out in the kitchen, but not one of them mentioned fruit or vegetables. 'They’d have coco pops for breakfast and chicken curry for dinner. When I asked if they put onion in their chicken curry, they’d even say no to that. 'No kid said that they ate vegetables. Or salad. 'They even said that they take the lettuce out of their sandwiches, I mean, lettuce is just water.' The Eat Like A Champ programme,  created by Danone in collaboration with the British Nutrition Foundation is free for schools to sign up to.","A quarter of Britain's children have never eaten a tomato .

"From showers that leak through walls to taps running brown water, it's just another day for renters with lazy landlords and real estate agents. After months of negotiating, numerous phone calls and emails, frustrated tenants have taken to social media to share their rental horror stories, with the hashtag #rentalproblems. Taking gardening to a whole new level, one woman found a batch of spring onions growing in her roof gutter, while another found all of her things eaten by termites. Almost half of all Australian renters are seemingly unaware of their rights when it comes to bonds, rent increases and repairs, new survey has found. Simply doing the dishes and taking a shower turned into a nightmare for one tenant with brown water pouring out of her taps . Another day inside a renters home... This was a dining room before (a party) the ceiling caved in . A CHOICE survey has found that 45 percent of tenants are finding it difficult to get by. CHOICE spokesman Tom Godfrey told Daily Mail Australia that it’s important for tenants to know their rights to avoid being treated unfairly or exploited when it comes to renting. ‘We’ve all heard rental horror stories of tenants being slapped with unexplained rent increases and struggling to get repairs completed,' he said. ‘Tenants need to know where they stand under the law because it’s a powerful position to be in and gives you confidence when you’re negotiating with the real estate or landlord. ‘It’s concerning that nearly half of Australians are finding it difficult but consumers can save a lot of money and time if they know a way around it. ' CHOICE have navigated the tricks and traps of renting and identified five points to ensure consumers get the most out of their tenancy. 'The five tips we've put together were the biggest concerns that we often get asked about,' Mr Godfrey said. This woman found a batch of spring onions growing in her rain gutter of the roof of her rental home . Whoops! This is what happens when one tenant went to take a relaxing bath and found her hot handle missing . This woman found her incense holder had been eaten by termites from inside a cabinet in her apartment . The survey found one of the biggest problems people were faced with is getting repairs or maintenance requests completed. 'Landlords and real estate agents are obligated to act quickly when it comes to repairs to ensure they're not putting tenants at risk,' Mr Godfrey said. 'It's their job to keep the property in a reasonable condition but if they're not taking care of it, you can take it to the tenancy tribunal. ‘Some tenants are afraid that they would get evicted if they raise their concerns. 'But don’t be nervous to ask for repairs and the best thing to do is always ask questions and negotiate with your landlord or real estate agent. ‘Push through those nerves because staying safe is your number one priority and there should be no reason why repairs should be delayed.' Why hello there attic! One tenant came home to find a hole in her bedroom . The rain was so heavy that it left permanent patches throughout this woman's rental home . This tenant used white duct tape to fix up the wood that started flaking off inside her home . This man said he couldn't wait to build his own home because he can only fit half his car undercover at this rental property . Another problem tenants were slapped with are unexplained rental increases. 'Tenants should be aware that rent has come down over the past few months so if you’re being slapped with rent increases, it’s definitely well worth looking into it,' Mr Godfrey said. Nguyet Tram, 21, from Sydney, told Daily Mail Australia that she started getting problems around her rental home just one week after moving in. ‘We moved into the home back in February and a week later, we noticed our ceiling in the dining and kitchen rooms were bubbling up and we could see water leaking through,’ she said. While this woman had to move her room outside because the air conditioner was broken . Nguyet Tram said her ceiling started bubbling up and the paint was peeling off from the water damage of the bathrooms up stairs in February and the landlord still hasn't repaired the damages . Ms Tram's shower was leaking from upstairs and has caused the ceiling to change colour and moulds have grown from the water damage but her landlord still hasn't done anything for eight months since it started . ‘We realised it was coming from both our showers up stairs so we called the landlord and he didn’t come around until two weeks later. ‘By the time he came around, the ceiling had turned yellow, the paint was crumbling and falling off and mould started growing out of it from the water damage. ‘They eventually fixed the showers but till today, we’re still living under the damage mouldy ceilings. ‘Another problem we have, which still hasn’t been resolved is the broken shower door in one of our bathrooms. We also didn’t have TV reception for six months. 'We've called, emailed, sent text messages but it never got anywhere so we ended up calling and paying for a cable guy ourselves.’ The frame on the shower door of Ms Tram's home still hasn't been repaired since May when she put in a request to her landlord and real estate agent . Ms Tram is not the only one who has faced with difficulty problems with her landlord and real estate. Jodie Rock from Newcastle, posted on CHOICE's Facebook page that the home she's currently renting has problems in every corner. 'It has live electrical cables hanging out of the walls, in-ground pool had barely any fencing, oven and grill don't work, big gas leak in cupboard because it's connected to the oven,' she wrote. 'There had been a fire in the laundry and lounge room due to ants nesting so badly in the light switches, toilet in en-suite leaking sewerage so they took it out and left the open sewer pipe and no toilet there (so it smells really really bad). 'They haven't paid the water bill so the water is always being disconnected and we have to put it back on ourselves. We've been electrocuted in the shower due to the earth being in a bad location. 'When it rains, it will rain in two of the rooms, only have a key to the front door, some door won't lock at all. When we tried to move in, we had to have a cleaner come in and it took them over a week to make inside liveable due to its filthy condition.' CHOICE reveals the top five tips to ensure consumers get the most out of their tenancy . 1. Rental increases . Your rent cannot be increased during a fixed-term tenancy agreement (less than two years), unless it is written into your contract. For a periodic lease, in most states and territories your rent can only be increased every six to 12 months. Plus, in most states and territories you’re entitled to a notice period of 60 days. Landlords are also not allowed to increase your rent by an excessive amount. While there is no set amount that is regarded as excessive, if you believe the rent increase is too large, you can dispute it through your state’s appropriate service. 2. Fee-free rent payments . Renters are often charged fees through third-party rent collection companies. In South Australia, New South Wales and Queensland, you’re entitled to at least one fee-free way to pay rent. 3. Right to repairs . Landlords are required to conduct repairs to keep the property in a reasonable condition. If your landlord does not take care of a repair or maintenance request, you may be able to apply to a tenancy tribunal to have your rent paid into a special account until the repairs are completed. 4. Right not to be on tenancy databases . You can only be put on the tenancy database for two reasons: if your rent is overdue by an amount larger than the bond, or if you’ve breached your tenancy agreement. Your agent or landlord is required to inform you if they plan on listing you, giving you time to consider and dispute the claims. 5. Right to get your bond back . Unless your landlord can make a legitimate complaint to the bond board, you have the right to get your bond back as soon as your tenancy is over.

"Seven years ago, he was an overweight smoker who feasted on chocolate and takeaways. But yesterday, Steve Way finished tenth in the Commonwealth Games marathon, breaking a 35-year-old  British record.

"A New Jersey dental assistant is filing a $5million lawsuit against the Gansevoort Hotel and a Belgian tourist after she was stabbed in the leg with a stiletto while partying at the ritzy hotel this past summer. Amanda Keisoglu was celebrating a cousin's bachelorette party with a group of 12 friends at the hotel's rooftop bar Plunge when intoxicated tourist Marie Thys of Belgium got into a fight with  someone near their bottle-service table. The 26-year-old told the New York Post that she didn't know Thys 'whatsoever' but that didn't stop the woman from bringing her into the fight. Amanda Keisoglu was celebrating a cousin's bachelorette party with a group of 12 friends at the hotel's rooftop bar Plunge when intoxicated tourist Marie Thys (pictured) of Belgium got into a fight with someone near their bottle-service table . Heel! Marie Thys of Belgium allegedly lodged her stiletto heel into Amanda Keisoglu’s thigh while drunk at the Gansevoort Hotel’s rooftop bar this past August . 'I felt my wrist get pulled, and it forced me to turn around,' Keisoglu said. 'Then she kicked my inner thigh.' And that stiletto stayed jammed into her left leg until someone pulled Thys off of her. That's when her leg started spurting blood and she had to plug up the wound with her own finger. Lawsuit: Keisoglu is now suing the Gansevoort hotel (pictured) and Thys for $5million . A friend helped her to the restroom and she was eventually taken to the hospital where she received intravenous antibiotics for her injury.

"Paul Revere, the organist and leader of the Raiders rock band, has died. He was 76. Manager Roger Hart says Revere died Saturday at his home in Idaho after battling cancer. No other details were provided. Revere, born Paul Revere Dick, became known as 'the madman of rock and roll' for his theatrical colonial wardrobe and infectious stage persona with the band. Paul Revere, the organist and leader of the Raiders rock band, has died at his Idaho home at the age of 76 . The group launched its career in 1963 with a popular rendition of Richard Berry's 'Louie, Louie' before releasing its own hits like 'Kicks,' 'Hungry' and 'Good Thing' Described as a teenage businessman with a recognizable name by the Los Angeles Times, he was known for wearing Revolutionary War-era costumes in live shows. The group launched its career in 1963 with a popular rendition of Richard Berry's 'Louie, Louie' before releasing its own hits like 'Kicks,' 'Hungry' and 'Good Thing.' The band's biggest hit arrived in 1971 with 'Indian Reservation.' A 1965 song, 'Just Like Me,'  was put on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's list of Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll. Revere and the Raiders served as the house band for the Dick Clark TV show 'Where the Action Is.' 'From day one, we've always been a party band that accidentally had some hit records and accidentally got on a hit television series,' Revere told the Associated Press in 2000. While he kept up a frantic tour schedule in recent years, health issues forced him back home about six months ago . 'We were visual and fun and crazy and were America's answer to the British music invasion,' he added. 'We just happened to be at the right time and had the right name and had the right gimmick.' The Raiders would also appear on Clark's show, 'Happening' as well as making guest appearances on 'The Ed Sullivan Show,' 'The Tonight Show,' and on the 'Batman' television show starring Adam West in 1966. 'After you've had some success, you're afraid it's gonna go away and you need to take advantage of it, so you work as hard as you can, because it might disappear tomorrow,' he said. Revere remained a constant presence with the group for almost five decades. While he kept up a frantic tour schedule in recent years, health issues forced him back home about six months ago. Survivors include his wife of 35 years, Sydney.

"Border guards in Mexico were given a bit of a shock when they opened a package to find ten baby crocodiles scampering around - even though the box was clearly marked 'Crocs'. The officials in the city of Jalpa de Mendez in Tabasco were suspicious that the box might contain counterfeit footwear, as the label said the contents were Crocs golfing shoes. But it turned out there were in fact genuine crocs inside, just not the type they were expecting. Border guards did not expect to find the reptilian creatures - despite opening a box marked Crocs . Border guard official Rode Tamez, 45, said: 'The baby crocodiles were badly dehydrated. We called in the environmental protection agency which took control of them.' A spokesman for the agency said: 'The crocodiles were being posted from here to a city over 500 miles away, clearly to be sold on the black market. 'It is doubtful that they would have survived. 'Unfortunately, this method of animal trafficking is becoming more commonplace. 'Because of the cramped conditions they are kept in, the stress they go through and the lack of food given to them, there is a very high mortality rate among animals smuggled this way.' The baby crocodiles were being trafficked by animal smugglers and were severely dehydrated when found . He added that crocodiles are considered an endangered species in Mexico and that if caught the traffickers could face up to nine years jail. The spokesman said: 'It's an ongoing battle between us and the smugglers, but this time we won and were able to save the lives of the crocodiles.' The baby crocs were taken to a local zoo where they are now being cared for.

"Missing: Lizi Hamer is thought to have been on a trek across the mountain range but friends say she has not made contact since the disaster . Fears are growing for the safety of six British trekkers after they were caught in a snow storm that has claimed the lives of at least 32 in the Himalayas, according to local reports. Hundreds of helpless tourists were buried as blizzards swept the Annapurna mountain range on Wednesday, setting off a series of devastating avalanches. A total of six Britons are unaccounted for, including Lizi Hamer, 31, and her wife, Lisa Walton, a former Olympic hockey player, have not contacted their families since the storm struck on Tuesday. Yesterday it emerged that the death toll could have been significantly higher but for the actions of British policeman Paul Sherridan, who led 150 fellow hikers to safety. Nepalese authorities said two or three Britons were unaccounted for among those still stranded on the slopes, according to local reports. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it was not aware of any missing persons. However, friends of advertising executive Lizi Hamer have made appeals for information on her whereabouts on the internet because she has not made contact since the disaster. The 31-year-old, who is thought to be based in Singapore, had previously expressed an interest in tackling the Annapurna Circuit – a long-distance high-altitude trek – but it is not yet known whether she made it to the base. The names of any other Britons caught up in the disaster are not known. Miss Hamer is believed to have travelled to the area with her partner Lisa Walton, a former New Zealand hockey player who she married in Australia last year. Lisa Dillon, a friend of Miss Hamer, told The Times: ‘They are both great athletes and we are sure they did not have enough time to get to the affected area, but just want to hear from them.’ Miss Hamer graduated in graphic art and design from Leeds Metropolitan University in 2006 before moving to Australia the following year, where she embarked on a career in advertising. She has previously worked for advertising giant Saatchi & Saatchi, and was named in a poll of the ‘top 20 women to watch in Asia’. The fitness enthusiast has also run the New York marathon and competed in an endurance event known as Ironman. Heartbreaking mission: Nepalese soldiers pull a body out of the snow after tragedy on mountain range . She posted a message on her Facebook page on Wednesday morning saying: ‘Let the trekking begin.’ And she last posted on Twitter at 3.15am on Wednesday but it is not yet known where she was when the message was sent. The Annapurna Circuit is regarded as an ‘entry-level’ route that is generally safe and can be tackled by inexperienced hikers. It attracts thousands of trekkers during its peak season in October when conditions are usually calm and conditions are safest. The freak storm this week developed when the tail end of a cyclone hit the region, causing temperatures to plunge. Teams scouring the slopes for survivors in helicopters rescued a group of 40 climbers at the highest point of the route yesterday. Around 270 trekkers have been rescued so far but many more are thought to be stranded in huts and lodges on the slopes where they sought sanctuary. A British survivor of the blizzard, who led 150 trekkers to safety, yesterday claimed that walkers on the mountain had been ‘herded to their deaths’ by guides. Police officer Paul Sherridan said the disaster could have been prevented, and blamed guides for ignoring the weather forecast and failing to carry safety equipment in order to ‘lighten their load’. The 49-year-old took the initiative when he saw disorientated mountaineers starting to freeze to death. He battled through the storm for two hours to a less hostile position, believing that a group of ten hikers was following. But the experienced hill-walker was stunned when he turned around to see 150 behind him. He had joined around 100 trekkers on a three-week trip around the 150-mile Annapurna Circuit. On the morning of the disaster, the group was attempting to navigate the Thorung La pass, the highest section of the route. Mr Sherridan, from Doncaster, described ‘gasping for air’ as the group was overcome with fear because of the black-out conditions. Emerging from one of Nepal's worst mountaineering disasters, he said: ""I saw a Nepalese boy and his face was frozen. There was sheer glass ice hanging on his cheek. I went across to him and I said 'Your face is frozen' and he said 'I know' and he began to cry and we both began to cry. ""I didn't know whether or not he was going to survive. The injuries to his face were horrific. ""As I descended this abyss of nothing, I realised that the people I was following didn't know where they were. It was at that point that I realised I had gone from a place of safety into an absolute position of fear and sheer terror."" ‘It was at that point that I realised I had gone from a place of safety into an absolute position of fear and sheer terror. Fortunately there was a brief respite and I saw a pole.’ He told the small group to follow the markers, making sure to keep track of the person on either side of them. ‘As we went further down, I realised it wasn’t just ten people, it was probably 150 people. I just stopped and I looked and I cried.’","Friends of Briton Lizi Hamer say she was on trek but has not been in touch .

"Five year-old Amelia Abbott can’t stop dancing and with very good reason – she has just been declared cancer free and finally returned home after three and a half months in hospital battling leukemia. Amelia's mum Michelle told Daily Mail Australia that there were no words to express how she was feeling. 'It has been a magical journey and the strength and joy I have enabled to embrace with my children has been priceless.'

Lachy had 280ml of barrow marrow removed, which was transplanted into Amelia just a few hours later on July 9. Amazingly, his young body has replaced this marrow within a few weeks. ‘He woke and all he wanted to do was see Amelia, but she was in isolation so he waved at her through the window,’ she said. Only 17 months apart in age, Amelia (left) and Lachy (right) have always had a close relationship . Amelia dreams of one day growing up to be a ‘princess ballerina’ When the pair reunited five weeks later, Michelle was glad to have her camera on hand to capture the heart-warming moment. The huge grin on Amelia’s face spoke a million words when she held her little brother. ‘He ran into the room and they just embraced,’ she said. ‘They don’t go well when they don’t see each other for a while.’ Only 17 months apart in age, Amelia and Lachy have always had a close relationship which has significantly strengthened since the beginning of this special journey. Lachy had 280ml of barrow marrow removed, which was transplanted into Amelia just a few hours later on July 9. Amazingly, his young body has replaced this marrow within a few weeks. Michelle says her son and daughter have a bond as strong as twins . ‘She has always been like his little mother since he was born and he’s her strength – they are more like twins,’ she said. ‘And now they have a bond that will never be broken – it has been magical to watch it grow.’ When Michelle and her husband, Chris, had to tell Amelia who was only four at the time, that she was sick, they decided to break it down in a way she would easily understand. ‘I told her that the chemo was Pacman, who had to eat the nasties inside her,’ she said. There are currently about 175,000 bone marrow donors registered and the majority are categorised as North West European Caucasian. Australian Bone Marrow Donor Registry operations manager Garth Healey said there is a desperate need for more ethnic diversity from people who register - with 70 per cent of possible donors fitting this genetic mould across the world. ‘We don’t have many Indonesian, Malaysian or Sri Lankan donors because they don’t have registries in their countries,’ he said. ‘We would also love to get more Indigenous Australians.’ Of the people known to have needed a bone marrow transplant about 30 per cent do not find a donor from either their family or from an unrelated donor. The registry only takes unrelated donors aged between 18 and 45-years-old and they are taken off the registry once the person turns 60. ‘Evidence shows the younger the donor - the better the outcome for patients,’ Mr Healey said. ‘We are always looking for people in their 20s.’ Since 2003, the amount of Australian patients searching the registry for an unrelated bone marrow donor has risen from 310 to 660. ‘This is mainly due to there being more unrelated transplant hospitals in Australia since 2003 and the increase of people needing a transplant,’ Mr Healey said. For more information on donations phone: Australian Bone Marrow Donor Registry on freecall 13 14 95 or visit www.abmdr.org.au . Amelia has a very sound understanding of the incredible gift she has been given by her brother Lachy . The inseparable pair have a special bond that will never be broken . Amelia (left) and Lachy (right) can't bare spending long periods of time apart from one another . But when the chemotherapy wasn't successful, they had another chat with their daughter about her brother helping out. Her instant response proved her extraordinary understanding of a complex situation for a child who had not yet turned five. ‘Pacman is not doing a good enough job so Lachy’s super cells are going in to help. But Pacman is still on guard to help kill them off if they come back,’ Amelia told her parents. 'She’s an intelligent young girl,’ her mother said. ‘She’s my strength and always has positivity.’ ‘She says “I’ll get those nasties” – it’s been an amazing journey.’ Six weeks after her transplant, Amelia was given the all clear for the first time. She had her 100-day test on Thursday and expects to receive the results early next week. Amelia’s family and friends participated in the Leukaemia Foundation of Queensland’s Light the Night 2014 at Broadwater Parklands, Marine Pde in Southland, Queensland on Wednesday.

"Health officials are searching cancer records after revelations of 16 people who lived within a kilometre of a Melbourne factory died from asbestos-related diseases. The Herald Sun reports five acres of land at the Wunderlich asbestos factory in Sunshine North were covered in asbestos dust for 20 years from the mid-1950s. Research has so far identified 25 people who lived near the factory who later died or became ill with asbestos-related illnesses. Health officials are searching cancer records after 16 people who lived near a Melbourne factory died from asbestos-related diseases . Health Minister David Davis said the news was 'very troubling' and the health department was investigating. 'They obviously have access to some of the cancer registries, which may be helpful in understanding what has gone on in that area,' Mr Davis told reporters on Sunday. But he stopped short of telling Victorians who grew up in the area to get health checks, saying he was waiting for the health department's data. 'If there's advice to be given to the community, we'll certainly do that,' he said. Five acres of land at the Wunderlich asbestos factory in Sunshine North were covered in asbestos dust for 20 years from the mid-1950s . Wunderlich was sold to CSR in 1969 and the company has paid compensation to some victims . Slater and Gordon lawyer Margaret Kent said the law firm had represented many Wunderlich victims in their fight for compensation. 'These people did not work at the Wunderlich factory, yet they became ill because companies failed to carry out their environmental obligations,' Ms Kent said on Sunday. 'Mothers were exposed as they walked their children to and from school, children became ill as they rode their bikes past the factory or played in the mounds of asbestos behind the site.' Wunderlich was sold to CSR in 1969 and the company has paid compensation to some victims. CSR sold the factory to James Hardie in 1977, before it stopped operating in the 1980s.","Health officials are searching cancer records after  16 people who lived near a Melbourne factory died from asbestos-related diseases .

"The race that stops the nation costs the economy more than $1 billion in lost productivity, figures show. Research by HR firm Randstad found that 77 percent of working Australians spend three and a half hours or more celebrating the Melbourne Cup. The survey found that 15 percent watch the race and participate in office sweepstakes before getting back to work, and just 8 percent are too busy to watch the race at all. Scroll down for video . Melbourne was in a Cup frenzy on Monday for the parade before the race that stops the nation - and costs about $1 billion in lost productivity . Race fans - and trainer Gai  Waterhouse (right) - enjoy the spectacle of the Melbourne Cup . A conservative found the Melbourne Cup costs employers  $1.2 billion in lost productivity. Pictured are revellers at the end of Derby Day at Flemington Racecourse in Melbourne on Saturday . Crowds build up during race 6 at the Melbourne Cup at Flemington Racecourse in Melbourne in 2013 . The survey, taken in 2010 but adjusted to account for the Australian Bureau of Statistics' current size of the workforce and average hourly wage, found that a conservative estimate of the Melbourne Cups' cost to productivity  is $1.2 billion. Taking into account costs associated with employees taking Monday off, particularly in Victoria where Melbourne Cup Tuesday is a public holiday, and the loss of productivity over much of  Wednesday, the number would be much higher, Randstad's Mike Roddy said. Paul Dundon, managing director of workplace absence management firm Direct Health Solutions, said figures show the number of full-time employees who call in sick on the Wednesday following Melbourne Cup day jumps by 25 percent. With just over 8 million full-time workers in Australia, for employers that means an extra 80,000 people don't go to work at a cost of $24 million, Mr Dundon said. Randstad found 77 percent of working Australians spend three and a half hours or more celebrating the  Cup . This is based on the absenteeism rate jumping from the daily average of 4 percent to 5 percent, and the cost of a sick day costing employers $300. Mr Roddy said the majority of Australian workers expect to engage in Melbourne Cup festivities at work. 'From lunchtime onwards tomorrow you only have to look in any foyer of any workplace and fascinators will be filling the room with people going to lunches or getting on the bus to go to the races,' Mr Roddy said. 'There are various lunches and functions in the office and it's almost like a graveyard shift between two and five o'clock.' But Mr Roddy said bosses should take advantage of the benefits of organising a Melbourne Cup event, as it could motivate employees to work longer or harder later down the track. Father and son jockey Glyn (right) and Chad Schofield at the parade before the Tuesday's big race . Race fans young and old get into the Cup spirit during the official parade on Monday . Almost 14 million Australians will spend $400 million betting on the Melbourne Cup tomorrow . 'If you weren't to allow people to celebrate you could be perceived as draconian,' he said. 'It's an opportunity to use this as a tool for having bit of fun and connecting with your people.' The race also puts a drain on Australians' purse strings thanks to increase in people gambling, buying new outfits for Melbourne Cup functions and the jump in spending at pubs, clubs and restaurants around the country. But this spike in spending injects millions into the retail, hospitality and tourism sectors of the economy, particularly in Victoria. Almost 14 million Australians will spend $400 million betting on the Melbourne Cup tomorrow, or an average of $29 each, according to insurance firm Asteron Life. Last year the Melbourne Cup Carnival injected $177.5 million into Victoria's gross state product . Last year IBISWorld estimated that Melbourne Cup boosts spending on food and alcohol by $167.9 million thanks to the number of events at workplaces, bars, clubs, restaurants and private homes. And a study undertaken on behalf of Victoria Racing Club found that last year the Melbourne Cup Carnival injected $177.5 million into Victoria's gross state product. More than 48,000 visitors travelled to Victoria specifically for Melbourne Cup, spending $25.6 million on accommodation. Retail spending for the Cup hit $53.1 million in Victoria alone, with race enthusiasts buying more than 62,000 hats and fascinators, 60,000 pairs of shoes, 50,000 dresses, 30,000 items of jewellery, 27,000 ties, 21,000 handbags, 18,000 suits, 17,000 items of underwear, 14,000 shirts, 11,000 pairs of sunglasses and 13,000 pairs of socks and pantihose.

"A set of more than 250 World War Two posters found folded up in a chest of drawers are set to sell for £20,000. The immaculate posters were packed away at the end of war in 1945 and were only discovered when the seller, from London, cleared out his garage. He found about 100 different designs - some of which were duplicates. A collection of posters from World War II, including these released by the Ministry of Information, have been found in a London garage and will now be put up for auction . The collection, discovered by the seller when he was clearing out his garage, also includes the original and now world famous Keep Calm and Karry On design, as well as this famous 'Together' poster . Another one of the posters features this dramatic scene of a Navy boat speeding away from an enemy ship engulfed in flames with the caption 'Britain's Sea Power is Yours' Another version of the same poster shows scores of warships sailing across the seas . The collection includes posters advising those on the home front what do if you are caught in air raids while at home or on the streets. Other posters carry patriotic messages urging the support of Allied troops while others warn of the danger of giving away secrets by talking about the war in public. Among the posters is a rare original of the now world-famous Keep Calm and Carry On design - which was distributed in limited numbers in 1939 but never displayed in public.

"Amanda Bynes's parents have visited the troubled star at the California hospital where she is being held against her will. Rick Bynes and Lynn Organ were pictured arriving at Las Encinas Hospital in Pasadena, where their daughter was taken after flying into LAX yesterday, where she made rambling claims to photographers and seemed unwell. She was driven to hospital and reportedly taken under a psychiatric hold after being tricked into flying to California by Sam Lutfi, the controversial manager who was blamed for Britney Spears's public 2008 breakdown. Scroll down for video . Concerned: Rick Bynes and Lynn Organ were pictured arriving at Lad Encinas Hospital in Pasadena, California, yesterday . Troubled: A representative of the hospital helps guide them inside to see their daughter - who recently launched an online tirade against her father accusing him of molesting her - which she swiftly retracted . Amanda Bynes 'was in touch with Britney Spears' controversial ex-manager Sam Lutfi' ...hours before she was placed under 5150 psychiatric hold on Friday . Afterwards: Rick Rynes was pictured again today as his Los Angeles home after visiting Amanda . It followed a troubling outburst by the star, 28, who accused her own father of sexually abusing her as a child - before retracting the tirade and saying a microchip in her head made her say it. Amanda's mom issued a statement in the aftermath, refuting the claims and saying she was 'heartbroken'. But Amanda seemed not to have made peace with her family after she had landed, telling paparazzi she had 'taken out a restraining order' against her dad. Moments later she was taken to the hospital, where, according to TMZ, she was held under section 51510 of the California Welfare and Institutions Code. The law lets mentally ill people who are classified as a danger to themselves or others be taken in against their will. Locked away: Amanda Bynes is reportedly being kept in Las Encinas Hospital, Pasadena, California . Worrying: Amanda Bynes tweets Sam Lutfi hours before she is hospitalized . Responding: Sam Lutfi appeared to confirm his involvement with Amanda Bynes, tweeting Perez Hilton saying she is 'in good hands now' History repeating itself? Britney Spears seen in 2007 with her controversial ex manager Sam Lutfi, shortly before she suffered a public breakdown . Her detention is another twist in the star's very public downward spiral, which had previously culminated in claims she was getting married - which were promptly swatted away by her would-be groom. On Wednesday Amanda tweeted the supposed news of her engagement - saying her wedding was going to go on the front of a major magazine. Troubled: Britney Spears in 2007 when she was managed by Sam Lutfi . But Caleb Pusey, her supposed betrothed, said the pair weren't even dating - and that he hadn't even spoken to her in months. Friends of Caleb, 19, told TMZ that the engagement was a figment of Amanda's imagination. She repeated the claims after landing at LAX - though she refused to name the man in question when asked. The journey was reportedly a scheme masterminded by Sam Lutfi, whom Britney Spears's family blame for her 2008 breakdown during which she shaved off all her hair. Sources claim that Amanda - who tweeted her affection for Lutfi hours before taking off - had convinced her to sue her parents, and told her to come to LA to meet with attorneys. On arrival she told photographers that she was going to meet with 'sick lawyers'. But a report in TMZ said that when she stepped out of her car she was surrounded by hospital staff instead. Lutfi recently tweeted a response to celebrity blogger Perez Hilton, who has asked after Amanda. He said: 'She's in good hands now. Many thanks to all those that helped along the way.' And now Perez claims Bynes has told them: 'Last time I trusted Lutfi he put me in a conservatorship which ended in August I'm not stupid. 'You are all listening to my brain…I can handle Sam, he just flew me back to LA and I'm going to meet some sick lawyers.' Lutfi has strenuously denied any claims that he was responsible for Britney's meltdown. On his Twitter bio, he says he was 'FALSELY accused of doing horrible things by horrible people.' Britney's mother Lynne Spears blamed Lutfi for his involvement in her daughter's breakdown, when he managed her in 2007 and 2008. Amanda is expected to be held at the hospital for 72 hours, but the hold can be extended for a further 14 days. It is expected that her parents will try to get another conservatorship. Help at hand: Amanda Bynes is seen at LAX, shortly before heading to a hospital is Pasadena . Oops: The troubled star appeared to drop her phone as she walked through the terminal . The news comes after a source had told MailOnline that at 6am Friday morning Amanda, tried unsuccessfully to buy a ticket out of Manhattan. According to the airport insider the actress then left the airport in a taxi hoping to be able to catch a flight out of JFK. When contacted by the MailOnline the Port Authority confirmed Amanda had been at the airport but a spokesman said 'there were no summons and no arrests' made over the incident. The star was pictured by a fan inside the terminal buying food and was carrying multiple bags. It was claimed the Easy A actress tried 'to force a ticket agent into re-routing a plane'. Stopping traffic: Amanda pauses while crossing the road and she continues to talk on her phone . Ttroubled Amanda Bynes landed safely back in LAX on Friday, clearly having found a way out of her predicament of not being able to get a flight . Around lunchtime in New York, Amanda posted a serious of disturbing tweets accusing her father of sexually abusing her. Explaining why she did not want to live with her father and mother in California - where she was released from an inpatient psychiatric facility in December - the actress said on Twitter she could not be in the same house as her father. The embattled star wrote: 'My dad was verbally and physically abuse to me as a child. 'He called me ugly as a child and then asked me if I wanted to have sex with him and I did not know how to respond and I said no and then... I was forced to live with my dad which was a total nightmare.' Whereabouts unknown:The 28-year-old wore the same clothing as she did when she flew into the city last week, pictured, and was last seen headed to JFK airport . A few minutes later her tweets took an even more disturbing turn. She wrote to her more than 3million followers: 'My dad fondled himself in front of me so many times that I started recording him on my phone in hopes of catching him... saying or doing something inappropriate around me so I could get him arrested & put in jail for the rest of his perverted life.' Two hours later, Amanda recanted. Taking the abusive comments back she said: 'My dad never did any of those things. The microchip in my brain made me say those things but he's the one that ordered them to microchip me.' Her mother Lynn issuing a statement to Hollyscoop saying she was 'heartbroken' by what her daughter had said. Accusations: The actress had alleged her father, Rick, was abusive to her as a child but then recanted . 'Total nightmare': Explaining why she did not want to live with her father and mother Lynn in California, the actress said on Twitter she could not be in the same house as her father . Disturbing turn: The 28-year-old went on to describe what she says her father did to her . She said in a statement: 'I am heartbroken today for my husband of 47 years. Rick has been the best father and husband a family can ask for. 'He has never abused Amanda or our other children [Tommy and Julian] physically or sexually. These accusations are absolutely horrible and could not be further from the truth!' Lynn said her daughter's mental illness is to blame for the claims. 'These allegations stem from Amanda's mental state at the moment. They have no basis in reality. It saddens me beyond belief that my husband's character could be slandered in such a way.' Devastated: Mother Lynn, pictured 2004, said the family was 'heartbroken' that their daughter could accuse Rick (left) of doing such awful things . Their lawyer, Tamar Arminak, also told MailOnline: 'My clients are heartbroken by these false accusations. Their older children [Jillian and Tommy] are also horrified at the situation.' Arminak also spoke to TMZ on the siblings' behalf, who defender their father. On Friday, video of the star also emerged showing her dancing around and behaving unusually at boutique Pookie & Sebastian emerged.

"One of the world's largest hotel chains has today launched an innovative new device that lets guests unlock their hotel rooms with their smartphones. Starwood Hotels and Resorts, which owns and runs 1,162 hotels worldwide, unveiled the feature at 10 Aloft, Element and W hotels. It is planning to expand the technology, which works via a Bluetooth connection, to 140 more of its properties by the middle of next year. Starwood Hotels and Resorts, which owns and runs 1,162 hotels worldwide, have unveiled an innovative smartphone feature that unlocks hotels doors using Bluetooth technology . The facility is set to revolutionise the check-in process as it means that busy travellers can now by-pass the concierge desk altogether and head straight to their rooms. As well as meaning an end to check-in queues, the new facility could eventually mean the end for key cards and traditional room keys. Hilton Worldwide is the only other hotel chain to publicly acknowledge plans for mobile room keys - which it plans to roll out at the end of 2015 at its US properties including Hilton, Waldorf Astoria, Conrad and Canopy hotels. The move comes after Marriott International launched the ability for guests to check in through a smartphone app at 330 of its North American hotels last year. The facility is set to revolutionise the check-in process as it means that busy travellers can now by-pass the concierge desk altogether and head straight to their rooms . Mobile check-in is already being offered to travellers at the main check-in counter at the Marriott Marquis Times Square hotel in New York . A guest at the Marriott Marquis Times Square hotel in New York after using the mobile check-in facility . By the end of this year, the programme will be live at all 4,000 Marriott hotels worldwide. When a room becomes available, a message is sent to the guest's phone. Traditional room keys are pre-programmed and waiting at the front desk. A special express line allows guests to bypass crowds, flash their IDs and get keys. InterContinental Hotels Group is testing express check-in at 60 hotels. ‘Guests want this because it makes their lives simpler,’ said Mark Vondrasek, who oversees the loyalty program and digital initiatives for Starwood. ‘The ability to go right to your room, gives them back time.’ The innovations are still being tweaked as hotels scramble to catch up to airlines. Fliers today can already use their phones to check in, select seats and as a boarding pass. Hotels envision a similar relationship, with guests ultimately ordering poolside drinks via an app. Marriott International launched the ability to check in through its app at 330 North American hotels last year . Guests who like personal interaction can still opt for a more leisurely check-in, and the hotel companies insist the move isn't about cutting jobs. Brett Cowell, vice president of information technology for Hyatt, which is testing permanent keys for frequent guests at six hotels, explained the decision to introduce the new streamlined check-in process, saying: ‘If you're at the end of a long day, you might want a little less of a chatty experience. ‘But if you're showing up at a new resort, you may want to know what the pool hours are.’ Starwood’s new smartphone facilities require the phone to actually touch a pad on the outside of the door to open it, which the company say prevents guests accidentally unlocking their doors if their smartphones are in their pocket. By the end of this year, the program will be live at all 4,000 Marriott hotels worldwide . Also, an additional security measure means that only one phone can be linked to a room at a time. If two people are staying in the room, they still need to get a traditional key for the second guest. Hotels are currently trying to get more travellers comfortable using their mobile apps to purchase suites, spa treatments and room service though their phones and tablets. It is also hoped that smartwatches will soon be able to perform the same functions, while guests can also use apps on their iPads that are capable of requesting a wake-up call from staff. Marriott guests made $1.25bn in bookings last year through its mobile app, according to George Corbin, senior vice president of digital for the company. Guests who like personal interaction can still opt for a more leisurely check-in, and the hotel companies insist the move isn't about cutting jobs . The new facilities could eventually mean an end to check-in queues, key cards and traditional room keys . Starwood's app to unlock hotel rooms currently requires Bluetooth data connection. Each hotel room needs to have a new lock that can communicate with phones. The top 15 hotel companies have more than 42,000 properties worldwide with a combined 5.2 million rooms, according to travel research firms STR and STR Global. Many hotels have made updates over the past few years, but they remain the minority. Marriott says it is holding off on smartphone keys until all the potential bugs can be resolved. ‘If there was ever a moment that matters,’ Corbin says, ‘it's the moment when you go up to your door and the key doesn't work.’ But for the frequent business traveller, this might just be the time-saver they are looking for. Bruce Craven spends about 100 nights a year on the road, traveling between his California home and New York where he does executive training programs and teaches at Columbia Business School. He's been testing Starwood's smartphone room key since March. ‘If you're traveling all the time, little things can take on a symbolic importance,’ Craven said. ‘This is one less thing that I need to think about.’","Starwood Hotels and Resorts is the first chain to uses the facility .

At the time, Mr Valdez told the court: 'It would have required her to have to swing her arm to strike the child on the head but she could never move her arm in that manner.' Mayra then testified that she witnessed her sister Jaime using a brush to hit her son Eliseo repeatedly on his arms, legs and head. 'I thought I was dying anyway so I decided to admit that I'd done it to protect my sister because I love her,' she told the court.

"This poor little pooch proves she is up for the battle as she practices to walk using splints. Nine-week old Tuffty, who is a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel cross Toy Poodle, or Cavapoo for short, was born with problems that affected her back legs. Because her limbs folded inwards when she walked which meant she dragged her feet, she has been wearing splints on her legs and already, as this video shows, she is coming on leaps and bounds. Tuffty is coming to terms with her problems with her back legs, but remains a confident puppy . She can run around with the best of them as she's adapting to life wearing the splints. Tuffty needs a home with someone who has patience to help her build her strength in her legs. She has trouble getting up and down steps. The cute dog's tail never stops wagging as you can see. As well as meeting her walking challenges head on, she is developing well with her in-house training at such a young age. The nine-week old puppy was born with her back legs folding inwards . Despite her struggles, Tuffty has been described as 'just the happiest puppy' by the rescue centre . A home with someone who can be around regularly during the day would be ideal for Tuffty . The good news is, if your heart has melted after watching the video, that Tuffty is on the lookout for a new home. Caroline Trigg, who runs Ravenswood Pet Rescue, told Mail Online: 'She has got feeling in her legs, but she just doesn't have the strength in her muscles at the moment. 'Hopefully as she gets older she will develop these and become much stronger. 'She is just the happiest puppy; she isn't in any discomfort at all, and it's great to see her walking. It is hoped that as she gets older, the muscles in her back legs can develop and grow stronger . 'She loves children, she loves other smaller dogs, so these would be things we would like to consider when finding her a new home.

"This is the moment a woman slaps an aide of sleazy pick-up 'expert' Julien Blanc as tempers flare over the controversial American's seminars. The incident which happened after one of Blanc's talks had to be cancelled when an angry mob gathered outside a venue in Melbourne occurred just hours before Blanc was kicked out of Australia for his 'abhorrent views'. The footage, uploaded to YouTube, shows an angry woman berate Blanc's assistant - known only as RSD Max - as the crowd chanted 'sexual assault is not OK'.

"An Alabama judge has dismissed a second lawsuit filed by a man who says his penis was amputated during a circumcision gone awry. Circuit Judge Jim Hughey in Birmingham issued an order Wednesday throwing out the lawsuit filed by Johnny Lee Banks Jr, 56, and his wife against Princeton Baptist Medical Center and doctors he claims injured him. It is the second lawsuit Banks has filed in the incident. Judge Hughey tossed Banks' original lawsuit in August. Hughey ruled it was not specific enough under Alabama's malpractice law. Hughey's ruling on the second lawsuit cites similar reasons. But he left the door open for a third lawsuit. Banks, a wheelchair-bound double amputee and a diabetic, says he awoke from what should have been a routine circumcision to realize that his sex organ had been chopped down to about an inch. The hospital and doctors have denied any wrongdoing. Court documents show Banks has numerous health problems. Michael Florie, an attorney representing the doctors named in Banks' now-defunct lawsuit, has dismissed the allegations as 'completely false.' In August, Florie said Banks had a history of 'diabetic wet gangrene,' which led to dead tissue accumulation in the patient's lower extremities, according to AL.com. At the time of the first lawsuit's dismissal two months ago, Banks' attorney said the physical evidence in the case should be sufficient. The 'proof is in the pudding,' he told AL.com. Banks' wife Zelda, 55, also sued for loss of consortium due to the bungled operation. In the amended lawsuit filed in September, Banks' attorney, John Graves, changed the date of the procedure from June to February 2014, and also named Dr Meil Duggan Jr as the surgeon who 'may have performed the circumcision,' the local TV station Alabama's 13 reported. According to the patient and his attorney, the penis amputation was performed without consent or explanation of the operation's medical necessity. In response, the lawyer representing the doctors in the case accused his counterpart of ignoring the medical records. 'In the complaint filed last month, this patient claimed that he awoke to find his penis missing in June,' Michael Florie said in September. 'Now he alleges that he awoke to find it missing in February.'","Johnny Lee Banks Jr., 56, claims he went in for the routine procedure but woke up without his privates .

"The North Pole may conjure up images of impressive ice sheets and freezing winds, but scenes from a webcam there reveal a different story. Two weeks of warm weather in the high Arctic have caused an aquamarine lake to begin forming since July 13, according to the North Pole Environmental Observatory’s camera. The National Snow and Ice Data Centre has reported that temperatures in early July were one to three degrees Celsius higher than the year’s average over most of the Arctic Ocean. Scroll down for video . Two weeks of warm weather in the high Arctic earlier have caused an aquamarine lake to begin forming at the North Pole . July is known as the melting month for the Arctic with the period seeing ice shrink at its fastest rate. The ice is expected to be further fractured by an Arctic cyclone, which is currently developing over the area. According to CBC, the weather system will strengthen winds to anywhere from 75-100 km/h. Last August, a similar system developed in the area which destroyed 800,000 square km of ice. However, the Arctic hit record low ice melt last year on September 16, 2012, the smallest recorded since satellites began tracking the Arctic ice in the 1970s. The National Snow and Ice Data Center reported that temperatures in early July were one to three degrees Celsius higher than the year's average over most of the Arctic Ocean . But experts are divided over what the recent data will mean for the future sea-levels. ‘I have seen much more extensive ponding,’ James Morison, the principal investigator for the North Pole Environmental Observatory told The Atlantic. ‘Because we use wide angle lenses the melt pond looks much bigger than it is.’ Morison also pointed out that a camera 100 meters away showed the ice looking relatively intact. He added that the scale of these images is also quite small. Last week a team of researchers led by Dr Bert Wouters at the University of Bristol claimed that long-term data on the melting of Earth’s polar is too weak to suggest alarming decrease is permanent or caused by humans. The images above show sea ice coverage in 1980 and 2012, as observed by passive microwave sensors on NASA's Nimbus-7 satellite and by the Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder. Multi-year ice is shown in bright white, while average sea ice cover is shown in light blue to milky white . The group compared nine years of satellite measurements of glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica in an attempt to determine if the melt-off is part of an accelerating trend in ice loss and sea-level rise. While the study showed a loss of about 300 billion tonnes of ice per year from the Arctic and Antarctic regions, it noted that natural processes cannot be ruled out as the force behind the receding ice sheets. Last week a team of researchers led by Dr Bert Wouters at the University of Bristol claimed that long-term data on the melting of Earth's polar is too weak to suggest alarming decrease is permanent or caused by humans . We could refreeze the Arctic, and it wouldn't even cost that much, a scientist claims. Two published studies explore the possibility that a technological solution could be found to the problem of global warming melting the ice caps on the North Pole. The scientist who is lead author on both claims that 'any significant nation' could find the resources to carry out the operation. The only significant question, he says, is whether we should. David Keith, professor of applied physics at Harvard University, is lead author on papers published in Nature Climate Change and Environmental Research Letters which speculate as to how we could restore the polar ice. He used climate models to suggest injecting reflective particles into the atmosphere could reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth, engineering a regional effect that could bring ice back to the Arctic. His paper claims that by reducing the penetration of sunlight by just 0.5 per cent is could be possible to restore the sea-ice around the North Pole back to pre-industrial era levels. His second paper suggests the whole operation could be accomplished with just a few modified Gulfstream jets, costing somewhere in the region of $8billion a year. However, while he believes action must be taken to tackle the amount of pollution spewed into the Earth's atmosphere, he doesn't yet advocate the kind of action his papers suggest.","North Pole Environmental Observatory images show lake forming in Arctic .

"A Wyoming teen was charged as an adult for first-degree murder after he opened fire on a group of teens killing one and injuring another. Tyler Burns, 19, suffered a gunshot wound to his stomach and begged for his life before 16-year-old Phillip Sam shot him in the head Oct. 5, in a public execution practically unheard of in the city of Cheyenne. Burns died at a hospital one day after the shooting where Sam opened fire on 13 teens. The teens began to scatter until just Burns, Sam and a minor who was with Sam were left alone.

Court records state that the minor who was with Sam told police that Burns begged Sam for for his life. But Sam walked up to Burns 'until he was at point-blank range' and shot him again twice. The Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports that Sam had agreed to meet at the park to fight one of the teens but instead immediately began shooting when he arrived at the scene. Sam told police that he got a .40-calibur handgun from his mother's boyfriend and brought it to the park. Begged: Burns begged Sam for for his life after Sam shot him in the stomach, but Sam walked up to Burns 'until he was at point-blank range' and shot him again twice .

In a preliminary hearing at Laramie County Circuit Court, Detective James Harper from Cheyenne Police Department stated that Sam said he brought the gun to the park because 'he didn't want to get jumped.' Sam was also charged with 10 additional counts, according to the WTE, and is being held at a juvenile detention center on $250,000 bail. Sam was charged as an adult, however, because he is a minor, the maximum penalty Sam could receive would be life in prison, the WTE reports. Each aggravated assault count Sam receives carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.

"Quitting smoking is a goal that many fail to achieve. But a study has found that long time smokers were more successful in kicking the habit when taking psilocybin - the active hallucinogenic agent in ‘magic mushrooms'. The controlled experiment found that 80 per cent of participants successfully quit after six months. A study by John Hopkins University in Baltimore gave 15 people psilocybin, the active hallucinogenic agent in 'magic mushrooms' (stock image shown). The participants had all been active smokers for an average of 31 years. After three doses over eight weeks, 12 of the 15 were able to quit . The research was carried out by the John Hopkins University in Baltimore . In the study ten men and five women, all mentally and physically healthy, took part. Each had smoked an average of 19 cigarettes a day for 31 years but had repeatedly tried to quit, without success. Each participant was given a dose of psilocybin in pill form on a day they planned to quit smoking. Under the influence of psilocybin, activity in the more primitive brain network linked to emotional thinking became more pronounced. Several different areas in this network - such as the hippocampus and anterior cingulate cortex - appear to be active at the same time. This pattern of activity is similar to the pattern observed in people who are dreaming. It also made activity in the brain area linked to high-level thinking, including self-consciousness, more uncoordinated. Two and eight weeks later they were then given higher doses of the drug. Each drug-taking session lasted six to seven hours, during which they were kept in a safe and comfortable setting. They often wore eyeshades and listened to music while being told to relax. In addition they undertook weekly counselling and kept a diary to monitor their cravings. By the end of the study 12 of the 15 participants were able to quit smoking completely. The researchers add that the experiment is not an endorsement for taking magic mushrooms, but rather highlights how psilocybin can be useful in controlled environments. ‘Quitting smoking isn’t a simple biological reaction to psilocybin, as with other medications that directly affect nicotine receptors,’ said Dr Matthew Johnson, one of the authors on the study. ‘When administered after careful preparation and in a therapeutic context, psilocybin can lead to deep reflection about one’s life and spark motivation to change.’ The researchers say other methods of quitting smoking (stock image shown) have much lower success rates. Approximately 35 per cent experience six-month success rates when taking the smoking cessation drug varenicline, while other treatments like nicotine patches have success rates of less than 30 per cent .","Study by John Hopkins University in Baltimore gave 15 people psilocybin, the active hallucinogenic agent in 'magic mushrooms'

"West Ham are now capable of mixing up their style of play to beat the Premier League's best sides, according to boss Sam Allardyce. The high-flying Hammers recovered from going a goal down to Swansea last weekend to win 3-1, with Andy Carroll scoring twice and setting up Diafra Sakho late on. That victory - West Ham's eighth of the season - temporarily moved the east London outfit up to third in the league, although it was the nature of the performance which really pleased Allardyce. West Ham striker Andy Carroll rises highest to head home his side's winning goal against Swansea on Sunday . Hammers boss Sam Allardyce was delighted with his side's 'most complete performance of the season' Carroll leaps into the air to celebrate scoring his second goal of the game against Garry Monk's side . Writing in his column for the Evening Standard, the former Bolton manager said: 'It was very satisfying to be able to break down a team which defended in numbers for most of the game because we've invariably struggled to overcome that since we've been back in the Premier League. 'In the past, teams have sat back and we've not been able to find a way through. Now we can mix it up and break down teams who want to play that way. That's great for a manager.' While their goals against Garry Monk's side arrived with the help of Carroll's head, the Hammers have also earned plaudits for their flowing football this season. And Allardyce, who is preparing his side to face Sunderland on Saturday, admits he has no problem with rewarding his players with a Christmas Party, providing they don't cause any trouble.

Discussing her mother Fiona’s death for the first time, Miss Allsopp, 42, said: ‘When my sister went to get the Christmas decorations she found it – which was a bit of a shock. 'There was always a lot of very dark humour in our house. When Mum was alive her grave was dug so it was all ready. She wanted to be near Benji, our old pony’s grave. ‘She managed not to die on anybody’s birthday. She managed not to die when anyone was out of the country. 'It’s like she died when everyone had time to deal with it. We buried her in the garden the next day. ‘We lifted her into the wicker coffin and we put her on the trailer on the back of the tractor and drove her up the garden. 'It was very important for her that it was very small – no strangers were involved of any kind, we had to do absolutely everything. For Mum, it was all to do with discretion and privacy.’ Miss Allsopp, the eldest of four, was 17 when her mother discovered she had breast cancer. Miss Allsopp disclosed that her younger sister Sofie, left, also a TV presenter, had undergone a double mastectomy to prevent breast cancer . Lady Hindlip, an interior decorator, subsequently endured a mastectomy, lumpectomy, a hysterectomy, had her liver taken out, several rounds of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. She died just a few months after Miss Allsopp disclosed that her younger sister Sofie, also a TV presenter, had undergone a double mastectomy to lower the risk of developing breast cancer, which has afflicted the family’s female relations for generations. In an interview in The Times, Miss Allsopp, who lives with partner Ben Andersen, 55, and their four children, said she wants to help raise the profile of Maggie’s, ‘a charity which does what Mum once did’. Lady Hindlip married Lord Hindlip, 73, left, the Old Etonian former chairman of Christie's, in 1968 and they have two other children, Henry and Natasha . She added: ‘It gives advice and provides a place and a cup of tea for those who have been diagnosed with the disease.’ The Channel 4 star said that she would like a Maggie’s centre attached to every cancer hospital in the country to give emotional support and advice. She said: ‘A lot of times the family will give a party for when the treatment is finished, they want it all to be over, but it’s never over. 'Its impact on relationships and on children is enormous. People can be very angry. All sorts of emotions come out.’","TV host buried her mother in wicker coffin in garden of her Dorset home .

"Britain’s most overcrowded train routes were named yesterday, as it emerged some carry double the number of passengers they should at peak times. The 4.46pm from London Euston to Crewe came out on top, with more people forced to stand than can find seats, according to figures from the Department for Transport. Last autumn, the London Midland service carried an average of 435 standard-class passengers at its most crowded point, more than twice its seated capacity of 206. Scroll down for video . Packed like sardines: A new government league table has laid bare the parlous state of Britain's rail capacity . Critics said that if the train companies were carrying animals instead of human beings they would be prosecuted for cruelty. The findings in a new Government ‘league table’ of cramped carriages come amid rising anger over soaring train fares, bumper rail profits and poor punctuality, that has led angry passengers to demand better value for money. Full to bursting: This map shows trains into almost all the biggest cities in England and Wales are running over-capacity, on average, at peak times (red bar). 100 per cent capacity already means many people are standing . Second worst was South West Trains’ 7.32am commuter service from Woking to London Waterloo, which was designed to carry 738 passengers but actually crammed 1,278 on board - or 540 more than it should. It was followed by the 7.21am Oxford to London Paddington service operated by First Great Western – dubbed ‘Worst Late Western’ by disgruntled passengers - which was 73 per cent overcrowded. And on the 6.33pm Heathrow Express service, 806 passengers squeezed into a space designed for 476 – or 330 too many. But London was not the only city affected. First TransPennine Express’s 6.30am service from Manchester Airport to Middlesbrough was 66 per cent over capacity, with 275 people in a space designed for 166. Stifling: A routine scene on peak time trains from Clapham Junction in London. The capital was hit the worst . The report from the Department for Transport also looked at overcrowding in Spring 2013. Here again the 4.46pm to Crewe had more than double the passengers it should have carroied. It crammed 414 passengers into space for 206 – some 208 more than it should. Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, said: ‘Commuters are being treated worse than cattle when it comes to overcrowding because EU laws prevent animals being transported in such cramped conditions. 'Our real time train figures show four out of every 10 trains in the South East actually running late, means they are getting the worst of all worlds, overcrowded and slow trains.' Attack: Shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh described the report as a 'misery map' The new Government figures show that nearly a quarter (24 per cent) of morning peak trains into the capital are overcrowded with six out of ten passengers left standing. Just under one million passengers arrive into central London every day. The report notes: ‘In London, 120,000 passengers had to stand at trains’ busiest points in the morning peak, 20 per cent of the overall total.’ Based on rail journeys on a typical autumn weekday in 2013, the Department for Transport (DfT) figures showed crowding figures for London, nine other English cities and Cardiff. Overcrowding in London was worst at Paddington station, while there were large increases in overcrowding compared with autumn 2012 at Blackfriars, Euston, King’s Cross and St Pancras stations. First Great Western was the train company with highest level of overcrowding of any London and south east England operator. The next-worse was London Midland. Peak overcrowding across the 11 cities surveyed saw 2.6 per cent of passengers exceeding the capacity of the trains they were travelling on. Overcrowding was higher in the three-hour morning peak from 7am to 10am, with 3.4per cent passengers in excess of capacity – the official measure. Overcrowding was higher in London than in other cities, with an average rate of 3.1 per cent compared to 1 per cent across the other ten cities. The highest overcrowding outside London was in Sheffield, which had 2.6 per cent rate. On London Overground the design of new trains, with fewer seats, meant that in autumn 2013 as many as 50.8 per cent of passengers stood in the morning peak and 45.4 per cent stood in the afternoon peak. David Sidebottom, the director of watchdog Passenger Focus, said: ‘Overcrowding is a daily struggle for many commuters. Our latest rail passenger survey found that 30 per cent of commuters were unhappy about overcrowding on their train.’ Unpleasant: On the London Overground (pictured) around half of all passengers stand in peak times . Rammed: On average, peak trains into the capital run 3.1 per cent over capacity, but some are much worse . There was fury this week as thousands of commuters saw their rail fares double. Changes imposed by the Government on the main rail company in the north of England, Northern Rail, mean some people will be paying 162 per cent more than they did last Friday. It forced Northern Rail to introduce evening peak ticket restrictions on local services to plug the gap caused by the cost to the taxpayer of the West Coast franchise saga in 2012. To soften the blow Mr Osborne also announced that countrywide inflation-busting fare rises planned in January will be limited to the rate of inflation in July - 2.5 per cent – and not rise by an above-inflationary 3.5 per cent as previously planned. Mr Osborne is also scrapping the ‘flex’ system where companies could raise some fares by up to two percentage points. He said more than 250,000 season ticket holders will save £75 across 2014 and 2015. A big increase in capacity was needed to cope with increased demand for trains, he said. He added: ‘This means continued investment in new and longer trains to meet existing demand, as well as ensuring that overcrowding doesn’t get worse as passenger numbers increase as predicted.' James MacColl of the Campaign for Better Transport said: ‘These figures show overcrowding is getting worse at the country’s main stations. ‘With up to one-in-five passengers having to stand and ticket prices increasing much faster than wages, rail commuters will be questioning the value for money they get.’ Labour’s shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh said: ‘As well as enduring inflation-busting fares increases, this misery map of the most-crowded services shows the reality of life for commuters under David Cameron. 'Some services are carrying twice as many passengers as they should, a far cry from the ""comfortable commuting"" which out-of-touch ministers imagine on the railways.’ Transport Minister Claire Perry said: ‘I understand the frustration of rail passengers forced to stand on busy services and that is why I am calling on the operators to do more. ‘Since 1995 passenger journeys on the railway have more than doubled, with 1.6billion journeys being recorded in the last year. Worst-hit: The most overcrowded service was the 4.46pm from London Euston (pictured) to Crewe. The four carriage train had space for 206 standard class passengers, including many standing, but actually carried 435 . ‘This means that on too many journeys, passengers have to stand in cramped conditions. Train operators must act now, they must find new ways to create space on the network and in their trains.’ A spokesman for the Rail Delivery Group, representing Network Rail and rail operators, blamed the growth in passenger numbers over the last 15 years for the problem. ‘The official measure of crowding during peak times now compared with then has remained largely unchanged despite a doubling in passenger journeys,' the spokesman said. 'But we recognise that some services remain crowded and understand people’s frustration when they cannot get a seat.’ Train companies were planning to increase peak-time seats into and out of many major cities by a third in the next five years, the spokesman added.","Trains into almost every major city are running over capacity in peak times .

"This was the moment a rare and unique echidna breeding ritual was caught on camera at Taronga Zoo in Sydney. These super cute five echidnas, also known as spiny anteaters, were captured taking part in what is known as 'trailing'. Female echidna Spike released a hormone called pheromone that attracted her boyfriend Rex along with his other friends Gman, Thorne and Lynx. Scroll down for video . The echidnas can follow each round for up to 10 hours a day over several days in the breeding ritual . Echinda keeper Brett Finlayson said 'it's a mystery' why the females take the males on such a long journey . The boys spent a week and a half following Spike around the enclosure before she finally selected which male and she wanted to mate with, and luckily for him Rex was chosen last month. Echinda keeper Brett Finlayson told Daily Mail Australia says once the echidnas mate there is a 90 per cent chance of pregnancy. He said: 'We are hoping Spike might have laid an egg because she has gone underground. 'This behaviour is also very rare and I believe we might have been the first zoo to capture the footage in the world.' Keepers at Taronga Zoo in Mosman have high hopes for Spike because the last puggle to be born and survive was Pitpa and she was born in 1987. Mr Finlayson said Pitpa did give birth to a puggle two years ago but it sadly died very young. If Spike does fall pregnant it will take her 21 days after mating to lay an egg and she will push the egg into the pouch. Experts don't know why the echidnas follow one another in the 'bumper to bumper style' In the wild, female echidnas can have up to 10 male echidnas following behind them in the breeding process . It will take another 10 days till the egg breaks and the baby will lick on the mum's rich secreted milk. Despite being an Australian icon mystery still surrounds why the echindas when it comes to their unique mating rituals. Once the females release their hormone the male echidnas suddenly start trailing behind the female bumper-to-bumper style, all in a line. Mr Finlayson says the zoo keepers call it 'echinda train' where the group follow one another round nose to bum trying to mate with the female. 'It's a mystery why echidna females find their mate by taking them on an arduous journey through the bush. They're a bit of an enigma. These echidnas, also known as spiny anteaters, were captured taking part in what is known as 'trailing' 'One theory is that the males trail the female until she eventually grows tired and stops walking. 'She will then accept the first male in line as a mate. 'Another thought is that the female recognises the compatibility of the male through smell. It's possible that she is waiting for the right male to be directly behind her. 'It's not necessarily the strongest but the smartest who wins the opportunity to breed.' In the wild, female echidnas can have up to 10 male echidnas following behind them. Taronga Zoo echinda keeper Brett Finlayson said: 'They're a bit of an enigma' Taronga currently has four females and five males involved in a breeding program. The echindas, which live on average to about 40 years old, only breed during winter- June to September- and their breeding intensifies on the winter soltace on June 21, according to Mr Finlayson who has worked with them for 12 years. He added: 'It is notoriously hard to breed echidna offspring in human care, with only approximately 25 echidnas ever bred, and nearly all of those were in the last 10 years. 'They have grabbed me, they are intelligent, fascinating and a pleasure to work with, Pitpa is my favourite.' A zoo spokesman said: 'Echidnas are not endangered in the wild, however loss of habitat has contributed to reduce the distribution of echidnas in Australia. 'It's important that keepers continue to try to breed echidnas in the event that numbers in the wild become critically low.'","Five echidnas were filmed partaking in the breeding ritual called 'trailing'

"A video for the track that has been ‘scientifically proven’ to be the most relaxing song in the world has been released as part of an album with five other songs. Named Weightless, the music can apparently slow the heart rate, reduce blood pressure and decrease levels of cortisol – a steroid hormone released in response to stress. The track has been labelled ‘the most relaxing song in the world’, beating other contenders including Adele and Coldplay. Manchester-based band Marconi Union has released a video for their song Weightless which is said to be the most relaxing song in the world (clip from video shown). In 2011 the song topped a scientific list of relaxing songs. The video sees a drone with lights fly above water in the Lake District . The eight-minute long track was made by Manchester-based Marconi Union in collaboration with the British Academy of Sound Therapy. It was claimed to be the most relaxing song ever after a scientific study by the Mindlab Institution in 2011. 1) Marconi Union - Weightless . 2) Airstream - Electra . 3) DJ Shah - Mellomaniac (Chill Out Mix) 4) Enya - Watermark . 5) Coldplay - Strawberry Swing . 6) Barcelona - Please Don't Go . 7) All Saints - Pure Shores . 8) Adele - Someone Like You . 9) Mozart - Canzonetta Sull'aria . 10) Cafe Del Mar - We Can Fly . Since then the band has expanded upon the original song, releasing a video for it and recording five others. The director of the video Ritchie Johnston said he used a drone because its ‘grace in the air and precise flight capabilities made it the ideal subject for the shoot.’ He continued: ‘Orchestrating the routine together proved challenging as I was using a technique that revealed unperceivable patterns which I was unable to fully comprehend until the project was finally finished. ‘On further discussion we settled on a location for the shoot, a small tarn situated near Blencathra, a mountain in the Lake District.’ He then flew the drone over the waters in a precise pattern, and later used 130 layers of HD video to create a time-lapse effect. Previous research (shown) said the song could slow the heart rate, reduce blood pressure and decrease levels of cortisol. The music has been released as part of an album with five other songs . In 2011 scientists played the song to 40 women and found it to be more effective at helping them relax than songs by Enya, Mozart and Coldplay. The women were connected to sensors and given challenging puzzles to complete against the clock in order to induce a level of stress. They were then played different songs as their heart rate, blood pressure, breathing and brain activity were recorded. Studies found Weightless was 11 per cent more relaxing than any other song and even made many of the women 'drowsy' in the lab. It induced a 65 per cent reduction in overall anxiety and brought them to a level 35 per cent lower than their usual resting rates. The ambient song features guitar, piano and electronic samples of natural soundscapes. Lyz Cooper, founder of the British Academy of Sound Therapy, said Marconi Union had used scientific theory to make the 'perfect relaxing song.' The new album from Marconi Union is called Weightless (Ambient Transmissions Vol 2).","Manchester-based band Marconi Union has released a video for their song Weightless which is said to be the most relaxing song in the world .

"A Connecticut Boy Scout troop leader and elected official may have been sexually assaulting boys between the ages of 11 and 16 for up to 20 years it surfaced last week. David Kress, 52, of Thompson was charged with three counts of employing minors in obscene performance following an investigation, said state police. Victims say that Kress, who lead Boy Scout Troop 66, sexually assaulted the boys during events, at his home, and also 'at locations where Kress was working.' Turned himself in: David Kress, 52, of Thompson was charged with three counts of employing minors in obscene performance following an investigation which led him to turn himself in on October 23 . NBC reports that police were able to obtain an arrest warrant after conducting a 10-month investigation on the alleged incidents against at least three boys, . Finally, Kress turned himself in on October 23. 'It's disturbing for the children involved and for the people in town that knew him,' said town resident Christine Sullivan. 'Children look up to these people, so for anyone to be doing anything that's negative in their lives, it's horrifying and traumatic for them.' In addition to being leader of a Boy Scout Troop, Kress is a member of the town Zoning Board of appeals and was elected to serve a six-year-term for them. First Selectman Paul Lenky of Thompson said that the predicament was 'a tough thing to absorb' and due to Kress' elected status they haven't yet taken action against him. 'Legally, because he's an elected official, we have to take a look at it very closely before we make any decisions,' Lenky said. 'There are a lot of questions to be answered but we're going to have to do it the right way.' Long serving troop leader: David Kress, 52, was a long-serving troop leader who may have been abusing young boys under his supervision for 20 years or more . Boy Scouts of America Communications Director Deron Smith released a statement on Monday. 'The behaviour included in these allegations runs counter to everything for which the Boy Scouts of America stands,' he said. 'Upon learning of these allegations we took immediate action to remove this individual and preclude him from any further participation in the Scouting program, he added. The Boy Scouts of America organization said that child safety is of the utmost importance and that they do background checks on all of their staff members. Kress is due back in court on November 5 and was released on $100,000 bond.

"Tottenham head coach Mauricio Pochettino was impressed by the way Kyle Walker performed on his comeback from a nine-month injury lay-off. The 24-year-old had been laid low since March with a pelvic complaint which caused the right-back to miss the World Cup and the start of the Argentinian's reign in north London. Walker suffered a setback in September and underwent lower abdominal surgery - a move the north London club had hoped to avoid - but on Thursday he at last made his first-team return. Kyle Walker made his long-awaited return to the Tottenham first team against Besiktas on Thursday night . Besiktas winger Kerim Koyunlu tumbles to the ground while the England full back protects the ball . The England full-back admitted he was a 'little rusty' in the 75 minutes he managed in Turkey, but Pochettino was impressed by his display in the 1-0 Europa League defeat to Besiktas. 'I think that he did well,' the Spurs head coach said. 'He had a very good performance. He showed that he is fit and we decided only to play him for 75 minutes because it is good for his first official game after his injury. 'I am happy. I am happy because he is a very good player and an important player for us.' Mauricio Pochettino was impressed by Walker's performance against Besiktas . The Sheffield-born full back couldn't prevent Spurs slipping to a 1-0 loss to Besiktas on his return . Fans at the Ataturk Olympic Stadium had to use their phones after the lights went out to suspend play . Walker's return was one of few highlights on a disappointing evening for Spurs at the Ataturk Olimpiyat Stadium. Pochettino was frustrated by the 'laughable' floodlight failures at Besiktas' temporary home, although he was more annoyed by his players' poor showing in front of goal. Roberto Soldado was the main culprit, with those missed opportunities allowing Cenk Tosun to secure Slaven Bilic's side the victory which saw them go above Tottenham at the top of Group C. Both sides were already assured of a place in Monday's last-32 draw heading into the match, but the defeat means Spurs, in theory, will now get a tougher draw. Walker, who missed the World Cup in Brazil, has been out for nine months with an abdominal injury . Walker shakes hands with members of Tottenham's bench after being substituted in Istanbul . The north Londoners will face a Europa League group winner or one of the best-performing Champions League drop-outs, meaning the mouth-watering prospect of facing Zenit St Petersburg, managed by former Spurs head coach Andre Villas-Boas, is on the cards. 'We need to look forward,' Pochettino said. 'We have to see the draw on Monday. 'It is a shame because we would have finished top of the table (with a point), but now we need to look forward. 'We have to be focused not just on this competition, as we have the Premier League on Sunday and, after, on Wednesday against Newcastle in the Capital One Cup.' 'We need to see the draw on Monday and to win the Europa League. It's a shame we didn't finish on the top of the table.'","Kyle Walker hadn't featured for Spurs since March becuase of pelvic injury .

"A 'remarkable and rare' Iron Age chariot has been uncovered during an excavation in Leicestershire. Archaeologists discovered the bronze chariot fittings, along with horse care tools from 2nd or 3rd Century BC, at an ancient fort in Burrough Hill. Experts believe the chariot was either dismantled or never built, and would have belonged to a high-status individual such as a noble or warrior. The bronze remains of the 2,200 year old chariot were found at Burrough Hill, an Iron Age fort near Melton Mowbray. In this image a chariot linch pin from three angles, showing the intricate decoration at the ends . The archaeologists who found the treasures are said to be shell-shocked by the enormity of their discovery. The decorated fittings from the 2,200-year-old Iron Age chariot appear to have been buried as a religious offering. Researchers also unearthed what are thought to be equestrian tools, including an object that was probably a grooming comb and two curved blades which may have been used in the care of horse hooves. The discovery was made by students from the University of Leicester during their ongoing excavation of the Burrough Hill Iron Age hillfort, near Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire. Parts of the chariot are decorative with Celtic-style designs. In this image are a selection of chariot fittings including a miniature terret ring (a metal hoop for a horse harness) on the upper left, a large terret ring (upper right), strap junction (lower left) and barrel-shaped harness fitting . Around 2,000 years ago, Leicestershire's settlements were built on top of hills rather on on the lowland plains as they are today. Archaeological excavations have found that Leicestershire’s Burrough Hill, Breedon Hill and Beacon Hill were once all ancient hilltop settlements, known as hillforts. From the fifth century BC and throughout the Iron Age, hillforts flourished throughout central and western Europe. The three examples in Leicestershire are some of the best-preserved hillforts in the UK, and tremendous feats of engineering for their time. Burrough Hill, where the chariot was uncovered, is about five miles south of Melton, and is Leicestershire’s largest hillfort. It may have once been the ancient capital of the East Midlands’ native tribe, the Corieltauvi and a key economic centre. From, Burrough Hill ancient Iron Age warriors would have been able to see other important  sites, such as Breedon. There is also evidence the area  has been occupied by humans since the early Bronze Age, around 4,000 years ago. While digging a large, deep pit near the remains of a house within the hillfort, four students found a piece of bronze in the ground, before uncovering more parts nearby. Taken together, the pieces are recognisable as a matching set of bronze fittings from a mid to late Iron Age chariot. After cleaning, decorative patterns could be seen in the metalwork, including a triskele motif showing three waving lines which is similar to the flag of the Isle of Man. The parts include chariot linch pins and other fittings, including rings, straps and what was described as a barrel-shaped harness fitting. 'Realising that I was actually uncovering a hoard that was carefully placed there hundreds of years ago made it the find of a lifetime,' she Nora Battermann, who was among the students who made the discovery. The pieces appear to have been gathered in a box before being planted in the ground on top of a layer of cereal vase and burnt as part of a religious ritual. The case might have doubled as a 'cushion' for the box and also the fuel for the fire. After the burning, the entire deposit was covered by a layer of burnt cinder and slag, where it lay undisturbed for more than 2,200 years until the team uncovered it. Pictured is a iron ‘curry comb’. Researchers believe it may have been used to maintain horses hooves or manufacture harness parts. The archaeologists who found the treasures are said to be shell-shocked by the enormity of their discovery . The discovery was made by students from the University of Leicester during their ongoing excavation of the Burrough Hill Iron Age hillfort (pictured), near Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire. The archaeologists believe the chariot would have belonged to a high-status individual and the burial may have taken place to mark a new season. Dr Jeremy Taylor, who lectures in landscape archaeology at the university, said: 'This is a matching set of highly decorated bronze fittings from an Iron Age chariot - probably from the 2nd or 3rd century BC. 'This is the most remarkable discovery of material we made at Burrough Hill in the five years we worked on the site. This is a very rare discovery, and a strong sign of the prestige of the site. 'The atmosphere at the dig on the day was a mix of ""tremendously excited"" and ""slightly shell-shocked"",' he said. 'I have been excavating for 25 years and I have never found one of these pieces - let alone a whole set. It is a once-in-a-career discovery.' While digging a large, deep pit near the remains of a house within the hillfort, four students found a piece of bronze in the ground, before uncovering more parts nearby.Taken together, the pieces are recognisable as a matching set of bronze fittings from a mid to late Iron Age chariot . The discovery was made at an ancient fort in Burrough Hill, Leicestershire.  Burrough Hill, where the chariot was uncovered and is Leicestershire’s largest hillfort . The co-director of the project, John Thomas, said iron tools were placed around the box before it was then burnt, and covered in a thick layer of cinder and slag. 'The function of the iron tools is a bit of a mystery, but given the equestrian nature of the hoard, it is possible that they were associated with horse grooming. 'One piece in particular has characteristics of a modern curry comb, while two curved blades may have been used to maintain horses hooves or manufacture harness parts.' The parts have been taken to the University of Leicester's School of Archaeology and Ancient History for further analysis. The archaeologists hope they will be put on public display in due course. Before then, they will be on temporary display at the Melton Carnegie Museum, Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, from October 18 to December 13. The University of Leicester has been excavating at Burrough Hill since 2010. The parts have been taken to the University of Leicester's School of Archaeology and Ancient History for further analysis .","Leicester University uncovered the chariot fittings with horse care tools .

"Alan Pardew says £12million France midfielder Remy Cabella is not ready for the demands of the Premier League, warning that he could revert to the bench at Arsenal on Saturday. The 24-year-old has been in and out of the Newcastle side since his big-money move from Montpellier in the summer. Cabella has shown flashes of the promise which won him a place in the France squad at the World Cup in Brazil, but has otherwise looked off the pace of the English top flight. Remy Cabella started in Newcastle's win over Chelsea, but was replaced after 53 minutes with the score at 0-0 . Cabella has played some part in 14 of Newcastle's Premier League games, but not established himself . And Pardew said: ‘I’ll pick and choose (when he plays). He’s not ready for the demands of this division yet. ‘Before I started him against Chelsea I said that he would be like this all year for us – he’ll be in, out, he’ll start, he’ll be sub. Newcastle boss Pardew, November's manager of the month, says Cabella may sit out against Arsenal . ‘The way he plays, sometimes he can get lost a little bit. But when the game gets open, like it did second half at Burnley and Spurs, he can have more and more influence when we get a bit more possession. ‘It actually favours him a little bit when the game slows down and he comes off the bench and can affect the game.’ The Newcastle manager says coming off the bench suits the Frenchman's game as he adapts to the league .

"Hibs have confirmed the club is in ‘complex negotiations’ over a restructuring of its £5.5million debt. The Easter Road outfit insisted that talk of a ‘total’ debt write-off was ‘not based on fact’ and was ‘speculative’ but it is understood discussions between the club, the holding company and the bank centre on significantly reducing Hibs’ arrears. As the Easter Road club announced a later-than-usual annual general meeting date, however, chief executive Leeann Dempster insisted a deal to place the club in the black is not close. Hibernian chief executive Leeann Dempster says a deal to put the club in the black is not close . Normally held in November, the club AGM will now take place on January 28 to allow talks between Hibs, the club’s bank and HFC Holdings to continue to take place on debt restructuring. HFC Holdings are Sir Tom Farmer’s company, through which the Kwik Fit chief executive owns the Easter Road club. The 74-year-old tycoon bought Hibs in 1990 to avoid a hostile takeover bid by ex-Hearts chief Wallace Mercer. In a brief statement issued on Tuesday night on the club website, chief executive Dempster confirmed talks have been ongoing ‘for some time’ and ‘have focused on the club’s long-term future’. She added: ‘Discussions have taken place involving the club, HFC Holdings and the bank. We have decided to hold the AGM slightly later than usual in order to allow these talks to be concluded. The outcome will be reflected in the board’s plans for the future which we will present at the AGM and talk in detail to our supporters.’ The club's relegation under Terry Butcher sparked a year of fan unrest at Easter Road . In the last set of published club accounts, up to July 2013, Hibs’ net debt stood at £5.5m. But HFC Holdings Ltd boast substantial assets in the form of Easter Road and the club’s East Mains training centre. The Hibs debt restructuring talks come at the end of a year of fan unrest sparked by the club’s dismal relegation under Terry Butcher. The backlash led to supporter consortium BuyHibs being formed to try to raise cash to launch a buyout not dissimilar to the way The Foundation of Hearts (FoH) are funding their takeover of the Tynecastle club aided by the wealth of IT tycoon Ann Budge. In their brief statement, the club added: ‘Hibernian FC today announced that the AGM for shareholders will take place on January 28. This will allow complex negotiations between the club, the holding company and the bank to be concluded. ‘The talks have been ongoing for some time, and have focused on the club’s long-term future. Media reports of a total debt write-off are not based on fact, and are speculative.’ Dempster and chairman Rod Petrie have seen Hibs struggle on the pitch in the Scottish Championship . A debt-free Hibs would clearly be more attractive should Farmer wish to sell his 90-per-cent share but he has maintained his stance that any new owners would have to be ‘right’ for the club. Having rescued the Easter Road outfit from the clutches of an unwanted takeover by Hearts’ Wallace Mercer and the brink of receivership in 1990, Farmer has talked of saving the club for the local community and is said to be keen to leave a ‘legacy’. Whether this includes selling his stake remains to be seen but one report yesterday put Edinburgh-born businessman Richard Skellett in pole position to take over the club should the 74-year-old Farmer wish to sell up. The CEO and chairman of Allied Worldwide, an IT managed services company based in High Wycombe near London, Skellett is said to have been involved in discussions with Hibs for the last two years and was pictured at Easter Road for the Edinburgh derby against Hearts in October. In February this year, Dundee United announced they had cleared their £3m bank debts in a restructuring deal. Then in March, Kilmarnock had £9.4m cleared from the club’s liabilities. And last month, Aberdeen revealed that a £14.5m debt to Willie and Elaine Donald had been wiped from the club’s ledger.","Hibernian are trying to reduce the arrears of the Edinburgh-based club .

"Two teenagers have been charged after shocking footage of a tirade of racist abuse on a Brisbane train went viral, which even prompted a response from Prime Minister Tony Abbott. A 17-year-old Brisbane man has been charged with two counts each of assault occasioning bodily harm and creating a nuisance on a railway. He was further charged with one count each of threatening violence, common assault and using a carriage service to menace or harass. An 18-year-old Ipswich man has also been charged with one count of creating a nuisance on a railway. Scroll down for video . Shocking footage of an intoxicated young man hurling a tirade of racist abuse on a Brisbane train . Both men are due to appear in the Brisbane Magistrates Court on Monday. On Saturday night, a video of the October 2 incident was posted on YouTube and went viral, which sparked a police investigation. The video shows a drunk man, believed to be Kader Boumzar, screaming obscenities at a Queensland Rail security guard after he was told to take his feet off the seat about 11.50pm at Indooroopilly station on October 2. The 17-year-old and an 18-year-old were questioned by detectives on Sunday afternoon before charges were laid. Prime Minister Tony Abbott slammed the teenager in the video, labelling his behaviour as 'deplorable'. Mr Abbott said he had been briefed about the incident, which he labelled as 'un-Australian', by Queensland Premier Campbell Newman. 'Just as I think it's un-Australian to defend death cults, I think it's un-Australian to abuse people in a public place just because you don't like the way they look, or you don't like the way they dress, or you make assumptions about what they believe,' Mr Abbott told reporters in Brisbane on Sunday. Another security guard, wearing a blue top (pictured left), is seen walking towards the teenager as he continues to drunkenly slur his words to another train worker . Teenager Kader Boumzar took to Facebook on Sunday to apologise for hurling the racial abuse. 'I'm really sorry to everyone that was affected by the video I really can not remember anything out of all honesty the post made before was someone else I know this is no excuse,' he posted. 'But can you all see from my point of view that I was a f*****g idiot and I'm really sorry.' In the video - which attracted three million hits in under 24 hours - a 17-year-old man allegedly refers to a train guard as 'n*****' and a 'black c***' repeatedly before he continues to explode into a racist rant during the five-minute video. 'Do you want to come to Australia to learn some proper English?' the teenager said in the video. 'That is the issue c*** - learn some f*****g English 'cause this is Australia c*** because I can't understand you.' 'No, look, my n****r brother - I got my feet off the f*****g seat.' He runs towards a door and speaks to another attendant before the guard approaches him again. 'Don't touch me - I don't want to speak to you - I don't understand you,' the 17-year-old said. 'Bro, if you want to be a security guard, learn some English first.' An attendant is heard telling the young man to 'get off' at the next stop. Another security guard, wearing a blue top, is seen walking towards the teenager as he continues to drunkenly slur his words to another train worker. 'I'm trying to get to the next station - l'll sit on this f*****g train for hours if I have to,' the teenager said. 'I'll hold all you f*****s up. I really don't care. Especially this black c***. 'Do you even have an Australian citizenship, you f*****g n****r?' The video shows a drunk 17-year-old man - who has now been charged by police - hurling abuse at a security guard . The person filming, who appears to be a friend of the teenager, is recording the incident, while he is heard laughing hysterically behind the camera. 'This n****r comes into my country and tells me to put my feet off the seat, when my feet are on the f*****g newspaper, you f*****g black dog,' the teenager continues in his video. 'What are you, Fijian or f*****g African c***. I hope all you n****r die.

As he continues to explode into a racist rant, other train passengers are heard in the video, mumbling words to the teenager, and he turns around and starts walking to them and says 'What?'

He tells him to 'get off the train' too. 'You have a problem too? Make me get off c***.' The security guard walks over and stands in front of the commuters, as he gestures his hand to the passengers to stand back .

'It wasn't on the seat, it was on the newspaper mate, alright? So if you want to cause a problem, then f*** you.' His friend is heard laughing as he says: 'Let's go'. But the teenager responds and says: 'No, no, no. I'm not done with this.' Train passengers are seen looking outraged as Boumzar is uttering racial insults in front of them . One woman is heard in the background, saying: 'Some of us want to go home.' While another man, wearing a dark blue t-shirt and a black cap, intervenes and says: 'Really?' 'Really? I f*****g work all day and I got to deal with this s***,' the man said. 'What the f*** is your story? Get the f*** out of the f*****g train man.' The teenager responded: 'What the f*** c***, I'm trying to get to the f*****g next station c***.' The man said: 'It's not really f*****g working is it?'.

"An Indiana man who admitted fatally stabbing and shooting a fellow Purdue University student inside a crowded classroom was sentenced on Friday to the maximum 65 years in prison after telling a judge he lied about being mentally ill. 'I killed Andrew Boldt because I wanted to, and I do what I want to do,' said killer Cody Cousins, 24, in court on Friday. 'I will deal with the consequences later.' Tippecanoe Superior Court Judge Thomas Busch cited Cody Cousins' lack of remorse, the viciousness of the Jan. 21 attack on Andrew Boldt and Cousins' apparent pride in Boldt's death in rejecting the defense's request that Cousins be found guilty but mentally ill. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Maximum sentence: Confessed killer Cody Cousins was sentenced the maximum sentence of 65 years in prison on Friday and told the judge he killed his classmate because he 'wanted to' No remorse: Cody Cousins showed absolutely no remorse in court on Friday and says that he does what he wants to do and then deals 'with the consequences later' Murdered: Andrew Boldt was killed by classmate Cody Cousins in a 'crime of hatred' because 'Andrew was everything he was not,' said prosecutors . 'That's not insanity. That's not mental illness,' Busch said, calling the slaying a 'crime of hatred' and likening it to the biblical story of Cain and Abel. Both Cousins and Boldt were teaching assistants in Purdue's electrical engineering program at the time of the attack. Prosecutor Pat Harrington said Cousins, who had struggled in some classes and left Purdue at one point, envied Boldt, whom witnesses described as a humble man and top student. 'Andrew was everything he was not,' Harrington said. Boldt, of West Bend, Wisconsin, was shot five times, including three times in the face, and suffered 19 cuts as horrified students looked on. Feigned insanity: Cody Cousins admitted to a judge that he'd pretended to be crazy to get a lighter sentence and in reality was aware of his actions and wanted to kill Andrew Boldt . Guilty: Cody Cousins was sentenced on Friday to the maximum 65 years in prison after telling a judge he lied about being mentally ill and saying he knew he wanted to kill Andrew Boldt . 'This is the worst homicide I've ever seen,' said Dr. Elmo Griggs, the pathologist who performed Boldt's autopsy. Cousins pleaded guilty to the slaying last month. Defense attorneys argued that the 24-year-old Warsaw man was mentally ill at the time of the attack and asked that he receive treatment now instead of upon his release from prison. Defense attorney Kirk Freeman said his client was 'so sick, he may not know he's sick.' Cousins' mother testified that there was a history of mental illness in her family and said she had her son hospitalized on a 72-hour psychiatric hold in the summer of 2013. Cousins told Judge Busch at a May 8 hearing that he was taking medication to treat schizophrenia. But he testified Friday that he lied to doctors about having auditory hallucinations. Experts who examined Cousins said he didn't show signs of mental illness the day Boldt was killed. Boldt's parents testified Friday that they cry every day over the loss of their son. 'Every single day I think of how terrified he must have been, having that gun pointed to him,' Mary Boldt said during a statement she directed at Cousins. 'It brings me to tears.' 'Mr. Cousins, you blasted holes in many, many hearts.' Cousins has been jailed since his arrest soon after the attack. He will receive credit for time served.","'I killed Andrew Boldt because I wanted to, and I do what I want to do,' said killer Cody Cousins, 42, in court on Friday .

"Bob Hawke reveals the real story behind his clash with cranky Frank Sinatra when Ol' Blue Eyes took aim at female journalists in Australia and sparked a union revolt against his tour. He eats a tin of black cherries every day 'to ward off arthritis' and uses a vibrating piece of gym equipment to keep fit, 'one of his secrets of eternal youth'. The former PM, 85, remains a raconteur of the highest order but as for his cooking, Kitchen Cabinet host Annabel Crabb says, he rates a six out of 10. 'I would call him a very credible middle order batsmen in the Prime Minister’s Eleven in the kitchen,' she said. Scroll down for video . Former Prime Minister Bob Hawke with wife Blanche and Kitchen Cabinet host Annabel Crabb . Steamed fish is on the menu when Kitchen Cabinet visits the plush Sydney home of former Prime Minister Bob Hawke . As cheeky as ever. The former PM is described by host Annabel Crabb as being 'enthusiastic' as ever, telling several funny anecdotes during hours of filming at his luxury Sydney home . 'I asked Blanche (Bob's wife) to rate him one to 10 in the kitchen and she said maybe a one. She was definitely playing it down, I give him at least a six, he is not a customary figure in the kitchen, once he turned his mind to it, he pulled it off brilliantly I think, any chef that can conclude a meal by offering you a session of putt putt on the roof of his house gets extra points.' Age has not wearied him, the former Labor leader as cheeky as ever. 'There’s a couple of moments (during the shoot) he’s just kind of enthusiastic,' Annabel Crabb revealed. 'We were doing a tour of the house and we come across this piece of gym equipment, which essentially is a giant vibrator. 'I noticed it in the games room and the next second he’s on it and he says ‘jump on’ and the next thing I’m riding this enormous vibrator in Bob Hawke’s house, a very weird place to be. 'This is kind of one of his secrets of eternal youth, he jumps on this thing and gets violently jiggled up and down. It’s a legitimate piece of gym equipment,’ she laughed. 'I had no idea that being shaken violently is something that keeps you healthy but apparently it’s good for your circulation. Bob Hawke and Blanche d'Alpuget married in 1995 . 'He’s just an enthusiast, the way that he and Blanche interact, they’re kind of like a couple of teenagers, the whole experience is hilarious and sort of touching and a little sort of ""golly, I hope I’m like that when I’m 85"". 'He was also endlessly willing to talk and his recall is unbelievably good, he’s 85 years old yet he’s still as gregarious and still takes as much enjoyment in telling a yarn and his recall of dates and details is still quite spectacular.' Kitchen Cabinet, as Crabb describes the show, 'invades the home, four cameras, lighting and al' that stuff' where the crew can spend up to eight hours filming and interviewing a politician - usually a current MP but she was happy that Bob Hawke was 'a great privilege'. Bob Hawke the politician on the hustings in 1983. He would win that year's election and serve as PM until 1991 . He tells the show host that being genuine ultimately wins voters over. 'I wanted to talk to him about his views on politics today,' Crabb said. 'The thing about Hawke is that he is the prime minister that got away with everything, he kind of broke the rule book on things you aren’t and are allowed to do as a political leader. The womanising, the drinking, the weeping, the doldrums that he fell into when he was having a difficult time in his family life. 'His view and it is still very robust today, is that the secret to political success is to love people. 'To have this sort of relationship with the Australian people that means that people are persuaded of your bona fides they’ll overlook or forgive you for any boo-boos you make along the way.' Hawke was Australia's third-longest serving PM, from 1983 to 1991 before being toppled by treasurer Paul Keating in a party room challenge. 'I asked him about his advice to Bill Shorten, it’s interesting advice, to not let go of your heritage and to listen to the people and to be genuine in everything that you do,' she added. He did bristle at one line of questioning. 'You have, and I say this to Hawke during the interview, to be a political leader you do have to be a tiny bit crazy in the brain, you know?' Crabb said. 'They’re not normal people. I don’t say that to be insulting, I think he kind of thought I was being insulting. You have to have a different kind of mental make-up, somebody normal wouldn’t last two days in that sort of job. Bob Hawke pictured during a media conference at the Australian embassy in Washington DC. Kitchen Cabinet host Annabel Crabb was particularly taken by his recollections of meeting US President Ronald Reagan . Bob Hawke pictured with his first wife Hazel. They married in 1956 and had four children . 'You have to have this incredible combination of attributes, you have to decisive enough and convinced enough of your plans and your vision to be able to get up out of bed every morning and face the world even when people are saying you’re an idiot and you’re running the place into rack and ruin.' She believes that Gough Whitlam’s death rather than diminish from the episode will, in fact, shine an even more important light on her time with Bob Hawke, as it provides an insight into what makes our former political leaders tick and how politics has changed. 'Whitlam’s political life was extraordinary – the thing that I think is inspirational is that he was a hungry searcher for wisdom all of his life,' Annabel Crabb said. 'He drew from the classics, from the arts, from science and infused his sense of public duty and leadership with all that he absorbed from the world around him. 'I think being a leader that finds inspiration from history and in reading is quite an important thing. If there is one thing that troubles me about modern politics is that its practitioners barely have the time to scratch themselves let alone to find ideas in the world around them. 'Hawkey had a very different approach – he derived energy from the people around him, he’s a great lover of the Australian people. 'He found his inspiration and energy from being among people, whether the shopping centres or sporting events or getting out on the punt. He was hungry for human contact.' Bob Hawke (right) paid tribute to his Labor PM predecessor Gough Whitlam (centre) today after his death, saying 'Australia was a better country because of the life and work of Gough Whitlam'. The ALP leaders are pictured with Malcolm Fraser (left) who succeeded Whitlam as PM in 1975 . Bob Hawke today paid tribute to Gough Whitlam 'that this is not a time of sadness, he was ready to go and his family was ready for him to go'. Mr Hawke also added that Australia is a better country because of the life and work of Gough Whitlam and that he made the ALP relevant and led the party with great imagination. 'He steams me a fish, which was really kind of delicious and made a sauce to go with it. Having decided to cook lunch he threw himself whole-heartedly into it,' Kitchen Cabinet host Annabel Crabb said of Bob Hawke . Crabb continued, recalling that Bob Hawke 'lives to tell stories'. 'We could really have made it a 90 minute episode just with back to back yarns – there is quite a long story about his personal clash with Frank Sinatra which was so fabulous, which we will put up on-line because people shoudn’t miss it,' she added. 'Half an hour is not that long when we’ve got a fish to steam and he’s got this hilarious story about his first ever interaction with Ronald Reagan when he was first Prime Minister. 'The insight he can give to conducting foreign affairs as a new prime minister into the art of being a successful prime minister for such a long period is just invaluable.' And she finds that the relationship with Paul Keating still simmers. 'There’s such an unbelievable kind of slow motion tango going on between these two men (Hawke and Keating),' she said. 'So extraordinary, one of the most fascinating things of looking at politics is that these giants enmesh and disentangle from each other and then they can’t quite ever let go of each other. 'Every year or two there’s a public conflagration between them, they share their mixed recollections of whose idea it was to float the dollar, whose idea it was to reform the economy who was more committed to making these changes and who did more to bring them about. 'Will we ever get to the end of the Keating-Hawke wars? I suspect not.' Kitchen Cabinet airs tonight (Tuesday) at 8pm on ABC1 .","Series four of Kitchen Cabinet returns tonight at 8pm on ABC1 .

"Western Australia batsman Tom Beaton caused a mild scare in Perth when he ducked into a bouncer and was hit on the head against Victoria. Beaton, 24, wore the delivery from Dan Christian on his helmet and after the impact of the ball players from both sides rushed to see if he was OK. Fortunately the Western Australia No 3 was fine and seemed more sheepish about the way he played the delivery.

Glenn Maxwell places his hand on the opposing batsman's head as both sides show their concern . There was relief all around the WACA ground, especially in light of the death of Phillip Hughes' death two weeks ago. The left-hander died at the age of 25 after being hit by a short delivery from Sean Abbott and he has been mourned during Australia's first Test against India this week. Beaton went on to make just 18 but in the ground they were just happy that he continued batting. His team-mate Sam Whiteman was also in the wars, being hit on the head by a fielder's throw.

"The prime suspect in the murder of schoolgirl Alice Gross walked into a homeless shelter with her body in a bag, a hostel manager has claimed. Steven Mendonca described how convicted killer Arnis Zalkalns begged for his help while trying to enter a hostel in Harlesden, North London. He claimed that the Latvian builder was carrying a heavy, 5ft-long bag over his shoulders. Scroll down for video . Schoolgirl Alice Gross (pictured, left) went missing in August and her body was discovered a month later. Prime suspect Arnis Zalkalns (right) was found hanged in Boston Manor Park, west London, four days later . Police removed Zalkalns' body from dense woodland in west London near to where the teenager was found . Mr Mendonca, 33, told The Sun: 'I am convinced Alice's body was in that bag. It was like a builder's bag with a big strap and it was weighing him down.' The incident took place on September 5 - just one day after Zalkalns was reported missing and 10 days before he was named as a prime suspect in the 15-year-old's disappearance. Zalkalns was found dead in Boston Manor Park, west London, on October 4. Four days earlier the teenager's body was pulled from a river less than 30 minutes walk from the hostel. Mr Mendonca, who reported his exchange to the police, claimed that Zalkans begged to be let in but that he turned him away because there were no rooms at the hostel. He said: 'He had this cold, chilling look about him. He was in a trance. Something about him made me feel uneasy.' Well-wishers left flowers around the Clock Tower in Hanwell Broadway in memory of teenager Alice Gross .

Expert police divers were deployed to search the canal at Hanwell Lock as they tried to find the teenager . Rosalind Hodgkiss (pictured, right) and Jose Gross, Alice's parents, have been devastated by her death . He added: 'What I find incredible is he managed to walk around for nine days after the murder unnoticed by the police.' Alice Gross was last seen on CCTV walking along the Grand Union Canal in Hanwell on August 28. Alice Gross, pictured at 14, went missing in August . Zalkalns was seen on video footage cycling along the same towpath minutes after Alice. He went missing from his home in Hanwell days later. The teenager's disappearance sparked a large scale police search that involved 17 other police forces. The search was the largest operation that Scotland Yard has carried out since the aftermath of the July 7 bombings an involved around 600 officers, including underwater experts from five forces and victim detection dogs and handlers from four outside the Met. The 15-year-old's body was found by London Fire Brigade divers on September 30, wrapped in a plastic bag and weighted down in a shallow stretch of the River Brent. She was identified using dental records and a post-mortem examination proved inconclusive, a brief hearing in to her death heard earlier this month. After their daughter's body was discovered Rosalind Hodgkiss and Jose Gross, said they had been left 'completely devastated' by her death. The statement added: 'Why anyone would want to hurt her is something that we are struggling to come to terms with. 'Alice was a loving and much-loved daughter and sister, a quirky live spark of a girl, beautiful inside and out. 'She was a funny companion, a loyal friend, both passionate and compassionate, and so talented, with a bright future ahead of her. She brought so much joy to our family and those who knew her. 'We still don't know who is responsible for this crime and we ask that people continue to help the police by giving them information that could help bring the perpetrator to justice. Zalkalns was named as the prime suspect in the case as police tried to find the teenager's murderer. His body was found four days after her body was retrieved. The Latvian had served seven years in prison for bludgeoning and stabbing his wife Rudite to death. He worked as a general labourer at a building site in Isleworth, west London and is believed to have come to the UK in 2007. But authorities in Britain are thought to have had no record of his murder conviction.

"A young mother died after her car crashed into a slow-moving HGV - but her five-week-old baby escaped completely unharmed, an inquest heard today. Emergency teams and witnesses were at a loss to explain why Joanna Bull ploughed into the slow-moving lorry on the M40 near Bicester in Oxfordshire, leaving her with fatal injuries. Her baby, Ruby, was rescued from the green Peugeot 406 estate car and cared for by other motorists until emergency crews arrived. Joanna Bull (pictured) died after her car crashed into a slow-moving HGV - but her five-week-old baby escaped completely unharmed, an inquest heard . Paramedics rushed to the scene on the southbound carriageway near junction 9 of the motorway but were unable to save the infant's mother, who was declared dead at the scene. Witnesses told the inquest in Oxford that Mrs Bull, who had married her husband David only a year earlier, appeared to make no attempt to stop or avoid the red articulated lorry. A police investigation concluded she may have fallen asleep at the wheel, suffered a medical episode, been distracted or lost concentration. The 29-year-old was travelling from her home in Kenilworth, Warwickshire, to visit her mother, Teresa, with her first born child when the accident happened at around 11am on Friday, June 13. Philip Crawley, who was driving with his wife Marilyn, was in the inside lane queuing in traffic waiting to get off the motorway when the crash happened. Mr Crawley told the inquest: 'I was about five or six car lengths behind the lorry in front when a green Peugeot estate just came across in front of me. 'It didn't brake and it didn't swerve. It was going at about 70mph. 'It was strange, there seemed to be no input from the driver, it just glided past.' Nigel Bennett was driving the HGV which Mrs Bull crashed into. He said he was driving at about 10mph at the time. 'At that point I heard a loud bang and my vehicle appeared to be pushed forward, making me go faster than I was,' said Mr Bennett. Witnesses described seeing a cloud of smoke following the impact. The lorry driver pulled over and walked to the back of his vehicle, where he saw the mangled wreckage of Mrs Bull's car. Mrs Bull's five-week-old baby Ruby (pictured), was rescued from the green Peugeot 406 estate car moments after the collision and looked after until emergency crews arrived . At the same time, Mr and Mrs Crawley approached the car and noticed baby Ruby in the back seat. They took her back to their car while emergency services were called. Ruby was airlifted to hospital as a precaution but was not injured in the dramatic crash. Home Office pathologist, Dr Nicholas Hunt, said one person claimed to have seen Mrs Bull slumped at the wheel at the time of the crash but no other witnesses were able to confirm this. Dr Hunt said there was no evidence that Mrs Bull had suffered complications arising from her recent pregnancy and said she was alive at the time of the crash. 'She had injuries that were completely unsurvivable,' Dr Hunt told the hearing. 'She would have been rendered immediately unconscious and unaware.' A small brake fluid leak was found on one of the rear tyres of her car, but this was not thought to have contributed to the incident. Forensic collision investigator Andrew Evans said there was no evidence of any alcohol or drugs in Mrs Bull and that driving conditions were good at the time. 'I cannot rule out as factors for this collision fatigue, a temporary medical emergency that has not been revealed, a prolonged distraction or a loss of concentration.' Oxfordshire Assistant Coroner Nicholas Graham, who recorded a verdict of accidental death, described the death as a 'tragedy.' Mr Graham said: 'There was no direct medical evidence to suggest that Joanna had blacked out, although it seems to me that is a possibility. 'There is no evidence that somehow this was an intentional act on her part or due to dangerous driving by other road users. The family were travelling to Warwickshire on the M40 (pictured) to visit Joanna's family for the first time after Ruby's birth. The 29-year-old's family paid tribute to 'beautiful and vibrant' Jo . 'The difficult issue is whether she somehow lost consciousness prior to impact. 'It seems to me almost impossible to speculate. It could have been any number of those factors that played a role.' The medical cause of death was multiple blunt injuries. Members of Mrs Bull's family attended the inquest, including her husband, but declined to comment at its conclusion. Following her death, she was described as 'vibrant, beautiful, and caring,' in a tribute released by her family. 'Jo, who was tragically killed in a car accident, was a loving wife, mum, daughter, sister, granddaughter, niece and friend to so many and loved by all who knew her,' they said. 'She died on her way to visit her mum Teresa, with her five-week-old daughter Ruby, to meet newborn cousin Harry for the first time, and to have a catch up with big sister Soph, and niece Nelly aged two. 'Jo was vibrant, beautiful, and caring in so many ways. A girl who added zest to a room and who had found true love and happiness with her husband of just one year, Dave. 'To have her taken from her family at such a happy time is utterly unbearable. 'Jo, we never had the chance to say a proper goodbye, but we will never forget how much fun and laughter you brought into all our lives, you will remain in our hearts and memories always.' Mrs Bull, who had a degree in Animal Science, ran a day care and boarding home for dogs from the livestock farm she rented with her husband. The pair who met at a young farmers club, bred both cattle and sheep at the farm in Kenilworth.","Experts at a loss to explain why Joanna Bull's car ploughed in to a lorry .

"While at first glance these pictures might seem like another bizarre Chinese game show task, they actually have a very serious message. Organised by the Hunan Cancer Hospital, the stunt aimed to raise awareness- and thus garner donations- for breast cancer in China. Men were put in the mastectomy bras worn by women who have lost either one or both breasts to cancer, and asked to perform basic tasks such as carrying buckets of water and skipping to demonstrate the difficulties faced by survivors and patients . The men were put in the mastectomy bras worn by women who have lost either one or both breasts to cancer . Organised by the Hunan Cancer Hospital, the men were asked to perform tasks such as skipping in the bras . However, the resulting pictures of the men bouncing around in bras in front of a pink backdrop have drawn criticism from many who accuse the campaign of making light of the serious disease, or simply of being 'creepy'. Users of China's biggest social network Weibo have been speaking out against the campaign. One - identified on Weibo as LienKo35 - said: 'This is deeply creepy. There is a serious message to deliver about breast cancer in China and they put on what looks like a gimps' convention, adding, 'Why not have real women there telling their real stories? Who cares what a middle aged businessman thinks or how he feels.' Others call the event 'perverted' or accuse it of being too light-hearted for the message it is trying to convey. The campaign has come under fire for being 'creepy' and too light hearted for the message it is trying to convey . But the Hunan Cancer Hospital is standing by its awareness-raising stunt. The Metro reports that Spokesman Long She said: 'It was intended to be a way to show men how women who've had mastectomies suffer when they're doing ordinary household things day in day out.' He added: 'We think we put over a serious message in a way people will remember.' The hospital, situated in Changsha, Hunan, is a leading research and treatment centre for all types of cancer. According to a recent report by the World Health Organisation, China is one of the country's worst hit by rising cancer rates since 2012, while China Daily reports that only 50 per cent of women could name some tell-tale signs of breast cancer.","Organised by Hunan Cancer Hospital it aimed to raise breast cancer  awareness .

"Dan Lydiate has completed his dual contract move from Racing Metro to the Ospreys that will 'send a message' about Welsh rugby's new bargaining power. The British and Irish Lions flanker joins Sam Warburton on a National Dual Contract, as Welsh bosses aim to reverse the exodus of top talent to England and France. The 26-year-old has been released by Racing Metro for an immediate return to Wales, and will start training with the Ospreys later this week. Ospreys Dan Lydiate has signed a dual contract with the region and the Welsh Rugby Union . Lydiate was given dispensation to join the Ospreys rather than return to first club Newport Gwent Dragons, with his wife keen to be close to her family in west Wales. 'I am extremely pleased we have been able to bring a player of Dan's undoubted calibre back home,' said WRU chairman Gareth Davies. 'His decision will send a message out to Welsh qualified players that staying in Wales under the protection of a National Dual Contract offers a great opportunity.' Lydiate left the Dragons for Racing Metro last summer after seven years at the club but failed to settle in the French Top 14. His quickfire return to the Welsh set-up follows months of politicking that led to the Rugby Services Agreement between union bosses and regional chiefs. Head coach Warren Gatland will now turn attention to completing the remaining 10 dual deals he has lined up. 'I am delighted to have secured a National Dual Contract and I am looking forward to doing my best for the Ospreys while I aim to win selection for Wales,' said Lydiate. Lydiate tackles Jean de Villiers of South Africa during the Castle Lager Outgoing Tour match in November . 'Having a National Dual Contract gives me the certainty I need for my future and I will now be able to concentrate one hundred per cent on my rugby. 'I enjoyed my time with Racing Metro but this is the right move for me as I want to achieve my full potential as a player based here in Wales.' Chief executive Roger Lewis said Lydiate's deal represents the fruit of almost three years of pressing for dual contracts from the WRU. 'This is a landmark day for Welsh rugby and I am grateful to all involved for the level of cooperation this signifies,' said Lewis. 'National Dual Contracts will help us keep international class talent here in Wales available for Regional rugby and for international selection. 'The WRU has been actively attempting to introduce National Dual Contracts for some two-and-a-half years, so securing Dan as a National Dual Contract player is a significant step forward. British and Irish Lions flanker joins Sam Warburton (above) on a National Dual Contract . 'Dan Lydiate suddenly became available while Warren was preparing his list of National Dual Contract candidates which offered us the opportunity to bring a key international player back to Wales. 'All the players on National Dual Contracts will get the best coaching and conditioning while having their careers managed in ways which will ensure they achieve and maintain their full potential with the Regions and Wales. 'The aim of the contracts is to stem the flow of our best talent abroad and to ensure the players staying in Wales will have the very best care to prolong their careers at the highest level.' Wales boss Gatland expects the dual contract system to boost Test results in the long-run. 'This is an important step forward for Welsh rugby and will reap rewards in playing standards over the long term,' said Gatland. 'We can now focus on ensuring all our best young players realise the best way for them to realise their talent in full is to stay in Wales under the new structure we have created.'","Dan Lydiate has been released by Racing Metro .

"Richard Dunne looked down and out when he was released by Aston Villa 18 months ago. At 33, he was considered over the hill and was facing the stark reality of rapidly tumbling down the Football League. In 2009, he warranted a £5million fee moving from Manchester City to Villa but in his final season there he failed to play a single game for the club and was deemed surplus to requirements. Richard Dunne rolled back the years with an almost unbeatable performance against Burnley . 18 months ago, Dunne was down and out, but he looked at home in the Premier League on Saturday .

"The Health Secretary will tell staff that a culture change is needed to stop cash-strapped hospitals wasting as much as £2.5billion a year on needless mistakes . The NHS could afford to employ tens of thousands of extra nurses if it stamped out basic errors which put patient safety at risk, Jeremy Hunt will say today. The Health Secretary will tell staff that a culture change is needed to stop cash-strapped hospitals wasting as much as £2.5billion a year on needless mistakes. Experts estimate that around 755,000 patients – one in 20 – are harmed every year in hospital. Common avoidable mistakes include bed ulcers, falls, blood clots, drug errors and infections. In a speech at Birmingham Children’s Hospital today, Mr Hunt will tell NHS staff that poor care is the ‘most wasteful and expensive’ failing made by hospitals – meaning patients suffer complications and longer stays as a result. Research by independent economists released last night reveals that the average patient who develops a bed sore spends 12 more days in hospital, adding an average of £2,500 to their NHS costs. The report estimates that errors in patient safety cost the NHS between £1billion and £2.5billion a year, including the expense of extra treatment, bed space and nursing, as well as huge compensation payouts. This would cover the salaries of at least 60,000 extra nurses. Mr Hunt will say: ‘I want every director of every hospital trust to understand the impact this harm is having not just on their patients, but also on their finances. ‘And I want every nurse in the country to understand that if we work together to make the NHS the safest healthcare organisation in the world, we could potentially release resources for additional nurses, additional training, and additional time to care.’ He will add: ‘More resources should be invested in improving patient care rather than wasted on picking up the pieces when things go wrong. ‘It would be tempting to set up a new target or issue a new ministerial decree. But that would be a mistake. Because the culture change we need to develop has to come from inside, not because hospitals are being forced from the outside. Eliminating the £2.5bn waste would cover the salaries of at least 60,000 extra nurses. File picture . ‘If you’re short of money, poor care is about the most wasteful and expensive thing you can do.’ Last year the NHS spent £1.3billion on payouts after being sued by patients over care errors. Four areas of poor patient safety highlighted by the Department of Health include falls and trips, bed ulcers, urinary infections caused by poorly fitted catheters, and deep vein thrombosis, which together cost the NHS an estimated £200million a year in extra care. But Dr Peter Carter, of the Royal College of Nursing, said the Government needs to invest in more staff before patient care can be improved. ‘Falls and preventable conditions such as pressure ulcers happen when there are not enough staff on a ward to care properly for every patient, not because nurses are unaware that these things should be prevented,’ he said. Labour health spokesman Jamie Reed said: ‘Under David Cameron thousands of nurses and frontline staff have been lost while £3billion has been wasted on a reckless NHS reorganisation, putting patient safety at risk. ‘Labour will invest an extra £2.5billion to recruit 20,000 more nurses – investment the Tories will not match.’","It is estimated around one in 20 patients are harmed every year in hospital .

"From organising protests in oppressed countries to sharing viral videos and jokes: People use Twitter to share pretty much everything. And now the Californian company has given $10 million to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to study exactly how the public uses Twitter to achieve different shared goals. It is hoped that the research will help experts understand how messages spread online and the origins of rumours and ideas. Twitter has given $10 million to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to study exactly how the public uses Twitter to achieve different shared goals. A screen shot of the popular website is pictured . Over the next five years, the university's researchers will analyse a vast quantity of content from Twitter, Reddit and other online forums to build new communication tools that journalists, policy experts and researchers can use to uncover new patterns and trends. The new MIT lab is called the Laboratory of Social Machines. Scientists will access data from Gnip, a Twitter-owned website that stores a vast database of historic tweets. It is hoped that the research will help experts understand how messages spread online and the origins of rumours and ideas. Here, a group of protestors share videos and news to social media sites in New York City . Twitter is keen to better understand its users and has previously awarded smaller sums of funding to academic institutions in a programme known as Twitter Data Grants. But the MIT grant is significant due to its size and scope. There is an ‘openendness’ to the research, said Deb Roy, an associate professor at MIT's Media Lab. He said that he has a close relationship with Twitter, in part because his former company Bluefin Labs was acquired by the San Francisco-based company in 2013. ‘Twitter has a special role to play in this concept of social change,’ Professor Roy said.

"A woman who tried to shoplift $11 worth of frozen food from Walmart allegedly threatened to infect an employee with HIV. Diamond Lawrence, 25, attempted to walk out of the Forest Lane Walmart in Dallas with the food when she was confronted by the employee. According to NBC DFW, as Lawrence was escorted to the back of the store, she said: 'I can infect whomever I please.' Arrested: Diamond Lawrence, 25, scratched the neck of an employee at the Dallas store in a deliberate attempt to draw blood and expose him to HIV after she was caught shoplifting . She then reportedly struck the sales associated in the face and scratched his neck in what they believe was a deliberate attempt to draw blood and expose him to the virus. Records state Lawrence told the employee repeatedly 'you're welcome' after the attack. Officers said she was wearing a medical wristband that identified her as having HIV. The employee was checked out by Dallas-Fire Rescue crews, but no known bodily fluid was exchanged. Wal-Mart doesn't prosecute for shoplifting the amount of small items, but asked Lawrence to never return to the store. However, she had two outstanding arrest warrants for public intoxication and an invalid driver's license. Lawrence is in the Dallas County Jail. Her bail is set at $1,500.

"Dramatic footage of confiscated motorcycles and quad bikes has been released to warn drivers to be responsible on the roads. The Quad Squad was set up by West Yorkshire Police in July to crack down on the number of dangerous drivers. In just two months the group has seized almost 80 quads and motorbikes which have all been crushed in a bid to deter motorists from driving irresponsibly. Scroll down for video . Footage of dozens of motorbikes and quad bikes before they are destroyed has been released by the Quad Squad . The squad -set up by Yorkshire Police to tackle dangerous driving - has already seized 77 bikes since July . Vehicles that aren't claimed by owners are taken to a dismantling site and sorted into categories two categories - salvage or scrap. Those that are to be destroyed are dropped in a large hydraulic compacting machine which reduces the bikes - worth thousands of pounds - to a square hunk of metal and plastic. Another machine chews up wiring looms to produce child-friendly plastic, while bikes that are salvaged are sold on. Plans to donate some bikes to charities which work with young people who ride off road legitimately are being discussed. PC David Hitchcocks, of the Bike Team, said: 'Hopefully, this video should serve as a warning to those who make their neighbours’ lives a misery with noise nuisance or put their own enjoyment before the safety of other road users. Among the vehicles some were destroyed into cubes of metal and plastic while others are sold on .

'It doesn’t matter if your vehicle is worth £50 or £3,000 - it will still end up as a cube of scrap metal if it is suspected of being used irresponsibly.' Sergeant Jonathan Best, who leads the team based in Bradford, West Yorkshire, added: 'We will continue to tackle nuisance riders across the district, and we urge people to keep reporting incidents and any details of the bikes which are being used to the police.

"Play for England at the World Cup? I need to learn how to play union first! I hung up on Gladiator Russell Crowe the first time he called . I lived in an apartment owned by Russell Crowe and went to the beach every day... My time in Australia was a dream . My father's death made me stronger... He was my hero and I know he'd be proud . When Sam Burgess makes his debut for Bath on Friday night at The Rec, it will actually be the cross-code sensation’s second game of union. The first didn’t go well. As a league-mad teenager, he had shown no inclination to try his hand at the 15-man game, but after being talked into it, the experiment was short-lived. ‘I was about 14 and I went to Old Brodleians, near Cleckheaton,’ he said. ‘I trained with them for a bit and had one game, because a couple of my mates from school were playing for them. I played fly-half. It was a cold, rubbish day and I just didn’t enjoy it. I didn’t get the ball very much and I was happy to stick with league.’ Bath's new signing Sam Burgess is set to make his debut on Friday night against Harlequins . Fascination with the oval ball gripped Burgess from an early age. ‘I used to sleep with a rugby ball in my arms,’ he said. ‘I was obsessed.’ Yet, as was the case with union, his first match in league - at age five - did more to put him off than entice him. ‘I’ll never forget it,’ he said. ‘I was given the ball and I got tackled straight into a big puddle. It was freezing, I ran off crying and didn’t play again for a year.’ The first time Burgess played Rugby Union as a 14-year-old he did not enjoy it . As one of four brothers, Burgess would play in the back yard at home in West Yorkshire, with Luke -eldest of the siblings - and younger twins George and Tom. Their father, Mark, had played and eventually coached the boys at Dewsbury Moor, while mum Julie also inspired him by going from playing touch rugby to taking up the sport competitively at weekends. Thomas Burgess, George Burgess, mum Julie Burgess, Luke Burgess and Sam  pose after a game in Sydney . Burgess has signed up as one of Sportsmail's rugby union columnists . Sam also had his league idols, one of whom is now an England coach in union. ‘Andy Farrell, Adrian Morley and Jamie Peacock were my heroes,’ he said. ‘If I had to say one, it was Faz. I wasn’t a Wigan fan, but I just thought he was an amazing player. I’ll never forget the first time I saw him, as a kid. I was in a lift at the JJB Stadium, the doors opened and he walked in.

'We have a few days to work on it but with the type of injury it is I will need to make 100 per cent sure whether I'm fit or not. 'I'll take advice from the medical staff but it's a game I'm desperate to play in. It's a game I've always enjoyed and one you look forward to.

"For the past year, he has been dubbed the 'most hated free man in America'. Now, George Zimmerman's family have told of life following their relative's fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida, in 2012 and subsequent acquittal last summer. It involves endless days of paranoia, safe house re-locations and get-rich-quick schemes, as well as 'lots and lots' of guns. It even features the use of a color-coded threat ID system: Code Blue (there is law enforcement at the door), Code Brown (draw your weapons), and Code Black (come out guns blazing). Acquitted: George Zimmerman, pictured at court in 2013, fatally shot 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida, on February 26, 2012. He was acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter last summer . Zimmerman's parents, Gladys and Bob, and younger brother Robert spoke to GQ about their new life with the killer, who was acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter last summer. The family, who describe themselves as 'victims', said they already owned at least ten guns before Zimmerman  shot to death the unarmed 17-year-old on February 26, 2012. But they said as soon as his younger sister Grace saw the news report on her phone, she screamed, 'We need to get guns!', before buying a new Taurus pistol. As  violent threats flooded in and a $10,000 bounty was placed for Zimmerman's 'citizen's arrest', the family then decided they could no longer stay put. Zimmerman, who was not charged with murder until six weeks after the shooting, and his then-wife Shellie went to stay with a federal air marshal friend, while the rest of the family fled to Florida. Robert, who bears a strong resemblance to his brother, was living in suburban Washington D.C. at the time and was seen as especially vulnerable. Parents: Zimmerman's family, including his mother Gladys and father Bob (pictured), have opened up on life following the shooting. It involves endless days of paranoia, safe house re-locations and  'lots' of guns . Hopes: Robert Zimmerman Jr (pictured), who bears a strong resemblance to his brother, reportedly wanted to capitalize on Zimmerman's notoriety by turning him into a reality TV star, like Kim Kardashian . Following the shooting, a special agent from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement reportedly told him he had been identified as a target, saying: 'You need to go, and you need to go now.' The family still live in a safe house in central Florida, where they rarely go out or see Zimmerman, fearing an attack from the public as payback for Mr Martin's killing. 'I am sure there are people, you know, some young kid that has nothing going for him, but he's able to get a pistol, wants to make a name for himself,' Bob, who often sleeps with a gun, told GQ. 'Maybe I'll kill one of the Zimmermans. Maybe George, maybe one of his family members. I'll be famous.' You know? That happens. And that's what worries me.' Court: The Zimmermans, who describe themselves as 'victims', said they already owned at least ten guns before their relative shot to death Mr Martin. Above, George Zimmerman and his then-wife Shellie in court . Victim: Trayvon Martin was shot by Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch coordinator, on February 26, 2012 . As well as living in fear, the family are reportedly battling financial issues, having spent around $35,000 on hotel rooms and safe houses, and Zimmerman owing $2.5million in legal fees. Due to his notoriety, Zimmerman remains unemployed and reluctant to find a job, according to the magazine article, which is published in GQ's October edition. 'When your name, Social Security number, and everything is out on the Internet, it's hard to do anything,' said Bob. Robert, who believes his 30-year-old brother is suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, has come up with a number of get-rich-quick schemes over the past two years. His ultimate aim was reportedly to capitalize on Zimmerman's notoriety by turning him into a reality TV star - like other celebrities have done in the past. He cited John Walsh, who began hosting America's Most Wanted after his young son was abducted and killed, and Kim Kardashian, whose leaked sex tape propelled her to fame, as examples. Since his acquittal, Zimmerman, who claimed he shot Mr Martin's in self defense, has faced several allegations of violence, including one by his ex-wife, who divorced him just weeks after the verdict. Hidden: Zimmerman's parents, Gladys and Bob (pictured), are still living in a safe house in central Florida . Angry: Following the shooting, the New Black Panther Party (pictured) put  a $10,000 bounty on Zimmerman . Bob said the former neighborhood watch co-ordinator's biggest fear is that he will now be charged with federal civil rights violations for killing Mr Martin. 'He's worried,' he said. 'That if FBI agents come and kick in his door, he's probably gonna shoot a few of them.' There is an ongoing federal investigation into Zimmerman’s case.","George Zimmerman fatally shot Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida, in 2012 .

I lived in an apartment owned by Russell Crowe and went to the beach every day... My time in Australia was a dream . Just as Sam Burgess’s rugby league career was about to take off with Bradford, he was forced to come to terms with the devastating news that his dad had been diagnosed with Motor Neurone disease. Sam was 15 when his parents sat the brothers down in the conservatory at home and Mark revealed he was seriously ill. Sam had never seen him cry, so his father’s emotion that day had a profound impact. ‘Me and my older brother went off and did some research on it,’ he said. ‘We realised then that it was really serious but, as a kid of that age, I still didn’t really understand it. I didn’t know how quick it would all happen. I just figured that as time went by, he would be all right; he’d overcome it. Sam Burgess' father Mark (above) was diagnosed with Motor Neurone disease when the rugby star was 15 . Burgess lived with his father during the illness while his three brothers live with mother Julie . ‘I never believed he was going to die. I thought it was a myth. I thought that people can survive cancer, so my dad would survive that. My dad was my hero so I thought he would be able to beat it, but it moved fast. It’s a terrible disease. It’s an awful thing. ‘It was happening at about the time my senior career with Bradford was starting and it was literally about 18 months to two years from when they told us the news to when he passed. It went so fast.’ While the other three brothers lived with their mum, Sam lived with his dad and nursed him through the last stage of his life — carrying him upstairs to bed each night. With his modest wages, he had to pay the mortgage and the bills. Burgess had to deal with the death of his father during the early days of his Bradford career . Burgess tackles Leeds' Ryan Bailey during a Super League match in 2007 . That episode made him grow up fast. ‘I didn’t know anything else, so I didn’t feel that looking after my dad was a burden,’ he said. ‘I actually enjoyed it. It sounds strange, but we made the most of that time. ‘Going through that helped me become better at a lot of things. I learned not to take things for granted. It has made me stronger but colder, too, in a way. ‘My dad is in my thoughts every day. It was a tough part of life, but also a great part.

"The move to Australia which catapulted Burgess into the pantheon of rugby league greats was a case of an on-field warrior being lured by an on-screen Gladiator. In 2008, Sam was ruled out of England selection due to injury, so he, Luke and three friends spent five weeks backpacking Down Under. He caught the bug and upon returning home, informed Bradford of his desire to move to the other side of the world, to play in the NRL. His life changed when he received a call from the owner of South Sydney Rabbitohs — a certain Russell Crowe. Rabbitohs owner Russell Crowe celebrates the grand final victory with Sam Burgess, who he lured to the club . Crowe (left) hugs Burgess (right) after the club's first premiership win in 43 years . ‘Midway through the 2009 season I was desperate to go to Australia,’ said Sam. ‘I got this call off a private number and it turned out to be Russell. As I’ve said before, I thought it was a prank call and hung up! ‘At that stage, no-one from South Sydney had called me, so the first call I got from them was from Russell Crowe. It was surreal! ‘I had watched Gladiator and it’s a mega film. I knew exactly who he was. I went to meet him two weeks later where he was filming, in Derby. For that first meeting, I went down with four or five of my mates. There were about 10 of us sitting around a big table at the hotel he was staying in. We had a feed and a few beers. Burgess won man of the match after suffering facial fractures in the opening minute of the match . The 25-year-old was given a hero's reception by fans at Redfern Oval after the Grand Final victory . ‘The next day he asked me to come over and meet him again, where he was filming. My mum came down as well. We sat in his trailer for three-and-a-half hours, drank coffee and chatted. We spoke about what I went through with my dad, about my family and what I wanted to do in Australia.’ The player whom Crowe would go on to acclaim as the ‘sparkly-eyed man’ earned a contract with the Rabbitohs and the actor served as his tour guide when he made the move. ‘For the first week or two I spent every day with him,’ said Burgess. ‘We would get on bikes and cycle all around Sydney. I would finish training at 1.30pm, meet Russell at 2.30 and we’d ride for 30km around town — every single day. I was absolutely knackered, but I couldn’t say no! It was a great experience. ‘We’re so close now; we talk about really personal stuff. He’s a friend for life.’ Burgess revealed he thinks Crowe's Gladiator blockbuster is a 'mega film' Julie Burgess poses with her Rabbitohs sons (from left) Sam, Luke, George and Tom .

The young goalkeeper (centre) is congratulated by Newcastle No 2 John Carver at full-time against Chelsea . Alnwick is 'very lucky' to have Alan Pardew as a boss, insists Newcastle goalkeeping coach Andy Woodman . 'Jak's an incredibly mature young man. You wouldn't think he's just 21 talking to him or indeed watching him play out there,' Woodman said. 'I wouldn't have any worries about Jak because there is this calmness and assurance about him, and I think against Chelsea his team-mates saw that and it gave them confidence. 'He's like a lot of young English players, bags of talent and good character but it's all about getting the chance and as a goalkeeper, it's even harder to be given that chance. 'We're very lucky here at Newcastle to have a manager who plays young footballers. In circumstances you do not always want, like [against Chelsea] with Rob having to come off, Jak has done his own prospects no harm at all.'

"Aaron Ramsey scored one of the goals of the season as Arsenal answered their critics with a 4-1 win at Galatasaray, but boss Arsene Wenger is now focusing on improving their domestic form. The 23-year-old's sensational 30-yard half-volley - which was so good it was applauded by the home fans and started debates about great goals on social media - made it 3-0 after half an hour as the Gunners put in a commanding display in Istanbul, showing no hangover from the disappointment of Saturday's 3-2 defeat at Stoke. A lot of the reaction on Twitter focused on Arsenal forward Yaya Sanogo, who just looked flabbergasted after Ramsey's strike went in. Aaron Ramsey celebrates after scoring his second goal of the night against Galatasaray . Sanogo looked on astonished after Ramsey smashed home a 30-yarder against the Turkish side . Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny holds his head in his hands in disbelief after watching the strike . He was very modest in his reaction to his wonder strike after the match, saying: 'The ball came to the edge of the box and I thought, 'why not have a go? 'So I had a go and it went in.' It was the Wales midfielder's second goal of the match, with Lukas Podolski also scoring twice for the visitors, while Wesley Sneijder clipped home a late 20-yard free-kick as a small consolation for Galatasaray. The win was a big one for Wenger after he was jeered and subjected to some aggressive personal abuse as the players boarded the train back to London at Stoke after losing at the weekend. The 65-year-old now has his eyes firmly fixed on remedying their stuttering Premier League form while they wait to find out who they will face in the last 16 of the Champions League next year. VIDEO Watch Yaya Sanogo's reaction to Aaron Ramsey's super strike . Dortmund's draw against Anderlecht, however, means Arsenal finished second in Group D and so could face the likes of Real Madrid, Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain or defending champions Bayern Munich when the pairings are made on Monday. By then, though, Wenger believes Arsenal could themselves be a very different prospect, with several key players set to return from injury in the coming weeks. 'Let's wait for the draw, prepare well. We can focus now on the Premier League,' said Wenger. 'It was my 180th game in Champions League on Tuesday night, we won away from home and now 15 consecutive years in the last 16. That, I believe, is an achievement. 'So let's focus on the Premier League until the end of February and the FA Cup as well, after then we will see where we stand.' The French coach was pleased with the 'strong response' shown by his team. 'We looked dangerous every time we won the ball back, we had good penetration, we scored good goals and until half-time I feel we were very strong,' he said. '(In the) second half we suffered a bit more for two reasons - some players had not enough competitive games and especially I had to take two players off. 'We were a bit more lightweight in the second half in midfield. 'We were closer to conceding one or two more in the second half and we defended very well. 'We still had our opportunities but some decisions around the box went against us in the second half, but we tried and overall, it was a strong performance.' Both Ramsey and Mathieu Flamini were taken off at the break with minor muscle problems, but are expected to be available for Saturday's late afternoon kick-off against Newcastle at the Emirates Stadium.","Arsenal beat Galatasaray 4-1 in the Champions League .

"Play for England at the World Cup? I need to learn how to play union first . I hung up on Gladiator Russell Crowe the first time he called . I cried off after my debut as a fly-half ended in tears . I lived in an apartment owned by Russell Crowe and went to the beach every day... My time in Australia was a dream . For Burgess, life as a Pom playing in Australia is the fantasy which came true. From the moment he flew out there on his 21st birthday, he revelled in his new environment. ‘I’d gone from West Yorkshire to Sydney; this great city, where it was red hot, I was going to the beach every day, playing golf four times a week and playing professional rugby league. I was living my dream,’ he said. ‘I lived in this apartment — Russell Crowe owned it — which looked out over the harbour bridge and the opera house. I used to go back after training, lie down on the day-bed on my balcony and fall asleep.’ Sam Burgess reveals his loved every minute of being an Englishman playing in Australia . Burgess fractured his cheekbone a minute into the NRL final in October, but played on to the end of the game . He soon made his mark on the elite rugby league scene Down Under and was quite surprised that he did not receive more stick for being an exiled Englishman. In fact, when his three brothers all ended up joining him at the Rabbitohs, the Burgess boys were made to feel right at home. ‘The Souths people really embraced the English, especially when we were all there,’ he said. ‘They used to do a Union Jack in red and green — the team colours. They could see that we were patriotic. We even had Union Jack speedos! I would love to have played in State of Origin, but that would have meant giving up my England jersey and that’s something I could never have done.’ Burgess breaks down after a try in the closing stages of the match as his achievement sunk in . Burgess revealed his apologised to his mum Julie (right) for playing on with a fracture cheekbone . Once Burgess decided to cross codes, his final season in NRL became a quest to help his club win their first title in 43 years. Fired by a sense of destiny, he played the whole Grand Final last month in agony after fracturing his cheekbone and eye socket in a first-minute clash of heads with compatriot James Graham. ‘I wasn’t even meant to be there,’ he said. ‘Three or four minutes before kick-off, the coach asked me to swap positions, then the ball came straight to me in the first play and I collided with James. I knew I couldn’t come off, but there was blood coming down the back of my throat and I was choking on it. Julie Burgess poses with her Rabbitohs sons (from left) Sam, Luke, George and Tom . ‘We got to half time and as I walked down the tunnel, my girlfriend, her family and my mum were all there. I looked up and saw that they were so worried, so I just shook my head and said “I’m sorry”. My girlfriend told me later that she was saying, “It’s alright, just keep playing” but I didn’t see that at the time.’ Burgess did just that and etched his name into NRL folklore with victory. ‘I played 97 games for South Sydney and I would love to play 100 games for them,’ he said. ‘Never say never.’ Sam Burgess is a Canterbury ambassador for rugby and training products.

"While many people might enjoy looking out at a storm while huddled up inside their house, farmer Anne-Marie Cotterell is not one of them. That's because the 40-year-old has a herd of 340 cattle to protect, and worries that they could be killed if they are hit by lightning. So when she checked on the animals after a recent storm and found them all safe and well, she celebrated the occasion by taking a selfie with one of her favourites.

"Jak Alnwick will make his first start at St James’ Park in the Tyne-Wear derby – and the rookie goalkeeper is being backed to take his chance and win a new contract. Newcastle – without senior goalkeepers Tim Krul and Rob Elliot until January because of injury – will not be allowed by the Premier League to bring in a replacement stopper on an emergency-loan deal. Manager Alan Pardew, however, was always minded to give Alnwick a run in the team after his performance during the second half of Saturday’s 2-1 victory over Chelsea.

Andy Woodman is the Newcastle goalkeeping coach who works with Alnwick on a daily basis, and he believes the young custodian will not be fazed by the step up to senior level. ‘Jak’s an incredibly mature young man,’ said Woodman, whose 17-year-old son, Freddie, will now take his place on the bench as back-up to Alnwick.

In fact, he’ll relish it.’ Alnwick’s long-term future is complicated by the signing of Nottingham Forest goalkeeper Karl Darlow, who has remained at the City Ground on loan this season.

"Gough Whitlam’s iconic 1972 campaign song, ‘It’s Time’ captured the nation's attention to lead the Australian Labor Party to victory, despite not mentioning the words ‘Labor, ‘Gough’ or ‘Whitlam’ once. And 42 years later, the ALP anthem remains one of the most successful and innovative campaign strategies in Australian politics. Former prime minister Gough Whitlam, the reformist Labor leader who was famously dismissed from his post in 1975, died aged 98. Tributes to the late leader frequently mention the historical, simple slogan, 'It's Time' as it has become synonymous with Whitlam's legacy. The anthem of the same title was an important moment for both Australian politics and for the arts. Scroll down for video . Gough Whitlam's 'It's Time' campaign was one of the most effective in Australia's history, remembered for its iconic campaign song . The song was performed by a star-studded line up of Australian singers, actors, sport star and other media personalities. 'It's Time' was led by soul singer Alison McCallum (pictured) Australian singer Little Patti (right) was one of the singers who became involved with Gough Whitlam's 'It's Time' campaign, singing on his campaign jingle . The stirring anthem paved the way for future political campaigns by recruiting some of Australia’s most treasured musicians, actors and entertainment identities to perform the song – a tactic which was largely unheard of at the time. Jacki Weaver, Jack Thompson, Bert Newton and Barry Crocker were just a few of the group of Aussie stars who lent their support to the ALP party, recording the song and appearing in the clip, led by soul singer Alison McCallum. One of the celebrities involved was Australian singer “Little Pattie"" also known as Patricia Amplett, who revealed what it was like to be involved in such a huge moment in history. It’s time for freedom, It’s time for moving, It’s time to begin, Yes It’s time . It’s time Australia, It’s time for moving, It’s time for proving, Yes It’s time .

Time to move on, Time to stand up, time to say ‘yes’, Yes It’s time . ‘The ''It's Time'' commercial was far more effective than anyone could have imagined,’ Ms Amphlett told SMH in 2012. ‘Long before Live Aid, it came as a shock to some people that popular personalities would stand up publicly and be counted for a cause.’ Photos from Gough Whitlam's personal collection were used in the clip in the hope of helping the public relate to Gough. The campaign strategists wanted him to seem more warm and personable . The song used Labor’s now famed slogan ‘It’s time’ to create an jingle as part of a television campaign, calling Australians to action and energising them for an ‘era of change’. Pre-campaign research had found that Gough Whitlam needed to be ‘humanised’ for the Australian public, so he seemed warmer, more personable and relatable for the Australian public. Researchers were also told that his wife, Margaret Whitlam, was not seen enough by the public. Jacki Weaver, Jack Thompson, Bert Newton and Barry Crocker were part of the large group of Aussie stars who recorded the song and appeared in the clip for the ALP . The concept was created by Paul Jones and Mike Shirley, who planned the song, the performers and candid images of Whitlam. These photographs are the only mentions of the party in the clip – the song is entirely delivered by familiar faces and Australian citizens. They decided to use photos from the Labor party leader’s personal collection, showing him with his family and at work throughout the video. The song was recorded by the throng of personalities at Hordern Pavillion in Sydney’s east, where the atmosphere was 'electric' The song was recorded by the throng of personalities at Hordern Pavillion in Sydney’s east. According to Ms Amphlett, the atmosphere was ‘electric.’ The song aimed to reach out to a society, promising that change was imminent. At the time, Australia was at war with Vietnam and facing a string of issues, such as women’s rights, Indigenous injustices and the high costs of education and healthcare. The song was a hit, launched on the night of Whitlam's famed policy launch, when he made a stirring speech in Sydney's west. The speech and song were coordinated to capture the attention and raise the hopes of Australians. 'I do not for a moment believe that we should set limits on what we can achieve, together, for our country, our people, our future,' Whitlam said during the pre-election speech in Bankstown. Similarly, the song urged Australians to move, look ahead and begin. Whitlam led the Labor Party roaring back to power after 23 years in the political wilderness. It abolished the last remnants of the White Australia Policy, established relations with China, recognised Indigenous land rights, created Medibank, scrapped tertiary education fees and reduced the voting age to 18. After three years in office, Whitlam was historically dismissed by Governor-General John Kerr on November 11, 1975.

"Manchester United attacking midfielder Juan Mata can feel momentum building at Old Trafford and is hopeful the side's winning run can continue throughout a busy December. Mata got on the scoresheet as United continued their recent revival after an indifferent start to the campaign, and in spite of a lengthy injury list, by overcoming Stoke 2-1 on Tuesday. The victory was United's fourth in succession in the Barclays Premier League and maintained their position in the top four. Juan Mata (right) has called on his team-mates to build on their recent Premier League wins . Spanish international Mata scored what turned out to be the winning goal against Stoke . Marcos Rojo claimed he got a touch on the Spaniard's cross, however Mata has been awarded the goal . The second win in that sequence was a hard-fought 2-0 success at Arsenal and Mata feels things have started to build from there. 'It was very important to win at Arsenal and then to get two wins in a row at home,' said Mata, also looking back to Saturday's convincing 3-0 defeat of Hull. 'Now we have the chance to have a great December - probably the most important month in the league because we play more (games).' The Stoke clash was actually United's first home night game of the season, a notable fixture quirk that also highlights their lack of European football this term. The gap between fixtures shrinks now, though, with six more games to be played up to and including New Year's Day. United will be tested at third-placed Southampton next Monday and then by Liverpool the following weekend, but Mata believes the team spirit, much maligned last season, is now starting to shine through. The 26-year-old Spaniard said: 'The spirit is there. We have not been lucky with injuries, we've had important players that could not play, but the spirit is there. 'Everyone was very happy in the dressing room after the game because it was a difficult game and we showed character.' United went ahead against the Potters as Marouane Fellaini continued his recent good spell of form by heading home midway through the first half. Marouane Fellaini rises unchallenged to give Manchester United the lead against Stoke . Fellaini celebrates putting United a goal up after 21 minutes at Old Trafford as Asmir Begovic sits on the turf . Stoke responded with a fine strike from Steven Nzonzi, but United claimed a decisive lead when Mata's 59th-minute free-kick from the right appeared to bounce straight in, although Marcos Rojo claimed to have got a touch. United had the better of the play, but their performance was still not entirely convincing and Stoke three times went close to snatching an equaliser in a breathless injury-time spell. First David de Gea produced a brilliant reflex save to keep out a Mame Biram Diouf header. He then denied Marko Arnautovic from point-blank range and the rebound attempt from Diouf was hacked off the line by Ashley Young. The goal decision system showed the ball was roughly two thirds over the line before Young cleared or, as Stoke boss Mark Hughes put it, a 'hair's breadth' away from going in. Mata said: 'It was very tough and we were, until the last minute, suffering. They played good in their way. They came here as a very compact team and they play good counter-attacks. Ashley Young cleared the ball off the line in the closing stages of Manchester United's win against Stoke . Young was delighted that goal-line technology allowed referee Jonathan Moss to make the correct decision . 'At the end, it's a very important win, a fourth win in a row and we are getting closer.' It was the second time in two games United had seen the benefits of goal-line technology, with defender Chris Smalling awarded a goal in another close call on Saturday. Young said: 'The referee was there with his watch and as soon as the ball hit my foot and was cleared off the line I looked to see if he was whistling for a goal. 'He wasn't and we managed to hold on to the win, so thank God for goal-line technology.' Nzonzi was at a loss to explain how he ended up on the losing side after such a frantic ending. The Frenchman, who found the net with a powerful drive from 20 yards, told the Potters' website, www.stokecityfc.com: 'We're very unlucky. I don't know what to say. 'In the second half they played better, but we had some good chances a the end of the game. I don't know how we didn't score them. It's crazy. They have a really good goalkeeper, but it's unlucky. 'It's really disappointing. We could have come here and got a point but we lost. We are going to have to work really hard on Saturday against Arsenal.'

"When Czech artist Jakub Hadrava was asked to help transform a dilapidated village church, he knew he would have his work cut out. Thankfully he came up with a frightfully good idea. Mr Hadrava has helped secure the future of the 14th century St George's church in Lukova after creating a spooky art installation that features a collection of hooded 'ghosts' that line the pews and aisles. Czech artist Jakub Hadrava was commissioned to create artwork that would attract visitors to St George's church in Lukova . Since his work was added to the medieval building over the summer, the church has seen a huge influx of tourists from counties as far away as Brazil, Australia and Germany. The thousands of visitors who have turned up have now left behind enough money to get much needed repair work done to the church. The church, which is in the north-western Bohemia region of the Czech Republic, had initially fallen into disrepair in 1968 after the roof collapsed during a funeral service. The ghosts are made out of plaster and fill the pews and the aisle of the church which was built in 1352 . Hadrava said the figures represent the ghosts of Sudeten Germans who lived in Lukova before World War Two and who came to pray at this church every Sunday . Convinced that this was an omen, locals in the area abandoned it, preferring to carry out sermons and masses outside. But after four decades local artist Mr Hadrava was brought in to attract visitors and investment. Renovation work has now started and local council officials are confident the church's future is now secure. Jakub said: 'I wanted to make the church more attractive for visitors and try to raise some money for renovation work. The 14th century St George's church in the village of Lukova in north-western Bohemia in the Czech Republic had fallen into disrepair after the roof collapsed during a funeral service in 1968 . 'The figures represent the ghosts of Sudeten Germans who lived in Lukova before World War Two and who came to pray at this church every Sunday. 'I hope to show the world that this place had a past and it was a normal part of everyday life, but that fate has a huge influence on our lives.' The ghosts are made out of plaster and fill the pews and the aisle of the church, which was built in 1352. Convinced the church was cursed, locals abandoned it preferring to carry out sermons and masses outside . Hadrava's instalation is now drawing in crowds from all over the world, raising funds for the church's repair . The church manager said the attraction was proving popular with visitors from Germany and the UK . Voluntary church manager Petr Koukl, 59, said: 'Foreigners are particularly interested in the church and there have been many visitors from Germany, the UK, Australia and even Brazil. 'It is a beautiful building with original pillars from the 14th century. 'Unfortunately, many things have over the years being stolen. 'But the money we make from visitors is allowing us to eventually restore the church to what it once was.' Local Radomir Sedlacek, 59, said: 'It's certainly hair-raising, let's hope it will continue to be cash-raising too.'","St George's church in the Czech Republic fell into disrepair in 1960s .

"Zlatan Ibrahimovic told his team-mates they would struggle without him as he left Inter Milan for Barcelona. However, they took no notice of his harsh words.

The Serie A side were training in the United States when the news came through that one of their star strikers was leaving. Moratti told Corriere della Sera: 'He was getting on a plane to Barcelona to sign for Barca after the last training with the team and he said: 'It has been nice playing with you but you won't win anything without me.' The 69-year-old admits he still looks back at Ibrahimovic's time with club, where he won three consecutive Serie A titles, with fond memories.

"The husband of Teresa Romero, the Spanish nurse who survived Ebola says his wife is heartbroken that authorities killed their dog Excalibur while she was in the hospital. Ms Romero, 44, went into isolation on October 6 after caring for two infected priests at Carlos III Hospital in central Madrid. She is now questioning why her beloved pet was put down when it was not to blame for her contracting Ebola. Scroll down for video . Saved: Teresa Romero, 44, has tested negative for Ebola weeks after contracting the disease, the Spanish government said. But her dog Excalibur (pictured) was put down as a precaution, sparking a national outcry . Innocent animal: Ms Romero's husband Javier Limon Romero (pictured with their dog) his wife is heartbroken that authorities killed Excalibur . 'She is asking herself why they killed the dog, who wasn't to blame for anything,' her husband Javier Limon told Spanish newspaper El Pais. Spanish officials had said the dog was a possible risk for transmitting the deadly virus. In the United States, the dog of a nurse infected with Ebola was quarantined and tested negative. Ms Romero's case blew up into mass protests when Excalibur was put down despite it being unclear whether the pet had the virus. Thousands of angry protesters marched in the streets of Madrid calling on the government's health minister Ana Mato to resign after the pet's death on October 8. Ms Romero's recovery could prompt further criticism by the protesters, 390,000 of whom signed a petition urging officials to save Excalibur's life. Protest: Thousands of protesters in Madrid including health workers have called on the health minister  to resign after Excalibur was euthanized . Animal anger: One activist's dog wore a sign which said Excalibur's death could not be forgotten or forgiven . Innocent: Some 390,000 animal rights activists and protesters called for Excalibur (pictured) to be spared . Death row: Excalibur barking on Ms Romero's Madrid balcony before the pet was put down by the authorities . Although Ms Romero's recovery would not have changed the odds of Excalibur contracting the disease, protesters had insisted the animal could have been cared for safely in quarantine. U.S. officials took just that tack when they announced they would be saving Bentley, the spaniel belonging to Ebola patient Nina Pham in Dallas, Texas. This week Ms Romero tested negative for the disease, the government said in a statement. Further tests will be carried out tonight to confirm the result, as patients must be re-tested within 72 hours. The nurse cared for Spanish missionary Manuel Garcia Viejo, 69, who died on September 25 after being infected with Ebola while he treated patients in Sierra Leone. Another Spanish priest, 75-year-old Miguel Pajares, had died in Madrid in August after being flown back from missionary work in Liberia. Ms Romero was treated with a drip of human serum containing antibodies from Ebola sufferers who had survived the disease, and other drugs which a government spokesman declined to name. One was the experimental anti-viral medicine favipiravir, according to the respected national newspaper El Mundo. Romero is the only known sufferer of Ebola in Spain after the death of the two priests.","Teresa Romero, 44, went into isolation after contact with infected missionary .

"A woman who has spent all her life being petrified of spiders finally overcame her fears today on live TV. Donna Rees had been terrified of the eight-legged creatures since the age of three - and admits she went to extreme lengths to avoid them. As well as nearly crashing her car after seeing a spider, she also dragged strangers into the house to remove them and ran into the street in her nightwear after discovering one. Donna Rees had been terrified of spiders all her life until today - but thanks to celebrity psychotherapists Nik and Eva Speakman, she is now fine . In the space of an hour, Mrs Rees went from barely being able to look at a spider to holding  one . She told ITV's This Morning: 'The phobia has affected my whole life.' But today, the curse was finally lifted after she received therapy on the show. Thanks to the help of celebrity psychotherapists Nik and Eva Speakman, Mrs Rees went from barely being able to look at a spider to holding a huge tarantula. The couple say their unique brand of therapy encourages people to confront patterns or beliefs set in their childhoods. Indeed, Mrs Rees explained her phobia began at the age of three, when she woke from a nightmare. 'I came out of the bedroom and my grandma was there, screaming at a big spider on the wall. 'The stage was set from then - and I have feared them my whole life.' When asked by presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden how she felt physically when she saw a spider, she said: 'Things go into slow motion. It's real fear, like someone is stood there with a knife or a gun. 'I need to run and get away - I have heart palpitations, my heart is beating with sheer panic.' She added it took years for her to even say the word 'spider'. Before she was cured, Donna nearly crashed her car after seeing a spider, dragged strangers into the house to remove them and ran into the street in her nightwear after discovering one . 'I could never deal with one in the house - I check clothes before I put them on, and I'm always afraid to sit on the floor. 'When my husband Kev is on nights, rather than get home and do the things I want to do, I go straight to bed, wrap myself in a sheet and turn the lights out. 'I know it's ridiculous but couldn't bear it if I saw one in the house.' She has even swerved into oncoming traffic after noticing a spider in the car. 'It was lucky it was night time,' she recalled. 'There was a petrol tanker coming towards me - had it not had its lights on, I may not have seen it and swerved out of the way in time. 'Another time I ran out of my house in my nightdress, stopped a complete stranger in a car and dragged him in the house to come and get rid of the spider. 'I looked like a complete lunatic.' Before the show, Donna sat with the Speakmans, who tested just how terrified she was of spiders by wiring her up to a heart monitor and showing her images. At the beginning of the session, her heart rate was 92 . But after being shown two pictures of a spider, her heart rate shot up to 145 and she became tearful . Nik and Eva Speakman are celebrity psychotherapists who made their fortune with a successful financial services company, before reinventing themselves as life coaches to the rich and famous. They say their goal is to ‘help people live a happier and more fulfilled life’ using their brand of therapy, in which they encourage people to confront patterns or beliefs developed in childhood. Nik and Eva Speakman are celebrity psychotherapists . Their curious treatments include seating patients in the back of a vintage DeLorean sports car, so that they can travel 'back to the future' to confront past demons. ‘If you weren’t born with an issue, you can change a behaviour for the better’, Eva Speakman says of the therapy. To help with a phobia, they identify the fear that has been blown out of proportion, and ‘re-programme’ so they understand they have made up the fear. Nik Speakman adds: ‘The big thing with a phobia is that it’s something that you’ve made up. ‘What we do is make people realise they’ve made it up, and we make something else up and take them back to where they were. Because no one is born with a phobia. ‘It’s a complete re-programming of the brain.’ Former Atomic Kitten singer Kerry Katona solicited their services, and they have also helped Coronation Street actress Kym Marsh, who credits the Speakmans' therapy with curing her phobia of motorway driving. Camelot has hired them to counsel National Lottery winners about how to deal with new-found wealth. More recently, they helped The Only Way Is Essex Star Sam Faiers get over a condition which saw her pull out her own eyelashes. Nik Speakman told the programme: 'No one is born with a phobia - it is a learned behaviour. 'In Donna's case, she had a nightmare, woke up, saw her nan screaming, looked at why and saw a spider. 'In that moment, she made the association.' Before the show, Donna sat with the Speakmans, who tested just how terrified she was of spiders. Despite declaring that on a scale of one to 10, she was a 10, they wanted to check scientifically by wiring her up to a heart monitor. At the beginning of the session, her heart rate was 92. But after being shown two pictures of a spider, her heart rate shot up to 135 and then 145. As a spider was brought out to her in a glass case, Donna began to look extremely uncomfortable and tearful. Shaking with fear, she admitted: 'I feel like crying. But I really want it [the problem] to stop.' However just 60 minutes later, Donna was back in the studio, appearing calm and composed. The Speakmans told an astounded Phillip and Amanda the secret had been changing the concept of a spider in Donna's head. They explained that as a young child, she had heard her grandmother scream and blamed the spider. 'But I now know it wasn't the spider's fault, it was Nan,' she said. 'She's the one who screamed with fear, I should have had a phobia of her. 'In the moment, I made the wrong choice - the spider didn't do anything.' She added she was grateful she had managed not to pass on her phobia to her son. As a test, she was then shown the pictures of the spiders again, while wired up to the heart rate monitor. This time, it remained a steady 97 beats per minute - even when the glass cabinet containing the spider was brought into the studio. Then, to everyone's astonishment, she put her hand in the cabinet and tried to fish the spider out with her fingers. She agreed that even an hour before, she wouldn't have dreamed such a situation to be possible. Laughing, she said: 'Normally by now, you would just see the back of me.' When asked if she was scared of the spider in her hands, she said: 'No, it's liberating, a miracle. 'My family won't believe it's me. They'll think ""it looks like Donna, but it can't be"".'","Donna Rees had been petrified of the creatures since the age of three .

"A disabled builder lived in a Scottish cave for five months after he was allegedly kicked out of his one-bedroom flat by a housing association. Cameron Logan, 50, and his partner Elaine survived in the 12ft deep rocky outcrop in Oban from May to September with just two sleeping bags to keep them warm. The former construction worker, who relies on crutches to walk, said living in the 15ft wide cave left him at his 'lowest ebb' as he struggled with the cold and wet conditions. Scroll down for video . A disabled builder and his partner, Elaine, lived in a Scottish cave for five months after he was kicked out of his one-bedroom flat . 'In this day and age, having to live in a cave is just not right. I'm amazed we survived,' he said. 'Two people don't deserve to have to live in a cave. It was only our love for one another that kept us going after everyone else let us down.' Mr Logan was a resident at Ross House homeless accommodation in Oban for more than two years prior to his ordeal. But after breaching the terms of his tenancy by offering Elaine - who herself was sleeping rough - shelter in his one-bedroom apartment, the pair were kicked out, according to Mr Logan. Cameron Logan, 50, who relies on crutches to walk, said living in the 15ft wide cave left him at his 'lowest ebb' as he struggled with the cold and wet conditions . The couple had just two sleeping bags to keep them warm and would spend their days looking for firewood . With no other home available, the only safe haven they could find was a cave off a popular dog-walking route overlooking Oban bay. 'I've always been from the area so I knew the cave was there,' said Mr Logan. 'It was all we had and our only option - the only place we could go if we hoped to survive. We slept in sleeping bags with our heads poking out of the front of the cave. 'We found some wooden panels which we used to sit on and we were given some rugs too, to keep us warm. 'But it was so uncomfortable. Just imagine yourself what it's like sleeping in a cave every night. 'As well as the problems I have with my legs, I've got depression too. 'Both were made so much worse by living in that cave and I found myself turning to alcohol more than ever before. Life in the cave left me at my lowest point.' The cave's walls were covered in insects and cobwebs with rainwater - which would blow in during the night - seeping in through cracks in its stone ceiling. Cameron said: 'We'd wake up every morning with the bells going at the church and go down to use their toilet. Sometimes my legs would be so bad though that I'd struggle to walk that far and just have to go in the trees beside the cave. Mr  Logan and his partner Elaine had to use public bathrooms to wash themselves and use the toilet . 'We had no showers and had to wash under the taps in the local public halls just to make ourselves clean. 'Nothing about it was hygienic. It was no way for a man and a woman to live.' The couple, who have now moved to Helensburgh, were helped by long-term friends Stephen Kelly and his partner Ashley McGuire, both 50. Mr Kelly said: 'Cammy would get stuck in the cave. His legs are degenerating so at times he struggles to move at all. 'There were times he couldn't even make it up the small incline to the cave, so would have to just sleep in the trees. 'We'd go and visit him first thing in the morning just to see that he was surviving.' The Blue Triangle Housing Association said that they do not comment on specific cases. A spokesman for Argyll and Bute Council said: 'There are many different reasons why people find themselves homeless. We would encourage anyone in this situation to come to our Homeless Service offices.'","Cameron Logan, 50, and his partner Elaine lived in a cave for five months .

"Scientists have known that hot water freezes faster than cold water, since the time of Aristotle in Ancient Greece. However, until now they have struggled to explain why. A team of scientists in Singapore believe they have finally revealed the mystery of the Mpemba effect and it lies in the unique properties of the bonds that hold water together. This graph shows how the Mpemba effect - how hot water freezes faster than cold. It shows how rapidly boiling water cools compared to the water that starts off at a lower temperature. Scientists think they have finally solved the mystery and believe the secret lies in the unique properties of the bonds that hold water together . The Mpemba effect is the theory that warmer water can freeze faster than colder water. The effect has been noted since ancient times but scientists have struggled to explain why it occurs. A team of Singapore scientists finally think they have solved the mystery and think the secret lies in the unique properties of the bonds that hold water together. Hydrogen bonds bring individual . water molecules into close contact, which triggers natural repulsion . between the water molecules and causes the bonds between oxygen and . hydrogen atoms to stretch as well as store energy. So as the liquid warms, it makes the water molecules sit further apart from each other as the hydrogen bonds stretch. When . the molecules shrink again and give up their energy, this results in it . cooling, which the scientists say means that warm water cools faster . than cold water and explains the Mpemba effect. The Mpemba effect - why hot water freezes more quickly than cold water - is named after a Tanzanian student who took cookery classes in the 1960s and found a hot ice cream mixture froze faster than a cold one. But the strange behaviour of freezing water has been noted by great thinkers throughout . history, including Aristotle and Descartes. Scientists have tried to explain the Mpemba effect before and theories included the idea that warm containers made better thermal contact with frezers to conduct heat faster and that as warm water evaporates more swiftly, it cools the water, which allows it to freeze faster. But a study led by Xi Zhang at the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, said the reason for the Mpemba effect is down to the unique properties of the molecular bonds that hold water together, Physics blog Medium.com reported. A single water molecule is made from a large oxygen atom joined to two hydrogen atoms with covalent bonds (a chemical bond that involves the sharing of two electron pairs between atoms). But when a hydrogen atom in one molecule drifts close to an oxygen atom in another water molecule, it bonds with it, creating what is called a hydrogen bond. It is these hydrogen bonds that behave in a peculiar way and have attracted the attention of the researchers. A water molecule is made from an oxygen atom joined to two hydrogen atoms with covalent bonds (a bond that involves the sharing of two electron pairs). When a hydrogen atom drifts close to an oxygen atom, it bonds with it, creating a hydrogen bond. It's the strange behaviour of these bonds that explains the Mpemba effect . The strange behaviour of hot water freezing more quickly has been noted by great thinkers throughout history, including Aristotle (pictured) and Descartes . Strangely, while hydrogen bonds are generally weaker than covalent bonds, they are stronger than the 'van der Waals' force' that is the sum of the attractive forces between molecules other than those due to covalent bonds. Chemists have long suspected the hydrogen bonds were what gives water some strange properties and enables its boiling point to be much higher than other liquids composed of similar molecules - because the hydrogen bonds hold it together so well. Research into the exact roles the hydrogen bonds play have been investigated by scientists who have recently found water molecules restricted into tiny tubes form chains and are linked together by hydrogen bonds. It is these tiny chains that enable a plant to pull water molecules up through its roots. But now Dr Zhang's team believe these bonds explain the Mpemba effect, as the hydrogen bonds bring individual water molecules into close contact, which triggers natural repulsion between the molecules and causes the covalent bonds between oxygen and hydrogen bonds to stretch as well as store energy. So as the liquid warms, it makes the water molecules sit further apart from each other as the hydrogen bonds stretch. The Mpemba effect is named after a Tanzanian student who took cookery classes in the 1960s and found a hot ice cream mixture froze faster than a cold one. When the molecules shrink again and give up their energy, this results in it cooling, which the scientists say means that warm water cools faster than cold water and explains the Mpemba effect. To prove their theory, the chemists calculated the size of the extra cooling caused by the molecular activity and showed that it accounts for the observed differences between the freezing of hot and cold water in experiments. However, some physicists have noted that the explanation cannot currently be used to predict new properties of water that could be created by shortening covalent bonds, for example so there is one step to go before the mystery is satisfactorily solved.","The Mpemba effect, named after Tanzanian .

"Borussia Dortmund are officially the worst team in the Bundesliga. So says the league table and, of course, that never lies. After Sunday's 2-0 defeat by Eintracht Frankfurt, Dortmund are rock bottom of the league, having amassed only 11 points from 13 games. Even their famous fans, who have stuck by the team throughout this nightmare season, have begun to boo and whistle their players. On Sunday evening, director of sport Michael Zorc has conceded the club are 'in the middle of a relegation fight', but what are the reasons for Dortmund's downfall, and could they really find themselves in the second division in May? The manager . Jurgen Klopp has seemed ever more helpless in the past weeks, as he watched his team stumble from catastrophe to catastrophe. His job remains safe, and he insisted this weekend that he wouldn't resign, saying he takes 'full responsibility' for his team's woes. He has to say that, but it is difficult to ignore the errors he has made. VIDEO Scroll down for match highlights of the defeat that sent Dortmund rock bottom . Borussia Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp comforts his Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang after their latest loss . Klopp the tactician, having experimented with 4-1-4-1 at the start of the season, reverted quickly to 4-2-3-1, and has not changed since. He is now being accused of lacking a Plan B. Klopp the motivator, meanwhile, has failed to exploit the successes in Europe and the victory against Borussia Monchengladbach in order to break his side's psychological rut against smaller teams. He is still linked with jobs in the Barclays Premier League or with the national team, but the longer the current crisis goes on, the more one asks: how much does anyone else really want him? Klopp is still linked with jobs in the Premier League and with the national team amid the Dortmund crisis . The players . One of the reasons it has taken Dortmund fans so long to boo their team is because there has been no lack of effort on the part of the players. Statistically, Dortmund have run more kilometers than any other team in the league, and they are clearly desperate to give the 'blood, sweat and tears' which chief executive Hans Joachim Watzke demanded of them last week. Injuries to Marco Reus have kept Borussia Dortmund's best player out for most of the autumn . Injuries have kept their most magical player, Marco Reus, out for most of the autumn, however, and the new signings are still yet to settle in. Ciro Immobile has scored only six goals this season, and is struggling with the Klopp system, while World Cup winner Matthias Ginter is having  problems with the step up from Freiburg. It was his mistake which cost Dortmund the first goal against Frankfurt on Sunday. Ciro Immobile has scored only six goals this season for Dortmund and is struggling with the Klopp system . The playing style . Klopp's famous Gegenpressing, the art of pushing high up the pitch without the ball and striking ruthlessly in the transition, has been fine against teams like Bayern, Gladbach and their Champions League opponents. These teams attack more, and give Dortmund the space which they so love to exploit behind the defence. Most of the worst defeats have come against theoretically inferior opposition, who have kept Dortmund out efficiently and mercilessly punished the endless mistakes at the back. World Cup winner Matthias Ginter (right) is having problems with the step up from Freiburg . Ginter is not alone in this regard – all of Dortmund's defenders have cost their team at one point or another through silly errors. If Klopp is to fix this mess, he needs to adapt his playing style for defensive teams. At the moment, he seems unable to. Ginter (at the front) is not alone  – all of Dortmund's defenders have cost their team at one point through errors . The results . Even with the sloppy defence, one thing is notable about all the nightmare results Dortmund have endured this year. They have not lost by more than two goals this year, and often have the lion's share of the chances. Defeats like the 2-1 against Cologne, the 1-0 against Hannover and the 2-0 against Mainz could have been turned into victories if Dortmund had had a better conversion rate. The same could be said of the 2-2 draws against Paderborn and Stuttgart. Once again, the likes of Immobile and Aubameyang have not been up to scratch as replacements for the injured Reus and the transferred Lewandowski. Klopp's Dortmund are struggling to say the least this year as they sit bottom of the Bundesliga . The future . It is now officially a relegation battle for Dortmund. As Zorc put it: 'Until now, we've kept an eye on how far we are from the top in terms of points. We can stop doing that now.' Chief executive Watzke told shareholders last week that one season out of the Champions League would be no problem for Dortmund financially; relegation, on the other hand, would be disastrous, both for the sporting and the financial sides of things. In terms of this season, the team needs to haul itself out of the relegation zone. Klopp will stay, but he needs to make changes. Dortmund must pull themselves from the relegation zone in Germany as going down would be disastrous . The team need more tactical clarity at the back, and potentially a better goalscorer come the January transfer window.

"Juventus can reach their first two targets of the season in the next two weeks by reaching the last 16 of the Champions League and beating Napoli in the Italian Super Cup final, manager Massimiliano Allegri said on Monday. The first target can be achieved on Tuesday when Juve hosts last season's beaten finalists Atletico Madrid in their final Champions League Group A match and the second on December 22nd when Juve faces Napoli in the cup match in Qatar. The others - the Serie A crown and the Champions League title - will have to wait a little longer. Massimiliano Allegri (right) wants Juventus to reach the last 16 of the Champions League on Tuesday . Paul Pogba (right) shares a joke with Juve striker Fernando Llorente during training on Monday . Atletico are already through to the last 16 and will win the group as long as they do not lose by a margin of two goals or more to Juve. The Italians will go through with a draw or if Olympiakos do not win their match against already eliminated Malmo. If Juve beat Atletico by two goals or more they will finish top but Olympiakos can still pip them for a qualifying place if Juve lose and the Greeks win, so Allegri is taking nothing for granted. Andrea Pirlo walks onto the Juventus training pitch followed by boss Allegri . Allegri looks on during his team's Monday morning training session . 'We have to reach the knock-out stage,' he told reporters on Monday. 'It is this season's first goal, with the second not too far behind.' A year ago Juventus faced a similar situation only to lose in Istanbul to Galatasaray and finish in third place. Juve are unbeaten in their last nine European matches at home and Allegri is optimistic that his men won't slip up now. Allegri will be hoping that Pogba can lead his side to victory over Atletico Madrid in Tuesday's encounter . 'I have a very strong team that has shown it can play at this level in the five previous games,' Allegri added. Despite both clubs boasting European pedigrees going back to the 1950s, they have only met once previously with Atletico beating Juventus 1-0 in Madrid in October with Arda Turan scoring the only goal. He says that the two teams will be approaching Tuesday's match in very different frames of mind. 'It a completely different scenario. We want to finish in first place and, therefore, avoid other group winners, while Atletico wants to protect its leadership.' Allegri praised Diego Simeone for taking Atletico to La Liga glory last season over Real Madrid and Barcelona . But he was guarded when asked if Diego Simeone, Atletico's coach, would be a worthy winner of FIFA's Coach of the Year award. 'Simeone is doing a terrific job,' Allegri said. 'To win 'La Liga' finishing ahead of giants like Real Madrid and Barcelona is exceptional. 'But Carlo and Loew are also deserving,' he said of Carlo Ancelotti who led Real Madrid to the Champions League title last season and Joachim Loew who coached Germany to World Cup glory.","Massimiliano Allegri wants to lead Juventus into Champions League last 16 .

"Tottenham's Europa League clash with Besiktas was suspended twice after the floodlights in the ground suddenly went out. Referee Stefan Johannesson had to halt play in the eighth minute and send the players back to the dressing rooms before the problem could be resolved, with  a thirteen minute delay in play. The floodlights went out again in second-half stoppage time and after a brief delay the players  returned to play out the final few minutes. It's the second successive Europa League match to be suspended for Tottenham following pitch invaders interrupting play at White Hart Lane against Partizan Belgrade last month. Play was suspended twice in Istanbul after the floodlights cut out suddenly during the match . The Ataturk Olympic Stadium descended into darkness as the fans used their phones to light up the stands . This was the scene in Istanbul after Tottenham's clash with Besiktas was delayed after a light blackout . The sparse section of supporters did their best to light up the stadium with their phones and  the lighting issues were resolved within quarter of an hour and the players came back out to continue the match. With the game at 1-0 thanks to Cenk Tosun's second-half strike, the floodlights cut out again in the 91st minute with Johannesson forced to suspend play in Istanbul for a second time.

On Thursday it was announced that Tottenham have been fined 15,000 euros (£11,870) by UEFA over the three pitch invasions during match against Partizan Belgrade, which Spurs won 1-0. The match on November 27 at White Hart Lane was suspended late in the first-half following three separate pitch invasions, which appeared to be a planned PR stunt. The three pitch invaders wore T-shirts bearing the name of a headphone manufacturer associated with Spurs and six other Premier League teams, as they attempted to take selfies with Spurs players. UEFA's control, ethics and disciplinary body (CEDB) fined Spurs with the police having already charged the three men involved which caused the match to be delayed for around 10 minutes just before half-time.

"Manuel Neuer enjoyed his first training session since being named on the final three-man Ballon d'Or shortlist as Bayern Munich's players were put through their paces on Tuesday. The Germany international will fight it out with Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi for the prestigious award next month but it was business as usual for Pep Guardiola's men as they trained ahead of Saturday's game with Bayer Leverkusen.

"Host commentator . 91mins: Barry sends a free-kick into the area as Everton look for a late equaliser but Granqvist clears his lines well. 88mins: Krasnodar are in total control here as Gethin Jones replaces Browning. 85mins: Browning looks to push forward before passing the ball onto Barry. The ball is worked to Long on the left of the Krasnodar penalty area, but his shot is tame and saved easily by Sinitsin. 80mins: Garbutt sends Long chasing a loose ball as Sigurdsson flies in a concedes a free-kick. Garbutt sends the resulting set piece onto the head of Kone but the forward can only send it high and wide. 78mins: Chris Long replace McAleny. 73mins: The goal scorer Laborde is replaced by Burmistrov. 72mins: Krasnodar should be 2-0 ahead as chance come and go for both Joaozinho and Izmailov. The former found himself one-on-one with Robles, but played the ball back rather than going for goal. Izmailov then scuffs his shot just wide. 68mins: At one end, Kone jinks his way through the Krasnodar defence brilliantly before losing out before Izmailov's long range effort is blocked. 64mins: 17-year-old Dowell almost had his big moment after being played into the penalty area by Oviedo. Just as the youngster pulls the trigger is shot is blocked and cleared for a corner. 59mins: Pienaar is shown a yellow card for a late challenge on Pereyra. Laborde sends the resulting 30-yard free-kick well over the bar. 54mins: The ball squirms through Kone is the box before falling to Oviedo, but the returning full back is unable to connect. Elliott Bretland: On first vieweing it appeared the away end was empty but I'm reliably informed there are 14 Krasnodar fans who have made the trip for this dead-rubber. (I can just make them out from the press box, dotted around the corner of the Bullens Road) Dedication! 49mins: Robles is forced into action once again by Laborde, who hits a low shot across the tall keeper. At the other end, Kone fires a shot towards the top corner which Sinitsin beats away. 47mins: The Toffees haven't started very and it's the away side who look to maintain possession. Garbutt, however, continues his impressive evening by claiming the ball and winning an Everton throw from the left. We're back underway at Goodison Park. The result may matter very little, but Martinez will want his young players to put down a marker in front of a home crowd. There goes the whistle as we reach the break at Goodison Park. Impressive stuff from Krasnodar, who lead thanks to a Laborde goal. 43mins: Kone, who has been impressive so far, is shown a yellow card for a slight elbow on  Kaleshin. Looks to be a very harsh booking as the replay shows Kone just shielding the ball. 41mins: Garbutt and Pienaar link well down the left as a piece of skill from the youngsters earns his side a corner. The set piece is cleared. 37mins: McAleny has a chance to lead a breakout on the right but gives the ball away far to easily in the centre circle. Very quiet at Goodison as the away knock the ball around confidently. Elliott Bretland: Left back Luke Garbutt has certainly been taking tips from Leighton Baines at Finch Farm. The 21-year-old gathered the ball off Steven Pienaar before going on a lung-busting run before his cross was locked by the Krasnodar defender. Impressive running by the defender. The away side may have nothing to play for but they have taken the lead at Goodison Park. Laborde races through on goal and just when it looks as though Joel has it covered, the Colombian forward turns and knocks the ball past the keepr's front post. Elliott Bretland: Arouna Kone has looked sharp in the opening fifteen minutes. Just before the quarter of an hour mark the Ivorian sensed an opportunity as space opened up in front of him from about 20 yards out. The Everton No 9 let fly only to be denied by Krasnodar keeper Andrei Sinitsin who made a smart save down to his right. A bright start from the former Wigan forward. 24mins: Krasnodar enjoy their first spell of pressure which culminates in a deflected shot from Laborde which sails out for a corner. Dominic King: All very quiet here so far. Little zip to the game, muted enthusiasm from a sparse crowd. That said, it will be interesting to see how Kieran Dowell and Ryan Ledson fare in this contest. Roberto Martinez holds both players in high regard and was anxious to reward their progress with a game. Neither player looks short of confidence. 14mins: Kone looks desperate to get off the mark tonight. The frontman hits a powerful strike from 20-yards out which is beaten away by Krasnodar keeper. Elliott Bretland: The rain is battering down at Goodison Park here tonight as an Everton fringe side look to complete the Toffees' Group H campaign unbeaten. Returning from a nightmare 15 months on the sidelines, can Arouna Kone, playing as the lone frontman, score his first Everton goal? 11mins: Huge blow for Atsu who is forced off with what looks to be a hamstring injury. Atsu's loss is Dowell's gain, however, as the youngster comes on for his debut. Not much to tell you about from the opening seven minutes of this game. Just a word, though, on the travelling support. Krasnodar have brought 14 fans with them from southern Russia, and Everton have provided them with hospitality for the evening... The teams are out at Goodison Park and we are underway. Everton are in their traditional blue shirts with white shorts while the visitors are wearing white with black shorts. As mentioned earlier, Everton have already won Group H and therefore this match means very little to them. Back to back victories in match day four and five against Wolfsburg and Lille have taken them to 11 points from five games and they are still unbeaten. Krasnodar cannot qualify tonight as they sit bottom of the table with three points. The best they can hope for is to earn their first win of the group stage and finish third ahead of Lille, who take on Wolfsburg. The teams drew 1-1 when they met in Russia in October. Here is the side that Roberto Martinez has selected tonight: . Everton: Robles, Browning, Alcaraz, Barry, Garbutt, Ledson, Oviedo, McAleny, Pienaar, Atsu, Kone . Elliott Bretland is at Goodison Park. He says: 'The thinking before the game was that right back Tyias Browning or left back Luke Garbutt may have been played at centre back but instead Roberto Martinez has plumped for Gareth Barry alongside Antolin Alcaraz. Good to see Browning and Garbutt starting in their natural positions. ' Kick-off coming up at 8:05pm . It's all change for Roberto Martinez against Krasnodar tonight with Everton's progression to the knock-out rounds of the Europa League already secure. The Toffees take on their Russian opposition at Goodison Park having won the group with a game to spare. Nevertheless, tonight will be a chance for some of the fringe players and upcoming talent to shine, and team news is on the way very shortly... Follow Sportmail's live coverage of the Europa League Group H clash between Everton and Krasnodar. With his side already qualified and guaranteed top spot, Roberto Martinez had the opportunity to blood some youngsters with the likes of Tyias Browning and Luke Garbutt featuring.

"John Kennedy believes Ronny Deila has turned a corner. After six months in Glasgow, the Norwegian is slowly beginning to look and sound like a Celtic manager. No 3 in the first-team coaching set-up, former Parkhead central defender Kennedy was as in the dark about Deila as everyone else at first. He knew little or nothing about the man he was asked to work with. Unheralded and unproven outwith Norwegian football, Deila seemed almost overwhelmed by the demands of his new job in those early days. A casual drink in a Glasgow pub at the end of the night became an ordeal. Posing for pictures became an invasive way of life. Ronny Deila has turned things around at Parkhead following a slow start . On the field, his system was unfamiliar to the players, results hinting at a lack of understanding between the manager and his charges. As Christmas approaches, however, Celtic are three points clear at the top of the SPFL Premiership. The air of crisis has passed – for now - and Deila looks to be finding his feet. They could always score more goals – notably so against Motherwell on Saturday. Yet, since a 1-0 home defeat by Hamilton in October, Celtic have now kept five clean sheets in seven league games. ‘Sometimes it looks as though it’s stuttering along and question marks start,’ said Kennedy. ‘But, in recent weeks, you can see a team that’s fully committed to what the manager is trying to do. Once you get that things can only move forward.’ Deila was named the SPFL Manager of the Month for November after four-straight wins . The ideas were radical at first. Deila brought many of his own fitness and analysis staff over from Norway. The diet was famously overhauled and sports scientist Jim McGuiness was promoted to the first team. The blunt truth is that some still don’t care for this stuff. A change of culture and philosophy is an unsettling business and some of the existing staff and players will inevitably leave because they haven’t bought into it. For his part, Kennedy is convinced by the changes made so far. ‘Ronny was new to me, as well, when he came in,’ he continued. ‘Initially, he was finding his feet, and the thing that catches people off guard is the magnitude and size of the club, the focus that’s on them every day. ‘He’s certainly settled in, he’s the right type of character for this type of job and he has all the players on board for where he wants to go. First-team coach John Kennedy (right) believes the players are buying into Deila's methods . ‘I think we’re beginning to see more and more of that. At first, it’s always the same - a new manager with new ideas and things take time. ‘He hasn’t changed his style in the dressing room. He can be heated when he wants to be and really enthusiastic when he wants to but generally he’s very calm and thoughtful about what he’s trying to do. ‘He doesn’t get too worked up and he makes sure that when the players go out on the pitch, whether that be before the match or at half-time, he’s very clear about what he wants. That’s very important.’ There are times, most notably after away victories, when Deila does become worked up. Deila has developed a bond with Celtic supporters after his post-match fist-pumping displays . After the 1-0 win over Motherwell on Saturday, the Celtic coach indulged in another of the first pumping displays of bonding with the travelling support which have become his new practice. If it seems a little forced at times, there is method in his actions. The supporters like to see a manager – especially an outsider – display passion for their club. ‘You obviously also have to have the character and everything else to drive the players on, which he’s got, but at the right time he’s got a calm head to make sure that he is clear in his instructions,’ said Kennedy. ‘From my perspective, it’s been a fantastic learning curve working under him. He is very specific in what he wants from us all and he certainly makes sure that in training every day he drums it into the players what he wants on pitch at match time. Anthony Stokes scored the only goal of the game in Saturday's 1-0 win at Motherwell . ‘It has probably taken time but certainly from my perspective we’re beginning to see that.’ The process of change has not all been one way. An idealist at heart, Deila began life as Celtic manager with a dogged attitude to how his teams should play the game. The 4-2-3-1 formation has never altered – he won’t change that – but there is an acceptance now that he will only be given the time to change things if he is winning games. Altering a culture while carving out results is a tricky balancing act. Thursday’s Europa League game with Dinamo Zagreb – Celtic are already in the last 32 - offers a rare opportunity to try things without having to win the match. Deila has won over Celtic supporters after finally getting things right on the pitch . And yet, still, people will expect a performance and result of an acceptable standard. For Deila, this has been the biggest lesson of all at Parkhead. ‘Winning is the big thing at Celtic,’ added Kennedy. ‘If you go two matches without winning all of a sudden the question marks come out - but that’s the nature of the beast and that will never change. ‘When you are the manager or a player, you just have to have the mentality to deal with that and that’s something he knows about now. He’s well aware that when we don’t play well just make sure you still win the match. ‘Performance-wise, you want to win with style - but when that style doesn’t come across in a specific game just make sure you win it and move on.’","Celtic are now three points clear at the top of the SPL after slow start .

"A defiant FIFA president Sepp Blatter declared there was no moving the 2022 World Cup from Qatar, despite widespread concerns about the bidding process that took the tournament to the Middle East for the first time. '2022, it is Qatar, and ladies and gentleman, believe me, with all that has been said around the world by whom? Those not involved with what happens in football. The World Cup in 2022 will be played in Qatar,' the 78-year-old Swiss told Asian Football Confederation members in Manila on Sunday. The remarks, cheered and applauded loudly by Asian delegates, come as FIFA faces heavy criticism for not publishing a report by ethics investigator Michael Garcia into the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.

FIFA has said it cannot be publish the full report for legal reasons. A report in The Sunday Times said it had passed on a dossier revealing further allegations of corruption regarding the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids, to a House of Commons committee and which were published on Saturday.

"Click here to see our brilliant Match Zone, including a pitch map of Charlie Austin's all-action performance. Manuel Pellegrini will be thankful for two things on Sunday morning. One, it is the end of a difficult week and two, Sergio Aguero plays for Manchester City. The Argentine, yet again, dug his team out of a huge hole with a breathtaking double as City twice came from behind to snatch a draw at Queens Park Rangers. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Premier League Big Match Stats: QPR vs Manchester City . Charlie Austin, who had already had two goals disallowed, scores to put QPR ahead at home to the Premier League champions . Sergio Aguero follows up his brilliant control to fire past the despairing lunge of Steven Caulker and level the scores at Loftus Road . Bobby Zamora celebrates after Martin Demichelis had headed into his own net to put QPR back ahead with 15 minutes to play . Aguero stays calm after rounding Rob Green to level for City again, as the champions showed resolve to come back for a point . Referee Mike Dean explains his decision to the players after controversially, but correctly, disallowing Charlie Austin's strike . QPR: Green, Isla, Caulker, Dunne, Yun, Vargas, Sandro, Henry, Fer, Austin, Zamora. Subs: Hill, Phillips, Barton, McCarthy, Onuoha, Kranjcar, Hoilett. Man City: Hart, Sagna, Demichelis, Mangala, Clichy, Fernandinho, Fernando, Jesus Navas, Toure, Nasri, Aguero. Subs: Zabaleta, Milner, Dzeko, Caballero, Lampard, Jovetic, Boyata. Referee: Mike Dean . City’s defeat by CSKA Moscow — not to mention the red cards and pending European suspensions of Yaya Toure and Fernandinho — leaves Pellegrini’s men with a Champions League mountain to climb, so the manager was looking for a response. And he would not have liked what he saw in the opening 20 minutes as QPR came flying out of the blocks. Rangers thought they had taken an eighth-minute lead when Charlie Austin thumped a header from Eduardo Vargas’s cross past Joe Hart, only for the effort to be ruled out for offside. Then came a moment of controversy when, from the resultant free-kick, Austin thought he had grabbed the opener. As Hart took the free-kick, he inadvertently touched the ball with his standing foot, and, from his second touch, the intentional kick went straight to Austin. The QPR striker smashed an 18-yard drive past Hart to send Loftus Road into a frenzy. Once more, though, referee Mike Dean disallowed the goal. QPR players were incensed, supporters bewildered. Why on earth was that goal disallowed? Dean, though, was spot on with his decision. FIFA rules state that a free-kick awarded to the defending team in their own box must be retaken if the ball does not leave the penalty area after the first touch. Hart’s inadvertent first kick did not leave the area, meaning the ball was not in play. Sergio Aguero's first goal came from patient build-up in the City half, followed by a penatrating long ball - see more in our Match Zone . Austin's first disallowed goal came from a header which he powered past Joe Hart, but he was several yards offside . From the resulting free kick Hart stumbled slightly in his run up before appearing to give the ball straight to Austin on the edge of the box . Hart had actually caught the ball with his standing foot, meaning that he had played the ball twice in the box, and had to retake the kick . Austin finished with aplomb, but Dean had already stopped the game, and despite QPR feeling aggrieved, the official was right . Hart's free kick was required to leave the box before the ball could be considered back in play - so by touching it for a second time, he prevented the ball from becoming live. Riley was correct, but the sense of injustice only served to spur QPR on as they continued with their excellent start. Hart then produced an excellent point-blank save to deny Austin, after Bobby Zamora laid off Sandro’s 14th-minute cross. City were let off the hook again later when Riley rejected a strong penalty appeal after Sandro’s long-range effort seemed to hit Bacary Sagna on the arm. Pellegrini’s side were rattled. And QPR finally took advantage in the 21st minute. Lively Vargas found Austin with a perfect through ball. City protested for an offside, but Riley could not save them this time as Austin — in front of England manager Roy Hodgson — scored his sixth of the season. The champions were on the ropes, a shadow of the team that secured their second title in three years last season. Toure went close to an equaliser but his shot drifted wide of Rob Green’s far post. QPR players surround the referee after seeing two goals disallowed inside a minute, but Mike Dean stuck to his decision . Charlie Austin, who was also denied early on by a brilliant save from Hart, cannot believe how he still hasn't scored . Austin did eventually find the back of the net with a legal strike after 21 minutes, his fourth goal in three Premier League games . Yaya Toure and Eliaquim Mangala look dispirited as Manchester City were outplayed by QPR in the opening stages . Sergio Aguero finished brilliantly as the champions scored on the break to level things up, despite Rob Green's complaints . England manager Roy Hodgson was at Loftus Road to watch Charlie Austin, with the QPR striker in the frame for a rise from non-League football to the England squad within six years. Austin’s form — Saturday’s was his sixth Premier League goal of the season — has impressed Hodgson. City needed a hero. As ever, up stepped Aguero to dig them out of a hole. Eliaquim Mangala’s punt towards the Argentine was hopeful but what followed was sheer brilliance. Aguero effortlessly pulled the ball out of the air, twisted and turned past Steven Caulker before finishing past Green. Where would City be without the South American? His goal should have been the signal for City to take control. Toure twice failed to make the keeper work in good positions just outside the box, though Richard Dunne was lucky not to see a red card after lashing out at Samir Nasri. City did not look comfortable as their defensive frailties resurfaced. Hart denied Austin after the England hopeful hammered a shot straight at the keeper. And England’s No 1 produced an even better save to deny Austin from close range seconds later, though the striker was ruled offside. The Argentinian striker celebrates his 10th Premier League goal of the season, although QPR believed there was a handball in the build-up . Green was adamant that Aguero had controlled the ball with his arm in the lead-up to the goal, but it was allowed to stand . Harry Redknapp cannot believe what he is seeing as, despite having the ball in the net three times, his side went into half time level . Leroy Fer battles with Bacary Sagna as QPR showed passion and quality against a Manchester City side badly lacking form . MINS PLD    KM    MILES .

As if the first-half was not exhilarating enough, Rangers boss Harry Redknapp sent on Joey Barton for Sandro at half-time. And the entertainment continued during the early stages of the second-half, Toure, Nasri and Jesus Navas all firing dangerous low crosses without finding a team-mate. QPR did not sit back either, Leroy Fer watching his drive from 16 yards fly inches wide after a deflection off Martin Demichelis while Caulker fired an effort wide. City fans were calling for Frank Lampard and they got their wish when he was introduced for sub Edin Dzeko. But Lampard was helpless as he watched QPR regain the lead in the 76th minute as Austin turned provider, firing in a great cross and Demichelis put into his own net under pressure from Zamora. The Argentine put his hands together as if to pray. Indeed, his side needed divine inspiration. They nearly got it just two minutes after falling behind when Barton sent Aguero clear with a poor header. The Argentine cooly skipped past Green, but Dunne was on hand to clear his effort. Caulker followed suit soon after, clearing James Milner’s header off the line before Green saved Toure’s follow-up strike. But just like the first-half, City were rescued by their sensational Argentine. Latching onto Toure’s excellent pass, Aguero’s control was exquisite as he slotted past Green in the 83rd minute to earn a draw. Mangala, who struggled throughout in the absence of Vincent Kompany, climbs all over Austin, conceding a free kick . Zamora celebrates with Eduardo Vargas after his pressure caused Demichelis to head Austin's cross into the corner of his own net . Zamora congratulates Austin for his excellent performance after the striker's cross produced the vital second goal for QPR .

"Danny Simpson insists all Leicester players are fully behind manager Nigel Pearson despite losing at Aston Villa to extend their winless run to 10 matches. The right-back made his first start since signing from Queens Park Rangers at Villa Park as goals from Ciaran Clark and Alan Hutton wiped out Leo Ulloa's opener. Leicester sit bottom and Pearson was caught on camera last week telling an abusive supporter to 'f*** off and die'. Danny Simpson, pictured challenging for the ball with Christian Benteke, says the Leicester players are all behind under-fire manager Nigel Pearson . Simpson is seen deep in discussion with Foxes keeper Kasper Schmeichel during Sunday's defeat at Villa . Simpson insisted the squad back their manager '100 per cent'. 'If it wasn't that you would see it from the outside,' he said. 'From the performances you could say ""They aren't behind him"". 'We are trying to do the right things and it has to turn. A couple of wins and everything changes. Alan Hutton scored what turned out to be the winning goal for his side - his first-ever for Aston Villa .

The next few weeks it'll be important.' Simpson believes poor form has actually brought the players together. 'It can do and it probably has, it goes one way or the other,' he added. 'It's a tight group and we know it has to change. 'It's not like we're coming in and having a pop at each other and saying 'You didn't do this or that'.

"Leicester full back Paul Konchesky's red card against Aston Villa on Sunday has been rescinded. The 33-year-old was dismissed by referee Craig Pawson following a clash with Villa defender Alan Hutton in the Foxes' 2-1 defeat at Villa Park. A Football Association statement read: 'Leicester City's Paul Konchesky, who was dismissed for violent conduct in the game against Aston Villa on December 7, 2014 will not serve a suspension after a claim of wrongful dismissal was upheld following an Independent Regulatory Commission hearing today.' Paul Konchesky was shown a red card by referee Craig Pawson during Leicester's defeat by Aston Villa . The Football Association have revealed Konchesky will not serve a ban following the incident at Villa Park . Konchesky made a late challenge on Alan Hutton before clashing with the Scottish international . Leicester manager Nigel Pearson appeared reluctant to appeal against the sending-off when he spoke about it in Sunday's post-match press conference. 'It's difficult to have a decision like that rescinded in all honesty,' he said. 'I think it would lack a bit of class for me to ask for retrospective action against another manager's player. 'When moments pass you by in games officials are there to do a job, to do it as best they can. 'I can understand because of how it looked - it was because he was pushed away and they kept in contact. In the initial contact I don't think Paul was the instigator. 'It's easy to be over critical. I don't want to get into a debate about getting other players sent off.' However, the club took the decision to contest the three-match ban and it has now been successfully overturned, leaving Konchesky free to play, starting against Manchester City on Saturday.

"The FA have strongly defended England 2018’s level of co-operation with Michael Garcia’s World Cup bid corruption report after an MP claimed they withheld vital evidence. John Whittingdale, chairman of the Culture, Media and Sport select committee, said he had ‘very serious’ questions and intended to write to bid officials asking them to hand over their database of bid information to Parliament. This follows the DCMS publishing a dossier, compiled by the Sunday Times, said to contain information the FA failed to make available. John Whittingdale, chairman of the Culture, Media and Sport select committee,  said he had ‘very serious’ questions about England 2018’s level of co-operation with Michael Garcia’s World Cup bid corruption report . The FA insist they disclosed every document and only withheld hearsay, gossip and rumour — and this was done with the agreement of ethics investigator Garcia. An FA statement said: ‘The FIFA ethics committee made specific requests and responding to these involved searching in excess of half-a-million documents. The search parameters were established with Mr Garcia’s office. All documents within the search parameters were disclosed.’ The dossier accuses Russia and Qatar, who are hosting the 2018 and 2022 World Cups respectively, of vote-trading and vote-buying while England are alleged to have colluded in a botched vote-swap with South Korea.

"FIFA are refusing to rule out the possibilty of a re-vote on the locations of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups or that Russia and/or Qatar could be stripped of the tournaments. FIFA president Sepp Blatter has stated unequivocally that Russia and Qatar will stage the events and ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert has ruled that a corruption probe found nothing that to undermine the ‘integrity’ of the votes, which were four years ago this week. But well-placed sources have told The Mail on Sunday that the integrity of the 14-8 vote in favour of Qatar for 2022 in particular is ‘clouded in doubt at the least’ because of two ongoing investigations involving voting members of FIFA’s Exectuive Committee (ExCo). FIFA president Sepp Blatter reveals Qatar as the host for the 2022 World Cup back in 2010 . As the MoS revealed last week, five FIFA officials face criminal investgation in Switzerland arising from bid business and several are believed to be ExCo voters. FIFA investigator Michael Garcia is separately investigating alleged breaches of FIFA’s ethics code by four ExCo voters from 2010: Angel Maria Villar Llona of Spain, Worawi Makudi from Thailand and Michel D’Hooghe from Belgium (all still on the ExCo) and Franz Beckenbauer of Germany. As few as three invalidated votes for Qatar for 2022 would potentially be enough to have changed the outcome in the USA’s favour and one source believes voters contributing six or more Qatar votes are among those being probed. Michael Garcia is investigating three FIFA executive committee members following World Cup probe . Blatter insists no re-vote will take place for 2018 and 2022 World Cups but FIFA refused to rule it out . When the Mail on Sunday asked FIFA to clarify whether Russia and Qatar would keep the events regardless of the investigations, a spokeswoman said only: ‘The 2018 FIFA World Cup was awarded to Russia and the 2022 FIFA World Cup to Qatar. FIFA does not comment on speculation.’ A British inquiry into alleged fraud in the process is underway by the Serious Fraud Office and will be mentioned in a parliamentary debate on Monday arranged by campaigning MP Damian Collins.

"England fans may be desperate to see Sam Burgess in the centres but Bath head coach Mike Ford believes the star’s future will be as a ‘barn-storming’ back row. After the former Great Britain and England rugby league player made his debut against Harlequins on Friday night, both Ford and Burgess faced a barrage of questions about the 25-year-old’s future position.

Sam Burgess charges into the Harlequins defence with his first touch of the ball in rugby union . There was plenty of excitement at the Rec as rugby league superstar Sam Burgess was named on the bench . While Ford plans to play him in the midfield over the coming weeks, he will eventually be moved into the forwards - despite England’s shortage at No 12. ‘He’ll play his first few games at 12 but we’re going to have a look at him in the back row as well. I think that will suit him more,’ said Ford. ‘He’s a guy who carries a lot and tackles a lot, you can’t stick him out in the centres and let him do nothing because that’s not his skillset. ‘Can he get over the gain-line with six, seven or eight on his back? Course he can. Bath head coach Mike Ford believes Burgess will be a 'barn-storming' back row forward in the long run . ‘After six or seven weeks we’ll know what his best position is. My vision is for him to be a barn-storming back row.’ Burgess was given 18 minutes of action for Bath but made a limited impact, despite two positive carries and one clear out at the breakdown. ‘I just wanted to touch the ball,’ he said. ‘It’s great to get that monkey off my back and to be part of the team.’ Burgess with girlfriend Phoebe Hooke watching England against Australia at Twickenham .

It took about three men to stop him. He is a powerful man and it will be nice to see him get a few more games and put his hand up.’ Asked if there is any possibility that the superstar from league could force his way into the squad for the Six Nations, Lancaster added: ‘That would be a big step, but who knows? We will wait and see. If he plays well, there’s a Saxons game in January...’ An outing for the country’s second-string side may be all it takes to convince England’s management to add Burgess to their championship plans.

"Dani King thought she was dying. Lying in the back of an ambulance, she was struggling for breath, in agony and unable to feel her feet. She began to panic that her body was shutting down. ‘It was horrible,’ she says. ‘I just remember looking into these really bright lights in the ambulance and thinking: “I’m too young”.’ An hour earlier she had been descending on her bike on a rain-soaked road in south Wales. It was part of a training regime designed to give her the endurance to secure a second Olympic gold. She won gold in 2012 in the team pursuit with Laura Trott and Joanna Rowsell and is looking for a repeat in Brazil in 2016. Olympic cyclist Dani King (left) admits she thought she was close to death after a training accident . King posted Twitter images of her recovery that saw her left with eight broken ribs and a punctured lung . The 24-year-old gives a thumbs up from her hospital bed holding her Teddy bear . But a rider to her left hit a pothole at more than 30mph and lost control, taking King with him as he hit the tarmac. Riding behind her was a former rugby player weighing over 16 stone. Unable to avoid the 24-year-old, his front wheel rammed into King’s side before he too was thrown off his bike. The impact left King with eight broken ribs and a punctured lung. Had a bone fragment damaged another organ it could have been far more serious. Even so, she had to spend two days in intensive care and a further 10 on a ward. Sitting here in a London hotel only 10 days after she was discharged from hospital, it is hard to believe this is the same person. She seems fit and well, not a scratch on view, even if she admits to feeling apprehensive about getting back on a bike on the road. ‘We were about 100km into the ride,’ she says. ‘It was really bad weather, raining and cold. We were riding two abreast and a guy to my left hit a pothole and fell right into the group. I just hit him and went over my bars. A rider behind me rode into by back. That’s what did the damage really. It was bad luck.’ King thinks it was an hour before the first ambulance arrived. ‘When they did arrive there were two people with head injuries who needed help first,’ she says. ‘They were discharged later that day, but it meant I was the last to get in an ambulance. ‘It was carnage, horrible. I was in the road for over an hour, cold in the rain. I was aware straight away that I’d done something to my lung. I could only take the tiniest breaths. And I could feel my ribs grinding together. ‘I went into survival mode. I wasn’t crying, I was in so much pain, but because I knew I’d done something serious I realised I needed to stay calm and get the oxygen into my lung.’ King rides to victory in the Women's Team Pursuit at the  2012 Olympic Games in London . King celebrates winning gold and breaking the world record with team-mates Laura Trott and Joanna Rowsell . A shot of morphine enabled the paramedics to lift her on to a spinal board and into the ambulance. The mother of her boyfriend, the fellow professional cyclist Matt Rowe, had driven to the scene after receiving a phone call and joined her in the ambulance. ‘I genuinely thought I was going to die,’ she says. ‘I couldn’t feel my feet, and while they’d given me all the painkillers I could have I just couldn’t breathe. There was a scary moment in casualty too. My heart rate went from 50 to 150 in a split second. The doctors told Matt and his mum to leave the room and pulled the curtains round and called the doctor. Thankfully it must have just been a bit of shock.’ A scan revealed the collapsed lung. ‘I had to go straight into theatre to have a chest drain put in,’ she says. ‘They put the drain — this tube the width of a hosepipe — into the lung to remove the liquid and re-inflate the lung. And I had to have an epidural too because they said I wouldn’t be able to deal with the pain.’ She has proved a fast healer, and the doctors have said she will make a complete recovery. But some mental scars remain. ‘When I was on the floor I said, “I’m never going to ride a bike again”,’ she says. ‘I was thinking, “Is this actually worth it?” But it wasn’t long before I thought, “no, I will”. King has admitted she contemplated quitting the sport after the life-threatening accident . King (left) leads the field in the Women's Road Race during the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games . ‘That said, I will probably still be a bit worried about getting on a bike again. I wouldn’t be human if I wasn’t. I have suffered a significant trauma and it happened riding a bike. ‘My liver was bruised. The consultant told me that if one of the pieces of bone had become dislodged I would have had a 50 per cent chance of living. I was shown a 3D image of my bones. It was a mess. ‘I will find it hard getting back on the bike on the road. Especially in groups, in bad weather. ‘I’m sure it will come back (her confidence on the bike). It’s going to have to. Matt and I are planning to go on holiday somewhere warm where I can just ride and enjoy it. ‘Then when I come back I’ll start on my training plan, the aim being January 1 (the accident was on November 6). It might mean I miss a couple of early-season races but it won’t disrupt anything.’ King makes a point about the state of Britain’s roads, and the fact that other countries do invest more in cycling.

"Tennessee Titans running back Shonn Greene was arrested Friday after parking in a handicap spot and leaving as a parking enforcement officer was writing him a citation, police said. Greene had parked his BMW M6 in a reserved spot on the public square in Franklin, a Nashville suburb, and ignored an officer's requests to produce a handicap placard for the space. According to WTSP, as the officer wrote out a citation, Greene got into his vehicle and sped off, almost hitting her car. Failure to stop: Shonn Greene, Tennessee Titans running back, twice did not stop for a parking enforcement officer trying to issue a citation for parking in a handicapped spot . The officer followed the Titans player and when he stopped in traffic she attempted to hand the citation to Greene, who again ignored her, according to Franklin police Sgt Charles Warner. Avoided: Franklin police said that Greene was facing a $51 citation before he sped off, almost striking the parking enforcement officer's vehicle . 'This whole thing could have been avoided if Greene would have simply left that handicapped parking space available for whom it was intended,' said Warner. 'Even after getting caught illegally parking there, all he had to do was talk to the parking enforcement officer about the $51 citation she was writing him,' he added. After the second attempt, Greene was charged with misdemeanors of driving on a suspended license, reckless driving, failure to stop/halt/frisk and illegal parking. The player surrendered on Friday after learning there were multiple warrants out for his arrest. He was released on $2,000 bail and will face a court appearance November 13. The Tennessee Titans released a statement on Saturday that the team had spoken with Greene about the incident. 'This is not the type of behavior we expect from any member of our organization,' the statement read. 'We will continue to gather additional information as it becomes available and handle the matter internally.' Greene has spent the last two weeks nursing a hamstring injury, but his return for Sunday's game against the Houston Texans was 'probable' according to the team's injury report. Running: Greene is currently second among Titans running backs, with 44 carries totaling 190 yards this season . The former New York Jets running back is second on the Titans in rushing this season, with 190 yards on 44 tries with one touchdown.","Tennessee's Shonn Greene had parked in a handicap parking space and was approached by a parking enforcement officer Friday afternoon .

"The closest Amir Khan and Devon Alexander came to trash talking as they met face-to-face prior to their big Saturday night fight was to act like stand-up comics. Although the prize for the victor may well be a mega-bucks fight with Floyd Mayweather, both men still found time for humour. Alexander tickled Khan's ribs by telling the final media conference: 'I want to say hello to all my fans in the United Kingdom who are rooting for me. It seems they want me to win, so Amir, what's going on over there?' Amir Khan was in a relaxed mood ahead of his Saturday night showdown with Devon Alexander in Sin City . Alexander and Khanshare a smirk during an entertaining press conference at the MGM Grand . Khan and trainer Virgil Hunter share a moment as the Briton hopes to secure a shot at Floyd Mayweather . The St Louis-born fighter was in a humourous mood, paying tribute to his many fans in the UK . Oscar De La Hoya’s Golden Boy promotions, who represent both fighters, would reportedly prefer Khan to win . To which Khan responded: 'I need to say hello to all my fans in St Louis. I've got a lot of followers there and they're always asking me to go down to your town.' Each fighter referred the other to his record of taking on some of the world's leading boxers and both promised to put on 'a fun show' for the crowd at the MGM Grand Garden Arena and television viewers around the world. Alexander even insisted that coming to Vegas this week is a holiday, saying: 'Being here and fighting Amir is like a vacation for me.' Khan took that as a reference to the three defeats he has suffered in his career so far and said: 'I've learned from those and there will be no more mistakes. I'm going to enjoy a fight of speed, explosion and power.' Then he spoke for both him and his opponent, who are each claiming to be in the best condition of their lives when he said: 'So no excuses.'

"Amir Khan faces off against Devon Alexander on Friday - in a meeting of the scales rather than fists. The pair will stand toe-to-toe at the customary weigh-in before fight night at the MGM Grand Garden in Las Vegas. Khan and Alexander are both former champions in the 140lb light-welterweight division but have both made the step up to 147lbs in recent years. 28-year-old Khan has only fought once previously at this weight, which heralded a stellar performance against the experienced Luis Collazo in May. The Bolton-born boxer will be hoping for a similar outcome against 27-year-old Alexander on Saturday - at the same venue that he beat Collazo. In only his second fight as welterweight, Alexander won the IBF world title with a unanimous decision over Randall Bailey but subsequently lost his belt two fights later against Shawn Porter. Both fighters will be looking to produce a knockout performance in the hoping of landing a dream fight against either Floyd Mayweather or Manny Pacquiao.

"The chances are you know a friend or family member who has moved abroad. But if you make the effort to stay in touch regularly, then apparently you are in the minority. A new study has revealed that although more than half of British people have close family or friends living in other countries around the world, only 34 percent say they keep in regular contact with them. British parents revealed their top three favourite ways of staying in touch with their sons and daughters, which are online VOIP services . The research, carried out by international calling app ringo.co, showed that on average Britons have 13 close family or friends abroad. The top five destinations for British emigrates are Australia, accounting for 22 percent, followed by America with 19 per cent, Canada with 13 percent and New Zealand with nine percent. The top reason stated for not keeping in contact with parents, children, cousins, aunts and uncles, grandparents and best friends was the difficulty negotiating different time zones. A total of 26 per cent of the 2,006 people questioned in the survey said this was the main reason for not keeping up regular contact. The high cost of calling abroad was a factor for 18 per cent of people, while family and friends simply not being available to scheduled calls accounted for 14 per cent of people. British parents also revealed their top three favourite ways of staying in touch with their children. Online VOIP services was the most popular method, favoured by 35 per cent of people. A traditional landline closely followed, with 34 percent of people preferring picking up the phone. Texting was the top method of contacting relatives and friends for 32 percent of those questioned. Surprisingly, 14 percent of Britons said they still post letters abroad, making old-fashioned mail more popular than social networking site Twitter which was used by just eight percent. Australia was the top destination for British people moving abroad, accounting for 22 percent of emigrates . Even more surprisingly, younger Brits aged between 18-34 were found to be almost twice as likely to send  mail than the over-55s. There were 21 per cent of children living abroad who say they speak to their parents every week. The study was commissioned after a United Nations report released in July this year showed that number of Britons living abroad has soared in the last decade to top five million for the first time. Official data revealed where people born in the UK have chosen to settle, with a quarter emigrants jetting halfway around the world to live in Australia and four settling in San Marino. Cheap flights, more open borders and the need to find work in the wake of the financial crash mean more people live outside the country they were born in than ever before. In 1990 the figure was only 4.1m, meaning an increase of 23 per cent. Just 21 per cent of children living abroad say they speak to their parents every week . Official data from the United Nations reveals where the 5m Britons who have emigrated have chosen to settle . Australia was the most popular destination, with 1.277million expats, well ahead of the US where 758,919 Britons live and Canada, home to 674,371. Spain remains the most popular European country to live in for Brits, followed by Ireland, Germany and Italy. 'With more than half of Brits now having friends and family living abroad, there is huge demand for a low-cost and effective way of keeping in touch,' said a spokesman for ringo.co. 'However, a lot of us worry about whether or not we'll be calling our loved ones at an unpleasant hour and about the unknown expense of making long-distance calls. 'With the introduction of our live time zone and billing information, Ringo.co hopes to eliminate these worries and encourage people to keep in touch with friends and family as much as they'd like.'","Survey reveals 57 of Britons have friends of family members living abroad .

"Police snoopers are capturing phone data from tens of thousands of innocent people, allowing officers to listen to calls, block phone signal, and even send fake text messages, it has been claimed. Controversial ISMI catchers are being used by the Metropolitan Police, the country's largest force, to spy on suspects' mobile phones, according to reports. But the devices also 'hoover up' data from every other mobile within their range, meaning thousands of innocent people are being unintentionally targeted. The Metropolitan Police, the country's biggest force, use devices known as ISMI catchers to target criminals' mobiles, but the probes also 'hoover up' all phone data from the surrounding area . The devices are regularly used by the Met in large scale investigations, and are thought to be used by the National Crime Agency, according to The Times. For a mobile phone to work, it needs to transmit data between your handset and the nearest mobile phone mast, which will connect it to the rest of the network. IMSI catchers work by jumping into this stream of data, allowing the device to monitor everything that is sent between mobiles and a specific phone mast. Police will then be able to see a handset's IMSI - or International Mobile Subscriber Identity - along with the International Mobile Equipment Identifier (IMEI), allowing them to identify the owner. ISMI catchers then have the ability to monitor data sent to and from the handset, listen in to phone calls, block mobile signal, or send fake text message to or from the phone. As the devices are relatively new, their use is not covered by a specific law, and instead falls under the Police Act 1997 which is usually used to allow police to install bugs in someone's home. The use of such devices can be approved by an officer of chief constable rank, without the need for a judge or government minister to approve. Scotland Yard and the NCA have both refused to discuss when or why they use the devices, and what type of data they gather. Police numbers show that officers used 'property interference' techniques 2,689 times in the last year, but this data will include conventional bug microphones and other such devices. IMSI catchers allow officers to listen in to phone calls, block signal to a handset, read messages, and also send fake texts to and from the handset (posed by model) Matthew Rice, advocacy officer for Privacy International, told The Times: 'You cannot maintain this level of secrecy and claim that we still have policing by consent. 'This technology is not capable of targeting an individual. The latest IMSI catchers can unmask entire groups involved in protests, intercept all their messages and block all their calls.' A Scotland Yard spokesman told MailOnline that the force will neither confirm nor deny whether the equipment is used - or whether the force even has it. At the time of publishing, the National Crime Agency was unavailable for comment.","IMSI catchers mimic phone masts and intercept data sent from handsets .

"Former bikie boss Mahmoud 'Mick' Hawi has pleaded guilty to the fatal bashing of a rival associate at Sydney Airport five years ago. The 34-year-old Comanchero member appeared before the  NSW supreme court on Friday where he pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Hells Angels member Anthony Zervas who was beaten to death in 2009. Hawi was jailed for at least 21 years in 2012 for the murder but had his conviction quashed in May when the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal ordered that he be retried. Scroll down for video . Mick Hawi appeared in court where he pleaded guilty to bashing rival gang member Anthony Zervas . Former Comanchero bikie boss Mahmoud 'Mick' Hawi had his murder conviction quashed in May . The crown accepted Hawi's guilty plea  and he will now face sentencing on November 28. The 2009 brawl broke out between the bikie gangs after Hawi and his colleagues happened to be on the same Melbourne-to-Sydney flight as then-Hells Angels president Derek Wainohu. When Mr Zervas later attacked Hawi with scissors near check-in counters, the fighting broke out. Mr Zervas, 29, suffered massive head injuries after being attacked with bollards and kicked, punched and stomped on. Hawi was the only bikie convicted of Mr Zervas's murder, while 10 other Comancheros and two Hells Angels members either pleaded or were found guilty of other charges. Anthony Zervas died in 2009 when he was beaten to death at Sydney Airport . In sentencing Hawi in 2012, Justice Robert Allan Hulme said he was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the bikie boss inflicted any blows at all on Mr Zervas. But he said: 'His presence would undoubtedly have had the effect of authorising and approving the actions of the other man who bludgeoned Anthony Zervas to death.' After his successful appeal, Hawi sparked an outcry over changes to the state's bail laws in June when he was released from custody pending the retrial. Prosecutor Helen Roberts then told the court that the former bikie president still had ties to the organisation and posed an unacceptable risk to the community. Under his conditions of his bail, Hawi was to report to police daily and adhere to a curfew. He was not to associate with or contact certain people, not apply for a passport or go within a kilometre of an airport. The 34-year-old remains on bail.

"Six Victoria Crosses (VC) awarded to members of the Lancashire Fusiliers for their bravery at Gallipoli during World War One are set to be displayed together for the first time next year to commemorate 100 years since the famous victory. On the morning of April 25, 1915, one of the most courageous actions ever performed by the British armed forces took place at a beach close to Cape Helles on the Gallipoli Peninsula in Turkey. Collectively the six medals became known as the ‘six VCs before breakfast’ after they were awarded in recognition of the gallantry and bravery shown by the men of the 1st Battalion while many in Britain were still asleep. Six VCs awarded to members of the Lancashire Fusiliers, including Sgt Alfred Richards, left, and Cpl John Grimshaw, right, are set to be displayed together for the first time next year to commemorate 100 years since the victory at Gallipoli . Five of the VC meddles, including that awarded to Pte William Keneally, left, were relatively straight-forward to find but the sixth - belonging to Major Cuthbert Bromley, right - required a nationwide search by the Fusilier Museum in Bury . The Fusilier Museum in Bury hopes the collection of medals will form the centrepiece of an exhibition to be staged next April to mark the centenary of the Gallipoli landings. ‘It has never happened before. It will be the first time in 100 years that all six Victoria Crosses will be together,’ Sarah Stevenson, collections officer at the museum, told This Is Lancashire. While the museum already owns two of the VCs and has secured the loan of three others from Lord Ashcroft, the sixth medal required a nationwide search. Earlier this year the museum announced that it was desperate to find the VC awarded to Major Cuthbert Bromley, from Seaford in East Sussex, who had been temporarily promoted from captain and was wounded in the landing. The VC, which was awarded to Capt Richard Willis, left, is the highest military decoration awarded for valour 'in the face of the enemy' to members of British, Commonwealth and Empire armed forces . The last record the museum had of the VC was when it had been put up for auction in the late 1980s. The museum carried out extensive genealogy research to trace Major Bromley’s descendants, who still own the meddle and live in Bromley, Kent. They will visit the museum in December to discuss proposals to loan the VC for next year's exhibition. 'We are delighted to have found the missing medal. It’s taken a lot of time and effort but we are hopeful that all six will be united as part of our centenary exhibition for Gallipoli,' Col Brian Gorski, the museum's chairman told the Telegraph. The other five medals were awarded to Cpl John Grimshaw, Pte William Keneally, Sgt Alfred Richards, Sgt Frank Stubbs and Capt Richard Willis. The battle of Gallipoli saw the Lancashire Fusiliers experience heavy casualties with 11 officers and 350 men either killed or wounded . The battle of Gallipoli was launched by the allied forces to secure a sea route to Russia after they asked for assistance against the Turks. The landing at the beaches on the peninsula of Gallipoli saw the Lancashire Fusiliers experience heavy casualties with 11 officers and 350 men either killed or wounded. Another 400 brave fusiliers were left to overwhelm enemy defences and in the presence of such heroism, the Fusiliers were allotted six VCs and ordered to choose the recipients. The VC is the highest military decoration awarded for valour 'in the face of the enemy' to members of British, Commonwealth and Empire armed forces. The Lancashire Fusiliers have been awarded nineteen VCs, eighteen of which were awarded in the First World War, more than any other regiment in that conflict. Each year a Gallipoli Day march and church service is held in Bury to commemorate the soldiers’ heroism.","The Victoria Crosses were awarded to members of the 1st Battalion of the Lancashire Fusiliers for their bravery at Gallipoli during World War One .

"Astronomers have found the brightest ‘dead star’ ever recorded - but its very existence threatens to undermine our known laws of the universe. The pulsar - a dense and rapidly spinning remnant of a much larger star left over from a supernova explosion - has the energy of about 10 million suns and was previously thought to be a black hole. Its discovery, however, breaks a theoretical limit for how bright such an object can get - and it may also mean many other black holes found to date are actually pulsars. Scroll down for animations . Scientists at Nasa’s California Institute of Technology have found the brightest pulsar ever recorded. High-energy X-rays streaming from a rare and mighty pulsar (shown in magenta), the brightest found to date, can be seen in this  image of the Cigar Galaxy, also known as Messier 82 (M82) The discovery, published in the journal Nature, was made by scientists at Nasa’s California Institute of Technology (Caltech) using the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuStar). This pulsar was spotted while astronomers were observing the remnants of a once-in-a-century supernova dubbed SN2014J in the Cigar Galaxy, also known as Messier 82 (M82), 12 million light-years away. The rare event captured the attention of telescopes around the world including NuStar, and when astronomers looked at the data they found a huge source of X-rays coming from the region. When a massive star collapses and explodes as a supernova, its crushed core may survive as a compact remnant called a neutron star or pulsar. This is an object squeezing more mass than the sun's into a sphere the size of Washington DC. Young pulsars complete a revolution each second, while as they grow older they spin faster and faster, eventually completing thousands of revolutions a second. They generate beams of radio waves, visible light, X-rays and gamma rays that astronomers observe as pulses whenever the beams sweep past Earth. Pulsars also generate powerful outflows, or 'winds,' of high-energy particles moving near the speed of light. The power for all this comes from the pulsar's rapidly spinning magnetic field and over time, as the pulsars wind down, these emissions fade. More than 30 years ago, astronomers discovered another type of pulsar that completed revolutions in less than 10 milliseconds, reaching incredible rotational speeds of up to 43,000 revolutions per minute. This type of star is called a millsecond pulsar. While young pulsars usually appear in isolation, more than half of millisecond pulsars occur in binary systems with other stars, which suggests an explanation for their rapid spin. At first they thought it was a black hole but, examining the supernova, astronomers noticed pulses of bright X-rays occurring every 1.37 seconds. Blindingly bright X-rays like this are called ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) and they are normally associated with black holes. However, the discovery that this ULX was pulsing suggested it was something other than a black hole. By cross-examining the source with data from another telescope, Chandra, astronomers ruled out 25 other sources that it could have been. Finally, they realised that a pulsar must be the source - and it was revealed to be the brightest pulsar ever discovered. ‘That was a big surprise,’ said Dr Fiona Harrison, the principal investigator on NuStar. ‘For decades everybody has thought these ultraluminous X-ray sources had to be black holes. 'But black holes don't have a way to create this pulsing.’ She added: ‘This compact little stellar remnant is a real powerhouse. We've never seen anything quite like it.’ But the discovery has astronomers scratching their heads as, although fascinating, quite how something this bright can form is unknown. Pulsars are typically between one and two times the mass of the sun. This new pulsar falls in that same mass range, but shines about 100 times brighter than theory suggests something of its mass should be able to. ‘We've never seen a pulsar even close to being this bright,’ said Dom Walton, a postdoctoral scholar at Caltech who works with NuStar data. ‘Honestly, we don't know how this happens, and theorists will be chewing on it for a long time.’ A pulsar (illustration shown) is a rapidly spinning remnant of a larger star left after a supernova. They are as small as Washington DC but have the mass of the sun. But this pulsar is 100 times brighter than theory says should be possible. Astronomers previously though the object was a black hole. Credit: Nasa/JPL-Caltech . The discovery was made using Nasa's Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuStar), illustration shown. The telescope launched on 13 June 2012 and orbits the Earth at a height of about 340 miles (550km). It is used to focus high-energy X-rays from cosmic sources. Its mission is expected to end in 2016 . NuStar is particularly well-suited to make discoveries like this one. Not only does the space telescope see high-energy X-rays, but it sees them in a unique way. Rather than snapping images the way that your cell-phone camera does - by integrating the light such that images blur if you move - NuSTAR detects individual particles of X-ray light and marks when they are measured. That allows the team to do timing analyses and, in this case, to see that the light from the ULX was coming in pulses. The reason most astronomers had assumed black holes were powering these ULXs is that these X-ray sources are so incredibly bright. Black holes can be anywhere from 10 to billions of times the mass of the sun, making their gravitational pull much stronger than that of a pulsar. As matter falls onto the black hole the gravitational energy turns it to heat, which creates X-ray light. The bigger the black hole, the more energy there is to make the object shine. The discovery that this ULX is a pulsar is therefore baffling. It is many times brighter than the Eddington limit -  a basic physics guideline that sets an upper limit on the brightness that an object of a given mass should be able to achieve. The pulsar detected is shown in this animation that flips back and forth between images captured by Nasa's  NuSTAR. The animation was created by stacking  images taken both while the pulsar was 'on' and 'off,' meaning its beams were either pointed toward Earth or away from us and not visible. Credit: Nasa/JPL-Caltech . ‘This is the most extreme violation of that limit that we've ever seen,’ continued Mr Walton. ‘We have known that things can go above that by a small amount, but this blows that limit away.’ Now that the NuSTAR team has shown that this ULX is a pulsar, Dr Harrison points out that many other known ULXs may in fact be pulsars as well. 'Everybody had assumed all of these sources were black holes,' she said. 'Now I think people have to go back to the drawing board and decide whether that's really true. 'This could just be a very unique, strange object, or it could be that they're not that uncommon. We just don't know. We need more observations to see if other ULXs are pulsing.' Last month a scientist sensationally claimed it is impossible for black holes to exist, based on her mathematical calculations. The research was conducted by Professor Laura Mersini-Houghton from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the College of Arts and Scientists. She claimed that as a star dies, it releases a type of radiation known as Hawking radiation - predicted by Professor Stephen Hawking. However in this process, Professor Mersini-Houghton believes the star also sheds mass, so much so that it no longer has the density to become a black hole. Before the black hole can form, she said, the dying star swells and explodes. The singularity as predicted never forms, and neither does the event horizon - the boundary of the black hole where not even light can escape. ‘I’m still not over the shock,’ said Professor Mersini-Houghton. ‘We’ve been studying this problem for a more than 50 years and this solution gives us a lot to think about.’","Scientists at Nasa have discovered the brightest pulsar ever recorded .
A pulsar is a rapidly spinning remnant of a larger star left after a supernova .
They are the size of Washington DC but have the mass of the sun .
But this pulsar is 100 times brighter than theory states should be possible .
Astronomers previously thought the object was a black hole .
Its discovery suggests other objects in the universe, thought to be black holes, may also be pulsars ."
"Two of Ed Miliband's most senior frontbenchers today angrily denied plotting against him. Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham were forced to issue statements dismissing reports they were planning for a 'post-Miliband future'. The Labour party is in the grip of panic after Mr Miliband's personal ratings plunged, and his MPs fear hopes of election victory are slipping away. Face-off: Andy Burnham, left, has union backing, while Yvette Cooper, right, is the bookies' favourits . Ed Miliband attended the Stonewall Awards with Labour peer Lord Cashman last night, as speculation swirled about his future . Polls show Mr Miliband he is now less popular than every leader for 30 years who has taken their party to defeat in a general election, with 'depressed' Labour MPs fearing he will cost them victory in 2015. Even Gordon Brown's personal ratings were better six months before he too Labour to defeat. Several senior Labour figures now believe the party would be performing better with almost anyone else in charge. Last night Mr Miliband attended the Stonewall Awards in central London, which honoured Lord Cashman, a former Eastenders actor-turned Labour MEP. However, in another incident which will have Labour MPs groaning, Mr Miliband was also pictured awkwardly kissing former Coronation Street star Michelle Collins. Mr Miliband's fate appears to hinge on whether shadow ministers – some of whom are understood to have met privately to discuss his future – can agree on his fate and engineer a 'coronation' rather than a divisive leadership contest with an election only months away. The Times reported that Ms Cooper, the shadow home secretary, and Mr Burnham, the shadow education secretary, to have struck a 'non-aggression pact'. But a spokesman for  Ms Cooper said there was 'no foundation whatsoever' to the suggestion. 'The spreading of lies like this only damages the Labour Party and should be seen as exactly what it is - complete and utter garbage,' he said. 'Yvette, the shadow cabinet and the party are united behind Ed's leadership.' Shadow health secretary Mr Burnham said: 'The stories in today's newspapers are complete and pure fiction. There is not a shred of truth in them. 'What I think it's part of is a deliberate and desperate attempt to destabilise the Labour Party and to divide us. But I can say this: it won't work. We are a united team, we are united behind Ed.' He told Sky News: 'My focus is on the NHS, exposing the damage that this Government is doing and working hard to deliver the Labour government that this country needs and certainly that my constituency needs. 'That is where my focus is. I'm working hard to support Ed Miliband in every single way I can.' Mr Miliband also met former Coronation Street star Michelle Collins at the party, where he was pictured awkwardly kissing the actress . At the Labour conference in September, Mr Miliband's wife Justine appeared to duck away as he leant in for a kiss after his speech . However, the denials will only fuel speculation about what - if anything - will be done to bolster or remove Mr Miliband. The Labour leader sought to dismiss talk of a leadership coup as 'nonsense' yesterday, as he visited Northampton to talk about buses. He later told the BBC: 'I don't accept that this matter arises. I believe that what the party wants to focus on is the country.' Analysis of IpsosMORI polling dating back to 1977 by MailOnline shows how only Michael Foot had worse personal satisfaction ratings than Ed Miliband six months before a general election . Former Labour Cabinet minister Peter Hain (left) dismissed the leadership crisis as Westminster bubble nonsense' but shadow attorney general Emily Thornberry criticised Mr Miliband's conference speech in which he forgot to mention the deficit . Critics point to Mr Miliband's disastrous party conference speech, which he delivered without notes and forgot to mention the deficit or immigration. Shadow attorney general Emily Thornberry today said she would not have attempted to deliver a speech of such importance without notes, but insisted Mr Miliband had kept Labour 'united' and would make a great prime minister. She said: 'He made a mistake making a speech ... that makes someone a human being. He is not an automaton. 'It was an hour-long speech. Frankly, I would not have tried to make a 15-minute speech of that importance without notes, but he has been doing it and he made a mistake.' But she told LBC Radio: 'I think that he is immensely talented, he is a very nice man, he is a deep thinker, he has kept the Labour Party united, he is a man with lots of ideas and he would be a great prime prime minister.' Last night Labour's election co-ordinator Douglas Alexander issued a plea for the party to 'pull together', warning: 'Divided parties lose elections.' He told BBC1's Question Time: 'He's got challenges, but all of us have got challenges in every political party. 'Every one of us in the Labour Party has to reflect the reality that divided parties lose elections and we have got a profound responsibility to the people who want to get away from the mistakes, the errors, the sheer injustice of this coalition government to pull together, to offer credible change in the face of these tough economic times, and that's exactly what we plan to do.' Former cabinet minister David Blunkett sought to calm the atmosphere, calling for an end to 'this bout of political insanity'. 'When you are standing on the edge of a cliff it is unwise to believe that by jumping you will suddenly learn to fly,' he told The Guardian. Former Labour Cabinet minister Peter Hain claimed it was 'Westminster bubble nonsense' which is a 'world completely remote from what is happening out there'. However New Statesman magazine, which backed Mr Miliband as leader, accused him of being too remote from ordinary people. Its editor Jason Cowley said Mr Miliband appeared 'very much an old-style Hampstead socialist'. 'He doesn't really understand the lower middle-class or material aspiration,' he writes. 'He doesn't understand Essex Man or Woman. Politics for him must seem at times like an extended PPE seminar: elevated talk about political economy and the good society.' Writing on the Politics Home website, shadow business secretary Mr Umunna said the rumblings were 'nonsense which some in the Westminster bubble want to distract us with'. Mr Umunna added: 'The simple fact is that because of Ed Miliband's leadership we are now within touching distance of being what many thought impossible four years ago. 'We have a leader who has kept us united and overseen the renewal which so eluded us at the end of our time in government. Ed is an honest, sincere man of deep beliefs.' The runners who are lining up to replace Ed Miliband... Ruled himself out: Popular former postman Alan Johnson said he had no appetite for the frontbench . Ed Miliband's position is made easier by the fact that none of his potential rivals has declared their hand. Many MPs want Alan Johnson, the popular former postman, to throw his hat into the ring – saying he has much greater appeal with voters than the awkward Mr Miliband. But Mr Johnson, who served as Home Secretary under Gordon Brown, has all but ruled himself out, claiming last month that he had 'no appetite for being on the frontbench'. His refusal to put himself forward will force any plotters to look elsewhere. It seems the succession would come down to a face-off between shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary. The bookies are increasingly throwing their weight behind Mr Burnham, who made a well-received speech on the NHS at September's Labour conference – in marked contrast to Mr Miliband's famously poor effort. It is reported that, emboldened by his conference success, he is already canvassing support; particularly in the North West. Ladbrokes yesterday cut Mr Burnham's chances of leading the party from 6/1 into 4/1 to be the next party leader, as more and more political punters back him. The former health secretary has also gained the support of militant union leader Len McCluskey who said last month Mr Burnham is the person who 'most impresses' him on the Labour frontbench. However, Miss Cooper is still favourite to take over if Mr Miliband goes; attracting odds of 7/2. She can at least count on the support of her husband, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, who is unlikely to have much chance of victory on his own. Mr Johnson is further down the betting pecking order on 12/1. If none of these decide to stand, it could be left to younger frontbenchers such as Chuka Umunna (8/1), with Rachel Reeves and Tristram Hunt outside bets on 16/1. The man who Labour MPs and party members wanted to be leader – David Miliband – has odds of 20/1. But there is no chance of him taking the reins from his brother because he has stepped down as an MP and moved to the US. ... But the rules mean it is impossible . Party rules say that to force out the leader, a vote of no-confidence has to be called – and the only way for that to happen is a card vote at the party's annual conference. No such move was made at the last Labour conference six weeks ago in Manchester and none is scheduled before May's election. So it seems that those dissatisfied with Ed Miliband's leadership have missed their chance to force him out. Their only hope is that the pressure becomes so intolerable that he decides to step down for the good of the party. This could happen if, for example, a large number of MPs say publicly they want him to go. In that case, other candidates would be able to put themselves forward. To become a candidate, an MP needs the support of 15 per cent of the parliamentary party – or 39 of Labour's current 257 MPs. The voting rules in a leadership contest were changed in March to a one member, one vote system for MPs, MEPs, party members and affiliated union members.","Shadow home secretary and shadow health secretary issue statements .

"Shocking video shows the moment a driver smashed into an oncoming car. Helmet camera footage captured by the 20-year-old driver in Adelaide shows him colliding with a vehicle head on, sending him flying over the handlebars of his Kawasaki Ninja 300 and into the path of oncoming traffic. Scroll down for video . A Dashcam image of an Adelaide motorbike driver shows the moment before it smashes into an oncoming car . The 20-year-old-driver was flung onto the road headfirst, suffering damage to the ligament in his knee . He can be heard swearing as he hurtles towards the red car and smashes into it . The risks associated with riding motor bike are illustrated in the Adelaide driver's helmet camera footage, which shows him riding along a road and losing control of his bike within seconds. He can be heard swearing as he hurtles towards an oncoming red car and smashes into it. The motorbike rider flips over and lands on the ground with a grunt, and the car he smashed into is seen pulling up nearby. The camera attached to the driver's helmet drops to face the ground and the 20-year-old, clearly in shock, breathes deeply. A bystander who happens to be a doctor gets out of another car and comes to the aid of the man almost immediately. The woman asks the man to lie on his back without moving his neck, and asks if he is injured. The 20-year-old says he has hurt his knee and asks to be moved off the road, away from danger of other cars. The description of the video says the bike, a Ninja 300, was 'written off as unrepairable' after the collision . A Ninja 300.

"The suspect in a deadly ambush on two state troopers said in a text message that 'all is good' less than five hours before he allegedly opened fire outside their barracks in northeastern Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains, according to court documents. Eric Frein's longtime friend received a text from the suspect around 6.15pm on Sept. 12, The Times-Tribune of Scranton reported Saturday, citing a search warrant affidavit filed in the case. Frein is charged with ambushing the Blooming Grove barracks shortly before 11pm that night. One trooper was shot dead and a second seriously wounded. Authorities have been looking for Frein - described by authorities as a survivalist with a grudge against law enforcement - in the woods around his parents' home in Canadensis since the attack. The manhunt entered its fourth week on Saturday. Scroll down for video . Most wanted: Eric Frein is accused of killing Cpl. Bryon Dickson and seriously wounding Trooper Alex Douglass four weeks ago. Court documents show he sent a text saying 'All is good' to a friend less than five hours before the shooting . Campsite: This recent photo released by Pennsylvania State Police on Friday shows a campsite near Canadensis, Pennsylvania, that officials say was used by suspected killer Eric Frein . Search: Hundreds of law enforcement officers have joined the search for Frein through the rugged woods . Authorities said Friday they have found caches of supplies in the rugged, heavily wooded search area. Tuna fish, ramen noodles and other food was recovered along with clothing and 90 rounds of ammunition from a campsite where police previously said they found two pipe bombs, according to investigators. 'Because we continue to push Frein, and to seize the items he needs to survive, we believe he will be forced to search for food and shelters in other locations,' said Bivens, who gave an update on the manhunt three weeks after the shooting that killed Cpl. Bryon Dickson and seriously wounded Trooper Alex Douglass. Court documents said Frein's wrote in his text message that he had stayed at the friend's apartment in East Stroudsburg the previous night. The friend was in Virginia at the time of the shooting, the affidavit said. Frein's text also said he was ""heading back to Delaware,"" and that he would return the following week, the affidavit said. Police have said Frein lied to relatives and other people that he was working in Delaware so he could prepare for the ambush. Police obtained a search warrant for the apartment and recovered several boxes of ammunition and 10 dirty gun-cleaning patches, according to a document listing the items seized by police. The friend is not charged in connection with the ambush and police have said Frein acted alone. DNA testing, meanwhile, was inconclusive on soiled diapers thought to have been left by Frein, the FBI said Friday. The diapers had been exposed to the elements, so 'you can't say one way or the other' whether Frein wore them, Edward Hanko, special agent in charge of the Philadelphia FBI office, said in a phone interview. State police announced last week they had discovered diapers in the northeastern Pennsylvania woods where Frein is believed to be hiding, and that he might have worn them so he could remain stationary for long periods of time. The diapers might have belonged to Frein, but the testing didn't confirm it or rule it out, Hanko said. Investigation: Authorities believe they have spotted Frein from a distance, but the rough terrain made it impossible to get to him . Frein has been described as an anti-law enforcement survivalist and expert marksman at home in the woods. He's considered armed and dangerous . Have you seen this man? A wanted poster of suspected killer Eric Frein is posted at an entrance to a trail in the woods on Thursday in Barrett Township near Canadensis, Pennyslvania . Bivens said the diapers are still considered evidence in the case. He declined further comment. The manhunt is concentrated on a heavily forested area in the Pocono Mountains. Authorities believe they have spotted Frein from a distance, but the rough terrain made it impossible to get to him. The last sighting deemed highly credible came earlier in the week, Bivens said. Frein has been described as an anti-law enforcement survivalist and expert marksman at home in the woods. He's considered armed and dangerous. Even as the manhunt entered its fourth week, police said they remain confident Frein will be caught. 'It's just a matter of time for him,' said Trooper Ryan Lawrence, who spent five days in the search zone. 'The commissioner down to every road trooper has the same resolve.' Lawrence, who worked a 12-hour overnight shift on road and perimeter patrol, said the possibility that Frein was lurking somewhere nearby was never far from his mind. 'You definitely have to stay within a tactical mindset, just so you're not opening yourself up for a possible attack, at least limiting the possibility of making yourself a target,' Lawrence said Friday. The trooper would keep himself out of the glare cast by his car's headlights, for instance, giving him the ability to observe but not easily be observed. Lawrence lives in Lancaster, about 100 miles from the search area. Troopers throughout Pennsylvania are signing up to search for Frein, he said. 'The driving force is obviously for the family of Cpl. Bryon Dickson. It's a commonly spoken thing while there, you are doing it for him and his family,' Lawrence said. 'There's a wife and two sons who aren't able to have their state trooper come home, and that's a driving force for a lot of our guys up there.' Pennsylvania state police have been joined by law enforcement officials from New York and New Jersey state police, the FBI, the U.S. Marshals Service and other federal agencies. The FBI alone has 140 to nearly 200 of its staff in the field each day, Hanko said, including agents, analysts, technicians, three full SWAT teams and members of a hostage rescue team. Frein is not living off the land, Hanko said, but surviving on supplies he brought with him into the woods. 'He'll be located,' Hanko said. 'All our intel, and all of our analysis, and the sightings, and the items we've recovered that have been recently used tell us he's there.'","Eric Frein, 31, sent the text less than five hours before allegedly opening fire on the troopers in rural Pennsylvania on September 12 .

"A cyclist was killed after he was hit by two cars within 15 minutes because both drivers were 'blinded' by the sun, a court heard. Stan Coates, 55, was injured but alive and conscious after he was hit by Michael Elton's black Corsa on Burdon Lane in Sunderland. He was able to speak to the emergency services about his sore wrist and knee as he sat by the roadside waiting for an ambulance in October 2012. Michael Elton, 25, (left) and Edward Peverley, 21, (right) both denied causing death by careless driving at Newcastle Crown Court after their cars ploughed into cyclist Stan Coates, 55, within 15 minutes of each other . But within minutes of being struck, he was hit by a white Corsa driven by Edward Peverley and dragged along the road, Newcastle Crown Court heard. Mr Coates from West Herrington died in hospital from multiple fractures and injuries in the early hours of the following morning. Prosecutors claim both drivers were 'blinded' by the sun when they hit Mr Coates and had not taken appropriate steps to make driving in such conditions safe. Michael Hodson, prosecuting, said: 'The crown's case is they should have slowed down, far below the speed they continued to travel at, you may think to a crawl, with hazard lights on. 'What they should not have down was what both did.' Investigators estimate Elton may have been travelling at up to 50mph and Peverley at less than 40mph. Prosecutors claim both drivers were 'blinded' by the sun when they hit Mr Coates on Burdon Lane, Sunderland . Elton, 25, from Durham and Peverley, 21, from Tyne And Wear, both deny causing death by careless driving. Both drivers stopped at the scene when they realised they had had been in accidents. The court heard that despite Mr Coates surviving the first collision, prosecutors say both drivers are to blame for his death. Mr Hodson told jurors: 'Elton's careless driving knocked Mr Coates down into the road, which was the reason why Peverley hit him. 'Mr Elton's careless driving has therefore contributed, in more than a minimal way, to the death of Mr Coates. 'He was driving too fast at the time when he knew he couldn't see the road ahead. 'It is obvious, the Crown say, is it not, that a fatal accident might occur in those circumstances and he is then guilty. 'Peverley was driving too fast when he couldn't see the road ahead. 'If you are sure he was driving carelessly, he has contributed more than slightly to the death and is guilty of causing death by careless driving.' The trial continues.

"A mother-of-six who was beaten, bound and stabbed while being kept prisoner by her estranged husband feared he would behead her during the three day ordeal. June Churchill was held hostage by David Churchill after he burst into their marital home wielding an axe and armed with a bag of cable ties to keep her prisoner. He kept her in the house for three days, slashing her throat and even sending text messages to her children pretending to be her, before he set fire to their Merseyside home.

Mrs Churchill described being bound to the bed with cable ties and her estranged husband standing over her, an axe in his hand, saying 'OK, we can do it the easy way - or the hard way.' Mrs Churchill was bound to the bed with cable ties during the ordeal . He then stabbed her in the chest with the axe, leaving a gaping four-inch wound. After reeling off a 'shopping list' of the harm he was to inflict on his estranged wife Churchill then moved her into the bathroom where he slashed her neck. After pleading with Churchill to stop, June was moved back to the bedroom and had her wounds patched up with T-shirts in an attempt to stem the bleeding. He used her phone to send messages to her children reassuring them she was OK. In the early hours of October 3 she was then moved downstairs and into a waiting taxi. Churchill, who has a history of violence, covered the house in white spirit and then set fire to it. He drove the 52-year-old to the Royal Liverpool hospital, dropping her off outside and warning her not to tell anyone about what had happened. Just a day before he burst into the marital home Churchill had been bailed by magistrates after he was arrested by police for grabbing his wife by the throat, holding her in a headlock, strangling her and punching her in the face. Mrs Churchill's daughter Rachel, 25, said: 'The doctors said it was one of the worst cases they'd ever seen. They couldn't believe she actually survived. 'She had two black eyes, six deep wounds to her chest, neck and arm, her skull and chest bone were fractured. It's remarkable the recovery she's made.' At a hearing at Liverpool Crown Court Churchill admitted assault, wounding with intent and unlawful imprisonment. He also admitted arson with intent to endanger lives and has been warned he faced a prison sentence. Insurers refused to pay out after her estranged husband burned down their marital home in Maghull, Liverpool . Mr Churchill doused the house in white spirit before he set fire to it and dropped off his wife at the hospital . Insurers have since agreed to pay £5,000 as a 'goodwill gesture' after the £230,000 house was torched . Mrs Churchill, who is now being looked after by her daughter at a house in Tuebrook, said she now wants to stop other women becoming victims of domestic violence. She said: 'In a macabre sort of way, he doesn't realise what he has given me. 'He's given me purpose, because I will make sure what I've been through never happens to anyone else. 'I'm just so lucky I am alive.' And in a final bitter blow she has lost her £230,000 semi-detached home as her insurers refused her claim for the house and £15,000 worth of contents because the fire had been started by her husband, who lived at the property in Maghull in Merseyside. Esure initially refused to pay out 'on account of Mr Churchill deliberately setting fire to his own property. The company has now offered a 'goodwill gesture' of £5,000, the Daily Mirror reported.

"Did SHE or didn’t she? Will she or won’t she? Has she or hasn’t she? And most pertinent of all, most damnably crucial of all, is she or is she not guilty? On Wednesday night, as the last episode in the second series of BBC2’s police corruption drama Line Of Duty is shown, millions of  television viewers will finally find out the truth about the mysterious Detective Inspector Lindsay Denton. Is the beleaguered cop, so brilliantly played by Keeley Hawes, really a force for good; an honourable and decent woman trying to do her best in a quagmire of police corruption? Millions of viewers will finally find out the truth about the mysterious Detective Inspector Lindsay Denton played by Keeley Hawes . Or is she just another crazy bunny boiler seeking revenge on the senior officer with whom she had an affair? The question has certainly set the deerstalkers a-twirling on the heads of the armchair Sherlocks at home, desperately trying to work out Denton’s innocence — or otherwise. And after five 60-minute episodes of the most tightly-plotted and nerve-shredding drama seen on British television in years, we still don’t have a clue. As the bodies continue to pile up, Line Of Duty has been the most talked-about cop show since last year’s Broadchurch on ITV (the story of a child killed in a Dorset seaside town) — and no wonder. Detective Sergeant Steve Arnott played by Martin Compston (left) and Detective Constable Kate Fleming played by Vicky McClure (right) Television critics and fans alike are showering Line Of Duty with praise, most describing it as the best television series of the year so far, some even calling it the best police drama ever made. Certainly, this taut, nasty, unpredictable whodunit proves that the BBC — when it puts its mind to it — can make big, powerful, smash-hit dramas that are just as good as anything produced by American companies, with their limitless budgets, resources and deployment of Hollywood talent. Deputy Chief Constable Michael Dryden played by Mark Bonnar . Written by Jed Mercurio (his previous work includes medical drama Cardiac Arrest) and blessed with a flawless cast, the show has lured viewers into a world of police-on-police murder which is often genuinely shocking, quietly horrifying and deeply thought-provoking. Corpses have their fingerprints burned off to avoid identification, while rivalries between police departments in the same force threaten to bury justice in a welter of internecine politicking. Filmed in Belfast last year, Line Of Duty is set within a fictitious English force, but Mercurio used (anonymous) serving police officers as consultants. The result is an authentic atmosphere and a series which depicts the complicated realities of modern police work with an unflinching eye. At a time when the real-life Metropolitan Police are once more under fire and facing allegations of rogue operations and corruption (in the investigation into the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence and others), here is a cop show not afraid to sizzle with intelligence and the unmistakeable imprimatur of red hot realism. It reflects a world in which the dividing line between righteousness and evil, between the goodies and the baddies, has never been so mutable. Twenty-five years after the Hillsborough disaster, questions about police conduct and the subsequent cover-up of events on that day are still being asked. And then there was so-called Plebgate, after which it emerged that a serving officer lied about an altercation with the Government Chief Whip at the gates of Downing Street. Superintendent Ted Hastings (Adrian Dunbar), Detective Sergeant Steve Arnott (Martin Compston) and Detective Constable Kate Fleming (Vicky McClure) The moral ambiguity of the force and the question of who can and who cannot be trusted, in or out of uniform, has never been more pertinent. Over the past five tension-ratcheting weeks, DI Denton has been the prime suspect in an intricate web of crime. The central mystery is who plotted an ambush on a police convoy, killing the protected witness they were transporting to safety and the three officers accompanying him. Since then, there have been two more police deaths; one detective was thrown through the window of a hospital, another was battered with a monkey wrench. Denton has been arrested on suspicion of murder and while in prison, had her hands crushed and then scalded with boiling water . Linked to all this is the murder of a teenage runaway and the fact that Denton once had an affair with the big boss, Assistant Chief Constable Mike Dryden (played by Mark Bonnar who is also superb, with very emotive nostrils). So far, so very, very bleak. As the quest for justice lurches on, piano-playing Denton has been arrested on suspicion of murder and while in prison, had her hands crushed and then scalded with boiling water. She has also had her head shoved down a toilet (by the cops in her own station) and had excrement smuggled into her prison porridge. Hardly a glamorous role for 38-year-old Hawes, known for her natural gloss and polished performances in series such as Spooks and Ashes To Ashes. Here, she is dowdy to the point of despair; a woman who cuts her own fringe, wears yesterday’s mascara and throws on clothes that appear to be made of cast-off potato sacks. It goes without saying that she is a peerless detective, possessed of ratlike cunning and strong survival instincts. Indeed, not since Helen Mirren first played DCI Jane Tennison back in Prime Suspect in the early Nineties has such a fascinating and complex female police officer been created for television. Left to right: Detective Sergeant Manish Prasad played by Sacha Dawan and Detective Inspector Lindsay Denton played by Keeley Hawes . Yes, Broadchurch had the wonderful DS Ellie Miller (Olivia Colman), while Scott & Bailey continue to ply their trade on ITV. In recent years, however, it is Scandinavian dramas which have led the way in creating iconoclastic, mould-breaking policewomen such as Sarah Lund and her woolly jumpers in The Killing and the alarmingly direct Saga Noren in The Bridge. Now it is DI Denton, beaten up but not beaten, who is more than a match for all these top she-cops. With only the tiniest emotion occasionally washing across her bare face, she gives nothing away. Behind the thin blue line, who is guilty and who is innocent? As internet chat-rooms boil with speculation and more than three million BBC viewers have their own theories, it is interesting that no Line Of Duty character, within the anti-corruption squad or out of it, is wholly good or bad. Each and every officer is tainted in some way, although some are more crippled by their flaws than others. DI Denton has money worries, a difficult past and a tendency towards violence. Miss Marple she is not. ‘People have underestimated me my whole life,’ she tells DC Kate Fleming (Vicky McClure) before punching her in the stomach. A car in a police convoy is set alight by a masked person in the Line of Duty which comes to an end this week . Fleming was having an affair with the husband of the policewoman killed in the ambush, a fact known to colleague DS Steve Arnott (Martin Compston) who sleeps with every attractive female in sight. Superintendent Ted Hastings (Adrian Dunbar) also has money worries and a broken marriage. Promised a promotion by Dryden, he has been reluctant to explore avenues in the investigation that might clear Denton and implicate his protector within the force. Viewers have lapped up all this moral ambiguity — not to mention the excellent writing, terrific acting and a complicated plotline that does not treat them like idiots. Last week, the questioning under caution of Dryden by anti-corruption officers Arnott and Fleming went on for nearly 18 minutes of heart-stopping drama. Cocky and threatening at first, Dryden’s nostrils went into terrifying overdrive as the evidence mounted up. Out on bail and back in her empty flat, the faintest spectre of a smirk flitted across Denton’s face as she watched a report of Dryden’s arrest on the news. Earlier she had forced a confession out of a detective by crushing him against a wall with a car. Bunny boiler or brilliant bobby? We’ll have to wait until Wednesday to find out.","Millions set to find out the truth about Detective Inspector Lindsay Denton .

"Long suffering victims of hayfever may soon be breathing a sign of relief after it was revealed trials are under-way to inject trees with hormones to reduce allergens. Melbourne City Council are carrying out the tests on 18 London Plane trees in the busy cafe area of Lygon Street for the second year running. Last year hormones were injected into the trunks of the trees but it didn't seem to make any difference. The London Plane trees are causing problems for customers wanting to stop for a coffee in Lygon Street . About three quarters of Melbourne's trees are London Planes and the council is now carrying out tests to try and reduce their allergins . These are the seed pods the council hope the hormones will help stop to produce . Now the hormones have been injected into the tree soil and sprayed over the canopy. Traders have welcomed the move and said 'something has to be done' because the pollen problem is getting worse. It is hoped the hormone injections will stop the trees from producing seed pods, which are often blamed for causing nasal, throat and eye irritations for annoyed customers. Customers of coffee shops in Lygon Street have long complained of the pollen in Lygon Street . Traders have welcomed the move and said 'something has to be done' because the pollen problem is getting worse . Marco Riggio, manager of Grinders Coffee in Lygon Street, says he suffers very badly from hayfever and would welcome any solution to the problem. The 30-year-old told Daily Mail Australia: 'The pollen problem is really bad round here and lots of customers who don't sit down in the seated areas because the pollen is just everywhere. 'I have seen customers sneezing outside and lots of them relate it back to the trees. Robert Doyle, Melbourne Lord Mayor said: 'It's a well known technique for orchardists and nut farmers to control the blossoming and flowering and the seeding of their trees' Last year Melbourne City Council trialled injecting the hormones into the tree trunks but it didn't work . 'There isn't a day that goes by that me and my staff have not sneezed ten times in the morning because of the pollen. 'It is because of the type of trees down here that is it so bad. 'I have got really bad sinus problems and would welcome anything to try and solve it.' The council is now trying to inject the hormones into the soil and spray it over the canopy of the trees . Traders say the trial is 'long overdue' and the problem is just 'getting worse' Mr Riggio said he often joked about the pollen problem with the manager of neighbouring coffee shop Cafe Lobello. He said: 'The owner often says it's a problem and it is annoying for him because he has sit down customers outside.' Paul Ferraro, 45, one of the partners in University Cafe which has 56 outdoor seats for customers said: 'The pollen gets on the seats, sugars, in the coffee and it even gets stuck in your throat. 'This was the wrong choice of trees for this area. I think the trial is a fantastic idea because some people can't breathe, it is a serious problem. 'The pollen is pretty bad from the middle of September to the end of November. 'I am very glad because it is long due, the pollen wasn't bad when the trees were babies but it is getting worse.' Robert Doyle, Melbourne Lord Mayor, told 9News: 'It's a well known technique for orchardists and nut farmers to control the blossoming and flowering and the seeding of their trees. 'We can't spray ours from overhead like they can but we are going to experiment to see if we can without harming trees reduce the amount of seed debris.' Melbourne City Council's landscape manager, Ian Shears, told 774 ABC Melbourne: 'If you look around the [CBD] around 75 percent of the trees are London planes, and Lygon Street in the cafe strip in particular is where probably most of the concerns from the community come from. 'They want to enjoy their cappuccinos just with milk froth rather than anything else on top of it, I think.'","Pollen from London Plane trees is causing a nightmare for coffee traders and customers in Melbourne's CBD .

"When it comes to hitting the road, they do it together, bringing smiles wherever they travel. Moki, a five-year-old Goldendoodle – a cross between a golden retriever and a standard poodle – sits behind his owner Brad Bakalar, from Reno, Nevada aboard his beloved Harley-Davidson motorcycle. The pair have been getting a lot of attention on YouTube as the pair travel across the country, making Moki one of the most photographed dogs in America. Scroll down for video . Moki has become something of an internet sensation, featured on YouTube as he rides on the back of Brad Bakelar's Harley . Brad and Moki often go for long drives in the country along with wife Marti who can be seen in the background . Brad picked up Moki as he was wandering the streets of Arizona. The pooch weighed just 16 pounds at the time . Moki seems to love just hopping onto Brad's Harley and hitching a ride whether its along country roads or along the Interstate . Me and my buddy: Moki has become something of an internet sensation . Trusted companion: Moki puts his paws around Brad as they stop at traffic lights . In one of the more memorable moments, the video shows him riding down I-580 on the passenger seat of Brad's Harley. The video went viral appearing on countless  sites. Moki appears to be well-loved by his owner which is a huge turnaround in fortunes for the pooch who was found abandoned and starving when he and the Bakelars found each other in Page, Arizona. 'About five years ago, I was helping some friends in a boat shop,' said Brad to the Reno Gazette-Journal. 'It's a small town and they had a little animal rescue that they ran out of the shop. Some folks called and said there was a little dog wandering this apartment complex for two weeks and he was starving to death. Getting all the attention: Bra'ds wife Marti (right) now has to ride her own bike instead of riding pillion behind Brad - all thanks to Moki who takes up her old space! Moki brings smiles wherever he goes and has been known to spark spontaneous, paparazzi-like photo ops . On more than one occasion – the most recent being Pinocchio's Ride for the Tatas breast cancer fundraiser in Virginia City – Bakelar and Moki have sat on the motorcycle getting the attention and raising money . Holding on! Unlike other celebrities, Moki will work for belly rubs, treats and, especially, motorcycle rides . The minute he got into the shop, he ran in, leaned against my leg and kind of adopted me. I called my wife and said, 'You'd better set another place for dinner because we've got a new family member.' When he was first picked up, he looked nothing like how he does now. He was tso thin, his ribs were showing and his fur was dirty and matted, weighing just 16 pounds. Now he is closer to 70. His new found friend came to work with him, where Brad works as a mechanic. It became apparent that Moki enjoyed riding around. 'I would move boats around with the forklift and wherever I would go, he would go,' Brad said. 'He just jumped on and started riding around with me. That segued into this little ATV 4-wheeler we had at the shop. He jumped on there with me.' When Brad got his Harley out, Moki jumped on board. Like his owner, Moki wears eye protection while they ride and most of their trips are 150 miles or less at a time . One big happy family: Marti ended up having to get her own bike after Moki took her place on Brad's bike! Holding on: Moki clings to Brad as the pair cruise effortlessly down the Interstate . 'He got excited and I said, 'Get on or get run over and he ran up my knee into the back seat and has pretty much been there ever since.' The pair have been riding the roads together since 2009 and covered nearly 40,000 miles together. Moki hops on board the Harley, straps on his eye protection and the duo hit the road. Most trips are around 150 miles or less, after which the Goldendoodle wants feels ready to take a nap. Once thing is certain, wherever the pair travel, people always want to get their photo's taken with the duo. Over the summer, Brad found that Moki also enjoys riding on the back of a jet ski, sitting comfortably behind him once again. Brad Bakelar said that it is all in good taste and has become something of a labor of love. 'It's something that he and I do because we like doing it,' he said. 'It's not something I'm trying to make money off of. I'm not going to turn him into Lassie. I don't want it to become something that I dread doing. It's fun that people notice and enjoy him. In addition to the motorcycle, Moki apparently also enjoys riding on the back of of a jet ski, sitting comfortably behind his owner, Brad, who says the whole thing has now become a labor of love .","Moki, a five-year-old Goldendoodle, sits comfortably in the backseat of Brad Bakalar's Harley Davidson ."
"Television viewers have become more tolerant of violence and swearing, the head of Ofcom has claimed. But the sexist or racist language of the 1970s is far less acceptable than it once was, research by the broadcasting regulator reveals. Ofcom’s chief executive Ed Richards, who is about to stand down after 11 years in the job, told MPs there has been a big change in tolerance levels in the past few decades. Ofcom chief says the British public has grown more tolerant - but still does not like discriminatory language on TV shows. Till Death Us Do Part, which frequently had lead character Alf Garnett making racist remarks . But critics argued the British public has simply become ‘desensitised’ to swearing after years of lax regulation by Ofcom. According to the regulator’s latest research, published in July, only 35 per cent of viewers think there is too much violence on TV, down from 55 per cent in 2008. Just 35 per cent think there is too much swearing, down from 53 per cent six years ago, while 26 per cent believe there is too much sex, a slight rise from 25 per cent. ‘There has been a big change in this over the years,’ Mr Richards told the Commons culture, media and sport committee. ‘People are more tolerant of a degree of violence than they were. They are much more tolerant of certain forms of swearing than they were. ‘There are still some words – very few to be honest – but still some words which are off limits or only in certain circumstances. ‘They are much less tolerant, interestingly enough, of language which is regarded as discriminatory or unfair or unjust towards people. That’s a big change if you think of the Seventies and some of the programmes which went out then. The public just do not want to see that any more.’ TV shows such as Till Death Us Do Part, which ran from 1965 to 1975, had lead character Alf Garnett frequently making racist remarks. A string of shows – such as The Thick Of It (pictured) – have been accused of needlessly turning the airwaves blue, leaning to accusations that the public is 'desensitised' to swearing . In recent years a number of TV comedians have come under fire for littering their routines with swear words. And a string of shows – such as The Thick Of It and Mrs Brown’s Boys – have been accused of needlessly turning the airwaves blue. Vivienne Pattison, the director of campaign group Mediawatch-UK, said that if it was true that viewers were less concerned by bad language it was simply because they had become ‘desensitised’ to it. Mediawatch-UK recently conducted a similar survey in which more than 2,000 viewers were asked whether they had seen inappropriate material broadcast before the 9pm watershed. Miss Pattison said all of those surveyed said they had, but only 26 per cent had complained about it. She said: ‘It is not true to say that people are more tolerant about bad language, sex or violence on screen. What has happened is that they have now lost faith in the ability of Ofcom to do anything about it so they have stopped even complaining.’ One of the MPs who quizzed Mr Richards, former Labour Culture Secretary Ben Bradshaw, said he felt UK broadcasters are now too intolerant of nudity while being willing to accept violence and sex on screen. However, Mr Richards denied that British television has become more ‘prudish’ about nudity and was ‘importing American values and morality’.","Ofcom's chief executive said there had been a big change in tolerance levels .

A Qatari doctor who conducted Gloria's autopsy found that the child's hips, ribs and spine protruded and concluded the cause of death was dehydration and wasting disease. The case has raised concerns about possible cultural misunderstandings in Qatar, where Western-style adoptions and cross-cultural families are relatively rare. An investigative report by Qatari police had raised questions about why the Huangs would adopt children who did not share their 'hereditary traits' and raised concerns that the children were part of a human trafficking operation or were 'bought' for organ harvesting, according to the family's website. The Huangs, of Asian descent, have two other African-born adopted children who left Qatar during the trial to live with relatives in the U.S. Matthew Huang described the allegations as 'ridiculous' and called on President Barack Obama to explain to the ruler of Qatar 'why American families adopt high-need children.' Gloria, who was severely malnourished in early childhood, would periodically refuse food for several days and then binge eat or get food from bizarre sources, such as garbage cans or from strangers - a behavior her parents traced to her impoverished upbringing and were trying to address. She would also try to leave the house at night in search of food and pick through the medicine cabinet on late-night binges, according to a report prepared last year in the U.S. by Janice Ophoven, a pediatric forensic pathologist who reviewed the case for the family .

"A Pennsylvania felon who fired a handgun into his neighbor's house told the judge at his arraignment it was because he didn't know how to unload a handgun. George Byrd IV, 31, was hauled in front of a judge Friday after police found a handgun and a few rounds of ammunition in Byrd's home following a call that shots were fired into a neighbor's house. The Bucks County Courier Times reports that a Middletown resident called police around 12:30 p.m. Friday after hearing gunshots. Pleading ignorance: George Byrd IV, 31, was found shirtless at his home after a neighbor charged he fired a gun into her home . According to the police affidavit, the woman reported that she found a window had been shattered on the porch to the rear of her home. A half hour later, as she was inspecting the damage, she saw a shirtless man come out of a home whose backyard faces hers and, raising a handgun, apparently fire in the direction of her house. A search by police found two bullet holes in the fence between the two residents. Middletown Police Detective Patrick Nicastro inspected the damage to the resident's porch and pulling back the siding, found a medium caliber bullet. Officers then visited Byrd, finding him shirtless, and detained him while the home was searched, though Byrd denied firing shots. According to the probable cause affidavit, the search turned up several rounds of handgun ammunition in the basement of Byrd's home. With a search warrant that was obtained, police eventually found a .357 revolver, 12-gauge double barrel shotgun and an M77 rifle. Byrd has a felony conviction stemming from a burglary committed when was 17, which would prevent him from legally possessing a firearm. In front of a judge, Byrd stated his case that he had fired his gun into the ground to clear the chamber because,in spite of the three firearms in his home, he was unfamiliar with guns and didn't know how to unload one. He is currently in custody at Bucks County prison facing charges of persons not to possess firearms and discharging a firearm into an occupied structure.","George Byrd IV, 31, has a felony conviction from a burglary committed when he was 17, barring him from owning firearms .

"Texas officials have withdrawn a plan to allow sales of alcohol at some gun shows, which would have come with strict conditions, such as a ban on sales of live ammunition. The Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission had received hundreds of negative responses to the idea and agreed Tuesday to back off the proposal. The change was meant to aid the Dallas Safari Club's annual convention, a massive event that draws up to 50,000 people. Alcohol sales would have come with a series of conditions, including that a firearm be disabled and not immediately turned over to the buyer. Texas officials have withdrawn a plan to allow sales of alcohol at some gun shows, which would have come with strict conditions, such as a ban on sales of live ammunition . But traditional gun show operators opposed the idea, saying they worried about mixing guns and alcohol. Opponents said any policy change should be left to the Legislature. Under current rules, if a gun show is held at a venue licensed to sell alcohol, drinks sales and consumption are suspended during the time it takes to set up, conduct and dismantle the gun show. 'We got a request from a gun club in the Dallas-Fort Worth area to amend the rules,' said agency spokeswoman Carolyn Beck. The Texas affiliate of the National Rifle Association said it had nothing to do with the request. The Texas State Rifle Association's Alice Tripp, said the idea was 'confusing' and questioned whether gun advocates would want to attend gun shows with such restrictions. 'Does that make any sense? Who would buy a gun at a gun show where you couldn't take possession of it?' she asked. 'Nobody is interested in selling alcohol at a gun show,' Tripp added. Change was meant to aid the Dallas Safari Club's annual convention, a massive event that draws up to 50,000 people. Alcohol sales would have come with a series of conditions such as not collecting the gun until later . Bill Clouse, one of several hundred people who attended the High Caliber Gun & Knife Show in Houston last month, described himself as a 'huge gun supporter' but said he doesn't believe guns and alcohol are a good combination. 'I don't think there will be a possibility for trouble. I just personally do not believe you should have alcohol and firearms in the same vicinity, whether you are hunting or at a gun show,' said Clouse, 34, a high school teacher. Josh Jensen, another person at Saturday's gun show, was also against the proposal, saying the idea is 'just silly to me.' 'You will find people in here who are going to say, 'Oh yeah, that's a great idea. Why can't we have a beer at the gun show? Nobody's got a loaded gun.' But stupid things happen. It's just like drinking and driving. Are you going to drink and drive?' said Jensen, 30, who works for a beer distributor.

"Shamed former Rotherham children's services boss Joyce Thacker received a £40,000 payoff after quitting her £130,000-a-year post last month. The details of the payoff, revealed after a Freedom of Information request, came as Mrs Thacker was singled out for criticism in a report published yesterday into the town's child sex abuse scandal. The Home Affairs Select Committee report said she ignored 'numerous credible warnings' about the scale of abuse, and called for an independent investigation. Payout: Rotherham Borough Council paid £40,000 to former strategic director of children's services Joyce Thacker, it has been revealed . The report said that there were still 'questions to be answered' despite the resignations of Mrs Thacker, police commissioner Shaun Wright, and council chief executive Martin Kimber. It said the new probe should focus on whether there was a 'deliberate cover-up'. Mrs Thacker faced repeated calls to resign in the wake of an investigation that revealed at least 1,400 children in the town had been sexually exploited between 1997 and 2013. The payoff left victims furious. One woman, now 29, who was abused between the ages of 14 and 16, said that Mrs Thacker should give the money to charity. She said: 'It absolutely disgusts me. It is shocking. She should donate the money.' Keith Vaz, the chairman of an influential Commons committee that has looked into the Rotherham scandal, said he was 'astounded' by the deal and called for the money to be repaid. Mr Vaz said: 'I am astounded that taxpayers' money has been used in what will be seen as a reward for the failures of Rotherham Council. 'The committee recommended Joyce Thacker, and others, resign for their inaction in light of the huge number of child sexual abuse cases. It was inappropriate of her to accept such a large sum when she left. 'I hope action will be taken to ensure that this money is repaid, and that large payoffs cannot be given under similar circumstances in the future.' Scandal: A Home Affairs Select Committee report said there were still 'questions to be answered' about the abuse that occurred in Rotherham, above . But Rotherham Borough Council said it had reached a mutual agreement with Mrs Thacker on the termination of her contract and said the sum was 'less than the contractual notice requirement'. News of the deal with Mrs Thacker came as Mr Vaz's committee called for an urgent investigation into whether public officials sought to cover up the extent of the scandal. The committee demanded 'a full, transparent and urgent' inquiry and called on the Home Office to do 'everything in its power' to locate any missing files in its possession relating to child sexual exploitation in Rotherham and other places. Elsewhere, the committee presented proposals for introducing a power of recall for police and crime commissioners (PCCs) after South Yorkshire PCC Shaun Wright initially refused to resign despite his clear links to the failures exposed at Rotherham Borough Council. Mr Vaz said: 'The proliferation of revelations about files which can no longer be located gives rise to public suspicion of a deliberate cover-up. 'The only way to address these concerns is with a full, transparent and urgent investigation. 'The Home Office must do everything in its power to locate any missing files in its possession relating to child sexual exploitation in Rotherham and other places.'","Details of payout revealed following a Freedom of Information request .

"Nick Clegg, at the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow today, wants to lift badly-paid workers out of tax and national insurance . Millions more middle-class taxpayers should be dragged into the 40p rate and hit with capital gains tax rises to help pay for tax breaks for the lower paid, Nick Clegg will say today. The Deputy Prime Minister will oppose Conservative plans to offer relief for the millions sucked into the higher rate of income tax. He will insist increases in the personal allowance and national insurance breaks must take priority over any increase in the threshold for the 40p rate, paid on income over £41,865. Mr Clegg says the Liberal Democrats would also raise capital gains tax, paid on the sale of assets such as second homes or shares, from 28 per cent to about 35 per cent for higher-rate taxpayers, raising £500 million a year. The income that can be made before capital gains tax kicks in would also be slashed dramatically, from £10,900 to about £2,500, raising about £250 million a year. That will drag thousands of people with small savings – such as someone who has worked hard to build up some shares for retirement – into the capital gains tax net. Mr Clegg’s move opens up a key election dividing line with the Conservatives, who have promised both a hike in the income tax threshold to £12,500 and an increase in the 40p threshold to £50,000 at their conference. He will say that his party wants to press on with cutting income tax straight away if it remains in government after the election. The first rise in the personal allowance, taking it to £11,000, should take place in April 2016, he says. This is worth about £100 a year to workers who earn over next year’s income tax threshold of £10,500 a year – roughly 29 million people. Aides said the 40p threshold would be reduced so that higher-rate taxpayers did not benefit more than those on the basic rate. ‘Everyone will benefit from the increase in the personal allowance, including higher-rate taxpayers, but it’s not right higher-rate taxpayers should do better than everyone else,’ said one. Mr Clegg has already announced plans to further increase the personal allowance to £12,500 a year by 2020 – a policy matched by the Conservative Party at its conference last week. The latest YouGov survey shows how just eight per cent of people now say they will vote Lib Dem - down from almost a third at the last election . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg (centre) will address the party conference in Glasgow tomorrow . But after this point, he said the party would make taking more low earners out of paying national insurance a priority – not relief for those on the 40p rate, who now include better-paid nurses, teachers and police officers. Mr Clegg insisted that tax rises should ‘start at the top and work down, not start at the bottom and work up’. A Labour spokesman said: ‘You can’t trust a word Nick Clegg and the Lib Dems say. They say they want fairer taxes for working people but in government they have given millionaires a tax break while everyone else pays more.’ The Lib Dems have rejected proposals for any new runways in Britain, in a major blow to Nick Clegg. Activists voted against a change in party policy to support airport expansion in the South East despite Mr Clegg urging supporters to allow a new runway at Gatwick. But the policy also specified 'no net increase in runways across the UK as a whole'. Speaking after the vote, Cambridge MP Julian Huppert said the party 'has made a clear decision', adding the issue would be 'an important part of coalition discussions' with other parties if there was another hung Parliament. Schools minister David Laws said the party would 'respect' the outcome of the vote. He told BBC Radio 4's World At One programme: 'We don't just ignore decisions of our party conference. 'We've debated this twice at party conference, of course we''ll consider on the federal policy committee and on the manifesto committee the precise way in which our commitments on this will be framed. 'But the idea that we're going to ignore this vote is not the way we do things, and the basic approach that we agreed today will go into the manifesto. We're a party that respects the views of our members.'","Workers on less than £12,500 to pay no tax or national insurance .

"A group of young Israeli expats in Berlin have unleashed controversy back home by encouraging others to join them for a cheaper life. The high cost of living in Israel has driven many to up sticks to the German capital, with the fact that a popular chocolate pudding can be bought for a third of the price there used to highlight the issue. However, the exodus has sparked fury in Israel, with one commentator labelling the trend 'disgusting'. Scroll down for video . A group of young Israeli expats in Berlin (pictured) have unleashed controversy back home by encouraging others to join them for a cheaper life . The high cost of living in Israel has driven many to up sticks to the German capital (pictured), with the fact that a popular chocolate pudding can be bought for a third of the price there used to highlight the issue . The idealization of Berlin is viewed by many as a hurtful provocation, with memories of the Holocaust, in which six million Jews were murdered, still fresh, especially among Israel's large community of survivors. Some still refuse to visit Germany or buy products it makes. Even if the economic argument is justified, Israelis largely feel that giving up should remain out of bounds. 'What does any of that have to do with Berlin? What does any of that have to do with the disgusting trend of encouraging Israelis to emigrate?' columnist Ben Caspit wrote in Maariv. 'The war over our home needs to be fought at home.' The uproar began several weeks ago when a 25-year-old former Israeli army officer flaunted photos of his grocery receipts - including those of a popular chocolate pudding that sells in Germany for one-third the price in Israel - and boasted about the good life in the German capital. The idealization of Berlin is viewed by many in Israel as a hurtful provocation . Now known as the 'Milky' protest, after the pudding's Israeli name, the Facebook campaign has received 17,000 'likes' and pictures of Israelis holding signs asking German Chancellor Angela Merkel to give them a visa have gone viral. Israeli TV channels have sent reporters to Berlin to cover the thriving Israeli expat community there. Finance Minister Yair Lapid, whose centrist Yesh Atid party rode the 2011 protests to become a major player in Israeli politics, said he sympathized with the burden of the new protesters but not their method. 'These people are anti-Zionists. I'm a Zionist, I think Jews should live in Israel,' he said. 'That doesn't change the fact that the cost of living is high here ... The cost of living is not the only question for a person to consider when deciding where to live and by which values.' The former army officer behind the protest said he still loves his country, defends it when it is slandered in Europe and would prefer to live in Tel Aviv but just can't afford it. He said his goal is to spur politicians like Lapid into action. 'My aim is to educate the Israeli government. They need to make Israel a more attractive place for young people,' said the slim man with short-cropped black hair and dark brown eyes, in an interview the Associated Press in Berlin this week. He asked that his identity be withheld because he wants 'the public to focus on the message, not on the messenger.' One commentator said that 'the war over our home needs to be fought at home'. Pictured is the Tel Aviv city skyline and beachfront . He said thousands of exasperated Israelis have asked him for help in getting visas. He reasons that if Israelis vote with their feet and simply leave the country, the government will be forced to serve the public better. Cabinet Minister Yair Shamir, son of former Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and a member of the ultranationalist Yisrael Beitenu party, told the Maariv newspaper that he pities 'the Israelis who no longer remember the Holocaust and abandoned Israel for a pudding.' In the daily Haaretz, columnist Ravit Hecht argued that such ultranationalists were actually driving the young away, but that was still no excuse to bolt. 'Berlin is a lovely city, but it is sucking away all the forces that we desperately need here, especially now,' she wrote. Like many other expatriates drawn to Berlin's cheap housing and vibrant lifestyle, thousands of Israelis already call the city home, according to the Associated Press. Since many enter Germany with other European passports or come for limited periods of time, it's hard to track exact numbers: Estimates range from 3,000 to 30,000. Many come to enjoy free university study and work as artists and musicians. Others have opened small businesses and organized Hebrew language classes and activities for children. Those with German passports are also eligible for a welfare stipend of almost 400 euros a month. Eran Levy, a 46-year-old who moved to Berlin nine years ago, said he enjoys the calmer pace of life and the relief that his daughter is growing up far away from bomb shelters and rocket attacks. 'I like how people in Berlin are so non-judgmental and take me as I am,' said Levy, who works in customer service and is now fluent in German. In practice, demographers say the phenomenon is more symbolic than actual. The number of European Jews who move to Israel is much higher than the number of Israelis heading to Europe. Take France alone, which has Western Europe's largest population of Jews, at about 500,000: Emigration this year to Israel is set to top the annual record of nearly 5,300 set after the Six-Day War in 1967, according to the Jewish Agency for Israel - in part due to concerns about militant Islam and France's sluggish economy. Sergio Della Pergola, a leading demographer from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said Israeli emigration has actually dropped considerably in recent years and those who did leave were headed primarily to the United States and Canada, not Europe. He said the latest central Bureau of Statistics figures showed that 2012 had the lowest emigration rate in decades. That same year, only 3,065 Israelis were documented as living in Berlin. 'There is a big gap between the mood and the facts,' he said. Even so, the idea of people leaving when the going gets tough is hard to swallow in a country where struggle and sacrifice are so engrained in the national psyche. Former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin once derided Israelis who left the country as 'a cascade of wimps.' Commentators have suggested he would be turning over in his grave if he knew about the Olim Le'Berlin group behind the come-to-Berlin campaign, whose name uses the Hebrew word typically reserved for Jews immigrating to Israel - 'aliyah' - in describing its actions.","The high cost of living in Israel has driven many to move to Berlin .

"Distraught parents have made a emotional plea for their five year old boy to come home after he was swept out to sea by a freak wake. A major search to find missing, Jack Dixon, is underway after the little boy disappeared into the water on Shelly beach at Mount Maunganui in New Zealand around noon on Wednesday. The young boy was playing with family when a large wave dragged him into the surf along with two of his cousins. The two sisters scrambled on to rocks and were dragged ashore by two relatives but Jack, who could not swim, disappeared into the water. Jack Dixon, 5, went missing  at Shelly beach at Mount Maunganui in New Zealand on Wednesday . Inspector Karl Wright-St Clair from New Zealand police said they would continue to search for the boy until dark fell. '50 search crews and rescue volunteers, plus a number of surf life saving volunteers are wading through rock pools,' he said. 'It's(the search) been going on for 30 hours, crews are tired but highly motivated to bring him home.' 'We are basically searching to bring Jack home to his family as apposed to a rescue operation.' 'Its mostly been professional volunteers and land search and rescue and surf life saving, these people are all volunteers.' The inspector said, on Wednesday when the boy went missing, there was a three to four easterly swell running straight into Shelly beach. He described the beach as normally very safe, used by many families and young children all year round. 'He was caught by a freak wave,' said inspector Wright-St Clair. Jack's parents Wayne Dixon and Karen Spargo released a statement through the police thanking all those who have helped. 'We are shocked, upset, and lost at what has happened.' 'We want to thank Police, lifeguards, and everyone who has done so much for us. We know there is so much community support, and we're truly touched.' The young boy was playing with his cousins when a large wave dragged him into the surf . 'Jack will be missed by everyone who knew him. We just want him to come home.' Inspector Wright-St Clair said the family have been struggling to come to terms with what's happened. 'They're extremely distraught, they are slowing coming to realisation that the situation is grave and now just want him home,' he said. 'We're keeping them informed all step of the way, they haven't left here since being informed, so we're keeping them up to date.' An overnight search is set to be abandoned and will resume first thing in the morning when there is another low tide. 'There's very little value in searching at night under conditions like this,' he said. 'It's tough on searchers they are just highly motivated and just want to bring him back.' Initially search helicopter patrolled the beach as well as the coastguard. The police native dive team joined in Thursday morning in a shoreline search but visibility restricted them to complete their mission. 'There's hope over the next few days, there will be a window of opportunity for the dive team to return and complete.' Jack, left with his mother and right, was swept away along with two cousins but they were able to scramble on to rocks and were saved by family members . Police say they will re-assess the situation every day as the search goes on. Besides the countless volunteers helping with the search for the five year old, there's been a huge outpouring of support from the community. 'It has been humbling to see, food and cards and messages of support for SLS and also huge amount of media and support.' The inspector says the the family are local but not members of the surf life saving club and came to the beach on school holidays. 'It's a popular holiday destination, hundreds of people on the beach , particualrly beautiful part of the country,' he said. A Givealittle page has been setup for Jack and hopes to raise funds to assist the family with the costs associated with the search and for the many tough days ahead of them. So far more than $2,800 NZ has been raised with the goal of getting to $5000.","The search continues for Jack Dixon, 5, who disappeared after being swept into the sea at New Zealand's Shelly beach .

"Ryanair's popular - and controversial - cabin crew bikini calendar has been scrapped, the airline's chief executive has confirmed. The calendars, which feature 12 members of the low-cost airline's female cabin crew posing provocatively in bikinis, have been published annually since 2008. As well as raising hundreds of thousands of pounds for charity, the calendars have raised plenty of eyebrows, with advertisements for the product banned in 2011. Scroll down for video . Calendar girls: Ryanair has announced the airline will not publish its cabin crew bikini calendar next year . Steamy: The calendars have raised hundreds of thousands of pounds for charity - and plenty of controversy too . Following his announcement of the cancelled calendars on Irish radio station Today FM, Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary hinted that the move had been a reluctant decision but was not in keeping with its family-friendly image. 'I think it was a great idea by the cabin crew,' he told AOL. 'It genuinely did raise huge amounts of money for charity and we will struggle to replace it with something as good or as successful.' A spokesperson for the airline said that next year's charity efforts are still being worked out. 'We are finalising our charity options for 2015 which will be unveiled soon,' he said. Charitable efforts: The calendars have been published annually since 2008 - these shots from the 2013 edition were shot in Paphos, Cyprus . Objectifying staff? Despite backlash against the calendars, the airline has always defended them on the basis that the idea came from cabin crew themselves . The inaugural calendar in 2008 featured cabin crew posing on aircraft and on the tarmac. One crew member wore a life jacket and sucked suggestively on the inflation tube, while another appeared scantily clad in the cockpit. In more recent years the photoshoots have taken place in Crete and Cyprus. Ryanair landed in hot water with the Advertising Standards Authority in 2011, when racy shots from the photoshoot used to advertise that year's calendar were deemed 'sexist' and 'demeaning'. Thousands of people signed an online petition against the ads, which was started by a flight attendant. The ads were eventually banned by the ASA. Executive decision: Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary, who confirmed the news on Irish radio, has hinted that the move had been a reluctant decision . Last one: The 2014 was as steamy as ever, and featured the cabin crew posing in lingerie on the beach in Chania, Crete . Despite the backlash, the airline continued to publish the calendar, and just last year appeared to be committed to continuing the tradition. 'There is nothing demeaning about our people volunteering to raise lots of money for very worthwhile charities such as the UK Teenage Cancer Trust,' spokesperson Robin Kiely told MailOnline Travel at the time. 'Our charity calendars raise over €100,000 for charity each year so we intend and continue to support our cabin crew, who like it, and want us to continue it.' International: The calendars feature crew from all of the airline's bases, including Dusseldorf and Rome . Taking off: The inaugural calendar in 2008 saw 12 crew members in provocative poses . Outrage: In 2011 advertisements for the calendars were deemed 'sexist' and 'demeaning' What next? The airline says that it has yet to decide upon its charitable efforts for 2015 - though CEO Michael O'Leary has voiced his doubts that they will be able to replicate the calendar's success . It also pointed to a passenger survey which suggested that 99 per cent support the calendar, with fewer than 300 against it. Moreover, it found that just 10.5 per cent of respondees believed the calendar should include men, while only six per cent said they wanted a men-only calendar. Meanwhile, Ryanair announced today that it carried 8.5 million passengers last month - a five per cent increase on the figure for September 2013. A total of 83.8 million passengers travelled with the Irish carrier in the 12 months ending in September - a 4 per cent rise on the total for the 12 months ending in September last year. MailOnline Travel has contacted Ryanair for comment.","Calendars has sparked debate since inaugural one was published in 2008 .

"Two young women have claimed a ghost photobombed a selfie they took during a night out. Friends Kayley Atkinson and Victoria Greeves took the photograph while they enjoyed an evening in Newcastle-upon-Tyne on Sunday.

Location: The two friends were at the Slug and Lettuce pub (above) on the Quayside in Newcastle-upon-Tyne . But after striking their best pose for a selfie together, the women noticed there was a third person in the photo - which appears to be an elderly lady dressed in Victorian clothing. Horrified by the figure which seemed to be peering between the best friends, Miss Greeves - who works as a nurse - deleted the spine tingling photo from her phone. Friends: Miss Greeves, 22, and Miss Atkinson, 23, have known each other for the past six years . She said: ‘We took the picture in the bar as we usually would, we are both fans of a selfie. 'I uploaded the picture to Snapchat and thought nothing more of it. But later that night Kayley rang me in a panic and told me to have a closer look. She said there was a figure in the background, and I am quite sceptical about things like that so I just laughed at the time. ‘But when I looked back at the picture I could not believe what I was seeing. It is terrifying. I couldn't look at the picture at the beginning as I was too freaked out. It is so clear, and it looks like what can only be described as a Victorian woman, laughing behind us.’ The women, who have known each other for the past six years, are regulars at the bar - but said they would think twice before going back again. Local authority worker Miss Atkinson said: ‘The bar was dead when we went in. It was only when I got home later on that I noticed the photo. 'I couldn't believe it. I was absolutely terrified and Victoria was so scared that she deleted the photo off her phone. A lot of people have said we must have photoshopped the picture. 'I can't blame them, but neither of us would even know how to do that. I didn't believe in ghosts at all before, but I'm not so sure any more.’ A member of staff at the bar said no-one who worked there had ever seen a ghost.","Kayley Atkinson and Victoria Greeves were on a night out in Newcastle .

"Managing to capture the elusive Northern Lights is a feat in itself. But three natural wonders all in the one photograph? That certainly makes for spectacular picture. Scottish photographer Maciej Winiarczyk got the Northern Lights, the Milky Way and an erupting volcano all in one shot during a recent trip to Iceland.

Chasing the sky: Maciej shot his first aurora picture in January 2012 from Wick in Scotland, and has been chasing them ever since . Explosive: The current Bardarbunga volcano  eruption is Iceland's largest in over 200 years . He said: 'Most of my aurora shots are taken from Caithness on the far north of Scotland, where I live but I did two photo expeditions to chase northern lights in Iceland and other countries. 'I picked Iceland because it's easy to get there from Scotland and in case of bad weather or poor aurora activity you always have an option to shoot . remarkable and raw Icelandic landscape instead. 'I knew the volcano was erupting. I thought I might be able to photograph the Milky Way as well as the volcano but I never imagined for the cloud to break . and release the glorious dancing lights.' Mesmerising: Spotting aurora corona, a converging spectrum of colours, is a rare event . Maciej added: 'Every aurora display is unique. The most exciting thing is seeing aurora corona, a converging spectrum of colours, but that doesn't happen too often, especially in Scotland which is too far south. Maciej took the most recent shots on a trip to Iceland which he has just returned from. His images have won astro-photography competitions around the . world. He said: 'I've never considered myself as the world's best in capturing the lights, but some people have suggested that I am one of the leading . photographers in that field.

Award-winning: Maciej's images have won astro-photography competitions around the world . Talent: He was born and educated in Poland and has lived in Scotland for more than ten years . Options: Maciej favours Iceland as if there is bad weather or poor aurora activity, there is always Icelandic landscape to shoot . 'I am never completely happy with my work and always see space for some improvement.' On his recent trip the photographer shot a time lapse of the aurora showcasing its lights sweep across a bay. He said: 'Shooting the lights isn't simple. It depends on the aurora activity and its brightness.'

"A blind woman is taking court action against supermarket giant Coles for discrimination because it takes her days to complete a shopping order on their online store. Gisele Mesnage, who is legally blind, wants Coles to make its website more user friendly for people who have a visual impairment. The supermarket giant said it had made 'significant investments' to ensure everyone's shopping experience on its site, including those who are blind. Scroll down for video . Blind woman Gisele Mesnage, from Sydney, has taken legal action against Coles for discrimination . But Ms Mesnage, from Sydney, said legal action had been a last resort for her as she had repeatedly asked Coles to fix the problem. To use her computer, she uses a special screen-reader to access the internet and has had issues with using the supermarket's online store to do her shopping since 2008. The screen-reader offers Ms Mesnage quick navigation, audio feedback and quick responsiveness. But Coles' website failed to have the capability to allow her to shop efficiently. Ms Mesnage (pictured with Former Disability Discrimination Commission Graeme Innes and lawyer Michelle Cohen) uses a special screen-reader to access the internet . When she hovers over items on the site she is not told any information but receives generic error messages. 'When selecting a delivery time, I'm just hearing ""blank"",' Ms Mesnage told reporters on Thursday. 'When I tap my keyboard I have to wait 30 seconds, 40 seconds before the website responds.' In an online statement, Ms Mesnage added she just wanted to be treated like every other shopper. 'I'm sick of being shut out or spending literally days completing just one order,' she said. 'Although Coles has tried to fix problems with the site over the years, the site is not consistently accessible. 'Each time the site is upgraded, accessibility issues recur, or new ones arise.' The firm who are representing Ms Mesnage in this case is the Public Interest Advocacy and her lawyer is senior solicitor Michelle Cohen. 'Online grocery shopping should allow people who are blind to do their supermarket shopping independently,' Ms Cohen said. 'It is very disappointing that a large supermarket chain like Coles has not made accessibility a high priority. 'It's not acceptable for people in a wheelchair to be prevented from using a physical supermarket, so why should people with vision impairment be treated as second-class citizens?' A Coles spokesman said the supermarket sought to provide 'outstanding service' to all its customers . Ms Mesnage has filed two complaints with the Human Rights Commission since the issues arose in 2008 . A Coles spokesman said the supermarket sought to provide 'outstanding service' to all its customers. 'Coles has made a significant investment to provide a great online shopping experience for all of our customers, including many who are vision impaired or have other disabilities,' he said. 'Coles recognises and endorses the importance of online accessibility, and we are continually working to improve our online grocery shop, including improvements to the accessibility of the website. 'We work with experts in this field to make our site usable by people with disabilities.

"Actress Maureen Lipman has abandoned five decades of support for the Labour Party and announced that she would vote for 'almost any other' party at the General Election, partly in protest at Ed Miliband's support for recognising the Palestinian state. The star of stage and screen gave a dim assessment of the present shadow cabinet, telling the magazine Standpoint: 'The Chuka Harman Burnham Hunt Balls brigade? I can't, in all seriousness, go into a booth and put my mark on any one of them.' 'For the first time in five decades, I shall not be voting Labour.' Maureen Lipman with Tom Conti, the actor, and Lord Mandelson, who served under two Labour premiers . Maureen Lipman with her late husband, Jack Rosenthal, who canvassed for Sydney Silverman in the 1945 General Election . Lipman, who is Jewish, reserved her most hostile comments for the Labour leader's decision to back a symbolic Commons vote in favour of recognising the state of Palestine alongside Israel. She wrote: 'My late husband, Jack Rosenthal, canvassed for Sydney Silverman in the 1945 General Election. ""In them days,"" said the father in his seminal television play Bar Mitzvah Boy, ""they handed you your Labour Party membership just after your circumcision."" They gave with one hand and took away with the other.' She said that she had a 'sneaking suspicion' that David Miliband – who was unexpectedly beaten to the leadership by his brother in 2010 – may return strengthened by his time out in the real world'. 'I'm an actress, Ed, and I am often commended for my timing,' she wrote of the Commons vote. 'Frankly, my dear, yours sucks. 'The world is exploding around us. Isis is beheading our civilians while raping and pillaging across Syria and Iraq. Presidents [Vladimir] Putin and [Bashar] Assad are playing such heavy-handed games that we don't know which rebel group to support. 'Hong Kong may be about to see a replay of Tiananmen. Islamist terrorism in every spot on the globe and if one Jew had been responsible for any of those bombings, there would, I am afraid to say, have been another Kristallnacht. 'At this point in our history you choose to back these footling backbenchers in this ludicrous piece of propaganda?' Lipman sharing shoes with former Labour leader Lord Kinnock (left) and as Margaret Thatcher stabbing Ken Livingstone in the back (right) She went on: 'May I remind you that no one is tunnelling into Dover or sending rockets into Coventry, yet we seem to have every right to bomb the living daylights out of Iraq. 'Again. Conclusion: one law for the Israelis, another law for the rest of the world. Plus ça change.' Lipman also took a swipe at Mr Miliband's awkward eating of a bacon sandwich in front of the TV cameras during the local and European election campaign in May. Mr Miliband, who is from a secular Jewish family, had told her he wanted to 'learn more about his religion of his birth' by attending a traditional Shabbat dinner at her home. 'Two days later he was all over the papers, knocking back a bacon sandwich,'she said. 'Now there is nothing intrinsically wrong with a secular Jew chomping on a thinly sliced, pan-fried pig rump — my late husband, before we were married, had been known to queue up for such a thing from the catering van on an early morning film shoot. That was fine with me. His choice. I just couldn't kiss him. 'So, come election day, I shall give my vote to another party. Almost any other party. Until my party is once more led by mensches,' she concluded - using the Yiddish term for 'a person of integrity and honour'. It seems unlikely the actress would lend her support to Ukip - after the eurosceptic party leader Nigel Farage sought to blame one of her best-known roles for too many young people going to university to study poor quality degrees. The star's well-known 1980s BT television advert, where she told her grandson that having an 'ology' made him a scientist, meant now there were lots of students 'getting 'ologies', Mr Farage said. 'I blame Maureen Lipman for the whole thing.'","Actress cannot in all seriousness vote for 'the Chuka Harman Burnham Hunt Balls brigade'

"Darren Bent made the most of his Aston Villa return - scoring twice in their pre season opener - with Gary Gardner also on target as Paul Lambert's side ran out 3-1 winners against Mansfield.

"Prime Minister David Cameron is to unveil the extension of the party’s flagship Help to Buy scheme, which aims to get people on the housing ladder . First-time buyers under the age of 40 are to be offered 20 per cent discounts on 100,000 new homes. David Cameron is to unveil a dramatic extension of the party’s flagship Help to Buy scheme, which aims to get people on the housing ladder. Under the scheme, 100,000 houses would be built on so-called ‘brownfield’ land and reserved for sale only to young people buying their first homes. The ‘starter homes’ will be available throughout England and offered at prices 20 per cent less than their market value. So a house worth £200,000 could be bought by a first-time buyer for £160,000 – a reduction of £40,000. The discount will be possible because a Conservative government would exempt housebuilders from some taxes and allow the release of cheap brownfield sites – land formerly used for industrial or commercial purposes – to build these homes on. Builders would be obliged to pass their savings on to buyers. The scheme, to be announced at the Conservatives’ final party conference before next year’s General Election, is the latest attempt to echo the focus on property ownership of Margaret Thatcher’s government. Mr Cameron will say: ‘We want to help more young people achieve the dream of home ownership so today I can pledge we will build 100,000 homes for young, first-time buyers. ‘We will make these starter homes 20 per cent cheaper by exempting them from a raft of taxes and by using brownfield land. I don’t want to see young people locked out of home ownership. 'We’ve already started to tackle the problem with Help to Buy mortgages – and these new plans will help tens of thousands more people to buy their first home.’ As well as helping struggling young people wanting to buy a home, Tory strategists believe the policy will appeal to parents and grandparents worried about their families’ prospects. Developers will have to demonstrate before planning approval is given that the houses they are planning to build will be at least a fifth cheaper than comparable houses in order to qualify for the cheaper plots and tax exemptions. The developments will avoid most of the taxes and regulations that are normally imposed on other new homes, like the community infrastructure levy, imposed by local authorities, and the ‘Section 106’ requirement that a certain number of homes must be affordable. The extension of the Help to Buy scheme will see ‘starter homes’ available throughout England and offered to first-time buyers who are under the age of 40 at prices 20 per cent less than the property's market value . The discount will be possible because a Conservative government would exempt housebuilders from some taxes and allow the release of cheap brownfield sites - land formerly used for industrial purpose - to build on . Starter homes will also be exempt from the zero carbon homes standard, an environmental levy. They will be built on brownfield land already zoned for development that is no longer needed for industrial or commercial uses, including surplus land owned by public sector organisations. It costs less than other land, but is not normally made available to build houses on. First-time buyers will be able to combine the 20 per cent discount on the price of the new home with a Help to Buy mortgage, meaning that both the house and the mortgage will be made more affordable. Young workers will get guaranteed cheap rent to allow them to save a deposit for their first home under another new Tory scheme. The ‘rent to buy’ programme will offer first-time buyers a 20 per cent discount off their rent for seven years. They will then be given the right to buy the home. The £400million plan from Communities Secretary Eric Pickles aims to give young workers a ‘springboard’ on to the property ladder. The scheme is designed for single people earning £33,000 or less and couples on up to £66,000. Housing associations will run the scheme, but ministers will insist the new one- and two-bed flats are given to ‘hard-working’ people who have never owned a home. The Help to Buy equity loan scheme was introduced last year to offer buyers a 20 per cent Government loan to buy new properties, worth up to 95 per cent loan to value. It was due to expire in 2016 but has been extended until 2020. Housebuilding under Labour fell to levels not seen since the 1920s. The number of first-time buyers also collapsed, falling 60 per cent from 501,500 in 1997 to just 185,000 in 2009. Although the total number of new houses being built in the 12 months to June of this year rose to 137,780 – a 22 per cent increase on the previous year – the Government says more must be done. Stewart Baseley, executive chairman of the Home Builders Federation, said: ‘Increasing housing supply is a huge and complex challenge and significant constraints remain. ‘Enabling more first-time buyers to realise their ambition of home ownership and introducing policies that allow more land to come forward and increase house building would clearly be positive. ‘The industry is keen to work with government to develop any policies that would allow the country to build more high quality homes in the right places.'","David Cameron will unveil dramatic extension to party's Help to Buy scheme .

"Nissan announced on Saturday that it is recalling more than 52,000 vehicles for passenger air bags that can explode with too much force and send shards of metal into the passenger compartment. The vehicles have air bag systems made by troubled Japanese supplier Takata Corp. The Nissan recalls are among nearly 8 million others made by 10 automakers, mainly in Southern high-humidity states, over the Takata air bags. The recall affects the Infiniti FX35 and FX45 from 2003 to 2005, Infiniti I35 from 2003 and 2004 and Infiniti M35 and M45 from 2006. Also affected are Nissan Pathfinders from 2003 and 2004 and Nissan Sentras from 2004 to 2006. Recall: Nissan announced on Saturday that it is recalling more than 52,000 vehicles for passenger air bags that can explode with too much force and send shards of metal into the passenger compartment . In total, 52,738 vehicles are involved. The newly recalled vehicles were sold or registered in 12 high-humidity states and territories. The humidity can cause the air bag propellant to burn too fast and potentially blow apart the metal canisters. The problem has been linked to four deaths. Affected states and territories include Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas and the territories of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Saipan, Guam and American Samoa. Takata controls about 22 percent of the global air bag market. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating whether Takata and automakers that use its air bags acted quickly enough once the defects were suspected. Nissan announced a small recall of two Infiniti models late last month also tied to Takata-made air bags. That recall affected some 1,800 Infiniti QX56 SUVs from 2013 and the Infiniti QX80 from 2014. The Tokyo-based Nissan Motor Co. says it will notify owners and replace the air bag inflator for free.

"Few things have had more influence on science-fiction than Star Trek, and (most) fans breathed a sigh of relief when J.J. Abrams's 2009 reboot of Gene Roddenberry's classic series stayed respectful to the source material. Thankfully, from the look of these latest screens, the video game will do so, too. Although most details are being kept under wraps, gameplay sees Kirk and Spock working together to stop the legendary Gorn from conquering the galaxy. Out of this world: The Enterprise has been recreated wonderfully and you will be able to wander around inside . Interestingly, although combat revolves around a cover-system similar to that found in the Gears of War games, there's a strong focus on teamwork. Spock and Kirk will both have their own special abilities that reflect their unique characteristics. Kirk can call for an aerial assault from the Enterprise, while Spock can mind melt, perform the Vulcan death grip and use the tricorder to find enemy weak points. Although there has been some concern from fans that the game would be straight-forward shooter, Brian Miller, vice president of Paramount told Eurogamer last year: 'You will have elements of a shooter. You'll have elements of exploration, and adventure and discovery. This is what the new Star Trek is about.' The game is powered by Digital Extremes' Evolution Engine, most notably used in Dark Sector and The Darkness II. Early gameplay footage revealed last year already looked graphically stronger than both of those titles. Particularly impressive were the well-rendered environments which conveyed the impressive sense of scale fundamentally required in such a title. Watch this space: Gameplay and level design lends itself to cooperative gameplay. Often you'll have to work together to solve environmental puzzles . It promises a 'sweeping journey' across unexplored planets and enemy battleships, and players will have full access to all of the latest 23rd century gear. Speaking to MailOnline, Lee Kirton Marketing and PR Director at Namco Bandi, said: 'It’s great to see that the release of STAR TREK: The Video Game has caused so much interest. Paramount Pictures have spent the last three years making the game and we’re truly proud of the results. 'By giving players the chance to step into the shoes of either Kirk or Spock, two of the most well-known and loved characters in all of science fiction and adventure, we’re giving both gamers and Star Trek fans alike the chance to really explore the universe of this iconic franchise.'

Clifford had been warned by his lawyers not to speak to reporters gathered outside his mansion when he returned home today. However, after entering the house he came back outside and broke his silence, speaking briefly from inside his silver Audi A3. 'Everybody knows the position and obviously I was incredibly disappointed with what's happened,' he told Channel 4 news this evening.

When asked what he thought would happen at the sentencing hearing he simply responded 'cheers', and drove away. Clifford . was known as a confidante of the stars and counted on by many . celebrities to manage their careers during times of crisis. He . represented TV mogul Simon Cowell and advised countless others on public . relations strategy and damage control. Dropped: Earlier today it was reported that Mr Cowell had ditched Clifford as his PR advisor following the guilty verdicts . Earlier . today it was reported that Mr Cowell had ditched Clifford as his PR . advisor, following the guilty verdicts after the pair had worked . together for a decade. A . source told the Sun that Cowell was 'horrified' by what the court heard . during Clifford's three-week trial and is now 'distancing' himself from . his former PR man. Despite . the split, Clifford's company, Max Clifford Associates, was still using . a picture of Cowell on its website this morning before the whole site . was taken down around midday. During . the trial, Southwark Crown Court heard that Clifford had lured young . girls into sex by offering them acting roles, including in the hit TV . soap opera 'Dynasty.' One of the schoolgirls he molested told the Daily Mail: ‘It took . me and other victims many years to pluck up the courage to seek justice. 'We . were young innocent victims of a powerful, manipulative and dishonest . man whom, over the years, we saw become crowned king of the . kiss-and-tell industry.’ Sources . close to Clifford, who spent £250,000 on his defence, said he had been . urged by close associates several months ago to plead guilty. But he had . insisted on fighting the charges, convinced he might go free. Clifford, who in 2010 accepted a settlement reported to be over £1million from the News of the World after his phone was hacked, could now be pursued for compensation by his victims. Clifford . is the first celebrity to be convicted under Operation Yewtree, the . £2.7million Scotland Yard investigation sparked by the death of Jimmy . Savile. The . guilty verdicts will be seen as at least partial vindication of the . Crown Prosecution Service in its controversial pursuit of 1970s . celebrities, following a string of recent acquittals. Clifford . was branded a grade-A paedophile and ‘every little girl’s worst . nightmare’ during his eight-week trial at London’s Southwark Crown . Court.

Above, Clifford is pictured with his daughter Louise outside court after his conviction . His . disabled 42-year-old daughter Louise also showed no emotion in the . public gallery – she had given evidence in his defence, but prosecutors . said she was tainted by her blind loyalty to her father. Freed . on bail, outside court Clifford was asked repeatedly if he would say . ‘sorry’ to his victims. He smiled awkwardly but said, . uncharacteristically, that his lawyers had told him ‘to say nothing at . all’. Clifford . had denied all the allegations and called his victims ‘mentally . disturbed’ fantasists hunting compensation. Their accusations were ‘a . fairy story that only you believe,’ he had snapped to the prosecutor. Younger days: During the trial, Clifford admitted attending sex parties in his youth . But . after nine days of deliberations, the jury of six men and four women . believed the women, finding Clifford guilty of eight counts of indecent . assault: Four against a 15-year-old in 1977, one on a 19-year-old in . 1981 or 1982, two against a 17-year-old in 1982 or 1983, and one on an . 18-year-old in the early 1980s. He . was cleared of another two allegations – one 18-year-old who said she . was pushed up against a wall in his central London offices when he . groped her and kissed her in 1975, and another, aged 19, who claimed she . was groped in a taxi in 1979. The . jury could not reach a verdict on a count involving a woman who claimed . he groped her in his car after meeting her at a Wimpy bar in South . London in 1966. In . fact, there were 23 alleged victims who came forward to police, but prosecutors . decided to proceed with what they perceived to be the seven strongest . cases.

He was bailed on the condition he spends nights at his £3.5million Surrey mansion. The judge told him: ‘You must realise that the fact I have given you bail is no indication of what the final sentence will be.’ Last . night Jenny Hopkins, Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor for London, said the . verdicts ‘provide a long-denied justice to the victims of serious . sexual offences’.","Clifford faces jail after he was convicted of eight counts of indecent assault .

"Escaped jail: Angela Roberts, 45, of Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, was given a community order after admitting assaulting Valerie Barrett with her shoe . A mother-of-two who left a woman with a 1.5inch gash on her head after hitting her with a stiletto in a drunken rage has escaped with just a community order. Angela Roberts, 45, had drunk five pints of lager when she heard that her father had been assaulted at a nearby Wetherspoons pub in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent. Assuming the attacker to be Valerie Barrett, whom she had rowed with in a different pub earlier, Roberts went to the Reginald Mitchell pub in Stoke-on-Trent in search of her. A court heard that as she walked in, she heard a bouncer describe the attacker over his radio, and spotted Miss Barrett, who matched the description. Roberts, from Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, struck Miss Barrett in the head with the stiletto, gashing her head and leaving her covered in blood. Police were called to the Reginald Mitchell pub and Roberts, who had never been in trouble with the police before, was arrested at the scene. Yesterday she pleaded guilty to one charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court. Prosecuting Fiona Cortese told the court that Miss Barrett had gone to the pub with her daughter when she was attacked. She said: 'Miss Barrett and her daughter went to the Reginald Mitchell pub and at some point there was an altercation with an elderly male. 'She later described feeling a blow to her head. The next thing she remembered was being in an ambulance. 'A door supervisor saw the defendant inside carrying a stiletto in her hand. 'She was walking quickly towards Miss Barrett and he saw her swing the stiletto, which connected with her head.' Ms Cortese added that Roberts was drunk when police arrived, having drank five pints of lager throughout the day. The defendant told officers she had gone out with her father and had seen Miss Barrett and her daughter earlier on in another pub. Scene: The attack took place at the Reginald Mitchell pub in the Hanley district of Stoke-on-Trent . Roberts struck Miss Barrett with a stiletto shoe, making a 1.5inch gash on her head, Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard (file image) The court heard they had a heated discussion and altercation before the stiletto attack, which happened later that evening. Jason Holt, defending Roberts, said she had no previous convictions and was having counselling as a result of the incident. He said: 'A description was given by the door staff and it was quite obvious the people they were talking about. 'That is why she went in the pub, believing she was going to defend her father. 'She took off her shoes, not to use as a weapon. When she approached this woman, they were in her hands.' Roberts was handed a 12-month community order and told to pay £750 compensation. Sentencing, . Judge David Fletcher said: 'I accept it was a single blow, and the . stiletto was not taken off to be used as a weapon. 'The main aggravating feature was the amount of alcohol that you consumed. 'I have absolutely no doubt this would not have happened if you had not been drinking the amount you had.'","Mother-of-two Angela Roberts, 45, had a row with Valerie Barrett earlier in the evening .

"Cupid, a young bay mare, was bought by City broker Ranald Laurie in 1911 as a present for his son, Vernon, on his 15th birthday. For the next three years, the teenager spent his days hunting with his beloved horse in the countryside near the family farm in Essex. But in 1914 war was declared and Ranald, who had recently resigned his position as lieutenant colonel in the Territorial Army, enlisted - joining the 271st Brigade of the Royal Field Artillery. And that December, just two days after finishing school, Vernon was on active service as second lieutenant. Father and son began preparing the family's horses, Cupid, Flashlight, Polly and Nimrod, for battle - readying defences on the English coast in case of a German invasion. Birthday present: Cupid, pictured with a stable hand, was bought for Vernon Laurie as a gift from his father in 1911. Just three years later, the horse was trained for battle and joined British forces on the Essex coast . It marked the start of a remarkable journey that lasted more than four years and saw the Lauries and their horses travelling thousands of miles to serve on the front line. Together, the men and their horses faced the horrors of conflict together. They trudged through the muddy fields of France; dragged guns across the Sinai Desert in the sweltering heat; and survived gunfire on the Gaza battlefields. Now, through a moving collection of letters sent back and forth from her owner, as well as touching photographs and candid diary entries, Cupid's incredible story has been told for the first time. In his new book, Cupid's War, Martin Laurie, a retired farmer from Essex, charts how his grandfather, Vernon, and great-grandfather, Randal, travelled from Romford to Beirut with their horses. The book offers touching insight into the bond between man and beast and sheds light on the lives of millions of courageous animals who fought alongside soldiers in the war. Mr Laurie said: 'Cupid was one of millions of horses from both sides that went to war. Loyal: Two of the Lauries' horses, Cupid and Polly, pictured during their service in the First World War. Their journey is told in a new book that draws on letters, photographs and diary entries from the front line . Posted: Horses are loaded on to a train in England, before they are sent to the front line overseas. The Lauries trudged through the fields of France, pulled guns through the Sinai Desert and dodged bullets in Palestine . Service: A British battleship on the Suez Canal, where the Lauries' and their horses were posted in 1916. The battery, stationed near the Pyramids for months, were ready to fight of a potential Turkish onslaught . And added that 'it is reasonable to suggest that the war could not have been fought' without the horses' 'courage, loyalty and hard work'. Shortly after war was declared, Lt Col Laurie bought 131 horses to add to the number of family animals. They were dispatched to the Essex coast and, after further training, the group sailed from Southampton to France in November 1915. The horses and the soldiers who met in England would became 'old friends', Mr Laurie writes. The men looked after the horses, trained with them, and nursed them through the horrors of war. The Lauries' journey echoes the plot of War Horse, the Michael Morpurgo novel that has been adapted into an award-winning play and film in which a teenager from Devon and his horse, Joey, are both put to use on the Western Front. Brutal: Living under the intense heat of the Egyptian sun took its toll on both humans and horses in Cupid's battery, pictured together in April 1916 - three months after they arrived in the country . Vital: Camels were among a number of animals that were vital in helping the British troops survive in Egypt . Action: Cupid's battery saw their first real action of the war when they were stationed in Gaza in 1917. Above, what remains of a tank that was destroyed during a conflict in the Palestinian desert . But while Joey sees the worst of the action in France, the Lauries and their horses escaped the worst of it and were posted to Egypt in January 1916. Conditions on the journey across were terrible, and Nimrod was one of several horses to collapse on the second day at sea from lack of water and food. He could not be cajoled to his feet again, and had to be shot. The battery spent months stationed near the Pyramids - ready to fight of an expected Turkish assault on the Suez Canal. There, the young men, who had arrived from a freezing English winter, battled to stay healthy in the intense Egyptian heat. But they were also concerned for the well-being of their horses. Long way from home: Flashlight, one of the Laurie family horses, is watered at one of the desert camps . 'Old friends': By the time the war ended, those on the horse lines, like the ones pictured above, had become very attached to the animals. The British Government declared that no horses were to return after the war . An extract from the book reads:  'Some of the horses’ noses would also burn and the men would rub a lanolin lotion onto the burns… the men would try anything to keep their horses comfortable.' The horses were also plagued by flies and Cupid was given a specially-designed fly fringe - another small act to keep him comfortable. From Egypt, the battery were given orders to advance on Gaza, where both the men and their horses saw their first major action of the war at the First Battle of Gaza, in March 1917. At the end of the campaign, only 22 of the 60 horses that Vernon had brought from Essex had survived - and Cupid was one of them. Caring: Cupid was given a specially-issued fly fringe to help keep her comfortable while serving in Egypt . When war was declared over on 11 November 1918, the men were stationed in Beruit. Martin Laurie recreates the scene: 'Ships’ hooters boomed out, bells began to ring and the men began to shout and sing. 'Up on the hills fires were lit and all sense of army discipline seemed to vanish – news had arrived that an armistice had been signed with Germany … . 'The sense of celebration was overwhelming. The men who were at the horse lines stopped their work, and many of the horses were just left to roam about. 'The men embraced each other, they embraced the horses, they danced jigs and sang songs….the celebrations were to last all night.' Essential: Horses drag British guns across the Sinai Desert - the only way the weapons could have been moved . But while the surviving men were gradually being demobbed home, the fate of their brave and loyal horses was not decided for some months. The Lt Col wrote home: 'One feels marooned up here, no roads or railway to the base, a rotten little harbour which makes it almost impossible to ship horses and guns from here. 'They will not I am sure ship any of these horses home, if they get them to Egypt they’ll turn them into hides and tallow, if we leave them here we will have to shoot the lot.' Despite the difficulties, Vernon’s father continued to try and find a way of getting Cupid home, but as time went by this seemed less and less likely. In February 1919, the Government decided that none of the horses from Egypt would be brought back. Randal wrote to his son on 24th February 1919: 'I have bad news to tell you, for I have had to destroy poor old Cupid; she had a frightful set to with a wandering mule at night, was horribly mauled, in fact I am not sure she hadn’t a broken leg. 'She didn’t suffer long; we had 3 vets, & decided to shoot her.' The Lt Col instructed a veterinary sergeant to clean out Cupid's shoe, which was sent back to Britain and mounted as a brass doorstop, and a 'permanent memory of the little horse', which Mr Laurie still uses today. Cupid's War by Martin Laurie (Memoirs Publishing, £12.99) is available to order now.","Vernon Laurie was given Cupid, a mare, as 15th birthday present in 1911 .

"A young woman chef at a leading restaurant was ‘groped’ and teased about her breasts by the all-male kitchen staff, an employment tribunal heard yesterday. Chloe Maisey, 19, claims she was ogled every day as she changed into her uniform at the restaurant of celebrity chef Stephen Terry, who was best man at Gordon Ramsay’s wedding. She also claims staff rubbed fish in her face, threw a mouse at her across the kitchen, shut her in a freezer and sprayed hot water over her. Hearing: Chloe Maisey, left, told a tribunal that she was suffered sexual discrimination at a restaurant run by Gordon Ramsay's best man, Stephen Terry, right . ‘I felt like they targeted me because I was the only girl in the kitchen,’ she said. Mr Terry, 47, a regular on TV shows such as the BBC’s Saturday Kitchen, denies sex discrimination at his Hardwick restaurant in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, which is regularly named the best in Wales. Miss Maisey, who is pregnant, said she had been delighted to be made a trainee pastry chef for Mr Terry, who trained under Marco Pierre White and was awarded a Michelin star at the age of 25. Highly acclaimed: The Hardwick  restaurant near Abergavenny, where Ms Maisey claims she was discriminated against . But she claimed it turned into a nightmare of sexual discrimination. ‘There were no female changing rooms, so I was forced to change in front of the male chefs every day,’ she said. ‘I would turn around and they would all be watching me. They stared at me constantly and made comments about my body. They called me fat and made comments about my boobs.’ She described how she was groped by saying: ‘A male colleague slapped my bum.’ The teenager said her male colleagues ‘intimidated’ her. ‘They told me I would get a job flipping burgers at McDonald’s if I did not do as they said.’ The chefs were referred to during the hearing only by their nicknames. None of the nicknames referred to Mr Terry. Miss Maisey, of Pontyclun, South Wales, also claimed male staff had poured salt and pepper into her hair and put earwigs into a saucepan to scare her. Claims: Ms Maisey, pictured at the hearing in Cardiff, left, said that at one point a male colleague slapped her bum. Pictured right is Stephen Terry, the owner of the restaurant, who denies the allegations . Telling how one colleague had shut her inside the freezer, she said: ‘He shut the lid on me and I could not get out. I was really scared and upset. I was so shocked he had done it to me.’ She claims she was deliberately burned on the arm with a hot tray and squirted with hot water from a hose used to clean the oven. ‘The water burned my back through my chef’s whites. It felt like my back was on fire. When I fell over, everyone laughed.’ Miss Maisey told the Cardiff tribunal: ‘There were no other female members of staff in the kitchen that I could turn to for help.’ Asked why she did not report the incidents to Mr Terry, she replied: ‘It was the first job I had been in and I thought that was what happened. ‘I did not know who to go to or who to tell. I was ashamed of what was happening to me and I did not want to tell anyone.’ She quit last August after three months. Her mother Pauline said her daughter called her after her last shift, adding: ‘She was distraught. It took me a long time to calm her down. She was hysterical.’ 'Distraught': Ms Maisey's mother said that her . daughter (above), who resigned from the position at The Hardwick last . August, said that on one occasion she was hysterical after returning . from work . Mrs Maisey said Mr Terry did not deal adequately with her complaints about her daughter’s colleagues. Mr Terry, who denies 21 allegations of sexual discrimination, said many of the alleged incidents were ‘banter’ among colleagues in a high-pressure kitchen. He added: ‘If she was so distressed about all these incidents then she could have told me about just one of them. But at no point ever did she tell me about any of these alleged incidents.’ The first he heard of any sexual discrimination was when Miss Maisey’s mother rang him. He said he asked her to put the allegations in writing but she never did. He said there had been more than 100 female employees at the Hardwick ‘and this is something completely new to us’. The tribunal continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Chloe Maisey, 19, claims she suffered discrimination at a restaurant in Wales .

"Dean Shiels admits Rangers are happy to win ugly as long as it keeps them in touch with Scottish Championship rivals Hearts. Last month's 2-0 defeat to the Tynecastle outfit has left Ally McCoist's side with a nine-point gap to bridge if they want to lift the title. But while Hearts were flamboyantly scoring four goals past Queen of the South at home, Rangers stumbled to a joyless 1-0 win over Cowdenbeath at Ibrox. Rangers midfielder Dean Shiels celebrates after scoring the winner against Cowdenbeath . Shiels is congratulated by team-mate Kenny Miller after scoring what turned out to be the winning goal . A drab affair was only enlightened briefly when Cowdenbeath defender Nat Wedderburn turned Shiels' cross into his own net 13 minutes after half-time. It was far from pretty but the Northern Irishman was just happy not to lose any further ground to the table-topping Gorgie men. He told the official Rangers website: 'The most important thing was getting the win - we can't afford to drop any more points. 'Especially at home we want to be winning our games, we had to grind it out and thankfully we did that. 'The game should have been a lot easier for us and a lot easier for the fans - that would only have come from us taking our chances and making the game ours. Rangers' Kris Boyd and Cowdenbeath's Nat Wedderburn tussle for the ball . 'We shouldn't have given the opposition as much of a look-in towards the end and we dropped deep and got a wee bit nervy. 'That is sometimes the natural instinct when you're defending a 1-0 lead but we shouldn't have been in that position. 'If you don't take your second and third chances then it does become difficult for the team and you could sense that.' The 29-year-old came in to replace the injured Lewis Macleod for just his third start of the season. His reintroduction was the only change to the side which suffered Wednesday's humiliating 3-2 defeat to Alloa in the Petrofac Training Cup semi-final. Shiels played 80 minutes of that match after Macleod was stretchered off with a hamstring tear and was given the full 90 against the Blue Brazil. He was far from the worst performer in either encounter but know he will have to continue making his mark or he will find himself relegated to the bench once more. Rangers' Lee McCulloch climbs above the defence to direct a header at goal . 'I haven't had much game time so when I do get a chance to play I try and make as much of an impact as I can and thankfully I've managed to do that against Cowden,' he said. 'There is a lot of competition for places and when you do get your chance you need to make an impact. 'You have to take your chance when it comes and I try and work my socks off in training. 'I got a good lay off from Kenny Miller for the goal, I've ran off him and I just tried to stick it in the area and thankfully it's gone in. 'I'll be grand come Friday for Queen of the South, I've got five or six days to recover I'm not quite that stiff - I'd love to play again.'","Dean Shiels scored winner for Rangers against Cowdenbeath on Saturday .

"Dean Shiels relieved some of the pressure on under-fire boss Ally McCoist as his second-half winner handed Rangers a narrow 1-0 win over Cowdenbeath at Ibrox. The vultures have been circling McCoist ever since his side slumped to a shock 3-2 defeat to part-time Alloa on Wednesday. But while his side again looked anything but assertive, Shiels' 58th-minute strike did hand the manager some much-needed breathing space. Rangers midfielder Dean Shiels celebrates after scoring the winner against Cowdenbeath . McCoist can still feel the sting of the Wasps' Petrofac Training Cup semi-final but he has already insisted he will not walk away from the job until he leads the Glasgow giants back to the Scottish Premiership. But the fans who once idolised him during his days as a record-breaking frontman are quickly losing faith in his management. That was evident by the size of the 28,137 crowd - the lowest league attendance at Ibrox since Greame Souness was just starting to make his mark as Gers boss in December 1986. Despite such a woeful performance in midweek, McCoist made just one change for Cowden's first league visit to Ibrox since September 1970 - and even that was enforced as Shiels replaced the injured Lewis Macleod. Rangers' Kris Boyd and Cowdenbeath's Nat Wedderburn tussle for the ball . Rangers had plenty of decent possession in the first half but failed to make the most of it as time and again the final ball let them down. The first time they got in behind the Fifers was after 11 minutes but Shiels arrived too late to connect with a low cross swept in by Kenny Miller. When they did carve Cowdenbeath open, the men in blue seemed to suffer a collective rush of blood to the head. Miller's cushioned cut-back into the danger zone seemed perfect for Kris Boyd, but the striker got the ball caught under his feet. When it squirmed out to Sheils, he crashed it onto the post when he should have netted. Miller was in again moments later but tried to be unselfish and square for Boyd. His generosity, though, only allowed Nat Wedderburn time to recover and then clear the danger. It was becoming another ragged display and the Ibrox crowd responded with an angry groan. A faint chant of ""Super Ally"" could be heard from one corner of the ground - but it was the one housing the Blue Brazil's supporters. Rangers' Lee McCulloch climbs above the defence to direct a header at goal . The groans developed into outright jeers as the home team trudged off at the interval. But within 13 minutes of the second period starting, Shiels finally gave the Gers faithful something to cheer. A chipped ball by Richard Foster up for Miller was nodded down perfectly into Shiels' path. The former Kilmarnock forward took a touch to set himself and then calmly rolled the ball past visiting keeper Robbie Thomson for the opener. While Shiels was enjoying his first start since the end of September, Boyd was having another afternoon to forget. He had snatched at a couple of chances in the first period then missed an even easier one as Shiels sent him through on goal, mishitting the ball when he had just Thomson to beat. And he bore a frustrated look as he was replaced by Jon Daly with 22 minutes left. By then, a deflated atmosphere had fallen over the stadium. But Darren McGregor had to act decisively to prevent another outburst of fury from the Rangers fans as he beat Sean Higgins to a header just as it looked like the Cowden striker was shaping to score. Miller was presented with his big chance to score as Foster picked him out in the box. But he needed an extra touch and found himself crowded out by Wedderburn again. Rangers should have added to their lead in the final few moments. Daly, though, headed over the bar, while Nicky Clark saw Thomson pull off a fine save with the last kick of the game.","Dean Shiels' 58th-minute strike handed manager Ally McCoist some much-needed breathing space .

"The axe-wielding radical Muslim who hacked two cops in Queens two week ago spent months viewing jihadist material online and stalked police  for hours before launching his attack, it is claimed. Detectives piecing together the life of Zale Thompson, 32, say in the nine months before his attack on October 23 he visited 277 websites to do with ISIS, beheadings, Al Qaeda, and jihad. Thompson was shot dead after running up to four officers in New York brandishing a hatchet, before wounding cop Kenneth Healey, 25, in the head, and slashing another in the arm. Mr Healey was taken to hospital on in critical condition but has now been released. WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES . Officers piecing together the life of New York hatchet attacker Zale Thompson (pictured) say he visited 277 websites to do with ISIS, beheadings and jihad before attacking cops two weeks ago . Investigators say Thompson stalked cops for hours in New York before launching his assault as they were having their pictures taken - wounding Kenneth Healey (second left) in the head . Mr Healey, a rookie who had been on the force for just four months before he was injured, was taken to hospital in critical condition but has since recovered . Officers have also discovered CCTV footage which shows that Thompson stalked his victims for hours before deciding on the perfect moment to strike, according to ABC. An anonymous police source told the site: 'There’s video, very distant, about two blocks up, that shows him at the top of the frame. 'He stays there about two minutes. Then he bends over and bolts, charges down the street, charging at the cops with the ax. You can see him watching, down the block.' Investigators said this dismisses concerns that a man photographing the four cops seconds before the attack had set them up, as Thompson simply used the distraction to his advantage. Officers have also discovered a manifesto on Thompson's computer, in which he details his hatred of the government and desire to attack an establishment figure. In it, he writes: 'Seek them out, watch them and then attack them. Chop off the head of the beast. If we can’t do it ""there,"" we have to do it here.' Thompson can be seen dead on the street, face up in a green coat, moments after attacking the officers. Kenneth Healey is laying face down with a hatchet gash in his head . An officer attends to Healey, pressing a cloth against his wound, as the other officers train their weapons at Thompson. Healey remains in critical condition at a New York hospital . Mr Healey, his head and left hand bandaged, left hospital last Wednesday to cheers from his fellow officers - and even managed to step out of his wheelchair and walk into a waiting ambulance. He is now in a therapy centre where he will complete his physio treatment before rejoining the force. Chilling pictures taken seconds before the October 23 attacks show Mr Healy standing along with four fellow officers before they were attacked by Thompson. Dominick Williams took the photos after spotting the officers and asking them to stand for a picture. Seconds later, Thompson ran up to the cops - who where standing against a wall in Jamaica, Queens - and started swinging a sharp hand axe. Mr Williams says he scrambled for safety as the officers wrestled with Thompson. He hacked Officer Joseph Meeker, 24, in the arm before burying the hatchet in Healey's skull. Thompson still holds his hatchet in his hand after being shot dead by two NYPD officers after he slashed two cops in an ambush attack . Mr Williams' camera captured the frantic aftermath of the attack. Officer Healey - who had just four months on the job - can be seen laying face down on the sidewalk - a bloody gash in his head. Another officer can be seen tending to his fallen comrade, holding a cloth over the head wound. The pictures also capture Thompson dead on the sidewalk. His body is face up with the hatchet, still in his had, laid across his chest. NYPD top brass has called the attack 'an act of terrorism.' Thompson was a self-radicalized Muslim extremist who had an interest in ISIS beheadings. His family described him as a 'recluse' with mental health problems.","Zale Thompson, 32, attacked cops in Jamaica, Queens, two weeks ago .

"One of the men suspected of beheading American journalist Daniel Pearl more than a decade ago has been released from a Pakistani jail. Qari Hashim Ali, who had been detained since August 2005, walked free from the Hyderabad central jail on Friday after an anti-terrorist court said there was not enough evidence to hold him. 'It is a great victory for truth and my client,' defense counsel, Sher Muhammad Leghari said, the Indian Express reported. 'We had filed an acquittal plea... arguing that there was no evidence.' Pearl, the South Asia bureau chief at the Wall Street Journal, vanished in Karachi in January 2002. A month later authorities received video footage of him being beheaded.

"A newlywed couple gave up their honeymoon to make their second appearance on the Jeremy Kyle show the day after their wedding - after the bride was accused of cheating. Emma and Daniel Cowley got engaged after a whirlwind romance and a proposal over Skype, but their nuptials looked set to be cancelled after she accused him of cheating on her at a party. Mr Cowley, 29, agreed to appear on Jeremy Kyle to take a lie detector test - which he failed. But Mrs Cowley forgave him and the marriage went ahead regardless. Scroll down for video . Emma and Daniel Cowley got engaged after a whirlwind romance and a wedding proposal over Skype - but their wedding, pictured, looked set to be cancelled after she accused him of cheating on her at a party . But the while the bride was preparing her make-up and hair for the big day, rumours emerged that she too had been unfaithful. So the day after their wedding, the couple decided to delay their honeymoon and instead appear on the ITV show again to take their second lie detector test. Thankfully, Mrs Cowley, 22, passed the test and proved she had not cheated on her husband. She said: 'It wasn't ideal. Like most brides I wanted to be enjoying married life with my hubby but felt we couldn't move on properly until I'd proven I hadn't cheated. 'The day after our wedding should have been one of the best days of my life, but instead we spent it on the show being grilled by Jeremy. 'I didn't want to go back on the show but I needed to put Daniel's mind at rest so we could both move on with our life and put the past behind us. Mrs Cowley accused her fiance of cheating on her at a party and took him to the Jeremy Kyle show, pictured, to find out the truth . Mr Cowley, 29, agreed to take a lie detector test on the ITV daytime show - which he failed. But Mrs Cowley forgave him and the wedding went ahead regardless . 'We put our honeymoon on hold and went to Wales two weeks later. Today, we're happier than ever.' The couple met while on holiday in 2013 but Mr Cowley was already in a relationship. The pair had a long distance relationship - he lived in Manchester and she lives in Ashford, Kent - until Mr Cowley popped the question over Skype on Christmas Eve 2013. Mrs Cowley recalled: 'There was an instant attraction but Daniel was in a relationship. 'I didn't want to be a home-wrecker and it was important to me we started on a clean slate and his relationship was over before we started one. '[When he proposed] I was over the moon. I couldn't believe it when he got down on one knee over Skype and asked me to marry him. However, rumours soon emerged that she had also been unfaithful - so the couple took the bizarre decision to delay their honeymoon and instead appear on the show to take their second lie detector test . Luckily Mrs Cowley (pictured on her second Jeremy Kyle appearance - during her honeymoon) passed the test . 'It was so romantic and I said yes straightaway. All my family were in the room cheering. Like me, they were really pleased too and thought Daniel was a good egg. 'Even though we hadn't been together that long, they knew how much I loved him. I couldn't wait to start planning the wedding.' But her happiness was short-lived when she got a Facebook message from her new fiancé's ex saying he had cheated on her at a New Year's Eve party, just days after the proposal. Though Daniel denied the rumours, the messages continued, so Emma applied for a lie detector test on the Jeremy Kyle show in March 2014. The results revealed that unemployed Daniel had in fact been unfaithful and was guilty of kissing and groping his ex-girlfriend. In spite of the results, Emma decided to stand by her man and they tied the knot just one month later, in April 2014. Mrs Cowley passed the test - proving that she had not been unfaithful - and the couple, pictured signing the marriage register, say the show helped to solve their problems once and for all . However in the days leading up to the ceremony, Daniel received a number of Facebook messages messages claiming Emma had been cheating. The ceremony went ahead as planned, but while Emma was having her make-up done she received a call from a Jeremy Kyle researcher who asked how the relationship was going. She explained the cheating rumours and they were offered a lie detector test the next day, which they accepted. The pair drove back to Manchester the following day, cancelling their planned honeymoon in Wales, where Emma took a lie detector test. The results revealed Emma, who has a five-year-old daughter from a previous relationship, was found to be faithful. Full-time mother Emma said: 'I didn't want to go back on the show but I needed to put Daniel's mind at rest. Today, we're happier than ever.' Chef Daniel, who has now moved to Ashford to live with Emma, added: 'I'm so glad Emma gave me a second chance. I love her to bits and won't mess up again.'","Emma and Daniel Cowley got engaged after a whirlwind romance .

"The troubled son of Dynasty star Kate O’Mara hanged himself after she asked him to move out of her home, an inquest heard yesterday. It is thought Dickon O’Mara had been dead for up to three weeks  when his body was discovered on  New Year’s Eve, just days before his 50th birthday. He had spiralled into a life of drink and drug abuse after suffering brain damage when he was run over three years earlier, the court heard. In a final text to his mother he wrote: ‘I wish the car that hit me was going faster.’ Dickon O'Mara, the troubled son of Dynasty acress Kate O'Mara, was found hanged in a garage of her home, an inquest has heard . The inquest heard he appeared to have been sleeping in the garage of his mother’s home after she asked him to leave her cottage two months earlier because she could no longer cope with his behaviour. By then, the 73-year-old actress had been hospitalised with pneumonia. She was still too ill to attend yesterday’s inquest. The unemployed theatre technician had been hit by a car in January 2010 and suffered brain injuries which affected his balance and left him unable to work. Miss O’Mara later bought a property in Long Marston, Warwickshire, in the hope her son could obtain work at the Royal Shakespeare Company in nearby Stratford-upon-Avon. But he struggled to find a job. Detective Constable Philip Hewish told the court that Mr O’Mara ‘struggled to cope’ with his mother’s diagnosis of pneumonia in September ‘and his drinking became worse’. Mr O'Mara's Godmother Patricia Purkiss (left, with Belinda Cochrane, right, Kate O'Mara's sister, leaving the inquest today) said his mother loved him dearly. Pictured right is Mr O'Mara as a boy with his mother . Police were called to an argument between the pair at her cottage in October, which led to her renting a home for him in Stratford. The following month, a friend of Mr O’Mara’s contacted police after he texted her with the message: ‘It’s time to die.’ He was found ‘safe and well’ in the town by police, the hearing at the Warwickshire Justice Centre in Leamington Spa was told. His final contact with his mother came in a flurry of texts he sent in December. One said: ‘I hope you are OK? I can text or email. Write to me if you so wish. XX’. Alan Purkiss, husband of Patricia Purkiss, leaving the inquest at Warwickshire Justice Centre today . Another simply said: ‘Get better, get well XX,’ while in a third he revealed he was staying in a hostel for a night. The final message, on December 8, hinted at Mr O’Mara’s state of mind. He wrote: ‘I wish the ******* car that hit me was going faster.’ He was discovered hanged from a beam in his mother’s garage by a neighbour. It appeared he had been living there secretly and he had made himself a makeshift bed from workbenches and a mattress. Dickon O'Mara was found hanged in a garage near his home (pictured) Sean McGovern, coroner for Coventry and Warwickshire, said he suspected that Mr O’Mara died a short time  after he sent his final text to his mother. Patricia Purkiss, Mr O’Mara’s godmother and a close friend of  his mother for more than 40 years,  said Miss O’Mara had been texting her son after that message ‘but there was no response’. She said: ‘His mother loved him dearly and she fought like a tiger for him but in the end she was too ill to fight.’ Miss O’Mara’s sister, Belinda Cochrane, told the coroner her nephew was a ‘lovely person’ but had been a ‘very troubled soul for a very long time’ and had ‘wasted’ his talent. Mrs Cochrane said she was certain he had committed suicide because he had ‘threatened it so much, for so long’. The inquest heard Mr O’Mara had attempted suicide twice before – once by hanging in 1994 and again in 2003 when he attempted to gas himself. There was no evidence of drink or drugs in his system when he died. The coroner recorded a verdict of suicide.

"Faleh Ghazi Albasman, 59, confessed to stabbing his 24-year-old daughter to death, saying he was 'boiling with anger' after she 'disrespected' him . A Kuwaiti father who brought his daughter to the UK to learn English murdered her in an 'honour killing' when he found her using a mobile phone. Faleh Ghazi Albasman, 59, stabbed 24-year-old Mashael in the neck 13 times in the flat that they shared in Bournemouth, before picking up another blade and wounding himself in the stomach. After being taken to hospital, Albasman spoke Arabic to a surgeon, asking him what the penalty for honour killings were in Britain, before telling him: 'it's all about the honour'. Albasman confessed that he was 'boiling with anger' when he attacked his daughter, saying she had been 'disrespectful' to him and told him 'to go home', Winchester Crown Court heard. The final straw came when he found her talking on a mobile phone, saying that her behaviour had become ‘inappropriate in my culture’. The court heard Albasman had come over to Bournemouth, Dorset, with Mashael in November 2013 to be her 'chaperone'. She had started an English language course in the seaside town, just before she was found dead by paramedics on March 30 this year. Kerry Maylin, prosecuting, said: 'Mashael Albasman was killed due to multiple stab wounds, 13 in all, mainly concentrated on the neck. 'The stab wounds were likely to have been inflicted by Mr Albasman standing behind her. 'He was arrested on suspicion of murder and taken to Southampton General Hospital due to his own injuries. He was seen by medical staff including Mr Ahmed, a consultant surgeon who spoke Arabic. 'Mr Ahmed told Mr Albasman that he would translate what he was told to the police and Mr Albasman said he understood and at one point told the surgeon ""I have finished her"". 'When asked who the ""her"" was, he said his daughter, Mashael. He asked Mr Ahmed a number of times ""what’s the law here in context to murder for honour?"" 'He repeated on a number of occasions ""tell them it’s honour, it’s about honour"". 'He maintained in his final interview that Mashael had been very disrespectful, she had been talking on her phone and he maintained that was inappropriate in his culture. 'He said ""I was so angry. Boiling with anger. She said to me go back. A girl should not treat good men like me, decent men in this way"". 'I hated Mashael, how dare she talk to me in that way. I was so angry, upset and mentally low. Mashael broke my heart. He agreed by killing her had preserved his honour.' Mashael was found  dead inside this block of flats in Bournemouth. Albasman was rushed to hospital after stabbing himself with a knife, where he told a surgeon 'tell them it's honour, it's about honour' Dr El-Khayad, a forensic psychiatrist, gave evidence today and said Albasman was involved road traffic accident which happened when he was in his 20s, leaving him in a coma with a ‘significant impairment of his IQ’. Glenn Harris, defending, said: 'The defendant understands that he has committed a serious offence and he understands by pleading guilty he accepts causing his daughter’s death. 'This was a tragic incident.' Judge Nigel Teare did not give Albasman a custodial sentence, but instead sentenced him to an indefinite hospital order. He said: 'You have pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of your daughter, Mashael Albasman. 'Police were called to the property, you opened the door and your daughter was found with 13 stab wounds in her neck. 'She was declared deceased by a paramedic. Your guilty plea of manslaughter has been accepted by the prosecution. 'Psychiatrists who have examined you have concluded that you were suffering from a medical condition called paranoid psychosis. 'This was possibly caused by a Road Traffic Accident when you were in your 20s which left you in a coma. You felt she was disrespectful to you and was acting inappropriately. 'It is appropriate for you to be detained in a medical hospital for treatment. 'The effect of that order is that you will only be discharged from hospital with the consent of the Secretary of State. 'There will therefore be a hospital order with a restriction order, unlimited in time.' Albasman, who was emotionless in the dock, was then marched out flanked by hospital staff and security guards. He will return to a medium security hospital called Ravenswood House. Albasman was sent to a secure mental hospital indefinitely for the attack, after the court heard a car crash while he was in his 20s had left him with brain damage .","Faleh Ghazi Albasman, 59, confessed to murdering daughter Mashael, 24 .

"Geoff Langdale defrauded his 28 victims out of a total of £2.3million, which he then spent on his  business, investments and access to porn . An accountant who ran an elaborate, decade-long 'Ponzi' scam has been jailed for six years for conning 28 investors out of £2.3million. Geoff Langdale, 63, gained his victims' trust before encouraging them to hand over their cash so he could invest it for them. But instead he squandered thousands of pounds on adult websites, including a Russian dancer's webcam, and used clients' cash to keep his own business going. Several of the 63-year-old's 28 victims - who lived across North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, Lancashire, Cumbria, Derbyshire, Greater Manchester, Suffolk and North Wales - attended Bradford Crown Court today to see him jailed for the scam which had resulted in an outstanding loss of just over £1.1m. Prosecutor Alasdair Campbell told the court how Langdale, who was struck off as a chartered accountant in 2009, dishonestly obtained more than £2.3million from would-be investors between 2002 and 2013 - while around £1.1m was repaid through the scheme. But Mr Campbell said Langdale, who was arrested in June last year after his criminal activities came to light, had been 'robbing Peter to pay Paul'. Mr Campbell said Langdale had been operating a classic 'Ponzi' scheme, in which he promised investors a good rate of interest and had created documentation which was intended to satisfy clients that their investments were safe. Instead of investing his clients' money as promised, he used more than £1m to prop up his own companies, including investing in a chemical company that later collapsed. As his debt spiralled out of control, he encouraged more people to invest in the scam. The court heard how Langdale spent £6,000 on adult websites during 2009 and 2010 and Mr Campbell said he had also withdrawn nearly £130,000 in cash. 'The Crown will never know where that money has gone,' said Mr Campbell. A widow, who has since died herself, 'invested' more than £130,000 and was left completely devastated by the loss of their hard-earned money. During his police interview Langdale said his wife and staff were not aware of the fraud and Mr Campbell said the defendant's wife had subsequently filed for divorce. Langdale, who had no previous convictions, pleaded guilty to charges of obtaining money transfers by deception and fraud. Christopher Evans, for the defence, said Langdale's reputation was now in tatters and he accepted that he would deservedly leave prison penniless. Mr Evans said Langdale regretted his behaviour and had taken steps to ensure his victims would get as much money back as possible. Several of Langdale's victims arrived at Bradford Crown Court to see him jailed for six years (file picture) Judge David Hatton QC told Langdale that the individuals and organisations had been targeted by him and they had invested their trust in him as an honest, responsible and reliable professional. 'You were in the event none of those things,' said the judge. 'Over the period of 11 years you dishonestly obtained £2.3million and there is to this day a loss of just over £1million, monies that those individuals and institutions badly need. 'Funds were used to satisfy your own needs and your own proclivities. Some of it was used for your own business expenses. Other funds have simply disappeared in cash one knows not where. 'I've read a number of statements from your victims. In many, if not most cases, there has been financial catastrophe and also emotional devastation.' The judge added that Langdale had fabricated documents to keep his victims at bay. Detective Sergeant Andy Kenyon of North Yorkshire Police's Major Fraud Team, said: 'Geoffrey Langdale was a trusted accountant in a small community and used his position to commit fraud. His dishonesty has had a lasting impact on many victims whose financial future has now been left in ruins and they are now facing financial hardship as a result of these crimes.' Debra Chan, from the CPS, said: 'Over a period of 11 years Geoffrey Langdale abused his position as a trusted accountant while his victims, reassured by the reputation of his long-standing accountancy practice, were encouraged to invest money in his fraudulent 'Ponzi' scheme. 'He fooled genuine investors by producing fraudulent documents and forging company logos to imply their money was safe. 'This conviction highlights Geoffrey Langdale's dishonesty and the blatant disregard for the welfare of his clients.' Langdale, of Bentham, North Yorks., will now face further investigation under the Proceeds of Crime Act in an effort to recoup some of the stolen money from any of his remaining assets.","Geoff Langdale's elaborate Ponzi scheme ran for more than a decade .

"One of Hitler's former SS henchman who rounded up Jews at the notorious Auschwitz concentration camp has insisted that he is a victim - after his pension was cut by £47 a month. Jakob Wendel, 91, complained that he was being punished 70 years after the Holocaust and said that he bears no responsibility or guilt for his role in the atrocity. A law was passed making it possible to dock the pensions of those who violated 'principles of humanity' during the period of Nazi rule. Jakob Wendel, 91, complained that he was being punished 70 years after the Holocaust and insisted that he bears no responsibility or guilt for his role in the atrocity . Wendel, who served just five years for the part he played in the mass exterminations, spoke to a German magazine about his role unloading the trains at Auschwitz on condition of anonymity. But The Sun has named the former Nazi, and he complained to the newspaper about losing the £47 of his pension. He said: 'I was a victim of the regime too. 'I was robbed of ten years of my life by the German army. Around here, not many people know about it - I don't want them to know about it. 'Why should I be held responsible after 70 years?' Wendel was posted at Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp for two and a half years until 1945 . The father-of-three now lives with his wife in a large apartment on an affluent estate near Stuttgart, in southern Germany. He was one of 30 surviving Nazis targeted in 2013 as accessories to multiple murder, because the former SS man's role in the the selection committee at Auschwitz was deemed so significant. But German prosecutors were forced to abandon the case last month because Wendel had already served five years over the part he played in the Holocaust after he was sentenced by a  Polish court in 1948. The infamous Auschwitz concentration camp was originally used to house Polish political prisoners, but from spring 1942, it became the largest site for the murder of Jews . The punishment would have been greater but Jewish survivors sent to identify their captors after the war did not pick him out from the ranks of PoWs. Wendel, who is originally from Germany grew up near Belgrade, Yugoslavia, and was drafted into the SS in 1942 when he was 19. He was posted at Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp for two and a half years until 1945. The former Nazi avoided justice in the 1970s when he lied to prosecutors and failed to mention he was part of the selection committee at Auschwitz. The infamous Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp was originally used to house Polish political prisoners, but from spring 1942, it became the largest site for the murder of Jews. More than 1.1 million men, women, and children lost their lives there. But Wendel remained unrepentant when he spoke to The Sun. More than 1.1 million men, women, and children lost their lives at the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland . He said: 'I sleep soundly because I did not do anything wrong. I knew it was a gas chamber. I never saw what happened inside, but you knew what they were. 'Many people arrived in trains and no one left. I never saw how they were killed in there but I knew no one came out. 'I can remember the smoke and the smell. I knew it was people burning. I never thought it was good, but I couldn't do anything.' Campaigners last night called for him to pay for the crimes he committed at the concentration camp. Dr Efraim Zuroff, of the Simon Wiesenthal Center human rights organisation, said: 'I would like to see him put on trial and to end his miserable life in a prison cell.'","Former SS guard Jakob Wendel, 91, claims he was a victim of the regime too .

"Tourism in Ireland has experienced a boost thanks to Hollywood... and Westeros. While Northern Ireland has been a hot destination for Game of Thrones fans keen to tour key filming locations in recent years, the Republic of Ireland has also experienced a  boost since Kim Kardashian and Kanye West spent their honeymoon in the country in May. Tourism Minister Paschal Donohoe has revealed that visitors to Ireland from Great Britain have increased by 11.3 per cent, with an extra 178,200 visitors on last year. A spokesperson for Tourism Ireland tells MailOnline that forecasts indicate that  Ireland will welcome 8.5 million overseas visitors in 2014, an eight per cent increase over 2013. Scroll down for video . Honeymooners: Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are pictured visiting local cinemas twice during their holiday in Ireland following their May wedding . Hollywood effect: Both Game of Thrones and Kim and Kanye's honeymoon have boosted visitor numbers to Ireland, says the tourism minister . Film tours: Fans of the show book tours of locations to follow in the footsteps of their favourite characters from the hit HBO series . As well as the tourist board's regular marketing efforts, Donohue has attributed the rise to the extra publicity the cult show and celebrity touch has provided. Game of Thrones films in a number of locations throughout Northern Ireland. It has become a popular destination for serious fans wishing to visit the real life Winterfell,  King's Road,  Pyke and  Iron Islands, among others. Travel companies have capitalised on its popularity, with several running regular Game of Thrones tours from Dublin and Belfast. Speaking of the hit HBO series, he told TTG Digital: 'When I was in the US recently, I noticed that there were a huge number of Irish companies advertising Game of Thrones tours to US tour operators – there is no doubt that it has helped. Landscape: Murlough Bay in County Antrim has provided the backdrop for several GOT scenes, including  Theon Greyjoy's homecoming to the Iron Islands . Location, location: Castle Ward in County Down was used for some exterior shots of Winterfell . 'I’m a big fan of the books myself,' he added, 'and they’ve been a great boost to tourism.' More recently, the Republic of Ireland has seen a rise in interest after it emerged that Kim Kardashian and Kanye West spent a quiet few days there  in May. The couple jetted to Ireland from their wedding in Florence and holed up in luxury properties in County Limerick and County Laois. During their time there the reality star and rapper stayed at both Ballyfin House near Portlaoise, and Castle Oliver in Ardpatrick. Iconic: Filming locations for the HBO series have become tourist attractions . They were spotted going to local cinemas and pubs, and are also reported to have enjoyed a cycling excursion in Ballyhoura Mountains. 'It had a natural indirect effect,' Donohoe said of the Hollywood stars' effect on interest in travel to the country from abroad. 'People looked at Kim and Kanye coming to Ireland and it made them think ""if it’s good enough for them, there must be something worth exploring"".' 'It also encouraged journalists to want to write about Ireland who might not have done so before.' Luxury: The stars stayed in Castle Oliver in Ardpatrick, County Limerick during their honeymoon in Ireland in May . Donohoe explained that the rise in visitor numbers have prompted airlines to increase their services to Ireland too. 'It created a competitive price point for a number of significant airlines to look at more routes into Ireland, and its not just Dublin, but Shannon airport and others as well,' he said. 'This summer we had 6 per cent more seats flying in and out of Ireland compared with last year, and we’ll have 8 per cent more this winter.'","Visitors to Ireland from Britain have increased 11.3 per cent on last year .

"Every dementia patient in the country can expect to suffer poor care at some stage, a damning report warns. It says an astonishing nine in ten care homes and hospitals fail to provide the proper treatment. The Care Quality Commission review found widespread neglect, lack of care, poor training and failings in communication. Poor care: Most of the 400,000 elderly in Britain’s care homes have dementia, as do 40 per cent of those in hospital (picture posed by model) The health watchdog’s report concluded starkly: ‘This unacceptable situation cannot continue.’ Most of the 400,000 elderly in Britain’s care homes have dementia, as do 40 per cent of those in hospital. Despite the huge scale of the problem, thousands of health and care professionals are failing to deal with the issue adequately, the CQC found. Inspectors visited 129 care homes and 20 hospitals across England. They found that 90 per cent had some aspect of poor or inconsistent care. They wrote: ‘It is likely that someone living with dementia will experience poor care at some point while living in a care home or being treated in hospital.’ Many staff fail to carry out basic checks properly, they found, so often they do not pick up their patients’ essential needs. Focusing on improvements: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (above) said there can be 'no excuse, and no hiding place, for poor care within our NHS' Fifty-six per cent of hospitals and 29 per cent of care homes failed to assess fully the needs of those with dementia. Pensioners in parts of the UK may have to spend up to £170,000 on care before they qualify for government help with the bills, a study has found. Last year the Coalition announced a £72,000 cap on care costs from 2016, to stop people being forced to sell their homes to fund it. Once they have paid £72,000, the Government is meant to help with any further costs. But the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries found that when a person’s care spending is calculated – to see whether they have passed the threshold – food, living expenses and extra bills beyond basic care do not count. It means people will pay up to £100,000 more than the Government said, and many will never qualify for help. The average cost will be £140,000, the report said. But a postcode lottery means it will be more in some areas – £170,000 in the West Midlands. A Department of Health spokesman said the cap will protect people from ‘catastrophic care costs’. Patients’ mental, social and emotional health was also neglected, with 42 per cent of hospitals and 34 per cent of care homes failing to deliver consistent care. Inspectors also discovered a major communication breakdown when patients are transferred from a care home to hospital. With many patients unable to tell doctors and nurses their needs, the elderly were in some cases left without pain relief for hours. Some hospitals had lost patients’ health documents or were not aware they had dementia. In other cases, nurses phoned care homes for extra information, only to find the care staff had no knowledge of the patients’ needs or could not access the information. One distraught daughter of an elderly patient told the CQC report, Cracks In The Pathway: ‘The professionals we encountered had very little knowledge on dementia and of my mother’s needs. At times we were made to feel that she was invisible’. Another said: ‘Doctors need reminding that most of the time the person involved has been a pillar of the family.’ Last night Andrea Sutcliffe, England’s chief inspector of adult social care, called for a much more consistent approach to dementia care. She said: ‘People living with dementia, their families and carers have every right to be treated with respect, dignity and compassion. Every dementia patient in the country can expect poor care at some stage, the reports said. Stock image used . Problems: Fifty-six per cent of hospitals and 29 per cent of care homes failed to assess fully the needs of those with dementia (picture posed by models) 'Our review found some great care, delivered by committed, skilled and dedicated staff. But this is not the case everywhere or even within the same service.’ Nearly a million elderly men in the UK are living in isolation and the number is set to soar, a charity warned yesterday. Older men are far less likely than women to have contact with the outside world and many speak to their children less than once a month, a study for Independent Age found. The number of lonely men will rise by more than half to 1.5million by 2030, it said. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘There can be no excuse, and no hiding place, for poor care within our NHS - we are focusing on improving the lives of dementia patients and their families as never before.’ Charities said the report confirmed years of anecdotal evidence. Jeremy Hughes, chief executive at Alzheimer’s Society, said: ‘With a staggering 90 per cent of the care homes and hospitals inspected found to have aspects of variable or poor care, this report highlights the plight that many people with dementia face. Many people are rightly worried about having to move into care.’ Angela Wood, whose 89-year-old mother Ivy suffered terrible abuse at her care home in Pontefract, West Yorkshire, said she was not surprised at the CQC’s findings. ‘It’s been two years since my mum was abused and yet nothing’s changed,’ said Mrs Wood, 59. ‘The whole system is flawed.’ Ros Altmann, former director general of over-50s campaign group Saga, said: ‘We would not treat children in the way we treat older people. 'And the impact is not just on the patients themselves, it is on the families who have to cope with the consequences of an illness that is becoming more prevalent.’","CQC review finds widespread neglect, lack of care and poor training .

Bojan scored one and could have had a second were it not for an offside ruling during Stoke's 3-2 win on Saturday, and Hughes feels his summer signing is repaying  his reported £3million cost. The 24-year-old joined from Barcelona in July on a four-year deal, and nabbed his second Barclays Premier League goal this season as Arsene Wenger's Arsenal left Stoke with nothing. Stoke City manager Mark Hughes has labelled former Barcelona starlet Bojan Krkic an 'exceptional' player . Bojan scored one (pictured celebrating) and could have had a second were it not for an offside ruling . The 24-year-old joined from Barcelona in July on a four-year deal and helped Stoke City beat Arsenal 3-2 . 'It was an outstanding second goal by Bojan, who once again has put in a really impressive performance,' Hughes said. 'I think since he's come back into the side he has played four or five games and I think he has been our man of the match in every game he's played since he's come back. He's playing exceptionally well. 'He's showing everybody that not only is he a good player technically but, in terms of his work rate and what he tries to do for the team, he's very much a team player as well and we're reaping the benefits of that. 'He's integrated very, very well because he's a good personality as well, works hard every day to get better and works hard for the team.' Bojan would have had a brace when his shot from distance crept in but Mame Biram Diouf was flagged for offside, the linesman deeming the striker to be interfering with play. Arsene Wenger's Arsenal left the Britannia  with nothing as Bojan and Co beat the Gunners 3-2 on Saturday . But manager Hughes feels Bojan was denied a perfectly legitimate goal. 'It was a really disappointing decision of the referee to chalk out an outstanding individual goal by Bojan, created by himself,' Hughes continued. 'You really should look to encourage positive play rather than look for a reason to penalise us. 'So we've gone from a situation where we could have been 4-0 up, that puts a spring in their step and very quickly we're looking at 3-2 and we're hanging on when the game should have been dead and buried. 'But we've got ourselves together and for the most part we saw it out quite comfortably.' Stoke manager Hughes felt summer-signing Bojan was denied a perfectly legitimate goal to nab his brace .","Stoke City manager Mark Hughes has hailed summer signing Bojan Krkic .

"Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg has accepted a £5,000 donation from his millionaire investment banker father, triggering speculation that the party’s pool of benefactors is dwindling. According to the latest Register of Members’ Financial Interests, published last week, the money was given to Clegg to support him in his ‘capacity as an MP’. The gift initially caused confusion in Westminster because Clegg’s father is also called Nicholas, prompting jokes that the Deputy Prime Minister had made the donation to himself. Scroll down for video . Family portrait: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg as a boy with his father, also called Nicholas . Nicholas Clegg Snr, 78, made his money through merchant banking and was most recently chairman of the United Trust Bank, of which he remains a non-executive director. He is the son of a Russian-born baroness and was made a CBE in 2009 for services to ‘UK-Japanese relations’. His gift, received on August 8, is the second time he is known to have pledged money to the party. He previously gave £3,000 in December 2008, say Electoral Commission records. Last month, the Deputy Prime Minister was given £5,000 by Muhammad Zahur, described by a party spokesman as a ‘Sheffield businessman’. Figures released last month by the Electoral Commission reveal the relatively fragile state of the Lib Dems’ finances. For the first time ever, Ukip, which has no MPs, raised more money in donations than the Lib Dems during the second quarter of 2014. Nigel Farage’s party accepted £1.4 million of donations – £170,000 more than the Lib Dems. The Coalition party’s income has also been hit by its declining membership, which has fallen by more than 30 per cent since 2010 to about 44,000. The gift, from Nicholas Clegg, initially caused confusion in Westminster, with MPs joking that the Deputy Prime Minister, pictured with his wife Miriam. had made the donation to himself . The Lib Dems’ finances are in stark contrast to those of Clegg Jnr, who comes from one of the wealthiest families of any Westminster MP. He and his wife, Miriam, live in a large property in Putney, South-West London, thought to be worth at least £2 million – meaning that they would be hit by the ‘mansion tax’ proposed by the Lib Dems and Labour. He is paid £134,565 as Deputy Prime Minister and holds an MEP pension, thanks to his five years in Brussels between 1999 and 2004. His wife is a partner at the international law firm Dechert. Her salary is understood to be about £600,000 a year, although she is paid a second salary – thought to be at least £50,000 a year – as an adviser to the Spanish construction firm Acciona. The couple also own a home in his Sheffield Hallam constituency. Aside from the millions he amassed during his lengthy City career, Nicholas Clegg Snr owns a ten-bedroom chateau in Bordeaux, south-west France, which his son often uses for holidays with his family. The Deputy Prime Minister also makes regular use of his family’s £7 million Swiss ski chalet, between Klosters and Davos. A Lib Dem spokesman said: ‘I can confirm Nick Clegg’s father gave him this money. ‘He supports his son in his role as an MP, in his role as Deputy Prime Minister, and in his role as leader of the Liberal Democrats.’","The money was given to Clegg Jnr to support him in his 'capacity as an MP'

"Armed police officers had to be called to calm down furious passengers who confronted British Airways staff during a 10-hour flight delay at Heathrow Airport on Monday. The New York-bound passengers were unhappy with the handling of the situation and demanded to know when their flight to JFK Airport would depart after they were stranded by a mechanical fault on a BA plane. The ugly confrontation occurred after they spent three hours in stifling conditions on a packed Boeing 747 before being allowed to disembark and return to the terminal until a replacement aircraft was ready. Armed police officers were brought in after angry passengers confronted British Airways staff . But some of the passengers became enraged as time passed and surrounded BA staff at a boarding gate desk inside Terminal 5 to find out what was happening. Passenger Brenda Baxter, 59, said: ‘It was very scary. My first thought was that there had been a terrorist attack. ‘It was awful. There was a big crowd up by the desk and people were getting really irate. The next thing, about ten armed police turned up. The Nottingham woman added: ‘Six of them took up positions behind the desk and others stood amongst the seated passengers. It was very intimidating.’ A Metropolitan Police spokesman confirmed that officers were called at 3:30pm to ‘reports of a disturbance’ at Gate 33 in Terminal 5. There were no arrests and officers left the location around 50 minutes later, the spokesman added. Passenger Brenda Baxter, from Nottingham, said the sight of armed police officers was 'intimidating' British Airways said in a statement: 'We apologise to customers for the delay to their flight. Our crew and gate team cared for customers, provided refreshments and as much information as possible, before the flight departed. 'We appreciate that this was a frustrating experience for customers but their safety will always be our highest priority.' A Heathrow Airport spokesperson declined to comment, saying the airport does not comment on security matters. Mrs Baxter, an art festival organiser, was travelling with her 26-year-old daughter Meghan to celebrate her 60th birthday. Tempers flared after passengers spent three hours in stifling conditions on a packed plane . But the dream trip turned into a miserable experience when the mechanical fault was discovered and passengers were held on the plane while engineers attempted to fix the problem. She said: ‘It was awful. We were told there was a fault with the hydraulics and they switched off the air condition. ‘Parents were stripping off little kids because it was so hot. A guy next to us was in a bad way. They were using face wipes to cool him down. ‘It was only after two hours that they gave us refreshments – water and orange juice.’ A police spokesman confirmed that officers were called to ‘reports of a disturbance’ at Gate 33 in Terminal 5 . Passengers were given food vouchers and allowed to return to the terminal, where an hour later and announcement informed them that the plane would be ready to board in a matter of minutes. But passengers were soon informed that the crew could no longer fly because they were ‘out of hours’, adding to the delay. Mrs Baxter said: ‘There was a big cheer when they said we would be boarding in five minutes. An hour later they said it was all off. ‘It was awful. Children were in tears and there was a lot of argument going on.’","New York-bound passengers demanded to know when plane would depart .

"Tiger Woods claims he 'feels fantastic' ahead of his long-awaited return to competitive golf this week. Woods heads into the Hero World Challenge at Isleworth Golf & Country Club in Florida on Thursday, the tournament he annually hosts which benefits his foundation, with a new coach who is in the process of changing his swing. During his four months out of action following surgery on a herniated disc in his back, the 39-year-old turned to Chris Como, who he refers to as a 'consultant', after spending the last four years with Sean Foley. Tiger Woods speaks at a press conference on Tuesday afternoon at Isleworth in Florida . Woods insists he remains 'very good friends' with Foley, but that he needed to do something different. It was another old friend in Notah Begay who recommended Como, with Woods adding at Tuesday's press conference: 'I was very surprised and excited to see how he felt my swing should look like. 'It was very similar to the vision I had, and that's where we're at right now.' Asked for detail on the swing, Woods added with a smile: 'It is new, but it is old. I say that because I haven't done it in a very long time. 'We looked at a lot of video from when I was a junior, amateur, and it was interesting to see how my swing was then and how much force I could generate with a very skinny frame. 'How did I do that? How did I generate that much power? That's what we are getting back into. 'As to how long the changes will take I don't know. I am curious to find that out myself, too.' Woods was last seen in action during a sorry, injury-plagued performance at the US PGA Championship . The swing change is as a result of the injuries that have taken their toll on Woods over the years. But as he noted: 'I'm older. Father Time is undefeated. 'We all eventually start losing some of the things we were able to do when we were younger. 'As an athlete you do notice these things and we all have to make adaptations and adjustments, and I'm no different. 'I'm not quite 40 yet - that's not until next year - so I still have some time.' Woods has not played competitive golf since failing to make the cut at the PGA Championship in August, following which he decided to take some out to get his mind, body and game into better shape. That exit was only Woods' fourth tournament since undergoing back surgery on March 31 to cure a pinched nerve. The 2008 US Open remains the last major of 14 won by Woods with injuries having beset his career since . Woods is adamant his back is now cured and is confident there will be no repetition of the injury which has seen him plummet from world No 1 at the start of the year to No 24. 'It feels great, it feels fantastic,' said Woods, who finished 201st on the money list this year with 'meagre' earnings of just £69,000. 'I've gotten stronger, more explosive, I've gotten faster and now I just need to hit more balls. 'But the body is good. I don't have the sharp pain like I had at the beginning of the year. 'I still have some aches and pains, like anybody else my age and older. 'But I can play with my kids, do whatever I want. I've played a ton of soccer in the backyard. 'Am I game-ready? Probably not quite as I would like to be. I haven't played a tournament round since August' Woods hits a drive during his very first major victory, as a 21-year-old at the Masters in 1997 . Woods achieved notable success and tremendous power despite having a slender frame when younger . Woods, meanwhile, has admitted surprise at the creation of a Ryder Cup task force by the PGA of America following the United States' latest humiliating defeat to Europe earlier this year. As a member of the 11-man panel, Woods said: 'Did I ever think we would end up in this position with a task force? No. 'Our job going forward is we only have this task force once. It's so we have a process in place where everyone is happy with the selection of not only the players, but also the captains, assistant captains. 'If we do our job correctly we're only going to have this once.'","Tiger Woods will make his latest comeback in Isleworth, Florida this week .

"West Ham boss Sam Allardyce faces the sack before the season starts. Football Grapevine can reveal that the owners of the east London club had come to an agreement to give Big Sam ten games into the new season to assess the situation. But after David Sullivan’s criticism of Allardyce, especially with regard to the £15million signing of Andy Carroll last summer, matters have come to a head and caused a massive issue between the dynamic of co-owner David Gold, and assistant Karren Brady. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Allardyce: I find the game strange in terms of manager sackings . Facing the axe: West Ham boss Sam Allardyce's tenure could be over before the new season . Rift: After David Sullivan¿s (left) criticism of Allardyce, matters have come to a head and caused a massive issue between the dynamic of co-owner David Gold (right) and assistant Karren Brady (centre) Football Grapevine has been told that if the club were floundering in October, Allardyce would be sacked and paid off. But issues over the buying of players and complications involving favoured agents have now come into the equation. As revealed in this column nine months ago there is a big issue between the club's owner and Allardyce over the future of Ravel Morrison. Gus Poyet and Slaven Bilic are two potential successors to Allardyce. Bench mark: David Sullivan has admitted the club put all their eggs in one basket when signing Andy Carroll . Difference of opinion: While Allardyce doesn't want to keep him, West Ham want Morrison to stay . Woodward moving to avoid United getting caught out . Manchester United chief executive Ed Woodward is seeking to finalise a series of signings over the next fortnight. Why is Arsene . Wenger moaning about Arsenal’s commercially led pre season schedule? Why didn’t he put his foot down when the arrangements were being made? Given the complexities of top end deals especially after a World Cup he has a long shortlist. But that is not a scattergun approach, just a way of making sure the club don’t get caught out like they were last summer when they devoted most of their time and focus trying to sign Cristiano Ronaldo. When that fell through the club ran out of time to pursue other targets and David Moyes’ ill fated reign was undermined from the outset because of a decaying squad. Mats Hummels of Borussia Dortmund, Real Madrid’s Angel di Maria (who is also wanted by PSG), and Edinson Cavani of PSG are three prime targets. As is Dutchman Kevin Strootman of Roma. Forward fast: Woodward will continue to chase Mats Hummels (top left), Angel di Maria (top right), Kevin Strootman (bottom left) and Edinson Cavani (bottom right) as United's chief seeks to learn from mistakes . Liverpool eye up Vermaelen . Liverpool are set to make another attempt to lure Thomas Vermaelen from Arsenal. But the Belgium international centre-half’s head could be turned by reported interest from Barcelona. Wanted man: Arsenal and Belgium defender Vermaelen is being courted again by Liverpool . Chelsea make move for Brazilian Firmino . Having lured Didier Drogba back to Chelsea to supplement his strike force Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho has said he has completed all transfer business. But the Blues may yet seek to bolster their attacking options by making a move for Brazilian Roberto Firmino. The 22-year-old plays for Hoffenheim and has also attracted the interest of Arsenal. Target: Chelsea may yet seek to bolster their attack by making a move for Roberto Firmino (No 10) I am hearing . Ravel Morrison has had a loan move to CSKA Moscow proposed to him.

Clever buy by Mourinho… then again who recalls what . happened when the Blues took Peter Osgood back... To find out check out . Bobbyfc.com . Libero . It would be naive to read too much into Manchester United’s 7-0 win over LA Galaxy in Louis van Gaal’s first game in charge. But as predicted Van Gaal set out his stall by playing three at the back, a 3-4-3 cum 3-5-2 system. It has been the preferred game plan of the Dutch for years. So it was rather naive for some observers to wax lyrical over some sort of tactical revolution created by Van Gaal. His system has its DNA in the old WM formation which went out of fashion at the end of the Fifites, when wing halves like Bobby Moore dropped back to become second centre halves. Even so playing three at the back, either with three centre halves or two backs  with a sweeper, has come in and out of the English game, often with good effect. Liverpool used it for a period in the Eighties. And of course it worked well for England under Bobby Robson at Italia 90 and France 98 under Glenn Hoddle. The mind of the boss: Van Gaal gave a glimpse of his tactical intentions with United in the 7-0 win over LA Galaxy . Indeed Hoddle used the system when in charge at Chelsea and still thinks it is the way forward for the England national side. But the first team to use to system in the modern era was Notts County who under manager Jimmy Sirrell and influential coach a certain Howard Wilkinson played in the top flight in the early Eighties. One of the key players of the three man back line was a player called Pedro Richards. A South American? No he was born in Edmonton, north London. Those who argue English defenders can’t adapt to play three at the back talk tosh. Indeed Van Gaal might even turn Phil Jones and Chris Smalling into international class players. System: Hoddle used the 3-5-2 system when in charge at Chelsea and still thinks it is the way forward for England . Back Heel . Many argued after he announced his international retirement that Steven Gerrard didn’t have many great games in the 114 times he played for England. That’s a bit harsh but it’s true he was never the constant force of nature for country that he has been for so long for Liverpool. One stand out display though springs to mind in the early days of his England career was his role in England’s 5-1 over Germany in Munich in 2001. There were plenty of fine performances by England players that night and Gerrard was brilliant. Perversely though there is strong argument that that result saw England slide into a comfort zone under Sven Goran Eriksson and the Germans realise they needed to revolutionise the structure of their national game. Highlight: One of Steven Gerrard's finest hours in an England shirt was in the 5-1 win over Germany in 2001 .","Sam Allardyce may be out the door before the season gets underway .

"When Samsung unveiled its Galaxy Note Edge in September, the South Korean firm said it would be available 'in the fall', but no exact date wasn't given. The latest filings from the Federal Communications Commission, however, now suggest the handset is imminent. The FCC has officially tested and approved the sale of the curved phablet on certain LTE, also known as 4G, frequencies, and this is typically one of the final steps before a wide release. Scroll down for video . When Samsung unveiled its Galaxy Note Edge, the firm said it would be available 'in the fall', but an exact date wasn't given. Filings from the Federal Communications Commission (pictured) have now approved the phone to go on sale in the US, suggesting the handset is imminent . The files were originally spotted by the GforGames blog. It said the handset is likely to be available to T-Mobile and AT&T customers in the US first, because the files lists frequency bands used by the two network operators. Prices for the device are yet to be announced. Samsung surprised audiences at the Berlin-based trade show IFA in September when it unveiled its curved device. Processor: 2.7 GHz Quad-Core . Display: 5.6 inches (141.9mm) Quad HD+ Suiper AMOLED (2560 x 1440) Operating System: Android 4.4 (KitKat) Rear camera: 16 MP Auto Focus camera . Front camera: 3.7MP . Memory: 32/64 GB internal and microSD slot (up to 64 GB) RAM: 3GB . Dimensions: 5.9 inches x 3.2 inches x 0.3 inches (151.3 x 82.4 x 8.3 mm) Weight: 174g . The screen was described by Samsung's David Park at the event as working like a 'ticker', with notifications and news scrolling along it. The Galaxy Note Edge's unique curved touchscreen provides quick access to frequently used apps and alerts. The curved screen displays notifications at the top and bottom, while viewing a video without disruption, for example. Because the curved edge remains visible even if a flip-book style protective cover is used, it is easier to keep up-to-date with incoming calls and messages. The Note Edge was announced alongside the new Galaxy Note 4 phone, which lacks the side screen, and a virtual-reality headset called Gear VR. The Galaxy Note 4 is available in the US and the UK on pay-monthly contracts starting from $30 in the US and £45 in the UK. The latest version of the large smartphone has an improved interface, including a new Multiwindow feature that enables users to minimise and resize different screens on their phone for multi-tasking in much the same way you would on a desktop computer. The Edge uses Samsung's flexible-display technology, which came out to much fanfare last year, but has seen little use beyond a phone and a fitness device with displays that were slightly curved. With the Edge, Samsung is offering a practical use for the curvature. While the main screen remains flat like previous phones, the right edge extends and curves until it reaches the back. The files also suggest the phone is likely to be available to T-Mobile and AT&T customers in the US first, because it lists frequency bands used by the two network operators. South Korean-based Samsung unveiled the curved 'phablet' in September to the surprise of many in the audience . The Samsung Galaxy Note Edge features a 16MP rear-facing camera (left) and a 3.7MP front camera (right). The tech giant also announced the Galaxy Note 4 and the Gear VR headset developed in tandem with Facebook-owned virtual reality company Oculus . That creates a side display so information such as weather and time can be seen from the side when the phone is laid on a table or nightstand. With the side display, the phone's camera functions more like a stand-alone, point-and-shoot camera, as the shutter button and other functions appear on top when the phone is held horizontally. The side display of the Edge also provides one-tap access to various apps normally found on the home screen. It will also have a panel of tools, like the flashlight and stopwatch, akin to what Apple offers in the iPhone's Control Center with a swipe up from the bottom. Samsung will look to app developers to find new ways to use the feature. The Galaxy Note 4 is available in the US and the UK on pay-monthly contracts starting from $30 in the US and £45 in the UK.

"A porn star who wants to create a national day for 'self pleasure' is standing as a candidate in the Toronto mayoral race - just days after the city's controversial mayor checked himself into rehab. X-rated starlet Nikki Benz announced she wanted to stand for mayor, amid news that Rob Ford had taken a break from his election campaign to treat his substance abuse. The Toronto-born entertainer, who has been promoting her campaign on Twitter, has already released an election campaign video, which has had more than 35,000 views on YouTube. Scroll down for video . Nikki Benz has announced she will stand in the 2014 Toronto mayoral race - just days after mayor Rob Ford took a break from his campaign to check into rehab . In the video, she tells viewers she has 'high concerns' about the city's management and says Torontonians need someone 'who understands and exudes transparency'. She then tells viewers: 'You can . search my positions — but only if you're over 18.' Benz, who is backed by her porn company employers Brazzers, has not yet filed her official nomination but has vowed to do so on May 28  - National Masturbation Day. But she has already used the cheeky video to tell would-be voters about her policies, including her idea to turn Toronto’s light rail into a 'Brazzers Pleasure Rail,' complete with vibrating seats for women and sex toys for men. She says she would also start a National Masturbation Month, which would include a day's national holiday to celebrate 'self pleasure'. Benz, who is from Toronto, says Torontonians need someone 'who understands and exudes transparency' Porn star Nikki Benz has released an election video after announcing she was 'very serious' about standing as a candidate in the Toronto mayoral campaign . Referring to Ford's admission that he has taken drugs, she says: 'Orgasms make for happy, . healthy people, unlike other vices - not to take a crack at anyone . here.' Benz vows to give the city's light railway a 'makeover' with vibrating seats for women and sex toys for men . The actress, who has starred in films such as 'Pump Fiction', also tells viewers that she is in favour of Pride - something which stands her apart from Ford. She says she wants the world to know Toronto is 'an open-minded city promoting equality'. Benz's announcement is the latest twist in an election campaign which has been filled with drama. Just last week, Mr Ford went to rehab at an undisclosed location for at least 30 days - the day after reports emerged of a second video which appeared to show him puffing from a crack pipe. His decision to seek treatment came months after he announced he was finished with alcohol — only for more reports of drunken behaviour to emerge. The scandal over Ford's crack use started last May when a first video showed him smoking the drug. After police said they had obtained that video, Ford admitted that he had used crack in a 'drunken stupor'. Ford - who has not been charged with any crime - has not abandoned his bid to seek a second term in the October 27 election. But observers say the revelation of a second video could ruin his chances of success. Ford, who said he was '100 per cent committed to getting myself right', was elected four years ago on a wave of support from Toronto's suburbs. Mayor Rob Ford, speaking during an election debate in March, says he is '100 per cent' committed to making himself right . He honed in on conservative voters with promises to slash spending, keep taxes low and end what he called 'the war on the car'. But his tenure has been overshadowed by controversy, making him a national embarrassment for many voters. Ford has refused to resign, despite mounting pressure after a string of incidents - from public drunkenness . to an appearance in another video that showed him threatening 'murder' in an incoherent rant. Toronto's city council has stripped him of most . of his powers. Deputy Mayor Norm Kelly is now in charge . of the city, but he had already assumed most of the powers that were . stripped of Ford last year. In a statement last week, before leaving the city for rehab, Ford said: 'I have a problem with alcohol, and the choices I have made while under the influence. 'I have tried to deal with these issues by myself over the past year. I know that I need professional help and I am now 100 per cent committed to getting myself right.'","Porn star Nikki Benz has vowed to stand as a Toronto mayoral candidate .

This will give them a username and password, as well as a code sent to their mobile phone, which will give them access to government services. Driving licences and some self-assessment tax returns will be among the first services to be offered as part of the scheme next month, with tax credits and benefits records expected to follow in March. But last night there were concerns about the scheme because of the history of hugely costly government IT projects and data blunders. Emma Carr, director of Big Brother Watch, which has been involved in the scheme’s development, said the ‘government must tread carefully’ given past issues over losing records. She told The Times: ‘It has to ensure that this is a scheme that the public can have full confidence in. ‘They must make themselves very clear about how it will work, including details of what safeguards are in place to ensure that the private companies being used to verify a users’ identity won’t wrongly gain access to any information.’ Experian will be one of the government's private sector partners in the new identity scheme: Under the programme, users will choose one of five private providers to complete an online security check . Government aides insisted that rather than bringing in ID cards by a different method the scheme would make any attempt to reintroduce a compulsory document less likely. ‘This removes once and for all the need for an identity card because it will be possible to prove your identity securely without one,’ a source told The Times. Labour introduced the controversial idea of ID cards in 2002, but they did not become a reality until November 2009 after years of disagreements. The Coalition government scrapped the entire project less than a year later, saying it wanted to reverse what it saw as ‘an erosion of civil liberties’ under Labour.","Government forced to deny scheme is basically ID cards by the back door .

"It's not just luxury sailing vessels that are being exhibited at this year's Monaco Yacht Show. Instead, a wide variety of high-tech water gadgets are now being offered to the crowds of discerning millionaires attending the prestigious event. If the wealthy customers ever get bored of sunning themselves on the decks of their mammoth gin palaces, they can splash out personal submarines, jetpacks, even a 'walking' boat. The £110,000 Jetlev-Flyer - a water-powered 'jetpack' that can hover up to 30 metres in the air . Life of the super-rich: The  Monaco Yacht Show 2014 is the largest in the event’s history .

Designed by Canadian engineer Raymond Li over ten years, the device costs £110,000. The contraption is connected to a 10-metre hose which sucks up water before it is spat out through two nozzles. The machine can be used for up to three hours at a time, while the engine also doubles as a flotation device. It is one of dozens of high-end accessories being sold by Superyacht Toys & Tenders, who have a stall at this year's event. The Jetlev-Flyer is connected to a 10m hose which sucks up water before it is spat out through two nozzles . Like mini cruise ships: Organisers at the Monaco Yacht Show are expecting more buyers from emerging markets such as Turkey, China or South Asia this year . Around 200 of the water-based jetpacks have been sold across the world, with the company's managing director Josh Richardson explaining: 'Generally people are getting more adventurous with their luxury toys.'

It is able to do barrel rolls underwater, dive straight down, or make sharp turns. It was created by British inventor Graham Hawkes who also developed the machine used in the film starring Roger Moore. The DeepFlight Super Falcon - a submersible similar to the one used in the 1981 James Bond film For Your Eyes Only. The machine costs £1m and can reach depths of 400ft . The DeepFlight SuperFalcon was created by British inventor Graham Hawkes for Hawkes Ocean Technologies, who also developed the machine used in 007 film For Your Eyes Only, starring Roger Moore . The submarine, which has been described as the 'Lear Jet of the seas, has a carbon fibre hull that encompasses two cockpits with dual flight controls. It can also remain underwater for 24 hours. 'Just as private individuals are now able to explore space, we see our submarines as opening up the oceans for private exploration,' said Karen Hawkes, who founded the DeepFlight company with engineer husband Graham in 1996. 'Except unlike spacecraft, these owners get to the pilot their own vessels.' The Triton deep sea mini-submarine is another underwater device proving popular with the super-rich. The three-metre-long, two-man craft has been specifically designed for mega-yachts and comes with a hefty $2m (£1.2m) pricetag. The Triton deep sea mini-submarine is another underwater device proving popular with the super-rich . The greatest show on water: The annual show in Monaco celebrates the world’s most luxurious superyachts . It is powered by four thrusters and has a top speed of 2.5 knots when submerged. There is enough air on board for a 12-hour trip and it can dive to a depth of 1,000ft. The 3.3ton high-density acrylic bubble gives a 360-degree view of the deep, while the luxurious cockpit has air-con and leather-lined seats. 'It gives clients the opportunity to see a part of our planet that no human has ever visited before,' said Marc Depp, the company's sales and marketing manager. 'Many of our clients are also concerned about their legacy and the condition of the oceans, and make their submarines available to marine scientists.' The company currently build between four and six submarines a year. The Iguana yacht is another contraption that the wealthy elite might be tempted to shell out for. It's an amphibious boat-car with retractable caterpillar tracks that enables it to be driven in and out of the water. The Iguana yacht is an amphibious boat-car that can be driven in and out of the water . The Iguana can reach a brisk 35 knots at sea thanks to its big 300hp engine, and costs £190,000 . Designed by Frenchmen Tanguy le Bihan and Antoine Fritsch Associés, the Iguana can reach a brisk 35 knots at sea thanks to its big 300hp engine. On land it can only move at 5mph because it relies on a smaller engine out of the water. It has room for 10 people on board and features a teak floor, table and sundeck. The craft costs a cool £190,000. 'All of our customers bought the yacht because they have a legitimate use for it, such as entering or exiting a waterfront property,' said the company's sales manager Steve Huppert. 'We haven't had people buying it simply to show off.' The Monaco Boat show is one of the most upmarket boat shows in the world and has a strict entry policy for the exhibiting companies. The Monaco Boat Show show was launched 24 years ago and attracts an average of 33,000 people each year . Up to 500 companies in the luxury yachting world are able to showcase the latest high-tech nautical products and luxury yachting services, while 105 spectacular super and megayachts are exhibited every year. The show, which was launched 24 years ago, attracts an average attendance of 33,000 people. The show's managing director Gaëlle Tallarida said: 'Fifteen years ago a person who owned a superyacht was usually 50 years old. Now we're seeing people who are 30 years old owning one. 'These toys attract them because they have a special way of enjoying yachts, compared to their parents who perhaps had to wait until they were older to buy one. 'They like sports and really enjoy being in the sea -- not just sailing and lying on the sundeck.'","This year's Monaco Yacht Show features a string of high-tech water toys .

"The youngest daughter of the crazed Florida father who shot and killed two of his three children last week only survived because her older sister acted as a human shield. Lauren Mohney, nine, is currently in a stable condition only because her sister, Savanna Mohney, 14, put herself in the way of her father, David Mohney's bullets during his shooting spree at the family home in Port Orange. When officers responded to the home they found the girls mother, Cynthia Mohney, 48, curled up between her two daughters and the estranged couple's son, David dead in his bed. Scroll down for video . Happy family: A look at Cynthia Mohney (far right) with her three children Lauren, Savanna and David, who were all shot by their father David Mohney . Still stable: Savanna, 14, (left) saved her little sister, Lauren (right) from their father and the nine-year-old is currently at a local hospital and in a medically induced coma . Court filings showed David Mohney wanted to leave his wife and move with daughter Savanna (pictured) and her siblings to South Dakota . 'We believe Savanna was coming down the stairs because she suspected something bad had happened (to her brother),' said state attorney Zachary Stoumbos to the Journal Online. 'But then changed her mind and went to her younger sister's bedroom to protect her.' Stoumbus said he belives Savanna's selfless actions saved her younger sister from their crazed father, who locked his wife out of the house after telling her he was going to kill their children because she wanted a divorce. 'Savanna was draped over Lauren,' said Stoumbos. 'We believe that because she protected her little sister, Lauren's injuries were not as bad.' The nine-year-old is currently in a coma at the Arnold Palmer Hospital in Orlando. Her mother has not left her side. According to Cynthia Mohney's lawyer, David Mohney told her on the morning of the murders, 'If you don't come back to me and stop the divorce, I will kill our children.' The retired Army sergeant then reportedly punched her in the mouth at their Port Orange, Florida, home, and added, 'If you’re going to take my kids away, you will not have them and you will go through the rest of your life without children.' Killer and a coward: David (above) killed himself after killing his children . Zachary Stoumbos, the attorney for grieving mother Cynthia, says her husband woke her up early that morning saying that something was wrong with their son, before taking her to the kitchen and showing that he had a gun. 'He continued to tell her, ""You will be back with me,"" and, ""This divorce was going to stop,""' Stoumbos told WFTV. Then, when Cynthia ran to get help, she heard shots fired while at a neighbor's home. She immediately ran back to the house and was found lying between her two daughter when authorities arrived. 'His hate took over his love for his children,' added Stoumbos. 'I can't imagine that level of evil, that level of hate.' David had claimed his wife Cynthia was a violent, abusive alcoholic in court papers filed just two months before he gunned down his children Friday in their quiet, middle-class neighborhood just south of Daytona Beach. The girls: Cynthia, with daughter Savanna and Lauren, has not left the side of her only surviving child, Lauren, since the incident occurred . Smiling girls: The two sisters, Lauren and Savanna and their brother, David, before their father decided to try and kill them . However, neighbors said both parents were troubled. In a 911 call before the shooting, a neighbor told a dispatcher that neither parent should have had children because they were 'a little bit selfish and self-centered' and said 'you can't believe either one of them.' He had recently finished chiropractic school while she supported the family working as a physician's assistant, making $220,000. Nearly a month after he filed for divorce, the husband sought a protective injunction against his wife June 3. He said in court papers his wife had been drinking heavily and slapping him and their children on their chests, backs and arms. Florida's child welfare agency said Cynthia had recently been treated for substance abuse. The slain children were 11-year-old David Mohney and 14-year-old Savanna Mohney, Volusia County Sheriff Ben Johnson said. Nine-year-old Lauren Mohney was also was shot and in stable condition at a hospital. Cynthia  wasn't injured. 'If he wants to commit suicide, let him commit suicide. To shoot the children, that's cowardly,' Johnson said at a news conference outside the family's home. Deputies received a call at 5:11am Friday. Arriving deputies found the two girls in an upstairs bedroom and the boy in a bedroom on the first floor. Their father was in the kitchen with a handgun next to him. Survivor: The wife was at the house of a neighbor trying to get help in their Port Orange, Florida, neighborhood when the shooting occurred while the children were asleep at the home . In court papers, David Mohney said he and his children 'prefer living in a climate with snow to celebrate Christmas and other holidays.' Pictured: victim Savanna Mohney, 14 . Little guy: Young David was pronounced dead on the scene . In his divorce filing, David said his family moved to Florida in 2010 so he could study at Palmer College of Chiropractic's campus in Port Orange. He graduated in September 2013, but failed his first time taking the board exam and hoped to try again soon. He said in the court papers that returning to Rapid City, South Dakota, had been his family's plan all along, but his wife had become opposed to it. He said his children also wanted to make the 1,900-mile move to get relief from their allergies and because they found the Midwest region better suited their 'morals and values.' David Mohney said he and his children also 'prefer living in a climate with snow to celebrate Christmas and other holidays.' When he filed for divorce, David Mohney said little about problems with his wife. He made more specific accusations when he asked a Volusia County court for a protective injunction June 3. In that filing, David Mohney cited four instances between April 4 and May 29 in which he said his wife had slapped one or more of their children. He said his wife would hit the children — sometimes several times — for arguing with each other, talking back to her, or for not picking up their toys and clothes when she told them to. 'The ""hits"" described in the examples are loud and hard, beyond corporal punishment,' David Mohney wrote. 'My children were crying, afraid and trying to duck or get away from Cynthia.' However, he dismissed the request for protection two weeks after filing it. The state's child abuse hotline was notified in June that Cynthia Mohney had a substance abuse problem after an incident at a restaurant. Cynthia Mohney followed through on treatment, according to the Department of Children and Families.","David Mohney shot his three children and then killed himself on Friday .
