"By . Louise Boyle . A Romanian couple wanted by Interpol for an alleged $68million tax evasion built a network of sealed bunkers under their rural Washington home where they could have hid out for months. Radu Nemes, 39, and his wife Diana, 38, built a network of bunkers and passages and filled them with stockpiles of gold coins and food at their home, set on 53 acres in Yelm. The fascinating details emerged in recently-unsealed FBI documents on the alleged Romanian fraudsters. The couple were arrested in March and are facing extradition to Romania after being accused of working with corrupt politicians in their home country on the massive tax dodge. The bunker could be sealed from the inside on the rural Yelm property and was stockpiled with goods . The elaborate bunker built by a pair of fugitive Romanian tax cheats under their home in rural Yelm, Washington . Radu Nemes, 39, and his wife Diana, 38, are facing extradition to Romania to face charges that they dodged millions in fuel taxes. They were caught hiding out in Washington state where they had joined a spiritual group . The couple had accrued a number of . properties, including a $3million log cabin, and number of businesses in . Washington which are believed to have been paid for with laundered . money. Millions were also spent on gold and silver coins, construction equipment and at least on yacht. Mr Nemes and his wife Diana, who is 38 and pregnant with her third child, poured thousands of dollars into building the elaborate bunker. The couple have two other sons, aged eight and nine. The shelter could be sealed from the inside and had food, water, a working kitchen and practical supplies to live for months. A stash of four pistols and two rifles including an AR-15-style assault rifle were found at the home. According to court papers seen by Seattle PI, investigators searching the property with radar equipment discovered a 'fully equipped and furnished underground bunker'. 'That bunker could comfortably have housed the entire family for months if not years, given the supply of food found in storage in that structure,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Norman Barbosa said in court papers. The FBI also reported that the Nemes had been traveling the U.S. on first-class flights. They spent more than $200,000 at designer boutiques and blew hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash. The couple allegedly moved their 70-ft yacht â€“ the Ramaya â€“ from the Mediterranean in late 2012. It was sold months later for $2.3million. Newly-released FBI photos reveal an elaborate bunker that a pair of fugitive Romanian tax cheats secretly built. Inside was stockpiles of water and food . The bunker, which was stacked with chemicals and food supplies, was discovered by the FBI last month using radar equipment . The Nemes, who arrived in the U.S. in 2012 after reportedly fleeing their native Romania following charges of tax evasion, settled in the quiet town, far out west. It is then that they became members of the Ramtha School of Enlightenment (RSE). The . RSE was established by female leader J.Z. Knight, a business school . drop-out from Roswell, New Mexico, who claims to channel messages from a . 35,000-year-old warrior. Her spiritual method claims to bring . together ancient wisdom with the power of consciousness and the latest . scientific discoveries. Ms Knight, (the J.Z. stands for Judy Zebra), . a 68-year-old who has three marriages under her belt, holds retreats . for her followers on private land attached to her French chateau-style . mansion. In 2007, her business filed profits of $2.6million from retreats, books, CDs and DVD sales. The bunker could be sealed from the inside and could support the couple for months on the rural land . The FBI came across a fully-stocked bunker complete with functioning kitchen on land owned by two Romanian fugitives in Washington . The industrial bunker could have housed a family for months, if not years, the FBI said this week . A . former business partner of the Nemes, Doug McCrea, told MailOnline last . month that despite being evidently very wealth, the couple were quiet . and unassuming. He . said occasionally the couple came for a glass of wine at his bar but . kept to themselves. He described Mrs Nemes as a 'petite blonde' who came . across as a very nice person. Court documents show that the Nemes also bought a home in Thurston . County, and were allegedly in the process of building a lavish property on the grounds with the . illegal funds, according to investigators. They also owned a a . restaurant and a large commercial property in Yelm. A promotional poster from J.Z. Knight who founded the Ramtha School of Enlightenment in 1988 in Yelm, Washington . The Ramtha method uses ancient wisdom and scientific developments, according to its followers . According to filings, Radu Nemes . allegedly worked as part of a criminal gang to illegally import 1million . tons of diesel fuel and sell it in Romania through shell companies . between 2011 and 2012. The shell companies were set up in names of homeless people to distance the Nemes from the fraud. The massive tax dodge came by importing the fuel for manufacturing purposes then selling it directly to consumers. Diana Nemes allegedly helped her . husband by laundering money from the fuel scheme through Dubai accounts . and then bringing it into the U.S. A . spokesman for the Ramtha school issued a statement to MailOnline in . March saying the school 'has no information about allegations from the . Romanian government or the student referenced'. A Romanian couple accused in a plot to dodge $73 million in oil taxes in Romania were arrested this week while living in Yelm in rural Washington state . Ramtha's School of Enlightenment, which claims roots in the teachings of a 35,000-year-old warrior from a mystical land, was founded 26 years ago by a business school drop-out from Roswell, New Mexico. JZ Knight (born Judith Darlene Hampton in 1946) is the spiritual school's 'high priestess' after she claims that she was visited in 1977 by an entity named Ramtha, an ancient warrior who channels his teachings through her. Followers participating in an event at Ramtha's School of Enlightenment . Ramtha, the 'Enlightened One', marries ancient wisdom with neuroscience and quantum physics to allow followers to access their own 'direct channel' with God. Between 1979 and 1988, Knight traveled the U.S. having private 'dialogues' with students. In 1988, Ramtha's School of Enlightenment was founded on former ranch land in Yelm, a small city in rural Washington state. It is . an 'academy of the mind that offers retreats and workshops to people of . all ages and cultures', according to its official website . By 1995, Ramtha's school had an international reputation. J.Z. Knight was touring Australia, Italy, Japan and South Africa to spread her message of how students can use their brain power to 'Become a Remarkable Life'. The school has a 80-acre fenced compound, not open to the public, which is the site of retreats for students and staff. The 68-year-old religious guru's company, JZK Inc. posted profits of $2.6million in 2007 from these courses along with books, tapes and DVDs. In 2008, Ramtha's School of Enlightenment spread to 20 more countries including the Czech Republic, Romania and Chile.

High-end taste: Police say Matthaus used her boyfriend's card to make thousands of dollars worth of purchases at Bergdorf Goodman, and also bought airline tickets . Police say the model swiped an American Express credit card from her boyfriend, top financial adviser Michael Hadjedj, which she then used without his consent to buy clothes and accessories at Bergdorf Goodman on Fifth Avenue, according to New York Daily News. The New York Post reported that she also charged plane tickets to the card to fly to Europe for a rendezvous with another man. Matthaus was apprehended just before 8pm Wednesday after returning from her trip. Ms Matthaus is a former spouse of German soccer manager and former player Lothar Matthaus, 53, who is best known for leading West Germany to victory in the 1990 World Cup.

Called it quits: After only two years of marriage, the couple separated in 2010 amid rumors of infidelity . The Ukrainian beauty, born Kristina Chudinova, met the thrice-divorced 47-year-old Matthaus at a beer hall during Oktobefest in 2007, and the couple got married the following year in Las Vegas. The husband and wife separated in 2010 amid rumors of infidelity on Ms Matthaus' part. The 5-foot-10 brunette reportedly sued her ex-husband later that year in a bid to to compel him to pay 3,000 euros for a breast reduction surgery. Her most recent  boyfriend, Hadjedj, is the co-founder and CEO of the Manhattan-based financial management firm United First Partners. Matthaus was released on her own recognizance Thursday evening. She is due back in court August 12. Jilted lover: Matthaus' attorney insists the larceny charge is her boyfriend's way of getting back at her for breaking up with him . If convicted of a third-degree grand larceny charge, she could face up to seven years in prison. The suspect’s attorney, Mark Jay Heller, insisted that his client had permission to use Hadjedj's credit card, and that he pressed charges against her as payback for breaking up with him after a nine-month relationship. ‘She is considered a treasure by German society and has conducted her life in an exemplary fashion,' said Heller, who also has represented Lindsay Lohan and her mother.","Kristina Liliana Matthaus, 26, charged with third-degree grand larceny for allegedly stealing financier Michael Hadjedj's American Express .

"By . Julian Robinson . An Italian pensioner aged 75 has been accused of being 'sex mad' - by his wife who is 50 years younger than him.

"By . Associated Press . Hillary Rodham Clinton's upcoming book will be called ""Hard Choices,"" a title that reflects how the potential 2016 presidential candidate may try to define her record as President Barack Obama's secretary of state while she considers another White House campaign. Publisher Simon & Schuster said Friday the new book, to be released June 10, will offer Clinton's 'inside account of the crises, choices and challenges' she faced as secretary of state and 'how those experiences drive her view of the future.' 'All of us face hard choices in our lives,' Clinton writes at the start of the book, according to the publisher. 'Life is about making these choices, and how we handle them shapes the people we become.' Scroll down for video . Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced the title of her upcoming memoir on Friday. In Hard Choices is expected to cast a more positive light on her time in Obama's administration . Clinton's State Department memoir will hit bookshelves as the former first lady and New York senator sits atop polls about hypothetical candidates as the leading Democratic contender should she seek the presidency. Since leaving the State Department, Clinton has traveled widely, giving speeches to industry groups, college students and others while joining the foundation led by her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, and her husband, former President Bill Clinton. 'The hard questions are not, ""Do you want . to be president?"" ""Can you win?"" The hard questions are, ""Why? Why . would you want to do this?"" and ""What? What could you offer that could . make a difference?"" ' Clinton said during a recent speech. Clinton's potential candidacy has been eagerly anticipated by Democrats, who frequently ask Clinton about her intentions and encourage her to try to become the nation's first female president. A series of Democratic outside groups are already building support for a future campaign, and Republicans are actively critiquing her record. Republicans have criticized Clinton's response to the killing of four Americans in the 2012 attacks on a diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, and questioned her handling of relations with Russia. In 2009, Clinton memorably gave Russia's top diplomat a red button labeled, ""reset,"" to symbolize how U.S. relations had thawed, but the button was mistranslated into Russian. In the aftermath of Russia's bold annexation of Ukraine's strategic Crimean peninsula, Republicans have suggested it represented a naivetÃ©. Simon & Schuster said on a website promoting the book that Clinton and Obama ""had to decide how to repair fractured alliances, wind down two wars, and address a global financial crisis. They faced a rising competitor in China, growing threats from Iran and North Korea, and revolutions across the Middle East."" 'Along the way, they grappled with some of the toughest dilemmas of US foreign policy, especially the decision to send Americans into harm's way, from Afghanistan to Libya to the hunt for Osama bin Laden,' the publisher said. The book will chronicle Clinton's travel to 112 countries and nearly 1 million miles as secretary of state and 'offers her views on what it will take for the United States to compete and thrive in an interdependent world. She makes a passionate case for human rights and the full participation in society of women, youth and LGBT people.' Clinton will also 'offer readers a master class in international relations, as does her analysis of how we can best use ""smart power"" to deliver security and prosperity in a rapidly changing world â€” one in which America remains the indispensable nation.' Clinton is already a publishing powerhouse: Her 2003 memoir, Living History, sold more than a million copies, and her new book's release is expected to include a publicity tour with stops around the country. The new book is expected to play an important role in shaping her legacy and setting up a White House bid if she chooses to run.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Prosecutors in New Jersey on Thursday announced that no charges would be filed against a group of high school wrestlers who took a photo of several members of the team lynching a practice dummy that is wearing the t-shirt of a rival high school wrestling team. A photo of the students on the Phillipsburg High School wrestling team 'lynching' a practice dummy wearing a Paulsboro High School wrestling team t-shirt achieved viral Internet status in February. Both schools are powerhouses in New Jersey high school wrestling, and reportedly are each others' top rival. Classless: In a photo that went viral in February, Wrestlers from a New Jersey high school simulate a lynching as two teens don Ku Klux Klan-esque hoods . In its decision to not bring charges against any of the students involved in the insensitive image, the Warren County Prosecutor's Office came to the conclusion that there was nothing criminal about the photo. 'Based upon the evidence obtained and the concurrence of the Attorney . General's Office after reviewing the investigative file, no criminal . charges will be filed at this time,' Richard Burke, the county . prosecutor, said in a statement. The prosecutor's statement went on to say that he was turning the case back over to school administrators for 'whatever administrative action, if any, they deem appropriate.' Mea culpa: The students behind the photo have apologized through an attorney and claim the photo wasn't premeditated . Lynching is often associated with racism towards African Americans in the southern United States. Between 1882 and 1968, there are 3,500 known cases of African Americans getting lynched. That's compared to about 1,500 non-African Americans lynched in that same time period. In the photo taken by the Phillipsburg wrestling team, the dummy is black - and several of the students have the hoods on their sweatshirts fashioned into a point, similar to a traditional ceremonial outfit of the Ku Klux Klan. Each of the students in the photo have apologized through an attorney. They say the pose wasn't premeditated, according to philly.com. Powerhouse: The dummy was wearing Paulsboro High School t-shirt, which is Phillipsburg's top rival in New Jersey high school wrestling . The students involved in the photo already have been removed from New Jersey's Interscholastic Athletic Association. It's unclear if the school will take further actions against the students.","The students dressed the lynched practice dummy in the t-shirt of their rival high school .

"By . Chris Pleasance . An Indianapolis police officer has broken into his ex-wife's home and shot her dead before turning the gun on himself, police say. Sergent Ryan Anders broke down the back door of ex Kim Carmack's home at around 5.40pm on Indianapolis' west side, before neighbours reported hearing gunshots. SWAT teams arrived at the scene to find the bodies inside the house, according to Indianapolis police chief Rick Hite. Police Chief Richard Hite says Ryan Anders shot ex-wife Kim Carmack after breaking into her home in Indianapolis. Carmack took out a restraining order again Anders after the couple separated .

Eight million people have signed up for health care through new government controlled insurance exchanges, President Barack Obama announced Thursday. Obama held a last-minute press conference in the White House briefing room to celebrate the new Obamacare figures, which beat initial projections by 1 million people. 'This thing is working,' Obama said of the Affordable Care Act. President Barack Obama announced Thursday that eight million people signed up for health insurance under the country's government-run healthcare insurances. Under the new law, Americans who do not receive health insurance through their employer are required to purchase it out-of-pocket . Obama and Democrats have been anxiously awaiting the age figures, especially those regarding young people — the most coveted demographic. Younger enrollees tend to be a healthier group overall, so their premiums can help offset higher cost of care for older enrollees. Too few young people in the mix, and healthcare premiums could surge. Obama announced Thursday that about 35 percent of those who signed up for the exchanges are under the age of 35. The new figures gave the President an opportunity to rag on Republicans, some of whom have accused the White House of 'cooking the books' by announcing large overall enrollment numbers before releasing more detailed figures that provide a fuller picture. 'They still can't bring themselves to admit that the Affordable Care Act is working,' Obama said during Thursday's presser before attacking Republicans' 'endless, fruitless repeal efforts' and claiming that the Obamacare 'repeal debate is, and should be over.' 'It’s long past time for Washington Democrats to work with us to remedy the mess they created—and that means repealing this law and replacing it with real reforms that actually lower costs,' Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, fired back after Obama's speech. 'The President may want to silence any further debate about Obamacare, but in doing so he betrays a lack of confidence in his own policies and scant regard for those most affected by the law.' The President spent nearly as much time . during his remarks criticizing Republicans' opposition to his signature . law as he did touting its success, meanwhile arguing that Republicans' time would be better spent passing legislation that would positively . affect Americans' lives. Polling shows the law remains . unpopular in much of the country, but Democrats plan to use the high . enrollment figures to argue that by trying to repeal the law, . Republicans are actively working to take health care away from millions . of Americans who now rely on the exchanges. Other critical details for evaluating . how well the law is working remain unknown. Officials haven't released a . tally of how many enrollees were previously uninsured — the key to . determining how many people gained coverage that they otherwise wouldn't . have. Another unknown is how many enrollees sealed the deal by paying . their first month's premium to the insurance companies. Gallup . estimates that slightly more than half of those getting coverage . through the federal and state markets were previously uninsured, drawing . that conclusion from the polling company's large survey tracking the . health care overhaul. In a statement sent to reporters after Obama's remarks, Speaker of the House John Boehner's office once again accused the White House continuing 'to obscure the full impact of Obamacare.' 'Beyond refusing to disclose the number of people who’ve actually enrolled by paying premiums, the president ignores the havoc that this law has wreaked on private plans that people already had and liked. Surveys have consistently shown that the overwhelming majority of those who signed up already had insurance,' Boehner's press secretary Brendan Buck said in an email. 'Had this law not led to millions of Americans receiving cancelation notices, many would not have had to sign up for this government-run program.' President Barack Obama (center) sits between Vice President Joe Biden (left) and outgoing Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius (right) during a meeting with health insurance executives on Thursday. Seven months out from Election Day, Democrats are seeking to turn the page on the law's flawed debut ¿ a strategy underscored Sebelius' departure . Following the disastrous rollout of the . exchanges in October, when HealthCare.gov was virtually unusable, . Democrats have been hoping that higher-than-expected results could help . their candidates reclaim the political high ground ahead of the midterm . elections. Seven months out from Election Day, Democrats are seeking to turn the page on the law's flawed debut — a strategy underscored last week when Obama announced that Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who became the face of the rollout failure, was stepping down. Today's press conference reiterated the White House's hopes that the country would 'move on' from the Obamacare debate before November, even if the Republican Party does not.","Today's numbers exceeded projections by 1 million people.
During his remarks today, the President took a victory lap and called on Republicans to stop their 'endless, fruitless repeal efforts.'
Republicans responded in kind, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who said Democrats need to 'remedy the mess they created.'"
"By . David Mccormack . A new interactive map of the United States shows that a staggering 47 percent of the country remains unoccupied. The map is the work of Tumbler blogger Mapsbynik who created it using information from the 2010 census. The U.S. Census Bureau breaks the nation down into blocks for tabulating statistics. As of the 2010 census, the United States consists of 11.1 million census blocks. A new interactive map of the United States shows that a staggering 47 percent of the country remains unoccupied - the green represents the blocks where no one lives . The blocks are not all the same size, as the bureau creates boundaries based on factors such as major borders, rivers and streets. More than 4.8 million of the blocks totaling 4.61 million square kilometers were reported to have no population living inside them, according to the research. A single inhabitant is enough to make a block inhabited. So despite having a population of more than 310 million people, 47 percent of the country remains unoccupied, writes blogger Nik. Although most of the zero-population zones - depicted in green - are uninhabitable due to being natural habitats such as rivers and forests, other inhabitable blocks include large factories, airports and office buildings. Just because a block is unoccupied, that doesn’t mean it is undeveloped. Alaska and Hawaii are both states that feature large areas that are uninhabitable due to geography such as mountains . The map shows a significant difference between the eastern and western halves of the country. While unpopulated places are more likely to stand out in the east of the map, it is the population centers which stand out more against the wilderness areas of the west of the country. Mapsbynik has created an interactive map that allows users to zoom into any area of the US. ‘At the local level, city and county parks emerge in contrast to their developed urban and suburban surroundings,’ Nik wrote in his blog. ‘At this scale, even major roads such as highways and interstates stretch like ribbons across the landscape.’ ‘Ultimately, I made this map to show a different side of the United States. Human geographers spend so much time thinking about where people are. I thought I might bring some new insight  by showing where they are not, adding contrast and context to the typical displays of the country’s population geography.’ If densely populated cities such as New York, left, aren't your thing, perhaps you should look to move to Alaska, right, where the population is considerably less .","Map created by blogger Mapsbynik using information from 2010 census, which breaks the nation down into blocks .

Ruth Alvarez walked free in tears yesterday from Lower Buckeye Jail in Pheonix, Arizona, to be greeted by family members including her 18-year-old daughter. The Mexican national was first arrested in September over claims she used another person's identity to gain work. The case was dropped but prosecutors relaunched it and detained her on April 1. Scroll down for video . Tears: Ruth Alvarez hugs her daughter Indira Alvarado after being released from jail just a week before surgery . Arrest: Illegal immigrant Alvarez, right, was detained on April 1 for using another person's identity to gain work .

She wept as she told Fox News while trapped in jail: 'It's so hard going to treatments, seeing how your body, your whole life changes. Freedom: Alvarez emerges from the Arizona jail . 'I know I was wrong but at the time I only used it to get a job. 'If they want to come back and get me that's fine. I just want to be out there with my family on those days.' Alvarez agreed a plea bargain with the Maricopa County Attorney on Wednesday which saw her admit a misdemeanor. She will serve a year of unsupervised probation. The cancer has spread to nearby lymph . nodes but has not invaded distant organs, meaning the surgery could give . her a fighting chance. Alvarez had already received . chemotherapy before her arrest and the tumor had shrunk significantly, and they are . hopeful about the mastectomy. She will return home before entering hospital to prepare for the surgery next week. Alvarez, . who had been living in the country illegally, wept again as she hugged . her 18-year-old daughter Indira Alvarado outside the jail surrounded by . several supporters. 'I'm very happy and very thankful,' she said. I never expected this much support...I prayed for this moment.' She . praised county attorney Bill Montgomery, saying: 'I feel he's a very . good person.

Waiting game: The cancer is at stage three meaning it has spread to nearby lymph nodes but has not invaded distant organs, meaning the surgery next week to remove breast tissue could give her a fighting chance . Alvarez's daughter, who has a four-year-old brother, said she could not cope with watching her mother trying to struggle through in hail. She said: 'It was heartbreaking to see her battling a potentially terminal illness behind bars without proper care or proper hygiene' Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said they had agreed to not detain her or pursue criminal action for the moment. If they do pursue a case in future, she could be eligible to remain under a law for those who have lived in the U.S. more than 10 years and whose removal would cause 'exceptional hardship' for their families.","Ruth Alvarez, from Mexico, was arrested for using fake ID to obtain work .

"By . Lydia Warren . A seven-year-old boy has been electrocuted while swimming in his family's pool, apparently due to a faulty light beneath the water. Calder Sloan was racing his nanny's adult son across the backyard pool in Miami, Florida on Sunday when the man felt a shock in the water, leaped out and yelled for the boy to get out too. But Calder, who was underwater and couldn't hear him, suddenly received a massive jolt that threw him out of the water. Neighbors rushed to the home and performed CPR on the boy before paramedics arrived. Scroll down for video . Loss: Calder Sloan, 7, has died after he was electrocuted while swimming in his family's pool on Sunday . Neighbor Fabian Pesantes, who was giving him CPR, told News10: 'As I was touching the water, to wipe off my mouth, I was getting zapped. As I was performing CPR on the boy I was getting zapped.' The boy's parents, who were visiting friends, received a call and Calder's father, Christopher Sloan, said he heard his wife scream, 'Is Calder dead?' as she ran outside. The couple raced to Jackson North . Medical Center, but their son had already passed. While authorities say he was killed by a low voltage, an investigation is still underway into exactly what caused the death. As his father stood in the backyard and paid tribute to his oldest son as he spoke to the Miami Herald, the rusty light fixture could be seen in the half-drained pool. Heartbroken: Chris Sloan paid tribute to his 'heaven-sent' son as he stood in front of the family's pool . Scene: It appears that he was shocked through a rusty light fixture at the back of the pool . Sloan said that about nine months ago, he noticed that the pool light was broken so they hired a contractor to fix it. Among the family's grief and the chaos of organizing the funeral, they have not yet tracked down the name of the contractor. Calder's dip into the pool on Sunday was the first time anyone had been in in months. North Miami requires permits and . inspections on pool electrical work, city spokeswoman Pam Solomon said, but city building . department records don't indicate any permits at the Sloan home. Electricians told family members earlier this week that the light switch to the . pool wasn't grounded properly, so power that should have . been diverted from the pool was instead going directly into it. 'Somebody did not do their job,' Chris Sloan said. Beautiful family: Calder smiles alongside his parents Chris and Carla and younger brother Caleb . Remembered: Calder, a sports lover and energetic young boy, was called 'Mr Awesome' by his family . The family is now struggling to come to terms with the loss of the son they called 'Mr Awesome' while their youngest son, Caleb, tries to understand what has happened to his best friend. 'He was heaven-sent,' Chris Sloan told the Miami Herald as he stood by the pool. 'Any success in the world you've accumulated - financial, . professional - anything you've accumulated means nothing when you lose a child, especially one who was such a gift to this world. 'I'm numb. It's very hard to cry anymore. He was simply what . he was. He was Mr. Awesome.' He remembered his son as a sports fan who loved basketball, soccer, fishing and kayaking. Just last week, he had celebrated his seventh birthday at a community soccer field. Happier times: Just last week, the family celebrated Calder's 7th birthday at a community soccer center . 'He was boundless with joy and energy,' his father said. 'A Calder kiss would be the greatest day of your life. He . was so sweet and untainted.

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . A baby gorilla born less than a month ago at the Milwaukee County Zoo has unexpectedly died, the zoo said Thursday. The western lowland gorilla, named Kassiu, which is pronounced CASH'-yoo, was born March 19 to 13-year-old mother Naku and 27-year-old father Cassius. Zookeepers reported the baby girl and mother appeared normal Wednesday morning. But by the afternoon, Kassiu appeared weak and stopped holding onto her mother, as newborn gorillas do, the zoo said in a statement. Gone too soon: Tiny Kassiu died suddenly Wednesday and veterinarians have not yet discovered the cause of death . Cherished new arrival: In this photo taken March 26, 2014 at the Milwaukee County Zoo, Kassiu is held by her mother Naku Milwaukee . The zoo's medical staff examined the baby and gave her fluids, glucose and antibiotics. A neonatologist and pediatrician were also called in, but Kassiu died Wednesday evening. The University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Veterinary Medicine was expected to perform a complete necropsy, or animal autopsy. Preliminary results were expected within a few days but a complete report might take several months, depending on the cause of death. The last gorilla birth at the zoo was in 1992. Grieving mother: Kassiu's mother Naku knows her daughter has died, say zoo workers . First-time mother: Naku and Cassius were both experiencing parenthood for the first time with Kassiu . Kassiu was the first offspring for both her mother and father. Rafert said Naku is being consoled by the baby's father. 'She knows,' Rafert told CBS 58. 'You don't have a baby and lose it and not know.' Staff at the zoo are heartbroken by the loss of the tiny primate. 'The . worst is not knowing. Is it something we could have done?' Jan W. Rafert, the zoo's curator of primates and small mammals told JS Online. Unexpected death: Up until Wednesday, Kassiu appeared to be in perfect health, and Naku was a capable mother, say zoo staff . 'The first week was the most critical and we got through that. Everything's looking good and then all of sudden, out of the blue, this happens.' Western lowland gorillas are critically endangered in the wild, but are more common than their relatives, the mountain gorillas. Western lowland gorillas live in heavy rain forests, and it's difficult for scientists to accurately estimate how many survive in Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria, Gabon, Angola, and possibly the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to the zoo.","A one-month-old female gorilla has died at Milwaukee County Zoo .

"By . Becky Barrow . Stamp duty is distorting Britain’s housing market by pushing up property prices and urgently needs to be reformed, experts said yesterday. The warning came as estate agents painted a bleak picture of a housing market that is being crippled by the lack of homes available to buy. The average agency has just 42 homes to sell – down by a quarter since September and the smallest number for ten years. Stamp duty, which is paid by the purchaser, is so cripplingly expensive for homebuyers that many decide to extend their current home, rather than sell up and move. The resulting lack of homes on the market is pushing up prices. Stamp duty is distorting Britain¿s housing market by pushing up property prices and urgently needs to be reformed, experts said yesterday . The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), the leading economic forecaster, said stamp duty is ‘a strong contender for the UK’s worst-designed tax’, and described the way it is charged as ‘perverse’. Dominic Raab, a leading Tory MP, said it ‘warps the market’ and described it as a ‘vindictive stealth tax on the middle classes’. He added that the ‘cliff edge’ nature of its thresholds was ‘particularly absurd’. Until 1997, stamp duty was charged at just one per cent on all homes sold for £60,000 or more. Now it is charged at one per cent on properties between £125,000 and £250,000, three per cent up to £500,000, rising to a maximum of seven per cent on homes of more than £2million. Many families decide it is cheaper to extend their current home than buy a new home because they want to avoid a hefty stamp duty bill. As a result, the average home owner now moves once every 22 years, compared to once every eight in the 1980s, according to research by property firm Hometrack. A Council of Mortgage Lenders spokesman said: ‘Some stamp duty liabilities now look sufficiently large to discourage some people from buying and selling, regardless of whether their accommodation needs are growing or contracting. The average agency has just 42 homes to sell - down by a quarter since September. File picture . ‘As a result, the UK may suffer the effects of an increasingly inefficient use of the existing stock. Larger dwellings will be disproportionately in the hands of the elderly – under-occupied and perhaps not maintained as well as they should be.’ Homebuyers will pay a record-breaking £10.1billion in stamp duty during this tax year, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility, the Government’s independent forecaster. Between 2013/14 and 2018/19, it expects the total amount of residential stamp duty to be an eye-watering £70.4billion. Yesterday the National Association of Estate Agents said a record proportion of buyers are being forced to pay above the asking price because there are so few homes with a ‘For Sale’ sign. ‘As supply continues to drop, many more buyers are willing to pay more than the asking price to secure their dream property,’ it said. At the peak of the housing market in 2008, there was an average of 100 properties for sale in each estate agency branch. It is now less than half that. A Treasury spokesman said stamp duty was ‘an important source of Government revenue, raising several billion pounds each year to help pay for the essential services the government provides and supports’. She added that there were no plans to reform the system. A separate report, from the banking giant Halifax, predicts that Britain will become ‘a nation of renters’ within a generation as young people are frozen out of the property market by soaring house prices. The report said people ‘are now beginning to accept a lifetime of renting’. When asked about the future of homeownership in Britain, the Halifax poll found that nearly half – 48 per cent – believe Britain will become a nation of renters within a generation. Craig McKinlay, mortgages director at Halifax, said: ‘We may be heading towards the point where the aspiration to own a nice home will be replaced by the aspiration simply to live in one. It seems that people are now beginning to accept a lifetime of renting.’ The Halifax report – based on a poll of more than 8,000 people – reveals that more than 60 per cent of first-time buyers between the age of 20 and 45 who bought in the past four years needed help from their parents.","Average agency has just 42 homes to sell, lowest number for 10 years .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Thursday that a family of dissident ranchers and their supporters in his home state of Nevada are 'domestic terrorists,' citing this week's standoff with the federal government's Bureau of Land Management. Cliven Bundy has refused to pay grazing fees for land where his hundreds of cattle roam every day. The land is owned by the federal government, which says he owes more than $1 million. Bundy, however, insists that since his family has been using the land since the 1870s, Uncle Sam can't collect the grazing fees. A tense standoff developed this week after armed BLM officers and other federal agents seized more than 400 head of cattle after a judge declared that Bundy was trespassing. Harry Reid called a group of dissident Nevada ranchers and their supporters 'domestic terrorists' after their standoff with the federal government over cattle-grazing fees . Old West, part II: Protesters on horseback pressured the feredal Bureau of Land Management to return seized cattle that belong to rancher Cliven Bundy . Mass of humanity: Cliven Bundy's supporters rallied near the Virgin River on April 12 . Officers tasered protesters on a road near the ranch after they left a government-designated 'free speech zone.' As Bundy's resolve stiffened, more than 100 armed self-styled 'militia' members gathered to defend him. After more than a day of hair-trigger tension, the government backed down. Most of the cattle are being returned. Speaking at a Las Vegas Review-Journal event on Thursday, Reid dropped a rhetorical sledgehammer. 'These people, who hold themselves out to be patriots are not. They’re nothing more than domestic terrorists,' he said. 'I repeat: What happened there was domestic terrorism.' 'There were hundreds – hundreds of people from around the country – that came there,' Reid said. 'They had sniper rifles on the freeway. They had assault weapons. They had automatic weapons.' Reid claimed that some protesters said they had 'children and women lined up because if anyone got hurt we wanted to make sure they got hurt first, because we want the federal government hurting women and children. ... What if others tried the same thing?' He also said he had spoken with Attorney General Eric Holder, FBI Director James Comey, Interior Secretary Sally Jewell and Clark County, Nevada Sheriff Douglas Gillespie about the situation. The Bundy matter is 'not over,' Reid declared. 'It is an issue that we cannot let go [or] just walk away from.' Rancher Cliven Bundy has become a rallying point for anti-government activists who object to Washington, D.C.'s intrusion into the Western United States' cowboy culture . Reid said he doesn't intend to back down permanently, and is forming a federal government task force to evict Bundy and his cattle from the contested land . The government declared the land hear Bunkerville, Nevada off-limits in 1993, citing a need to protect an endangered desert tortoise. But some studies indicate that cattle-grazing improves the species' habitat and increases its chances of survival. Bundy's claim that his ancestors' use of the contested land gives him a special right to graze cattle there without paying the government that owns it may run into an insurmountable obstacle. Nevada's 1864 Constitution, which was ratified before his family started using the land, cedes authority over public lands to Washington. 'The people inhabiting said territory do agree and declare, that they forever disclaim all right and title to the unappropriated public lands lying within said territory,' it reads. ' and that the same shall be and remain at the sole and entire disposition of the United States.'","Senate Democratic Majority Leader plans a full-court press against rancher Cliven Bundy over his refusal to pay grazing fees on federal land .

"By . Bill Craven . and Charlotte Thompson . Fighting for life: Preston Flores suffered 8% burns after being set on fire in Aberdeen . A seven-year-old boy was last night fighting for his life in hospital after being turned into a human fireball. Preston Flores ran into the street ‘on fire’ near his home in Aberdeen after his clothes became doused in petrol and ignited. The youngster, who is thought to have suffered 80 per cent burns, may have been deliberately set on fire – or been the victim of a prank gone wrong. Last night, he remained in a ‘serious’ condition in hospital, with his mother Luisza at his bedside. When asked if police were conducting a criminal inquiry, Detective Inspector Lorna Ferguson said: ‘It’s too early to say at the moment.’ However, Police Scotland later confirmed that officers at the scene in Bedford Avenue were following ‘a positive line of inquiry’. Eyewitnesses told how they watched in horror as the boy, screaming in agony, suddenly appeared with flames licking all around one side of his body. One described the shocking scene as Preston was on fire from the neck downwards, his clothes sticking to him  as he lay terrified on the ground. Another said someone handed the youngster a bucket of water, which he immediately poured over himself in a  desperate attempt to put out the fire. Victoria Pirie, 17, last night told how she heard screams as the boy ran into the back garden of his block of flats, yelling and crying. She said: ‘It was just horrid. He was on fire from the neck downwards, his clothes were sticking to him. They weren’t really big but they were enough to do a lot of damage to him.’ Earlier, the schoolboy had been outside enjoying the fine weather, playing with two friends, a boy and a girl, in the street near his home. The tragedy happened shortly before 2pm yesterday afternoon. Local resident Paulina Pilska said she had been watching the children from her window as they jumped on top of a council pick-up van. The 25-year-old cleaner said: ‘They were searching for something. I saw one of them with a container, like a watering can.’ A seven-year-old boy is being treated for serious burns after reports that he was 'on fire' in a residential street . The schoolboy is believed to have been seriously hurt in the incident in Bedford Avenue, Aberdeen . Minutes later, Preston was running around  outside the block of flats with flames shooting from his clothes. Miss . Pilska said the other children were trying to put him on the ground but . he was shouting, although not very loudly at that stage. She added: ‘I was shocked.’ Emergency . services were called to the scene and although firefighters arrived . within three minutes, Preston is understood to have suffered serious . injuries, with 80 per cent burns to his body. Shortly . afterwards, his mother, who had just returned to their flat from the . shops, learned of the accident after neighbours began banging on her . door. Residents said the mother-of-five collapsed on the ground when she . saw her son. Paramedics gave her oxygen and she was taken away in the ambulance with young Preston. Police . cordoned off two streets as they carried out detailed investigations to . establish the exact circumstances surrounding the tragedy. As . stunned neighbours huddled together, some in tears, they watched police . officers scour a grassy lane between two blocks of flats. Resident Shona Henderson, 16, said: ‘I saw clothes lying all over the ground and his shoes and the fire still there. Emergency crews were called to the scene shortly before 2pm and he was taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for treatment . Shocked local resident Paulina Pilska said she watched the boy running from the side of a building with flames all over one side of his body . ‘By the time we got there, his clothes were sticking to his skin, it looked like they had melted into his skin. It was horrible. ‘There . were lots of people around him. Someone handed him a bucket of water . and he poured it all over himself. He was screaming.’ Preston . was taken by an ambulance under police escort to the Royal Aberdeen . Children’s Hospital, where medical staff carried out emergency surgery. Last night, it was believed he had been flown to a specialist burns unit at an Edinburgh hospital for further care. Police last night confirmed that their investigations were continuing. Residents said the boy is believed to have had fuel on his clothes which somehow ignited . DI . Ferguson said: ‘We are appealing for witnesses in relation to the . incident and inquiries are at an early stage at the minute until we . establish exactly what happened.

"By . Associated Press . An ex-con who spent most of his adult life behind bars on Thursday got what he said he wanted for robbing a suburban Chicago bank. The 74-year-old gets to go back to the place he called home — prison. Telling Walter Unbehaun he frightened a teller by showing her a revolver tucked in his waistband during the 2013 heist, a federal judge imposed a 3 1/2 year prison sentence, citing a rap sheet that includes crimes from home invasion to kidnapping. 'This is not the first time you've inspired fear,' Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman said, scolding the high-school dropout and part-time bathtub repairman. Life on the inside: 73-year-old Walter Unbehaun, an ex-convict from South Carolina seen during a bank robbery in Niles, Illinois.. Unbehaun told investigators he intended to get caught so he could live his final years behind bars . As he had on the day he robbed the bank, Unbehaun gripped a cane as he hobbled to a podium to make a brief statement. He didn't withdraw his wish to go to prison, though he said, 'I don't want to die in prison.' 'My crime is bad, there ain't no doubt,' he said calmly. 'I just wanna be like everybody else.' Boredom and loneliness, defense filings said, had partly led Unbehaun to conclude that a life on the inside was preferable to life outside. No family or friends of Unbehaun attended Thursday's hearing in Chicago. Listening to the proceedings, he fidgeted and rubbed his forearms, both of which sported tattoos. He occasionally nodded as his lawyer spoke. Last year, he walked into the bank with a cane but no disguise, displayed the loaded gun and told the teller, 'I don't want to hurt you.' With $4,178 in loot, he drove to a nearby motel and waited for police to arrive. When they did, the bald, portly . Unbehaun dropped his cane, raised his hands and startled police by his . apparent joy at getting nabbed. At his initial court appearance, he also confounded his lawyer. 'His first words were, 'I just want to go home,' that same attorney, Richard McLeese, told the court Thursday. Robbery: Investigators say Unbehaun walked out of the Harris Bank in Niles with $4,178 in his pockets . For a few minutes, McLeese had thought Unbehaun was saying he hoped to get bond. Then he realized Unbehaun was asking to go to prison. It was as if, McLeese said, a patient had asked his doctor to help him have a stroke. 'It is, without a doubt, one of the saddest and most disturbing cases I've dealt with,' he said. Prosecutor Sharon Fairley conceded the judge faced a dilemma: Sending Unbehaun to prison could be seen as more reward than punishment to him, but setting him free would risk him committing another serious crime. His case raised broader societal questions, she said in one filing. 'Did the system fail Mr. Unbehaun? Or was his inability to stay out of jail the result of his own free will?"" she asked. ""We may never know. But what we do know, clearly, is Mr. Unbehaun lacks the desire to lead a law-abiding life outside of prison walls.' Hold up: In 50 years, he has spent just six out from behind bars. His case highlights a wider societal dilemma about what to do with an increasingly elderly ex-cons, many of whom spent so much of their lives inside prison that they, like Unbehaun, can't cope with life on the outside . The Chicago-born Unbehaun first went to prison at 23 for transporting a stolen car. He was convicted of kidnapping a 19-year-old girl in 1970 whom he had tied to an Ohio motel bed before fleeing in her car. His record includes more than half a dozen convictions, including — ironically — for escaping from prison. He pleaded guilty in September to the 2013 bank robbery. Prosecutors asked for a five-year sentence Thursday, though they'd asked for seven in earlier filings; the defense asked for three. It wasn't as if no one tried to extend Unbehaun a helping hand. Following his 2011 release from prison after serving an 11-year term for bank robbery, his sister and her husband bought Unbehaun, a childless widower, a trailer home in rural Rock Hill, S.C., the couple said Wednesday. He spent his days watching television, or drawing and painting. 'He was living like a hermit,' McLeese said. 'The analogy he drew was that it was like living in solitary confinement.' Time on his hands: Walter Unbehaun created a drawing. It was sent to the federal judge in his bank robbery case while awaiting sentencing . McLeese told the court Thursday the onset of mild dementia may have contributed to Unbehaun's decision to rob his way back into prison. He said the last judge who sentenced him failed to ensure his mental health treatment. Coleman said Unbehaun would also serve three years of closely monitored probation and that mental health services should be readily available to him. She had some kind words for Unbehaun. She praised his skill as an artist, citing drawings he'd sent her. And she sounded sympathetic when she talked about Unbehaun going into a prison environment that will be harsher for him now that he's pushing 80. As the hearing ended, Unbehaun requested that he be sent to FCI Greenville prison in southern Illinois, walking Judge Coleman through the various benefits of the facility, including good work programs. Coleman agreed to recommend that prison. She then shook her head. 'It's sad,' she said, 'to have a defendant who knows the facilities and knows which ones to go to.'","Chicago criminal gets his wish: more prison time .

"By . Associated Press . A Florida man suffocated his young, crying son so he could play video games on his Xbox and watch TV, sheriff's deputies said Friday. Cody Wygant, 24, is charged with third-degree murder and child neglect. He was being held Friday without bail at the Citrus County Jail. Sixteen-month-old Daymeon Wygant wasn't breathing when emergency crews arrived at the home Thursday morning. The child pronounced dead at a hospital, investigators said. Killer: 24-year-old Cody Wygant from Florida confessed to killing his crying infant Thursday morning so he could continue playing Xbox games, according to police . 'It is inconceivable that a father could kill his infant son — it just baffles the mind,' Sheriff Jeff Dawsy said. 'Our only sense of relief now comes from knowing that we did exactly what we needed to do to bring justice to him swiftly. Our prayers go out to those who knew and loved Daymeon.' Wygant said he was frustrated because the boy was crying uncontrollably, preventing him from playing his Xbox games, according to investigators. He covered the boy's nose and mouth for three to four minutes until he became lethargic, then placed him in a playpen and covered him with bedding, which was tucked around the boy's body and head, officials said. Arrested: Cody Wygant was arrested on Thursday on third-degree murder charges and willful child neglect over the death of his infant son, Daymeon . Wygant didn't check on Daymeon for five hours, investigators said, while he played Xbox and watched three episodes of the television show 'Fringe.' By the time he checked on the child, Daymeon had turned blue and was unresponsive, they said. Wygant is the primary care giver for the child, and the mother — Wygant's girlfriend — was not home, officials said. During preliminary interviews with the parents, they indicated the child had been placed in the playpen around 7 a.m. Thursday, officials said. But upon further questioning, Wygant said he suffocated the child around 1 a.m., they indicated. More important things to do: Wygant wanted to play on his X-Box and watch episodes of Fringe . The medical examiner performed an autopsy, but results haven't been made public. Sheriff's officials said Wygant moved to Florida in 2013 and has no family in the area except for his girlfriend. Her name was not released. They have a 3-month-old daughter, who is in the custody of the Department of Children and Families.","Cody Eugene Wygant, 24,is charged with third-degree murder and willful child neglect .

"By . Ap . and Daily Mail Reporter . Former NFL quarterback Donovan McNabb was released Thursday from an Arizona jail after serving a one-day sentence for a DUI arrest late last year. Records released by West Mesa Justice Court show McNabb served his time Wednesday and was released about 1:30 a.m. Thursday. McNabb, 37, was arrested Dec. 15 in the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community east of Phoenix, according to court records. Busted: McNabb was arrested on December 15 while doing 81 MPH in a 65 zone . Star: McNabb played 13 years in the NFL after being drafted with the second overall pick in 1999 . A copy of the citation shows McNabb was stopped on the Loop 101 freeway just after 3 a.m. and radar clocked his Range Rover at 81 mph in a 65-mph zone. He also was cited for DUI, but no information about blood-alcohol level was on the citation. McNabb pleaded guilty on March 27 and nine days of his sentence was suspended. Court documents show McNabb was ordered to pay a nearly $1,500 fine and enter an outpatient treatment program in Scottsdale from April 10 to July 8. The Maricopa County Sheriff's Office released McNabb's mug shot Thursday morning, starting a media frenzy about his arrest, which hadn't been previously reported. Infamous: Sheriff Joe Arpaio runs the jail where McNabb was held and has a history of placing his friends and celebrities in a facility known as 'The Mesa Hilton' Tent City: Many DUI convicts in Arizona serve time in Arpaio's 'Tent City' but it's unclear if McNabb was placed in the outdoor jail . The agency later said in a statement that McNabb was booked into a detention facility on Wednesday by order of the West Mesa Justice Court and released after serving one day for a misdemeanor DUI charge. McNabb's Phoenix-based attorney Stephen Benedetto didn't immediately return a call Thursday seeking comment on the case. The former quarterback joins a long list of professional athletes who have been convicted of DUI in the Phoenix valley - and who've spent time in the jails run by Maricopa County's infamous Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who has gained notoriety by implementing modern-day chain gangs and making jail inmates sleep in outdoor tents. It's unclear whether McNabb served his time in the 'Tent City' jail complex - where the majority of DUI offenders are placed -- or at one of the county's other facilities, like the cushy complex in suburban Mesa that is often referred to as the 'Mesa Hilton' because it is where Arpaio often places celebrities, friends and political allies who find themselves on the wrong side of the law. Other notable athletes busted for DUI in Arizona include former NBA star Charles Barkley, former baseball star Mark Grace and boxing legend Mike Tyson. McNabb played 13 years in the NFL after being drafted with the second overall pick in 1999. McNabb joins a long list of athletes who have been convicted of DUI in Maricopa County, including boxing legend Mike Tyson and NBA star Charles Barkley . He led the Philadelphia Eagles to four straight NFC championship games from 2001 to 2004 and one Super Bowl berth that ended in a 24-21 loss to the New England Patriots in 2005. McNabb played for the Washington Redskins in 2010 and Minnesota Vikings in 2011 before retiring. He currently co-hosts a sports talk radio show and has a home in the Phoenix area.","McNabb was arrested in a Phoenix suburb on December 15 .

"By . Andrew Levy . A woman who faked death to avoid prosecution for a £39 fraud has been handed a suspended sentence. Victoria Sully, 32, pretended to be her own mother and made a series of emotional calls to court staff to make them think she was seriously ill. Then, in a final call, they were told that she had passed away. The mother of two was only caught years later when she was arrested following a domestic incident involving her partner. Victoria Sully faked her own death to avoid appearing in court over a £39 fraud, after she paid for a tanning session on a stolen credit card . When police checked her details, one officer asked her: ‘Aren’t you supposed to be dead?’ She has now been handed a six-month suspended sentence after admitting fraud by false representation and attempting to pervert the course of justice. Yesterday Sully said she wanted to put the whole matter behind her, adding: ‘It was a long time ago and it’s all been dealt with.’ She also claimed that she hadn’t made the phone call reporting her death. Speaking at her detached three-bedroom house near Ashford in Kent, she insisted: ‘I didn’t make the call to say I was dead. ‘It was another girl. I found out a week and a half later but it was too late to do anything by then.’ Sully was arrested for using a stolen credit card to pay for a tanning session at a salon in October 2008. She was due to appear before magistrates the following June but failed to attend. Court officials began to receive calls from a woman claiming to be her mother. In the first call, it was claimed she had suffered a miscarriage. Sully was spared a prison term. Judge David Goodin sitting at Ipswich Crown Court (pictured) handed the mother-of-two a six month suspended sentence, ordered her to do 200 hours of unpaid work . A few days later another stated she . had undergone a hysterectomy and was having chemotherapy for . cancer. Prosecutor Michael Crimp said this was supported by a hospital . letter. He told . Ipswich Crown Court that Sully had received a genuine letter following a . smear test which mentioned ‘borderline’ cell changes. By . the time the part-time supermarket worker had finished tampering with . it, it suggested she was receiving urgent hospital treatment. The final call in which her death was announced led staff to end proceedings on February 25, 2010. Her file was marked ‘defendant deceased’. Sully evaded detection until New Year’s Eve 2012 when police were called to her home following a report of a dispute with her partner. Judge David Goodin also sentenced Sully to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work. He said she must provide a medical certificate if she couldn’t make any of the sessions – and warned her not to  hand in forged documents. Oliver Kirk, defending, told the court: ‘She had to die or face up to it. You could say the offence has come back to haunt her from her own grave.’","Victoria Sully was arrested in October 2008 after using a stolen credit card to pay for a £39 tanning session at a salon in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk .

"By . Jenny Wood . Thinking of a spot of spring cleaning this weekend? Always dreamed of  a cleaning method that will kill 99 per cent of germs without the use of a single chemical? And one which will require minimal elbow grease, and be suitable for ­everything from floors and carpets to windows, sofas, taps, tiles — even defrosting your freezer? If so, steam cleaning is for you. All of a sudden it’s got the country hot and bothered, with John Lewis reporting sales of steam cleaning devices rocketing by 94 per cent over the last year. Sales of steam cleaners at John Lewis have increased by 94 per cent in the past year . Whereas cloths and sprays often remove dirt only from surfaces, high-pressure steam can penetrate deeper into nooks and crannies, blasting away stubborn particles and killing everything from bacteria to mould, with nothing more than tap water. It doesn’t leave chemicals behind, binds with dust to stop it escaping into the air and, most importantly, decimates dust mites. Most even claim to clean Chesterfield sofas. It all sounds too good to be true, so is there a catch? Critics complain it can take up to six minutes for the water to become steam and many steamers have a high ‘faff factor’, with complicated buttons, scant instructions and lots of bewildering attachments. Then there’s the fact that you still need to wipe up afterwards to remove dislodged dirt and excess water. So, is this the new golden age of steam, or just a load of hot air? JENNY WOOD put eight of the best-selling models to the test . . . Jenny Wood tries out the latest models of steam cleaners to hit the market . FUN, FAST AND FURIOUSHoover SteamJet Handheld Steam Cleaner, £59.99, hoover.co.uk . This ‘seriously powerful’ handheld steamer weighs just over 1lb. It claims to have one of the fastest heat-up times going and a tool for every conceivable job.Jenny says: Wielding this in my bathroom like some kind of sci-fi stun gun was fun. The sensible curved design protected my hand from the steam, which is controlled by a slider switch on the handle. It’s fairly idiot-proof — for most tasks just waft the steamer over the area you want to clean. It’s quick to fill, and took just under 20 seconds to start steaming. The long cord also made moving around the room easy. Perfect for nooks and crannies, it made my loo shine, had a good bash at the limescale around the taps (no steamer removed it completely) and the brush attachment made my grouting look like new. The downsides? It fared less well with a greasy oven top and, on the maximum setting, it produces a LOT of excess water.  VERDICT: Great for tricky little jobs, particularly in the bathroom.4/5 . Jenny tries out one of the cleaning models in the bathroom . BEST ALL-ROUNDERThane H20 X5 Steam Cleaner, £79.99, Thane.tvNamed Product of the Year, this ‘stylish’ steam mop converts to a handheld model in seconds and comes in red, green or white.Jenny says: Don’t be alarmed by the number of pieces when you open the box — the clear instructions include advice on which attachment to use for different tasks, from cleaning grouting to steaming clothes. It’s lightweight and simple to use, heating up in 15 seconds. The tank is easy to fill, and there’s just one on/off switch and a dial to control the amount of steam produced. It removed plenty of dirt from my kitchen floor, and the handle and mop head detached with one click to turn it into a handheld steamer. It got rid of scum from grouting with minimum effort, and left my windows streak-free thanks to a handy cloth that attaches to the squeegee. My favourite of those I tried.VERDICT: Easy to use, quick to heat up and tackles a range of jobs. 5/5 . Whereas cloths and sprays often remove dirt only from surfaces, high-pressure steam can penetrate deeper into nooks and crannies . QUICK AND COMPACTPolti Vaporettino Lux Steam Gun, £34.95, John LewisReady in minutes, this compact handheld is designed for surfaces that need regular refreshing and claims to reach the trickiest spots.Jenny says: Unlike some steamers, you don’t have to worry about where to put this down if the phone rings. A sensible kettle-like shape, it sits happily on your work surface. Just as well, really, as it took nearly three minutes to get up to steam. Once full of water, it’s fairly heavy and the cord is shorter than most. The lid to the tank was robust but difficult to unscrew; I had to wait over an hour — I assume until it had cooled — to be able to open it and empty the water afterwards. The steamer comes with lots of tools, but minimal instructions; still, it’s useful for little jobs such as sterilising children’s toys, and the spatula attachment was the best I tested at removing grease from my hob. VERDICT: Simple design but heavy and not particularly versatile. 2/5 . FOR NON-STOP STEAMKarcher SC 5.800C, £349.99, karcher.co.ukThe Rolls-Royce of steamers, this vacuum-style model has two tanks for non-stop floor cleaning, while the hose turns into a handheld gun.Jenny says: Looking like a squat yellow ladybird, this fancy steamer needs a decent amount of cupboard space. The manual looks like War And Peace, but that’s mainly because it has a section for almost every language on Earth. More diagrams and tips would have helped, although one gem about pouring vinegar on limescale before steaming was ingenious. The large, easy-to-fill tank took about three minutes to heat up, and while it wasn’t very quiet, it was incredibly powerful — even with the dial only turned up halfway. The mop attachment made light work of my kitchen floor. Once finished, I simply unclipped it and used the hose and gun to blitz areas like my sink and the inside of a pedal bin (where chemical cleaners had failed). I’d have liked some smaller brushes for things such as grouting, but otherwise it’s impressive. VERDICT: Large but powerful, for those serious about steaming. 3/5 . The models are said to kill 99 per cent of germs without the use of a single chemical . FOR RETRO GOOD LOOKSHoover SteamJet Cylinder Steam Cleaner SCB1500, £79.99, ArgosThis retro-style cylinder steamer promises to be powerful yet compact, with accessories for more than 25 cleaning tasks stored on board.Jenny says: This clever gadget has all the tools you need — from brushes to a wire scrubber for barbecue grills — inside the base, meaning there’s no need to root around in the cupboard. A funky red design, it’s made to sit on the floor, but it’s not too heavy and has just an A4-sized footprint. There’s a long hose and while the steam gun looks basic, it delivers a powerful blast and has a handy lock to keep steam in when not in use. It cleaned floors thoroughly, and was good at smaller jobs, too, such as polishing work surfaces and refreshing sofas. It heated up in around three minutes (quicker than the five stated on the box), and my only gripes are the difficult-to-read steam control knob and the slightly faffy lid to the water tank. VERDICT: Good-looking, versatile, and great value for the price. 3/5 . DEEP CLEAN STEAMMorphy Richards Power Steam Pro Pulsonic Steam Mop, £74.99, ebuyer.comDesigned to refresh carpets and leave hard floors sparkling, the pulsating floor head claims to agitate ground-in dirt for a deeper clean.Jenny says: Of all the steamers I tried, this was the quickest to assemble and fill, thanks to the removable tank. It stands up on its own when not in use, has an anti-limescale cartridge for hard water, and a fold-down handle for easy storage. The cord isn’t as long as some models, but the buttons were easy to understand, and it heated up in 30 seconds. It’s not light and took a bit of effort to mop my kitchen — I was so vigorous the cloth came off the head — but the amount of dirt it picked up was really noticeable. Having said that, I’m not sure the vibrate function made much difference — it seemed to lift one stubborn stain just as well without it. VERDICT: Put the effort in and you’ll be left with pristine floors. 3/5 . Jenny found steam cleaners can even be used on furniture such as sofas . DRIES FLOORS AS IT GOESShark Lift-Away Steam Pocket 5-in-1, £149.99, jmldirect.comA mop-style model with ‘pocket technology’ to leave floors dry and streak-free. It also has a detachable handheld gun for smaller jobs.Jenny says: This steamer is so efficient at drying floors after cleaning, you wonder if it’s worked at all! Thankfully, the grubby mop cloth showed it must have done the job. A lot of thought has been put into the whole thing — from the decent-sized mop head, long cord and comprehensive instructions to the handy bag for attachments and the loops on the cloths to stop you from scalding yourself when you remove them. It took about 30 seconds to reach steam, and the middle section lifts out to become a handheld steamer. The attachments are a little on the large side — the brush was too big to get behind my bath taps — and it’s not that easy to tell if the machine’s on or off, but overall, it tackles a wide range of tasks well. VERDICT: A good all-rounder for most jobs in the home. 4/5 . Jenny tries out one of the models on her shower . SMALL AND SIMPLELight’n’Easy Steam Mop, £39.99, LakelandCreated to clean large, flat areas such as windows and tiles, or for sanitising bedding, this handheld flat steamer is one of the smallest and cheapest on the market.Jenny says: On the plus side, getting started is a doddle. Simply stick a washable cleaning pad to the base, fill the tank and plug it in. However, rather than taking 30-60 seconds to heat up, as claimed on the box, I was still waiting three minutes later. Once it was working, though, it was simple enough to use, and perfect for running over mattresses and pillows like an iron to sanitise them (steam wipes out dust mites, which can exacerbate allergies). It fared reasonably on tiles too, but with a short flex, a gentle steam output and no attachments, it’s really only useful for flat surfaces.  VERDICT: Only good for mattresses and flat surfaces. 2/5 .","Sales of steam cleaners have increased by 94 per cent at John Lewis in the last year .

Steve Potter, 40, says he was in ‘utter disbelief’ after finding a 5ft snake in the vehicle outside his office. It is thought that the North American red corn snake, which is not venomous despite its vivid markings, belonged to someone who had hired the van to move house. The 5ft North American Corn snake was spotted in the back of the van by Steve Potter from Greater Manchester . Luckily the reptile, despite its distinctive colouring is not poisonous . ‘It seems an odd thing to forget,’ said Mr Potter, 40, from Worsley in Greater Manchester. ‘You can leave a suitcase or some old bedding behind, but not a snake.’ He had a hard time convincing colleagues of his find until workmate Rachel Bettison had a look. ‘Most of the people in the building were alerted by her scream,’ said Mr Potter. He returned the vehicle to Bury Van Hire, who called a reptile expert to catch the snake and are now trying to trace the owner.","The North American Red Corn snake is not poisonous despite its colouring .

"By . Richard Spillett . Two senior policemen face jail after they were caught stealing from a fake 'crime scene' in a sting operation set up by their own colleagues. Detective Sergeant Stephen Phillips and Detective Constable Jason Evans were filmed on secret cameras taking cash and pens planted by their fellow officers. A court heard today how Phillips, 45, was caught taking £250 when he was called to a house colleagues told him was 'under criminal investigation'. Detective Sergeant Stephen Phillips (left) stole money from a house in South Wales and Detective Constable Jason Evans (right) pocketed pens . Evans, 44, was also vidoed pocketing two pens while he carried out the investigation using a search warrant. Both men however left other items put out by suspicious colleagues as part of the sting - including sex aid Viagra tablets. The court heard the officers thought they were investigating a burglary but the scene was in fact set up as part of 'trust exercise' by police chiefs. A team of officers including Evans and Phillips were sent to the house which was filled with 'evidence' including the Viagra, bags, mobile phones, watches and £21,647 of cash. But they didn't realise the property had been fitted with hidden cameras and covert microphones - and a woman posing as a resident was an undercover detective. The pair - who have been suspended by South Wales Police - admitting theft today and were warned they faced custody. Judge Bodfan Jenkins told them: 'There can be few examples of a graver breach of trust. This is a gross breach of trust in relation to the force and what the public expect from the police. The pair were sent to a fake 'crime scene' by their colleagues, who had planted secret cameras in the property . 'It's not about the cost, it's about the breach of trust and at first blush it appears to me that this is a custody case.' The officers, who are based in Neath, near Swansea, were part of a team investigating organised crime but ended up being investigated themselves by South Wales Police's corruption unit for theft and misconduct. Cardiff Magistrates Court heard how the force decided to carry out an 'integrity test' on the pair. They . pretended they were asked by Greater Manchester Police to investigate a . property allegedly linked to a series of burglaries. Officers left Viagra tablets at the property as part of the sting operation . Prosecutor David Roberts said: 'Phillips was filmed putting his hand inside a coat pocket and finding £240. 'He removes his hand and leaves the scene - but then returns 20 seconds later when he removes the cash and places it in his pocket.' Phillips also took £10 from a bedside table. But he did not realise all the notes had been marked with invisible ink and the serial numbers recorded. Evans was filmed going into the bedroom and taking two pens during the raid in March this year. The pair then drove up the M5 to meet plain clothes officers from Greater Manchester Police at a service station. While waiting for the meeting, Phillips spent £60 of money on a Monopoly-themed gambling machine. As they drove back to South Wales they were pulled over by a marked police car and arrested by members of their force's Professional Standards department. The court heard Phillips, of Skewen, Neath, claimed he was going to return the money to the woman who lived at the house. Evans, of Cilfrew, Neath, admitted stealing the pens while he was interviewed under caution. The pair have both pleaded guilty to theft and are on unconditional bail while reports are prepared ahead of their sentencing hearing.","Policemen Stephen Phillips and Jason Evans were suspected of dishonesty .

"By . Richard Spillett . A lucky hillwalker was given a personal air show by the most famous aerobatics team in the world when he witnessed a training session by the RAF's Red Arrows. Dave Savage, 43, was enjoying a peaceful walk through the Mach Loop hills in central Wales when the stillness of his surroundings was broken by the roar of the afterburner jet engines from the iconic aircraft. The nine-plane flying team were using the area to practice low-level flying ahead of this summer's air shows, allowing Mr Savage to get some of the first pictures of their new Union Flag tail design, painted on to mark their 50th anniversary. The father-of-three said: 'It was spectacular, exciting, noisy and totally unforgettable. It was like they were putting on a show just for me. 'It was such a buzz when the planes went screaming past. Sometimes I didn't even lift my camera up because I was just standing there in amazement.' The Red Arrows had left their base in Lincolnshire in singles before flying through the loop - named after the nearby town of Machynlleth - and then heading back to their headquarters. Mr Savage, from Newtown, Powys, was able to climb up the hillside so he was higher than the Red Hawk T1 aircraft which were at times just 200ft above the ground . Mr Savage said: 'I've always been aircraft mad and I've seen the Red Arrows in airshows up and down the country. But this was the closest I've ever been to them - I could see the pilots quite clearly' The aerobatics team were practicing low-level flying in the Welsh hills, and buzzed hill walkers at speeds of up to 500mph . Mr Savage, who said the experience was like having his own personal air show, was just yards from some of the passing aircraft . The famous red aircraft snaked around the Mach Loop hills - named after the nearby town of Machynlleth - before heading back to their base in Lincolnshire . Hillwalkers looked on awe-struck as the pilots practiced using their famous red, white and blue vapour trails . The Red Arrows, officially the Royal Air Force Aerobatic Team, performed their first display on May 6, 1965 at Little Rissington, Gloucestershire. Now numbering nine members – all volunteers – they have appeared at events in more than 50 countries around the world showcasing the skills of RAF pilots. The planes are painted red for health and safety reasons – red being most visible in the sky – although officially it is in tribute to the Red Pelicans, their predecessors as an air aerobatic team. The Red Arrows whose motto is Éclat, meaning brilliance, have been based at RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire since December 21, 2000. Three pilots are changed every year, so that there are always three first-year pilots, three second-year pilots, and three in their final year. The pilots always fly in the same place in the formation and if one is unwell then they fly in an eight-man formation. However, if the lead pilot is unable to fly, then the team's performance is cancelled. In 2010 Flt Lt Kirsty Moore became the first female Red Arrow pilot. Mr Savage's photos are thought to be among the first to show the Red Arrows aircraft with their new Union Flag tail colours, which they have had painted on to celebrate their 50th display season . Unveiling the new design earlier this year, Squadron Leader Jim Turner said: 'We are extremely proud of our heritage and we hope this tailfin design brings with it a sense of pride for both past members of the team and for members of the public to share' After taking the incredible close-up photos, Mr Savage said: 'I have explained to friends what it is like but its not you have to be there to get the full thrill. I would recommend it to anyone just to experience it once in their life' The team will put on 85 displays in nine countries during the 2014 display season, which runs from the end of May until the close of September . Many of the pilots have recent frontline experience with the RAF and use skills gained during combat training during the hair-raising routines .","Dave Savage managed to get amazing close-up photos of the display team when he was walking in the Welsh hills .

"By . Tim Shipman, Deputy Political Editor . Commons Speaker John Bercow claims some female MPs have stopped attending Prime Minister's Questions . Commons Speaker John Bercow has claimed that women MPs have stopped attending Prime Minister’s Questions because of the rowdy atmosphere. He said that several female politicians have been put off by the ‘histrionics and cacophony of noise’ when David Cameron is quizzed every Wednesday. Mr Bercow suggested that ‘seasoned parliamentarians’ boycotted the frequently boisterous sessions out of embarrassment, while other women did not want to take part in the session because it was ‘so bad’. He said: ‘I think it is a big deal. I think it is a real problem. A number of seasoned parliamentarians, who are not shrinking violets, not delicate creatures at all, are saying, “This is so bad that I am not going to take part, I am not going to come along, I feel embarrassed by it. ‘People with a lot to contribute are reluctant to engage because they think that the histrionics and cacophony of noise are so damaging as to cause them to look elsewhere. But I’m sorry if some of those people are lost to the chamber because they think, “I’m not going to take part in that atmosphere”.’ But defence minister Anna Soubry, who sits on the back row of the green benches among the ‘awkward squad’ of MPs, warned that Mr Bercow was perpetuating ‘old fashioned’ views of women by singling them out. She told the Mail: ‘I’m getting very concerned about these stereotypical views of female MPs. Some of the most vocal people in PMQs are women on both sides of the chamber. ‘The Eagle sisters for Labour are more than robust and perfectly able but my goodness they can dish it out. ‘From my vantage point I regularly see Fiona Mactaggart heckling. Emily Thornberry can bellow with the best of them. A lot of the people the Speaker tells off are Tory women: myself, Claire Perry and Therese Coffey. David Cameron speaks during Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons. The Speaker say some MPs boycot the session . ‘I’m sure there are people on both sides who don’t like this aspect of the Commons but it’s got nothing at all to do with sex. I think it’s completely wrong. ‘I’m rather concerned by this idea and the constant reinforcement of the stereotype that all women are shrinking violets. It’s a very old fashioned view of us.’ Former MP Louise Mensch said that women MPs ‘all love PMQs’ and said Mr Bercow should ‘call a few more women’ to ask questions. She added: ‘I am a fan of the Speaker, but he’s wrong on PMQs and wrong that women are tea-sipping flowers with the vapours.’ MP Anna Soubry has hit back saying Mr Bercow was perpetuating 'old fashioned' views . Mr Bercow said Parliament was ‘spray painting its own shop window’ by appearing to generate more noise than the band Deep Purple. He has also written to David Cameron and Labour leader Ed Miliband over his concerns about the raucous nature of Prime Minister’s Questions, warning it is putting off voters. Yesterday he revealed they have both written back ‘but there’s not yet much by way of a specific commitment’.","Speaker says rowdy atmosphere means female MPs stay away from PMQs .

"By . Jason Groves . The personal financial details of millions of taxpayers could be sold to private firms under Government plans that have been branded ‘borderline insane’. HM Revenue and Customs last night confirmed it was planning a change in the law to allow the release of ‘anonymised’ data to third parties – despite warnings it could lead to a catastrophic privacy breach. A consultation issued by the department says it is looking at ‘charging options’, but says the aim is to share data with researchers and companies in order to benefit the public. HM Revenue and Customs (pictured) said last night that it was planning to change the law to allow the release of 'anonymised' data to third parties - despite warnings it could lead to a catastrophic data breach . It remains unclear exactly what data HMRC could be allowed to share in the future. Officials insisted it would be impossible to identify the details of any individual taxpayer, preserving their confidentiality. But critics warned it could follow the catastrophic example of the NHS’s Care.data scheme, which has been delayed after it emerged that supposedly anonymised data included key personal details like postcodes, dates of birth and NHS numbers. Former shadow secretary David Davis  described the proposal as 'borderline insane' Former shadow home secretary David Davis . described the proposal as ‘borderline insane’ and said the Treasury had . listed ‘no credible benefits’ to support the move. The senior Tory added: ‘The officials who drew this up clearly have no idea of the risks to data in an electronic age. Our forefathers put these checks and balances in place when the information was kept in cardboard files, and data was therefore difficult to appropriate and misuse. ‘It defies logic that we would remove those restraints at a time when data can be collected by the gigabyte, processed in milliseconds and transported around the world almost instantaneously.’ Privacy campaigners also raised the alarm. Emma Carr, of Big Brother Watch, said the data could be ‘vulnerable to reidentification’. Stephen Coleclough, of the Chartered Institute of Taxation, said HMRC did not understand the ‘worrying and dangerous’ implications of the move. The Treasury last night confirmed it was pressing ahead with the plans, but insisted safeguards would be put in place to protect privacy.","Personal financial details of millions of taxpayers could be sold to firms .

The company declined to discuss how much the homes are being sold for at this stage. They are an integral part of British social history - homes fit for heroes. Rising from the rubble in the wake of the devastating bombing Britain endured at the hands of the Nazis during the Second World War, came the prefabricated home. Built on top of pre-plumbed concrete slabs, prefabs could be ready in a day, constructed by teams of German and Italian prisoners-of-war. They give an insight into what life was like post-Second World War for vast swathes of the population left homeless during the Blitz and the German bombing campaign. Hector Murdoch arrives home from the Second World War, after spending three years in Japanese captivity. He is greeted by his wife Roshina and their son John, at the family's new prefab home on the Excalibur estate in Catford, south London . Soldiers returning from the front line would find their families waiting brimming with excitement on the doorsteps of the purpose built homes. One iconic image shows Hector Murdoch arriving back from war, on his birthday, after three years in Japanese captivity. His wife, Rosina, is dressed in her Sunday best. And the couple's son John bouncing on the spot, finally seeing the father he has hero-worshipped from afar. In the background stands the family's brand new prefab home on the Excalibur estate in Catford south east London. War time Prime Minister Winston Churchill first envisaged the need for prefab homes in March 1944, legally outlining the plans in the Housing (Temporary Accomodation) Act of 1944. At the time the anticipated shortfall in post-war housing stock stood at 200,000 and the idea was to build 500,000 purpose-built homes to plug the gap. They were designed to last 10 years, by which time the prefabs would be replaced by high-rise council estates. The eventual bill agreed under Clement Atlee's government provided for 300,000 homes to be built within 10 years to a budget of £150 million. Of the 1.2million new homes were built from 1945 to 1951, When the programme came to an end, only 156,623 prefabs had been constructed. In Britain the term prefab home will forever be linked with the post-war estates that sprang up in towns and cities, as an answer to the homes shortage. For more than 150,000 homeless, bombed-out families in Britain, these two-bedroom prefabs were designed as a temporary solution. But their inhabitants loved them - detached houses, with the luxury of a garden, a bathroom and a separate indoor toilet. They were designed to last a decade, just long enough to rescue post-war Britons and allow enough time to build sprawling estates so longed for at the time. But as high-rise tower blocks sprung up across the country, people discovered they hated living in the blocks. And those prefab residents, who came so attached to their post-war temporary homes, refused to move, staying put. Residents have fought council plans to tear down estates. Bristol has one of the largest remaining populations of prefab housing. There remain around 700 homes - 16 of which English Heritage selected for Grade II listed buildings status. The Excalibur estate in Catford was one of the UK's largest estates, featuring 187 homes on one site. While residents fought to save the entire estate, English Heritage wanted to save 21 examples, while the council, the London Borough of Lewisham which owned the majority of the estate wanted to tear the lot down. In September 2009 the Department for Culture, Media and Sport agreed to Grade II list six of the least altered bungalows for preservation. More than 150,000 prefab homes were built in post-war Britain to plug the shortfall left after bombing devastated the country .","Britain's first 'instant' homes billed as 'solution to the housing crisis'

"By . Julian Robinson . The remarkable story of how a free-falling wartime pilot was saved when the beam of a searchlight enabled him to locate his parachute has emerged for the first time. Squadron Leader Barry Douetil plunged out of his blazing Lancaster bomber at 20,000ft and was horrified when he realised his parachute wasn't strapped to his body. It was only when he hurtled for a split second through the bright beam of the German searchlight that he spotted it was on the end of a strap 10ft above him. Barry Douetil, pictured, was plunging 20,000ft from a burning Lancaster bomber during the Second World War when he realised his parachute was not strapped to his body . While still falling through the air in the dark, the 21-year-old managed to rein the cord in until he was able to put the parachute on and pull the release cord in the nick of time. He landed heavily ten seconds later in a frozen field but escaped the 1944 near-death experience with just a dislocated shoulder. He was picked up by the Germans and taken to the infamous Stalag Luft III camp just six weeks before the 'Great Escape' attempt by nearly 100 Allied PoWs. The incredible wartime story will be told for the first time 70 years on by Sq Ldr Douetil's son when he appears on BBC1's Antiques Roadshow this weekend. Squadron Leader Barry Douetil, pictured fourth from left, with the ill-fated crew of the Lancaster bomber. The 21-year-old used a beam of light to locate his parachute, which was not strapped to his body, as he was plunging towards earth from the burning aircraft . After locating his parachute in mid air thanks to a German search light, Squadron Leader Barry Douetil, pictured, was able to haul in his parachute, strap himself in and land hard in a field just ten seconds later . Philip Douetil, from Pirbright, Surrey, took along to the show a poignant photo of his late father with the rest of his Lancaster crew, five of whom died in the crash. He also presented experts with a written account his father gave of his own great escape that took place over Hannover on the night of February 19, 1944. Sq Ldr Douetil was on his 14th bombing mission to Leipzig in eastern Germany when the Lancaster was attacked by a Focke-Wulf 190 nightfighter plane. In his own words, Sq Ldr Douetil said: 'Cannon shells hit the starboard wing setting it alight. I could feel the impact of the hits through my hands on the control column. After landing heavily and dislocating his shoulder following his incredible plunge from 20,000ft, Squadron Leader Barry Douetil ended up a prisoner of war in the infamous German camp Stalag Luft IIIG. The telegram pictured, was sent to his parents' home in Surrey, confirming that he had been captured . Squadron Leader Barry Douetil was on his 14th bombing mission to Liepzig in eastern Germany when the Lancaster was attacked by a Focke-Wulf 190 nightfighter plane . 'I could also hear the noise of the flames above the noise of the engines. 'Sgt John Gill, flight engineer, undid the seat belt and attached a chest type parachute onto my harness. 'A short while later the aircraft rolled onto its back and I fell onto the cockpit canopy, together with the flight engineer, which seemed to give way. 'I found myself falling rapidly in the darkness at about 20,000ft. 'It was cold and breathless, but I could still hear the noise of the bomber stream.

'I landed heavily in a frozen ploughed field, on the outskirts of Hannover, with a dislocated left shoulder.' Philip . Douetil, 66, said: 'My father later told me that he was probably . falling through the air for about five minutes and pulled the parachute . open 10 seconds before he hit the ground. 'It . was only because he went through the beam of the searchlight for a . split second that he realised the parachute was still attached to him . and he had the nowse to put it on despite free-falling to the ground. 'He was very reluctant to talk about it, until the latter part of his life when I made him write down his experiences. 'I think he probably just felt a degree of guilt about the loss of his crew when he survived. 'Up until now it has just been the family who knew about it.'

Politicians are ‘tinkering’ with the justice system by inventing new ways to help criminals avoid jail, a senior judge has warned. Judge Richard Bray, who retired last week, fired a parting shot at Governments for introducing the raft of ‘warnings, reprimands and cautions’ that allow offenders to dodge appearing in court. The proper role of politicians, he said, was to make sure there was enough jail space for everyone that judges thought needed to be locked up. But instead they were turning judges into ‘civil servants’ by influencing the sentences they hand down. He also condemned police officers for fiddling crime figures by downgrading offences. The outspoken circuit judge made his comments last week as he stepped down from the role he has occupied for 21 years. The judge won plaudits from the public when, in 2007, he refused to comply with a demand from the then Labour Home Secretary John Reid that only dangerous criminals should be sent to prison. At the time, he said the reason prisons were full was that judges were prevented from passing ‘deterrent sentences’. His latest comments were made at an event to mark his retirement at Northampton Crown Court. He said there was too much meddling with sentencing which was designed to save money and place fewer people behind bars. He said: ‘Over the years I’ve seen a number of Government initiatives with sentencing. We’ve had suspended sentences introduced, abolished then introduced again. ‘All this tinkering about is more to do with money and votes rather than criminal justice, while all the while the prison population has continued to rise. None of the Government initiatives have worked. ‘The final solution the Government has reached is by preventing courts from being given the chance to send offenders to prison and make their savings that way. ‘We’ve now got warnings, reprimands, cautions, conditional discharges that prevent people from appearing in court.’ The judge said police had ‘massaged’ the crime figures. ‘Robbery . is now classified as ‘theft from a person’, burglary is downgraded to . criminal damage. Cautions and reprimands are used to save police time,’ he added. ‘Magistrates’ courts are withering away and have been closed down as the number of criminal cases decreases. ‘But . you ask the people who walk about the streets of towns and cities at . night if crime has gone down and they will give you a very different . picture.’ Britian's Home Secretary John Reid, centre, and former London Metropolitan Police Commissioner Ian Blair, right . The judge, who lists his interests in Who’s Who as Cricket, Real tennis and gardening, admitted his ‘guiding philosophy’ was always to do justice without fear or favour and ‘to speak frankly where necessary in the public interest’. He said governments had reduced judges sentencing powers to governments reducing sentencing to what amounted to a ‘tick in a box’. He said it was wrong of government to tell judges what to do, but ‘up to the executive to make sure they have enough spaces in prison for the judge to send them to.’ The ability of judges to make decisions without fear of influence from Government was ‘potentially at risk’, he added. ‘We are almost being treated as if we are civil servants and distributing power and influence on behalf of the Government. ‘We are being described as ‘stakeholders’ in the criminal justice system. ‘Those who want to become judges have to sit exams and attend interviews where they have to spout political correctness like civil servants. We’ll soon have full inspections of judges.’ Peter Cuthbertson, director of the Centre for Crime Prevention said: ‘Judge Bray is absolutely right to point to how politicians restrict the courts’ ability to punish serious criminals. ‘Prison is the only sure way to protect the public from serious, repeat offenders, and the cost of more prison places is much lower than the cost of crimes they committed.’ ‘Politicians should be encouraging judges to protect the public, not pushing them to be lenient towards criminals they know are a threat to others.’ The judge’s courtroom was infamous for its tough sentences, and local criminals spoke of being ‘Brayed’ by the judge. Earlier this year he compared the UK’s borders to a ‘leaking sieve’ after he jailed an Albanian drug dealer who had been deported three times previously.","Judge fires parting shot at the politicians 'tinkering' with justice system .

"David Beckham has hit a major hurdle in his plans to build a 25,000-seat stadium in Miami to home Major League Soccer's next franchise. An alliance of shipping businesses and a billionaire car dealer have launched a campaign protesting the Englishman's development in the Port of Miami in Florida, which would include a restaurant anda nightclub. The consortium made their opposition clear in a full-page advertisement in two major newspapers on Monday, claiming the stadium would threaten the city's plans to capitalise on the expansion of the Panama Canal if it should go ahead as planned. Under fire: David Beckham's plans for a 25,000-seater stadium in Miami are facing powerful opposition . New stadium: The first designs for Beckham's planned state-of-the-art stadium have been revealed . Open letter: The Miami Seaport Alliance took out full-page ads in the Miami Herald and El Nuevo Herald (pictured) on Monday explaining their opposition to Beckham's plans for a 25,000-seater stadium in Miami . The as-yet-unnamed stadium, funded by Beckham and his partners, would annually host 17 MLS games, as well as additional post-season fixtures, friendlies, and other entertainment. In the Miami Herald and its sister Spanish-language paper, El Nuevo Herald, the Miami Seaport Alliance told Beckham: 'We cannot jeopardise well-paying jobs, like crane operators, longshore workers, and mechanics, for low-paying stadium jobs, such as concession sales.' The group is being led by John Fox, the retired as Royal Caribbean Cruise Line's head of governmental affairs, and includes billionaire car dealer Norman Braman, who owned the Philadelphia Eagles from 1985-1994. Beckham's group also faces opposition from two chapters of the International Longshoremen's Association and two stevedore companies, whose workers load and unload ships. ‘There are plenty of other places for the stadium to be,’ Braman said. Against: John Fox (left) is leading a consortium of shipping groups and business leaders, including billionaire car dealer and former Philadelphia Eagles owner Norman Braman (right) who are against Beckham's stadium . Tourist attraction: The venue would host 17 MLS games, as well as additional post-season games . Impressive plans: Beckham's stadium at the Port of Miami would feature a nightclub and restaurants . Prime real estate: Port of Miami is one of the world's busiest ports . The English former football player last month unveiled detailed plans for a 25,000-seat waterfront stadium . on the island port with sweeping views of downtown Miami. Development of the 36-acre space would cost about $200m and include shops, hotels and offices connected to the mainland by a pedestrian bridge. The port is one of four potential areas for the new stadium, which Beckham's team say will create a new destination for Miami residents. Grand designs: A Royal Caribbean cruise ship docked near Miami, where the company has its headquarters . Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez said: ‘There’s nothing concrete, there's no recommendation pending.’ The port's master plan calls for the development of more than 7m-sq-ft of convention, hotel and office space on the same site. Before Monday's ad, only Royal Caribbean, which is headquartered at the port, has come out publicly against Beckham's plan. Neisen Kasdin, an attorney for Akerman Senterfitt and adviser for the Beckham group, said: ‘The plan doesn't interfere with port operations. In front of the mic: Beckham attended a press conference in Miami back in February with commissioner Don Garber (left) and Mayor Carlos Gimenez (right) ‘It will likely generate more revenue for the port in the shorter term than other concepts that have been discussed.’ Yet a growing list of opponents say a stadium would jeopardise Miami's aspiration of becoming a more attractive choice for global shippers looking to distribute goods to the US market. Neither Braman nor Fox would say who paid for the two ads in Monday's papers, worth nearly $25,000. ‘I haven't given any dollars yet but I would if asked,’ Braman added. A force to be reckoned with: David and Victoria Beckham have passed on their entrepreneurial spirit to their children .","David Beckham plans to build a $200m stadium and entertainment complex .

"By . Hugo Gye . A gold ring made by the wealthy money lender who founded the Grosvenor Estate has been found in a field by a treasure hunter. The 24-carat piece of jewellery was a 'mourning ring' made in memory of Hugh Audley, who owned the land where Buckingham Palace would later be built. It was found near Tibenham in Norfolk by John Reed using his metal detector, and was yesterday declared treasure trove by a coroner. Treasure: This mourning ring was made in memory of Hugh Audley, a famous money lender . Discovery: The ring was found by enthusiast John Reed using his metal detector in Tibenham, Norfolk . Hugh Audley was one of the most famous - and notorious - money lenders of the 17th century, and was worth the equivalent of £30million when he died. He owned land across Mayfair, which was then on the edge of London, including the plot where Buckingham Palace would later be built. Audley Street in Mayfair, now home to upmarket art galleries and exclusive restaurants, is named after its former landlord. Among the businesses on the street which cater to the ultra-rich are rifle makers James Purdey & Sons and the Michelin-starred Chinese restaurant Kai Mayfair. Property: Audley owned the land where Buckingham Palace now stands, then just outside London . Home: The remains of Old Buckenham Castle, one of the many properties owned by Audley . Legacy: Audley Street in Mayfair is named after the landowner and money lender . Audley also became sheriff of Norfolk, and owned land across the county including Old Buckenham Castle, New Buckenham Castle and Tibenham Hall. After he died in 1662, he passed his fortune to a great-nephew, and it was eventually inherited by the Grosvenor family from which the Duke of Westminster is descended. The Grosvenor Estate still owns swathes of central London, centred on the ultra-wealthy areas of Mayfair and Belgravia. Audley also left a number of mourning rings to his family, like the one found by Mr Reed. Contrast:  This engraving shows London Bridge in 1616, around the time that Audley was trading in land . Rural: This engraving shows how the area beyond Westminster, including St James's and Mayfair, was considered part of the countryside during the 17th century . Mourning rings were usually commissioned by people coming to the end of their lives and bequeathed to their descendants in order to ensure that their memory was perpetuated down the generations. The rings were made of precious metals and jewels, and often contained a lock of the deceased person's hair. 'According to Mr Audley's will, he had 11 rings made in two different sizes - one to fit men and the other for women,' Mr Reed said. 'I haven't heard that any of the others are in existence.' Burial place: Hugh Audley was laid to rest in the Temple Church after he died in 1662 . Hugh Audley (1577-1662) apparently started his career with just £100, and was worth £400,000 - the equivalent of around £30million - by the time he died. He was known as a philosopher and a lawyer - but it was as a money lender that he made his vast fortune and won widespread notoriety. Audley used his riches to invest in land, with his most prominent estate being the manor of Ebury in what is now Mayfair. He bought the land from Lionel Cranfield, Earl of Middlesex, who was desperate for money to pay his debts, and after his death passed it on to his great-nephew. The estate was then inherited by Mary Davies, who married an ancestor of the current Duke of Westminster, now one of London's biggest landowners. Audley was buried in the Temple Church, befitting his status as a lawyer - but his death brought forward a stream of invective from those he had taken advantage of. A pamphlet on his life entitled 'The Way to be Rich' claimed that he had lived 'a life of intricacies and misteries, wherein he walked as in a maze', while a later author wrote: 'His whole life was one of trickery and disreputable craft.' In the Victorian era, Audley was remembered as 'a most heartless blood-sucker' and was posthumously condemned by Benjamin Disraeli. The enthusiast added: 'I am so excited about it. 'I have found some lovely 13th-century thimbles but not something you can associate with a specific person like this. 'If I keep metal detecting for the next 20 years, I don't think I will ever find anything as good as this.' The ring is currently being held at the British Museum, and its fate has yet to be determined after the coroner ruled that it should pass into the hands of the Crown. The Grosvenor Estate, which includes much of central London, is one of the largest and wealthiest landowners in Britain. It is now owned by the 6th Duke of Westminster, a member of the Grosvenor family, but it has its origins in the property owned by Hugh Audley. The Grosvenor family inherited the Ebury estate, covering most of what is now Mayfair, Belgravia and Pimlico, via Audley's great-niece Mary Davies. Wealthy: The Duke of Westminster, left, has been enriched by the legacy left to his family by Hugh Audley; his daughter Edwina is pictured right with her husband Dan Snow . Prime property: Mount Street in Mayfair, at the heart of the Grosvenor property empire . They started developing the area in the 18th century, starting with Grosvenor Square before stretching down into the areas around Eaton Square and Chester Square. Belgravia developed into a popular neighbourhood thanks to the purchase of Buckingham Palace by King George III in 1761, with the area's stylish Regency architecture capturing the neo-classical spirit of the age. The areas owned by the Grosvenor Estate was one of the first extensions of London beyond the traditional boundaries of the City and Westminster, transforming regions once thought of as suburban or even rural into fashionable central London neighbourhoods. Much of the estate is named after properties owned by the Grosvenor family - for example, Eaton Square is named after their country seat of Eaton Hall in Cheshire, while Wilton Crescent is named for their relative the Earl of Wilton. While parts of the estate have been sold off over the centuries, the Grosvenor Group still owns much of central London as well as properties in other cities around Britain and elsewhere. The group holds large portfolios in cities including Liverpool, Edinburgh, Shanghai, Tokyo and Washington DC. The company is run by professional property executives, but its only shareholders are a group of trustees who manage the holding on behalf of the Grosvenor family. Origins: This image shows Grosvenor Square shortly after the initial development of Mayfair . Home: Eaton Hall in Cheshire is the main country house of the Duke of Westminster . Thanks to the family's extensive holdings, the current Duke of Westminster is worth £7.8billion, putting him at number eight on the Rich List - and everyone above him was born abroad. He grew up on an island in the middle of Northern Ireland's Lough Erne before being educated at Harrow, where he obtained two O-levels. The Duke then went to Sandhurst and became an officer in the North Irish Horse, later working the the Ministry of Defence as Assistant Chief of the Defence Staff. The Grosvenors are one of the few British families to be wealthier than the Royals, but there are close links between the Duke of Westminster and the Windsors. One of the Duke's personal properties is a hunting estate in Cordoba, southern Spain where Princes William and Harry went for a shooting holiday earlier this year. His son Earl Grosvenor is godfather to Prince George and his daughter Lady Tamara is married to Edward van Cutsem, a family friend of the Duke of Cambridge. Another daughter, Lady Edwina Grosvenor, is married to television presenter Dan Snow, whose father is political pundit Peter Snow.","Gold 'mourning ring' was made in memory of Hugh Audley, who owned vast estates in Mayfair .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . Jeremy Paxman has been scolded by the boss of Radio 1 after claiming the station’s music made travelling in BBC lifts ‘hell’. The Newsnight presenter was told he should ‘take the stairs’ if he did not like tunes from the youth music station piped into elevators. In a terse email fired off by Radio 1 controller Ben Cooper, the 63-year-old was also asked to keep his outspoken views under control. Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman, who has been scolded by the boss of Radio 1 after claiming that listening to the station's music while he was in the lift was 'hell' Mr Cooper, who has been in charge of Radio 1 since 2011 and is paid £161,600 a year, responded within hours of reading Paxman’s remarks earlier this week. His email, which has been seen by the Daily Mail, was copied to other senior managers. It said: ‘Dear Jeremy, I read with interest your views on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra. I am Controller of both. ‘Clearly you are entitled to your view, but please consider who and what you effect [sic] when you express those views.’ Just in case Paxman was in any doubt as to how much he had angered senior management, Mr Cooper – who said he is a fan of Newsnight – added: ‘If all this falls on deaf ears then my only other suggestion is to take the stairs.’ The row came after Paxman launched an astonishing attack on the BBC this week, calling his employer ‘smug’, criticising the payoff scandal and claiming it ‘distorts the marketplace’ with its news operation. But it was his attack on Radio 1 that ruffled the most feathers at the corporation. Radio 1 boss Ben Cooper wrote an email to Jeremy Paxman inviting him to 'take the stairs' after the Newsnight presenter said listening to the station's music in lifts was 'hell' He said: ‘There’s a pile of stuff on the BBC I can’t stand. My idea of hell is going down in one of the lifts in that ghastly new building [New Broadcasting House] in a lift which has Radio 1Xtra plumbed into it. I don’t quite understand why the BBC does Radio 1Xtra. ‘I don’t really understand why it does Radio 1. Clearly, you can meet those needs commercially.’However, Mr Cooper defended his stations and said the BBC’s commercial rivals are unable to provide a comparable service. He said: ‘Commercial radio targeted at young listeners does not win awards for documentaries about domestic abuse in teenage relationships, it does not have two 15-minute news programmes in its daytime output listened to by more young people than watch the  10 O’Clock News, and it does not play 65 hours of specialist music  a week.’ He added: ‘If the licence fee is collected from everyone, then the BBC should represent the whole of society, not just certain parts of it.’ It is understood BBC senior management are increasingly frustrated by stars who criticise the corporation in public. Radio 4 presenter John Humphrys has claimed the BBC is ‘grotesquely over-managed’ and had a ‘broadly liberal’ bias, while Question Time host David Dimbleby said it was ‘too big for its own good’. However one BBC source said: ‘The problem is, we hire people like Paxman because they are outspoken and they know their own minds. We don’t want a bunch of yes men in news and we can’t tell them to shut up. But it would be nice if they stopped biting the hand that feeds them.’","Jeremy Paxman said listening to Radio 1 music made travelling in lifts 'hell'

Jonathan Trott is taking another break from cricket after suffering the same mental issues that forced him to return home early from the Ashes tour. The batsman withdrew from England’s disastrous winter series after the first Test in Brisbane with what the ECB described as a ‘stress-related illness’. He took a four-month break, working with the ECB medical team and a psychologist in an effort to rebuild his career. But after just one LV County Championship Division One game for Warwickshire, in which he scored 37 and 26 in a losing cause against Sussex, the 32-year-old has stepped away from the game again. Ill again: Jonathan Trott's stress-related anxiety has returned . Out of action: Trott had to fly home from the Ashes tour Down Under because of the condition . Jonathan Trott: . 'It was with the best intentions and hope that I returned to cricket with Warwickshire this month. 'Much to my disappointment, since my first game, I have felt the same anxieties that occurred during my time in Australia. 'It is not fair on my team-mates or myself to continue when I am unable to function at 100 per cent. In order to play at the highest level you have to be at 100 per cent and be able to concentrate fully at all times. Sadly I am unable to do this. 'With this in mind I have decided it is best for all involved that I continue my recovery on the sidelines for the time being. 'I would like to thank Warwickshire and the ECB for their continued support through this time.' ECB and Warwickshire: . 'At the completion of the LV=CC match between Warwickshire and Sussex on April 16, 2014 - in which he played - Jonathan experienced a repeat of stress-related symptoms which were diagnosed during England's Ashes series in Australia in the winter. 'Jonathan will now undergo further treatment to assist with his long-term rehabilitation. 'Both parties confirm that their primary concerns are for Jonathan's health and well-being, and reiterate that they will continue to offer him their full support.' Dr Nick Peirce, the ECB's chief medical officer: . 'Jonathan has had a recurrence of the stress related illness that ruled him out of all cricket this winter from late November onwards. 'Despite Jonathan wanting to play for Warwickshire from the start of the season, having spent time with him yesterday [Thursday] it is clear that he will benefit from a further period away from the game. He will continue with the comprehensive support programme the ECB has put in place to assist his rehabilitation.' It is understood this has been a far from easy decision to take for the emotional Trott, but his anxiety levels have been so high that he felt he had no choice for his own wellbeing. Senior English cricket sources told Sportsmail last night that an announcement is expected in the next 24 hours. Trott was unavailable for comment on Thursday night. The news will spark fears the brilliant career of England’s No 3 batsman could be over, but Trott hopes more specialist treatment will enable him to return. In a recent interview, Trott  said he felt he was suffering from ‘burn-out’. But a four-month break has done little to ease the anxiety he appears to be suffering when trying to do his job. In November, as news broke of Trott leaving the Ashes tour, he said: ‘I don’t think it is right that I’m playing knowing that I’m not 100 per cent.’ England coach Andy Flower added at the time: ‘He needs time away from this environment and time with his family.’ Former England captain Michael . Vaughan later criticised Trott after the batsman gave a TV interview . which raised questions about the nature of his problem. ‘I . feel a little bit conned we were told Jonathan Trott’s problems in . Australia were a stress-related illness he had suffered for years,’ Vaughan wrote in a newspaper article. ‘We were allowed to believe he was struggling with a serious mental health issue and treated him with sensitivity and sympathy. He was obviously not in a great place . but he was struggling for cricketing reasons and not mental, and there . is a massive difference.’ Trott batted in all 10 innings when . England retained the Ashes last summer, averaging 29, but he was . dismissed for 10 and nine during the first Test defeat at the Gabba. ‘I cannot currently operate at the level I have done in the past,’ said Trott on his return from Australia. ‘My priority now is to take a break from cricket so that I can focus on my recovery.’ Aborted comeback: Trott, pictured playing a friendly for Warwickshire against Gloucestershire, has appeared twice for his county this season .

"By . Chris Wheeler . Follow @@ChrisWheelerDM . Manchester City's Premier League title hopes have faded dramatically following Wednesday’s 2-2 draw at home to bottom-of-the-table Sunderland, a result described by midfielder Fernandinho as 'a complete disaster'. A team that not so long ago were chasing an unprecedented quadruple now look like finishing Manuel Pellegrini’s first season in charge with just the Capital One Cup to show for their efforts. Sportsmail assesses where it has gone wrong for City, and what Pellegrini must put right in the summer. Falling short: Manchester City's title hopes have taken a tumble following a difficult week on the pitch . Living on a prayer: Manuel Pellegrini needs a minor miracle to overtake Liverpool and Chelsea now . TWO'S KOMPANY . The failure to sign a world-class central defensive partner for captain Vincent Kompany has dogged Pellegrini from the start. Having spent more than £100million in other positions and then failed to prise Pepe from his old club Real Madrid, the City boss settled on Martin Demichelis, a cut-price alternative at £4m. Inspiration and exasperation: Vincent Kompany (left) is world class but Martin Demichelis (right) is a liability . The criticism levelled at the Argentine has not always been entirely fair, but he has emerged as the weak link in the team, despite the almost blind faith shown in him by the manager. City are already making plans to address the issue with talks over a £35m deal for FC Porto’s Eliaquim Mangala well advanced. FLAIR PLAY . Pellegrini insists that he will not curb his attacking instincts but he might have to think again if he wants to get City over the line next season. You cannot fault his team's attacking flair this season in terms of entertainment; they have put six past Arsenal, seven past Norwich, 11 past Tottenham over two games and demolished Manchester United twice in the derby. Blow: City were outfoxed by Chelsea at the Etihad in February, when Branislav Ivanovic scored the winner . However, all six Premier League defeats this season have been by one goal. Against Chelsea at the Etihad in February, Jose Mourinho outfoxed Pellegrini with a counter-attacking masterclass while, at Anfield on Sunday, City’s refusal to sit on a 2-2 draw that would have suited them far more than Liverpool cost them dear. A little less cavalier, a little more caution might go a long way next time. ANCHORMAN II . No-one can question that the £30million deal for Fernandinho last summer was money well spent. The Brazilian has been a key figure for City this season, anchoring the midfield and allowing Yaya Toure the freedom to shine. But City need another defensive midfielder, either to fill in for one of those two or to give Pellegrini the option of pushing Toure into a more advanced position where he can do more damage. Javi Garcia has shown a slight improvement but Jack Rodwell has never settled since moving from Everton, and both players could be offloaded in the summer. City pursued Fernando from FC Porto in January and it would be a surprise if they did not try to resurrect that deal. Set him free: Yaya Toure has been City's driving force... but only when he is allowed to roam the pitch free . STRIKE-OUT . It’s a sign of how much City’s breathtaking goal output has dropped off since the end of January that Sergio Aguero was still the team’s top scorer when he returned to the starting line-up against Sunderland despite a third lengthy layoff of the season. Keeping Aguero free of soft tissue injuries will obviously benefit the team in future, but they may also need to look at bringing in a world-class striker to help him. Fragile: Sergio Aguero is City's star striker but the Argentine has spent three long spells on the sidelines . The Beast, Alvaro Negredo, seems to have lost his bite after a ferocious start, Edin Dzeko continues to divide opinion and may well be sold in the summer despite talk of a new contract, and a succession of injuries have prevented Stevan Jovetic from living up to expectations since his arrival from Fiorentina. Edinson Cavani, Radamel Falcao and Diego Costa could all be on the market this summer, and it will be interesting to see if City are among the bidders despite the constraints of Financial Fair Play. MATTER OF TRUST . Pellegrini acknowledged at the start of the season that he had the strongest squad in the Premier League; he has two top players in each position. And yet, when it has come down it, the manager appears to have had a problem trusting fringe players like Javi Garcia, James Milner, Joleon Lescott and Micah Richards. On the fringes: James Milner has not been trusted by Pellegrini, despite several crucial contributions this term . With City chasing trophies on four fronts for much of the season, it has piled the workload onto his key men, and it is perhaps no coincidence that Yaya Toure, David Silva and Vincent Kompany are among those struggling with injuries as the title race hits the home straight. Pellegrini must either learn to trust his squad players or replace them with some he can.","Manchester City are now third favourites to win the Premier League .
Vincent Kompany has no support in central defence .
Manuel Pellegrini has been too cavalier in his approach .
Fernandinho needs top-class partner in defensive midfield .

Vale have sacked defender Jones and Loft has now been ruled out for the rest of the season with a broken cheekbone. The incident happened on Thursday last week and neither player featured in the 4-2 defeat by Notts County. Damage: Port Vale captain Doug Loft shows off his broken cheekbone after a training ground bust-up with team-mate Daniel Jones . Sacked: Daniel Jones has had his contract terminated by Port Vale after a training ground incident . Injured: Skipper Doug Loft suffered a broken cheekbone during the incident . Issues: Port Vale manager Micky Adams says the club will hold an internal investigation . Vale boss Micky Adams and senior club management have been fully supportive of Loft and plan to hold an internal investigation.But the club have already decided to sack 27-year-old Jones who has a year remaining on his current dealt - captain Loft is contracted until the end of the season. The incident comes as a huge blow to the club who had been targeting a place in the play-offs. Loft has been enjoying some of the best form of his career and has scored nine goals this season after leading the club to automatic promotion last term. Loft's solicitor Paul Dodds said: ‘Doug is genuinely shocked by what has happened to him. He is focusing on obtaining the best treatment so he can get back  playing as quickly as possible. ‘However, given the type of injury, it cannot be ruled out that legal proceedings will follow.’ Speaking about the incident, Loft told Sky Sports News: 'There's a chance (of legal proceedings) but I just want to get my face right and then I will go away and talk with my family and decide about my future. 'I have never had a problem with Jonesy and he has never had one with me, as far as I know. 'We went into a tackle and as I was getting up off the floor he hit me. I fell backwards and sat on the floor, the gaffer sent him in and I went to hospital for X-rays. He texted me on the day and said sorry, that was it.' Loft will be out of contract in the summer and he is frustrated that the chance to possibly put himself in the shop window during the club's remaining four matches has been taken away. He added: 'At the minute I am angry. I have been playing really well and I was getting a lot of interest and I knew that people were watching me. I am annoyed and upset that I will miss the rest of the season.' The defeat to relegation-threatened County now means it is unlikely that Vale will make the play-offs as they are 10 points off with four games left to play. 'It's been a poor week for us,' Vale boss Adams told the BBC. 'For legal reasons, there's very little I can say other than on Thursday there was an incident between two players. 'The training ground incident resulted in one of the players, who I might add is an innocent party to this, receiving a facial injury that has consequently ruled him out for the rest of the season. Ruled out: Loft will miss the remainder of the season after the incident which occurred last Thursday . Trouble: Jones is on the lookout for a new club after being sacked by the League One side . 'It's another negative headline that, for some reason, this club attracts. But it has to be dealt with internally. 'Incidents like we had are disappointing, but they happen. 'The players who have represented the club over the past two years should feel proud. Even in the season when we went into administration, I was proud of everybody's efforts.'","Port Vale's Doug Loft has revealed the damage caused to his face during a training ground bust-up with team-mate Daniel Jones .

"By . Emma Innes . A multiple sclerosis patient who suffered from terrible tremors has been successfully treated - thanks to an implant inserted into his head. Father-of-one Graham Collinson, 43, was plagued by vicious tremors down the right side of his body after developing the neurological condition. They stopped him from carrying out simple everyday tasks such as getting dressed or picking money out of his wallet. Graham Collinson, 43, had surgery to insert electrodes into his brain to control a severe tremor in his right side. The electrodes can be controlled using a portable device (pictured) which turns them on and off . But after undergoing a risky and complicated operation to fit electrodes into his brain, he can enjoy a better standard of life. The operation is a treatment frequently used for Parkinson’s disease patients. Mr Collinson, from Hartlepool, said: ‘I’ve got a quality of life back that I thought I had lost forever. ‘I want to thank the amazing surgeons who have made a world of difference to my life. ‘They’ve given me my quality of life back, the ability to do simple everyday tasks that I thought I would never be able to do again. The device is my own miniature miracle.’ With his condition deteriorating and the tremor down the right side of his body getting worse, Mr Collinson was briefed about the possibility of undergoing the surgery last year. Mr Collinson has multiple sclerosis and he suffered from such bad tremors he struggled even to get dressed . After deliberating over whether to go ahead with the treatment, he decided he had nothing to lose. He underwent deep brain stimulation surgery in September 2013 at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary. The procedure that involves the surgeon implanting leads, which have electrodes at the end, into the brain. The leads are then tunnelled under the skin to a device similar to a pacemaker which is fitted in the chest or stomach area. It is thought that about 25 to 60 per cent of MS patients have a tremor. This is a trembling or shaking movement that the patient cannot control. It is usually a back-and-forth shaking movement but the tremor can also be irregular and unpredictable. It is often described as one of the more difficult symptoms of MS to manage but occupational therapy and drug treatments can help in some cases. The treatment Mr Collinson had is called deep brain stimulation. It involved electrodes being inserted into his brain attached to a device similar to a pacemaker. When the device is switched on, the electrodes send electrical pulses to target the area of the brain that causes the tremor reducing or preventing it. Source: Multiple Sclerosis Society . When switched on, the electrodes send electrical pulses to target the area of the brain which helps to control the tremors. Mr Collinson can now carry out simple everyday tasks that he had been unable to do for the last three years. He said: ‘My tremor hasn’t completely disappeared, obviously, but it’s so much better than it was. I have had to get used to a worsening tremor since my diagnosis. ‘The surgeon told me about this treatment but warned me of the risks. There was a risk of suffering a stroke, a brain bleed or getting an infection in the brain. ‘I put it off for a while but with my tremor getting worse fast I thought I had nothing to lose and said I wanted to go for it. ‘I never had any idea it would improve my quality of life so much. Things like getting dressed, brushing my teeth, fastening zips, getting money out of a wallet. ‘They all seem like such simple everyday tasks but I couldn’t do any of them. Now I can, it’s just made a world of difference. ‘On a morning when I switch it on I can feel it in my head as the power surges through. ‘I can feel a slight electric shock as well. But that’s a small price to pay to get my quality of life back.’ Multiple sclerosis is a condition which affects nerves in the brain and spinal cord causing a range of symptoms including problems with muscle movement, balance and vision. In some cases, it also causes severe tremors. The condition occurs when the protein around each nerve fibre in the brain and spinal cord is damaged. This disrupts the transfer of nerve signals and cause symptoms.","Graham Collinson, 43, had severe tremors down his right side .

"By . Mark Prigg . It has been dubbed 'Tinder for bars'. Mingleton, a new iPhone dating app, allows you to find approach people in the same bar or at the same party. Once users have signed up and created a profile, they can see everyone near them who also has a profile. Scroll down for video . The app shows profiles of everyone in the same room or bar. Users can then ask to 'mingle' with another person, and the pair can see more information about each other if they accept. Mingleton uses a feature called iBeacon found in apple's latest iPhone software. This uses low energy Bluetooth to send messages over short distances, and is usually found in shops or sports stadiums, where it is increasingly being used to send messages and communicate with customers. For instance, in Apple Stores, customers can be automatically told when their Genius Bar appointment is ready to start, or be shown special offers or in which part of the store a particular product is in. The firm's two founders, said the app actually started out as a side project created by the 24-year old Harvard grads, Obi Ekekezie and Joel Ayala. 'It’s an easy, low-key way to break the ice with the people literally around you and find out who wants to meet you,' the pair explain on their web site. 'When we set out to design and create Mingleton in November of 2013, we wanted to create an app that enhanced rather than replaced the way in which we meet new people. 'Though there are a number of social location-based apps and even more online dating sites, we felt there was still significant room for improvement.' The app is designed to let people in the same bar introduces themselves to others virtually to see if they are interested, and has been dubbed 'Tinder for bars' The pair say one key problem was people lying online about their appearance. 'It’s a lot easier to misrepresent your physical appearance online than in person. 'This is why we aimed to design the app in a way that encourages users to first see someone they find interesting in real life and then use the app to find out if that person is also interested in them.' The app allows allows people to meet quickly. 'Having tried our hand at online dating, we definitely understand how disappointing it can be to spend all that time sending messages back and forth only to meet in person and recognize the two of you don’t have chemistry.'","iPhone app uses low energy Bluetooth system .

"By . Sara Malm . Young women who spend a lot of time on Facebook are more likely to have a negative body image, a new study has found. Women in their late teens and early 20s were more likely to compare their own body with that of their friends if they spent more time on social media, and Facebook in particular. Researchers found a connection between increased negative feelings about their appearance and the young women’s Facebook number of hours, something which could lead to eating disorders and depression. Pressure: The more a young woman spends on Facebook, the likelier she is to feel negative about her body, a study has found . The study inquired into how often women of university age in Britain and the U.S. compared their bodies with their peers in relation to Facebook use, diet and exercise habits and body image. Researchers were able to predict how often women felt negatively about their own bodies after looking at someone else’s photos or posts, and how often women compared their own bodies to those of their friends. The more time a young woman spends on Facebook, the likelier she is to have negative feelings associated with her own body and the more she will compare her own to the bodies of friends. The study also found that women who want to lose weight pay more attention to their physical appearance the more time they spend on Facebook. Women who want to lose weight pay more attention to their physical appearance the more time they spend on Facebook . A 2013 survey found that 76 per cent of women want to lose at least 'a few pounds'. Two thirds of respondents used Facebook as their social media of choice and 75 per cent spend at least one hour a day on the platform. Although more than half said other people's Facebook posts about fitness and health inspired them, 22 per cent felt envious and 15 per cent said it made them feel guilty if they aren’t currently sticking to their own diet and fitness routine, according to women’s online magazine SheKnows. Previous studies have examined college or adolescent girls and the effect of Facebook on users’ body image over non-users’. However, this is the first study to link time spent on Facebook to poor body image. Petya Eckler, of the University of Strathclyde, Yusuf Kalyango, of Ohio University; and Ellen Paasch, of the University of Iowa, are due to present their findings at the 64th Annual Conference of the International Communication Association in Seattle. Doctor Eckler said: ‘Public health professionals who work in the area of eating disorders and their prevention now have clear evidence of how social media relates to college women’s body image and eating disorders. ‘While time spent on Facebook had no relation to eating disorders, it did predict worse body image among participants. ‘As experts in the field know, poor body image can gradually lead to developing an unhealthy relationship with food. ‘The attention to physical attributes may be even more dangerous on social media than on traditional media because participants in social media are people we know. 'These comparisons are much more relevant and hit closer to home. 'Yet they may be just as unrealistic as the images we see on traditional media.’","The more time a woman spends on Facebook, the worse her body image .

OK, so it wasn’t quite the tower block being detonated: Barcelona went down fighting, a post's width from equalising in injury time and ultimately only second-best because of Gareth Bale’s brilliance. But the Copa del Rey represented their most realistic chance to win a trophy this season and a trophyless campaign means heads will roll. Gerardo Martino appears to have already decided his time at the club will come to an end at the end of the season.

His side are now out of two competitions and almost out of a third inside seven days. Martino rotated his squad earlier in the season so that they might not tire in the later big games - as they did so disastrously last year against Bayern Munich in the Champions League semi-final - but there is no accounting for Bale. 'It’s incredible to see at that stage of the game someone with the power to make that run and then the composure to finish as he did,' said the Barca coach of his tormentor. If, as expected, Martino goes, two candidates will lead the race to replace him. Borussia Dortmund's Jurgen Klopp appeals to the Barcelona media because of his swashbuckling football and charismatic press conferences. But Athletic Bilabo coach Ernesto Valverde might be a more realistic option and would be many fans' choice. Incredi-Bale!

Valverde will also be a safer bet. As a former player at the Nou Camp he will not look to compromise the 'Barca way' and will not complain if the club can't make any signings this summer - he is in much the same position at Bilbao, who can only sign Basque players. If president Josep Bartomeu comes up with an acceptable candidate to replace Martino then he may save his own skin. But if supporters are unhappy at the prospective new manager then attention will turn to a board still marked by its association to Sandro Rosell, the last president who oversaw the Neymar contract fiasco and failed to satisfy FIFA's demands for Barca to put the status of their Under 18 players in order.

What can't be bought is the happiness and form of Lionel Messi. 'Messing in action' was the most used headline after his no-show in the final.

'After careful consideration, I have concluded that it is not right to ask for your support in 2014, knowing that my focus would be divided between doing my job as attorney general while at the same time running as a candidate for governor,' he said in the statement. 'Therefore, I am announcing today that I will not seek re-election as your attorney general this November.' The announcement by Biden, 45, caught Delaware's political establishment off guard. He was seen as a virtual shoo-in for re-election. 'I don't want to use the word disappointed.

"By . Craig Hope . Follow @@CraigHope01 . David Moyes has now marked 50 games in charge of Manchester United. Sunday's trip to former club Everton will be his 51st at the helm. It is, however, unlikely to be a milestone he will be celebrating. Rather, it may well come as a point of relief that he has survived this far. For it is fair to say his steering job of the champions has proved a rocky ride. Along the way there have been calls for him to go, each of United's 10 defeats triggering forensic analysis of his failings. All smiles: David Moyes will mark his 51st match in charge of Manchester United against his old club Everton . There are sure to be similar inquests between now and the season's end and, once the campaign does reach its conclusion, the question will be asked: Does David Moyes deserve more time? The theory, of course, is that time equates to success. Many would argue that is a somewhat short-sighted stance, for a bad manager would merely worsen the plight of a club given too long to inflicts his ills. But history, in fact, shows that the best managers - those we house in the bracket of 'greatness' - have been afforded time despite unspectacular starts. Indeed, Sportsmail can reveal that, over the first 50 games of their respective tenures, the likes of Sir Alex Ferguson, Arsene Wenger, Bill Shankly and Brian Clough did not fare as well as Moyes. The man in charge: Arsene Wenger oversees Arsenal's match against Leeds at Highbury back in 1996 . In black and white: Sir Alex Ferguson shared an identical start to Arsene Wenger for their first 50 matches . Phone a friend: Brian Clough, posing with son Nigel, and Bill Shankly (right), who managed Liverpool . They did, of course, go on to enjoy silverware-laden stewardships having negotiated what were indifferent beginnings. Ferguson and Wenger share an identical record of 22 victories, 18 draws and 10 defeats. Moyes' return of 27-9-14 is the equivalent of being six points better off (*see below for our method of calculation). This, then, suggests Moyes should be granted the time to reverse fortunes at Old Trafford. In the current era, no manager has enjoyed a more lucrative return from their first 50 games than Jose Mourinho during his initial spell at Chelsea. In 2004, the Portuguese, having arrived from Champions League winners Porto, guided the Blues to Premier League victory. His first half century produced just four defeats and our table has him collecting 118 points from a possible 150. The Special One: Jose Mourinho is unveiled at Stamford Bridge for his first stint as Chelsea manager . Incidentally, our findings show current Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini to be second best to Mourinho's effort a decade ago. Indeed, his predecessor Roberto Mancini earned the equivalent of 20 points less than the current incumbent. Of the managers who have survived testing times before subsequently flourishing, Don Revie is perhaps the best example. He was promoted to the role of player-manager at Leeds United in 1961 with the Elland Road club in the second tier. Of his first 50 matches, 24 were to end in defeat. The board kept faith and, by 1974 and before Revie's exit for England, they had won two league championships, two Inter-Cities Fairs Cups, one FA Cup and one League Cup. Brendan Rodgers is another who endured criticism during the early days of his reign.

"By . Belinda Robinson . Scientists are developing a groundbreaking handheld testing kit to diagnose cancer, HIV and a host of other diseases within minutes. Experts say their pioneering new method of testing patient samples on a small chip plugged into an iPhone will slash costs and waiting times. Researchers at the University of Southampton, Hants, liken the technology to the tricorder used to remotely scan patients in cult classic film Star Trek. Futuristic: Dr Themis Prodromakis (left) from Nano Group, ECS, University of Southampton and Philip King Director, right, of Newbury Electronics Ltd show off the chip . Testers would stand at a patient's bedside, take smaller samples than currently used, and test them for a variety of killer diseases with ease. The first prototypes should be available for initial testing next year under the £1million project. Doctor Themis Prodromakis, from the University's Electronic and Computer Sciences department, said the possibilities were 'exciting'. The test works by using electrical components as chemical sensors to detect reactions between proteins and antibodies, Dr Prodromakis said. After a few minutes, the device would give a 'Yes' or 'No' reading for the relevant virus. Dr Prodromakis said: ‘The current system, which has been in use for 30 years or so, uses antibodies that react with the viruses. Chip: Researchers at the University of Southampton liken the technology to the tricorder used to remotely scan patients in cult classic Star Trek . ‘The equipment is quite bulky and requires a lot of samples from the patient, which causes them a lot of discomfort. ‘It also needs someone to work overnight in a lab to pipette the material into wells and observe any changes. ‘The new method would detect what . you're looking for technically, by using PCBs used in consumer . electronics and computers to automate the process. ‘You'd . plug one of these chips into a device like an iPhone, put the samples . in and have a diagnosis within a few minutes, rather than days or weeks. ‘It's . an incredibly versatile technique that can be used to test many . different things, such as HIV, tuberculosis or various cancers, in any . environment. ‘This is a . very exciting development as it's cheap and mobile and could be used to . diagnose people in third world countries within minutes.’ Chips would cost £50 compared to around £500 under the conventional system, which also monitors proteins, Dr Prodromakis said. Dr Prodromakis has teamed up with Newbury Electronics, a leading manufacturer of PCBs in the UK, on the three year project. Clinical trials will be carried out at the Department of Infection and Immunity at Imperial College Healthcare NHS. The new technology would need less than one microlitre of blood to be taken from the patient. Tricorder: The nifty little tricorder device is pictured here at a Christie's auction of Star Trek studio items from the television series 'The Next Generation' In the fictional Star Trek universe, a tricorder is a multifunction hand-held device used for sensor scanning, data analysis and recording data. Three primary variants of the tricorder are issued in Star Trek's Starfleet. The standard tricorder is a general-purpose device used primarily to scout unfamiliar areas, make detailed examination of living things, and record and review technical data. The medical tricorder is used by doctors to help diagnose diseases and collect bodily information about a patient; the key difference between this and a standard tricorder is a detachable hand-held high-resolution scanner stored in a compartment of the tricorder when not in use. The engineering tricorder is fine-tuned for starship engineering purposes. There are also many other lesser-used varieties of special-use tricorders. The word 'tricorder' is a combination of 'tri-' and 'recorder', referring to its three device input keys, which by default cover GEO (geological), MET (meteorological), and BIO (biological) functions.","Scientists are developing a groundbreaking handheld test that will detect cancer and HIV .

"By . Hayley O'keeffe . A romantic Swiss student who had his smartphone stolen has promised the young woman who ended up with the device that she can keep it, if she agrees to meet up with him. Niklaus Knecht, 24, realised his phone had ended up in the hands of a pretty girl living in Morocco after she started using it as a camera, unaware that the phone's picture upload function was still switched on. The smartphone was stolen in April of this year when he was on a train heading to Zurich in Switzerland and had dozed off, waking up to find that someone had sliced open his jacket pocket. The unknown girl pictured relaxing in a park, Mr Knecht wants to meet up with her, and says she can keep the phone . A Swiss student who had his smart phone stolen has promised the young woman who ended up with the device that she can keep it if she agrees to meet him . He bought a new one and forgot about his old handset, expecting to never see it again until suddenly pictures of the young girl and snaps taken by her started turning up in his dropbox. Some of the pictures are relatively mundane, such as snaps from her student study plan, but others show what could be family members in traditional Moroccan dress. But the photographs that caught Mr Knecht's attention show the girl herself, sometimes lying on a bed, other times showing off new clothes such as a new dress or posing by romantic backdrops such as a waterfall or in a park. The girl is shown relaxing around her home, and cuddling up to a teddy bear with the words 'I love you' on it . In another picture she has a cuddly teddy with the words 'I love you', and others are simply snaps from everyday life smoking a cigarette on the beach or cooking some of her favourite dishes. He said: 'She obviously doesn't realise that all the pictures she is taking are ending up in my dropbox and it's a pretty good general view of an everyday life in Morocco.' He added: 'I am really keen to find out who she is and more about her. I'd like to meet her and am prepared to travel to Morocco to see her. 'I think it would be interesting to find out how she ended up getting the phone, although I'm sure she had nothing to do with the original theft. Close encounter: The girl has taken many photographs, including close-ups such as this one. But will she get close to the phone's original owner? 'I guess she simply bought it from whoever did steal it.' Mr Knecht and his friend Alex Moshovelis have now set up a Facebook site in the hope that the girl will get in touch and they have uploaded some of her snaps. He said: 'I can see that some 13,000 people in Morocco have looked at the Facebook page so I'm fairly confident that somebody will be able to identify her or one of the people from the hundreds of snaps she's uploaded on the phone. 'It would be great to meet her and of course she's welcome to keep the phone. 'I . am just keen to find out a little bit more about how she got the phone . and I think it would be an interesting project as part of my . schoolwork.'

"By . Francesca Chambers . The Obama administration announced today that it will extend indefinitely the review period for the remaining portion of the Keystone pipeline. The State Department did not give an end date for the review process, discouraging proponents of the project who had hoped the government would make its decision in the next few weeks. President Barack Obama previously announced his administration's support for the third phase of the Keystone pipeline earlier this year, but said his administration would put the fourth and final phase through another review process . 'The permit process will conclude once factors that have a significant . impact on determining the national interest of the proposed project have . been evaluated and appropriately reflected in the decision documents,' the department's statement said. 'The Department . will give the agencies sufficient time to submit their views.' State spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a tweet that the department needed more time to review the more than 2.5 million comments it had received. Therefore state was adding more time to the review process but not the public comment period. She also cited an ongoing court case in Nebraska as a reason for the delay. The case, which is under review by the Nebraska Supreme Court, could affect the route of the yet-to-be built  Keystone XL pipeline. Three sections of the Keystone pipeline have already been completed or are under construction. The fourth and final phase of the pipeline, Keystone XL, is awaiting government approval. Phase IV would stretch from Alberta, Canada to Steele City, Nebraska. Two years ago President Obama denied TransCanada Corporation's application to build the pipeline in response to concerns from environmental groups. After the company altered the route, Nebraska Governor Dave Heineman gave the final phase the green light in January 2013. The Obama administration has been slow to do the same, instead opting to put the application through a formal review process that was scheduled to end in May. Route map for the Keystone Pipeline. The dotted blue line represents the proposed Keystone XL route that is now under indefinite review by the Obama administration . Leading opponent of the pipeline, the Natural Resources Defense Council, praised the administration's decision immediately following Friday's announcement. 'Getting this decision right includes . being able to evaluate the yet-to-be determined route through Nebraska and . continuing to listen to the many voices that have raised concerns about . Keystone XL,' the organization said in a statement. Meanwhile, House Speaker John Boehner blasted the delay as a 'refusal to stand up to the extreme left.''This  delay is shameful,' Boehner said in a press release.' This job-creating project has  cleared every environmental hurdle . and overwhelmingly passed the test of  public opinion, yet it’s been . blocked for more than 2,000 days.' Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's statement echoed Boehner's. The pipeline is projected to create thousands of jobs. The exact number is unknown but average ranges are in the thousands. Support for the pipeline is bipartisan. After TransCanada changed it's proposed route for Keystone XL, former President Bill Clinton said the country should 'embrace' the pipeline. After the Obama administration's announcement Friday afternoon, Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp called the delay 'ridiculous.' 'This most recent delay leaves everyone waiting in limbo – federal . agencies, construction and energy workers and companies, state . officials, and Canada.  It hurts all of us when no decisions are made,' she said in a statement. The freshman Senator is part of a group of 11 Democratic senators publicly pressuring the President to make a decision one way or the other by the end of next month. Heitkamp said that given today's news she would be . forced to 'seriously consider other available options for approval.'","The U.S. State Department announced Friday that it was extending the length of the review process.

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . and Ellie Zolfagharifard . Pledge: Every new smartphone sold in America will have a 'kill switch' to prevent it from being used by thieves, phone makers have pledged . Every new smartphone sold in America will have a 'kill switch' to prevent it from being used by thieves, phone makers have pledged. The system, which protects users' personal information and renders phone useless if they are lost or stolen, could become standard by 2015. It has been backed by Apple, Google, Samsung and Microsoft - along with leading mobile device carriers in the U.S.. The companies have signed on to a voluntary programme, called 'Smartphone Anti-Theft Voluntary Commitment, launched by CTIA-The Wireless Association, a trade group for wireless providers. In doing so, they have agreed to provide a free preloaded or downloadable anti-theft tool on all smartphones sold in America after July 2015. Users' options will include . remotely removing a smartphone's data and preventing reactivation if a . phone is stolen or lost, the trade group said. At present, a consumer has to report a stolen smartphone to a carrier and request to have it disabled. They . also have to either install tracking apps or rely on manufacturers to . offer remote-kill features built into their operating systems. But with a 'kill switch' installed, a special text message could be sent to the phone which would render it useless. Surprisingly, the pledge has been backed by law enforcement and elected officials, who have previously warned that putting a permanent 'kill switch' on phones has serious risks, such as the potential for hackers to activate it. However, they are now encouraging . phone markers to implement the system in a bid to combat surging . smartphone thefts across America. Scroll down for video . Theft: The system, which renders phone useless if they are lost or stolen, would become standard by 2015. It has been backed by Apple, Google, Samsung and Microsoft - along with leading cellular carriers in the U.S. Pleased: The companies have signed on to a voluntary programme launched by trade group CTIA-The Wireless Association. CEO Steve Largent (pictured) said he 'appreciated' manufacturers' response to the programme . The . pledge may place pressure on mobile device manufacturers in other . countries - such as Britain, where phone theft is also high - to adopt . the system. In a . statement, CTIA chief executive, Steve Largent, said he 'appreciated' manufacturers' response to the voluntary programme. 'We appreciate the commitment . made by these companies to protect wireless users in the event their . smartphones are lost or stolen,' he said. A ‘kill switch’ is a system for remotely disabling smartphones and wiping their data. All personal information - such as contacts, photos and emails - will be deleted and the phone rendered useless. However, emergency services and pre-programmed emergency numbers will remain accessible under current law. Once . the phone is back in the hands of its rightful owner, its previous . settings and data will be restored ‘to the extent feasible.’ The system will become standard in 2015, according to a pledge backed by most of the mobile world's major players. Currently, . a consumer has to report a stolen smartphone to a carrier and request . to have it disabled. They also have to either install tracking apps or . rely on manufacturers to offer remote-kill features built into their . operating systems. With a kill switch installed, a special text message could be sent to the phone which would render it useless. Some . campaigners are calling for preloaded kill switch software on every . smartphone rather than leaving it up to individual manufacturers and . carriers. However, a major . concern is that a kill switch would be an attractive target to hackers . who could find out the special message and disable a phone remotely. This is a particular risk for people who work in defence or law enforcement agencies, say opponents of the plan. 'This flexibility provides consumers with access to . the best features and apps that fit their unique needs while protecting . their smartphones and the valuable information they contain. 'At the same . time, it's important different technologies are available so that a ""trap door"" isn't created that could be exploited by hackers and . criminals.' Other smartphone makers to have signed the pledge include HTC, Motorola and Nokia - as well as cellular carriers Verizon Wireless, AT&T Inc, U.S. Cellular Corp, Spring Corp and T-Mobile, according to CNN. It comes nearly two weeks after Samsung announced that it had added two anti-theft features, 'Find My Mobile' and 'Reactivation Lock' to its recently released Galaxy S5 smartphone. Apple created a similar 'Activation Lock' feature for the popular iPhone last year and has offered a free tool called 'Find My iPhone'. Almost one in three robberies in the U.S. involve phone theft, according to the Federal Communications Commission. Lost and stolen mobile devices - mostly smartphones - cost consumers more than $30billion in 2012, the agency said in a study. Earlier this month, California legislators introduced a bill that, if passed, would require mobile devices sold in or shipped to the state be equipped with the anti-theft devices, from next year. Similar legislation is being considered in New York, Illinois and Minnesota, and bills have been introduced in both houses of Congress. San Francisco District Attorney, George Gascon, and New York State Attorney, General Eric Schneiderman, have given manufacturers a June deadline to find solutions to curb smartphone theft. They said in a joint statement today CTIA's plan is 'a welcomed step', but still falls short of ending smartphone theft because the measures will rely on consumers to seek out and turn on the technology. 'This approach is a losing strategy, and that's why this commitment falls short of what American wireless consumers need to effectively end the epidemic of smartphone theft,' added Mr Gascon. Security measures: It comes weeks after Samsung announced that it had added two anti-theft features to its Galaxy S5 smartphone (left). Apple created a similar anti-theft feature for the popular iPhone (right) last year . But Jeff Kagan, a longtime tech analyst . in Atlanta, said the wireless industry's commitment may be the closest . to solving the smartphone theft problem. He believes leading manufacturers signed on to the programme because they noticed the U.S. government is in the process of making sweeping changes. 'I'm sure there will be a lot of back and forth, but this is the next natural step,' he said. 'I don't think the wireless industry would've done this if there wasn't pressure from lawmakers and the public to come up with some solutions. Sometimes it takes a nudge.'","System protects users' personal information if phones are lost or stolen .

"By . Liz Hull . Convention has it that women worry most about their bodies. Men, however, are just as concerned, suffering the same lack of confidence about their shape – be it a tomato, brick, snowman or nacho. Hundreds were asked to give details of their figures, allowing researchers to identify seven types among British males. Scroll down for video . Snowman: James Cordon . Brick: Robbie Williams . Cucumber: Freddie Flintoff . String bean: Bradley Wiggins . Nacho: Tom Daley . Pear: Ricky Gervais . Tomato: Eamonn Holmes . PEARA little bit larger around the middle . CUCUMBER  Straight up and down with no extra weight . TOMATO  Slightly chubby all over . BRICK  Broad all over . NACHO  Broad shoulders and slim waistline . STRING BEAN  Very skinny and lean . SNOWMAN  Rounded around the stomach and chest creating a figure of eight like shape . Olympic swimmer Tom Daley's toned . torso shows off the triangular 'nacho', with his broad shoulders and . slim waist. Although the look is popular with women, only 5 per cent of . men thought they lived up to this muscular ideal. The biggest group – 49 per cent – . admitted being a 'pear' like comedian Michael McIntyre, carrying a . little extra round their middle. The most coveted shape was a 'cucumber', the lean figure sported by former England cricket captain Andrew Flintoff. Although 46 per cent wanted this, only 15 per cent managed it. The 'brick' or generally broad all . over figure similar to pop star Robbie Williams applied to 9 per cent of . the 1,500 men quizzed by menswear retailer Jacamo. On the chubby side . were the one in ten who confessed to being a 'tomato' like television . presenter Eamonn Holmes. Professor Brendan Gough, a body image expert at Leeds Metropolitan . University, said that media portrayals of men (left) are making the . average man (right) feel insecure about his looks . Fewer than 5 per cent were at the . extremes of the 'snowman' – with the rounded chest and belly of  Robbie . Coltrane – or the skinny physique of a 'string bean' like cycling . champion Bradley Wiggins. Few of the men surveyed were happy . with their shape, with almost half admitting they needed to lose weight. In fact, almost three-quarters hated their body, proving that it is not . just women who feel self-conscious about their looks. Professor Brendan Gough, a . psychologist at Leeds Metropolitan University, said modern men care much . more about their appearance than previous generations. 'We live in a world where appearance . is very important for guys – in work, relationships and well-being,' he . added. 'Few live up to the  models on magazine covers, but more are . moisturising, tanning and even wearing make-up. When men look good, they . feel good.' The survey found that men felt at . their physical best aged 28. But, as they aged, they lost confidence and . some even suffered depression about the way they looked. Many felt pressure from magazines to . look good but most admitted poor diets and lack of exercise stopped them . having a better body. According to the poll, Prince Harry, 28, probably feels quite confident about his looks . The age at which men feel most confident about their body peaks at 28, according to the same study. Around 40 per cent admit that at this age they have the perfect shape for their age. One in three men said they feel they can wear what they want . at that age, while 41 per cent think they have the perfect weight for . their size. Professor Gough said: . 'Men are changing and so is masculinity. In our younger years, we are . still struggling to find our identity and who we are. 'But when we get into our late twenties and reach 28 we become more comfortable with our bodies and assured about ourselves. 'At that age people are typically starting to get married, have children and establish themselves in their career. 'They become more comfortable in their body and it is the perfect age where you can still get away with eating less sensibility. 'When we get into our 30s our metabolism decreases and start to put on weight.

"By . Liz Hull . When Martha Payne started posting pictures of her miserable school dinners online, she realised it may ruffle a few feathers. But the nine-year-old never expected her blog to spark a full-scale internet revolt after council bureaucrats tried to ban her from telling the truth about her canteen meals. The young campaigner also could not have predicted the blog's huge popularity would generate more than £60,000 in donations to help feed impoverished children around the world. However, angry about the headlines Martha’s ‘NeverSeconds’ blog was generating, officials at Argyll and Bute council ordered teachers to stop her from photographing her dinners and rating them online. Good cause: Martha's blog, Never Seconds, has raised more than £60,000 since she first started it . Victory! Martha Payne, 9, and her father David were all smiles after the council's decision to make a u-turn on banning her food blog . Blog over: Last night Martha posted a goodbye message . In a post headed ‘Goodbye,’ she wrote: ‘This morning in maths I got . taken out of class by my head teacher and taken to her office. ‘I was told that I could not take any more photos of my school dinners.’ But the officials seriously underestimated the youngster’s internet . following and thousands of people, led by celebrity chef Jamie Oliver, . took to Twitter to criticise their decision, leading to a humiliating . U-turn by the council. Within hours of Oliver tweeting to Martha to ‘stay strong’ and urging . his 2.3million followers to re-post his message, the schoolgirl’s blog . became one of the top subjects discussed on the site worldwide. Critics . lined up to accuse the council of ‘bullying’ Martha by trying to . ‘silence her freedom of expression’ and thousands signed a petition to . get them to overturn the ban. Back for more: The council had tried to shut the blog down before a Twitter bakclash forced a U-turn . Supporters inundated council phonelines with complaints and also pledged . thousands of pounds to the Third World children’s charity linked to . Martha’s blog, smashing her £7,000 target. Donations, from supporters all over the world, including Canada, Germany, America, New Zealand and Australia, now stand at £61,519.07. The decision also angered Scottish Education Secretary Mike Russell, whose intervention forced the council to perform a U-turn. Council leader Roddy McCuish announced they would be withdrawing the ban . with immediate effect. He said: ‘It’s a good thing to do, to change . your mind, and I’ve certainly done that.’ Last night Martha’s father, Dave Payne, 39, said common sense had . prevailed. ‘Martha is beaming,’ he said. ‘She came home from school with . a big smile on her face. ‘She is delighted she can carry on blogging, but more so about the money . being raised for the charity. People have been very, very generous. The . way the world reacted to the ban is very revealing, it’s just fantastic . that common sense has prevailed.’ Food for thought: Martha posted this picture on an internet blog and began to add daily snaps of her lunches, rating and commenting on them . Grim grub:  Martha's photos of her school dinner has turned her into an overnight internet sensation . Martha's miserable school dinners look set to spark an outcry over nutrition for the nation's children . The saga began seven weeks ago when Martha, with permission from . teachers at Lochgilphead Primary School, started taking pictures of her . £2 school dinners and commenting on them as part of a writing project. Because Martha’s home is on the west coast of Scotland, however, . standards for school meals differ and widespread improvements in the . rest of Britain appear not to have been applied. Her first post included a photo of a measly slice of pizza and a lonely . potato croquette, alongside a sprinkling of sweetcorn, a cupcake for . dessert and a lot of empty space. Alongside the photo, the schoolgirl wrote: ‘The pizza in the first pic . was alright but I’d have enjoyed more than one croquette. I’m a growing . kid and I need to concentrate all afternoon and I can’t do it on one . croquette. Do any of you think you could?’ Beside a photograph of a limp looking cheeseburger, two potato croquets, . a few rings of cucumber and a rocket ice lolly, Martha wrote: ‘Today’s . meal was on the menu as Cheeseburger and ice cream/biscuit but as you . can see I got an ice lolly. I prefer ice cream. I wish they had stuck to . the menu.’ Over the next two months her daily snaps gathered an impressive . following, with more than two million people throughout the world . logging on and sending in their own pictures for her site. After seeing the photographs, Oliver, a veteran school food campaigner, . sent a tweet to her father, which read: ‘Shocking but inspirational . blog. Keep going. Big love from Jamie x.’ Martha later posted that the celebrity chef had sent her a copy of his . Jamie’s Great Britain cookbook in which he wrote: ‘Dear Martha, great . work!!! Clever girl. Lots of love. Jamie O. XXX Keep it up!!’ But on Thursday, Martha, whose mother is a GP, revealed that teachers . wanted her to stop taking the photographs. The council said the decision . was made after an article published in a tabloid newspaper, under the . headline ‘Time to fire the dinner ladies’, left some members of staff at . the school in tears. In an ill-judged 500-plus word statement, they accused Martha’s blog of . being ‘misleading’ and attacked her father for refusing to put an end to . it. Mr Payne, who runs a smallholding, correctly predicted the move was an . ‘own goal’ which would serve only to generate more criticism because . ‘the pictures tell the story about how good the food is’. Last night the Argyll-based Mary’s Meals, the charity supported by . Martha’s blog, revealed she had raised enough to build several kitchens . for starving children in Malawi. The charity said: ‘Martha’s support for Mary’s Meals has been amazing . and we are extremely grateful for everything that she has done to help . us reach some of the hungriest children in the world.’ Internet hit: Martha's fearless exposé of daily fare at her (unnamed) school prompted global discussion about shockingly unhealthy food being served .

"By . Sara Malm . A Michigan elected who was censored after using the word 'vagina' in an abortion debate performed controversial play Vagina Monologues on the steps of the state Capitol in Lansing last night. Lisa Brown and ten other female . legislators read the play where the word is featured over 100 times alongside the play's author, Eve Ensler in front of an estimated 2,500 people. What started as a personal protest against Ms Brown's one-day gagging order turned into a rally for women's rights and freedom of speech. Brown was silenced during a heated debate of a proposed bill restricting abortions. She said: 'Mr. Speaker, I’m flattered that you’re all so interested in my vagina, but ""no"" means ""no.""' Scroll down for videos . Lisa Brown, right, before the performance. Brown was put on a one-day speaking ban after using the word 'vagina' in an argument against an anti-abortion bill .

Lisa Brown, center, reads her par alongside ten other lawmakers and several actresses on the Michigan Statehouse steps . She was banned from speaking on an unrelated bill on Thursday for 'violating the decorum of the House'. The headcount for the reading was 2,500-attended . the reading which turned into a mass rally with attendees sporting . signs saying: ‘Get your mitts of my bitts [sic]’ and ‘Can’t say it? Don’t legislate it!’ The crowd chanted 'Vagina! Vagina! Vagina!' before Ms Brown came on stage with the other performers. 'Vagina is not a dirty word,' Brown, 45, told ABC News prior to the performance, before adding that it was about 'empowering' people to recognise that. Lisa Brown and #sayvagina was trending on Twitter over the weekend and the issue is still hotly debated on social networks with the event already being referred to as 'Vaginagate'. The crowd of both men and women turned the performance into a rally for women's rights and freedom of speech which went viral and was trending on Twitter as #sayvagina .

Barb Byrum, was also barred from speaking last Thursday because she referred to vasectomies during the debate. She told the crowd she was 'overwhelmed by the worldwide attention. Before the play began, Ensler joined Brown and Byrum on the Capitol steps and called for an apology from the Republicans who barred them from speaking. 'These women stood for our rights,' Ensler said to applause. 'The vaginas are out. We are here to stay.' During a heated debate on Wednesday . Ms Brown, who is Jewish, spoke against a proposed bill which would . further regulate abortions. Banned: Lisa Brown, D-West Bloomfield, was told that she was not allowed participate in Thursday's debate on an unrelated bill because of her comments on during Wednesday's abortion debate . ‘Wherever there’s a question of the . life of the mother, or that of the unborn child, Jewish law rules in . favour of preserving the life of the mother,' she said. 'The status of the fetus as human life does not equal that of the mother. I have not asked you to adapt and adhere to my religious beliefs. Why are you asking me to adapt to yours?’ But . what caused the most controversy were the closing words to Brown’s . speech. ‘And finally, Mr Speaker,’ she said. ‘I'm flattered that you're . all so interested in my vagina, but no means no.’ Some representatives applauded her impassioned statement but others did not take too kindly to her bold words. 'What she said was offensive,' state Rep. Mike Callton, R-Nashville, told the Detroit News. 'It was so offensive, I don't even want to say it in front of women.

'As a woman and mother, I was personally offended by Rep. Lisa Brown's . disgraceful actions during Wednesday's floor debate, she said. Majority Floor Leader Jim Stamas, . R-Midland, said the decision to bar Brown from speaking was not her . reference to the female anatomy, but her conduct. 'My concern was the decorum of the House, not of anything she said,' Stamas told the newspaper. 'I ask all members to maintain a decorum of the House, and I felt it went too far yesterday.' But . Ms Brown defended her decision to use the 'v-word'. 'If I can't say the . word vagina, why are we legislating vaginas?' Brown said during a . Capitol press conference. 'What language should I use? We're all adults . here.' During the same . debate, Democratic representative Barb Byrum tried to introduce an . amendment that would regulate vasectomies but was not allowed to speak. She protested and was declared 'out of order'. 'There . were actions by Representative Byrum on the floor involving shouting in . the chamber that also failed to maintain decorum,' House Speaker . spokesman Ari Adler told CBS. But . Ms Byrum disagreed. 'It's my impression that I'm being banned from . speaking as a result of my use of the term vasectomy - a medical . procedure,' she told the Huffington Post. 'Neither . of us has been contacted by Republican leadership as to why or how long . we've been banned.

"By . James Rush . Graphic photographs taken during the liberation of Denmark after five years of Nazi rule show how gangs of men rounded up and abused conspirators and women accused of sleeping with Germans. The black and white images, taken after British paratroopers swept into the Scandinavian country in 1945, illustrate the anger and hatred the Danes felt towards the German occupiers. In one shocking series of images, a woman who is believed to have . slept with a German is chased down and stripped before having swastikas . painted over her. In other images, which are only now coming to light as they go up for auction, men are taken away at gunpoint while another image shows a baying mob rip and burn a Nazi swastika flag. In a shocking series of images, taken following the liberation of Denmark in 1945, a woman who had slept with a German is chased down by a group of men . The men grab hold of the woman as she tries to escape . The brutal images depict the woman as she is pinned down on a bench by the group . The woman is then stripped of her clothes before the men paint swastikas on to her . The woman is understood to have been attacked by the group of men for sleeping with a German . Written beside some of the pictures of men being taken away is the Danish word 'stikker' which translates to 'mole'. The album also includes shots of a car riddled with bullet holes and a blood-soaked passenger seat . Another photo meanwhile depicts a celebratory scene of a truck carrying dozens of British paratroopers being cheered through the streets of Copenhagen. The album, which gives a stark insight into anger felt in the aftermath of the war, is now coming up for sale at C&T Auctioneers of Rochester, Kent. Unlike other countries under German occupation, the Danish government remained in power and the country continued to function relatively normally after leaders opted to cooperate with the Nazi regime. But, increasingly provoked by German soldiers' brutality, resistance groups started to build momentum prompting mass strikes and demonstrations across the country. When the Danish government refused to prohibit public meetings and impose curfews on its people in response to the action, German authorities dissolved the government and took military control of the country in 1943. Later that year, Danish citizens discovered German troops were planning to round up Danish Jews and take them to concentration camps. Many more Danes joined the resistance which then stepped up its acts of sabotage and hostile attacks against the Nazis. Photographs which depict men being taken away at gunpoint following the 1945 liberation of Denmark are now to go up for auction . Written beside some of the pictures is the Danish word 'stikker' which translates to 'mole' The pictures appear to show suspected conspirators being rounded up and taken away at gunpoint . A baying mob rip and burn a Nazi swastika flag during the liberation of Denmark in 1945 . They managed to help the majority of Jews flee the country to neutral Sweden with only 600 out of . 6,000 Danish Jews being sent to concentration camps. It was only then that the clandestine 'Danish Freedom Council' was created and gradually unified the various resistance groups. Danish . citizens who collaborated with the Nazis were despised by their fellow . countrymen who suffered brutal conditions under a tougher stance by the . German occupiers for the last two years of the war. The resistance started to publish an . underground newspaper called 'Land and People' and in June 1944 the . whole of Copenhagen went on strike. This . resulted in a huge backlash from German troops who cut off water . supplies and electricity. Within a month, 23 Danes had been killed. But the Danish resistance refused to give in and continued to organised strikes and acts of sabotage. When Berlin finally succumbed to advancing Allied forces in May 1945, Germany abandoned Denmark altogether. Some . 900 Danish . civilians and 850 resistance fighters were killed during the war and a further . 4,000 Danish volunteers died fighting in the German army on the Eastern . Front. Within days of troops leaving, 'traitors' were rounded up and 40,000 people were arrested on suspicion of collaboration. Of . these, 13,500 were punished. In this image a car can be seen riddled with bullet holes . Another image of the car shows the blood-soaked passenger seat . The album also includes this celebratory scene of a truck carrying dozens of British paratroopers being cheered through the streets of Copenhagen . Such was the hatred of those who sided . with the Nazis that capital punishment, which had been abolished in . Denmark in 1930, was reinstated between 1945 and 1950 in order to . execute 46 Nazi collaborators. The album, that contains 112 photographs, shows how come angry citizens decided to take the law into their own hands if they weren't satisfied with the official punishment given. Collaborators were attacked in the street, and ostracized from society. The album has a pre-sale estimate of Â£850 and is due to be auctioned on April 30. Matthew Tredwen, of C&T . Auctioneers, said: 'This is a scarce and historically interesting . photograph album showing the liberation of Denmark. 'It has some very graphic photographs of how the Danes dealt with conspirators in 1945. 'They . are snapshot size photographs of scenes in the streets of Denmark with a . British army general and the return on the Danish King Christian. 'Eight . photographs show a woman being attacked by a group of Danish men, who . strip her and paint her with swastikas, obviously she was accused of . being a conspirator. 'There . are photos of Nazi flags being destroyed in the streets and men being . led away under guard from Danish resistance fighters. 'The album has come from a private collector after it turned up for sale at an exhibition in Germany many years ago.' Denmark was invaded by German troops on April 9, 1940, but the Danish government was allowed to remain in power after promising to cooperate with the Nazis. This meant that Denmark functioned relatively normally for the first two years of World War II - giving citizens little incentive to resist their occupiers in comparison to other countries in Europe. But, increasingly provoked by German soldiers' brutality, a resistance started to build momentum prompting mass strikes and demonstrations across the country. When the Danish government refused to prohibit public meetings and impose curfews on its people in response to the action, German authorities dissolved the government and took military control of the country in 1943. Denmark reintroduced Capital Punishment in order to deal with Danish citizens who collaborated with the Nazis. Surrendering German soldiers pictured loading their arms on to lorry at Copenghagen barracks in 1945 . Suddenly, Danish citizens found themselves at the hands of a much more brutal regime, and the resistance increased. Later that year, resistance members learned that the Nazis intended to round up Danish Jews and send them to concentration camps. Resistance members managed to smuggle thousands of Jews to safety in Sweden, resulting in just 600 of 6000 danish Jews being sent to the camps. It was only then that the clandestine 'Danish Freedom Council' was created and gradually unified the various resistance groups. Danish citizens who collaborated with the Nazis were despised by their fellow countrymen who were suffering brutal conditions under a tougher stance by the German occupiers for the last two years of the war. When Berlin finally succumbed to advancing Allied forces in May 1945, Germany abandoned Denmark altogether. Within days of troops leaving, corroborators were rounded up and 40,000 people were arrested on suspicion of collaboration. Of these, 13,500 were punished. Just three weeks after the end of the war capital punishment, which had been abolished in Denmark in 1930, was reinstated between 1945 and 1950 in order to execute 46 Nazi collaborators.","Black and white images were taken during liberation of Denmark in 1945 .

"By . Darren Boyle . A cow and a bull have been married off in a lavish Indian wedding - costing £10,000. More than 5,000 villagers turned up to watch sacred cow Ganga and Prakash get hitched during the Hindu ceremony held near Indore in Madya Pradesh. The nuptials were organised by Ganga's guardian, Gopal Patwari, to save the state's harvest from a 'natural disaster'. Scroll down for video . 'I Moo': Ganga the cow (left) is married to Prakash the bull during a lavish Hindu wedding ceremony in Indore, India . More than 5,000 people turned up to see the happy couple married during the unusual ceremony in Indore, India . Prakash the bull arrived at his wedding on board a specially decorated bugee; the wedding had all of the traditional rituals associated with a Hindu wedding . According to Mr Patwari: 'Natural calamities like hailstorms and heavy rain occurred in nearby areas, destroying their crops,' he said. 'To prevent this from happening to our villages we organised this wedding on the advice of Sadhus and holy men. 'We have been told this will maintain peace in our village.' Organisers arranged a chef and DJ to ensure that the 5,000 onlookers enjoyed the wedding of Ganga to Prakash . Ganga was specially prepared for her wedding to Prakash with a specially designed outfit . A marching band with drummers led villagers towards the unconventional wedding ceremony . The Hindu Sadhu who performed the unique wedding between Ganga the cow and Prakash the bull . Most are farmers growing wheat, barley, beans and cotton and so heavily depend on a good harvest to survive. So it was no surprise when more than 5,000 arrived in droves on Monday, April 14, to witness the no-expense-spared wedding - and few left disappointed. Ganga, who is considered sacred in the Hindu religion, arrived early dressed in a red custom-made bridal saree, jewels, dyes and a garland. Prakash looked equally stunning as he arrived in a decorated bugee and draped in a multicoloured sherwani and orange turban. The ceremony started with Mr Patwari giving Ganga away before a Sadhu performed all the traditional rituals. This included Haldi, Ganesh Pooja, Mandap and Fera - where the couple are led around a sacred fire to affirm the marriage. Mr Patwari looked overjoyed as they were finally announced a couple, sparking hours of feasting and dancing to a DJ. He said: 'I am happy. People around me are happy. Everyone is happy.' But like every couple, Ganga and Prakash will have to work at their marriage and they are expected to be faithful and start a family. Mr Patwari, who was one of 25 co-organisers, added: 'From here on we hope Ganga and Prakash lead a happy life together, just like a normal man and wife. 'They will go on and have children who will be happy and prosperous. 'We expect Hindus of our village not to forget our holy cow and remember their religion. The next generations especially should not forget. We want more weddings like this to take place in the future.' The wedding took two months to organise and cost Rs 1million (about £10,000) - half the cost of the average British wedding. Invitations were sent to 10,000 residents of three closely connected villages, encouraging them to donate what they could spare. The special wedding had all the traditional rituals of a Hindu wedding including Haldi, Ganesh Pooja, Mandap and Fera. Organisers hope that the nuptials will bring good luck to the farmers who paid £10,000 towards the ceremony after neigbouring regions were hit with monster hailstones and heavy rain.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Two Chinese men caught stealing dogs to sell to restaurants were savagely beaten by a vigilante mob after they stole four pets while in a southern village. The two men are accused of several pet dog thefts in and around Guilin City in southern China's Guangxi Autonomous Region, which they would sell as meat to cafes and eateries. However, when the pair was caught red-handed by one angry villager, it did not take long before a large crowd were attacking them with bricks and bats, beating them bloody. Caught: The two dog-thieves were caught in action by a pet-owner in a village in southern China who called out to his neighbors who attacked the men . Dog's dinner: The men were known in the area for drugging and stealing pet dogs and selling them on to restaurants . Revenge: One angry villager attacks the two thieves' car in Sanjiang Village, Guangxi . Guilin City police said the pair would drive into small villages with their windows open, listening for barking dogs. When they came across a decent sized animal, they would throw meat laced with a sedative into the yard, and then return half an hour later, after the drugged meat had been eaten. They would then free the dog, and hit it over the head to kill it before throwing the body in the back of the car. But after loading their fourth animal after striking in Sanjiang Village they were spotted by a dog owner who was just returning home and saw them dragging his pet to the car. The man alerted his neighbours who rushed out and joined in forming an angry, violent mob. Witnesses: A large crowd gathered to see justice served by the hands of the people in the small Chinese village . Rule of the mob: The crowd was so angry they refused to hand over the men to the police, but kept beating them in the street . Evil acts: The two men were dragged out of the car by the angry mob, and found to have several drugged and dead dogs in their vehicle . The men: The thieves, pictured with the dogs they had drugged and were planning on selling on, were not released until their families turned up and paid off the owners of the kidnapped dogs . The mob used large bricks to destroy their car, injuring one of the men in the process. The pair was dragged out of the car, feelings running so high that even when police arrived, the villagers refused to hand over their victims. Instead, they continued to parade through the streets and demanded a guarantee that they would get at least Â£500 in compensation for the dead animals. In the end, the stand-off was resolved when the families of the two badly beaten men turned up and offered their apologies, and gave a promise to pay the compensation as requested. Dog meat has been used for human consumption in China for centuries, where it is thought to have medicinal properties, and is especially popular in winter months where it is thought to generate heat and keep the body warm. Dog meat is especially popular in Guangdong and Guangxi where there are even dog meat festivals every year.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"By . Snejana Farberov . A member of the U.S. 'Miracle on Ice' hockey team that scored a tremendous upset victory over the Soviets during the 1980 Winter Olympics is selling his gold medal. Mark Pavelich was one of 20 players who made the final roster of Team USA largely made up of inexperienced college students, who were called upon to face off against USSR's finest players. Against overwhelming odds, the ragtag team of American skaters triumphed over their heavily favored opponents and went on to win the gold in their final match against Finland. Piece of history: Mark Pavelich, a member of the U.S. 'Miracle on Ice' hockey team, is selling his 1980 Lake Placid Olympiad medal through Heritage Auctions . Band of misfits: Pavelich was one of 20 players on the largely inexperienced Team USA who pulled off a shocking win over the Soviets in Lake Placid . Beginning April 25, sports fans and history buffs alike will have a chance to buy Pavelich’s historic medal, which is being sold through the Dallas-based auction house Heritage Auctions. Bidding ends May 16. Heritages sports director Chirrs Ivy told the Minneapolis Star Tribune that the auctioneers were contacted by Pavelich a year-and-a-half ago asking them to put a value on his medal. In 2010, his teammate Mark Wells sold his own Olympic gold for $310,700 - up more than $200,000 from the opening bid of $100,000. In Pavelich’s case, the bidding will start at $62,500, but Ivy told the paper that he believes the lot will fetch a minimum of $250,000. The auctioneer said Pavelich, 56, is not struggling financially, but he would like to sell the medal to help his children with their college tuition and establish a trust. Masterpiece: All the medals for the Winter Games were crafted by Tiffany & Co . High hopes: The medal, which comes with its original presentation box (pictured) and a letter of provenance, is expected to fetch a minimum of $250,000 at auction . The medals for the Lake Placid Olympics were crafted by Tiffany & Co. Each gold disc hanging off a blue-and-white ribbon features a raised torch framed between the words 'XIII Olympic Winter Games' and the Olympic rings. On the reverse there is a conifer branch opposite the text 'Lake Placid 1980.' Below, engraved lettering says 'Ice Hockey, Mark Pavelich.' The original presentational case is included. The auction winner also will receive a ‘letter of provenance’ from Pavelich. Pavelich rates among the most recognizable figures from Lake Placid, earning two assists in the victory over the Soviets, including Mike Eruzione's game-winning goal. American heroes: Members of the 1980 Gold medal winning US Olympic hockey team at the Roxy Roller Disco in NYC, (L-R) Mark Wells, Mark Pavelich, Steve Christoff, Bob Suter, head coach Herb Brooks, Rob McClanahan & William 'Buzz' Schneider . Private citizen: After successfully playing for the New York Rangers and retiring from hockey in the early 1990s, Pavelich built himself a career in land development; he plans to use the proceeds from the auction to help his children financially and start a trust . He would go on to set a still-standing record for points as a rookie for the New York Rangers, and is ranked number 83 in John Wiley & Sons' volume ‘100 Ranger Greats.’ In 1999, Sports Illustrated named the ‘Miracle on Ice’ the Top Sports Moment of the 20th Century. Pavelich was among nine members of the University of Minnesota hockey team who went to Lake Placid under the command of their coach, Herb Brooks, played by Kurt Russell in the 2004 hit film 'Miracle.'

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated  Press Reporter . Almost 50 Russian diplomats and members of their families have been charged in a massive health care fraud scheme, officials announced Thursday. Federal officials allege that 58 of the 63 births to Russian officials living in New York between 2004 and 2013 were fraudulently paid for by Medicare at a cost of roughly $1.5million to US taxpayers. The Russians were applying for these benefits while emptying their pockets at famed stores such as Bloomingdale’s, Jimmy Choo’s, Prada and Tiffany & Co, officials said. Scroll down for video . Pressing charges: United States Attorney Preet Bharara (L) speaks next to FBI's Assistant Director in Charge for New York George Venizelos at an unrelated press conference earlier this year . The fraudsters carried out the plan by applying for a range of benefits, including Medicare, by falsifying information on applications including income levels and citizenship status of children, officials said. ‘Being a diplomat does not give you the right to commit health care fraud,’ FBI special agent in charge of the New York field office George Venizelos said during a Thursday news conference detailing the allegations. The diplomats and their spouses were able to exploit a loop hole allowing them to apply for benefits without proving US citizenship because the child is presumed to acquire US citizenship at birth. Diplomats, their spouses and their children are not generally entitled to Medicare benefits except in cases of emergency, officials noted. ‘As the complaint alleges, the scam exploited a weakness in the Medicaid system, and the charges expose shameful and systemic corruption among Russian diplomats in New York,’ Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said. By under reporting income by thousands of dollars per month, having income statements verified by various official offices and even claiming spouses were brothers, expectant Russian mothers wed to diplomats were able to carry out the fraud. Lying to city and state claims processors provided them with Medicare benefits for prenatal care, birth and young children – which they were not entitled to receive. ‘Diplomacy should be about extending hands, not picking pockets in the host country,’ Mr Barara added. Center of the scheme: The fraud originated out of the Russian Consulate in New York (pictured above) Two diplomats falsely stated they were brother and sister instead of spouses, entitling them to more than $21,000 in benefits. Three others provided documents showing their children were American citizens when in fact they were Russian nationals living in New York. The defendants received hundreds of thousands of dollars in Medicare income while spending tens of thousands on cruises, watches, shows, jewelry and other luxuries. ‘The pattern of spending by the Russian diplomats and their spouses, including the defendants, is generally inconsistent with the grossly underreported incomes claimed on the Medicaid applications,’ the criminal complaint said. The fraud was pervasive at all levels of Russia’s diplomatic mission in New York, officials said. Tens of thousands: Diplomats dropped thousands at Bloomingdale's, Prada and the Apple Store while receiving benefits . Timor Salomatin, a former diplomat at the Mission, and his wife, Nailya Babaeva applied for benefits stating Mr Salomatin’s income to be $3,000 a month at the same time he applied for a credit card saying his income was more than $8,000 a month. The couple received more than $30,000 in benefits during a period they spent over $50,000 on purchases including in excess of $8,400 at the Apple Store and $10,000 each at several retailers including Bloomingdale’s and Prada. Their documents were signed off on by Mikhail Korneev – falsely confirming an underreporting of the couple’s income. Andrey Artasov and Nataliya Artasova reported their income to be almost half of what it actually was, they also received Medicare benefits while hoarding tens of thousands of dollars in good from Apple and Swarovsky. Shopping spree: The diplomats and their wives spent tens of thousands at Tiffany's while receiving benefits . ‘All sorts of lavish spending was going on,’ Mr Barara lamented. Russian officials didn’t take the announcement lightly, saying through state news agency ITAR-Tass that ‘Russophobic forces’ are conspiring to spoil Russia-US relations. The complaint asks for the Russian government to arrest and hand over all 49 officials accused in the fraud – 11 are currently in the US, the rest have returned to Russia. Diplomats have immunity from criminal prosecution, which will likely shield them from ever having to answer the charges. ‘All of these defendants have diplomatic immunity due to the nature of their work for the Russian government,’ said Mr Barara. US officials can ask for that immunity to be revoked, but Russian officials don’t appear to take the charges seriously enough to comply.","Almost 50 diplomats and family members took part in the scam .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The family of the Boston bombing suspects has received more than $100,000 in welfare benefits over the last decade, according to the Boston Herald. Details of the benefits - which included cash, food stamps and housing assistance - are contained within more than 500 documents that were handed over from Massachusetts welfare officials to a committee of state lawmakers on Monday. The documents have not been released publicly, but a person who has reviewed them told the Herald that the 'breadth of the benefits the family was receiving was stunning.' In need: Katherine Russell Tsarnaev, left on April 20 in Cambridge, and her husband, right in 2009, began receiving welfare shortly after the birth of their daughter . Example: The suspects' parents Zubeidat, left, and Anzor, right both at a news conference on Thursday in Dagestan, Russia, also received federal and state welfare benefits when they lived in the U.S. The Herald also spoke to . Massachusetts Rep. David Linsky about the documents, who promised a . thorough review of the assistance that the family received. 'I can assure members of the public . that this committee will actively review every single piece of . information we can find because clearly the public has a substantial . right to know what benefits, if any, this family or individuals accused . of some horrific crimes were receiving,' said Linsky, the committeeâ€™s . chairman. It has been previously reported that deceased Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his wife Katherine relied on food stamps and public assistance from 2011 to 2012, soon after they became parents. Last Friday, the Massachusetts Department of Transitional Assistance detailed how the couple received food stamps from September 2011 to November 2012. The couple, who married in June 2010, are believed to have become parents to their daughter, Zahara, in 2011, in the months before they began receiving the aid. First born: Tamerlan and Katherine's daughter Zahara, pictured this week with her grandmother Judith Russell in Rhode Island, is believed to have been born in 2011 . In addition to food stamps, the young . family also benefited from TAFDC (Transitional Aid to Families with . Dependent Children), a program for low income parents with dependent . children. TAFDC is paid out twice a month and can be directly deposited into a recipient's bank account. The assistance was paid to Katherine, since a person must be a U.S. citizen, or eligible non-citizen, to receive the aid. Food Stamps: . Oct. 2002 to Nov. 2004: Tsarnaev parents (Anzor and Zubeidat) received food stamps . Aug. 2009 to Dec. 2011: Tsarnaev parents (Anzor and Zubeidat) received food stamps . Sep. 2011 to Nov. 2012: Katherine Russell Tsarnaev received food stamps . Transitional Aid to Families with Dependent Children program (TAFDC): . Jan. 2003 to March 2003: Tsarnaev parents (Anzor and Zubeidat) collected TAFDC money . Aug. 2009 to June 2010: Tsarnaev parents (Anzor and Zubeidat) collected TAFDC money . Sept. 2011 to Nov. 2012: Katherine Russell Tsarnaev collected TAFDC money . While . the couple took the government aid, the 24-year-old Rhode Island native . would sometimes clock as many as 80 hours a week while . her unemployed husband stayed at home. Ultimately his wife's income made the couple ineligible for welfare and they stopped receiving state money in November 2012. Welfare officials have been forced to . divulge details of the aid that was paid out to the family of the . bombing suspects. Mass. Gov. Patrick Deval told state agencies last week that they should not discuss the details of what . government assistance Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev had received, citing privacy concerns. Welfare information is not . available for public release unless the person in question provides their . consent, but it is available to lawmakers. Massachusetts State . Rep. David Linsky called on the state's Department of Transitional Assistance to provide him with the information. Linksy issued an ultimatum on Thursday to welfare officials, . giving them 24 hours to provide the information. The letter from Rep. Linsky was provided to the Boston Herald. 'My office is working to fully comply with your request,'  DTA interim commissioner Stacey Monahan wrote in his report to Rep. Linsky, saying they were only providing a summary 'given the great interest in this matter.' In addition to the aid paid out to Tamerlan and his wife, both alleged bombers had benefited from welfare since their parents Anzor and Zubeidat Tsarnaev collected foodstamps and TAFDC - from 2002 to 2004 and again in 2009 to 2011. Breadwinner: Lawyers for Katherine Russell (pictured in high school yearbook photos) said the 24-year-old mother worked tirelessly as a home healthcare aid to support her young family. Her husband was unemployed . Since the . Tsarnaevs are Chechen immigrants, some wondered why they received aid. But the state agency explained that they were considered eligible for . the public assistance. 'The Tsarnaev parents were eligible to . receive benefits as legal, non-citizen residents who were granted asylum . status and met the basic eligibility criteria for DTA, including . household income levels, presence of dependent children and other . factors,' the DTA interim commissioner Stacey Monahan said in a letter . addressed to David Linsky, Chairman of the House Post Audit and . Oversight Committee. The Herald had reported that sources who knew Tamerlan said that though he sported a flashy appearance, he failed to earn very . much money for his family and was essentially a stay-at-home dad. His younger brother, on the other hand, has been described as more entrepreneurial. Family: Zubeidat Tsarnaev, center with Tamerlan, and the child's father, Anzor, left, received state aid multiple times from 2002 to 2011 (pictured with an uncle Muhamad Suleimanov (right) in an undated photo) Dzhokhar, who was a sophomore at . University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, attended the school on a . scholarship and earned petty cash selling marijuana, sources told the . Boston Globe. Investigators are scrutinizing the . brothers' source of income, as they probe whether the pair received . outside assistance for their attack, either from a radical group or . foreign government. Security experts have noted though . that the modus operandi was relatively cheap, estimating that the . materials for each of the pressure cooker bombs used at the Boston .

"By . Will Stewart . Secret services fugitive Edward Snowden claimed on Sunday that US government officials 'want to kill me' in an interview with a German TV channel. The intelligence leaker's Moscow lawyer had already voiced similar fears after controversial comments from unattributed sources. Snowden - currently hiding from US justice in Russia, where he is believed to be under the protection of the The Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) - said he has received threats on his life. 'These people, and they are government officials, have said they would love to put a bullet in my head or poison me when I come out of the supermarket, and then watch as I die in the shower,' he said. Still hiding: Edward Snowden, 30, has revealed he has received threats against his life in the wake of his intelligence leaking scandal . The translated Snowden quotes were issued by German public television netowork ARD with the promise of further comments from the renegade intelligence contractor. The interview was broadcast in Moscow in secret. Snowden's concerns follow a BuzzFeed article entitled 'American Spies Want Edward Snowden Dead', which cited an alleged Pentagon official. 'I would love to put a bullet in his head,' said the source, who was not named. A current analyst for the National Security Agency - where Snowden used to work - was quoted as saying he would not hesitate in murder Snowden. 'In a world where I would not be restricted from killing an American, I personally would go and kill him myself,' they said. US President Barack Obama speaks about the . National Security Agency (NSA) and intelligence agencies surveillance . techniques in the US, reacting to leaks by former N.S.A contractor . Edward Snowden . In the speech Obama said more could be done to . protect the civil liberties of his citizens, and also pledged to end . spying on friendly heads of state . And an unnamed army source suggested Snowden could be 'poked' on his way back from a supermarket and administered with poison. Snowden 'thinks nothing of it at the time and starts to feel a little woozy,'  he said. 'And the next thing you know he dies in the shower.' The fugitive's Russian lawyer said last week that additional security maybe needed for Snowden after the 'threats'. Snowden, 30, is wanted on treason charges after leaking highly classified details about the US - and the British - snooping on mobile phones and the internet. The American in recent days has ruled out a return to his homeland, despite a campaign to allow him back. In danger: Snowden took refuge in Moscow to . evade treason charges after disclosing U.S. state secrets on NSA . intelligence gathering, and now fears for his life and wants to increase . security . A man uses his cell phone to read updates about former U.S. spy agency contractor Edward Snowden answering users' questions on Twitter on January 23, 2014 . The 30-year-old said that while returning to the US would be the 'best resolution' for everyone, doing so is impossible because he believes there is 'no chance' of a fair trial. Snowden is barely seen in Moscow and officials have said since his arrival last summer that he is in danger from a possible hit by US agents. He received temporary asylum in Russia in August - a move that infuriated the United States and was a key factor behind President Barack Obama's decision to cancel a summit with Russia's Vladimir Putin last year.","In a new interview with a German TV channel, Edward Snowden reveals that threats have been made against his life .

"By . Jaymi Mccann . Lovestruck: Peter Backus found his other half just two years after figuring out he only had a one in 285,000 chance of doing so . It is tough out there for anyone looking for love, but now the man who figured out there are only 26 potential partners for him is about to get married. It has been revealed that researcher Peter Backus, from London, eventually found his other half and will tie the knot this weekend. In 2010 Backus figured out that there were only 26 women in the United Kingdom that would fit his age, educational and physical preferences. The then University of Warwick professor had spent three years without a girlfriend, and described the study as just a funny little thing. But, despite the odds, he found his fiance Rose who ticked all the boxes. He told TODAY: ‘When you work out the numbers, they're not unreasonable, that's the reality people face. It might feel surprising, but most people work out the equation. ‘I met [Rose] at a dinner with some friends in London. It was just a chance meeting, just a friend of a friend.’ In 2010 Backus hit the headlines when he published a paper titled “Why I don’t have a girlfriend’, which used the Drake equation to calculate how many potential partners there were out there. The equation was created by astronomer Frank Drake in 1961 to estimate the number of alien civilisations that exist in our galaxy, the Milky Way. Backus then used the equation to figure out that there are only 26 potential partners for him, which gave him a 0.00034 per cent chance of meeting one of them on a night out in London. Tie the knot: Backus will marry Londoner Rose at a ceremony this weekend . But, Backus found his soulmate, and says that people should remain hopeful, despite the odds. He said: ‘Keep looking, and spend a lot of time hanging out in places where other people who satisfy your criteria hang out. That's what the equation shows.’ The baffling Drake equation reads: N = R* x Fp x Ne x Fi x Fc x L, and helped pioneering scientist Professor Drake to predict that there could be 10,000 civilisations in our galaxy. Chances were slim: Backus calculated that on an average night out in London there would be a 0.00034 per cent chance of finding an appropriate partner . Backus simply replaced the original . equation with his own criteria for a dream date, which included the . percentage of women likely to find him attractive. He said at the time: ‘The research may sound depressing to people looking for love, but the good news for singles is, it's probably not your fault!’ Backus’s paper has become legendary, attracting extensive media attention and even warranting a mention on hit TV show The Big Bang Theory.","Peter Backus calculated that there were only 26 women for him in the UK .

"By . Snejana Farberov . A coroner in Ohio has found that the . father of a boy killed in a 2012 school shooting died of an accidental . heroin overdose on the second anniversary of his son's death. The . Geauga County coroner confirmed Friday that 48-year-old Russell King . Sr. succumbed to the combined effects of heroin and alcohol. A family . member found King dead at his home in Aquilla Village just after 5am on the morning of February 27. Russell King Sr., 48, was found dead at his home on the second anniversary of the Chardon High School shooting in Ohio in which his son Russell Jr., 17, was killed . At his sentencing last March, Lane wore a T-shirt with 'killer' scrawled across it and cursed and gestured obscenely at relatives of victims in the courtroom . King's . 17-year-old son, Russell King Jr., was one of three students killed in . the February 2012 shooting at Chardon High School east of Cleveland. Three other students were wounded in the shooting inside the school's . cafeteria. Gunman T.J. Lane, 19, pleaded guilty to the shooting rampage and is serving three life sentences. ‘Whatever transpired, there's no question Russell King is another victim of this tragic shooting two years ago today,’ Craig Bashein, an attorney who represents the family in a wrongful death lawsuit, said after the father's death. Lane opened fire in the school's cafeteria with a .22-Ruger before classes began. He also killed Daniel Parmertor, 16, and Demetrius Hewlin, 16. Russell was 17. Three other students were wounded, including Nick Walczak, Nate Mueller and Joy Rickers. Tears of grief: Crystal King, sister of slain student Russell King Jr, addressed the court at Lane's sentencing . Heartbroken: Crystal King, pictured left and right, first lost her younger brother, Russell, and then their father . 'What happened took an enormous toll on all the families,' said Geauga County Prosecutor James Flaiz, who worked with the youths' families for several months during Lane's criminal case. 'It hit Mr. King as hard or harder than the others. He was extremely close to his son. Seeing the emotional pain on him concerned me.' Attorneys for families of the victims, including King Sr., and some of those who were wounded have filed a personal injury lawsuit against the Chardon School District, some of its administrators and the alternative school that the shooter attended. Rude: Lane had flipped the middle finger and used profane language toward those in the packed courtroom, including the victims' families . Prosecutors say T.J. Lane, who was waiting for a bus to the alternative school, took a .22-caliber pistol and a knife to the high school and fired 10 shots at a group of students inside the cafeteria on February 27, 2012. At his sentencing last March, he wore a T-shirt with ‘killer’ scrawled across it and cursed and gestured obscenely at relatives of victims in the courtroom. Investigators said he admitted to the shooting but said he didn't know why he did it. Grieving community: The February 2012 shooting rampage at Chardon High School left three boys dead and three other students injured . Russell King Sr. went to all of the court hearings involving Lane. He is survived by his wife, Jeannie, and their older daughter, Crystal. A year ago, families of the three slain students filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against the teenage gunman and his family. The suit alleged negligent supervision by Lane's parents and grandparents.","Russell King Sr., 48, was found dead at his home February 27 on the second anniversary of Chardon High School shooting in Ohio .

"By . Jason Groves . Union Baron: Unite's leader Len McCluskey . The Unite union is offering to teach unemployed Romanians and Bulgarians how to claim benefits in Britain. The organisation, Labour’s biggest donor, is courting foreigners from the two countries as part of a membership drive. It offers the advice as a reward for signing up to the union. It has even issued membership forms in Romanian and Bulgarian, despite the Government – and Labour – saying immigrants should learn English. The unemployed are offered the chance to join the union for just 50p a week. In return, Unite says it will offer new arrivals with advice on how to maximise benefit claims. The decision to target Romanians and Bulgarians is sure to be controversial, given public concern about the lifting of immigration controls on the two new EU countries at the end of this month. Ministers have refused to estimate how many immigrants will arrive from the two impoverished countries – but some experts believe it could run to hundreds of thousands in the coming years. Tory MP Priti Patel called Unite’s behaviour shameless, adding: ‘It is incredibly irresponsible and I’m afraid it just sums up the attitude of Labour and the trade unions towards EU immigration. ‘Labour is the party that opened the floodgates to EU immigration with its open borders policy. Now their allies in the union movement are basically encouraging people to come here, and offering them advice on how to exploit our benefits system when they arrive. It gives the lie to the idea that Labour is finally getting serious about immigration.’ In recent years Unite, led by Len McCluskey, has directly targeted immigrant workers in a bid to swell its membership – and coffers. The UK borders will be flung open this year as Romanians and Bulgarians will have access to the job market . In 2011 its political officer Clare Moody met with Alexandru Petrescu and Ciprian Bolos, the UK representatives of Romania’s Social Democratic Party, in a bid to urge migrant workers to join the British union. The union now issues its membership forms in a range of foreign languages, including those of countries whose workers do not have an automatic right to work in this country, such as Ukraine, Turkey and China. A union representative at Unite’s London office explained to Romanian national Diana Petrescu in a phone conversation that, after signing up as a member for just 50p per week, she would receive help in finding work, housing and how to claim benefits: . Diana Petrescu: ‘I am from Romania and I have just moved to London three weeks ago. I do not have a job and am looking for help to settle in and find a job. Can I join the union? UNITE official Karen: ‘Yes, everyone is welcome.’ DP: ‘Can you help me settle into the country? KAREN: ‘You can send your CV, the officials can look at it and help you to find a job. We also offer a service that shows what benefits you are entitled to.’ The forms include details of its controversial ‘community’ branch, which is aimed at the unemployed. The organisation was launched last year to ‘provide a way people can find and use their political voice’. Membership costs 50p a week, and includes a free ‘welfare benefits check-up... which makes sure you’re claiming the right benefits’. Members are also offered free  personal injury advice to pursue compensation claims. Tory MP Aidan Burley said: ‘[Unite] would rather swell their membership coffers by encouraging new immigrants to claim the maximum amount of benefits, than represent their members – many of whom will be concerned about their own jobs being taken by these migrant workers. ‘Rather than helping Romanians and Bulgarians claim more benefits, Unite should concentrate on reforming its own working practices to ensure British firms can stay competitive and jobs remain with the best British workers.’ A Unite spokesman stressed that migrant workers are ‘all too often exploited by unscrupulous bosses, sometimes with tragic consequences’, citing the Morecambe Bay tragedy in which 23 Chinese cockle-pickers drowned. ‘Unite members, no matter what their nationality, can access and be signposted to advice on a whole host of issues,’ they added. ‘Are the Tories seriously accusing Unite and the likes of Citizens Advice of encouraging an influx of migrant workers because we signpost them to advice to stop them being exploited?’","The Unite union is Labour's biggest donor .

"By . Mark Duell . A paedophile who downloaded child pornography so horrific that a judge could not even bear to watch the evidence tapes has been allowed to walk free from court. Andrew Townsend, 51, of Hulme, Manchester, downloaded hundreds of vile photographs but was allowed to walk free after the judge ruled he would not learn his lesson behind bars. Judge Lindsey Kushner, who looked at a sample of the 1,400 images before sentencing him, said she could not bear to watch all the contents of one of the videos featuring extremely graphic content. Avoided jail: Andrew Townsend (left), 51, of Hulme, Manchester, downloaded hundreds of vile photographs but was allowed to walk free after Judge Lindsey Kushner (right) ruled he would not learn his lesson behind bars . Townsend admitted 11 counts of downloading and sharing the pictures and videos after police raided his home in April last year. The judge said that what he did was not a victimless crime. Judge Kusher told him: ‘You must be aware the subjects of these images are not indifferent to what is happening to you. The public must be made aware of just how infectious this material is.’ But the judge, sitting at Manchester Crown Court, rejected the option of sending Townsend to prison and instead gave him a three-year community order. The court was told the rigorous programme, supervised by specialist probation officers, would not be available to him if he went to prison. Judge Kushner said: ‘I’m not doing this because I’m frightened of sending someone to prison. 'This is a successful programme with proven results. It is not to get people through the system quicker or to save money.’ Community order: Townsend (left and right) admitted 11 counts of downloading and sharing the pictures and videos after police raided his home in April last year. The judge said that what he did was not a victimless crime . Sentencing: Townsend was given a three-year community order at Manchester Crown Court (pictured) The court was told Townsend co-operated immediately with police when they seized computers, telling them where to find the images. Judge Kushner described Townsend, who . works in a bank, as a ‘quiet little man’ leading a humdrum life. He was . diagnosed with HIV in 2001, and after a period of depression became more . reclusive. 'I’m not doing this because I’m frightened of sending someone to prison' Judge Lindsey Kushner . He began downloading relatively mild child porn and then progressed to hardcore images, sharing them with other people. His defence lawyer said Townsend was relieved when he was caught and was genuinely ashamed. The court was told the likely 12 months he would spend in prison would mean he would not be able to get the help he needed to stop him re-offending. Townsend was banned from unsupervised contact with under-16s and restrictions were placed on his use of the internet and computers. Paedophile: Matthew Thain, of south-east London, breached the terms of his suspended sentence . A renowned gymnastics coach who abused students as young as six over 40 years avoided jail for a second time last month. Robert 'Bob' Bellew, 66, of New Cross, south-east London, admitted attacking girls at schools and gyms across the country, but was given a 15-month suspended prison sentence in April after a judge said he had shown remorse.

"By . Rosie Taylor . Paedophile: Karl Curtis, aka Robert Oliver, breached an order banning him from having children in his home . One of Britain's most notorious paedophiles was jailed again today for inviting children into his home. Robert Oliver, 58, was part of a gang led by Sidney Cooke which raped and killed a teenage boy in 1985. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison for his part in the killing of 14-year-old Jason Swift but was released in 1997 after serving just eight years. Oliver, who has changed his name to Karl Curtis, was arrested again last month for breaching a court order banning him from letting children into his home. Families living on the same street in Maidstone, Kent, had unwittingly befriended the paedophile and let their children visit the bungalow he shared with his male partner. But one father became suspicious and after searching online he discovered Oliver's history. Kent Police were called and he was arrested on June 7 for breaching a Sexual Offences Prevention Order imposed two years ago. He pleaded guilty to two breaches of the order on June 12 and was remanded in custody at HMP Elmley on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent. He admitted a further two charges when he appeared before Maidstone Crown Court today where he was jailed for three years by Judge Michael Carroll. Release: Oliver, pictured leaving prison in 1997, previously served eight years of a 15-year sentence for his part in the rape and murder of Uason Swift, 14 . Driven out: Oliver moved away from Somerset after angry local people started protests outside his home . Two of the offences were committed on June 4, one on June 6 and another on May 15 this year. On . one occasion Oliver gave a birthday card to a child, while another time . he allowed a boy whose mother was visiting him to use the toilet in his . bungalow. Evil: Fairground worker Sidney Cooke was jailed for killing the teenage boy during a homosexual orgy . The offences on June 4 related to two children knocking on his door as their mother was inside his home having a cup of tea. Detective Constable Victoria Rixon, from Kent Police, said: 'Karl Curtis has a long offending history and is therefore a registered sex offender, and is also subject to a sex offender prevention order. 'We rigorously enforce these orders and within 24 hours of receiving information suggesting Curtis had breached his order he was arrested and has remained in prison ever since. 'He will now serve three years in prison, and when he is released will face the same close monitoring.' Oliver was part of a gang called the Dirty Dozen who drugged and raped boys at orgies in the 1980s. They are feared to have taken the lives of up to 25 youngsters. Oliver is thought to have been living in Kent for more than five years after being driven out of former home in Somerset by an angry crowd.","Robert Oliver, 58, spent eight years in prison after the 1985 killing .

"By . Louise Boyle . Mark Zuckerberg is now believed to be the richest person under 30 in U.S. history after his personal wealth rocketed by $3.2billion in just one day on the back of Facebook. It has been ten years since the 29-year-old founded the social network in his Harvard dorm room and despite accumulating an unimaginable fortune from his invention, Zuckerberg maintains the altruistic belief that the site is a 'service for the world'. Facebook's stock closed at an all-time high on Thursday after shares rose as much as 17 per cent to $62.50. The hike took Zuckerberg's own fortune to an estimated $32billion. When asked about his company's phenomenal success this week, Zuckerberg put it down to the fact that he, and his employees, simply 'cared more'. Scroll down for video . Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg gave an interview on the 10-year anniversary of Facebook where he described it as a 'service for the world' In an interview with the Today show's Savannah Guthrie, due to air in full on Tuesday, Zuckerberg said: 'At the time I thought, ''You know, . someone needs to build a service like this for the world.''...But I just never thought that we'd be the ones to help do it.' He said he remembered clearly sharing the first version of the website with his college friends while they ate pizza. Zuckerberg's personal wealth now stands at around $32billion after ten busy years. However it's not always been smooth sailing - in 2004, Zuckerberg faced lawsuits from fellow Harvard students the Winklevoss twins and Divya Narendra who claimed he had stolen their ideas. Zuckerberg settled with them for 1.2million in shares (which equated to $300million at the company's IPO in 2012). The network's social impact is undeniable -  the company ended 2013 with $1.23 billion users and has changed the way that the world interacts. In 2010, a movie The Social Network told the Facebook story. Facebook stock took a massive jump on Thursday, growing Zuckerberg's personal wealth by $3.2billion .

"By . David Mccormack . A shocking new video illustrates how race and color continue to play a major role in how someone is perceived in American society. The video, shot in Los Angeles, compares the general public’s reaction to first a white male, then a black male, attempting to break into a car. The social experiment was the idea of Jason Roberts, who hosts the YouTube channel Simple Misfits. Scroll down for video . Jason Roberts, left, who hosts the YouTube channel Simple Misfits and his friend Quentin Brunson, right, carried out a social experience to film the different reactions to them breaking into a car . First Roberts attempts to break into the car, but after 30 minutes no one has approached him . He recently took to the streets of L.A. along with his friend Quentin Brunson and filmed the predictable - yet depressing - results. First Roberts, who is white, attempts to break into the car with a wire hanger. Despite the car’s alarm blaring, no one pays him any attention and at one point the police even drive past without stopping to confront him. After 30 minutes, Roberts gives up and then we see the radically different reaction when Brunson, who is black, takes up the challenge. Instantly passers-by are suspicious and a group of men standing nearby start to take pictures on a phone. At one point a cop car drives past, as Roberts brazenly tries to break into a car and its alarm is sounding loudly . Within two minutes, the LAPD arrive – possibly alerted by the passers-by – and Brunson is instantly greeted with a harsh attitude and an order to put his hands up. ‘Let me see your f**king hands,’ orders one cop. ‘Get up against the wall.’ Brunson is quickly surrounded by at least five officers and placed in handcuffs. That’s where the shocking video ends, although in reality Roberts quickly stepped in and explained to the police what was happening. Critics might complain that the video is staged, but Roberts says it was inspired by being involved in  similar double standards situation in real-life. When Brunson attempts to break into the car he receives a different reaction and immediately passers-by are suspicious of him . As Brunson attempts to break into the car, some men standing nearby shoot him dirty looks and one starts to take photos on their phone . He had locked himself out of his car and called the AAA to help him get back into it. The mechanic who arrived was black and Roberts was immediately aware that when he started working the car door, strangers started staring while they had simply ignored his own attempts. According to Roberts, the goal of the video is to raise awareness of how people are treated differently depending on their color. In fact, FBI statistics show that 64 percent of motor vehicle theft was carried out by whites in 2011, while black perpetrators were responsible for 33.9 percent. The video was posted online just days after Michael Dunn, a white man who fired on a group of black teenagers in Florida, killing one, was convicted on three attempted murder counts but escaped his most serious charge of first-degree murder. Dunn's verdict has revived conversations about how white and black Americans face markedly different levels of suspicion and hostility in many situations. Within two minutes of Brunson approached the car, the LAPD has arrived and he is ordered to step away from the vehicle . Brunson is quickly surrounded by police officers and placed in handcuffs . Critics might complain that the video is staged, but Roberts says it was inspired by being involved in  similar double standards situation in real-life .","Jason Roberts, who is white, spent 30 minutes trying to break into a car and no-one approached him .

"By . Louise Boyle . The parents of a school official who went to the police over individuals who were stealing money from the district to buy methamphetamine have demanded that the FBI open an investigation into his suicide. Alex Heitman, the school district’s supervisor of business services, reported the thefts to the Oak Ridge Police Department in Tennessee in April 2011. Three months later in July, Mr Heitman, 29, was reported missing by his elementary school teacher wife Kristie, who was eight months' pregnant at the time. Alex Heitman, a school district business services supervisor, reported  to police that people were passing fraudulent checks to buy meth. A few months later he was dead. His death was ruled a suicide . He . was found dead on July 25 from a gunshot wound to the head in a rural . part of Cocke County, 70 miles from his home. Two of Mr Heitman's own . guns were found at the scene. The death of Mr Heitman, who was also pursuing a doctorate degree, was ruled a suicide. His parents, Don and Annette Heitman, remain extremely dubious that their son took his own life. Mr Heitman, who is originally from Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin, had bachelors and masters degrees from the University of Wisconsin, and an accounting certificate from the University of California-Berkley. The St Louis Cardinals fan had worked for the American Cancer Society and UNICEF before taking a job with the Oak Ridge School District. He married Kristie Kasperski, a teacher, on June 28, 2008 in Waunakee, Wisconsin. Oak Ridge police chief James Akagi refused to confirm Mr Heitman's original complaints of theft today . Mr and Mrs Heitman told Tennessee Watchdog that other than an autopsy report they have received no information from Cocke Country Sheriff's Department to support that their son committed suicide - no ballistics report,  coroner’s report, medical examiner’s report or undoctored crime scene photos. The Heitmans were also initially told by a Cocke County Sheriff’s detective that their son's death did not seem consistent with suicide. The Heitmans have now formally requested that the FBI investigate their son's death. An anonymous source in the FBI’s mail room in Washington, D.C. told Tennessee Watchdog on Wednesday that a letter had been received from the family requesting an investigation. MailOnline was awaiting a request for comment from the FBI field office in Knoxville, Tennessee. The contents of the letter is also published on the family's website. Oak Ridge Police Department's Chief of Police James T. Akagi told MailOnline today that Mr Heitman had been reported to his department as a missing person in 2011. He refused to comment on whether Mr Heitman had filed reports with the police department, saying he was not familiar with the case. MailOnline has requested Mr Heitman's police reports in the school district from the county clerk. Cocke County Sheriff's Department did not respond to a request for comment at the time of publication. No one was available for comment at the district attorney's office on Thursday. Seven people were prosecuted . in relation to Mr Heitman's reports. Five pleaded guilty and were . jailed, another suspect's charges were waived to the grand jury. The . seventh suspect was not indicted. At the time of his death, Oak Ridge superintendent Tom Bailey told Oakridger.com that his death was a 'terrible loss'.  Mr Bailey added that he was 'passionate about his work... intelligent and committed'. Mr Heitman was responsible for business services in Oak Ridge School District.

"By . Jessica Jerreat . Convicted: Nicholas Elizondo served six years in prison for sexually abusing a child under the age of 14 . The mother of a six-year-old girl fears for her daughter's safety after an Oklahoma judge awarded sole custody of the child to her convicted pedophile father. Nicholas Elizondo served six years in jail after being convicted of lewd or lascivious acts with a child under 14 years of age. The girl's mother, Lisa Knight, who divorced Elizondo when she was pregnant, claims her father had shown little interest in Sarah until she reached the age of his victim. Despite having lived all her life in Norman, Oklahoma, a judge ruled that Sarah should live with the 55-year-old convicted sex offender in Bakersfield, California. 'I don't understand how a sex offender . can just walk in the courtroom and just take her after I’ve had her for . six years,' Ms Knight said. 'I just know that his victim was six years old at the time and Sarah is six years old right now,'  she told KforTV. To add to her concerns, Ms Knight claimed that when Sarah returned from a recent visit with her father, she told her . mother 'something really bad happened in the bathtub'. The family allege that Sarah told them her half brother had touched her inappropriately. Ms Knight, and her cousin Jodi Coomer are now fighting to keep her half brother away from Sarah when she moves to California. Custody battle: A court has ordered Sarah Knight to live with her convicted sex offender father in California . Appeal: Lisa Knight says she will fight to get her child back as soon as she has enough money . 'I’ve been fighting him and I just don`t have any more money to fight him at all,' Ms Knight said. She thinks the judge questioned her . parenting when she was unable to name all of Sarah’s doctors. The six-year-old, who has a cleft lip and palette, sees a lot of . specialists. 'There is no . threat to her whatsoever here. Nothing`s happened to her. She`s made all . of her appointments,' Ms Coomer said. 'Because mom can`t remember the . doctor`s names then she`s a bad mom? I don`t think so.' After the couple divorced in 2008, Ms Knight was given custody of Sarah. At first her father was given supervised visits, and later unsupervised visits, to see his daughter. Taken away: Sarah's mother is concerned about her daughter living with Elizondo and his son . In court documents, Elizondo said he filed for custody after Ms Knight stopped allowing him to see his daughter. The convicted sex offender told KLewTV that he took a plea bargain in 1995 when faced with 11 felony charges. In return for pleading no contest to one charge, the others were dropped. But Elizondo says he is not guilty. 'It never happened,' he said, referring to the charge he was jailed for. His victim also denied that was she molested, when she appeared at a court hearing about visitation rights. Kern County Assistant District Attorney Scott Spielman added: 'There isn't anything prohibiting a judge from giving a person convicted of that once they've done their time and they're off probation or parole.' Broken home: Lisa Knight left her husband when she was pregnant and says Sarah has little contact with him . 'There is a lot to be taken into account, but you'd think that there would be a great deal of weight given to a person that actually was charged and convicted and went to prison for molesting a child under 14,' he added. Ms Coomer pointed out that because Elizondo is a registered sex offender, he will be unable to carry out many parental duties, such as dropping Sarah off at school. 'He can`t take her to Chuck E. Cheese. He can`t take her to a park,' she said. 'He can`t go to her school. He`s not allowed in school.' Ms Knight has vowed to fight to regain custody of Sarah as soon as she can afford the legal costs.","Mother terrified for child's safety after shock ruling .

"By . SIMON JONES . Bayern Munich are keen on Manchester United starlet Adnan Januzaj. The European and Bundesliga champions face United at Old Trafford tomorrow in the Champions League quarter-final, first leg and have been monitoring the impact made by 19-year-old Januzaj since he broke into the first team last summer. Paris St Germain made an offer for Januzaj early in the season which was rejected by United and they will maintain that stance should any other club attempt to lure away their brightest young star. VIDEO Scroll down to see videos of the transfer targets, including Januzaj and Dzeko . Raid: Bayern Munich believe they can tempt Manchester United's young star Adnan Januzaj to Bavaria . Bright young thing: Januzaj is highly regarded by United and they will be determined not to let him go at any cost . The Belgium-born midfielder signed a five-year contract at United in October as David Moyes underlined his belief that Januzaj is pivotal to his plans for a new era. Bayern, who remain keen on a summer deal for Chelsea defender David Luiz, are scouting across the world for versatile attacking players who can succeed the likes of Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery, who have both turned 30. They have yet to make an offer for Januzaj but their interest is strong. Getting ready: Januzaj could feature in United's Champions League quarter-final with Bayern over the next week . Summer target: Bayern also have Chelsea's David Luiz on their shortlist . Equally, United will not entertain bids as they look to show that, despite this season’s dramatic dip in results, they still have the power to hold onto their young stars and attract new ones. The loss of Paul Pogba is still a sore point and the club want to ensure that scenario is not repeated. Meanwhile, Ajax are among the clubs showing an interest in Manchester United right-back Marnick Vermijl. The 22-year-old Belgian is on loan at Dutch side NEC. EVERTON JOIN QUEUE OF CLUBS INTERESTED IN FIRMINO . Everton are maintaining an interest in Hoffenheim midfielder Roberto Firmino despite the Brazilian agreeing a new contract. Scouts watched the 22-year-old score in Saturday’s 3-3 draw with Bayern Munich and the playmaker again impressed with his all-round performance. Interest: Everton are one of a number of clubs looking at Hoffenheim midfielder Roberto Firmino (left) On target: Firmino (right) celebrates after earning Hoffenheim a shock 3-3 draw at Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich on Saturday . He has been watched by Inter Milan, Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester United and City this season and last week agreed a two-year extension to a contract that was due to run out in 2015. He is valued at around £12million but Firmino has yet to be capped by Brazil and is yet to secure an EU passport, that could cause a problem for any subsequent work permit hearing. Champions League contenders Everton are drawing up a list of targets as they look to strengthen in attack, midfield and at centre-back for next season. BELGIAN STARLET FAES WATCHED BY MAN UNITED AND CHELSEA . Wout Faes, remember the name. The 15-year-old Belgium defender was watched closely by scouts from Chelsea and Manchester United last week as he played for Belgium U17s in the European U17 Championships in Scotland. The spring-haired teenager, who has drawn comparisons to Chelsea’s David Luiz in appearance, turns 16 on Thursday and is another product of Anderlecht’s youth system. Conveyor belt: Young Belgian talent Wout Faes (left) is being watched by Manchester United and Chelsea scouts . His style and ability on the ball has got clubs discussing figures already and Anderlecht will be holding out for around £2million in compensation. Another Anderlecht starlet Ismail Azzaoui is expected to complete a deal with Tottenham despite late interest from Liverpool in the 16-year-old winger. SWANSEA AND NORWICH IN CHASE FOR POWELL . Swansea and Norwich want to sign Manchester United midfielder Nick Powell in a permanent deal this summer. Wigan are also keen to take the 20-year-old should they gain promotion after Powell scored his 12th goal of the season at the weekend. However, manager David Moyes would prefer for Powell to go out on loan again for another season and this time to a Premier League club so the teams in contention may yet get their wish but only on a temporary basis. Permanence: Nick Powell could be snapped up by Swansea or Norwich when his loan spell at Wigan ends . DZEKO COULD LEAD REVAMPED INTER NEXT SEASON . Manchester City striker Edin Dzeko is emerging as the preferred option for Inter Milan ahead of Chelsea’s Fernando Torres. Dzeko has scored 22 goals in 44 games for club and country this season and Inter are keen for him to spearhead their revamped squad for next season. They have been keen on the 28-year-old for some time and his form has only cemented their view that he could be the man to help them challenge Juventus, Roma and Napoli. Revamp: Manchester City's Edin Dzeko could lead Inter Milan's forward line next season . No rush: City will be reluctant to let the Bosnian front man leave until they have found a replacement . City, however, are not in any rush to sell unless they find a suitable replacement. They would want close to £18m as they look to balance out any improvements of their own in the summer with a defensive midfielder and centre-back among their own priorities. Dzeko is understood to be on less wages than Torres but that fee will be the sticking point for Inter as they look to add a top striker and five other signings. LEEDS SQUAD COULD GO FOR NOTHING . There will be a lot of interest focused on Massimo Cellino’s appeal hearing today as he fights to buy Leeds United. Cellino was disqualified as a potential owner by the Football League last week after being found guilty in an Italian court of failing to pay €388,500 of import tax on a yacht. The Italian businessman had agreed in February to buy 75 per cent of Leeds from the Bahrain-based investment bank Gulf Finance House. In court: Massimo Cellino will attend an appeal hearing on Monday after the Football League disqualified him as a potential owner of Leeds United over unpaid taxes on a yacht . Representatives from the law firm Mishcon de Reya are to argue that Cellino is innocent under Italian law until an appeal against the import tax ruling is finalised. Leeds playing staff received only 50 percent of their wages last week as the club struggled to cover debts without Cellino’s cash. Should the financial situation deteriorate then Leeds will be wary of not being able to pay the players wages which is reputed to total around £18million a year. If players go 14 days without any payment at all those players are able to leave on free transfers as happened at Rangers.","European Champions believe they can tempt United's brightest young star .

"By . Helen Pow . and Ashley Collman . The family of an Ohio death row inmate executed with a never-before-used drug cocktail are suing the medical manufacturer, saying his death was cruel and unusual punishment. Dennis McGuire was put to death on January 16 using a two-drug combination after the state's previous execution drug dried up. He was sentenced to death for the 1989 rape and fatal stabbing of 22-year-old Joy Stewart in Preble County, Ohio. It took 26 minutes for McGuire to die, breaking the record for longest execution since the state resumed capital punishment in 1999. During the nearly half-hour it took McGuire to die, he was observed 'snorting, gurgling and arching his back'. 'It looked and sounded as though he was suffocating,' the lawsuit filed in federal court Friday reads. Scroll down for video . Execution: Death row inmate Dennis McGuire, pictured, became the first prisoner executed in the U.S. by the two-drug combination. His family are now suing, saying he was 'tortured' during the execution . Experimental: McGuire was executed at this facility by Ohio's untested execution method . Punishment: The death chamber at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville. Ohio used intravenous doses of two drugs, midazolam, a sedative, and hydromorphone, a painkiller, to put McGuire to death . Ohio has begun using lethal doses of the sedative midazolam and the painkiller hydropmorphone after the European manufacturer of the previous drug, pentobarbital, stopped allowing its use in lethal injections. Marketed in English-speaking countries and Mexico under the trade names Dormicum, Hypnovel, and Versed, midazolam is a short-acting sedative in the benzodiazepine class of drugs developed by Hoffmann-La Roche in the 1970s. The drug is used for treatment of acute seizures, moderate to severe insomnia, and for inducing sedation and amnesia before medical procedures. It possesses profoundly potent anxiolytic, amnestic, hypnotic, anticonvulsant, skeletal muscle relaxant, and sedative properties. Hydromorphone is a very potent centrally acting analgesic drug of the opioid class. It is a derivative of morphine. An expert in Dennis McGuire's case claimed the two drugs together in lethal doses would very likely cause what's known as 'air hunger' or simply an acute shortness of breath. The clinical definition of air hunger or dyspnea is an uncomfortable awareness of one's breathing effort. It is a normal symptom of heavy exertion but becomes pathological if it occurs in unexpected situations. Reports from McGuire's death chamber suggest this may have in fact occurred. As such, the appropriateness of the drugs, and the extent to which they may be cruel, will likely be reviewed by Ohio officials before they are used in another execution. The family is aiming their lawsuit at Hospira, Inc. - the Lake Forest, Illinois company that makes the drugs midazolam and hydromorphone. On their own, the drugs are actually meant to calm patients during surgery and reduce pain. But together, the McGuire family's lawyers say they cause 'air hunger' which is the acute shortness of breath. The family claims that the company knew what the drugs were being used for but continued to provide them to the state, knowing they 'would cause unnecessary and extreme pain and suffering during the execution process'. Another separate lawsuit was filed on Thursday in an attempt to stop the scheduled March execution of another Ohio killer who would be administered the same drugs. Gregory Lott is scheduled to be executed on March 19 for setting an East Cleveland man on fire and leaving him to die. Lott's attorneys say the state is using the drugs illegally since they don't have a prescription to use them. Hospira provided Ohio with its previous execution drug - sodium thiopental - but stopped producing it after it couldn't guarantee to Italian authorities where their factory was located or that the drug wouldn't be used for capital punishment. According to a company statement, Hospira has prohibited their drugs from being used in executions in the past and will do the same for the midazolam/hydromorphone combination. It's still unclear what McGuire felt as he slipped away. An anesthesiologist hired by McGuire's attorney say the drugs cause 'air hunger' which causes the recipient to duffer 'agony and terror' as they slowly suffocate. But another anesthesiologist countered that opinion, saying that while the inmate might snore, the drugs cause no suffering. The drugs weren't designed to cause death, Jon Paul Rion, the McGuire family attorney, told the AP Friday. 'There's a clear distinction between a therapeutic use of a drug in a medical environment as opposed to using that drug in an execution style,' he said. 'That's the concern, that we're taking drugs that have therapeutic value and we're not using them for the purposes for which the FDA approved nor for which the clinical tests were performed,' he added. Victim: McGuire, 53, was sentenced to die for the 1989 rape and fatal stabbing of Joy Stewart in Preble County in western Ohio. The 22-year-old Stewart was newly married and pregnant . The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a last-minute request to delay McGuire's execution on the grounds that a jury never got to hear the full extent of his chaotic and abusive childhood. The court's denial included no explanation. McGuire was sentenced to die for raping and killing Joy Stewart, 22, in 1989. Stewart's slaying went unsolved for 10 months until McGuire, jailed on an unrelated assault and hoping to improve his legal situation, told investigators he had information about the woman's February 12, 1989, death. His attempts to blame the crime on his brother-in-law quickly unraveled and soon he was accused of being Stewart's killer, according to prosecutors. More than a decade later, DNA evidence confirmed McGuire's guilt, and he acknowledged that he was responsible in a letter to Governor John Kasich last month. 'One can scarcely conceive of a sequence of crimes more shocking to the conscience or to moral sensibilities than the senseless kidnapping and rape of a young, pregnant woman followed by her murder,' Preble County prosecutors said in a filing with the state parole board last month. His attorneys argued McGuire was mentally, physically and sexually abused as a child and had impaired brain function that made him prone to act impulsively. 'Dennis was at risk from the moment he was born,' the lawyers said in a parole board filing. 'The lack of proper nutrition, chaotic home environment, abuse, lack of positive supervision and lack of positive role models all affected Dennis' brain development.' Documents obtained by The Associated Press show McGuire unsuccessfully sought a reprieve in recent weeks to try to become an organ donor. In November, Kasich granted a death row inmate an eight-month reprieve to let the prison system study his request to donate a kidney to his sister and his heart to his mother. Kasich said McGuire couldn't identify a family member who would receive his organs, as required under prison policy. New drugs: Ohio officials used intravenous doses of the sedative midazolam and the painkiller hydromorphone to put McGuire, pictured at an undated court hearing, to death . Crime scene: The pregnant 22-year-old was found dead in a dark wood, pictured, in 1989 . In the letter Joy's sister wrote, she described her 10-years-younger, adopted sister as the light of her family's life. 'She . was born Christmas Day, 1966 but I haven't spoken to her in more than . 24 years. Her voice was silenced on February 11, 1989 when Dennis . McGuire brutally ended her life.' Avery said the soon-to-be mom was excited about the birth of her baby boy, who tragically died too the day of the murder. 'She . never got to realize her dreams, never got to hold her baby boy in her . arms, never got to kiss his soft cheek, never got to see him smile,' she . wrote. Avery described how the grief following Joy's murder destroyed her parents. 'They never fully recovered and both died knowing that her killer still lived,' she said. Regarding . the contentious lethal injection McGuire was given, Avery wrote: 'There . has been a lot of controversy regarding the drugs that are to be used . in his execution, concern that he might feel terror, that he might . suffer. 'As I recall the . events preceding her death; forcing her from the car, attempting to rape . her vaginally, sodomizing her, choking her, stabbing her, leaving her . to bleed out: I know she suffered terror and pain. 'He is being treated far more humanely than he treated her.'","Dennis McGuire's family say the drug cocktail used to kill him caused him to suffer as he died .

His mugshot shows how he bears a strong resemblance to TV's Frank Gallagher (right)  from the hit show Shameless . Caught: Bernard Moore being arrested by riot police in a shop doorway in Manchester after trying to gouge a police officer's eyes out . Magistrates' courts in London, Manchester and the West Midlands sat throughout the night to process the huge . numbers of rioters and looters from four nights of shocking disorder. Dozens of offenders were behind bars just 24 hours after committing their crimes. Moore pleaded guilty to using threatening words or . behaviour likely to cause alarm or distress and assaulting a constable . in the execution of their duty. The . defendant, said to be clearly under the influence of alcohol or . drugs, shouted abuse at police and attacked PC Joseph Doyle. The officer told the court in a statement: 'I could feel him scratching at my face trying . to gouge my eyes out.' Moore then told the policeman: 'I will come for you when you are asleep.' District Judge Khalid Qureshi dismissed his claims it was a reckless assault rather than intentional and sent Moore to prison. He said the victim had been lucky to escape with only a . small cut to his nose. Prison vans lined up around the block to deliver the defendants. Three . district judges sat in three courts from about 9pm onwards last . night in a bid to deal with 117 defendants in custody. Matters . were being processed in batches of three defendants being brought up . from the cells but progress was slow with only six cases held in Court . 16 within two hours.

Paul Obonyano was jailed for assaulting an officer . The court heard that Ricky Gemmell, 18, of . Levenshulme, left his call centre job and changed out of his suit before returning to the city to join the riots. Moments after police officers were pelted with bottles and missiles by a large pack of marauding . youths, the teenager - who has applied to join the army - began taunting them at Market Street. David Beswick, 30, of Eccles, ran out of petrol while fleeing with a £400 TV he was handed after Cash Generator was raided. He was spotted by police officers walking down the street with a fuel can and when they searched his car, the booty was . recovered. He has been remanded in . custody after admitting handling stolen goods. A suspected rioter makes an obscene gesture in the back of a prison van at Westminster Court .

The 22-year-old, of Eccles, scraped a . police officer along the floor as he tried to escape his grip, causing minor injuries. He grinned . as he told officers 'I'm here looting'. He has now been jailed for . four months. In another Manchester case, a 16-year-old boy admitted trespassing Svarowski . jewellers in the city centre with a view to stealing. His mother was in court to hear the . teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was caught as he . attempted to flee the shop. Officers . on patrol in the area at about 8pm saw the front window smashed and . groups of people were running into the shop masked and unmasked. The youth was apprehended and detained in a storeroom. It emerged he had decided to come into the centre after he received a BlackBerry message saying 'come to town'. His solicitor said he was awaiting his GCSE results and was hopeful of a college place. District Judge Qureshi said: . 'The aggravating feature is he has responded to a message. It was . pre-planned, it was organised. He has then gone there to meet people. 'He . knew full well what was going on in the country. Somebody from the moon . would be aware of what has been going on in the country . 'I . am sure looking at the horror on his mum's face when she heard what he . had done, it will not be a pleasant return home for him.' BlackBerry . Messenger featured in another case of a 20-year-old man from Stretford . who was accused of attempting to break into the Argos store in Stretford . Mall. He made no plea and . was remanded in custody but the court heard it was allegedly an . organised incident in which he met up with a friend via BlackBerry with a . view to targeting the shop. Meanwhile, an 11-year-old girl allegedly involved in the riots on Tuesday in Nottingham has been arrested. Late night ride: A suspected rioter is taken to the City of Westminster Magistrates' Court in London which ran all night to process the huge number of defendants arrested during the disturbances .

She has been charged with criminal damage and attempted criminal damage and remanded into custody. So . far 105 people have been arrested in connection with disturbances in . Nottingham with 46 of them charged with numerous offences. At . Westminster Magistrates Court in London, which was tasked with pushing . through the 371 people who have so far been charged by the Metropolitan . Police from 888 arrests, the public galleries were full at times despite . the lateness of the hour. Almost 100 people appeared overnight, with prosecutors working 5pm to 9am shifts. About 30 more people charged with offences linked to the rioting are expected to appear before the court today. The court heard that a graduate who hoped to become a social worker admitted she stole a TV during the rioting in Enfield. Natasha Reid, 24, from Edmonton, north London, pleaded . guilty to theft and entering with intent to steal. She had been on her way to McDonald's when she noticed a . Comet store had been broken into and helped herself to a £300 JVC television. Her defence lawyer said Reid handed herself into police because she could not sleep with guilt. The case was adjourned for sentencing until September 1. The court also . heard a 16-year-old rioter hurled a rock at a police car then claimed . he was a friend of Mark Duggan and told officers: 'You lot should not be . so trigger happy' The tearaway told police: 'I knew Mark, he was a friend of the family.' Teenager: This young girl was among the people processed by Westminster Magistrates Court overnight . He was eventually caught, hiding his face with a ski mask. In East Sussex, a 27-year-old man was remanded in custody after he allegedly encouraged looting on Facebook. The Hastings Magistrates' Court heard Nathan Sinden posted messages saying: 'Let's start a riot in Hastings. Who is on it?' and 'Looting it is then today. Who is up for shopping?' He was charged with inciting criminal damage and burglary. Prosecutor Jeremy King said: 'The messages caused undue fear and anxiety to many people, fearing violence may take place in their home town.' Two men from Lancashire have also been been charged after posting messages encouraging disorder on Facebook. Christopher Schofield, 25, of Nelson, and Warren Calvert, 19, of Heysham, were . charged with intentionally encouraging or assisting in the commission of . an offence, believing it would be committed. Both were bailed to appear at a later date. Standing order: Police officers stand guard as a procession of prison vans arrive at Westminster Magistrates' Court . A 16-year-old boy and . 18-year-old Steven Jones, 16, are to appear at courts in Essex today . charged with using social networking sites to incite others to commit . violent disorder. At Solihull Magistrates' Courts in . Birmingham, five people were sent to prison overnight while one juvenile . was bailed with strict conditions, including an electronic curfew, said . West Midlands Police. The fast track process was intended to deal with those charged in connection with the disorder in the region. Chief Superintendent Phil Kay said: . 'This is a first for the West Midlands and has given us the opportunity . to put before the courts the prisoners involved in the disorder in a . really timely manner which helps speed up the judicial process.' A total of 24 prisoners have so far . been processed there, including 18 adults and six juveniles, the force . said. The majority have been charged with burglary, violent disorder and . arson. The Metropolitan Police's Deputy Assistant Commissioner, Stephen . Kavanagh, said some of his officers were disappointed with the sentences . handed out to looters. He . told BBC Breakfast: 'That has been personally raised by me and others, . and the commissioner I know has also raised it, so we will move through . those issues and I am confident we will get the support of the courts.' He said the huge policing presence on the streets would continue for another night, and would then be reviewed. He added that more than 100 arrest warrants were being executed this morning.","Frank Gallagher lookalike tried to gouge police officer's eyes out .

"By . Mark Duell . Screeching high-speed through the streets of Georgia in and out of queuing traffic, this breathtaking set of videos shows a group of young extreme stunt drivers living on the edge. Now the Need For Drive team, who film themselves driving through Tbilisi in the ex-Soviet republic, are attempting to turn their dangerous hobby into a career and attract attention from Hollywood. One video shows the group leader Giorgi Tevzadze driving his 1995 BMV M5 at top speeds through the capital, on streets crowded with public transportation, traffic and pedestrians crossing the road. Scroll down for video . Skillful: The team leader said he is regularly fined by traffic police but also still legally has his driver's licence . Amazed: This pedestrian was shocked to see a car suddenly appear at high speed on the road as he crossed . Smoking: Need For Drive team member Giorgi Lomtanidze said he was hoping for Hollywood attention . The clip featured the warning 'Do not try this!' and received 2million YouTube views in a week. Mr Tevzadze said he hoped the videos would help him and his team turn their hobby into a profession. ‘We have more practical plans, to find sponsors among the viewers of these videos, to show we can advertise a company or a product of a company by making our videos,’ he added. Mr Tevzadze, who runs a small business, said he was first drawn to racing and stunt driving aged 13, and been attempting to improve his skills and develop the hobby into a business ever since. He is trying to start a school of extreme driving to help people safely avoid dangerous situations on the road, and also dreams about catching the attention of Hollywood with his driving videos. Stunts: The Need For Drive team, who video themselves driving through Tbilisi in the ex-Soviet republic, are attempting to turn their dangerous hobby into a career and attract attention from Hollywood . Mr Tevzadze said: ‘If we get noticed . by from someone from Hollywood, we will be able to offer a variety of . scenarios connected with street racing and to perform extreme . manoeuvres. ‘Those may . include chasing a vehicle, or racing with two or more cars in traffic. Our team can perform any scenario connected with vehicles while driving . at the highest possible level.’ The team leader said he is regularly fined by traffic police but also still legally has his driver's licence. ‘As . for uploading these extreme driving videos, they were shot quite a long . time ago and that is why we did not see (any legal) problem after . posting them,’ Mr Tevzadze said. Plans: Group leader Giorgi Tevzadze is trying to start a school of extreme driving to help people safely avoid dangerous situations on the road, and also dreams about catching the attention of Hollywood . Extraordinary scenes: In one video a car can be seen weaving in and out of traffic going in both directions . He added that he was focused on . garnering attention without putting others in danger. And one fan said . while some of the driving might be illegal, the members were all . generally responsible people. ‘I do not think their behaviour was correct from the point of the law,’ the fan, Iako Askurava, said. ‘But . when you get to know these guys better, you understand that they do . everything really skilfully and they lead a very healthy way of life,’ added the Tbilisi State University law student. Need For Drive team member Giorgi Lomtanidze said he was after Hollywood attention - not a profession as a stunt driver. Tight spaces: The drivers screech high-speed through the streets of Georgia in and out of queuing traffic . Teenage love: Group leader Giorgi Tevzadze said he was first drawn to racing and stunt driving aged 13, and been attempting to improve his skills and develop the hobby into a business ever since . Dangerous: Tbilisi is a city that the U.S. Embassy has warned visitors is full of 'drivers who pay little attention to speed limits, lane discipline and regularly encroach into oncoming traffic' ‘As for Hollywood, this might be beyond the limit of our dreams, as it will be (a chance) to become recognisable faces, to participate in great projects and to show our professionalism to the wider public,’ Mr Lomtanidze said. Last year Georgia's online newspaper The Financial conducted research on the most dangerous roads for car accidents and tried to determine the average age of the drivers prone to accidents. Based on the data presented by insurance firms, the newspaper wrote that ‘the most dangerous cohort of drivers on the road’ in Georgia belong to the people between the ages of 21 and 35. Tbilisi is a city that the U.S. Embassy has warned visitors is full of ‘drivers who pay little attention to speed limits, lane discipline and regularly encroach into oncoming traffic’.","Need For Drive team film themselves driving through Tbilisi in Georgia .

"By . Maysa Rawi . Updated: . 13:08 EST, 9 December 2011 . The Pakistani model at the centre of the FHM India row says the stress caused by the scandal has aged her. Veena Malik is suing the publishers of the magazine claims cover was doctored to make her appear nude when she actually posed in clothes. But she revealed today that since launching her lawsuit, she has been threatened in an attempt to get her to drop it. The 33-year-old told the Mail Online: 'I feel completely cheated. They've added ten years to my age. 'They threatened to sue me if I don't keep quiet.' Veena Malik claims she was wearing hotpants, which were removed by Photoshop on the cover of FHM India . Malik appeared naked on the cover of the December issue of FHM India with just her arms and legs covering her modesty, sporting a tattoo of the initials 'ISI' on her arm, a reference to Pakistan's intelligence agency. The image sparked outrage in her homeland. She said: 'The . image we shot was completely different to the one on the cover. I was . wearing hot pants and they promised me they would cover my . upper body with multiple tattoos. 'Instead, they removed the hot pants.' The actress claims she was in the past approached to pose for nude pictures by other agencies, but always refused . She also claims the editor-in-chief Kabeer Sharma and . the journalist who interviewed her refused to respond to her calls . following the release of the issue, despite being in daily contact with . them prior to the shoot. FHM India is owned by Maxposure, separate to the UK-owned FHM, which is published by Bauer Media. Since then, Malik says she has received a . legal notice from FHM India which she claims was 'aggressive' in tone, . and she says threatened her with character defamation if she did not retract her allegations. Malik said: 'I did not sign any contract and refused to until I was given final approval of the images. I was never sent the pictures but I was assured they were the same shots taken on the shoot in November. 'I was cool with those pictures because I felt they were artistic and beautiful. They should have waited for my authorisation but they didn't. 'There was only one week between the shoot and publication - they were obviously in a rush to print them without my consent.' Veena said FHM India would contact her twenty times a day to convince her to pose for the magazine - and then refused to return her calls following publication . The model, who is currently in Mumbai filming, has since been disowned by her father, who said he wishes his daughter to be punished. Veena said: 'Of course I am sad and upset but hopeful too, when I go back home, I will sit down and make him understand. 'I want to speak to my father in person, my family know the kind of person I am and would never go against the personal rules I set myself. 'I am still speaking to my mother and sister, they know what the reality is, but they are upset about the way it was projected in the media. 'The way the media is projecting it, . calling it a nude shoot, the shoot is not a nude shoot.' The 33-year-old also revealed she has already been approached by an international agency in the past to do nude images. She said: 'I was approached in the past to do nude shots for money and I refused. So why would I accept to do that for FHM India for free?' Despite the fallback, Malik claims she is still being supported by her fans - and wouldn't rule out a nude shoot in the future. She said: ' I'm a very strong person. If I did something like that, I would stand by my actions. 'Would I pose nude In the future? Who knows what will happen tomorrow.' Sharma vehemently denies the pictures are doctored and that the model has been threatened, insisting Malik has given contradictory accounts of the shoot. He said: 'It's important to note Ms Malik has been dragging the magazine's name through muck by making false and baseless allegations and we look at it very, very seriously. 'I invite Ms Malik to furnish one shred of evidence, SMS or a witness to support her allegations which are as concocted as the ones she's been making all week. Veena is hoping to reconcile with her father, who has disowned her since seeing the pictures . 'No one in FHM has had any conversation with Ms Malik directly or indirectly to make this ""imagined threat"". 'The one message that was sent to her was one that told her she could call the office landline if she wanted to have a conversation. 'Ms Malik was more than comfortable with the filming, it was only when the cover and the grenade shots were done was the videographer asked to stop filming to make the team more comfortable (not her). 'She did not even once ask him to stop filming.' Malik claims no such video was taken and that when she noticed filming taking place, when she was fully clothed she asked them to stop as it was not in line with the previous agreement to only shoot images. But Miss Malik is no stranger to . controversy. In January she attacked attacked hardline clerics in . Pakistan who demand modest Muslims should be suitably covered at all . times. She also launched a stringent attack on honour killings, highlighting that women were always the target and not men. After making her name has a star in . 'Lollywood' movies -  the term used to describe films made in Lahore - . she found greater fame when she took part in Big Boss 4, the Indian . version of Big Brother, last year.","'I was wearing hotpants, claims Veena Malik .

"By . Rob Cooper . A Somalian grandmother was allowed to come to Britain to live in a council house with her daughter who is an unemployed single mother-of-three living on benefits. Halima Jimale, 68, was reunited with her daughter Fadumo Mohamed, 43, who claims £310 a week in handouts despite fears that she would also be a drain on taxpayers' money. A relative promised to give the pensioner £100 a week so she didn't have to rely on benefits as well - but the tribunal heard he had just £1.15 in his bank account. Hearing: The Tribunal judge ruled that Halima Jimale, 68 could come to Britain to live with her daughter . But despite this, judges in the Immigration and Asylum Chamber Upper Tribunal gave Ms Jimale permission to come to Britain. They ruled that fellow Somalian Abdulkadir Elmi, 46, who is a security guard earning £22,400 a year would do his best to support the family. The tribunal, sitting in London, heard that Ms Jimale will live rent free in her daughter's council house with her three grandchildren. As Mrs Mohamed was already living in a council house, the court ruled it would not cost the state any more to have her mother brought to Britain as well. Mr Justice Bernard McCloskey heard that the single mother receives £188 a month in child benefit for her three children, £101 income support and £165 per week in tax credits. Despite Mr Elmi's lack of money they found 'there is a clear bond of mutual loyalty and support' in Somalian family culture and he could be depended on to provide money to the pensioner. If the security guard stops handing over £100 per week to the family, Ms Jimale will be forced to rely on state handouts. The tribunal was told that Mr Elmi had just £1.15 in his account because he had been sending money to his parents in Somalia. However, he had recently stopped as they had got jobs. The Home Office argued that Ms Jimale shouldn't be allowed into the country because there was no evidence that the distant relative would actually hand over any money. A spokesman for the Home Office said: 'We are disappointed with the judgment in this case, however we can only challenge decisions if an error of law is detected. In this case there were no grounds for further appeal. 'We are clear that those who wish to make a life in the UK with their family, work hard and make a contribution are welcome - but family life must not be established here at the UK taxpayer's expense.'","Halima Jimale, 68, came to Britain to be reunited with her daughter .

"By . Mark Prigg . Amazon has launched a budget £159 tablet it hopes can take on the iPad mini. The Fire HD tablet, which is based on Google's Android software, has a 7inch touchscreen and is linked to Amazon's own app, music and book store. It will go head to head with Apple's £269 iPad mini, which is launched next week, and Google's £159 Nexus 7 tablet. Scroll down for video . Competition: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos holds up the new Kindle Fire HD 7"" and Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" which is one of the iPad's top competitors . The tablet wars: How they stack up . Amazon has released two version, a cheaper £129 Fire with a poorer quality screen, and the £159 Fire HD, which experts expect to be the big seller. Amazon hopes the low price will help it take on Apple, who release the iPad mini in the UK next week for. 'The biggest factor is price - the Kindle Fire HD is so much cheaper,' said Chris Hall of gadget Web Site Pocket Lint. 'The Kindle name is well know, so it's not entirely new to people, and most potential owners probably already have some Kindle books or have bought content from Amazon.' Mr Hall believes the key difference between the tablets is their interface. 'Amazon has decided to make it content focused - the focus is on content not apps. 'It really comes down to what you want to do with it - people won't take it into a meeting and tap out notes, but it will be very popular with travellers and commuters. 'It's going to be a fiercly fought battle, and Amazon are slightly on the back foot now the iPad mini has been announced. 'People who couldn't afford an iPad may get a mini instead.' The new Kindle Fire HD tablet . The Fire HD is a well built tablet, and the rubberised back and surround make it feel more durable than an iPad. Switch it on, and the 7 inch screen is sharp, clear and easy to read. However, the main difference is in the software. The Kindle software puts content, not apps first. It works using a 'carousel' you scroll through with a finger, with content divided into books, music, apps, video and others. It's extremely simple to get around, but does feel far more 'contained' that the rivals from Google and Apple - this is a gadget for consuming media rather than any attempt to work. Sadly, the app selection is also smaller than its rivals, with 50,000 available. However, there are still most of the big names in there (including the MailOnline app), and the web browser also works well. For app addicts, this probably isn't the right tablet. But for those who primarily want a gadget to read and watch films on, the Fire HD is an absolute bargain, and it's only real competition in the budget market comes from Google's Nexus 7, which runs the firm's Android software and has more apps, but a much more complex interface. Overall, the Fire HD is a winner and could see many people switching from dedicated ebooks into the world of tablets - and the lower price may even lure a few iPad mini purchasers to switch allegiance. Users can also watch films via Lovefilm as Amazon does not yet have a film service in the UK. 'Kindle Fire HD is our most advanced 7” tablet and is already the bestselling product for Amazon worldwide,' said Jorrit Van der Meulen, VP Kindle, Amazon EU. 'Kindle Paperwhite is the e-reader we always wanted to build and pre-orders have exceeded all expectations.' 'We’re excited that Kindle Paperwhite, Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD are available to customers in the UK today.' The firm has also signed up several UK high street retailers to sell the devices. Steve Monaghan, Waterstones eCommerce and IT Director, said, 'Waterstones is the home of reading on the high street, so it is apt and exciting that we are now able to sell the digital reader's device of choice, Kindle. 'Where better to buy the latest Kindle than somewhere you can be surrounded by inspiration, both in print and from our booksellers - who are happy to advise and discuss books in all their myriad forms.' 'We are excited to offer our customers the opportunity to touch, test and buy the all-new Kindle family from Tesco stores nationwide, as well as online at Tesco Direct' said Tesco Electricals Director Ian Ditcham. 'Kindle was a must-have product for many Tesco customers last Christmas and with the new, expanded range now available at great prices, we think they’ll be appearing on many Christmas lists this year too.' Adam Brown, buyer for Tablets and Telecoms at John Lewis said, 'There are a plethora of new tablets launching into the market, but the thing that makes the Kindle Fire HD stand out for me is the sheer amount of content that it offers.' Mark Slater, Category Director for Computing at Currys and PC World, said: 'We're expecting tablets to be hugely popular this Christmas and Amazon's Kindle Fire products should prove no exception.' The £109 Kindle Paperwhite is the best e-book on the market thanks to its superb screen and easy to use interface . The Kindle Paperwhite . has a new screen with a built in light meaning it can be read at night as well as in direct sunlight. It's software has also been updated since the original Kindle, with new features including a Time to Read . feature that helps readers know the amount of time it will take them to . finish a chapter or book, X-Ray to explore the 'Bones of a Book,'  and find out more information about character or places. It's the same small size as previous Kindle's, and the touchscreen is very responsive for page turning. The screen is a delight - it's sharp, simple to read and makes reading in bed easy, a key complaint about the previous version. Overall, the Kindle Paperwhite is simply the best e-reader on the market, but is facing an increasing threat from tablet and smartphones, including Amazon's own Kindle Fire.","First time Amazon has released tablet outside of the US - and has been priced significantly cheaper than Apple's £269 iPad mini .

"By . Rebecca English . Buckingham Palace has played host to some flamboyant characters over the years. So perhaps it was unsurprising that barely a courtly eyebrow was raised when transvestite potter Grayson Perry collected his CBE from Prince Charles yesterday in a midnight blue dress and jacket, heels, and fabulously over-the-top black hat. Indeed, when asked about what Perry joyfully described as his ‘Italian mother of the bride outfit’, the Queen’s official spokesman replied with only the merest hint of a smile: ‘His attire was entirely appropriate.’ My husband and I: Grayson Perry (left) and his wife Phillipa (right) outside Buckingham Palace. Perry wore a midnight blue dress to collect his CBE . Investiture: Mr Perry shakes hand with the Prince of Wales as he receives the CBE . The Turner Prize winner became the first male cross-dresser to collect a gong wearing a dress.Charles got a fit of the giggles as Perry, in heavy make-up and a sweep of fuschia-pink lipstick, was introduced but the two were quickly chatting like old friends. The prince couldn’t place Perry’s medal for services to contemporary art over his head because of the size of his hat, so handed it to him instead. Perry, 54, who bowed rather than curtseyed, said he designed his outfit specially for the event, but first wore the hat ‘when I went away on a Transvestite Bridal Weekend’. The artist, accompanied by his wife Philippa, 56, and daughter Flo, 21, said his outfit had been agreed in advance with the palace, adding: ‘They are pretty cool here.’ Or, as one royal source put it: ‘People would have been more upset if he had turned up in jeans.’ Close encounter: The artist shook hands with Prince Charles as he picked up the gong at Buckingham Palace . Chat: Mr Perry and Prince Charles have a brief conversation during the investiture ceremony . Speaking after the ceremony Perry said: . 'Receiving this was great, it's not just for me it's for all the artists . - no really it's just for me, for 30 years of hard graft.' Mr . Perry, 53, once described Claire as 'a cross between Katie Boyle and . Camilla Parker-Bowles' but when reminded of this he laughed and said: . 'This is my Italian mother of the bride outfit.' He . added: 'When I got the call my first thought was,  ""What am I going to . wear?"" It's a serious thing, I'm not going to compromise my identity as . Britain's pre-eminent transvestite. 'I Googled to see what people wore and went for the sexier end. I always do like the older woman who makes an effort.' Other . people who received honours from Prince Charles today included darts . champion Catrina Gulliver, awarded an MBE, and comedy producer Gareth . Gwenland, who was given an OBE. Former . newsreader Julia Somerville was also recognised, receiving an OBE for . her work supporting the arts as a former chairman of the Government Art . Collection's advisory committee. Mr . Perry, who grew up in Essex, made his name with hand-crafted pottery . which is often illustrated with disturbing scenes of sex and child . abuse. Royal occasion: Mr Perry posing with a pair of Beefeaters outside the Palace today . Family: Mr Perry with his wife Philippa and their 21-year-old daughter Flo after the ceremony . He achieved widespread public fame in . 2003 when he was awarded the Turner Prize - the first potter ever to . receive Britain's most prestigious arts prize. At the time, the judges praised him for 'subverting the craft form of ceramics'. Born . in 1960 in Chelmsford, he began his career at Braintree College of . Further Education and then at Portsmouth Polytechnic, where he studied . fine art. Mr Perry says he realised he was a transvestite when he was teenager, and was thrown out of his father's home by his stepmother. Eminent: Mr Perry with GQ editor Dylan Jones, who was awarded an OBE today . Outfit: Grayson Perry dressed as an 'Italian mother of the bride' to receive the CBE at Buckingham Palace . Later when he moved to London in the . early 1980s he began attending evening pottery classes and developed a . strong connection with the medium. He has said that he loves using clay because 'it is held in such low esteem in the art world'. His . pots are covered with subject matter such as child abuse, . autobiographical images of himself, Claire and his family, as well as . examinations of cultural stereotypes. Alter ego: Mr Perry regularly dresses as a woman called 'Claire' and is known for his graphic pots . Victory: Mr and Mrs Perry with Flo after he won the Turner Prize in 2003 . Grayson Perry, 53, is known for being both a celebrated potter and arguably Britain's highest-profile transvestite. He . was kicked out of his home as a teenager after he admitted that he . wanted to wear women's clothes, but after going to art school in . Portsmouth he moved to London and began his celebrated career. Working . in the unfashionable medium of pottery, Mr Perry struggled to win . acceptance in the art world, but after being awarded the Turner Prize in . 2003 he became a national celebrity. In . the past few years he has curated an exhibition at the British Museum . and presented a series on Channel 4, cementing his status as one of the . country's leading artists. Despite . his outlandish image, Mr Perry has a highly conventional home life - he . has been married to Philippa, a psychotherapist and author, for more . than two decades. The couple have one child, 21-year-old Flo. Mr . Perry, who grew up in Essex, made his name with hand-crafted pottery . which is often illustrated with disturbing scenes of sex and child . abuse.

"Authorities say the child's body found Friday on the side of a highway in central Massachusetts is Jeremiah Oliver. Officials said initially that the remains matched the height and weight of the 5-year-old boy who has been missing for seven months, and were able to confirm the ID Saturday after an autopsy was performed. 'It appears to be a homicide,' Worcester County District Attorney Joseph Early Jr said at a Friday news conference. The body's identification was first reported by Boston Globe. Found dead: A body recovered near a wooded area in Massachusetts on Friday morning is said to be missing five-year-old Fitchburg boy Jeremiah Oliver. Tests: Massachusetts State Police stand along Interstate 190 where police said a child's body was found near Sterling . 'I don’t feel relief,' Jeremiah’s father Jose Oliver told the paper. 'I’m disappointed.' He was notified only minutes before officials made the information public and will travel Sudnay to Massachusetts from his Connecticut home. Early said the body was found at about 9 a.m. by a police search team about 40 feet off U.S. Highway 190 near Sterling, which is about 12 miles from Fitchburg. He said it was wrapped in blanket-like material, and packed in material that resembled a suitcase. He would not say what led authorities to the location, or how long the body may have been there. He said the site is near an area that is regularly mowed on the side of the highway but would not have been visible to passing cars. The main suspects: Elsa Oliver (left), 28, and Alberto Sierra (right), 22, have been charged with multiple counts related to the young boy's disappearance . Jeremiah was last seen by relatives in September but wasn't reported missing until December. Authorities have said they feared he was dead. Jeremiah's mother, Elsa Oliver, pleaded not guilty in March to charges including kidnapping, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, and reckless endangerment. Her boyfriend pleaded not guilty to similar charges. They have been held since December on lesser charges in the case. Jeremiah was reported missing in December after his sister told someone at her school that she and her siblings were being abused. Unusual behavior: Elsa Oliver, seen here in December, began acting strangely and refused to speak to even her own lawyer . Emotionless: Elsa Oliver reportedly spoke to a relative recently and randomly interjected asking 'Is it the Rapture?' The girl said the last time she saw Jeremiah his hand was bleeding for unexplained reasons, his mother Elsa was reportedly worried that he would die as a result of the hand wound. Elsa Oliver and her boyfriend Alberto Sierra, 22, were first brought into court in December. During the initial investigation a strange clue was offered when it was found that Elsa had a tattoo with a butterfly and the date 'Sept. 25, 2013' written below it. Police have spoken to local tattoo artists because they want to know whether she told a tattoo artist why that date is significant. Missing: The search had been going on since December although young Jeremiah Oliver has not been seen since September . It is not clear why it took three months for authorities to be notified of Jeremiah's disappearance, but an anonymous tip led them to believe that the mother's boyfriend may have had something to do with the alleged abuse. A source told MailOnline that Sierra, 22, would bully and intimidate those around him, routinely becoming irate and even making death threats on more than one occasion. Both Elsa Oliver and Alberto Sierra face multiple charges, including assault with a dangerous weapon (a belt), two counts of reckless endangerment of a child and two counts of being an accessory after the fact of a felony and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. The family was being monitored by state social workers since 2011. And after Jeremiah's disappearance, their case led to intense scrutiny of the state Department of Children and Families. Three employees of the agency — a social worker, a supervisor and an area manager — were fired after an internal investigation. Officials said the social worker had not made required monthly visits to the family. The governor asked the Child Welfare League of America to review DCF but resisted calls from some lawmakers to fire Olga Roche, the agency's commissioner. In an initial report filed by the league last month, it recommended that Massachusetts take a number of steps to shore up its child welfare system, including boosting staffing levels to reduce social worker caseload. A separate report from the state's Child Advocate, Gail Garinger, suggested that state social workers missed nearly one in five home visits during a recent 12-month period, though state officials said the figure was likely overstated. Roche assured state legislators in January that DCF had accounted for the safety of all other young children in its care. Oliver and Sierra, who were indicted by a Worcester County grand jury, are both being held on bail — $100,000 for Oliver and $250,000 for Sierra. Three other people have been charged with interfering with a criminal investigation and misleading police in connection with the case.","Jeremiah Oliver was last seen on September 14 .

''""This is my first night,"" I said. ""I could tell,"" he said. ""I'm honoured"". Then he told me that I reminded him of his granddaughter.' For Holly Austen Smith, then just 14 years old, this episode marked the start of her short-lived career as a prostitute. Overcoming adversity: Holly Austin Smith, now 36, has taken years to recover from the trafficking ordeal . Vulnerable: Holly, pictured in her middle school graduation photo, was 14 when she was trafficked . An unhappy teen growing up in Atlantic County, New Jersey, her ordeal began after being approached by a man who gave his name as Greg during a trip to a shopping mall. Blinded by dreams of love and a job in the fashion or music industries, Holly, now 36, was easy prey for the unscrupulous sex trafficking gang in whose hands she ended up. But while stories of Eastern European or Chinese girls being trafficked are all too common, Holly was a middle class girl from a sleepy American town. So what went wrong? 'This is something I talk about a lot in my book,' explains Holly, now a happily married mother who lives in Richmond, Virginia. 'Often children who are trafficked have a background that is troubled in some way, whether sexual abuse in early childhood, domestic violence at home or  substance abuse.' For Holly, the problems began when she was sexually abused by a much older cousin. The years of what she describes as 'mild abuse' led to problems with her parents, who she says made her spend time with her cousin, despite her protests. 'That followed through childhood and because of what happened with my cousin, I harboured resentment towards my parents,' she explains. 'That eventually led to a lot of anger between me and my parents and then at middle school, I fell into a bad crowd. I was what you would call a problem child.' By the time she reached her early teens, Holly had become rebellious, running away from home on several occasions and dressing provocatively in a bid to gain attention. Sadly for Holly, she did indeed become the subject of adult attention: the attention of a trafficking gang intent on exploiting the vulnerable teen. 'All children are vulnerable to crossing paths with traffickers,' adds Holly, whose book, Walking Prey, details how trafficking gangs choose their victim. Troubled: Holly, pictured aged 14, had a troubled childhood and an uneasy relationship with her parents . 'That day, that guy [Greg]  was standing in a payphone booth. I don't think he was really on the phone at all. 'I think he was scanning the crowd and when he saw me I was straggling behind my friends and dressed in a way that suggested I was looking for attention from older guys.' The man approached her and flattered, she agreed to exchange phone numbers with him. He then spent the next two weeks chatting to the teenager over the phone, telling her she was special, beautiful and far too mature for school. Holly was smitten. 'I was unhappy at home - I was coercable,' she remembers. 'Traffickers take time with victims, feeling them out and convincing them to run away. 'He told me things that made me feel good about myself; that I was pretty enough to be a model. He painted a picture of a glamorous lifestyle to me. Advocacy: Since meeting a fellow survivor in 2009, Holly has become an anti-trafficking advocate . Important work: She travels around the world speaking about her experiences . 'He told me things like he could introduce me to famous people, get me into clubs and get me a job in the fashion or music industries.' Enraptured with the wonderful future that Greg appeared to be offering her, Holly agreed to run away with him less than two weeks after they met. But things swiftly began to go wrong. Writing in Walking Prey, she details the shocking moment when she finally realised what Greg's intentions really were. 'Nobody said the word prostitution,' she writes. 'It just hung in the air. Everything was moving so quickly. 'Nobody asked me if I was OK with this, or if this was what I had signed up for, or if I wanted some time to think about it. 'Neither Greg or Nikki asked me anything at all. Nikki called for a taxi and the two of us were on the way to Atlantic City.' What followed was horrifying. 'When the first man approached me, I . don't even think I was thinking of anything,' remembers Holly. 'I was overloaded with info . and completely out of my element. I just think that I was going through . the motions. 'At 14, I didn't really have a solid idea of consequences and I still . didn't completely understand prostitution. There were several men that . night and the following night.' In addition to the clients, the vulnerable schoolgirl was also raped by Greg. But salvation was at hand in the form of a policeman who approached her on the street to ask how old she was. Frightening: Most of the women and children trafficked endure months if not years of torture before rescue . Harrowing: Holly's book, Walking Prey, documents her experiences and is out now . At first, she stuck to the patter . Greg had given her but as the policeman walked away, she called out to . him. 'What if I wasn't [over 18]?' she asked. 'When the police officer walked . away from me, I realised that if I didn't reach out and say something, . this [prostitution] would continue,' she remembers. 'I . knew if I didn't say anything, it would continue.' Just 36 hours after . running away with Greg, Holly was back with her parents. But her problems didn't end there. Her parents had no idea how to handle what had happened, and Holly herself needed years to come to terms with being trafficked. 'By the time my parents arrived [to collect her from the police station], I had emotionally shut down,' says Holly. 'My few memories of my parents around that time are not great. I don't think they knew . how to handle the situation. She adds: 'A lot of anti-trafficking organisations recognise that the parents and . families if trafficking victims need support as well. 'They need to learn about what happened to their child, ideally before they're reunited with them. My parents didn't have that time so they didn't know how to handle it.' For Holly herself, the process of overcoming what happened to her has been a long one. 'It took . me many, many years to overcome it,' she says. 'We need to get survivors to realise that they are not at fault. I thought for a long time it was my fault because I chose . to go with him. 'I thought what had happened to me was all my own fault. It took me a very long time to realise that it wasn't.' Walking Prey: How America's Youth Are Vulnerable To Sex Slavery by Holly Austin Smith is published by Palgrave Macmillan and costs £17.99.

"By . Elizabeth Sanderson . and Katie Nicholl . The billionaire philanthropist Hans Rausing, who lost his wife two years ago after a tragic battle with drug addiction, has found love with the art expert Julia Delves Broughton. The Mail on Sunday can today reveal that Mr Rausing, the Tetra Pak heir, proposed to Miss Delves Broughton, a senior director at Christie’s auction house, while they were in Barbados last month. The couple, who are currently in Venice, have told their family friends they are planning a summer wedding. The announcement marks a milestone in a romance that has taken everyone by surprise. Few could have anticipated that Hans would ever find peace let alone happiness after years of unimaginable torment following the death of his American wife, Eva. Hans Rausing and Julia Delves Boughton, the couple met in 2002 but rekindled their relationship after Mr Rausing entered a psychiatric hospital following his former wife's tragic death . He and Eva had spent more than a decade addicted to drugs, and after her decomposing remains were discovered by police at their home in Belgravia, Central London, in the summer of 2012, the grim reality of that addiction was laid bare for all to see. After Eva’s death, Hans, 50, went to live at Capio Nightingale psychiatric hospital in Marylebone for two years to recover. It’s where he rekindled his friendship with Julia, who he first met more than a decade ago. Hans entered the hospital a cadaverous shell of man, broken both physically and emotionally – yet in the six months since his release, friends have witnessed a truly remarkable transformation. The private benefactor, who has given tens of millions of pounds to charities including The HALO Trust – which removes land mines left behind in wars – museums and veterans’ foundations, has put on weight and the colour has returned to his once hollow cheeks. But perhaps most significantly of all, Hans no longer seems haunted by the spectres of his past. And according to friends that is all thanks to Julia. Their romance and his recovery have been compared with Victoria Getty rescuing her husband Sir Paul Getty from addiction and helping him to become one of Britain’s greatest philanthropists. Mr Rausing's former wife Eva, left, who was found dead in 2012 in the couple's Chelsea home, right . The Rausings together will be strongly defined by their joint efforts to give away much of his fortune. A friend said: ‘It is very much both of them who are putting philanthropy at the centre of their new life together, both deciding what is given.’ Another friend was told: ‘We’re doing the charity giving together. Our main aim is to support young people, local small charities and mental health charities.’ Their marriage will bring together two extraordinary families – one Sweden’s most inventive industrial dynasty and the other a quirky, blue-blooded English family, legendary for both high living and high drama from Nairobi to Liverpool. Julia’s elder sister was the brilliant fashionista Isabella Blow, who took her own life seven years ago by drinking weedkiller. Their grandfather was Sir Jock Delves Broughton, a key member of the Kenyan Happy Valley set. He was sensationally acquitted of the murder of Lord Erroll, the lover of his wife, Diana, in the infamous ‘White Mischief’ case which was later made into a film starring Charles Dance and Greta Scacchi. In 1942, shortly after the trial, he took his own life, overdosing at the Adelphi Hotel in Liverpool. Julia and Isabella and their younger sister, Lavinia, were brought up at Doddington Hall, a 35,000-acre estate in Cheshire, by their father Sir Evelyn and mother Helen Mary Shore, a barrister. However, tragedy stalked the family. In 1964, the only boy of the family, John, drowned in the swimming pool when he was only two years old. Then, when the girls were entering their teens, their mother left home, bidding each of her daughters farewell with a formal handshake. Yet by all accounts, Julia is a level-headed yet spirited achiever with a penchant for high culture and high heels. One friend said: ‘Julia has a very uncomplicated attitude to life. Like her sister Issie, she is frank, funny and fearless. And like Issie she is untraditional in that she understands conformity but isn’t a conformist. Issie was one of the great celebrators of life and would have been overjoyed at her little sister finding the love of her life at this stage in life.’ Hans’s family are also thrilled. His parents, Hans Senior and Marit, who live in Wadhurst, East Sussex, have met his fiancee a number of times, as has his sister Sigrid, who last night said: ‘We are delighted. Julia and Hans have both been through terrible ordeals, and it’s very moving to see them together, filled with hope and confidence. ‘This is a second chance for Hans – he is very lucky to have found in Julia someone who has an instinctive understanding of emotional pain and the courage to face it with humour and determination.’ Sir Jock Delves Broughton, left, who was acquitted of killing the lover of his wife, Lady Delves Broughton, right . The couple first met in 2002 when Hans and Eva went to a lunch at Christie’s auction house in Mayfair, where Julia began working as a secretary 18 years ago. She quickly rose through the ranks, working in Old Masters, then the Valuation Department, before becoming a senior director working for Lord Linley in the Chairman’s Office. They then met again in 2006 when Hans, a serious art collector, called Christie’s in to make a valuation at his home in Belgravia. A senior art world figure said: ‘Julia is multi-talented in her sphere with her broad and deep knowledge of the art world and the wide range of people she knows. In that way she’s exemplary. She’s also liked by the people below her as well as the people above her.’ Certainly, she has had a remarkable effect on Hans, a shy, thoughtful man who has always felt the weight of his family’s fortune and who became a recluse for many years as he and Eva descended into addiction. Julia Delves Broughton is the sister of fashion designer Isabella Blow who tragically took her own life . A family friend said: ‘Hans is finding great succour in reconnecting with life, getting back with friends, reigniting old friendships. You have to remember he and Eva had been ill a very long time. They hadn’t seen anyone for years. The normalcy of life has been incredibly healing. From being a recluse, unable to talk to anyone... it is a fantastic transformation. Through Julia, Hans is finding life again.’ It is believed Julia visited Hans in hospital and played a key part in his rehabilitation. But just as she has helped him, so he has given her the happiness and security that eluded so many in her own family. ‘If anything, their pasts have helped concentrate their minds,’ one friend explained. ‘They know that you have to hold on to hope and  grab life while you can, although without forgetting the past and the people in it.’ The couple have a puppy, and enjoy going to the cinema, visiting friends and art galleries. They went to see Stanley Spencer’s war paintings at Somerset House and often visit Julia’s sister Lavinia in Gloucestershire, where they enjoy going to the local markets. Hans went with Julia to a charity dinner to raise money for the Isabella Blow Foundation last November. In February, he and Julia co-hosted a dinner at the National Gallery to mark the exhibition of German art, Strange Beauty: Masters of the German Renaissance, which was sponsored by Hans. One friend of the couple said: ‘They are head over heels in love. One only has to look at them to see it. They’re affectionate, they laugh a lot together. Julia’s not the self-pitying type. She has a very uncomplicated attitude to life which is very refreshing. And the change in Hans is remarkable. He looks well, his sense of humour is back. What a recovery. It’s astonishing, there is a sense of new hope about them.’ Hans Rausing in 2012 before entering the psychiatric hospital, he transformation has been astounding . Although they have yet to make plans for the wedding, Miss Delves Broughton is now sporting an engagement ring, which according to one who has seen it is ‘an enormous diamond with other diamonds on the inside’. Julia will become involved with her husband’s philanthropy work, which is vast yet discreet. Hans is one of the country’s most generous benefactors, donating to a wide variety of organisations including the Rehabilitation for Addicted Prisoners’ Trust, the Sir Oswald Stoll Foundation, which provides housing to disabled and homeless ex-service personnel, and MapAction, which provides mapping services in disaster zones. Hans lives in a flat in Belgravia but often stays at Julia’s modest flat overlooking Battersea Park in South London. One friend said: ‘He’s incredibly normal and domesticated, not at all what you’d expect of someone who is one of the richest men in the world. ‘What’s most noticeable is that they laugh at the same things and they’re unbelievably affectionate with each other. They have a shared interest in art and he’s also quirkily intellectual, loving old black and white movies and the writings of Raymond Carver.’ The couple will eventually move into a Grade II listed property in Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, that Hans bought from Roman Abramovich last December. It comprises three conjoined houses including a mansion dating from the 1670s which was once home to the artist James Whistler and the late Tory Minister Paul Channon. The house is in need of a major upgrade, expected to take at least a year. Hans is gradually parcelling up his past and moving forward but friends insist that is exactly what his wife would have wanted. One said: ‘Eva would be very very happy for Hans. Even in the darkest depths of their despair, Eva always wanted the best for Hans. She used to say, ‘‘If Hans is happy, I’m happy.’’ ’ Now, after years of darkness, it would appear that he is.","Hans Rausing proposed to partner Julia Delves Broughton last month .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The man who managed to escape a 75-minute carjacking by the Boston Marathon bombers and then lead to police to their whereabouts has spoken out on the anniversary of the attacks, telling of the 'incredible' 12 months he has endured and how he dealt with the ordeal. Now 27, the Chinese-American entrepreneur - who has chosen to be identified only as 'Danny' for personal security reasons - says he refuses to accept the 'hero' title he has been given, telling The Boston Globe he only ever thought about 'trying to save myself'. One year ago today - three days after two pressure bombs blasted through the finish line at the Boston Marathon, killing three people and injuring over 260 others - Danny pulled over his Mercedes SUV on Brighton Avenue about 10pm to reply to a text message he had recieved, when a car pulled up behind him. In the car were Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarneav, with Tamerlan foircing his way into Danny's vehicle. Hero: Chinese-American entrepreneur Danny speaks out about the one-year anniversary of his carjacking ordeal at the hands of Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarneav . Suspects: Dzhokhar, left, and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, right, hijacked the driver's car in Boston on the evening of April 18 (the brothers pictured on April 15 just moments before the Marathon blast . He told Danny he was responsible for the bombings and for killing a police officer, and to drive. At first Tamerlan demanded cash, with Danny handing over his wallet and the $45 cash in his car. Tamerlan continued to demand Danny drive, taking him into an area of Watertown, where they eventually stopped in a dark street. Dzhokhar pulled up behind them and started moving equipment from his car into Danny's. Tamerlan then ordered Danny into the backseat, with the brothers taking control of the car. They stopped nearby at an ATM, where Danny was forced to withdraw $800. As they were speaking in Russian, Danny couldn't understand what they were saying, but thought he heard them say 'Manhattan', and figured they were heading to New York. However his car had hardly any gas in it, so the brothers took the car back to Cambridge, stopping at a Shell service station on Memorial Drive. The station only accepted cash, so as Dzhokhar went inside to pay and Tamerlan configured the GPS, Danny made a daring escape. He ran, as fast as he could, straight across the street to another gas station, where he pleaded with the attendent to call 911. Frightening: The driver of the car Tamerlan Tsarnaev (left) and Dzhokhar (right) spoke mainly in Russian but then switched to English when they asked the man, Danny, about getting to New York . Police arrived within minutes, and he told them he could track his car using its onboard satellite system. Within 20 minutes, authorities ghad the Mercedes back in Watertown, where an explosive standoff left Tamerlan dead, with Dzhokhar driving over his brother's body in Danny's car to escape. It wasn't long before before Dzhokhar was found hiding in a wrapped boat in Waterdown. 'I'm still the same person,' Danny says now. 'Even though this happened to me, it doesn't change anything. 'Somethimes when I look back, I feel it's not my story, it's like it's somebody else's story.' Danny said at first he struggled to focus on anything other than this ordeal, but quickly resumed his routines as normal. 'I hope this story encourages some people,' he said. 'When [someone] is in a dangerous or difficult situation, you can still have opportunity. Just don’t give up.' Escape: The two bombing suspects pulled up at the Shell gas station to use a stolen ATM card from their hostage Danny. He managed to escape to the Mobil gas station across the street and call for help (right) He waited until May to tell his mother what happened, worried that she would make him move home. 'I told her, ‘Mom, it’s OK, I’m safe now, don’t be worried, because they have those two guys,’ he said. ‘One is dead and one is [in] custody, so they’re not able to hurt me again. And people here are so nice, so helpful.’ Still, Danny struggles with the hero tag. 'From my point, the definition of a hero is someone willing to sacrifice himself for somebody else,' he said. 'I don’t know, I was trying to save my own life.' He does admit, however, being brave enough to go the Marathon on Monday, content with being just another face in the crowd. 'The Marathon is a wonderful thing,' he said. 'A positive thing.'","Chinese-American entrepreneur 'Danny' was carjacked by Tamerlan Tsarneav on April 18, 2013 - three days after the Boston Marathon Bombings .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . If history tells us anything, when a white person dresses in blackface for any reason, it will almost always end in some sort of racially insensitive disaster - especially if you're a politician, an actor, or, in the case of Anna Bonham, a school board member in North Carolina. A photo surfaced last week that shows Bonham, the Caucasian District 7 representative to the Iredell-Stateville School District, dressed as African American tennis phenom Serena Williams. According to Bonham, the outfit was for a Halloween party she went to nearly five years ago. Bonham's costume is complete with a tennis racket, a poofy black wig and a pink tennis outfit - as well as a brown turtleneck presumably to represent Williams' dark skin and brown face-paint reminiscent of Al Jolsen in The Jazz Singer. Blackface: North Carolina school board member Anna Bonham wore this 'Serena Williams costume' to a Halloween party about five years ago . Blackface is often deemed offensive because of its implied stereotypical caricature of African Americans. North Carolina State University Associate Professor Blair Kelley explained why blackface is almost always deemed offensive in an article published on the website thegrio.com . 'Blackface minstrelsy first became nationally popular in the late 1820s when white male performers portrayed African-American characters using burnt cork to blacken their skin. Wearing tattered clothes, the performances mocked black behavior, playing racial stereotypes for laughs,' Kelley wrote in her article. Recently, Caucasian Dancing With the Stars personality Julianne Hough earned some negative headlines when she attended a Halloween party dressed in blackface, and Jewish New York State Assemblyman Dov Hikind also was criticized when a photo of him in blackface was discovered by the media. And on Wednesday, Bonham became the latest to be criticized for what many consider to be an offensive costume when an article was printed in the Statesville Record & Landmark that showed her in her Serena Williams costume. Colleagues say Bonham doesn't have a racist bone in her body, but agree that the costume was not the best choice . 'There was absolutely no ill-intent,' Bonham told WBTV on Friday. 'I am . an avid tennis fan and player (I play several times a week). Serena is . my favorite player.' The photo, which appeared on her Facebook page, was removed after the image was published by the newspaper and the public began to weigh in on her choice of costume - she says she removed the photo because of the 'increased media attention.' John Rogers, who also is a member of the school board, says he spoke with Bonham and believes that she truly regrets the photo. 'I wouldn't have done it,' said Rogers in an interview with WBTV, calling the costume a bad choice. 'I don't think there is a racist bone in her body,'he added. Bonham is running for re-election to her post on the school board, and Rogers thinks the photo may have emerged now as her opponents are trying to discredit her candidacy.","Anna Bonham is a representative on the Iredell-Stateville school board in North Carolina .

"By . Snejana Farberov . Without a trace: Helen Holladay, 45, was last seen alive leaving her mobile home in Texas after a fight with her husband on September 29, 1979 . A human skeleton found inside a truck pulled from a North Texas lake has been tentatively identified as a woman who went missing 35 years ago after a fight with her husband. A passerby discovered the partially exposed 1973-model Chevy pickup in Lake Granbury after the lake's water level dropped, thanks to the state's ongoing drought, and revealed a portion of the vehicle. The truck was found far away from any road or parking lot near the lake, and investigators ‘don't believe it was an accident,’ Hood County Sheriff Roger Deeds said. While inspecting the truck’s cab, investigators found human skeletal remains, pieces of clothing and a purse containing objects with Helen Holladay's name on them. Holladay was 45 years old when she disappeared in September 1979. Her husband, Herman, was a suspect in her disappearance but was never charged. He died in 1987 - a year after his wife was officially declared deceased. According to people who knew the couple back in the 1970s, the two had a very volatile relationship punctuated by instances of domestic violence. Scroll down for videos . Breakthrough: A passer-by discovered this disintegrating 1973-model Chevy pickup in Lake Granbury, inside which officials found Helen Holladay's skeleton . Ideal conditions: The truck was found after the lake's water level dropped thanks to Texas' ongoing drought . Ghost inn: The discovery was made behind the old and abandoned Brazos Motel . Authorities have notified Holladay’s two surviving daughters, but the results of DNA tests will likely take about two months. Deputies had responded to a call about a domestic disturbance at the Holladays' mobile home the night she went missing September 29, 1979. Witnesses reported seeing Helen Holladay leaving the house and driving away, though there was not enough evidence to charge her husband, Deeds said. The rusted out truck was discovered at around 11.30am Thursday by a Granbury city worker. NBC Dallas-Fort Worth reported the Chevy was found near the Lake Bridge on Business 377 in Granbury, its condition so badly deteriorated that officials have been unable to make out the license plate number. The truck had spent more than 30 years submerged in 15 feet of water, but the drought caused the lake levels to drop, uncovering the front and rear sections of the vehicle, according to CBS DFW. The cabin of the pickup truck contained Mrs Holladay's purse with her credit card still inside. Deeds noted . that investigators searched the lake numerous times with sonar . following Holladay's disappearance, but the murky waters and the fact . that the truck was covered in silt made it nearly impossible for divers . to spot it. But Texas' record-breaking drought has brought the lake to its lowest levels in years. Initial . inspection of the skeletal remains revealed no signs of trauma, but . detectives can't yet say whether foul play was involved in her death, . Deeds said. Before picture: Holladay's Chevy pickup truck resembled this vehicle 35 years ago when she went missing . Clues: Investigators found a purse in the cabin containing Holladay's credit card . ‘It's still too early in the investigation to rule in one direction or the other,’ he said, adding that a forensic investigator with the University of North Texas at Denton is expected to inspect the remains. Holladay's daughter, Karen Boatwright Stuart, 60, described her stepfather, Herman Holladay, as a violent and abusive man who had sent her mother to the hospital on multiple occasions. ‘I don’t know this for a fact, but I’ve always thought that Herman Holladay did something to her,’ the woman told the Star-Telegram. According to the daughter, Mrs Holladay had made several attempts to leave her husband, but every time he would force her to come back, threatening her that he would kill her and take away her property. Ms Boatwright Stuart recalled that after her mother's disappearance, her grandparents went by the Holladays' motor home and came upon a disturbing scene inside. ‘My grandmother said that blood was running down the door,’ the daughter said.","Helen Holladay, 45, was last seen alive September 29, 1979, leaving her home after a fight with her husband .

A little girl from Fort Lauderdale was able to climb into the claw machine and gain access to a pile of stuffed animals which she handed out to all who desired to claim a prize.

A little girl crawled into the claw machine to hand out stuffed animals free of charge . As soon as the image was posted, both Reddit and The Daily Dot posted stories that sparked a bit of controversy.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . With two female camels sharing a pen, the last thing you’d expect is for one to give birth. But Doris, an ‘ungulate’ with two humps, stunned staff at Mainsgill Farm near Richmond, North Yorkshire, by having a calf on Thursday. Andrew Henshaw, owner of the farm said he believed five-year-old Doris's surprise labour had been triggered by a neighbouring llama giving birth. Doris was 'stand-offish' after the birth before her mothering instinct kicked in and she bonded with the calf . Farmer owner Andrew Henshaw: 'It's a funny looking thing, and you would think it was straight out of Jurassic Park the noise it was making' The new calf, left, has yet to be named and the farm is running a competition for visitors to make suggestions . Doris and her half-sister Delilah had gained a lot of weight since arriving at the attraction last June, but Mr Henshaw had put that down to good husbandry because Doris had not displayed any signs of being pregnant. Doris had appeared normal when he checked the farm's lambs and llamas on Thursday morning, but minutes later farm worker Bob Shaw ran into the farm shop saying she was giving birth. Mr Henshaw said: 'We were absolutely gobsmacked. Everyone thinks of lambs and bunnies at Easter, nobody was thinking we would have a baby camel.' While camels are known for their stubborn and crabbish personalities, Mr Henshaw said Doris had appeared 'stand-offish' after the birth before her mothering instinct kicked in.

While the gestation period for camels can range from 12 to 15 months, camels often choose when they give birth, often opting for times when they are in a herd, so they can deliver at the same time. Doris's neighbour, a llama called Maisy, another member of the camelid family, had given birth on Tuesday and that was likely to have triggered the camel's labour. The farm, which also has llamas, alpacas, ostriches and reindeer, has set up a camel-cam on its website to show off its new arrival. It has also begun a competition to find a name for the calf.","Doris, gave birth to a calf at Mainsgill Farm in North Yorkshire .

"By . Peter Rugg . Timothy Scott Hendricks had only been out of jail a month when he took a pistol, pointed it girlfriend Michelle Marie Ploetz's head, and pulled the trigger with the couple's infant son sitting in a car seat between them. The details of that horrific Wednesday afternoon in St. Paul, Minn., are detailed in a criminal complaint filed Friday in which Hendricks is charged with second-degree intentional murder as well as second-degree attempted murder with intent for shooting at Ploetz's father. According to the criminal complaint, officers were on their way to respond to a report of a fight on White Bear Avenue and East Seventh Street Wednesday when Ploetz's father, John Ploetz, 54, called to report that his daughter had been shot and the armed gunman was on the run. Police allege Timothy Scott Hendricks shot and killed his infant son's mother, Michelle Marie Ploetz, before attempting to murder her father as well . Police found the girl with a gunshot wound to the head, unconscious but breathing in the back of a Toyota SUV. The infant, still in his car seat, was removed so paramedics could treat her. Ploetz, 20, was taken off life support on Friday. According to John Ploetz's account, as quoted in The Pioneer Press, the couple had been at dinner at The Little Oven, a restaurant roughly four blocks from the scene of the shooting. Hendricks, 19, had just been granted a conditional release from jail after a January charge for felony assault. He'd allegedly pointed a rifle at his 13-year-old nephew and pled not guilty. At the time of his January arrest, he told police he was addicted to 'pot, benzos, and opiates,' with a 'bottle-a-day' habit. The meeting at The Little Oven was for Hendricks to see the couple's baby. But both Michelle and her father were worried about the encounter, and John Ploetz came too. At one point during the meal Hendricks asked: 'Why can't this be like it always was?' However the John and Michelle told him 'he needed to take it one step at a time' and urged him to get into a treatment program for his addiction. Maybe they would get together again in a week. Michelle was in her first semester at college and suffered from a rare genetic blood disorder called Fanconi anemia . The four left together with John Ploetz behind the wheel, and the pair in the backseat with their baby. Hendricks was behind the driver's seat. Ploetz said that he heard a 'pop' from the back, followed quickly by another 'as something flew past his head breaking the car's windshield. John Ploetz believed Hendricks was trying to kill him, so he stopped the car, got out, and attempted to open the rear door and get the gun away from him. Hendricks fired at him twice more before John Ploetz fled, the father of his grandson chasing after him with a pistol. The bereaved father would later tell authorities he had attempted to have Hendricks committed on three occasions for fear of exactly this situation. The complaint read that John Ploetz 'expressed fear that Hendricks would kill the rest of his family if not apprehended or if he ever gets out of custody.' Later that day, Hendricks turned up at Regions Hospital, where he was arrested. While he . was on the run, police found an unidentified woman at his address . who told them that the troubled teen had talked about his . plan to kill Michelle a day earlier. But as he had threatened Michelle in the past . without acting the woman 'didn't think he would follow through.' He also threatened to hurt himself, promising 'he wasn't going . back to jail.' After . his arrest, Hendricks told police that the family had discussed his . son's custody arrangement at dinner and that 'despite the fact . that he is on the boy's birth certificate they wanted full custody and . he wouldn't be able to see the boy.' Michelle's father said she was nervous about seeing Hendricks and discussing visitation rights for the couple's son . He also said the gun had been in his front pocket, and he'd withdrawn it on the ride home after demanding that they stop arguing so he could see his son. Michelle Ploetz said he would never see the boy, he put the gun 'right at her head,' and fired. 'I was hearing voices in my head and I just snapped and I couldn't tell you what really happened,' he told police. When pressed he clarified that the voices 'took over' before he fired, but admitted that he himself wanted Michelle dead as he 'didn't want to lie' to police. He said he blacked out after the shooting and had no memory of firing on John Ploetz. He was placed in Ramsey County jail on suicide watch. Despite the guards, he broke his pelvis and jaw while jumping over a railing Thursday night. He went into surgery for the injuries Friday. Jennifer Hendricks, Timothy's older sister, believes the system failed her brother when he tried to get help. She told reporters that he needed to be treated in a mental health facility. 'Had Timothy got the help we were asking for, this would never have . happened,' she said. Along with her fiance, Jennifer raised Timothy and another brother after their father died in 2004. 'Timothy is not a criminal,' she said. 'He has been dealing with some . mental demons. ... We loved Michelle, we fought for Michelle, and we . fought for Timothy.' She said her . brother was taking Xanax by prescription to treat anxiety and panic . disorders when he developed an addiction. He . tried to end his dependency but failed. Jennifer said he would call her . while going  through withdrawals, crying: 'My body hurts so bad without the . drugs.' Hendricks' relatives said he suffered from a mental disorder and drug addiction and had been turned away when seeking treatment . A once promising student, Hendricks graduated from Central High School in 2013 with straight A's. He met Michelle through mutual friends in 2010 and remained 'absolutely inseparable until recently,' Jennifer said. John Ploetz and wife Dianne Ploetz released this statement mourning their daughter: 'Michelle was full of life and passions, including Korean drumming and . dance, her son, and her many friends. Michelle was a very generous . person. And in her spirit of generosity, she will be an organ donor, . giving hope to others in need.' She was also in her first semester at St. Catherine University. 'Michelle . had already overcome so much in her life, and to have such a senseless . act cut her life short, for no reason at all, has left our community . without words,' said friend Christopher Byrd. The two knew each other through a small community for adults struggling with Fanconi anemia, a rare genetic blood disorder of Fanconi anemia since Ploetz was diagnosed with at 6. Byrd said Michelle had become an inspirational figure in the group because often women with Fanconi anemia are unable to have children. 'I know that she spent every minute with her son; she loved her son so . very much,' he said, remembering how Michelle Byrd proudly displayed pictures of the boy at a meeting for adults with Fanconi anemia last . month in Baltimore.","Timothy Hendricks allegedly shot girlfriend Michelle Ploetz in the head after a dinner arguing over custody .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . An Ohio teacher has been fired after a black student who said he . wanted to become president claimed the teacher told him the nation . didn't need another black commander in chief. The Fairfield Board . of Education voted 4-0 on Thursday night to fire science teacher Gil . Voigt from Fairfield Freshman School, according to The Cincinnati . Enquirer. 'The district felt that the . evidence was sufficient to support the termination of Mr. Voigt's . employment,' Superintendent Paul Otten said in statement. Freshman science teacher Gil Voigt was fired after telling a black student that he didn't need another black president after Obama . Voigt did not immediately return a call seeking comment Friday but has said the student misquoted him. Voigt, . who is white, told school officials that what he actually told the teen . was that he doesn't think the nation can afford another president like . Barack Obama, 'whether he's black or white.' A state referee investigating Voigt found that explanation was not credible. The . referee also found Voigt had made other offensive comments in class . over the years, including an accusation that in 2008, he trained his . laser pointer at a black student and said he looked like 'an . African-American Rudolph.' Voigt told school officials that he was . only repeating what another student had said but later acknowledged his . conduct had been inappropriate. In 2012, Voigt was accused of calling a student stupid and implying that he and some of his classmates were gay. In . that incident, Voigt denied making any insulting comments to students . and told school officials that a group of students in his class were . colluding against him.

"By . Ryan Gorman . ‘He tore the cover off the ball’ is said when a baseball player hits the ball hard – but a backup catcher literally did just that Friday night in Pittsburgh. Milwaukee Brewers backstop Martin Maldonado secured his place in baseball lore when the cover came off an otherwise routine ground ball he hit during the sixth inning. Maldonado had a runner on second base when his blistering ground ball caught Pirates third baseman Pedro Alvarez by surprise, and then everyone else in the stadium. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'The ball just fell apart': The cover visibly came off the ball as it rolled towards third base . Anything but routine: Pirates third baseman Pedro Alvarez quickly looks at the unfurled ball before trying to thrw it to first base to record the out . The catcher was hustling towards first as the ball bounced towards third while the cover visibly unravelled before reaching Alvarez’s glove. Alvarez looked surprised as he fielded it, but tried to throw Madonado out at first. ‘The ball just fell apart!’ Shouted surprised Brewers television play-by-play announcer Brian Anderson. ‘I have never seen that in my entire life,’ said Brewers radio announcer Bob Uecker – in his 41st baseball season as a player or broadcaster. 'I feel like I hit it on the barrel, not on the end of the bat,' Maldonado said after the game. 'But when I looked down, I see that something was spinning. I never thought it was the ball uncovered. 'I thought he threw it to second base. Then I looked back and saw the ball and I was like, ‘That’s kind of weird.’ Your browser does not support iframes. Sure out, or not: What should have been a routine out became a baseball blooper for the ages as the ball's cover flapped in the breeze while fluttering across the field . Infield hit: Backup catcher Martin Maldonado, who hit the ball, was safe by quite a bit and was awarded a base hit . 'Just when you think you've seen it all': Pirates first baseman Gaby Sanchez shows the damaged ball to an umpire . ‘That’s a new one for me,’ Uecker continued between chuckles. ‘[Alvarez] threw it anyway, and it rolled over there like a napkin.’ ‘I’ve heard of hitting the cover off the ball, I’ve never seen it,’ Anderson continued, still in shock. ‘He literally hit the cover off the baseball,’ a Pirates announcer exclaimed. ‘just when you think you’ve seen it all… you will not see that again.’ Pirates first baseman Gaby Sanchez looked confused as the ball died about 20 feet before it reached and barely made it to his glove on a roll. Sanchez then hands the ball to an amused umpire who gives it a quick inspection before tossing it away. Pittsburgh catcher Russell Martin, in his ninth Major League season, didn’t know what to think when looking at the ball before handing it to bemused manager Clint Hurdle. Shocked veteran: Pirates catcher Russell Martin has spent almost a decade in the Major Leagues, he is clearly confused by the series of events . Announcers for both teams wondered aloud what the official scorer would rule the play – Maldonado was given a hit because he beat the throw to first base. What looks like an ordinary single in the box score is anything but. ‘You could watch a hundred thousand more games and never see that,’ said the Pirates announcer. The bizarre play led to a run later in the inning and helped power first place Brewers 5-3 past the third place pirates.","Brewers backstop Martin Maldonado's hit will go down in baseball history .

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . A 25-year-old Oregon mother has been sentenced to life in prison for the beating murder of her four-year-old son, who slowly died of severe abuse in a homeless shelter. Jessica Dutro was sentenced Friday after being convicted of killing her son Zachary Dutro-Burgess, with a Washington County jury hearing earlier this month that her motive for the murder was believing the little boy was gay. Under state law, Dutro will be eligible for parole after 25 years, according to The Oregonian. Her boyfriend, Brian Canady, was also sentenced Friday for his role in the August 2012 murder. Canady, who received a plea deal after testifying against his girlfriend, pleaded guilty to the lesser charges of first-degree manslaughter and second-degree assault. Abuser: Jessica Dutro (left) was found guilty of murdering her fouryear-old son Zachary because she thought he was gay and has been sentenced to life in prison for the crime . Jessica Dutro, 25, is charged in the death of her 4-year-old son, Zachary Dutro-Boggess in Hillsboro, Oregon, on April 1, 2014 . Too young: Zachary died in August 2012 after being beaten so severely his intestines tore, slowly causing a deadly infection . He received a sentence of 12 and a half years in prison. On August 14, 2012, Jessica Dutro and . her boyfriend called 911 to report that her son was unconscious after . collapsing at Good Neighbor Center, a family homeless shelter in which the couple lived with Dutro's three children. Little . Zachary, who just turned four the day before, was rushed to a Portland . hospital where doctors diagnosed him with blunt-force trauma to the . abdomen, which caused his bowels to tear. The . toddler was taken off the ventilator two days later. He died of . blunt-force trauma to his abdomen and delay in medical treatment, . prosecutors said. In . shocking evidence revealed in court, Dutro wrote to her boyfriend on Facebook to . tell him she feared her son was gay, using a slur: 'He walks and talks . like it. Ugh.' Canady would have to 'work on' Zachary, she wrote. Former couple: Both Dutro and her boyfriend Brian Canady, 25 (right), were charged in Zachary's death, but Canady escaped murder charges by taking a plea deal, agreeing to testify against his girlfriend . Crime scene: Zachary Dutro-Boggess was found unconscious August 14, 2012, in the homeless shelter Good Neighbor Center in Tigard, Oregon . The message established Dutro's motive for inflicting a pattern of abuse, prosecutor Megan Johnson said. Dutro assaulted all three of her children, but Zachary received the harshest treatment, authorities said. The judge ruled additional web searches done by Dutro were also admissible, The Oregonian reported. On August 16, 2012, the day her son was taken off life support, Miss Dutro searched terms such as anger management and parenting classes, prosecutors said. She also searched listings for free stuff and sex with strangers, they said. Earlier last month, Canady pleaded guilty to manslaughter and assault for his role in the homicide after agreeing to testify against Dutro as a witness for the prosecution. Admission of guilt: Brian Canady (center) pleaded guilty to manslaughter and assault earlier this month. He has now been sentenced to 12 and a half years prison . Under the plea agreement, the more serious charges against him, including four counts of murder by abuse and one count of second-degree assault, have been dropped. When questioned by detectives, the man admitted that he had kicked Zachary in the stomach because the boy wanted to take off his shoes before sitting down to watch TV, as Canady had ordered him. During a hearing last month, the jury got to hear an audio recording of an interview that detectives had conducted with Miss Dutro's 7-year-old daughter, who described how her mother and Canady allegedly hit and punched Zachary until he 'got dead.' The girl also told police that the couple often hit her and her siblings for 'not being good.' The 7-year-old recounted how her brother was repeatedly struck by his parents for not listening until he got sick. Plea deal: Canady agreed to testify against his girlfriend in exchange for the more serious charges against him being dropped. He was convicted of first-degree manslaughter and second-degree assault . The boy eventually stopped breathing, but his sister told police that Dutro and her boyfriend 'didn’t tell anybody.' On the morning of August 14, Dutro placed . Zachary in the shower because he had wet himself, but the child's body . was limp and his eyes rolled. Dr. Danny Leonhardt, who examined Zachary, testified that by the time his parents sought medical help for the toddler, he 'essentially was dead.' Leonhardt said that the contents of his torn intestines had leaked out into his body for at least two days, resulting in a deadly infection. Besides the injuries to Zachary’s abdomen similar to those seen in car crash victims, the child's body was covered in bruises suggesting prolonged, repeated abuse. Leonhardt said that in the hospital, he caught a glimpse of Zachary's 3-year-old brother and said that the child's face was covered in scrapes. An exam later showed that the toddler had five broken ribs in various stages of healing. The physician evaluated the victim’s siblings and concluded that all of them had been abused, save for Dutro and Canady's infant son.","Zachary Dutro-Boggess, 4, died in August 2012 after being beaten so severely his intestines tore .

"By . Hazel Southam . and Jonathan Petre . He is the inspiration for Hollywood film The Horse Whisperer and has been a trusted adviser to the Queen on her horses and corgis  for a quarter of a century. Now Monty Roberts is using his gift to help British soldiers returning from the front line to tackle their post-traumatic shock disorder. Monty has already pioneered his unconventional treatment with US troops at his Californian ranch. Horse whisperer Monty Roberts  is using his gift to help British soldiers returning from the front line to tackle their post-traumatic shock disorder . And at his first UK ‘clinic’ last week for 30 veterans at Tedworth House, the Wiltshire base of charity Help For Heroes, Monty shared his system of ‘Join-Up’ – communication with a horse through movement. ‘This is a silent language,’ he explained to his audience . ‘You can use this to build trust and to grow stronger. It’s phenomenal what these horses can teach you.’ Man and horse in harmony: Former paratrooper James Tattingham works with Badger the horse at Tedworth House, Help the Heroes equestrian centre in Wiltshire . Then it was the former soldiers’ turn to try moving a horse around the pen just by eye contact and clicks of the tongue. After that they had to persuade the horse to come to them and encourage it to follow them round the ring, which all of them did successfully – to their evident delight. Former paratrooper James Tattingham’s PTSD dates back to Afghanistan, when many of his friends were killed or injured. James, 27, said: ‘I had a lot of nightmares. I kept a knife in my wardrobe and I would be on watch at the window at night. I had a really bad temper too.’ Badger helps Hugh Forsyth at Tedworth House, the Wiltshire base of charity Help For Heroes . Andy Askew, 31, left the Army Air Corps last month and suffers ¿an exhausting emotional rollercoaster¿ of flashbacks to Afghanistan . After his session with a horse called Badger, he was impressed, saying it was in marked contrast to psychiatric help he had received. ‘The psychiatrist patronised me,’ he said, ‘but I felt really great doing this. I felt happy and I’m proud of myself. Monty and his team didn’t treat us like we were different – it was like they understood.’ Another to try the treatment was Andy Askew, 31, who left the Army Air Corps last month and suffers ‘an exhausting emotional rollercoaster’ of flashbacks to Afghanistan. After working with a horse called George, the former sergeant was in tears. ‘I was really emotional,’ he said. By royal appointment: Monty Robert, the horse whisperer, with the Queen at Windsor in 1989 . ‘It’s the most profound thing I have done. I’ve tried a lot of things to help with my PTSD, but that was a real surprise. ‘I loved the fact it was not just a connection with another living thing, but the fact it was complete silence. ‘I felt peaceful. And I haven’t felt peaceful for a long time.’ Monty Roberts could hardly have supporters in higher places. He told The Mail on Sunday that he discussed his initiative to help traumatised troops with the Queen just last week, and that he would love to have her grandsons, Princes William and Harry, as ambassadors. Former movie stuntman Monty first became an adviser to the Queen in 1989 after she heard about his ability to tame wild horses. He travels regularly to Britain to help train not only her horses but also the royal corgis and Prince Philip’s ponies. ‘I would love her grandsons to get involved,’ he said. ‘They are military through and through. I keep telling Her Majesty there is something very important here. She believes me about horses. ‘On the other hand she says, “The boys have their own lives and I can’t get them to answer the phone!” ’","Monty Roberts has been working for Her Majesty since 1989 .

Wing suit flying enthusiast Mark Sutton was killed at Trient, near Lake Geneva, on August 14 2013. The 42-year-old appeared on television screens across the world when he parachuted into the Olympic opening ceremony as James Bond with a fellow stuntman playing the Queen. Scroll down for video . Mark Sutton parachuted into the Olympic opening ceremony with another stuntman playing the Queen . In a tribute paid days after his death Danny Boyle, who directed the Olympic opening ceremony, described him as a 'gentle and thoughtful' man . An inquest into his tragic death at Loughborough Coroner's Court on Thursday heard that the former Army officer crashed into a mountain ridge at high speed. Trevor Kirkman, senior coroner for Rutland and North Leicestershire, said: 'The circumstances of Mr Sutton's death were fully investigated in Switzerland. 'But following repatriation of his body, a post-mortem examination was undertaken at Leicester Royal Infirmary.' Home Office pathologist professor Guy Rutty, in a report read at Thursday's hearing, gave the medical cause of death as a 'head injury sustained while wing suit flying'. Wing suit flyers wear suits designed to allow them to glide at high speed before a parachute is opened for landing. The coroner said: 'Mr Sutton had jumped from a helicopter wearing a wing suit, camera and parachute. He crashed into a mountain range at a speed of about 150mph. Mark Sutton (L) was an experienced parachutists. The coroner said: 'Many people have had great pleasure in watching what he used to do most expertly' Mr Sutton's girlfriend Victoria Homewood paid tribute to Mr Sutton last year describing him as a man who brought 'joy and laughter to millions' 'He took the full force of the impact on his head, resulting - without doubt in Professor Rutty's opinion - in instantaneous death.' Mr Kirkham referred to a report from the Swiss accident investigation. 'It tells me Mr Sutton was well used to making jumps of this nature,' he said. 'He was making his first jump of the day. Video footage showed him approaching the crest of a hill. 'He crossed the crest line of that hill, but there was a second crest and, due to a lack of height, had hit the rocks just before the second crest.' Mark Sutton gives the thumbs up before jumping from the aircraft during his final flight . He looks out onto the scenery before making the jump . Mr Sutton is pictured making his initial descent from the aircraft. Moments later the father-of-two was tragically killed . Mr Sutton was killed when taking part int the three-day HeliBASE event. The event, which featured 23 of the world's best wing suit flyers was filmed for extreme sports broadcaster Epic TV (video below). Recording his verdict, Mr Kirkham said: 'It is quite clear this was a tragic accident. 'I would like to express my sincere condolences to all of Mark Sutton's family. 'Many people have had great pleasure in watching what he used to do most expertly.' Mr Sutton was a former pupil of Oakham School in Rutland. In the school's magazine, he had described playing the part of James Bond, as a stuntman, as his 'boyhood fantasy'. He had learned to skydive while serving with the Gurkhas in Hong Kong and had taken up base-jumping in 2005. In tributes paid earlier Danny Boyle, who directed the Olympic opening ceremony, described him as a 'gentle and thoughtful' man. 'The show was built from so many contributions from so many people, none finer and braver than Mark Sutton's.' Lord Coe, who chaired the committee that organised London 2012, described him as a 'consummate professional and team player'. Lord Coe, who chaired the committee that organised London 2012, described Mr Sutton as a 'consummate professional and team player' Mr Sutton is pictured two months earlier preparing for the wingsuit event in Switzerland . The HeliBASE team published the Epic TV footage of the day Mark Sutton died in his memory. In the clip, his friend and flying partner Tony Uragello, who flew down behind Mr Sutton in the final moments of his life, said that he would retire from the sport, despite being the founder of Tony Suits a wingsuit company. Mr Sutton's girlfriend paid tribute to her boyfriend last year describing him as a man who brought 'joy and laughter to millions'. Victoria Homewood said his death had left a void that could not be filled, but said his 'passion, spirit, bravery and love will live on to inspire us all.' Modern wing suits, also known as birdman suits, were first developed during the 1990s and allow jumpers to cover huge amounts of ground at speeds well over 200mph. The practice uses a special jumpsuit with webbing between the limbs to add surface area to the body and give it lift to enable to wearer to glide towards the ground. The wingsuiter uses their body to control forward speed, direction and lift.  As they approach the ground that is when a wingsuiter will deploy a parachute. According to wingsuitcity.com, it is generally accepted that wing suiting adds a degree of complexity to skydiving, with risks such as uncontrollable spinning, hitting an aircraft's tail on exit and extra material to manage.","Mark Sutton, 42, died in August 14 during an accident in Switzerland .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . A musician selling a charity calendar claims he is struggling to offload the remaining copies - because he put expenses scandal MP Maria Miller on the front. Singer Brian James from Basingstoke, Hampshire, created the five pound calendars putting Mrs Miller in pride of place on the front page. Mr James created the calendars  - which feature buskers pictured with people in the public eye - to raise money for BBC's Children in Need. Singer Brian James - who claims no-one will buy his charity calendar because Maria Miller MP is on the front cover. He is now planning on emailing the MP and asking for a donation . But having raised £1,100 by selling 220 copies sales have stopped since the MP's expenses scandal. Mr James believes anger in the town towards the MP has hampered his attempts to sell the remaining load. He is even considering emailing her for £250, the cost of the remaining calenders, as he can't shift them. Maria Miller reads an apology statement in the House of Commons in London over her parliamentary expenses. She stepped down from her role shortly afterwards . He said: 'It was going so well. I wish I had never put her on the front now. 'The public won't buy it because she is on the front, and it is a bit annoying really. No-one will buy them. 'I will be emailing her and I will be asking for £250 because I am stuck with them.' The Conservative MP resigned from her Cabinet position as Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport on April 9. Her decision to step down came after it was revealed she over-claimed mortgage payments on her second home in Wimbledon, south London. She was told to repay £5,800 by the Parliamentary Committee on Standards - despite Parliamentary Commissioner Kathryn Hudson originally recommending she pay back £45,800. There had been mounting pressure for the MP to resign from Labour and Conservative politicians alike. At the time, she said the row had been an 'enormous distraction' from 'the incredible achievements of this government'. Conservative MP Sajid Javid was named as the new culture secretary, while Mrs Miller remains the member of parliament for Basingstoke.","Singer Brian James created calendar with Maria Miller on the front .

"By . Valerie Elliott . Curry sauces from restaurants across the country are being urgently tested after three deaths were linked to an allergic reaction from peanuts in takeaways. Safety chiefs fear a new food scandal with fraudsters adulterating expensive almond powder used to thicken sauces with cheap ground peanuts – a move which can prove fatal if the meal is eaten by someone suffering from a peanut allergy. The Mail on Sunday has learned a criminal investigation is under way into the death of the latest victim – pub manager Paul Wilson, 38, from Helperby, near Thirsk, North Yorkshire. Police last week arrested two men, aged 38 and 51, in connection with his death. They have since been released on bail. Curry sauces from restaurants across the country are being tested after three deaths were linked to an allergic reaction to peanuts in curry (file picture) Connor Donaldson, 12, from Tyldesley, Greater Manchester, and Derek Stephenson, 32, a gardener from Stanhope, Co ­Durham, have also died in separate cases. Some people suffer an allergic reaction if they eat any type of nut, but others can safely eat almonds and pistachios grown on trees and are only affected by peanuts – also known as ground nuts – grown in soil. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has ordered councils to encourage restaurant owners to check their ingredients. New rules come into effect in December which will make the labelling of possible food allergens compulsory. ‘We expect action to be taken against any businesses responsible for deliberately selling adulterated products,’ said the FSA. Almond prices have doubled in a year and food chiefs believe cheaper ground peanuts are being added to almond powder, and some takeaway owners are using peanuts to save money. Some people suffer an allergic reaction if they eat any type of nut, while some are only affected by peanuts . Corrine Lowe, of the Trading Standards Institute, said: ‘Almond powder is being substituted with ground nut powder. ‘In some cases outlets are being incorrectly supplied. In others, they are buying the cheaper ground nut, and still describe meals as containing almond.’ Hazel Gowland, of the Anaphylaxis Campaign, said: ‘Cases linked to takeaways are becoming more common and something in the food chain has changed. ‘There are people who have eaten the same takeaway every week for years who were fine, but who have now died.’ Schoolboy Connor died after eating a prawn balti which staff at the restaurant said did not contain nuts. Tests carried out by Wigan Council later found the almond powder used was adulterated and bulked up with at least 50 per cent peanut powder. A council spokesman said that an investigation was continuing.

"By . Duncan Farmer . Since setting up his interior design business in 1971, Christopher Vane Percy has worked on some of Britain’s most iconic institutions, including the Garrick Club and Mayfair’s Connaught Hotel. As well as being involved in such prestigious projects, Christopher, a past president  of the British Institute of Interior Design, also made his own furniture. In 1979, needing a studio to produce his pieces, he bought a former Unigate dairy  in North Kensington, a stone’s-throw from  Ladbroke Grove and the fashionable Portobello Road market, for £90,000 and set up his own workshop. Maxim Vane Percy and his wife Lisette are selling not one, but two, flats in the old dairy in Kensington . It proved to be an astute buy. In 1995, Christopher no longer needed the workspace (partly because most of his one-off pieces were being copied), so he sold a portion of  the land for development and then spent £2million converting the dairy into seven live/work units and a maisonette. He gave three properties to his children – and today his son Maxim is selling a three-bedroom, two-storey apartment, which comes complete with a roof terrace, and a one-bedroom flat for a total of £3.5million. The cul-de-sac in which the apartments are set contains a mixture of Victorian terrace houses and businesses – the old post office sorting office has since been converted into offices and studios, and an undertaker’s remains where it has been since 1937. The three-bedroom apartment is, naturally, beautifully designed, although elegantly simple and retains its industrial character. Maxim, a director of a property business that manages the £4.5billion Berkeley Square Estate in Central London, bought the top  floor, which had been a studio, from his sister Tryce, and set about amalgamating it with  the flat below. Family flats: Maxim's father, designer Christopher Vane Percy,  bought the ex-Unigate dairy in 1979 and converted it into flats and studios in 1995 . ‘Because we owned the building we didn’t have to do all the work at once,’ says Maxim – the couple finished the top-floor kitchen and sitting room only two years ago. But their hard work was worth the wait, and the result is a stunning loft-like space with a vaulted ceiling and a vast skylight that floods the room with light. ‘We never put the lights on,’ says Maxim’s wife Lisette, 35, who runs a fashion business, pretaportobello.com, which showcases the couture of stallholders at Portobello and London markets. The open-plan room also gives a view of the campanile at nearby St Charles Hospital. ‘When my father bought the dairy it wasn’t listed, so he could have flattened it, but because he has a great interest in architecture he treated it like a listed building,’ says Maxim. ‘This part was the offices and  all he did was gentrify it.’ But not by much. The beauty of the apartment is that it has space, light and an impressive utility. The walls are hung with modern art – a Banksy, a Miranda Donovan and an intriguing work by James Hart Dyke, who followed MI6 spooks for a year, painting their interviews with contacts for a project to mark the 50th anniversary of James Bond. A huge marble worktop in the kitchen reflects the building’s heritage. ‘In a dairy they would have used marble not because it’s easy to clean but because it’s cool,’ says Maxim. Mr Vane Percy is selling a three-bedroom, two-storey apartment, which comes complete with a roof terrace, and a one-bedroom flat for a total of £3.5million . The Vane Percys in the kitchen in the three-bedroom flat in the old diary, located in North Kensington, London . Brickwork beside the staircase is exposed, and the electric wiring is covered by aluminium scavenged from a decommissioned ship in India, while the huge pendant lights from the high ceiling in the hall came from a Vauxhall car factory. Light and space are the key to this building – even the cloakroom has a view (out but not in) and the cupboards are designed to provide storage, but not at the expense of masking light or interrupting the flat’s flow. The kitchen/reception is 32ft long and even the couple’s dressing room is the size of most double bedrooms. ‘We could have crammed in another bedroom but, for me, circulation space is so important,’ says Maxim, who points out  that, with the flat below their apartment being part of the sale, the two could be knocked together into a house. Alternatively, the smaller flat could be kept as an investment opportunity. So why sell? ‘We’re a young family and  we want more children. The roof terrace is great but it’s not a garden,’ says Lisette. Although Maxim admits that he’s not artistic, he made one key decision that has had a great impact on the property’s value. ‘When Dad developed the dairy, he did live/work units, but the problem is that it’s  not great for residential values, so we changed its status  to residential. ‘Not only is it very hard to get a mortgage on part-commercial and residential property, but you also have to pay business rates, which are expensive,’ he says.

"By . Jennifer Newton . Prisoners are to be taught how to make the perfect cup of coffee in a bid to help them find work when they leave jail. Next month inmates at Brixton Prison in south London will learn how to use coffee grinders, pull a shot of espresso and the art of milk steaming in a barista training project. They will also be taught skills like handling cash, as well as charm and politeness and the need to be welcoming to customers. Inmates at Brixton Prison (pictured) are to learn barista skills to gain hospitality experience . The coffee will then be sold in the prison's cafe, which is open to the public four days a week in the visitors' hall. The prison already runs the Bad Boys' Bakery, which was set up by TV chef Gordon Ramsay to give inmates the chance to develop their cooking skills as well as gain work experience and responsibility. Inmates bake a range of goods which are sold at the Lower Marsh Saturday market next to Waterloo Station. Gordon Ramsay helped set up the Bad Boys' Bakery at Brixton Prison for the programme, Gordon Behind Bars . Both schemes are run by the National Offender Management Service, with the aim of offering skills and training for inmates. And with a reported skills shortage in the hospitality industry, it is believed teaching prisoners how to make coffee will boost their chances of finding a job.

One of the prisoners in the project, Ian Hughes, 34, also told the newspaper: 'I started learning how to make cakes and stuff. It is great to make a product, finish it off and know it is going to be sold and you hope people like it.

"By . Alex Hawkes . He has praised the BBC for being ‘really nice to him’. But Paul Flowers’ ‘cosy’ interview with Newsnight’s Jeremy Paxman looks set to come back to haunt him. The former Co-op Bank boss’s decision to talk publicly about his dismissal on TV is understood to have breached the terms of his £95,000 pay-off with the Co-operative Group, which is now trying to claw back the cash. The ex-Methodist minister agreed to the pay-off – divided into three instalments of just over £30,00 each – after stepping down from the ailing bank in last June. Paul Flowers branded the media 'vultures', except for the BBC who he said had been 'very nice' to him . However, following The Mail on Sunday’s revelations about his drug habit – which breached a separate clause requiring Flowers not to bring the firm into disrepute – the supermarket and funeral care group withheld two payments, and asked for the first sum of £31,000 to be handed back. It is understood that the Newsnight breach will give the group further grounds to recoup its money. Before being charged with three drugs offences last Wednesday, Flowers told waiting journalists: ‘The BBC has been really nice to me but the rest of you are vultures.’ The reference is understood to relate to the Newsnight interview, which was widely criticised for being too soft.

Jeremy Paxman faced criticism after the programme for the interview being 'soft'. A claim the BBC denies . During the programme, Mr Paxman failed to press Flowers on his drug habit or his taste for rent boys, and allowed him to explain away his behaviour as a response to the death of his mother. Flowers also claimed the MoS’s revelations were ‘pure and utter fiction’. Despite this, he has not complained to this paper or issued legal action. During the show, Flowers – who has yet to respond to the Co-op’s requests – claimed the group had not been in touch with him since his departure. A source said this was untrue: ‘We’ve asked him for the money back.’ The BBC insists Mr Paxman ‘conducted a revealing and thorough interview’.

The eggs – a long-standing Easter treat – are dipped in batter and then put in boiling fat for between 30 and 40 seconds to ensure the yolk warms up, but the chocolate doesn’t completely melt. Surprisingly, perhaps, the chip shop that came up with the snack says it is doing a roaring trade. The eggs are covered in batter and then deep-fried to up to 40 seconds.

Stuart Farquhar, 87, is believed to have been attempting a three-point turn when he fell into the freezing North Sea on Friday morning. He was pulled from the water at Pennan, near Aberdeen, and airlifted to hospital. But police today confirmed that the man had died. Injured: The victim is transferred from an ambulance to an helicopter to be flow from Pennan, where he fell into the sea, to Aberdeen Royal Infermary . The man was strapped into the scooter when he fell into the icy water at Pennan in Aberdeenshire. Shocked locals leapt into action when they saw him plunge over the edge shortly before 11am. They managed to haul the man to safety and kept him calm until a rescue team arrived at the scene. The RAF Sea King Rescue 137 was scrambled and he was flown to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for treatment. The extent of his injuries are not yet clear. It is not known whether the disabled man had travelled to the village as a tourist or if he lives nearby. Thousands of film fans flock to the tiny fishing hamlet every year to see the spot immortalisted in the cult classic Local Hero. The whitewashed strip of houses known as Pennan became instantly recognisable after its starring role in Bill Forsyth's 1983 movie. Airlifted: The victim is taken by an air ambulance helicopter from Pennan, where he fell off a pier . The film follows a David and Goliath struggle between a US petro petro-chemical giant and the sleepy seaside village - which was renamed Ferness for the silverscreen.

The pub still serves old ales, the iconic red phone box still works and life goes at a slightly slower pace than the outside world.

"By . Emma Glanfield . Jason Scotland-Williams, 34, completed the marathon in just over three hours - knocking more than four hours off his time last year of seven hours 24 minutes . A London Marathon runner - who completed the second half of the race quicker than Olympic champion Mo Farah - is under investigation following claims he jumped over a barrier to slash 10 miles from the route. Jason Scotland-Williams, 34, completed this year’s marathon in three hours eight minutes - knocking more than four hours off his time last year of seven hours 24 minutes. The aspiring model, from Hammersmith, London, ran the first half of the marathon in two hours and seven minutes – an average time for an amateur athlete. However, he ran the second half of the race in just one hour and one minute – quicker than Olympic hero Mo Farah who completed the same stretch in one hour and five minutes. It means Scotland-Williams finished the race in an impressive three hours and eight minutes – putting him in the top six per cent of competitors. However, online forums are awash with claims the runner cheated his way to the super-fast time, with some speculating he jumped over a waist-high barrier at the halfway point at Tower Bridge. It is alleged he jumped the barrier separating the 13-mile marker from the 22-mile point and hid in the crowds while runners looped round Canary Wharf and doubled back. It is claimed he then jumped back into the race, joining a leading group of runners, and sprinted his way to the finish. The official London Marathon website logs his progress around the first half of the course, giving updates for every 5kms he completed. However, it only gives estimated times at the 25km, 30km and 35km markers – which has prompted critics to believe he either cheated his way to the finish by dodging those checkpoints or that his chip failed to activate at those points. Jason Scotland-Williams, 34, above, from Hammersmith, London, faces claims he cheated after completing the second half of the marathon in one hour and one minute - quicker than Olympic champion Mo Farah . London Marathon organisers are investigating Jason Scotland-Williams' time after he ran the second half of the race in just over an hour. Internet forums are awash with claims he jumped over a barrier in the Tower Bridge area . Jason Scotland-Williams' result suggests he ran the second half of the race in just one hour and one minute – quicker than Olympic champion Mo Farah, above,  who completed the same stretch in one hour five minutes . However, his chip was working as he passed the 40km point and the finish line – which reveals he completed the last 13 miles in just one hour and one minute. Forum users have questioned the runner’s speedy time, suggesting it would have been a ‘miracle’ if he managed to complete the second half of the race in such a short space of time. One user, Chris Pearson, posted on a forum on Runners World: ‘First half seems fair enough.  Second half is nothing short of a miracle. ‘It is possible that he ran easy for the first half, then went all out in the second half. ‘However, it would need a chip malfunction at 25, 30, and 35k for this to have happened. ‘It would also mean that he is capable of running a half at just over 60 minute pace, which again is possible if he was a World class elite runner, but certainly not after doing a 13.1 mile warm up.’ Scotland-Williams had posted numerous photos on his Facebook profile of him wearing his marathon medals and showing off his supposed athletic ability. However, the page was closed down this morning . Results on the London Marathon's official website show Jason Scotland-Williams completed the race in three hours eight minutes. However, they also show estimated times were given at the 25K, 30K and 35K markers . Another user, Millsy1977 - a fellow marathon runner - said: ‘If it was legit he would have sped past me on Birdcage walk. I know I was tired but I think I'd have noticed someone 4.30 miling.’ Another marathon runner, Darryl Morris, said: ‘I saw Jason just after Tower Bridge and he was absolutely smashing it’, before adding: ‘Just noted the barrier skip … that would make complete sense as to why I saw him there, looking so fresh!’ And Ryan T said: ‘If he did cheat then I think a ban is in order, I worked very hard for my time this year, did a sub 3:30 for my first marathon and went through a lot of pain in the last three miles, if people are skipping out miles then shame on them!’ Virgin Money London Marathon confirmed Scotland-Williams’ results were being investigated. A spokesman told The Sun: ‘We have anti-cheating measures during the event, and then post-event when we analyse split times from points around the course. ‘Runners found to have cheated are removed from results and banned from future events.’ Jason Scotland-Williams, 34, completed this year's marathon in just over three hours - knocking more than four hours off his time last year of seven hours 24 minutes . Scotland-Williams, who wore a V for Vendetta mask during last weekend’s race, has taken part in the London Marathon for the last six years. He had posted numerous photos on his Facebook profile of him wearing his marathon medals and showing off his supposed athletic ability. However, his profile was removed from the social-networking site this morning. This year he was running to raise money for deaf-blind charity Sense. A spokesman for the charity said: ‘An allegation that a runner cheated at the London Marathon has been brought to our attention. ‘We are urgently investigating and would be very disappointed if this was true.’ The Sun reported it tried to contact Scotland-Williams but was told to ‘f*** off’. MailOnline has contacted Virgin Money London Marathon for a comment but organisers have not yet responded. Anthony Gaskell was stripped of his 'fastest pensioner' title after admitting that he took a short cut during the 2010 London Marathon . Jason Stockland-Williams is not the first competitor to be accused of cheating in the London Marathon. In 2010, Anthony Gaskell, 69, crossed the finishing line in a mere three hours and five minutes – throwing himself into the record books as the fastest time ever recorded by anyone over 65. He was due to receive a plaque marking his achievement until analysis of the race revealed he must have completed the second half in under an hour - a pace that even the world record holder could not match. Six weeks after the event, Mr Gaskell was stripped of his 'fastest pensioner' title after admitting that he took a short cut. He used a part of the course just after Tower Bridge - where the marathon doubles back on itself - to cut from the outward leg to the home leg, taking around ten miles off the course. At the time, the grandfather from Wirral, Merseyside, said: 'I have been called a cheat and disqualified from a race I never claimed to have won.' He claimed he was injured after falling over a runner ahead of him who had tripped on a safety barrier and said: 'I couldn't possibly continue.' He insists he never claimed to have run the last part of the course and that he did not try to pass off the winning time as his own. In 2011, a runner was disqualified from the 20-mile Kielder Marathon in Northumberland after catching a bus for the most of the last six miles. Rob Sloan flagged down a bus and was driven the six miles to the race’s closing stages. Rob Sloan was disqualified from the 20-mile Kielder Marathon in Northumberland in 2011 after catching a bus for most of the last six miles . He then jumped off, hid behind a tree until other competitors came into view and re-joined the race, crossing the finishing line in two hours, 51 minutes and one second to secure third place. He went on to tell a TV crew that he had given the race everything he could. However, inevitably, the truth came out and Mr Sloan was stripped of his medal and disqualified from the race. Race officials said Mr Sloan had admitted cheating.","Jason Scotland-Williams completed race in three hours eight minutes .

Jess, 12, proudly carries the fluffy yellow bundles in an egg basket around the Devon farmyard where she lives, making sure they stay safe. And when one of them decides to go walkabout, Jess offers a warm paw for it to rest on. Jess’s concern for the new arrivals came as no surprise to her owner Louise Moorhouse, who keeps sheep on the 180-acre farm near Exeter, as the dog also helps out with her new lambs, taking them bottles of milk.

A teenager was feared dead after she was 'flung like a rag doll' from a moving fairground ride and thrown 15ft to the ground at a seaside resort – but miraculously she survived the terrifying incident. Beth Thorpe, 18, was thrown out of her seat on the ‘Rocker’ ride and hurled towards the ground – landing on her head - at a temporary fair on Worthing seafront, West Sussex. Horrified witnesses feared the student, who is from the seaside resort, had died after seeing her plummet to the ground. Student Beth Thorpe, 18, was thrown out of her seat on the 'Rocker' ride and hurled towards the ground - landing on her head - at a temporary fair on Worthing seafront, West Sussex . The 18-year-old, from Worthing, West Sussex, was stretchered from the fairground after being thrown from the moving 'Rocker' ride at around 9.30pm on Thursday night .

Her mother Marilyn Vaughan said she initially feared her daughter was dead when Sussex Police broke the news on Thursday night. She said: ‘It was awful when the police told us what happened. She can't remember anything and is very shaken up.’ Her father Robert Thorpe said the incident had been traumatic for the family but confirmed his daughter was now recovering at home. He said: 'It was really traumatic. I could have lost my child. 'The way she was when I saw her in hospital was awful. It didn't look good.

Her aunt Anne Pilbean added: ‘It was an absolute nightmare.’ Faith Paine, 18, who went to school with Miss Thorpe, was on the ride when the incident happened at around 9.30pm. Miss Paine, from Worthing, said: ‘Seconds after the ride started she was flung about like a rag doll and started foaming at the mouth, immediately I knew something was wrong. ‘She then started to come up out of her seat as her body turned to jelly and just slipped out. ‘I was trying to scream stop and help but it was too late. ‘She came straight out of the seat as the “Rocker” ride went up and then plummeted downwards and landed on her head and back, hitting her ankle on the way.

She had dropped from the highest point and banged her head and ankle on the metal' ‘It was without a doubt the most horrific thing I have ever seen in my life and I am shocked she's even alive. ‘It will stay with me forever.’ Miss Paine called the ambulance and put her hand behind her friend’s head - which was covered in blood.

"By . Chris Hastings, Arts Correspondent . It is, perhaps, the best loved game show in Britain’s TV history – fondly remembered by millions for its cheesy catchphrases and conveyor belt of less-than-thrilling prizes. At its peak in the late 1970s, The Generation Game pulled in an astonishing 20 million viewers every Saturday evening, first with Bruce Forsyth at the helm and then Larry Grayson. And now the show is set to make a remarkable return .  .  . with comedienne Miranda Hart taking on the role of presenter. The BBC plans to screen the new version within a year, and a pilot episode is already taking shape, The Mail on Sunday understands. Good game, good game: Miranda recreates Bruce Forsyth's legendary pose in an interview last year . ‘Everyone is excited about this happening,’ said a BBC source who asked not to be named. ‘Miranda is a great fan of the original show and she has made no secret of her admiration for Sir Bruce Forsyth, the show’s very first host. Miranda and The Generation Game could be a match made in telly heaven.’ Hart, 41, who has established herself as one of the most popular  family entertainers in Britain with her sitcom Miranda and her role in hit drama Call The Midwife, will become the first female host of The Generation Game. BBC bosses say the idea is at the early stages and nothing has been formally confirmed, but they believe the combination of the show’s format and Hart’s family-friendly persona will prove ratings gold. The star herself is a huge fan of the show and sang its praises in an interview she did with Forsyth last year. She said: ‘Bruce is too modest to say this but I am going to say it for him. During the 1970s the Generation Game was getting over 20 million viewers every week and my family were among them. I loved it. It is one of the greatest game shows ever.’ She even defended the programme when Forsyth himself said it might now be considered ‘old hat’. Bruce Forsyth, right, and Anthea Redfern, centre, in action on the show. At its peak in the late 70s it pulled in 20million viewers a week . The show’s format involved couples of family members competing against each other in a series of challenges. Typically the couples comprised family members who were a generation apart, such as mother and son. The new Generation Game is likely to be tweaked to make it relevant for a modern audience but insiders expect all the classic ingredients to remain the same. It is not known who will be Hart’s co-host and whether the job will go to a man or a woman. One of hostesses in the original show, Anthea Redfern, famously had an affair with Forsyth and married him in 1973 before divorcing him six years later. The BBC hopes the new version will prove as popular as Strictly Comes Dancing, which pulls in more than 11 million viewers. A BBC spokesman said: ‘It’s in the early ideas stage at the moment and nothing is confirmed, but it’s an idea we are discussing with Miranda.’ Family affair: Bruce and Anthea in 1973 . The Generation Game was based on the successful Dutch show Een van de acht or One Of The Eight. An overnight hit when it launched on BBC1 in 1971, the programme initially ran until 1982. However, it was successfully revived in 1990 and remained on TV until 2002. Sir Bruce Forsyth, who hosted the programme between 1971 and 1977 and again between 1990 and 1994, was the show’s most famous presenter. He was succeeded the first time he left by camp comic Larry Grayson who presented the show from 1978 to 1982 and then Jim Davidson between 1995 and 2002. Each of stars was assisted by a glamorous hostess who was often referred to as ‘Girl Friday’ in the politically incorrect 1970s. Sir Bruce married and divorced his first hostess, Anthea Redfern, and was joined by Rosemarie Ford in 1990. Grayson and his presenting partner Isla St Clair proved to be a popular double act and Davidson had a succession of hostesses, including Sally Meen, Melanie Stace and Lea Kristensen. Each of the hosts had their own catchphrases, many of which endure  to this day. Forsyth’s best known lines included ‘Didn’t they do well?’, ‘Nice to see you, to see you, nice!’, and ‘Give us a twirl’. Grayson’s offerings included ‘Shut that door’ and ‘What a gay day’. The show’s format remained largely unchanged over the years. One of the most popular rounds involved competing couples watching a skilled professional construct something such as pottery or perform a tricky dancing routine. They would then attempt to do the same thing, often with disastrous results. Best remembered, however, is the ‘conveyor belt’ finale. One half of the victorious team – or in later shows, both members – would sit behind the conveyor belt as a string of prizes passed before them, always including a cuddly toy. They would win all those they could recall within a set period of time.","Popular game show set to be relaunched by the BBC .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby (pictured in Kent on Friday) has suggested he cannot allow the blessing of gay marriages because it would split the global Anglican Church . The Archbishop of Canterbury has suggested that he cannot allow the blessing of gay marriages because it would split the global Anglican Church. Although sympathetic to calls for the Church to honour same-sex relationships in public, the Most Rev Justin Welby said it was ‘impossible’ for some worshippers in Africa to support homosexuality. Speaking after the introduction last month of gay marriage in England and Wales by the Government, the Archbishop said that the Church, which has 77 million followers globally, must not take a step that would cut these groups off. ‘I do believe passionately that unity is something we have to maintain,’ he told The Daily Telegraph as the Church embarks on a consultation into the introduction of informal blessing-like services. ‘I may be wrong, but I also believe that to take a step that means that people who desperately need our help – and who we can help – can’t take it, feel in their own culture that it is impossible to be helped by us, is something that we can’t easily do.’ He said the Church must listen to the world’s ‘victims of oppression and poverty’ who ‘find that issue an almost impossible one to deal with’. He added: ‘How do you hold those two things [in balance] and do what is right and just by all?’ The Archbishop said he visited the scene of a massacre of Christians in South Sudan and had been told by religious leaders that they would not accept the Anglican Church’s help in future if blessings of gay marriage were allowed. The Archbishop insisted he was not giving into ‘moral blackmail’ but could not easily take a decision that would cause further deep rifts within the Church. But the Bishop of Buckingham, the Rt Rev Alan Wilson, said it was ‘wrong’ to relate gay marriage in the West to ‘warlords and people who practise genocide in central Africa’.

He said he was trying to entertain the other passengers and was making ‘fun and jokes’. Two flight attendants told the court that they saw Manselius walking towards the cockpit.

"By . Dan Bloom . The mother of murdered schoolboy Rhys Jones has slammed a decision to release the gangster who supplied his murder weapon - leaving just one of the seven-strong gang in prison. Rhys was just 11 when he was gunned down by 16-year-old Sean Mercer, aided by six others, on his way home from football practice in Croxteth, Liverpool, in 2007. But James Yates - who supplied the First World War Smith & Wesson revolver used to kill the child - has walked free from jail this month to the outrage of Rhys' family. 'Horrendous': James Yates (left) was one of seven people jailed over their involvement in the murder of schoolboy Rhys Jones (right) but he has now been released, leaving only murderer Sean Mercer behind bars . Murder weapon: Yates supplied the First World War Smith & Wesson revolver used to kill Rhys Jones . It means only Mercer, who was jailed for life with a minimum of 22 years, is left behind bars after seven people were convicted over their involvement in the horrific crime. Nathan Quinn, Dean Kelly, Gary Kays, Melvin Coy and a 16-year-old who could not be named have all served their sentences. Rhys' mother Melanie told the Daily Mirror: 'It's terrible. It takes us back to the night Rhys died. It seems like only yesterday that Yates was sent to jail. 'He may not have pulled the trigger, but he was minding the gun. For us, Yates is the most evil of them all. He makes my skin crawl.' Yates was 21 when he was jailed for just seven years for supplying the gun used to kill Rhys and helping Mercer cover his tracks. He and two other members of the Croxteth Crew - Quinn, 18, and Kelly, 17 - winked, smiled, smirked and cheered in the bulletproof dock as they were handed sentences blasted as 'disgusting' by Rhys' family. Rhys' mother Melanie, pictured left with his father Stephen, attacked the decision to release Yates . The trial judge, Mr Justice Irwin, told Yates: 'There is strong evidence you were an active gang member 'I have no doubt you were a willing assistant helping in any way you could.' Yates' term was later increased to 12 years by the Lord Chief Justice, who attacked the 'modern pestilence' of gun crime. But because Yates spent almost a year in prison awaiting trial, that time counted towards his final sentence. Baby-faced killer: Sean Mercer was jailed for life with a minimum of 22 years . That means he has spent just over five years behind bars since being found guilty of assisting the schoolboy's murderer. He has been released on licence midway through his sentence, as is commonplace, and will be monitored outside prison for the remainder of the 12 years. Rhys died on August 22, 2007, when Mercer, armed with a revolver, cycled to his estate to try to shoot members of the rival Strand Gang. Rhys was struck by his second bullet, suffering terrible injuries. The 'wall of silence' faced by police meant that while Mercer's name swiftly emerged as the prime suspect in the shooting, months of painstaking detective work was required to charge him with murder. The gun itself, a .455 calibre Smith and Wesson revolver with a six-inch barrel, may have been handed down through generations of Liverpool criminals. It was made during the First World War in about 1915, but remained in good working order. The rifling in the barrel was worn and the bullets fired by Mercer were slightly undersized, causing them to tumble end-over-end. That meant the round which hit Rhys was side-on when it struck him in the back of the neck, splintering vertebrae and destroying his windpipe before exiting through his throat. The Croxeth Crew also had an imitation Walther PPK converted to fire live rounds, a British Army Webley revolver and a Russian 7.62 handgun. Murdered: Everton fan Rhys, 11, was gunned down on his was home from football practice in Liverpool . A probation service spokesman told MailOnline he would not comment on individual cases. He added: 'Public protection is our priority. Serious offenders on licence are subject to strict conditions and can be recalled to prison if they breach them. 'When released from prison, offenders managed through Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) will be risk assessed, monitored and supervised by probation, police and other agencies.'","James Yates spent just six years in jail including his time on remand .

"By . Ap Reporter . A Missouri man who avoided prison because of a clerical error and led a law-abiding life for 13 years said he is overwhelmed by the support he's received since the story of his incarceration became public. Meanwhile, the Missouri attorney general signaled that he would look for a way to take Cornealious 'Mike' Anderson's many years of clean living into account in attempting to resolve the 'difficult situation'. Anderson, who was convicted in 2000 of armed robbery for holding up a restaurant manager in suburban St. Louis, said he was cheered by inmates and guards at the Southeast Correctional Center in Charleston after his story appeared this week in news accounts. An online petition urging his release has collected nearly 30,000 signatures, and one of Anderson's attorneys said Friday that the office has been flooded with calls from people who feel he has been wronged. 13 years late: Mike Anderson is currently nine months into a 13-year prison sentence for a crime committed in 1999. He has been overwhelmed by the public support that has showered him since the story became public . Cornealious Anderson was convicted of armed robbery in 2000, sentenced to 13 years in jail and told to await instruction on when to report to prison. Those instructions never came and he went on about his life until the clerical error was caught in 2013 . 'It's a little overwhelming and embarrassing to me, but I can't thank people enough,' Anderson said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. 'Everybody here has been positive, the prisoners and the correctional officers. I've had other prisoners tell me it gives them hope.' Anderson, who had never been convicted of a serious crime, was sentenced to 13 years. Authorities told him to wait for orders that would specify when and where he was to report to prison. But the orders never came, so he didn't go. Anderson suspected that his case had been overlooked and asked his former attorney what to do. 'He said it's a mistake, and they're going to figure it out — be prepared to be taken into custody,' Anderson recalled. 'Day by day, month by month, year by year, time passed, and they never picked me up.' So Anderson went about his life, never trying to conceal his whereabouts or identity. He married, divorced, married again. He raised three children of his own and a stepchild, owned and operated three construction businesses. He coached his son's youth football team in Webster Groves, outside St. Louis, and ran the video operation at his church. In July, Anderson's sentence was supposed to end. When someone at the Missouri Department of Corrections tried to begin the process of releasing him from prison, the agency realized he had never been put behind bars. Family man: Anderson with his wife LaQonna and their four children. In the years since his arrest he has built a business and a loving family life . Anderson said he was just getting up around 6:30 a.m. on a hot July day when he heard a bang on the front door. 'It was one of those, ''Hey, open up the door!'' type knocks,' Anderson said. 'I said, ''Who is it?'' They said, ''U.S. marshals. Open up, or we'll knock the door down''.' Anderson peered through the curtain and saw eight armed marshals. 'They had shields and helmets. They had the streets blocked off. 'I said, ''You've got the wrong person''.' 'One of them said ''You remember 13 years ago when you were supposed to be incarcerated?'"" Anderson, 37, was alone at the time except for his two-year-old daughter. The marshals immediately took custody of the girl. By noon that day, Anderson was at a state prison in Fulton. He stayed there until he was transferred to Charleston a day before Thanksgiving. Model citizen: After his scrape with the law, Anderson became a master carpenter, married, and built his family a home from the ground up . 'It was a nightmare,' Anderson said. 'The only thing I could think about was my wife and my kids.' Attorney General Chris Koster said Thursday that his goal was to suggest a way for the court to balance the seriousness of Anderson's crime with the clerical error made by the justice system and Anderson's conduct since the robbery. 'All three factors deserve recognition in resolving this difficult situation,' Koster said. Jaime Halscott, another of Anderson's attorneys, said Gov. Jay Nixon's office has also been asked to consider commuting the sentence or pardoning Anderson. Abrupt end: Anderson and his wife LaQonna, a hotel manager, who way away on business at the time of his arrest . Nixon's spokesman did not immediately return a message on Friday seeking comment. 'He's been rehabilitated,' Halscott said of Anderson. 'There's no need to protect the community, and even if you want your pound of flesh, he's been in prison nine months. 'At the end of the day, there's no good argument that this man should be in prison.' Anderson's attorneys filed an appeal in February calling his imprisonment unfair and unjust. Attorney Patrick Megaro said the last time something like this happened in Missouri was 1912, and that person was not forced to serve his sentence.","Cornealious 'Mike' Anderson was sentenced to 13 years prison in 2000 for armed robbery .

Portugal's Defence Minister looked on helplessly as a sailor launched the buzzing device with a running jump - and it crashed straight into the water. Scroll down for video . Lift-off: The drone, circled, was launched by the Portguese Navy in front of the nation's Defence Minister...and immediately ditched into the harbour. He admitted: 'This is why we need to invest in a lot of training' The device, a partnership between the Navy and a private firm, was unveiled on Wednesday at the Lisbon Naval Base by Portugal's military elite. Defence Minister José Pedro Aguiar-Branco and Navy Chief of Staff Admiral Macieira Fragoso looked on as the high-tech drone prepared to launch. It would 'be highly effective in missions the Navy has to fulfill', the Minister declared, according to Portuguese newspaper Diário de Notícias. Officials excitedly claimed it would perform search and rescue missions, fisheries enforcement, maritime safety and combat pollution under civilian use. But when it came to the big launch in front of assembled journalists, the unmanned craft ditched immediately into the harbour. Preparation: Before the launch the Defence Minister said the craft would be vital for Navy operations . Anticipation: With the craft buzzing loudly, the unnamed sailor took a run-up before hurling it skywards . A video of the disastrous PR stunt has already been viewed online more than 250,000 times. A second launch shortly afterwards did succeed, officials said, and followed the flight plan which had originally been laid down for it. The Minister admitted: 'This explains why it is always necessary to invest a lot in training at . the right time so that tasks do not fail.' Since basic drones went on sale for as little as £60 they have been used for everything from taking selfies to scouting out houses to burgle. This week Google bought out a firm which makes military-style drones for £36million, sparking fears the internet giant's high-quality mapping could push the boundaries of people's rights to privacy. Whoops: The test 'pilot' could only watch as the craft was held aloft for no more than a few seconds .","High-tech craft was launched at the Lisbon Naval Base by Defence Minister .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A pensioner died after an ambulance crew finished their lunchbreak before answering a call – and were then left struggling to locate his home because the service’s satnav-style database was out of date. When diabetic Albert Jobson, 76, fell ill at his home in Ilfracombe, Devon, in March wife Dolores called her doctors. A GP visited him and rang South West Ambulance Service Trust at 11.52am to say he needed to be admitted to hospital within an hour. The ambulance crew took lunch break before answering call to pick up Mr Jobson but then couldn't find his address (file picture) But a mix-up meant that a patient transport ambulance was allocated – and it arrived in the town two hours later to say it could not find the address. Daniel Thorogood, the ambulance trust control officer, told an inquest in Barnstaple: ‘The crew completed their lunch break and then mobilised, which delayed it by 30 minutes.’ He added that the organisation’s street database was two years out of date, which was why crews struggled to find the address. The ambulance crew struggled to find Mr Jobson's address as their satnav (file picture) was out of date . The transport crew finally arrived at around 2pm but with Mr Jobson’s condition deteriorating his wife had already made a 999 call. An emergency crew arrived at 2.15pm – and another at 2.44pm – but Mr Jobson was pronounced dead at North Devon Hospital in Barnstaple at 3.08pm. Mrs Jobson said the delays surrounding her husband’s treatment amounted to ‘negligence’. She said: 'I think the whole thing was negligence with the ambulance not coming within an hour. The family feel he did not have a fighting chance of life.' The ambulance trust apologised and said its system is now updated quarterly. Adrian South said from the Trust said: 'I find it upsetting when cases like this occur. I am personally sorry for what happened. 'We have invested to make sure this system is updated on a quarterly basis. The patient transport service has also been privatised so we no longer provide that service.' The North Devon Coroner recorded a misadventure verdict. Mr Jobson’s daughter Carol Krosschell said: 'We feel that dad was taken from us due to a catalogue of errors.'","Albert Jobson, 76, fell ill at his home in Illfracombe in Devon .

"By . Emily Kent Smith . Just 250 out of of 7,188 benefits cheats were put behind bars in 2012, despite claims from Westminster that a tougher stance would be taken on swindlers. New Ministry of Justice figures, requested by a Conservative backbencher, reveal that, between 2008 and 2012, the number of benefits cheats taken into custody decreased each year apart from one. Benefits fraud costs the UK up to £2 billion each year yet just 1,306 out of 32,847 were sent to jail for the crimes. Benefits fraud costs the UK up to £2 billion each year yet just 1,306 out of 32,847 were sent to jail for the crimes . Conservative backbencher Philip Davies said: 'I was very shocked. And I think the public will be very shocked.' He added: 'It brings the benefits system into disrepute. The courts should start treating this crime as seriously as the public. I think it’s a scandal. As far as I'm concerned it's soft justice. 'The blame here lies squarely on the judges -they are not using the powers that they should be.' Backbencher Philip Davies slammed judges for being too soft on cheats who he said brought the 'benefits system into disrepute' The MP for Shipley, West Yorkshire, said that he was planning on writing to Iain Duncan Smith, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, to address the issue. He also said that he planned to write to the Sentencing Council. Mr Davies said that he believed there should be mandatory prison sentences for those committing benefit fraud. He added: 'It's theft and it's theft of taxpayers' money.' The chief executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance also called for the authorities to 'clamp down hard' on  fraud cases. Jonathan Isaby said: 'Individuals committing benefit fraud are not only stealing from . taxpayers but they’re also taking money meant for the poorest and most . vulnerable in society. 'Taxpayers want to know that their . money is reaching those truly in need, so the authorities must clamp . down hard on cases of fraud in order to punish offenders and deter . others tempted to play the system. 'It’s troubling that so . few are facing serious sanctions for ripping off taxpayers and those . genuinely in need: the consequences of being caught have to be strong . enough to discourage others from trying to take taxpayers for a ride.' Commenting on the figures, a spokesman for the Department of Work and Pensions said: . 'Our teams are now investigating more cases in our work to stop fraudsters who see benefits as a way of lining their pockets. 'We always push hard for the strongest punishments and we are introducing tougher civil penalties for benefit cheats as well as looking to ensure stolen benefits cash is repaid.' Last year, the former Director of Public Prosecutions said that up to ten-year sentences would be imposed on 'professional' cheats who 'get one over on the system'. Keir Starmer said: ‘It’s not only taxpayers that suffer. ‘Benefits exist to protect and support the most vulnerable people in our society and, whenever the system is defrauded, it’s also taking money away from those with a genuine need. ‘The cost to the nation incurred by benefit fraud should be at the forefront of lawyers’ minds when considering whether a prosecution is in the public interest. ‘The loss of money has a significant impact on communities up and down the country.’ Yet last month a former television presented walked free from court with a suspended sentence after she claimed £76,000 in housing benefits in order to pay off her credit card bills. Louise Port, 37, who worked for GMTV, was renting out her Canary Wharf property for £1,000 a month at the time.

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . Plans to clamp down on the promotion of junk food in supermarkets have been scrapped after major stores refused to sign up. Under the scheme, so-called ‘guilt lanes’ – where sweets and chocolates are prominently displayed next to checkouts – would have been banned. But the retailers have effectively killed off the Government’s ‘Responsibility Deal’ to tackle rising obesity levels by refusing to sign up. Retailers have refused to sign up to the Government's 'Responsibilty Deal' to remove prominently displayed sweets and chocolate from checkouts, to help tackle obesity levels . Health campaigners last night accused the supermarkets of putting profit before their customers’ health, and said ministers should introduce laws on junk food rather than relying on voluntary schemes. As well as action on guilt lanes, under the plan there would have been a ban  on promoting sugary drinks and snacks in high-profile positions on the end  of shelves after a Government-backed study found this led to a surge in sales. The supermarkets have also rejected the idea of setting up a scheme that would have given customers rewards for buying healthy food such as fruit and vegetables. The collapse of the initiatives is a huge blow to the Government’s efforts to tackle rising obesity and associated  ill-health, which is costing the NHS £5billion a year to treat. The Government’s chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, is so concerned about unhealthy food that she has  suggested it may be necessary to impose sugar tax to curb consumption. And it will raise further questions over the influence that supermarkets and other food giants are able to exert on government policy. The Daily Mail revealed in February how the food industry lobby had been given unprecedented access to the heart of Government. Supermarkets, fast food chains and chocolate and fizzy drinks firms have  had dozens of meetings with ministers since the 2010 election, while health  campaigners had been kept at arms length. Tam Fry, spokesman for the National Obesity Forum and chairman of the Child Growth Foundation, said the collapse of the scheme was evidence that voluntary deals with the retail industry would not work. He said: ‘Pester power at the checkouts, where children demand sweets and chocolates, is enormously powerful. ‘The fact that the supermarkets refuse to tackle this is a disaster. ‘The Government has been told by many people that voluntary deals do not work and here is the proof. The collapse of the initiatives is a huge blow to the Government's efforts to tackle rising obesity levels and associated ill-health which is costing the NHS £2.5billion a year to treat . 'The reality is that money comes first and health second.’ She added: ‘It is time for the Government to take a firm line. Obesity is a totally preventable problem. ‘If the supermarkets lose a little money for public good that is something they should be able to shoulder.’ It was hoped the public health Responsibility Deal would have seen all  the major supermarkets promise to  voluntarily ban junk food – high in fat, salt and sugar – from ‘guilt lanes’ and prominent positions at the end of aisles. Retailers would also have agreed that more than 30 per cent of food promotions, such as buy-one-get-one-free, would be skewed towards healthy products such as fruit and vegetables. There would also have been a ban on the use of popular children’s characters, such as movie superheroes or pop stars, to promote unhealthy food and fizzy drinks. However, trade magazine The Grocer said the supermarkets had refused to sign up to the wide-ranging measures as they ‘had failed to reach a consensus and claimed a voluntary pledge would not work on such a commercially sensitive issue’. The Department of Health has  conceded that it will have to leave it up to individual retailers as to whether they want to stop promoting junk food.","Under scheme 'guilt lanes' would have been banned .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . If you spot a flying snail in your garden this weekend don’t worry, you are not seeing things. It is not very neighbourly… but a fifth of gardeners admit to throwing snails over the fence next door to get rid of them. A poll by the Royal Horticultural Society of 1,500 people found that 80 per cent of us will be heading out to the garden this Easter weekend to do jobs such as weeding and mowing the lawn. Londoners are most likely to get rid of snails over the fence (30 per cent), while Scots are the least likely (only 14 per cent) Despite such wholesome pursuits, 22 per cent surveyed admitted to disposing of their snails over the garden wall. Londoners are most likely to get rid of snails in this way, with 30 per cent polled saying they had done so, while Scotland is home to the most polite neighbours. Snail throwing was least common there, with just 14 per cent surveyed admitting to it. Some 80 per cent of those quizzed said they would be weeding this weekend, 63 per cent said they would be mowing and 44 per cent cutting back last year’s foliage on herbaceous plants. The survey found men were more likely to be caring for their garden lawns than women, with 70 per cent of men saying they would be mowing, compared with 57 per cent of women. Other jobs that gardeners will be getting busy with at Easter include pruning shrubs after flowering and sowing seeds indoors. RHS Head of Advisory, Guy Barter, said: ‘After the challenging cold weather last spring, gardeners are enjoying a great start to the season this year and making the most of the sunshine. 80 per cent of people said they would be tending to their gardens over this Easter weekend . ‘In March at the RHS we had record calls to our advisory team and answered over 6,000 gardening questions.’ Many gardeners intend to have more pots and more flowers to decorate their gardens with this year, which was good news for garden centres, he said. The survey also revealed that most people gardened to create beautiful spaces to relax in, and many would be having barbecues, meals and family gatherings in their gardens this Easter.","The statistic has been found by the Royal Horticultural Society in a survey of 1,500 people .

"By . Jack Doyle, Home Affairs Correspondent . Members of the public are being urged to stop using CCTV cameras to film their neighbours . Fears of excessive state surveillance are commonplace. But it seems the real spies could be closer to home – the neighbours. Members of the public have been urged to stop using CCTV to film those living next door after a surge in complaints. Tony Porter, the Surveillance Camera Commissioner, appealed to people’s ‘common decency’, saying victims feel their privacy is being invaded by lenses peering into their house or garden. But the watchdog added that complaining to the police is often pointless because there is no law against installing CCTV on private property. The price of security cameras has plummeted in recent years, with many homeowners buying them cheaply over the internet. However, Mr Porter said anyone thinking about putting one up should ask themselves whether they really need it. The former senior counter-terrorism officer told the Daily Mail that complaints were on the rise, adding: ‘I’ve got a great deal of sympathy for anybody who feels that their own private space is being invaded by the use of a CCTV camera employed by a neighbour. ‘I can understand how invasive that feels.  As far as I’m aware, the police have been involved on many occasions and the response has been “sorry, there’s not a lot we can do”.’ Mr Porter, who was appointed in February, is drawing up official guidelines for those installing domestic cameras. They will be asked a series of questions about why they want them and if they are really needed. The code of conduct will also ask them to consider the impact on their neighbours’ privacy. ‘You could say it’s part of the code but you could also say it’s common decency,’ said Mr Porter. ‘If there’s absolutely no requirement to impact on other people’s privacy then, frankly, you shouldn’t – it’s wrong.’ Police do have the option of using harassment laws against CCTV owners, he said, but the legal bar is high. As a last resort, members of the public can go to court to claim invasion of privacy but that is complicated and expensive. The price of security cameras has plummeted in recent years, with many homeowners buying them cheaply over the internet . Mr Porter also acknowledged that the use by police of automatic number plate cameras – which record the journeys of tens of millions of motorists every day – amounted to a ‘large data grab’ of information on innocent people. The devices log all vehicles that go past and capture pictures of their licence plates, along with details of where they were and at what time. These are then placed on a national database. Police say the ANPR system is an essential crime-fighting tool, but civil liberties campaigners consider it ‘extremely intrusive’. Mr Porter said he recognised the concern that ‘there are large numbers of cameras and the public don’t know where they sit’.","Surveillance Camera Commissioner appealed to public 'common decency'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A shopping centre has installed a new 'overtaking lane' for speedy shoppers after receiving a letter from a schoolgirl grumbling about ‘slow walkers’. Meadowhall Shopping Centre in Sheffield received the note from Chloe Nash-Lowe, 10, moaning about her biggest bug-bear and as a result they have installed a fast lane for those in a hurry. The schoolgirl wrote to the shopping complex as part of a school project asking if anything could be done to solve the problem, listing a whole host of reasons why sluggish shoppers should be sped up. She asked: 'Will you ever tell people not to walk slow? If you do this for me I will be delighted – please do it.' Rapid retail: Meadowhall Shopping Centre in Sheffield received a note about slow shoppers from Chloe Nash-Lowe, 10, and as a result they have installed a fast lane . However, Chloe had no idea that they would enforce a traffic flow system to tackle the problem, and was thrilled to hear they are putting her plan into action. Chloe, from Aughton, South Yorkshire, said: 'It makes me really cross when people take my time up by walking really slowly. 'They just get in the way - you get stuck behind them and you can't move past them. 'With an overtaking lane, people can walk slowly if they want to but if you want to walk faster you can. Everyone can walk at whatever speed they want.' Meadowhall Centre Director Darren Pearce believed it was a great idea and responded to the letter, before meeting with Chloe to discuss her suggestion. 'I want to thank Chloe for taking the time to write in and share her views with us – we love to hear feedback from our younger shoppers,' said Mr Pearce. Chloe, from Aughton, South Yorkshire, said: 'It makes me really cross when people take my time up by walking really slowly' 'The Meadowhall team liked Chloe’s idea so much that we have decided to trial an over-taking lane for fast walkers on the malls – helping them to get where they want to be on time – let’s see how it goes!' Chloe said: 'When my teacher, Mr Lawson, asked me to write a letter about something I’d like to change, I never thought it would actually happen. Chloe’s mum Rebecca Lowe, said: 'Chloe’s always giving me feedback when she goes to places so I wasn’t surprised to hear she wasn’t happy about not being able to walk fast enough around Meadowhall. 'It’s great that they’re taking her idea further and putting it forward into the shopping centre.

"By . Joe Bernstein . True Evertonians should applaud their former manager David Moyes as he takes his place in the away dug-out at Goodison Park today. That is what David Weir, Everton’s captain under Moyes when they played Champions League football in 2005, believes. Realistically, though, Weir knows the old bear pit of a stadium will be at its most raucous and partisan today as they get ready to ‘welcome’ not one but three former Everton icons, who walked out on them to join the detested Manchester United. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch David Moyes cracking jokes ahead of the game . Warm welcome? David Moyes returns to Goodison Park for the first time as United manager on Sunday . Old boys: Wayne Rooney (L) and Marouane Fellaini will also be going back to their former club Everton . If the sound levels will be loud for Moyes, they will be off the scale when Wayne Rooney and Marouane Fellaini walk down the tunnel in red. Both managers aren’t even bothering to ignore the animosity that will exist. Moyes pointed out that Sir Alex Ferguson used to pull Rooney out of Everton games because of the abuse he got. Martinez, who beneath his butter-wouldn’t-melt demeanour quite enjoys the jousting, has not helped Fellaini by indicating the £27million Belgian would not be able to get in the current Everton team. Ouch! Fall from grace: Wayne Rooney used to be pulled out of Everton games by Alex Ferguson because of the abuse . New kid on the block: Wayne Rooney celebrates scoring for Everton against Portsmouth in 2004 . Everton fans have been debating all week whether they should cheer or boo Moyes, weighing up 11 years of good service against the ‘treachery’ of joining United and then trying to take Fellaini and Leighton Baines with him. The game is important in pure football terms, too. Everton need three points to keep in touch with Arsenal in the race for fourth. Having been hammered by Manchester City and Liverpool, defeat at Goodison will feel like another nail in Moyes’ coffin. The league table currently shows he has taken United from first to seventh. Amid the bedlam, Weir — a hugely-respected figure at Goodison who played 269 games in eight years and then served on the coaching staff — hopes Moyes’ positive contribution to Everton will not be forgotten. ‘The vast majority of Everton fans are good football people. They understand the game and will appreciate the hard word David put and the legacy he left,’ said Weir. ‘Knowing them, they wouldn’t understand why he left because they love Everton so much. They would be devastated to think he saw Manchester United as a step up. They don’t! Legacy: Former Toffees captain David Weir insists true Evertonians will applaud Moyes . ‘Everton is my club and I’d love to think true Evertonians would all applaud David. But if I’m honest, maybe it won’t be that way. I think it will be mixed.’ Weir has himself had a turbulent first season in management, sacked by Sheffield United after just 13 games before celebrating promotion to the Championship with Brentford as their assistant- manager. From experience, he knows just how good Moyes is. ‘First of all, he is a great coach. That is the most important thing, his knowledge of the game and the information he has,’ said Weir. ‘He is really detailed, interested in how other teams to play. His attention to detail is very good. At times, we walked out the tunnel feeling we’d played the game already, we knew what the opposition was going to do. ‘He left no stone unturned, we had video meetings that could go on for an hour. It was all about planning for all eventualities. It was a thoroughness that stood the team in good stead – you just felt prepared. Poisoned chalice? Things haven't gone according to plan since Moyes agreed to replace Ferguson (L) Hands off! Some Everton fans were angered by Moyes pursuit of left-back Leighton Baines (L) ‘I think United know that and I would expect him to be there in 12 months. He gets to the heart of things quickly. ‘We had a really sticky start under him at Everton and Bill Kenwright was probably under pressure to make a change because the fans weren’t happy. ‘But he stuck with him and I genuinely have no doubt if United do the same, he’ll get it right. His over-riding character trait is single-mindedness. I’ve not seen it to that extent in anyone else.’ For all Weir’s plaudits, Moyes knows he has to show he can win big games as United boss. Perhaps the most damning statistic of his United reign so far is that the team have managed to win only six points from a possible 33 against the Premier League’s top six. Final farewell: Moyes waves to supporters during his last game in charge at the club . Staying power: Moyes has awarded Rooney a new contract, despite his falling out with Ferguson . Moyes tried to distance himself from the shadow of Sir Alex Ferguson by awarding Rooney a five-year deal when Ferguson wanted him out. Now, he is going to trust Rooney in a fixture Ferguson sometimes felt was too much for the player. Rooney, a boyhood Everton fan, joined United in 2004 despite once claiming ‘Once a Blue, always a Blue’, has regularly received abuse at Goodison and Ferguson left him out of a game there in 2010. ‘I know Rooney’s relationship with the Everton crowd was something Alex felt at times and took into account,’ said Moyes. ‘But Wayne is a different player now. He’s got maturity, just signed a new contract and is due to go to the World Cup. ‘If ever there was a player ready to play in any game it would be Wayne Rooney, with the age he is, the time of his career, what he is capable of. He is about to be one of England’s leading players in the World Cup and you’ll be expecting him to stand up, so I’ll expect him to stand up and be seen at Goodison on Sunday.’ For the first time, Rooney may have to share the billing as primary hate figure in an opposition shirt – with Everton fans disgruntled by the way Fellaini forced a deadline day move. Martinez hasn’t made things any easier for the Belgian He thinks he got a good deal by selling Fellaini and signing Republic of Ireland international James McCarthy from Wigan for less than half the price, £12.5million. Not missed! Roberto Martinez claims that Fellaini would no longer get into his Everton team . Indeed, he doesn’t believe Fellaini would get in his side, who start the day in fifth place, nine points ahead of United despite slipping up in midweek against Crystal Palace. ‘You’re looking at McCarthy, Gareth Barry, Leon Osman —where would Fellaini fit in?’ said Martinez, all good fuel for the Everton faithful waiting to bait their former idol. ‘In football you move on so quickly. I’m just so happy with the squad that we have. It’s incredible to have that mixture of youth and experience. It looks like this side has been playing together for the last five years. It’s so natural.’","David Moyes returns to Everton for the first time as Man United boss .

Moments before, the man had asked to use the hostel's bathroom but instead of leaving and thanking staff he brutally kicked their pet. Scroll down for video . Catters pictured on CCTV before the attack happened at the Liverpool hostel . The unknown man is then pictured walking up to the cat as if he is about to enter the bathroom . The man then looks around to make sure that no one is watching him . Staff at Hatters hostel now want to see the callous abuser brought to justice and are asking for anyone who recognises the man to come forward. They have also reported the incident to the RSPCA and pictures of the man have been shared on social media. Catters was a stray before he moved into the hostel six years ago. Staff now lovingly care for the little cat, feeding him every day and even giving him a hot water bottle when it is cold. They also spent their own money building a wooden hut for the cat and there is a mural in the hostel devoted to it. But manager Paul Mercer, 32, said that although Catters used to be friendly and affectionate, since the attack his personality has changed completely. He said: 'He doesnâ€™t seem to be suffering physically but he is definitely wary of humans at the moment. 'He will normally wander up to people and stand and the door and wait for them to let him in. 'Now he will start running rather than come up to you - he is very wary.' Mr Mercer described the attack as 'disgusting'. He said: 'It was the fact that he was videoing himself doing it which was disgraceful. 'We want to find the guy because you would not have thought this is the first time he has done it. 'We want to see him caught.' He is then pictured taking out his phone, ready to film the attack on the camera of his iPhone . The man can be seen lifting up his leg to kick the cat . The man then starts to turn round with a smirk on his face as if he is about to go back down the corridor . Mr Mercer said he was 'shocked' when he learned about the attack. He said: 'I was disgusted that someone could do it and it looked like he enjoyed it. 'It's the size of the guy in comparison to the cat. 'If you see someone hitting a kid you just donâ€™t do it. 'The cat is part of the family.' But the man then goes back to the door and pictures the cat lying on the bathroom floor . The man then gives the cat a second kick after the first attack . The man then walks off again and appears to be re-watching the footage on his phone . The man came into the hostel last . Saturday night at around midnight and asked to use the bathroom. He then walked down to the ground . floor toilets and came out of the bathroom before kicking the cat back . through the bathroom doorway. He then returns a second time and kicks the animal again.

"By . Emma Glanfield . Jason Scotland-Williams, 34, completed the marathon in just over three hours - knocking more than four hours off his time last year of seven hours 24 minutes . A London Marathon runner - who completed the second half of the race quicker than Olympic champion Mo Farah - is under investigation following claims he jumped over a barrier to slash 10 miles from the route. Jason Scotland-Williams, 34, completed this year’s marathon in three hours eight minutes - knocking more than four hours off his time last year of seven hours 24 minutes. The aspiring model, from Hammersmith, London, ran the first half of the marathon in two hours and seven minutes – an average time for an amateur athlete. However, he ran the second half of the race in just one hour and one minute – quicker than Olympic hero Mo Farah who completed the same stretch in one hour and five minutes. It means Scotland-Williams finished the race in an impressive three hours and eight minutes – putting him in the top six per cent of competitors. However, online forums are awash with claims the runner cheated his way to the super-fast time, with some speculating he jumped over a waist-high barrier at the halfway point at Tower Bridge. It is alleged he jumped the barrier separating the 13-mile marker from the 22-mile point and hid in the crowds while runners looped round Canary Wharf and doubled back. It is claimed he then jumped back into the race, joining a leading group of runners, and sprinted his way to the finish. The official London Marathon website logs his progress around the first half of the course, giving updates for every 5kms he completed. However, it only gives estimated times at the 25km, 30km and 35km markers – which has prompted critics to believe he either cheated his way to the finish by dodging those checkpoints or that his chip failed to activate at those points. Jason Scotland-Williams, 34, above, from Hammersmith, London, faces claims he cheated after completing the second half of the marathon in one hour and one minute - quicker than Olympic champion Mo Farah . London Marathon organisers are investigating Jason Scotland-Williams' time after he ran the second half of the race in just over an hour. Internet forums are awash with claims he jumped over a barrier in the Tower Bridge area . Jason Scotland-Williams' result suggests he ran the second half of the race in just one hour and one minute – quicker than Olympic champion Mo Farah, above,  who completed the same stretch in one hour five minutes . However, his chip was working as he passed the 40km point and the finish line – which reveals he completed the last 13 miles in just one hour and one minute. Forum users have questioned the runner’s speedy time, suggesting it would have been a ‘miracle’ if he managed to complete the second half of the race in such a short space of time. One user, Chris Pearson, posted on a forum on Runners World: ‘First half seems fair enough.  Second half is nothing short of a miracle. ‘It is possible that he ran easy for the first half, then went all out in the second half. ‘However, it would need a chip malfunction at 25, 30, and 35k for this to have happened. ‘It would also mean that he is capable of running a half at just over 60 minute pace, which again is possible if he was a World class elite runner, but certainly not after doing a 13.1 mile warm up.’ Scotland-Williams had posted numerous photos on his Facebook profile of him wearing his marathon medals and showing off his supposed athletic ability. However, the page was closed down this morning . Results on the London Marathon's official website show Jason Scotland-Williams completed the race in three hours eight minutes. However, they also show estimated times were given at the 25K, 30K and 35K markers . Another user, Millsy1977 - a fellow marathon runner - said: ‘If it was legit he would have sped past me on Birdcage walk. I know I was tired but I think I'd have noticed someone 4.30 miling.’ Another marathon runner, Darryl Morris, said: ‘I saw Jason just after Tower Bridge and he was absolutely smashing it’, before adding: ‘Just noted the barrier skip … that would make complete sense as to why I saw him there, looking so fresh!’ And Ryan T said: ‘If he did cheat then I think a ban is in order, I worked very hard for my time this year, did a sub 3:30 for my first marathon and went through a lot of pain in the last three miles, if people are skipping out miles then shame on them!’ Virgin Money London Marathon confirmed Scotland-Williams’ results were being investigated. A spokesman told The Sun: ‘We have anti-cheating measures during the event, and then post-event when we analyse split times from points around the course. ‘Runners found to have cheated are removed from results and banned from future events.’ Jason Scotland-Williams, 34, completed this year's marathon in just over three hours - knocking more than four hours off his time last year of seven hours 24 minutes . Scotland-Williams, who wore a V for Vendetta mask during last weekend’s race, has taken part in the London Marathon for the last six years. He had posted numerous photos on his Facebook profile of him wearing his marathon medals and showing off his supposed athletic ability. However, his profile was removed from the social-networking site this morning. This year he was running to raise money for deaf-blind charity Sense. A spokesman for the charity said: ‘An allegation that a runner cheated at the London Marathon has been brought to our attention. ‘We are urgently investigating and would be very disappointed if this was true.’ The Sun reported it tried to contact Scotland-Williams but was told to ‘f*** off’. MailOnline has contacted Virgin Money London Marathon for a comment but organisers have not yet responded.","Jason Scotland-Williams completed race in three hours eight minutes .

"By . Derek Hunter . Arsene Wenger has backed Jack Wilshere to take the World Cup by storm after revealing the Arsenal star’s rehabilitation from a broken foot will ensure he is in peak condition for England this summer. The 22-year-old has not played since suffering a hairline fracture to his left foot during England’s friendly against Denmark on March 5 — an injury that appeared to threaten his participation in Brazil. But Wenger says the midfielder is likely to return for Arsenal’s clash with West Bromwich on May 5 and that he has already assured England manager Roy Hodgson he should have no worries about naming the playmaker in his squad. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Wilshere and Neymar star in the new Nike ad . On the mend: Jack Wilshere will go to the World Cup in peak condition, according to Arsene Wenger . Ouchy! The Arsenal playmaker has not played since breaking his foot in an international friendly against Denmark . ‘Jack started to jog again this week and I would say two to three weeks until he returns to action,’ said Wenger. ‘I spoke with Roy Hodgson, I told him Wilshere will be available for England. He will be just polished for England. ‘I think he will pick him. I didn’t feel any doubt on that front. Jack can prove himself to be  world class at the World Cup. He can be the positive surprise. Pep talk: Wenger has told England manager Roy Hodgson that Wilshere will be polished for the World Cup . ‘England has a very difficult group but if you come out of a group like that your belief is really strong. They have to deal really well with the situation as they have Italy and Uruguay in the group and they have to get out of there.’ Wenger also believes Wilshere is ready to put his long run of injuries behind him and show his consistency next season. A long-term ankle problem meant he did not make a single appearance during the 2011-12 season and just 35 for club and country the following campaign. Yet Wenger says Wilshere has learned a lot during his lay-offs and is adamant he will prove his doubters wrong when he gets a run of games. Stuttered: Wilshere has had a stop-start season after a succession of niggling injuries . ‘He has been stop-start this year and last season,’ he said. ‘I think we have sorted out the problem and I hope from now on he will be always available. ‘I hope he has stabilised now. We have seen with Lionel Messi recently, who is the best player in the world, that being in and out is the most difficult thing to deal with as you need to be competitive and to do that you need to be playing. ‘He is a football man, Jack. You speak to him about something in the game and he understands straight away. He has a natural football understanding. Not much in it: Wenger insists that Arsenal have not fallen behind Liverpool, despite the league table . ‘He watches the game and analyses very well what happens. While they are injured, these players learn, of course. I think he learns from watching the games, from the problems you can face in the game.’ And Wenger has refuted suggestions Arsenal have fallen behind Liverpool this season, saying that the Reds’ lack of European football has helped them while his side have only struggled due to injuries. ‘We beat them twice this season and they also benefited from a season when they played only the Premier League. I do not think if you take the injuries, plus all the competitions we played in and compared it to Liverpool you cannot say we are miles behind them.’","Arsene Wenger claims Jack Wilshere will prove his class at the World Cup .

"By . Jamie Redknapp . Liverpool's win over Manchester City was one of the best games I’ve seen for a long time. Liverpool were sensational and just blew City away in the first half. There were questions over whether they could cope with the pressure but they answered them all with a wonderful performance. Raheem Sterling and Philippe Coutinho set the tone and were fantastic all game but after going behind City came back so well. They had Liverpool on the ropes and the home side looked almost ready to settle for a draw before Coutinho hit a brilliant strike to win it. Glory days: Philippe Coutinho celebrates Liverpool's winner with his teammates on Sunday . Liverpool have won 10 straight Premier League games, equalling their club record. It was an enthralling, end-to-end game and what the Premier League is all about. Now we have to wait and see what will win the title: the flair and power of Liverpool and Man City or Chelsea’s defensive determination. Liverpool have won 10 in a row but they will have to break a top-flight record if they want to win it. Arsenal won 14 straight games in 2002 but that was split across two seasons. Liverpool could match that record in one. They have four games left and need to win them all. There is no room to slip up. Excitement: Flags and scarves are held aloft on a special day at Anfield as Liverpool beat Manchester City . Tough day at the office: Manchester City's Vincent Kompany holds his hands on his hips . Kompany's bad day at the office . After his performances this season . plenty of people were ready to say Vincent Kompany was the best defender . in the world, but Sunday was a game to forget. He . played a part in all three Liverpool goals, with Raheem Sterling’s . sidestep catching him out so badly he had to pay to get back in. Then he . was easily brushed off by Martin Skrtel for the second and made a hash . of his clearance for the third. Watching the Masters . this weekend you might wonder how the pros can miss a putt from two feet . — it was the same watching Kompany slice his clearance. It was . something you would see in a park on a Sunday morning. If Martin . Demichelis had made that mistake, I don’t know if we’d see him in a City . shirt again, but Kompany is such an important part of this team. The Belgian had one of those days that we all have in football and he will want to move on, but for City it came at a big price. Three-horse race . People might find it hard to believe but I’m sure Man City will have been pleased to see Chelsea win at Swansea. That win keeps the title race alive for Jose Mourinho because if they had lost, I think he would have put the Premier League on hold and focused all his efforts on the Champions League. Big win: Chelsea players celebrate at the Liberty Stadium as they pick up a crucial victory against Swansea . With this result, I expect Chelsea to go to Anfield later this month with everything still to play for, which will only help City. Chelsea play Atletico Madrid in the Champions League semi-final either side of their game against Liverpool, and with Jose’s fixture complaints he could easily have focused on Europe. But with that win the fight for the title remains a three-horse race. All to play for: Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho will take his team to Anfield later this month . Marshall rule . Winning at St Mary’s was a good result for Cardiff and goalkeeper David Marshall played a huge part. The Scot has been in fine form all season and Saturday was no exception. He made seven saves in the game — more than any other goalkeeper this weekend — and has made more saves than any other goalkeeper. Without him between the posts Cardiff might have struggled even more this season. Safe hands: Cardiff goalkeeper David Marshall has been in fine form this season . Christian drives Spurs onwards . Christian Eriksen saved Tottenham yet again on Saturday with a last-gasp goal. Spurs spent a huge amount of money last summer and none of the other signings has looked up to scratch. But the £11.5m they paid for Eriksen looks like money well spent. His late goal spared Tottenham’s blushes at West Brom and it’s not the first time he’s led a Spurs fightback. He scored the winner at Old Trafford and when Spurs went 2-0 down at home to Southampton it was Eriksen who scored twice to get his team back in the game. Jubilation: Tottenham midfielder Christian Eriksen (right) celebrates scoring against West Brom . He has fantastic ability on the ball, good vision and he has that great imagination that Tottenham fans want to see. He has made the most assists at the club and also created nearly twice as many chances as the next best Tottenham player. Tim Sherwood said he could be the club’s Dennis Bergkamp. He has a long way to go to reach that level, but he’s made a good start to his career at White Hart Lane. The force is with Fulham . After two wins on the bounce, Fulham have now got enough momentum to get out of trouble. They have not won two straight games since October and at the end of March they were five points from safety having played a game more. Now they are just two points behind Norwich and level on games played. With the fixtures they have left, Felix Magath and his men will be optimistic of staying up. Animated: Fulham manager Felix Magath looks as if he is leading his team to safety . Trophy a must for Arsenal . I was not surprised by Arsenal’s FA Cup performance. After the defeat by Everton the game against Wigan was all about getting to the final. They were not at their best but they will be back at Wembley next month as red-hot favourites. All the pressure is now on Arsene Wenger because the club need silverware and they can’t afford to let this chance slip by. Up for the cup: Arsenal players celebrate as they beat Wigan on penalties in the FA Cup semi-final . 93 - The omens are good for Brendan Rodgers’ free-scoring Liverpool. After scoring another three at Anfield they have now hit 93 goals this season, their best tally for 50 years. In  1963-64 Liverpool scored 92 on their way to winning the league title. And at an average of 2.7 per game this season, Liverpool are on the march again. 6 - Sunderland have now conceded a league-high of six own goals this season. Wes Brown’s against Everton took his career tally to five — only four men have scored more in the Premier League. Sore one: Sunderland's Wes Brown shows his frustrations after deflecting the ball into his own net . 1962 - The last time Cardiff beat Southampton away from home in the league was in October 1962 when they won a 5-3 thriller at The Dell. 0-0 - A scoreline you won’t see when Fulham are playing. There has not been a goalless draw in Fulham’s last 46 Premier League games, the longest run of any team in the league. 24 - Sunderland had 24 efforts at goal against Everton, including blocked shots, but failed to score with any of them. Only Chelsea (26) had more attempts.weekend. 84 - No player completed more passes than Southampton’s Morgan Schneiderlin this weekend. The midfielder found a team-mate with 84 of his 88 passes, a success rate of 95.5 per cent. Pass mark: Southampton's Morgan Schneiderlin completed more passes than any other player this weekend . 56 - Liverpool have been attacking teams from the off all season and they have now scored 56 goals in the first half of matches. They have also scored 22 goals in the first 20 minutes, more than any other team in the league.","Liverpool's 3-2 win over Manchester City is what the Premier League is all about .

"By . Tim Shipman, Deputy Political Editor . Claim: Nigel Farage has been paid more than £60,000 in expenses for his constituency office . Nigel Farage was facing a probe into the UK Independence Party’s finances last night as the Electoral Commission announced that he has ‘questions to answer’ over the use of his British office. Ukip supporters John and Julia Longhurst gave a building in West Sussex called ‘The Old Grain Store’ to Mr Farage rent-free 15 years ago. But the only time the Euro MP has listed the donation was in June 2004 when a £1,100 donation was filed with the election watchdog as ‘non cash-premises’. The Electoral Commission announced that it is writing to Mr Farage to ask him to explain why he did not register the office as a benefit in kind every year. The Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 clearly states that ‘the provision otherwise than on commercial terms of any property, services or facilities for the use or benefit of the party’ counts as a donation. A spokesman for the Electoral Commission: ‘There are a lot of questions around this. We’re getting in touch with the party to seek clarification. ‘We would like more information because Mr Farage is a regulated donee and so is his constituency party. We need to see whether donations in kind were registered in the right way.’ Mr Farage also faced charges of hypocrisy yesterday as it emerged that he has claimed ‘general expenditure allowances’ from the European Parliament averaging £15,000 a year to pay for the same office – while denouncing EU largesse and MPs who abuse Westminster expenses. While Mr Farage is not required by the EU to justify where the money has gone, he has voluntarily declared how much money has been spent on the office since 2009 – a sum totalling nearly £70,000. Mr Farage said: ‘I’m not defending this system, I want it to end. But I get given, as does every other British MEP, £3,580 every month to spend in the UK and in my constituency as I see fit. 'We do not have to provide any receipts or any explanation for how that money is spent.’ Asked where the money goes, he said: ‘The electricity bill is more than £3,000 a year.’ Premises: Mr Farage claims that the converted barn near Bognor Regis costs him £1,000 a month to run . Expenses: The UKIP leader claims the money as a member of the European Parliament, pictured . Nigel Farage has previously boasted over the vast amounts of expenses he is able to claim from the European Parliament. In 2009, after a decade as an MEP, he estimated that he had claimed £2million in expenses - a figure which would now stand at £3million if it continued at the same rate. He has come under fire for employing his wife Kirsten as a secretary, using £20,000 a year in public funds. And this month it emerged that he uses a private company to funnel the money he is paid for media appearances, which could halve his tax bill. Mr Farage has always defended his use of expenses, saying that he spends everything he claims on UKIP's campaign to pull Britain out of the EU. The . Ukip leader lost his temper when asked to explain why the cost was so . high for a small office measuring just 625 sq ft. The average dual fuel . bill for a 1,000 sq ft home is just £1,200. Questioned . on Sky News whether he was running in his office ‘a sauna’ or ‘Tracey . Island’ – the headquarters in the TV children’s series Thunderbirds – Mr . Farage attacked the interviewer Dermot Murngahan as an ‘establishment’ stooge and added: ‘We are  running machines, running banks of computers, . running photocopiers.’ However . a former member of Ukip has asked the European Parliament’s anti-fraud . office OLAF to investigate Mr Farage’s use of allowances. An . OLAF spokesman said it had received a complaint, was considering . whether it fell within its remit and whether there was sufficient . evidence to launch an investigation. One . former Ukip member claimed last night that whistleblowers were . silenced, ignored or forced out of the party after daring to question . its use of EU allowances and donations. He . told The Times that Mr Farage had called a senior female official a . ‘stupid woman’ and told her to ‘shut up’ when she asked for an . independent audit into party finances. Another member was allegedly physically threatened. A . spokesman for the party said: ‘These historic allegations come from a . few very unimpressive people that Ukip attracted years ago and who were . gradually weeded out.’ Mr . Farage could also be in hot water with Brussels officials after . admitting in a television interview yesterday that he uses allowances to . travel around the UK campaigning. His . robust defence of his use of allowances provoked fury from the Tories, . who pointed out he has called for MPs who abused the Westminster . expenses system to be jailed. A . senior Tory said: ‘That is the hypocrisy of the man. He says he hates . the Brussels gravy train and then he boasts that he is riding it all the . way.’","Farage claims £15,500 a year to run his office in Lyminster, West Sussex .

"By . Ian Ladyman . Follow @@Ian_Ladyman_DM . The last time David Moyes stood on the pitch at Goodison Park, it was . all about him. This weekend, he will return to find not much has . changed. Moyes' final game as Everton manager last May saw his team beat West Ham 2-0 and he walked off the field in tears. 'If I had been an Everton fan I would have clapped the manager too,' he said. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Martinez or Moyes: Fans in Liverpool give their verdicts . Goodison roar: David Moyes enjoys an Everton goal but times change . On . Sunday Moyes returns with Manchester United as the centre of attention . once again. This time, though, the climate will be different. While he has struggled as manager at Old Trafford this  season, his old club have moved on without him. Everton under Roberto Martinez already have more points - 66 - than Moyes ever managed in a season during his 10 years in charge at Goodison Park, and nine more than United. Supporters, meanwhile, remain irritated by the manner in which Moyes tried to sign Marouane  Fellaini and Leighton Baines last August. By suggesting Everton do 'what is right for the players', Moyes exposed himself not only to accusations of treachery but also hypocrisy. In 2009 he had been critical of Manchester City's attempts to sign Joleon Lescott on the back of similar rhetoric. Fond farewell: Everton fans applaud Moyes after his final match in charge . Man at work: Moyes jokes with his players during a training session on Thursday . 'We haven't forgotten, Moyes,' wrote one Everton fan on a fans' forum . this week. 'And if you have, we will remind you on Sunday.' Football can be a nasty, fickle business. Moyes knows that. The hero-villain cycle can be ridiculously short. The story of Moyes' return to Everton, though, has more layers to it than most. Most surprising, perhaps, has been the apparent attempt by some to sully the Scot's legacy at Goodison Park. Moyes' 10-and-a-half seasons on Merseyside saw him establish Everton as a top . eight Barclays Premier League side during an era when some traditional . rivals moved on to financial footings Everton could not match. As the . club swayed under the effect of aborted takeovers and failed stadium . projects, the team largely remained a constant positive. False promise: Moyes celebrates goal in Munich but Bayern knocked United out of Champions League . New regime: Everton have moved on under Roberto Martinez . Martinez's . progress at the club this season, though, has encouraged some clumsy . revisionism. The Spaniard's team play better football, according to 92 . per cent of those polled on a fan website this week, while stories from . inside Everton tell of superior inter-personal skills. More . surprising, though, were youth coach Kevin Sheedy's Twitter comments . suggesting Moyes didn't care about young players while one of those . teenagers, Ross Barkley, has claimed Martinez's training sessions are . 'more tactical'. Sheedy's words - subsequently deleted - reflected . badly on him and can be traced back to a breakdown in the relationship . between the two men. Sheedy, for example, felt he didn't receive enough . personal thanks when his Under 18 side beat Arsenal in the FA Youth Cup . last year. Nevertheless, the words outraged Moyes and didn't impress Everton chairman Bill Kenwright either. Return fire: Moyes came under fire over his pursuit of midfielder Marouane Fellaini . The . list of players to emerge from youth academy to first team under Moyes . is long and impressive. Moyes was also behind the move to bring the . first team and youth squads together on one site while in 2009 Everton . had five youth academy products in their playing squad. Only United had . more. This week one Everton source told Sportsmail: 'Some academy . staff did feel as though Moyes was slow to blood some of their players. They thought Barkley was sent on loan when he could have been on the . bench here. 'But show me a club with a youth academy and I will show you youth coaches who are moaning. It's always the way.' When Moyes revealed he was leaving Everton that tumultuous week last May, not everyone at the club was sorry. He . had little or no relationship with some senior executives, for example, . simply because he felt his close bond with Kenwright was sufficient. Tough times: Moyes has struggled as  manager at Old Trafford this season . The club's marketing and commercial staff, meanwhile, were quick to wave goodbye. 'There . were some sighs of relief, that is true,' said another Goodison source. 'He was not easy to deal with. The marketing and commercial teams felt . he was taciturn and that they couldn't rely on his co-operation. 'He . hardly came to the stadium on non-match days and few people ventured . down the long corridor to his office at the training ground. 'The . office was right at the end and some felt it was alien territory almost. Very few executives ever ventured down there without an invite and . those invites never came. 'It was, in a way, classic bunker mentality and most people saw it as strategic. 'In terms of results on the field it worked, no doubt about it. It just didn't make him universally popular.' Fever pitch: On Sunday Moyes returns with Man United to Goodison Park . At United there have been similar stories about Moyes as relationships with some non-football staff have been slow to develop. Some . players remain unsure about their new manager also and it will be . interesting to see how many apply themselves as they need to on Sunday, . given their dreadful season is effectively over. At Everton, though, . there were no such playing issues. Moyes is criticised by some . supporters - unfairly you may say - for not winning a trophy while . others point to a poor record against the really big  Premier League . teams. Nevertheless, his Everton players talk of a driven, intense . man who fought their corner for a decade. During his time at the club, . Moyes insisted on the best for his players, whether it be training . facilities or hotels on pre-season tours. He worked his players . without mercy in training. That's always been his way. Some teased . friends at United by text message about the whirlwind of intense labour . that was coming their way last summer but there are many who still thank . him for the impact he had on their careers and their lives. Good move: Moyes has been criticised for his youth policy but Ross Barkley was among those who came through the ranks at Everton . Former . Republic of Ireland winger Kevin Kilbane, for example, leaned heavily on . Moyes after fathering a daughter with Down Syndrome in 2004. 'It's . one of the reasons I respect David so much, because of how wonderful he . was with me at that time,' said Kilbane. 'On the field he transformed us . from a team that finished 17th in the Premier League one season to a . side that finished in the Champions League places the next, even after . Wayne Rooney was sold. 'You never got negatives from him and I played . close enough to him on the touchline to know. He can galvanise a squad . and get the best out of them. He created something special at Everton.' Certainly . only the myopic would argue with Moyes' record at Goodison. Everton . always spent a little more than was made out - Fellaini earned £70,000 a . week while Sylvain Distin earns £60,000 - but Moyes kept the financial . wolf from the door by selling well each summer and, on the whole, . buying astutely. Bunker mentality: Moyes has a reputation for being difficult to deal with . Some now question his style of football - . revisionism again - but fellow managers don't. One Premier League boss . attended a two-day coaching seminar as a young coach given by Moyes in . 2009 and revealed this week: 'He was the first person I heard talk about . false wingers. He had Pienaar and Osman tucking in and the full backs . flying along outside them. 'It was brilliant and is still hard to play against now. It was inventive and attacking. 'Moyes was fantastic that  weekend, an on-the-grass coach who ran his club methodically and meticulously. 'Everton still owe him now and will for years to come.' Boost: United striker Wayne Rooney has been passed fit to face his former club . Whether . Moyes will feel much love back at Goodison - where United have a good . record - on Sunday afternoon is questionable. He deserves a good . reception, of course, but football doesn't work like that. Some feel . Moyes should have given Kenwright more notice of his intention to leave. As it happened, he knocked on his chairman's door only once the news . leaked from Old Trafford. Kenwright, though, is not bitter about . that. He remains grateful for the professionalism Moyes showed in his . final days and he knows how the world works. Many others - as Moyes will  discover on Sunday - do not. David Moyes returns to Everton on Sunday, the club where he built his reputation. His successor Roberto Martinez has had a good first season at the club but how do their records compare? IN A LEAGUE OF HIS OWN . At this stage of the season, Martinez has won more points than Moyes did last year with Everton. EUROPEAN TOUR . Moyes led Everton to fourth place and Champions League football in 2005. It was the first time since 1971 that Everton had competed in Europe’s top competition. Martinez remains in a battle to finish fourth. TOP TRANSFERS . With Romelu Lukaku, Gareth Barry and Gerard Deulofeu all coming in, Martinez has exploited the loan system well this season. But Moyes made some shrewd signings in his time at Everton: .

In just 40 games, Martinez has won 57.5%. That also beats Moyes’ record at United this season — 54% . 66 - Martinez has won 66 points with Everton this season with four games still to play. Moyes' highest tally was 65 points over an entire season — in 2007-08 . AWARD WINNER . Moyes was regularly recognised for his outstanding achievements at Everton.

"By . Scarlett Russell . An archive of images showing the fascinating history of the traditional Easter egg has emerged. To celebrate 100 years since the first . Nestle Easter eggs, the confectionary giant released these vintage . images of how the chocolate delicacy used to be. In the early 1900s the only chocolate spring-time treat that could be bought were in the shape of shoes, chicken, and fish. Chocolate delight: Vintage pictures from 1900s have been released by Nestle to celebrate 100 years since their first Easter eggs were put on sale to the general public . If the shoe fits! The traditional Easter egg was not egg-shaped at all, but in a shoe, chicken or fish shape tied with ribbon, pictured here . They were seen as religious symbols that embodied important aspects of the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus. 'When we started making novelty chocolates in the shape of Easter things we had shoes, chickens, and fish, and no eggs at all,' explains Alex Hutchinson, an archivist at Nestle. 'This . is because in the story Jesus tells one of his disciples that a . cockerel would crow after he betrayed him, which it does after he denies . knowing Jesus to soldiers. 'And after his crucifixion and resurrection Jesus ate a meal consisting of fish with his disciples.' Chocolate delights: Confectionary company Rowntrees made the oval shaped chocolates, left, but it's very different from the modern creations we enjoy today, such as this Chococo egg, right . An assortment of eggs: Rowntress began making oval shaped chocolate when Christian and Pagan traditions merged and signified new beginnings. The first Easter egg was launched in 1914 . Eventually the treats were made from chocolate moulds and they soared in popularity throughout the 1920s and 1930s. There were no eggs made throughout the 1940s because of the Second World War and shortages on ingredients like sugar went on into the 1950s. In 1954 Rowntrees were able to release one single type of Easter treat, a Dairy Box egg, and the novelty chocolates soared in popularity throughout the 1960s to present day. Hutchinson said: 'Easter itself is a pagan festival which is all about celebrating spring and why a lot of the symbols are of hares and nature. Something fishy: The first Easter egg was actually made out of cardboard but contained chocolates inside. Then the design progressed to all chocolate, but in the shape of fish, chicken and shoes to symbolise the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus . Over hare: Easter eggs soared in popularity throughout the 1920s and 1930s. There were no eggs made throughout the 1940s because of the Second World War .

'The early church fathers mixed the Christian celebrations with the pagan traditions and these symbols were carried over. 'Eggs began to make an appearance because they symbolised spring, hope, and new beginnings. 'As time went on England was becoming a secular country and chocolate eggs were more popular than the traditional gifts and they were also a lot easier to make. 'They would have been very expensive and not something that every day people could afford, especially in some of the ornate boxes they came in. 'They were not branded until the '960s when we started bringing out specific varieties like Aero and Smarties themed Easter eggs.'","Nestle have released vintage images of their first ever chocolate eggs .

"By . Sean Poulter . It began with a little red book and a desire to ensure workers received fair reward for their labours. Today, the business is the darling of conservative middle Britain and one of the few to survive the recession with its reputation enhanced. John Lewis is celebrating its 150th anniversary and a unique business model that has worked well both for its customers and the employees, or ‘partners’, who own it. John Lewis (left) handed over control of the business to his son Spedan in 1914, who developed the firm's catchphrase 'Never Knowingly Undersold' In fact the company of today is a reflection of the ideals of Spedan Lewis, rather than his father John who founded the chain as a drapers shop in London’s Oxford Street in 1864. Spedan was not some kind of Chairman Mao of the high street, but a gardener and naturalist troubled by the fact his family’s income was greater than the combined annual earnings of the entire workforce. It was Spedan who gave up his ownership rights to the family business when his father died in the 1920s. In what was a revolutionary approach, he handed it to the staff who would run it according to the rules he set out in what became known in the company as the ‘little red book’ which he saw as an alternative to Communism. This book contained the constitution for the John Lewis Partnership, establishing the ownership rules and setting out a creed of courtesy and integrity that today’s managers are expected to carry on. The little red book, which has been updated many times over the decades, offered a guide to staff on everything from the clothes they should wear to lift etiquette. Partners were reminded that ‘they shall never enter or leave a lift or doorway in front of a customer’. High pressure selling was absolutely forbidden, and there was a strict policy confirming that the customer is always right, threatening staff with disciplinary action if they reacted to those who were rude or unreasonable. A photograph of the first John Lewis store (left) which opened on Oxford Street in 1864 . It was also Spedan who developed the ‘Never Knowingly Undersold’ policy in 1925 which evolved into the price promise to match the lowest figure of rivals. In film footage from the early 1960s Spedan, then in his seventies, talks about how he had ‘an idea for a better way of managing business, so that instead of the many being exploited by the few there would be genuine partnership for all, managers and managed alike, all pulling together for their common advantage’. Waitrose, the favoured supermarket of the middle classes was acquired by the John Lewis partnership in 1937 . Company archivist Judy Faraday said: ‘When he joined the business, the family were taking out £26,000 a year. The total wage bill for the 300 staff was about £16,000 and he thought that was grossly unfair. ‘At that time, there was lots of new thinking, we had the rise of the British Labour Party, Communism and the emancipation of women. He was really rebelling against the authoritarian views of his father.’ The template continues today with the 91,000 staff in its stores and Waitrose supermarkets sharing in the success of the £4billion-a-year business in the form of bonuses. The company is marking its 150th anniversary with an exhibition at its Oxford Street store, where a roof garden will open for the summer.","John Lewis was founded in 1864 opening its first store on London's Oxford Street .

But Rosie Lansbury has proved her strength by reaching the age of two - and thriving. Her mother Tasha, 28, was told her daughter would . probably not survive because a problem with the placenta had halted her . development in the womb. Rosie Lansbury was delivered by emergency C-section when her mother was just 28 weeks pregnant. She weighed just 1lb 4oz and was given a less than 50 per cent chance of survival . Rosie, two, has defied the odds to become a healthy toddler despite being born three months early . But despite being born by emergency . C-section at just 28 weeks, Rosie survived and is now a thriving . two-year-old who is meeting all developmental targets. Miss Lansbury, of Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, said: ‘I keep a memory box of mementos from Rosie’s birth - things like photographs, and the tubes which kept her alive. ‘When I think of how close we came to losing her, I can’t help but cry. The staff at Barnet General Hospital were simply amazing - they brought her to life. ‘Rosie’s my little fighter.’ Miss Lansbury, who works as a taxi controller, said she had no reason to suspect anything was wrong until Rosie stopped moving at 28 weeks. She said: ‘I woke up in the morning and I couldn’t feel her moving. It gives me goose bumps to think about it even now. I thought it would be best to go for a scan to make sure everything was ok. ‘They gave me an injection and waited an hour, but Rosie’s heart-rate started to drop. They said they would have to get her out. Rosie was delivered prematurely because her mother, Tasha Lansbury, went to hospital when she stopped moving in the womb. Doctors soon discovered the baby's heart rate was dropping and she was in danger . ‘Rosie didn’t cry when she was lifted . out of me, and she was rushed off to incubation. I was on sedatives, but . I remember thinking “where are they taking my baby?” It was an awful . feeling.’ Rosie was born on September 12th 2011 weighing 1lb 4oz, even less than the midwives had been expecting. It was later revealed that Rosie had stopped developing at 23 weeks because the placenta had failed to form properly. Two and a half hours after the delivery, Miss Lansbury was finally able to see her daughter for the first time. Rosie was in the neonatal ward, wrapped in a special plastic bag designed to help premature babies stay warm. When she was born, Rosie was so small she was placed in a special plastic bag to help her stay warm . Rosie had stopped developing in the womb at 23 weeks because there was a problem with the placenta . Miss Lansbury said: ‘It was shocking to . see her like that. She looked just like a little raisin - her eyes were . shut and her ears hadn’t formed properly. Her skin was almost . see-through. She didn’t look like a baby at all. ‘I loved her the instant I saw her. But at the same time, she looked so vulnerable that I had to prepare myself for her fading away.’ Two days later, she was able to hold her tiny daughter for the first time. She said: ‘I cried my eyes out. I was so relieved to be able to hold my baby. Up to then, I’d felt so helpless - as if she wasn’t my baby because I couldn’t do anything for her. ‘That was the first time I really felt that she was mine and I became fiercely protective over her. ‘From that day I said to the nurses that I wanted to be involved more - I wanted to feed her, change her and look after her.’ Rosie is still slim and small for her age but doctors say she will catch up with other children by the age of five . When Rosie was two months old, doctors feared they would lose her because she developed an infection . Miss Lansbury said: 'I loved her the instant I saw her. But at the same time, she looked so vulnerable that I had to prepare myself for her fading away.' Image shows Rosie with her older brother, Alfie . There was a tense moment when, at two months old, Rosie fought off a serious chest infection. Miss Lansbury said: ‘I was sure we were going to lose her. It was heart-breaking to think she had been through so much, only to succumb to an infection at two months. ‘She was put back onto a lot of the medication and treatment which she had been weaned from, so it felt like a big step back.’ But finally, after three months, Miss Lansbury was able to bring her daughter home to meet her big brother Alfie, now nine. Today, Rosie is attending preschool just across the playground from where Alfie is attending primary school, and is meeting all developmental targets. Miss Lansbury says until Rosie stopped moving she had no idea there was a problem with the pregnancy . Despite being born so early, Rosie is developing normally and is reaching all of her developmental targets . Miss Lansbury said: ‘Rosie was discharged from monitoring in December and they no longer need to keep a special eye on her. ‘She’s catching up height-wise but she’s still very skinny. The doctors say she won’t be fully caught up until she’s around five years old. Despite her age she’s still wearing clothes designed for 18-month-old children. ‘But everyone’s extremely happy with the way she’s developed. Her motor skills are more advanced than most children her age. She’s running around and loves having conversations with other children at pre-school. ‘At home she’s become my little side-kick. The only person more protective over her than me is Alfie. ‘When I reflect on how close we came to losing her, I’m very grateful to everyone who helped us - the staff at Barnet General, and the volunteers with Bliss, who help families with premature children. ‘It was great to have such support when I needed it most.’ For more information on Bliss, visit www.bliss.org.uk .","Tasha Lansbury, 28, went to hospital when baby Rosie stopped moving .

"By . John Mcentee . Denis Tuohy was anxious. As a 27-year-old TV presenter he'd been chosen as the first face to be seen on the eagerly anticipated new BBC2 channel. It was the night of 20 April, 1964, and he was due on screen in little more than half an hour, at 7.20pm. After rehearsing all day for his historic role that would inaugurate the first challenge to ITV and the BBC's single channel, his stomach was churning and every nerve jangled. Joan Bakewell, The Thinking Man's Crumpet . 'I was in the studio trying to find a way to relax,' he recalls now. 'Suddenly it went black. Kaput! It was as though someone, somewhere, had suddenly switched everything off.' A fire at London's Battersea Power Station had cut all power to a huge swathe of the western side of the capital, including BBC Television Centre. BBC1 was able to switch to emergency recorded programmes from its Alexandra Palace studio in North London, which was unaffected by the power cut. But what about BBC2? The channel - heavily promoted over several weeks by a cartoon kangaroo called Hullabaloo and her joey Custard - was due to begin with Denis introducing a collection of previews called Line-Up, followed by variety acts, a production of Cole Porter's Kiss Me, Kate and a firework display from Southend. 'Nobody knew if the power would be restored quickly, or if we'd be kicking our heels for hours,' says Tuohy, now 77. 'The waiting didn't help our frayed nerves.' At TV Centre everyone was in the dark - literally. 'My editor, Rowan Ayers, rushed in,' remembers Tuohy. 'I asked, ""What can we do?"" He shrugged and said, ""Not much."" We waited in the studio for an hour-and-a-half in the hope that the power might come back on.' John Cleese and Prunella Scales in Fawlty Towers, one of BBC2's most successful launches . It was during this interlude that Tuohy overheard an astonishing conversation between two unnamed BBC executives in the darkened studio. They were blaming ITV for deliberately sabotaging the new channel's opening. Nine years earlier, in September 1955, the launch of ITV had been upstaged by a deliberate BBC spoiler - the fictional death in a fire of Grace Archer, a stalwart of radio's The Archers, an event which made front page news. 'One of the executives was saying that the Battersea power cut was ITV's revenge for Grace Archer,' says Tuohy. He said, ""It's all too much of a coincidence. How did Grace Archer die? In a fire. What scuppered BBC2? A fire.""â€‰' The sabotage theory was soon discounted, however. London ITV station Associated-Rediffusion generously offered to transmit BBC2's programmes, but because they'd have to wait until the ITV schedules finished for the night, this was declined. Tuohy says, 'We finally decided that if power hadn't come back by 9.45 we'd abandon everything and start BBC2 the following night.' The presenter, who was recruited for the launch from BBC Northern Ireland, went home deeply depressed. 'I remember thinking I've come all the way over from Ireland to make my name and look what happened,' he says. By next morning the power lines were back in service, and in spite of all the grand plans for the original launch, the first scheduled programme shown was Play School at 11am. A second launch took place exactly 24 hours after the aborted show. At 7.20pm on Tuesday, 21 April, cameras focused on a darkened studio with a candle burning on a desk. It was the infant BBC2 - at last. Tuohy says, 'Right on cue, I walked into shot and picked up the candle. As the lights came up, I blew it out and said, ""Good evening. My name is Denis Tuohy. This is the studio from which BBC2 programmes will start each evening from now on."" That was it. We were on air.' 'Suddenly it went black. Kaput! It was as though someone, somewhere, had suddenly switched everything off.' Now, half a century after that disastrous night, BBC2 is making up for it by celebrating the anniversary. A cornucopia of special programmes are being planned. David Attenborough, a former BBC2 controller, and Joan Bakewell will be among the pioneers taking part. 'David was the most innovative of all,' says Tuohy, who cites Attenborough's introduction of The Forsyte Saga, Dave Allen, rugby league and one-day cricket. 'He was always very supportive. During his term I was chairing a Late Night Line-Up discussion about . British comedy. Till Death Us Do Part writer Johnny Speight and comic . Marty Feldman arrived very drunk, and it was difficult to shut Johnny . up. Meanwhile, comedy . writer John Antrobus had been in the BBC bar but hadn't been invited to . take part in the programme. He burst into the studio shouting, ""S** the . viewers"", and had to be restrained by staff. The show went out live and I . was told in my earpiece by the director to keep going for as long as I . thought I should. 'Afterwards . I got a call from Attenborough, my boss. ""I've only one question,"" he . said. ""How many drinks did we give Johnny and Marty?"" I said none. ""OK, . fine,"" he said. ""But there's going to be trouble. Leave this to me. And, . by the way, I think you should go and have a drink yourself now.""' It . was Attenborough who introduced colour in 1967. He says he needed a . prestigious series to showcase the new format. 'I wanted to show all the . loveliest things human beings have made in Western Europe in the last . 1,000 years, accompanied by the loveliest contemporary music,' he . explains. The result was the Kenneth Clark triumph Civilisation, now to . be remade by the BBC. David Attenborough, a former BBC2 controller, will take part in a selection special programmes to celebrate BBC2's anniversary . However, Attenborough was critical of BBC2 when it celebrated its 40th anniversary. 'I am not in need of visual chewing gum,' he said then. 'I don't watch soaps, and Trinny and thingy are not going to affect the kind of cardigan I wear. The BBC output has certainly changed and not towards my taste.' Dame Joan Bakewell agrees that BBC2 has changed. 'It doesn't live up to its pioneering times.' Her arrival there, in the summer of 1964, created an immediate sensation. 'To have a woman as one of the four presenters on Late Night Line-Up was exceptional,' she says. 'It was the late (comedy writer) Frank Muir who named me The Thinking Man's Crumpet, which has taken me a lifetime to live down. It was meant as a compliment, but it was a little bit of a put-down, although I couldn't mind.' That disastrous launch night couldn't hold BBC2 back, and it went on to broadcast ground-breaking shows from The Office to Fawlty Towers, Newsnight, Have I Got News For You and Gardeners' World. More recently BBC2 has introduced Miranda, Twenty Twelve and The Great British Bake Off. 'The lesson of the power failure was ""No mistake, no publicity, big mistake, big publicity"",' says . Michael Peacock, the inaugural controller of BBC2. 'Only 7 per cent of viewers could receive the channel at the time. Had the launch gone smoothly, the nation may not have known BBC2 had gone on the air. As it was, everybody knew we hadn't!' BBC2's 50th anniversary celebrations begin with Pop Goes BBC2 tonight at 10pm.","Despite being a successful TV channel, BBC2 had a rocky start .

"By . Rachel Reilly . Men are are obsessed by their appearance and modern life - including the wider and more accepted use of porn - is to blame. Comedian Alex Brooker has investigated the rise of the vain, metrosexual man for a new documentary and discovered that peer pressure, pornography and an omnipresent media are having far-reaching effects. In the programme, which airs tonight, the 27-year-old admits that he is ashamed of his physique so embarks on a series of extreme weight-loss solutions. But along the way, he discovers he is far from alone, with most men having some hang-ups about their imperfect body. Comedian Alex Brooker (pictured) has investigated modern men's obsession with the perfect physique in a new documentary. He discovered that an omnipresent media, peer pressure and that wider use of pornography is to blame . Indeed, more and more young men are embarking on extreme diets, punishing exercise regimes and undergoing cosmetic surgery. A major factor that is thought to be contributing to men's poor body image is the wide use of pornography. The rise of the 'metrosexual man' has seen a whole new industry of men's magazine and products develop . Alex's . friend agrees, saying that pornography 'distorts people's reality' and that . 'even though it isn't real, it does give you insecurities'. Alex . then meets well-known, muscly porn actor Demetri XXX, who explains that the porn . industry's audience and demands have changed over the past decade. 'Before I started working, there were no really handsome or fit guys doing what I do,' he said. 'But since I started working there's been more pressure to look good. It' not just about women. '[Also] it's not just men that watch us now - women and couples watch it together . too -  so men feel more insecure.' Pornography . producer Justin Ribeiro Dos Santos agrees: 'As an industry, we have a . massive influence over how men feel about their bodies. 'Porn is now watched by so many people that, along with other media, we are changing how people feel about themselves.' This . could be said to be reflected in the increasing number of men going . under the knife. 'When . I first started doing surgery around 10 to 15 per cent of my clientele . were men,' London-based cosmetic surgeon Dr Grant Hamlet told Alex. 'But over the past six or seven years, it has grown to 60 per cent.' Indeed Dr Grant has himself undergone surgery to give himself a ripped torso. Physically 'perfect' celebrities such as David Beckham were also blamed for rise in insecure males . In the documentary, called 'Alex Brooker: My Perfect Body', the comedian also interviews his younger brother Elliot, 16, who, along with friends has started to pump iron at his local gym. When . asked why they have decided to get a gym membership, they say that they . want to 'look good, be healthy and get girls'. They have even altered their diet to increase their protein intake and maximise their muscles. They . discuss the fact that their generation was born into a . world where an obsession with posting 'selfies' on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter are the norm. The . teenage friends say that most of their friends doctor their photographs using software such as Photoshop before . they post them online because it is 'so important' to make sure a person . look good in today's society. According to recent research, a growing minority of men dislike their body, with one in three admitting they would give a year of their life up to improve their appearance. Teenagers in the documentary said their friends 'doctored' photos  to look perfect before they posted them on Facebook . Another study found that 80 per cent of men are unhappy with the way they look and 70 per cent are even ashamed of their body. Two in five men are also thought to be on a diet at any one time. Even more alarming statistics suggest that up to 70 per cent of teenage boys are unhappy with their body. And since 2000, the number of male anorexics have shot up by 27 per cent - twice as fast as the growth rate in females. The documentary also finds that the popularity of advertising that employs perfectly honed male celebrities such as David Beckham, is also contributing to the male obsession with appearance. Indeed for the first time ever, men's health magazine's have overtaken men's lifestyle publications. There is also a burgeoning industry in men's fitness DVDs. One man in the programme said 'If you're fat, you're seen as lazy or a loser. Being fat is a sign of being unsuccessful.' Finally, the fact that men, unlike women, can be very vocal about their friend's insecurities compounds the problem. One woman in the documentary said: 'A . woman wouldn't dream of pointing out a girlfriend's imperfections but . men see a mate's belly as excuse to tease.'","Comedian Alex Brooker has investigated the increasing number of men who are insecure about their appearance for a Channel 4 documentary .

"By . Anthony Bond . BBC director general Mark Thompson is to step down from the role this autumn. Mr Thompson announced the move in an email to staff at the corporation today after a meeting with BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten. He said: 'This morning I told Lord Patten that I believe that an appropriate time for me to hand over to a successor and to step down as director general of the BBC would be the autumn of this year, once the Olympics and the rest of the amazing summer of 2012 are over.' Stepping down: BBC director general Mark Thompson, left, is to step down from his role. It follows a meeting with BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten, right . Mr Thompson said he had discussed his leaving date with Lord Patten last year and said he wanted his successor to 'have time to really get their feet under the table' before the next review of the BBC charter which will take place before the end of 2016. In his email to staff, Mr Thompson told them the corporation has 'weathered a series of lively storms' during his time in charge. He took up the role of director general in June 2004 during one of the BBC's lowest points. It followed the Hutton report which led to the resignations of the previous director general Greg Dyke and chairman Gavyn Davies. He steered the corporation through a string of TV fakery scandals. There was also Sachsgate, which saw a public outcry over obscene messages left by . Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand on Andrew Sachs' answerphone which were . then broadcast on Brand's Radio 2 show. In 2007, there was also Crowngate which saw then BBC1 controller Peter . Fincham resign after misleading footage appearing to show the Queen . storming out of a photoshoot was used in a trailer. He also oversaw the move to Salford which has seen around 2,000 staff . move north and some high-profile faces, including BBC Breakfast Sian . Williams, refuse to go. There have also been a number of efficiency drives which have cost thousands of jobs. However, he won respect for the way he handled the early renegotiation of the new BBC licence fee deal last year. Other successes include the launch of the iPlayer which has been a huge hit . and allows viewers to catch up on shows via internet-connected TVs, . computers and mobile phones. He told staff the corporation had . 'weathered a series of lively storms' during his almost eight years in . the top job and was 'so much stronger than the BBC I inherited back in . 2004'. Mr Thompson said: 'Trust and approval are at record highs, our services are in brilliant creative form and we’ve demonstrated beyond contradiction that the BBC can be just as much of a leader and innovator in the digital age as we once were in the analogue one.' He joined the BBC as a trainee in 1979 and worked on programmes including Watchdog, Newsnight and Panorama before leaving the corporation to become chief executive of Channel 4 from 2002 to 2004. Mr Thompson's departure could lead to the BBC getting its first female director general. Its chief operating officer Caroline Thomson is second favourite to succeed Mark Thompson in the role, according to bookmakers. George Entwistle - director of BBC Vision - was declared the early . favourite to take on the top job when rumours first emerged that Mr . Thompson could be on his way out. Whoever takes the job will also have to take a pay cut compared to what . Mr Thompson was paid after Lord Patten made clear the present salary of . £671,000 would not be offered to his successor. BBC Trust Chairman Lord Patten said: 'Mark Thompson has been an outstanding director general of the BBC. He took over during a traumatic period in the corporation's history and subsequently enhanced its reputation for creativity and quality, while setting the course for the BBC's digital future. 'I will miss him on both a personal and professional level and I wish him the very best of luck for the future. The Trust will shortly begin the process of recruiting a successor.' Great shape: Mr Thompson told staff the corporation was stronger than the BBC he inherited back in 2004 . Tribute: Mark Thompson paid tribute to BBC staff in an email announcing his departure . Last week in a speech to the Royal Television Society, I talked about our plans for the Olympics and the other major broadcasting events of 2012. I pointed to the BBC’s current strengths – in quality, creativity and world-class innovation in technology – as well as the big challenges we face both in living within our means and in getting the BBC ready for a digital future. I also commented on speculation about my own future, but promised to tell you and the BBC Trust first when I had reached a view about the timetable. This morning I told Lord Patten that I believe that an appropriate time for me to hand over to a successor and to step down as director general of the BBC would be the autumn of this year, once the Olympics and the rest of the amazing summer of 2012 are over. When Chris Patten became BBC Chairman last year, I told him I thought there was a strong case for handing over to a successor sooner rather than later. From the point of view of the BBC, I thought that my successor should have time to really get their feet under the table before the next Charter Review process got going. I have told the Chairman that I believe that he and the Trust should begin the public process of finding the next DG as soon as they see fit. I will of course help them in that endeavour in any way I can. We can address the exact date of the handover once an appointment is made, though I have made it clear that I want to be guided by the wishes of the Trust and of my successor, whoever that may be. Rather amazingly, with nearly eight years in the job I am already the longest-serving director general since the 1970s. Over those eight years (not to mention three Chairmen, three Prime Ministers and five Secretaries of State!), we’ve weathered a series of lively storms and been through some trying as well as some very successful times together. Hand over: Mr Thompson will stand down following the Olympics this summer . What has made my job not just bearable, but immensely enjoyable and rewarding, is all of you: your talent and energy, your unshakeable belief in the BBC and everything it stands for. I’ve always been on the side of change because I believe that, in the middle of a media revolution, change is the only way of safeguarding what is so precious about the BBC. But change always brings disruption and uncertainty in its wake – and I do want to say a particular thank you to everyone who has worked with me in the difficult task of transforming the BBC. Thank you for your commitment and for your patience. It’s because of your efforts that the BBC I will be leaving is so much stronger than the BBC I inherited back in 2004. Trust and approval are at record highs, our services are in brilliant creative form and we’ve demonstrated beyond contradiction that the BBC can be just as much of a leader and innovator in the digital age as we once were in the analogue one. Now more than ever, to audiences at home and abroad the BBC is the best broadcaster in the world. It’s been a great privilege helping you to keep the BBC in that top spot over the past eight years.I’m not off just yet though and I’m looking forward to working with you over the coming months, as we prepare for the amazing summer of 2012 – as well as for the long-term future, and continued success, of the BBC.","Mr Thompson announced the decision in an email to staff today .

"By . Lydia Warren . A Boston Marathon bombing survivor who lost his right leg in the blast has achieved his goal of walking on his wedding day as he married his high school sweetheart. Marc Fucarile and his fiancée Jen Regan tied the knot at Fenway Park on Thursday, a year after the roofer lost his right leg, broke his left, suffered severe burns and was peppered with shrapnel. The 35-year-old, who was the last bombing victim to leave hospital after undergoing a staggering 49 surgical procedures, had wanted to reclaim the week and create happy memories. He grinned as he left the stadium, using a cane to help him walk on his new prosthetic and the support of his new wife's hand. Scroll down for video . Standing strong: Marc Fucarile leaves his wedding ceremony at Fenway Park on Thursday with his bride, Jennifer Regan. They married a year after the Boston Marathon bombings claimed his leg . Happy: The childhood sweethearts had been planning their wedding at the time of the bombings . The couple, . who have a six-year-old son, enjoyed a day themed with the colors of . 'Boston Strong' - blue and yellow - from bridesmaid dresses to the Duck Tour buses used to ferry guests. Every . detail of the wedding was paid for by the charity 'Love Runs Through . Boston' after Regan entered a competition for an all-expenses-paid day . by penning a letter about their relationship. 'We kind of all read them all . together and we voted,' Adrienne Mendonca, one of the wedding . coordinators, told CBS Boston. 'And I do have to say it was . unanimous for Marc and Jen.' Fucarile, . who had been planning his wedding when the bombs exploded and put the . plans on hold, added that he knew right away that Fenway was the perfect . venue for the wedding. Making memories: The couple are pictured together on the dugout following their vows . Joy: The color theme for their wedding was blue and yellow - the colors of Boston Strong . All smiles: They wave from a Duck Boat as they leave after their wedding ceremony at Fenway Park . 'We were going to get married on an island, a beach or Fenway Park,' Fucarile told Boston.com. 'Once we found out [the reception] would be at the Hotel Commonwealth, I told Jen, ""We're getting married at Fenway Park somehow"".' At the wedding, their vows touched upon their support for each other over the past year. 'They chose vows saying that they would be there forever for love and support,' Justice of the Peace Elizabeth Brennan Gemelli said. '""When you fall I will catch you, when you cry I will comfort you"".' Afterwards, they headed to their reception at the hotel and the Dropkick Murphys happened to be there and entertained guests with a few songs, CBS reported. Family: Fucarile, who was the last victim to leave hospital, and his wife have a six-year-old son together . The wedding came as a day of joy following a tough year for the bombing survivor. He is still trying to adjust to life with his prosthetic, he said, and still uses a wheelchair 75 per cent of the time. Mr Fucarile was watching a friend take part in the marathon with four boyhood buddies from Stoneham, Massachusetts when the bombs went off. After the first bomb detonated, brothers Paul and J.P. Norden huddled with Jarrod Clowery, James 'Bim' Costello and Fucarale, not realizing they were inches away from the second device. When it exploded, both brothers and Fucarile lost a leg, while Clowery suffered burns and shrapnel wounds and Costello was hospitalized with serious injuries. A firefighter rushed to put a tourniquet . on his leg and he was taken to hospital in a detainee van because no . ambulance was immediately available. Together: He is pictured with Jen Regan as he sleeps in his hospital bed at Mass General Hospital last May . In an interview with NBC News in May, he recalled how he pleaded with the firefighter. 'I'm like, 'I don't want to die,""' he recounted. '""I got a little boy and I got my fiancée. I don't want to die."" He's like, ""Just think of them. Just think of them. Keep them on your mind. Just hang in there"".' It wasn't until a week after the April 15 attack that Mr Fucarile opened his eyes for the first time. He spent 45 days at Massachusetts General Hospital before transferring to Spaulding for 55 days. He went to the operating room 16 times, where he underwent 49 surgical procedures. He finally left hospital last July and returned home with his son and future wife.

"By . Simon Jones . This is the Transfer Column, where Sportsmail delivers the very latest news, gossip and rumours from around the football world three times a week. In today's column, Jose Mourinho weighs up a selection of strikers, Manchester United look at Stefan Velkov. Jose Mourinho's protestations that Chelsea would not sign a striker in January have been falling on deaf ears around Europe. Mourinho and his scouting team have been busy since October weighing up potential targets and the same names remain at the forefront of his thinking: Wayne Rooney, Radamel Falcao, Edinson Cavani, Hulk, Jackson Martinez and Christian Benteke. Big moves: Mourinho is planning a big move for a striker, with Falcao (left) and Edinson Cavani (right) touted . Goal scorer: Falcao joined Monaco in the summer but could already be on his way out . Tuesday's defeat to Sunderland underlined Mourinho's summer assessment of his squad that they needed more ammunition to dominate at the top level. A deal for England striker Wayne Rooney was his ideal but the state of that deal remains the same - Manchester United won't sell. The others though are all achievable in January, albeit at a premium price. Monaco have insisted Falcao is not for sale but the player, watched personally by Mourinho in November, is keen to move to a more competitive competition. He was bought for £50million and Monaco would want a profit. Cavani is also interested in a move to the Premier League. Life with Paris St Germain is fine, even in the shadow of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, but again the Premier League or La Liga is the ideal destination. Manchester United like Cavani too and a deal in January for either them or Chelsea would need to hit the £54.3million mark that PSG paid to Napoli in August. Chelsea discussed and bid for Hulk in the summer, offering around £34m to take him from Zenit and the Brazilian has again asked to leave this week. United watched Hulk, among others, against Austria Vienna on December 11 but Chelsea have a good relationship with Zenit. A similar bid in January could be enough. Funds: Porto need to raise funds again, and Jackson Martinez could be out the door . Incredible: Hulk was a Chelsea target in the summer and the striker asked to leave Zenit this week . Porto's Jackson Martinez came on as a substitute for Colombian teammate Falcao in the game Mourinho attended against Belgium in November. His club Porto need to raise funds again following their exit from the Champions League, they want £35million for a 27-year-old who Liverpool considered three years ago when Martinez was playing for Chiapas in Mexico. The question is whether he is good enough quality. He has scored 13 goals in 19 games for Porto this season but only one came in the Champions League - the 2-1 home defeat to Atletico Madrid. Perhaps, purely coincidentally, Aston Villa striker Benteke also played in the international Mourinho attended in November. The Villa man has struggled this season after exploding on to the Premier League scene and has been criticised by the likes of Dean Saunders for not working hard enough. However, some would argue he hasn't had the service and would profit alongside better players. Villa would be vulnerable to offers around £30million. Chelsea home improvements are not just focused on attack, meanwhile, as they look to add a defender and a midfielder. As reported by MailOnline, Fredy Guarin's agent has confirmed that Chelsea have held talks about signing his client from Inter Milan and explained the two clubs are working on an agreement. However, Marcelo Ferreyra, Guarin's agent, told Tutto Mercato that it wasn't done and dusted just yet. He said: 'I'm currently in Milan and I can confirm that Chelsea want to sign Guarin. Nearly there: Midfielder Guarin could be on his way to Stamford Bridge in January . Flying high: Chelsea are hoping to complete a move for French defender Kurt Zouma . Now the British are talking with Inter to try to find an agreement. Only after that we will speak about Fredy's situation. A few days ago we also went to London with Inter officials to talk to Chelsea. Now we need to know what the sporting project is at Chelsea because we are not rushing into anything, we don't just accept any team that come forward. 'Fredy is happy at Inter and he just wants to make the secure choice.' The next target will be for Chelsea to wrap up a deal for French centre-back Kurt Zouma. The young St Etienne defender is serving a ten match ban after being sent off against Sochaux but Chelsea are close to agreeing a deal for around £12million ahead of competition from Arsenal, Manchester City and United. Manchester United are taking a close look at highly-rated Bulgarian defender Stefan Velkov. Velkov, who turned 17 last Thursday on December 12, is at Carrington training with United's U21 squad in the hope of impressing staff and securing a deal. United face competition from Juventus and Inter Milan who are also keen to take a look at the 6ft 3ins teenager. Despite his tender years, Velkov has played 17 first team games this season for his club Slavia Sofia and has already been called up to the Bulgaria national squad. Velkov is a stylish centre-back who is strong in the air, he has represented his country at U16 level up to the U21s where he has been capped five times and scored one goal. Potential: Stefan Velkov (right) is being looked at by Manchester United as a future prospect . United are determined to improve the calibre of youngsters coming through their ranks and want to step up recruitment from abroad. Scouts have also been in Morocco recently to watch some of their young stars from the U17 World Cup. Ironically, Morocco international and Roma centre-back Mehdi Benatia is another player who has been added to David Moyes's lengthy scouting list ahead of January. Born in France, the 26-year-old friend of City's Samir Nasri, joined Roma from Udinese last summer for £12million. Rangers' young goalkeeper Robby McCrorie is drawing in the scouts from south of the border. Manchester United, Manchester City and Sunderland are all chasing the 14-year-old starlet who has already trained with Rangers' first team. McCrorie was outstanding in the Victory Shield for Scotland U16s, and has impressed scouts with a string of top performances. Wigan are considering a move for Sunderland striker Connor Wickham as they face up to the possibility of losing Nick Powell back to Manchester United after Christmas. Wickham is available and has been on loan at Sheffield Wednesday but a few Championship clubs, including Leeds United and Derby, are weighing up offers. Strikeforce: Wigan are considering a move for Sunderland striker Wickham, currently on loan at Sheffield Wednesday . Wigan's budget may help give the advantage to Uwe Rosler who spoke to United last week about trying to keep Powell. Manager David Moyes rates Powell and would prefer to see him step up a level to see how he handles the Premier League. Crystal Palace and Cardiff would certainly be interested in the 19-year-old although the latter may depend on whether Malky Mackay stays. Palace, meanwhile, are maintaining a watching brief on Wigan goalkeeper Ali Al Habsi as he returns to fitness. They have also held discussions about a possible deal for Ghana defender Sami Inkoom, as have Norwich. Inkoom, 24, formerly of Dnipro, confirmed: 'There is strong interest and we have begun negotiations with Norwich and Palace.' Arsenal will send scouts to watch Diego Costa this week but face a difficult task to prise the 25-year-old away in January. Liverpool failed with an offer for Costa last summer and will be interested to see how matters unfold this window with Manchester United also among the strikers admirers. Atletico re-negotiated his contract, doubled his wages and have a £32m buy-out clause which could easily be met but the Spanish side will more likely deal in the summer. Catching the eye: Arsenal are scouting Atletico Madrid striker Diego Costa, who has a £32million buy-out clause . Newcastle, who are scouting in France at Nice and Rennes today, are very keen on Olympiakos striker Konstantinos Mitrogolou. The Greece international has been linked with Liverpool but they have reservations amid their ongoing negotiations with Mohamed Salah at Basle and new contract talks for Luis Suarez. The 25-year-old has scored 21 goals in all competitions this season and is keen to move to England despite the tantalising prospect of facing Manchester United in the Champions League. Greece's economy means a deal can be struck at a reasonable price. Birmingham have signed Fulham's 16-year-old midfielder Wes McDonald on a two year deal. Liverpool's latest wing prospect Ryan Kent has signed his first professional contract with the club. The Oldham-born teenager is widely tipped to make it at the top. Leeds United are stepping up their bid to bring Max Gradel back to Elland Road but face competition from Germany. Bundesliga side Hoffenheim, who are battling to keep hold of winger Kevin Volland, are among those interested in Gradel, 26, who has battled back to fitness following a cruciate ligament injury last season. Return? Gradel moved to Saint-Etienne in 2011, and has scored 10 goals in 53 games . Watford manager Guiseppe Sannino may look, unsurprisingly to the Italian market next month for some quick recruits. Midfielder Alexander Merkel and forward Mathias Ranegie at Udinese are both runoured to be following Sannino to Vicarage Road. JAPAN international midfielder Hiroki Yamada is training with Celtic this week. The 24-year-old plays with Jubilo Iwata in the J-League. Napoli are preparing for the departure of loanee Pepe Reina by scouring Europe for alternatives. Newcastle's Tim Krul, Stoke's Asmir Begovic and Chelsea's Thibaut Courtois are all possibles on their wishlist should Reina opt to join Barcelona instead once his loan from Anfield has finished. Bolton are looking to agree a £1million deal with Turkish side Bursaspor for David Ngog next month. The 24-year-old was a target for Swansea in the summer but has struggled to hit form at Bolton this season and Dougie Freedman is not averse to raising funds to strengthen his squad elsewhere. One familiar name attracting interest already at Bolton is young 15-year-old goalkeeper Will Jaaskelainen, son of Jussi. Cash in: Bolton are looking to raise funds from the sale of David Ngog (left), who has hit form this month . He starred for Bolton in their penalty shoot-out exit to Sheffield United in the FA Youth Cup and caught the attention of scouts in attendance. Bolton coach David Lee said: 'Will is still 15 years of age. It was an unbelievable experience for him to play at the Reebok for 120 minutes and then face a shootout. He came back in disappointed he hadn’t saved any penalties and that says a lot about his character.'","Chelsea striker hit list includes Rooney, Falcao, Cavani, Hulk and Martinez .

"By . Simon Jones . This is the Transfer Column, where Sportsmail delivers the very latest news, gossip and rumours from around the football world three times a week. In today's column, Sunderland striker Ji Dong-Won could make shock move to Borussia Dortmund, Beijing Guoan want West Ham striker Carlton Cole and Man City beat Man United to signing of Norwegian goalkeeper Kjetil Haug. Sunderland striker Ji Dong-Won may not have settled into life in the North East but Borussia Dortmund are willing to give him a chance to revive his career in the Bundesliga. The 22-year-old has shown flashes of what he is capable of in the Premier League including the winner against Manchester City on New Year's Day 2012 but it has been all too fleeting and not helped by an atmosphere of turmoil and change around teh Stadium of Light. Continental drift: Sunderland striker Ji Dong-Won could make a shock move to the Bundesliga with Borussia Dortmund . A loan spell with German strugglers . Augsburg earlier this year raised his profile again and Dortmund have . seen enough in the South Korean to make Sunderland an offer. A deal is expected to be agreed over the coming weeks with Ji having the benefit of not being cup-tied for the Champions League. Dortmund coach sees him as a player who can help soften the blow of Robert Lewandowski's pending departure. Sunderland, meanwhile, are contemplating a move for Reading left-back Wayne Bridge. Manager Gus Poyet brought the best out of Bridge while at Brighton and is keen to solve a problem left-back position. The 33-year-old had a spell at Sunderland on loan from Manchester City in 2012 and may see it as a last shot at the Premier League even though Reading are in the play-off positions. Poyet has also considered options in Italy including Parma's Djamel Mesbah, 29. Change needed? Cole reacts after a missed chance during the dour 0-0 draw with Sunderland . Beijing Guoan want West Ham striker Carlton Cole but need a quick answer from him before they move to other targets. The Chinese are keen to bring high profile players to their league and will offer in the region of £2million a season. Cole, 30, flirted with the prospect of moving to Turkey in the summer before he fought to get a contract back at West Ham. However, he has struggled to cement a regular place. Andy Carroll is due to return and West Ham are continuing to look for new strikers. Beijing don't want transfer sagas of the past and are willing to move for Genoa's Alberto Gilardino should Cole not fancy the move. Alternative: West Ham are willing to move for Genoa's Alberto Gilardino should Cole not fancy the move . Manchester City have beaten Manchester . United to the signing of Norwegian junior goalkeeper Kjetil Haug. The . 15-year-old had trials at City and United earlier this season. The . Sarpsborg keeper has been likened to United legend and his idol Peter . Schmeichel. His father, Cato Haug, told Dagbladet: 'I can confirm that . Kjetil will move to Manchester City this summer.' Blue: Young Norwegian goalkeeper Kjetil Haug has chosen Manchester City over United after his trials . Big move: The 15-year-old was playing his football for Sarpsborg in his native country . West Ham manager Sam Allardyce was in Spain on Sunday night to watch Atletico Madrid against Valencia. Allardyce is in the market for two strikers and a centre-back but West Ham are trying to do all three as loans as they consider the future. David Sullivan has already expressed concerns over the return on their £17million outlay for Andy Carroll and has to be realistic about their Premier League prospects. Search is on: Nikica Jelavic is still on West Ham's radar, but Allardyce was in Spain looking at several others . Rather than risk further financial damages should they go down he wants to safeguard the situation by allowing short term deals with the potential to change in the summer. Allardyce left the stands at Vicente Calderon after 45 minutes with the latest player brought to his attention being Valencia's Jonas. Full name Jonas Goncalves Oliveira, the Brazilian is an important figure in Valencia's squad but they are willing to sell players as they continue to redress their own financial troubles - compounded by failure to qualify for the Champions League. Valencia want £5.3million for the 29-year-old so unless they relent on that stance a deal seems unlikely with West Ham's current policy. Value: Valencia want £5.3million for the 29-year-old as they continue to redress financial problems . The same applies for Southampton's Rickie Lambert and Kenwyne Jones of Stoke with both commanding fees. Everton's Nikica Jelavic remains at the forefront of their thinking, while Nantes' Filip Djordjevic and Anzhi's giant Lacina Traore are other names that have been discussed. Allardyce has also asked for checks on defenders with Porto's Abdoulaye Ba, currently on loan with Guimaraes and Lorient's Lamine Kone among the candidates. Kone, 24, has also been watched by Sunderland and Hull City. Hull's hopes of signing Celtic striker Georgios Samaras have improved after he was asked to take a pay cut by the Glasgow club. The 29-year-old is out of contract in the summer and free to talk to foreign clubs from January. It is understood that Celtic have made him an offer but it would mean his basic pay being cut from £16,000 per week to £14,000. Hull can certainly better that and Steve Bruce will be weighing up an offer over the coming days as he mulls over different targets for his attack. Here and there: Georgios Samaras could be on his way back to the Premier League with Hull City . Rennes winger Jonathan Pitroipa is catching the eye of a few Premier League clubs. The Burkina Faso flyer was voted player of the tournament at the African Nations Cup and has already attracted Southampton, West Brom and Fulham this season. Which . Premier League secretary was sitting very uncomfortably when he found . out the club's new x-ray and medical scanning room would be situated . directly under his office? Voicing his fear that radiation would seep . through, the company fitting the equipment duly obliged by applying lead . lining to the ceiling of the newly-fitted room at the club's training . ground. Newcastle are due to watch Rennes on Wednesday against Bordeaux and the 27-year-old will be keen to impress. However, another player Newcastle will watch closely is developing defensive midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko who has drawn scouts from Everton, Chelsea and Manchester United. The 19-year-old Paris-born player is in his debut season for the first team but looks a star in the making. Chelsea and United watched him on Saturday but also took the opportunity to run the rule over PSG ahead of the Champions League draw and to weigh up any players who may become available from their squad. Shifter: PSG are trying to sign Juventus' Paul Pogba, which could lead to a merry go round . PSG are trying to sign former United midfielder Paul Pogba from Juventus and that could lead to others leaving Paris. Blaise Matuidi, Ezequiel Lavezzi and the small, but very effective, Marco Verratti are all considering their futures and would fit the Premier League well. Newcastle, who remain keen on Everton target, Spartak Moscow's Aiden McGeady, will tie up Wednesday's scouting mission on Rennes by watching Nice also over the coming days. Dundee United have given an contract extension to teenager Ryan Gauld amid ongoing speculation he could yet leave Tannadice. Manchester United sent three scouts to watch the 17-year-old last week to compile reports while Roma, Juventus, Arsenal, Liverpool, Sunderland and Cardiff have also been among the visiting scouts monitoring his progress and that of teammates John Souttar, Andy Robertson and Stuart Armstrong who signed a new three year deal last week. Prospect: Dundee have given Gauld a contract extension to warn off those interested in the young star . Carles Puyol is considering retirement from a persistent knee injury which is accentuating Barcelona's need for a centre-back. David Luiz of Chelsea remains a name in the frame but Barca have also sent scouts to South America to weigh up cheaper targets. Sporting Lisbon are showing interest in Newcastle's Dan Gosling. The 23-year-old has been on loan at Blackpool and was expecting to continue there for the rest of the season. Huddersfield Town have taken Guiseley's Ben Whitfield on trial. Limited opportunities: Gosling (right) is being looked at by Portuguese side Sporting Lisbon . Fulham are considering reviving interest in Sporting Lisbon forward Zakaria Labyad. The 20-year-old Morocco international shot to prominence while at PSV Eindhoven where Chelsea and Arsenal sent scouts to check his progress. However, he moved to Sporting Lisbon under controversial circumstances, with PSV claiming he had broken his contract, but has failed to make any real impression and is looking for a fresh start. Rene Meulensteen has a limited budget but is looking for a striker and a centre-back. Labyad was a target for Martin Jol last summer and could go out on loan but Meulensteen may want a greater physical presence. Return? Fulham continue to attempt to bring former forward Clint Dempsey back to the club for the US off-season . Fulham are continuing to work on a loan for former striker Clint Dempsey at Seattle but Stoke, Everton and West Ham have also asked. We mentioned Anderlecht's interest in Bryan Ruiz last week and meetings are ongoing over that deal but there still remains a difference on valuation with the Belgians coming up short so far. A request to take Ruiz on loan for £1million is not what Fulham were looking for. Rotherham were the only club that had made an enquiry to take Jon Flanagan on loan from Liverpool this season. Sportsmail understands . though that in the week before Jose Enrique's injury, Preston North End . asked if they could take him. Manager Brendan Rodgers said he couldn't . afford to let him go and Flanagan, 20, took his first team chance at . Liverpool instead. No interest: Rotherham were the only side to make a loan offer for Flanagan . The departures of Steve Clarke and Andre Villas-Boas could have bearings on Manchester United transfer exits this January. Clarke was keen on United winger Wilfried Zaha and West Bromwich Albion was understood to be United's preference as long as they got someone else in to replace the England U21 international. Newcastle, Cardiff, Stoke and Everton have also expressed interest. Tottenham's change in manager may affect the future of United's Luis Nani and Javier Hernandez who were both on the list of Villas-Boas. Hernandez, who was injured in training on Saturday, has failed to kick on this season when United needed him to and, if they can find another striker, they may well listen to offers.","Beijing Guoan want West Ham striker Carlton Cole but need a quick answer .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . and Jill Reilly . and Chris Parsons . A Ukrainian teen who was gang-raped, dumped in a ditch and set on fire has died days after she posted a tragic online video revealing her ordeal. Oksana Makar bravely told from her hospital bed how she was raped, strangled and burned by three men in a savage attack which stripped off 55 per cent of her skin. Her harrowing hospital video, filmed by her mother, emerged after medics had been forced to amputate one of her arms and both her feet in a battle to keep her alive. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Harrowing: In the video, Oksana Makar, 18, looks in pain as her mother, Tetyana Surovitska, urges her to describe her horrific ordeal by saying 'a couple of words to Ukraine' Painful: The fire stripped off 55 per cent of her skin and surgeons had to amputate one of her arms and both her feet as they tried and eventually failed to keep her alive . But after a two-week fight for life, health officials in Donetsk said Oksana, 18, died today of severe burns and damage to her lungs. The rape attack on Oksana shocked Ukraine with its cruelty, and also caused nationwide protests against corruption after police initially released two of the suspects who had powerful connections in the region. In the 1:19 minute video clip which emerged earlier this month, Oksana looks distraught as her mother, Tetyana Surovitska, urges her to describe her horrific ordeal by saying 'a couple of words to Ukraine'. She starts to describe the attack, but then breaks off looking visibly upset and says she can’t. The fire stripped off 55 per cent of her skin and surgeons had to amputate one of her arms and both her feet as they battled to keep her alive - her bandaged shoulder can be seen on her right side. Tragic: Oksana Makar claimed before she died she was gang-raped, dumped in a ditch and set on fire by three men . When questioned as to what punishment her attackers should receive after the March 9 attack, the teen replies their testicles should be cut off and fed to dogs. Two of the suspects were Maxim Prisyjnikov, 23, the son of the regional administrator, and Artyon Pogosyan, 21, the son of the regional prosecutor, according to the Hurriyet Daily News. When her mother asks her how she will survive, the blonde-headed young woman says: 'How I will live, I will live. That’s all.' Her mother has been criticised for posting the video online with many users suggesting it was insensitive to her daughter asking her to recount her harrowing experience publicly when 'she is clearly distraught and in pain.' Miss Makar starts to describe the attack, but then breaks off looking visibly upset and says she can’t. Bare necessities: Women's rights group Femen protest naked outside the state prosecutor's office in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev to demand tough punishment for three men accused of raping and set alight an 18-year-old woman . Ms Surovitska has already been accused of spending fundraising money for her daughter's care on herself, as well as charging reporters for interviews. 'Look at me. Do I look like a rich woman?' she said in an interview with a Ukrainian website, Gazeta.ua. The shocking case sparked mass protests across Ukraine and naked campaigners led protests over the sloppy nature of the police investigation and the perceived leniency with which the suspects have been treated. Some Members of Parliament have called for Ukraine to bring in the death penalty for the accused, with one even suggesting the alleged rapists be castrated. The 18-year-old claims she was invited by Prisyjnikov and Pogosyan to their friend Yevgeniy Krasnoshek's apartment, where she was allegedly raped. Outcry: Campaigners were also angry at the perceived leniency handed down to the arrested men, two of whom were initially released over 'lack of evidence' They tried to strangle her to death before wrapping her in a sheet, dumping her in a pit at a construction site and setting her alight, it was alleged in the Kyiv Post. Miss Makar was found barely alive the following day by a man who heard her moaning. After undergoing surgery, she was finally able to recount her ordeal to police. She regained consciousness on Friday, but doctors induced a coma and moved her from a hospital in Mykolayiv to a burn treatment center in Donetsk. In an interview with Gazeta.ua after the attack, she said: 'I could not feel my body. At first, I was screaming for help. 'But there was nobody there, I began to pray. I thought I had died. I remember it all as if in a fog.' The three suspects were arrested, but two of them were released later that day due to lack of evidence, according to the Mykolayiv prosecutor’s office. Prosecutors say they did not question Miss Makar because she was not conscious despite her mother insisting she was able to speak. But anger erupted across the country when a chief police officer confirmed two of the suspects were sons of former government officials, one of whom apparently appeared in a YouTube video calmly describing the attack. Women's rights group Femen staged a topless protest in front of the general prosecutors office in the capital, Kyiv, chanting 'Death to the sadists!' and 'Execute the b****s!' The demonstrations led Ukrainian President Yanukovych to order the general prosecutor to oversee the case and on March 13 the two men were re-arrested and all three suspects were charged with attempted murder.","Tragic Oksana Makar dies from severe burns and lung damage .

"By . James  Nye . Horrifying undercover footage from inside a Californian slaughterhouse shows incompetent workers standing on the mouth and nostrils of a cow to suffocate it after failing to kill the animal with a bolt-gun. The shocking video, which allegedly demonstrates rampant animal abuse and suffering from inside Central Valley Meat Co., has led the the U.S. Department of Agriculture to shut down the slaughterhouse which was a major supplier of their National School Lunch Program and In-N-Out Burger. The sad film produced by animal rights group Compassion Over Killing reveals how already sick cows are stunned when they are unable to walk to their deaths and shows how they are hoisted up by their legs onto conveyor-belts even if the bolt-gun has failed to kill the animal. GRAPHIC CONTENT. Scroll down for video . A cow which is still alive is suffocated by a worker who stands on its mouth and nostril after a pneumatic bolt gun failed to kill it . Most of the animals slaughtered by CVM are 'spent' dairy cows who are no . longer economically viable as milk-producers to the dairy industry. And now USDA regulators who shut down the slaughterhouse after viewing the animal welfare video are investigating whether beef from sick cows reached the human food supply. The investigation will determine whether sick cows were slaughtered and whether meat products from the company should be recalled, said Justin DeJong, a spokesman for the USDA Food Safety Inspection Service. There is no indication any of the cows slaughtered at the Central Valley . Meat plant were diseased and the USDA did not order a recall of beef . coming from the plant. A spokesman for In-N-Out Burger said that CVM provided between 20 to 30 percent of the meat used by their restaurants and that it canceled its contract immediately. The west cost burger chain has a loyal following and is regulalry patronised by Hollywood celebrities such as the soccer player David Beckham. On the firm's website the chain claims to make its own hamburger patties 'using premium cattle selected especially for In-N-Out Burger', and says it pays 'a premium' for this. In a statement to ABC News, the company's chief operating officer, Mark Taylor said, 'In-N-Out Burger would never condone the inhumane treatment of animals, and, in fact, all of our suppliers must agree to abide by our strict standards for the humane treatment of cattle.' The agency suspended operations Monday at Central Valley Meat Co. in Hanford after receiving the video Friday from the animal welfare group Compassion Over Killing (COK). This still image made from video provided by Compassion Over Killing, appears to show workers at a Central California slaughterhouse bungling the slaughter of cows . The footage shows animals bleeding and thrashing after being repeatedly shot in the head with a pneumatic gun in unsuccessful efforts to kill them for slaughter. Federal regulations say that to avoid unnecessary suffering during slaughter, animals must be rendered unconscious by a single shot to the head from a pneumatic gun that fires a bolt through the skull to pierce the brain. The USDA said investigators are trying to determine whether the cows in the video were just lame or sick, which would render them unfit for human consumption. 'That's the main issue right now,' said DeJong of the USDA's Food Safety Inspection Service. Central Valley Meat Co., owned by Brian and Lawrence Coelho, declined to comment on the video, saying company officials had not seen it. A cow starts throwing up after a pneumatic bolt gun fails to kill it as it is transported along a conveyor belt in a slaughterhouse . Another cow bleeds profusely from its nose after a bolt gun fails to kill it at Central Valley Meat Co. in California . 'We were extremely disturbed to be informed by the USDA that  our plant could not operate based upon a videotape that was provided to the department by a third-party group that alleged inhumane treatment of animals on our property,' said a company statement. Brian Coelho added, 'Our company seeks not just to meet federal humane handling regulations, but exceed them.' The video taken by an undercover investigator for Compassion Over Killing also shows cattle lying in pens unable to move, and at least one unable to stand to leave a stock transportation trailer. Some clips show cattle with swollen udders that are unable to keep their legs under them. Other footage shows a downed cow trembling and unable to stand even as workers try to pull her up by the tail. Within hours of seeing the video, the USDA's Office of Inspector General sent investigators who found evidence of 'egregious inhumane handling and treatment of livestock.' Cows lie on the ground at Central Valley Meat Co. in California as they await slaughter . A worker stuns a cow that cannot stand at Central Valley Meat Co. in California . The possibility that animals were being inhumanely treated caused officials to shut down the plant while the investigation unfolds. The USDA had at least two inspectors stationed at the site, and federal officials, when asked whether there was evidence the inspectors had neglected their duties, said the investigation is ongoing. The USDA received hours of videotape from the Washington D.C.-based animal welfare group, which said its undercover investigator was employed by the slaughterhouse and made the video over a two-week period in June and early July. In the four minute video compiled by the animal rights group various abuses towards the cows are witnessed.

One worker appears to be suffocating a cow by standing on its muzzle after a gun that injects a bolt into the animal's head had failed to kill it. In another clip, a cow is still conscious and flailing as a conveyor lifts it by one leg for transport to an area where the animals' throats are slit for blood draining. 'The horror caught on camera is sickening,' said Erica Meier, executive director of Compassion Over Killing. 'It's alarming that this is not only a USDA-inspected facility but a supplier to the USDA.' Online USDA records show the company has contracted to sell ground beef to USDA food programs. A security guard opens the gate at the Central Valley Meat Co., the California slaughterhouse shut down by federal regulators after they received video showing dairy cows being repeatedly shocked and shot before being slaughtered . In-N-Out Burger's have become popular across the west coast and have been served as the Vanity Fair Oscar's party . David Beckham is a fan of the chain and is pictured buying the popular burger's in January of 2012 . 'It's a good sign that the USDA is taking this seriously, but I want to see what comes next,' said Meier of Compassion Over Killing, adding the video will be posted on the organization's website. After viewing the video, famed Californian fast-food firm In-N-Out Burger immediately severed their ties with CVM. The case is reminiscent of a 2008 undercover operation by the Humane Society of the United States at the Hallmark slaughter plant in Chino that led to the largest-ever recall of beef and the conviction of two people found to have treated cows cruelly. In that case, video showed downed cows being prodded with a folk lift.

"By . Helen Collis . The father of NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden has spoken out about how the FBI urged him to go to Moscow to speak with his son. Lon Snowden, a former U.S. Coast Guard, said in interview with the Washington Post, he asked to speak with his son but the FBI told him it wasn't possible. Instead they asked him to visit his son in Moscow. Speaking to Washington Post reporter Jerry Markon, the supportive father said: 'I was asked if I would consider flying to Moscow. And I said ""yes, but however, I want to know what the objective is and I want to be able to speak to my son to see if there is value, because I'm not going to fly to Moscow to sit on the tarmac to be an emotional tool for you, for the government"".' Scroll down for video . Edward's father, Lon Snowden, pictured on the 'Today' show last week, said the FBI asked him to go to Moscow to speak with his son, but said he would not be used as an emotional pawn . Snowden's son Edward remains holed up in the transit area of a Moscow airport, awaiting documents so he can be granted a temporary visa to stay in Russia. He plans to seek asylum in Russia and has spoken of wanting to make a permanent home in exile in South America. In an hour-long interview, the father backed his son's position and described him as 'wholesome' and patriotic'. He said his son grew up in Maryland surrounded by federal agents and law enforcers in his family, but Edward was always the 'brilliant one'. 'I have never known him to be cruel or harsh with anyone at any time,' he said. Snowden remains holed up in the transit area of a Moscow airport, awaiting documents so he can be granted a temporary visa to stay in Russia . Snowden Jr began working in intelligence in 2003, he told the reporter, under the Bush administration; he saw how things evolved, he told the reporter. With the arrival of the Obama administration he hoped that things would change, but Snowden Sr said rather than getting better, things got worse. Since leaking the National Security Documents to Wikileaks, Snowden Jr has been trapped in the transit area of Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport, unable to travel and seek asylum elsewhere because the U.S. revoked his passport. His father believes he is doing the right thing remaining in Russia, since he says the U.S. institutions and media have generated 'propaganda' about his son and he would not be given a fair trial if he were to return. He said: 'Where at this point, unless someone's been living in a cave without a TV, can my son get a fair trial?' He said, based on the behaviour of the U.S. government, both the Congress and Justice departments, he has lost confidence that they are operating in good faith. He described the operations of the U.S. leaders as 'absolutely amateurish'. Anatoly Kucherena (L), the Russian lawyer assisting Snowden, told media at Sheremetyevo airport last week that Snowden has been granted the papers that will allow him to leave the transit area of a Moscow airport where he is holed up . Snowden has been living at the airport for five weeks, awaiting Russian visa papers to be able to leave and seek asylum . He pointed out that to those who believe he is a traitor or a spy, there is no benefit to his son to expose the truth. 'He has chosen to release information at great peril to himself, to expose that people's constitutional rights are being violated by the government,' he said.","Lon Snowden told the FBI he would not be used as an 'emotional tool'

"By . Mark Duell . A council has been accused of painting Britain’s most pointless double yellow lines which measure just 18in - too small to fit a single tyre. Residents were stunned when the lines appeared in Kingston, south west London, curved around a corner kerb at a three-way junction - but barely big enough for a toy car or a unicycle. The lines were today criticised by the Institute of Advanced Motorists, which said it appeared to be ‘another example of strict application of regulations failing the common sense test’. No parking here: Local resident Anthony Smith with the double yellow lines behind the Metro Bank and Wheelwright Arms on Adam's Walk in Kingston, south-west London . Corner: The Institute of Advanced Motorists said it appeared to be 'another example of strict application of regulations failing the common sense test' Motorcyclist Oliver English, who . spotted the lines, said: ‘I think it's stupid and a bit pointless. The . way they've made the access road look pedestrian is very dangerous for . pedestrians and motorcyclists. ‘The pavement feels slippery underfoot and it isn't immediately obvious that it is still a road.’ Another . Kingston resident said: ‘Those lines are just stupid. Not even a . unicycle could park there. What a waste of time. My daughter’s little . toy car couldn’t even fit on that tiny bit of kerb.’ The double yellow lines cover a curved area of kerb which is 18in long. The outer yellow line curve is around 30in. The . lines were . spotted behind Metro Bank and the Wheelwright Arms pub on Adam's Walk. The yellow lines would fit a standard-size shoebox or carving knife, . which are both around 15in long. It could also fit a normal roller blade, which measures slightly less, but . would be much too short for a skateboard, which measures around 31in on . average. Dangerous?

Comparisons: The lines could fit a normal roller blade (left) but would be much too short for a skateboard (right) Neil Greig from the IAM said: ‘The nice flagstones make it clear you are entering a pedestrian area. 'But since you can paint double yellow lines on tarmac, someone has decided they must - no matter how small a section is. 'Another example of strict application of regulations failing the common sense test' Institute of Advanced Motorists . 'The road signs don't seem to be pointing in the right direction to inform any lost drivers, so the area does not provide a lot more clarity over what is legal and what isn't.' A Kingston Council spokesman told MailOnline: 'The short lines simply mark the end of the ""no parking"" zone indicated by the lines on either side of the road. 'Until recently they extended along the street which has been newly paved by developers as shared space (pedestrians and vehicles). 'Without the markings at the corner drivers might assume that they could park there, blocking access to the car park and the shared space.' The shortest double lines in the UK were painted last August between a taxi rank and parking bays in Central London, measuring just over 9in (right). Westminster Council said it was a mistake made by a contractor, and would be corrected. Earlier last year, double yellow lines stretching for just 13in were discovered on a street in Cambridge. Cambridgeshire County Council described the lines as 'common practice'. A spokesman said: 'The yellow lines are at either end of a disabled parking bay and are there to prevent vehicles parked either side from encroaching on the disabled bay'. Council bosses also laid down 18in double yellow lines on parking bays in Highbury Crescent, north London, in 2007. In 2012, double yellow lines measuring just 21in also appeared in Canterbury, Kent (right).","Curved around corner kerb at three-way junction in Kingston, London .

"By . John Hall . Dredgers clearing the flooded Somerset Levels have recovered eight abandoned vehicles from a river - with some of them thought to have been stuck there for decades. Workmen spotted the cars in King's Sedgemoor flood drain near Bridgwater in Somerset while clearing rivers that flooded during the heaviest January rainfall in 250 years - forcing thousands to flee their homes. Although the eight cars were found in a flood drain less than 350 feet apart, Environment Agency officials were quick to dismiss suggestions that the vehicles could have impacted on the flooding. Wreck: Workers in the process of clearing the flooded Somerset Levels recovered eight cars from a drain. It is thought some of the vehicles may have been there for at least 20 years . Not the cause: Although the eight cars were found in a flood drain less than 350 feet apart, Environment Agency officials were quick to dismiss suggestions that the vehicles could have impacted on the flooding . Blockage: Workmen spotted the old cars in King's Sedgemoor flood drain near Bridgwater in Somerset while clearing rivers that flooded during the heaviest January rainfall in 250 years . Loss: Thousands were forced to abandon their homes during the flooding in Somerset earlier this year. Many parked vehicles were completely submerged by the rising waters . Environment Agency officers said that . while it was unclear how the cars got into the drain, it was very . unlikely they were swept in by recent flood water. Some of the vehicles were more than 20 years old and their condition and the water wildlife inhabiting them suggests some could have been stuck in the drain for decades.

"By . Claire Bates . It may look like a gateway in to another world, but these are the incredible images of a ghostly white fogbow. The rare phenomena was spotted by Mikhail Baevsky during a recent expedition to Chatyr-Dag mountain region, in Crimea, Southern Ukraine. Mr Baevsky was part of a trekking group in the mountainous region when he spotted the watery apparition. He was stunned to see it was completely white and quickly grabbed his camera to capture the moment. The fogbow was spotted by Mikhail Baevsky during a recent expedition to Chatyr-Dag mountain region, in the Ukraine . Ghostly: The phenomena appears in mist or fog and appears devoid of colour due to the effect of diffraction . The 61-year-old, from Russia, said: 'I often visit the mountain range in search of the perfect image. 'When I spotted the rainbow it felt really surreal. I am a scientist and I do understand the physics of all these processes but when you are high in the mountains and there are only clouds below you and this white rainbow in front of you it's like looking at a gateway to another world. 'I feel stunned and amazed by nature's diversity and beauty, that's why I can't stop going to mountains, it's full of so many amazing photo opportunities.' A fog bow made from the same configuration of sunlight and moisture as a rainbow, but is made up by far smaller water droplets, which are less than 0.05mm across. This means they are too small to refract light in the same way as in raindrops, which creates the multi-coloured effect. With a fogbow the diffraction (bending and spreading out of light waves) dominates, which robs the bow of its colour making it look white and washed out.

"By . Shari Miller . Super-rich Hans Rausing will move from his Belgravia mansion - where his wife tragically died from a drug overdose two years ago - after snapping up Roman Abramovich's luxury home in Chelsea for £28.5million. The 50-year-old heir to the Tetra Pak fortune, worth around £4.4bn, is said to have paid in cash for the grade II-listed building last December. Now he has submitted plans for remodelling works, which will include landscaped gardens, servants' quarters and a new entrance. Tragic: Rausing pictured with wife Eva, prior to her death from a drugs overdose in 2012 . According to documents submitted to . Kensington and Chelsea council, Rausing will employ garden designer . Arabella Lennox-Boyd to replant the grounds. The . property comprises several conjoined houses, including a grade II . listed Georgian town house and a grade II* listed mansion dating from . the 1670s. Chelsea owner Abramovich and his girlfriend Dasha Zhukova bought the mansion for £25m in 2011. They submitted plans for a lavish £10m basement development, but these were met with fierece opposition from local residents. Previous . occupants of the sprawling mansion, which boasts a 50ft drawing room . overlooking Battersea Bridge, include late Conservative minister Paul . Channon and artist James Whistler. Moving on: Roman Abramovich and his girlfriend Dasha Zhukova, originally bought the mansion in 2011 for £25m . The . exclusive address will provide a fresh start for Rausing away from his . £70m town house in Belgravia, where police discovered the decomposing . remains of his American wife during a drugs raid in July 2012. She . had died from an overdose, but Rausing had hidden her body for two . months while maintaining a desperate pretence to servants that she was . still alive. Rausing was convicted last July of preventing her lawful burial and handed a ten-month suspended jail term. The judge at Isleworth Crown Court said Rausing was a tragic warning of the ‘utterly destructive’ effects of drug abuse. Rausing . - whose Swedish grandfather founded the lucrative food packaging firm . in 1951 - met Eva Kemeny while they were both enrolled on a drugs rehabilitation programme. They married in 1992 and had four children, but both struggled with their addictions. In July 2012 Rausing was stopped by police and arrested for possession of class A drugs. It was during a subsequent raid on his home that police made their grim discovery of his wife's body. Following his trial, Rausing moved out of his Belgravia house to undergo a rehabilitation programme at a private clinic. There was speculation he would move back in following redevelopment work for a subterranean swimming pool, wine cellar and cigar room. However, sources say it will be put for sale later this year.","Hans Rausing, 50, is set to move from his Belgravia mansion .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Winking Jeremie Calo and his date were caught having sex in a restaurant in front of families enjoying meals. Shocked parents and their children lost their appetites when a couple began having sex on a restaurant table in front of their eyes. The amorous pair were ordered to stop by the furious boss at the Florida eaterie. But outrageous Jeremie Calo claimed his date could not stop as 'she can't get up at this time.' The incident came to light in a police report that claimed the 32-year-old and his partner were 'having sex on a table in view of minor children'. That was outside on the patio of Irish themed Paddy Murphy's in Baldwin Park, Orlando. On their website the business reveals it has 'live entertainment' every other weekend and it  encourages visitors to 'enjoy your visit.' This was not what they had in mind. Manager Tom Murphy insisted he tried to put a stop to the couple's fun the moment he realised what was going on. According to police he told the couple: 'Compose yourself, pay your tab or I'll call the police.' That was when Calo claimed his friend could not 'get up.' Passers-by told America's Local 6 news they were appalled parents and children had to endure the scenes. Ashley Webster said: 'That's ridiculous that they would do that out in public, and also in front of kids.' Over the road from the bar mum Jackie Kelvington watched her daughter at gymnastics. Lucky: Manager Tom Murphy called police to the incident where Calo was arrested for fighting with the restaurateur and not paying his bill but the couple avoided being taken in for having sex in public . Yuck: Mr Murphy told the police operator that Calo was drunk and aggressive as shocked passers-by called their behaviour 'totally unacceptable and insane' She said: 'That's totally unacceptable and insane. I'm shocked. I can't believe that. 'I would absolutely yank my kids, get them away from that situation and hope that they didn't see too much.' Police were called to the scene where Calo was arrested for fighting with the manager and for refusing to pay his $101 bill - about £62.50. The couple avoided arrest for the sex allegations because none of the parents wanted to make statements.","Parents left appalled as couple ignored demands that they leave eaterie .

"By . Lydia Warren . It can send any sports player running for the water bottle, but for one college soccer star, sweating can also send her to the emergency room. Caitlin McComish, 20, from White House, Ohio, suffers from a severe form of a common condition called cholinergic urticarial - a hives disorder when her skin is exposed to heat and sweat. It means that running on the soccer field gives her body an intense inflammatory reaction, which causes her to develop hives and her throat to swell, leaving her in need of immediate medical care. The University of Toledo student first suffered a life-threatening anaphylactic shock from the allergy while on a run in her hometown in 2013. Battle: Caitlin McComish, left and right in her soccer uniform, has learned that she suffers from an extreme hives disorder when her skin is exposed to heat and sweat that can send her to the ER . 'I had a really upset stomach, tingly palms and the bottoms of my feet,' she recounted to ABC News. 'I was really, really itchy. It hit me like uncomfortable heat waves. Then I could feel the swelling in my throat, and my tongue got tingly and thicker.' She called her mother, who arrived with an ambulance as her throat was closing. She underwent treatment but by the time she returned to school that fall, she had suffered a staggering 17 shocks - always when she was training. Support: Caitlin (number 30) is now able to manage her symptoms thanks to an asthma medicine . The avid soccer player tried numerous different strategies to reduce her body's response to sweat, including wearing a cooling vest and taking ice baths before practice - but nothing worked. Eventually, she saw Dr. David Lang, chairman of the department of allergy and clinical immunology at The Cleveland Clinic, who advised McComish to receive Xolair injections, an asthma drug. 'Somehow I got to see Dr. Lang, I think out of the grace of God,' McComish said. McComish has noticed a 'dramatic response' and could head back to the soccer field - although an unrelated heart condition has since benched her again. Cholinergic urticarial is actually very common - a survey of 500 high school students showed that 10 per cent had some form. Team member: McComish, second left, has a very severe version of a very common problem, doctors said . 'It's a . condition where people have itching and swelling and the major issue is . heat or sweat as a provoking factor,' Dr Lang said. 'It's . quite common in the general population, but in most cases, it's mild . and patients either aren't aware of it or manage their symptoms well.' For McComish, seeking help and getting to the bottom of her allergy has allowed her to reassess. 'I had a come-to-Jesus moment with myself,' she said. 'I wasn't really worried about my health and I wanted to play soccer. I thought if I pushed it under the rug and kept working hard, it would go away. 'The harder I worked, the worse I got, until my favorite coach said, ""There is a difference between working hard and working smart."" And I kind of had to realize that and simplify my life.'","Caitlin McComish first went into anaphylactic shock during a run last year .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Medic: Capt Bruce Kevin Clark died under unknown circumstances on Monday at an army base in Afghanistan . Foul play is not suspected in the death of an Army captain who died in Afghanistan as he chatted with his wife on Skype, the military reiterated on Monday. Army investigators found no bullet wound in Bruce Kevin Clark's body and they believe he died of natural causes. Despite this, his wife, Susan Orllana-Clark, insists her husband was shot. He lurched forward when he died and that she saw a bullet hole in the closet door behind him, she says. For two hours, she and friends in El Paso, Texas, frantically tried to get help for Capt Clark as they watched him die on an open video link, nearly 8,000 miles away in Afghanistan. The Army is waiting for the results of an autopsy to formally determine the cause of death, however, they have dismissed Mrs Clark's assertion that the Army nurse's death was suspicious. Christopher Grey, a spokesman for the Army Criminal Investigation Command, said Monday that the only evidence of trauma was a broken nose he sustained when he fell forward. An autopsy is being done to determine the cause of death and the investigation is still under way, Grey said. 'But the important thing is that there was no bullet wound, no trauma,' Grey added. 'We can positively say that Captain Clark was not shot,' he later said in a statement. His wife, Susan Orellana-Clark, made a statement on Sunday saying she doubts that assessment. '(Capt) Clark was suddenly knocked forward,' Mrs Clark said in remarks released by her brother. 'The closet behind him had a bullet hole in it. The other individuals, including a member of the military, who rushed to the home of Capt Clark's wife also saw the hole and agreed it was a bullet hole.' Mrs Clark sat in in El Paso, Texas, and watched the computer screen helplessly for two hours on Monday as she frantically tried to contact her husband's colleagues 8,000 miles away in Afghanistan to get him help. Finally, two Army personnel arrived in . Capt Clark's room and checked his pulse. They did not, however, tell Mrs . Clark what had happened to her husband, the family said. A spokesman at the William Beaumont . Army Medical Center in Texas, where Capt Clark was stationed, told MailOnline on Friday that the officer's death came from natural causes and was not combat-related or . suicide.

Mrs Clark said she decided to go . public with the bullet hole detail 'to honor my husband and dispel the . inaccurate information and supposition promulgated by other parties.' Cpt . Clark was chatting online with his wife, he suddenly looked 'alarmed' and disappeared from his wife's computer screen during a conversation on . Monday, according to an Army spokesman. 'Mrs Clark was Skypeing from the family home here in El Paso with her . husband when he all of a sudden fell away from the computer keyboard and . fell out of sight,' said Colonel John Modell. 'He assumed an alarmed look and fell back out of the picture,' he continued. Clark . was assigned to the William Beaumont Army Medical Center in El Paso and . deployed in March. He is survived by his wife and two daughters, aged . three and nine. Respects: Clark was assigned to A Company, Troop Command, William Beaumont Army Medical Center, El Paso, Texas and was deployed in March . U.S. and Australian special operations soldiers in Afghanistan honored Clark this week, according to the statement. Clark was assigned to A Company, Troop Command at Beaumont. According to the El Paso Times, his . awards and decorations include the Army Commendation Award, Military . Outstanding Volunteer Service Medal, National Defense Service Medal, . Global War on Terrorism Service Medal and the Army Service Medal. On Thursday night flags flew at half-mast in the Addison, Michigan, area where his mother Cindy Hallenbeck lives and a donation jar with his picture on it was set out by a local store. A Facebook page has been created in Clark's honor and tributes have been flooding in. A friend wrote on his Facebook page: 'The love Bruce had for his wife and girls is what I remember the most. He was a string nurse who was always a team player. We will miss him! Just consider myself lucky to have met him.' Army: Captain Clark was a Texas-based medic who was deployed to Afghanistan in March . Patricia Robledo wrote: 'The love Bruce had for his wife and girls is what I remember the most. He was a string nurse who was always a team player. We will miss him! Just consider myself lucky to have met him. Former Addison firefighter Ed Lawson wrote: 'More than just helping me learn the ropes at the (fire department), he helped me learn that being strong and being compassionate can go together. He never knew it but in his way, he also helped me find my way back to God. Awesome man, husband and father, friend who is missed already.' Shortly after moving to Spencerport in 2000, Clark and his wife had a daughter. As he worked as a volunteer firefighter, Clark enrolled at The College at Brockport, where he decided to pursue a career in nursing. When he was approached about joining the military, he decided to pursue both passions as he 'really wanted to serve his country'. After graduating in 2006, Clark moved his family to Hawaii, where he was stationed. There, he had another daughter. His next assignment was in El Paso, Texas. He rose to the rank of Captain and Chief Nurse, according to YNN. His sister-in-law Mariana told the news channel they are still in the dark about what happened: 'There really still is a big question mark. 'On Tuesday, military called my sister and told her that Kevin had not made . it, and that there would be an investigation and that was the only . thing they would tell her.' No matter how he died, Mariana knows it was in service of his country; . putting others before himself. That's the way, she says, he deserves to . be remembered.

"By . Suzannah Hills . Cuba's reclusive former President Fidel Castro has been photographed in public for the first time in almost a year. The revolutionary leader attended the inauguration of an art gallery in Havana run by Cuban artist Alexis Leyva, aka Kcho, yesterday. It is the first time Castro has been seen in public since attending a National Assembly meeting in February 2013. Public appearance: Fidel Castro, Cuba's former President and revolutionary leader, looks at the camera during a rare public appearance to attend the inauguration of an art gallery in Havana, Cuba . Support: Castro is helped into the gallery by an aide and a metal walking stick . Castro, who ceded power to his brother Raul Castro in 2008 after falling ill in 2006, has kept a low profile in recent years. But his silence in the wake of Nelson Mandela's death prompted widespread speculation that his health is ailing. The former South African president was a close ally, thanks to Cuba's backing of Angolan fighters who battled forces supported by the previous pro-apartheid South African government of the 1980s. This prompted the release of pictures in December of Castro meeting with a Spanish reporter about current events for more than two hours earlier that month. Recluse: The appearance is the first time Castro has been seen in public since attending a National Assembly meeting in February 2013 . Speculation: Castro's low profile prompted fears about the state of his health . The photo shows Castro, 87, seated and wearing a blue sweatsuit, looking intensely at writer Ignacio Ramonet and gesturing with his left hand. Mr Ramonet and the website Cubadebate say the photo was taken early December. The reporter told the AP that he and Castro discussed a wide range of topics including Mandela, Venezuelan politics and climate change. 'I found him to be in excellent health and in a good mood, physically, mentally and psychologically,' Mr Ramonet said. Castro left power after 47 years after suffering serious intestinal bleeding in 2006, handing his duties to his brother Raul.

Poor health: Castro left power after 47 years after suffering serious intestinal bleeding in 2006 . While Fidel Castro has been out of the spotlight due to his health, his brother Raul has been making enough headlines for them both as he caused a stir after shaking President Obama's hand during the public memorial ceremony for Mandela in South Africa. It then emerged that representatives from the two historically antagonistic nations had already been in talks for six months. During the president's trip back from South Africa, Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters on Air Force One that 'it's been quite some time since the Presidents of the United States and Cuba were even in the same place.' But he acknowledged that 'we’re in talks on issues associated with migration that, again, I think allow for there to be greater connectivity particularly among Cuban Americans and Cuba.'

"By . Snejana Farberov . A 9-month-old baby boy from California was pronounced dead Wednesday after he was left alone in his father's hot car for 10 hours. According to police, the San Jose resident forgot to drop off his son at his babysitter's home before heading to work and only learned of what happened when he returned to pick up his car. Just after 7pm Wednesday, officers received a 911 call about an unresponsive baby in the backseat of an SUV parked in the 3700 block of Payne Avenue in San Jose. Scroll down for videos . Fatal mistake: A San Jose, California, father, forgot to drop off his 9-month-old son at his babysitter's home and left the boy to die of heat in the backseat of his parked SUV . First responders who arrived on the scene pronounced the child dead from a suspected heat stroke a short time later. Temperatures hovered around the 80-degree mark Wednesday, but inside the locked car it was likely at least 20 degrees hotter, NBC Bay Area reported. The boy's father, who also has two older children, followed his usual routine Wednesday morning, parking his silver Honda SUV on Payne Avenue before switching to his work vehicle - a large box truck stocked with supplies for vending machines. The dad, whose work hours are 9am to 6pm,  had made arrangements to drop off the 9-month-old at his sister-in-law's house, but there was some 'misunderstanding.' When the father and son failed to show up at her home, the woman concluded that someone else must have been caring for the infant that day, according to ABC7 . Routine: Every morning, the dad would park his SUV on Payne Avenue and switch to a delivery truck . Yousif Nijmeh, whose brother owns the company where the father of three works as a deliveryman, told the NBC station that the man loved the baby 'most in the whole world.' Witness: Yousif Nijmeh, a brother of the father's boss, said he was working on his car just steps away from the SUV but had no idea there was a baby inside because of tinted windows . Nijmeh was in the area working on his car all day Wednesday, but said he had no idea that the little boy was dying in the backseat of the SUV just steps away because the vehicle had tinted windows. When the father finished his workday and came back to pick up his car, Nijmeh witnessed the man breaking down and sobbing uncontrollably at the sight of his unresponsive son in the sweltering backseat. ‘He's a very responsible father who was so proud of the baby,’ he said. ‘The baby was like a gift from heaven for them.’ So far, the father has not been arrested, but the case will be forwarded to the District Attorney's Office. It is believed to be the first fatality this year involving a child left in a car. According to the organization Kids And Cars, last year, 32 children died from heat stroke after being forgotten in a vehicle. Since 1991, there have been 647 cases nationwide – 51 of them in California.","Temperatures in San Jose, California, were at around 80 degrees Wednesday, but it was over 100 degrees inside the car .

"By . Ashley Collman . Marijuana may feel like a god-given right to Colorado residents following the legalization of recreational pot, but like bottled water, sharp objects or lighters, it's one of the many things that still aren't allowed on planes. In a show of mercy, the Colorado Springs Airport has installed amnesty boxes where passengers who accidentally bring pot into the airport can surrender it without facing fines of up to $2500 or even possible jail time if caught with the controlled substance. Like amnesty boxes for other banned items, passengers can drop off the pot before going through security but unfortunately won't be able to get it back as it will be destroyed by the police. Drop-off: Recreational pot is legal in Colorado now, but still banned in airports. Colorado Springs airport is currently in the process of installing amnesty boxes for passengers to deposit their pot if they accidentally bring it into the airport . While recreational marijuana was made legal in Colorado this year on January 1, it is completely banned in all areas of the airport due to federal aviation regulations which make it illegal to operate a civil aircraft with the knowledge that marijuana is on board. The Colorado Springs airport officially outlawed pot in the airport on January 10, following Denver International Airport which put up signs warning that the substance was banned before legalization in the new year. It's unclear whether similar amnesty boxes had been set up at the Denver Airport. MailOnline's calls to the airport were not immediately returned Wednesday morning. Amnesty boxes for the Colorado Springs airport were being shipped after the prohibition and are expected to be installed sometime today. Officials are recommending that people leave their marijuana in the car before entering the airport. New rules: Recreational marijuana was made legal in Colorado on January 1, but it's still not allowed in the airports. Above, a marijuana growing facility gets ready to open before the legalization deadline . The ban applies to all airport entrants, including those with medical marijuana perscriptions and those traveling within the state and to other states where the substance is legal (like Washington). According to the new law, all Colorado residents over the age of 21 are allowed to purchase up to an ounce of recreational marijuana while out-of-staters can buy a quarter-ounce. Marijuana bought in the state is not allowed to be transported across state lines, which is another reason the airports have instituted the ban. Some 136 retail stores have been issued cannabis licenses this year and apparently demand is so high that many have been running out of inventory.","Recreational marijuana was made legal in Colorado on January 1 .

"By . Alex Greig . A California town has passed a smoking ban that city officials are calling the most stringent in the country. The San Francisco town of San Rafael, a community of about 57,000 people, passed the ban, which prohibits lighting up in all duplex and multi-family residential units that share a common wall. The law applies to both renters and owners and includes residences such as condos, co-ops, apartmentrs and any residence with three or more units. Smoking ban: Residents in San Rafael, California cannot smoke in their own homes if they share a common wall with other residences . 'We are happy to blaze a trail,' Mayor Gary Phillips said before the vote. 'We're most happy to be in the forefront of the issue because we think it will greatly benefit our residents and those visiting San Rafael, and we think it will set the tone for other cities as well.' The ordinance also made it illegal to smoke outside in downtown San Rafael unless the smoker is 'actively passing' on their way somewhere else. Smoking in parks and recreation areas, outdoor dining areas and in service areas (ATMs, bus stops) is also prohibited. Pam Granger, advocacy manager for the American Lung Association in California told NBC that San Rafael is the state's ninth municipality to completely restrict smoking in multi-unit housing. In 1977, nearby Berkley became the first city in the world to restrict smoking in restaurants. Regulations: Critics of the new rules say the government should not be able to dictate if people smoke inside their own homes . Rebecca Woodbury told ABC News that the studies show secondhand smoke can seep in through ventilation ducts and walls. According to a 2006 Surgeon General's report, secondhand smoke kills an estimated 50,000 Americans each year. Asked if there was opposition to the ordinance, Woodbury said there was hardly any. 'We have a very low percentage of smokers in the county,' she said. Some though, believe the government should not be able to dictate whether or not people smoke in their own homes. Smoke-free town: Other prohibitions include smoking in San Rafael's downtown area, smoking in parks and smoking in outdoor eating areas . 'This proposed smoking ban actually intends to punish people for what they do in their own homes,' Thomas Ruppenthal told the council. 'I really feel this is tyranny.' George Koodray called San Rafael's new ruling 'mischevious.' 'I don't believe it's rooted in science,' Koodray, who is president of the Metropolitan Society, a group of New Jersey cigar smokers, told ABC News. 'Someone smoking in a sealed apartment endangers the health of others in the building? The science for that is spurious at best.'","California's San Rafael has passed a strict smoking ban .

All over the internet through social networking, image-sharing and news websites, we are exposed to a vast array of pictures. And, as these incredible images show, it is this relatively new cultural phenomenon which inspired Dutch artist Erik Kessels with his latest installation. Swamped: Erik Kessels has created this incredible room of pictures after downloading and printing out every picture uploaded to Flickr in 24 hours . He has created this amazing room of one million images after downloading and printing out every picture uploaded to Flickr in a 24-hour period. For his project, Photography In Abundance, he wanted to give visitors the opportunity to grasp the immense scale of just how many photos are shared on one site on a daily basis. Speaking to Creative Review, the artist said: 'We're exposed to an overload of images nowadays. Image overload: A young boy sits back and enjoys a single picture he chose out of the one million images he could have picked from at Eric Kessels' exhibition in Amsterdam . 'This glut is in large part the result of image-sharing sites like Flickr, networking sites like Facebook, and picture-based search engines. 'Their content mingles public and private, with the very personal being openly and unselfconsciously displayed.

"By . Alex Greig . Getting high is going high-end in Colorado, where the state's 'ganja-preneurs' are cashing in on white-collar cannabis enthusiasts desire to partake in a refined environment. Now that Colorado citizens can buy marijuana for recreational purposes legally, catered pot parties are the new wine and cheese mixers. Event planner Jane West of Edible Events threw her first weed-friendly event at downtown Denver's high-end Space Gallery. Ganja-preneur: Jane West dreamed up Edible Events to create parties where people can consume cannabis along with quality food and drink in the company of like-minded weed-enthusiasts . Pairing cannabis with canapes is a winning formula for West, whose guests forked out $125 per ticket for the sold-out event where the wine and food were provided but the weed was BYO. West, 37, dreamed up the event soon after Colorado became the first U.S. state to legalize the sale of cannabis for recreational use. She quickly realized that there was a market for a more discerning demographic to consume pot in a social environment. 'When I looked around Denver there was nothing that really fitted my demographic, that I felt comfortable with,' she told the UK Telegraph. The inaugural party for Edible Events was themed End of Prohibition, and photographed by cannabis education group Kind Reviews. Recreational: Cannabis is becoming more popular with professional women, who love the lack of hangover and the relaxation it provides . High brow: Surrounded by artworks, guests chat, eat and consume cannabis at West first party, themed End of Prohibition . Munchies: Edible Events is fully catered with foods your average stoner can only dream about . Among her guests are sisters Candy Nuss, 59 and CynDee Williams, 62, dressed smartly, their silvery hair perfectly coiffed. Successful real estate broker Wendy Bruner, 67, also enjoyed the event, telling the Telegraph that she never liked to smoke and hates the taste of alcohol but loves the high cannabis gives her when she consumes it in the form of cakes and granola bars. 'It blows my mind how many people our age are doing it. My brain's always racing and it mellows me out. It just takes all the worry out of things. I think people will realise this is not a stepping stone and you're not going to be a cocaine freak in three months,' she said. Edible Events' soirees, to be held monthly hereafter, 'combine visually stunning venues with decadent food and libations to create a unique, unforgettable evening affair' and showcase the best Denver has to offer in 'the culinary, cannabis and art scenes,' according to the company's Facebook profile. 'I decided to have events that I would like to attend. It's really about normalising cannabis, making using it as ordinary as ordering a glass of wine. This is for people who would go to an art gallery opening, or a four course dinner, but also like cannabis,' West told the Telegraph. Pot party: Guests brought their own vaporizers, cannabis-infused baked goods or joints to the event . All aboard: The luxury bus where guests could smoke instead of huddling in a corner of the parking lot as in days of old . High times: Colorado is blazing trail after becoming the first state to legalize the sale of marijuana for recreational use . Her guests brought their own cannabis in the form most pleasing to them - edible, vaporiser, joint - and in turn were provided with a delicious menu of weed-friendly foods such as chicken parmesan lollipops in sofrito and brie, mango and poblano chilli quesadillas. The food is specifically designed with the weed-consumer's mouth in mind, moist with sauces, cheese and cream and full of more-ish flavors. 'Munchies for foodies,' West calls it. It's a far cry from the stereotype of the dim stoner slacker munching down a bag of Cheeto's and watching Beavis and Butthead. Guests who preferred to consume their weed the traditional way - rolled and smoked - were provided with a luxury bus bedecked with peacock feathers where they could smoke to their hearts' content. The company's goal, reads the Edible Events Facebook page is to 'maximize your cannabis experience and stimulate your heightened awareness of taste, smell and sight.' Tunes: A dj spins some tracks to enhance the mellow vibe . Wrapped up: The burgeoning cannabis economy is creating new business opportunities for entrepreneurial Coloradans . The conversation flowed at the inaugural Edible Events cannabis party . 'I wanted to create an event where consuming cannabis is just the same as consuming alcohol, so it's really just normalizing it,' she said. 'I donâ€™t want to use the word ""pot"" or ""weed"" or ""smoke"" or ""joint,""' West told The New York Times. 'If we redefine it as consuming cannabis, then maybe people will be more open to that. There are only so many hoodie-wearing stoners in town. This needs to be opened up to other demographics.'","The first Edible Events party was held in Denver Saturday, catering to the city's well-heeled cannabis enthusiasts .

"By . Ruth Styles . For Vanessa James, a mother who thought little of climbing a tree or leap-frogging into the monkey pen during visits to the zoo was nothing out of the ordinary. And yet, her childhood, unusual though it was, was eclipsed by that of her mother, Bradford housewife Marina Chapman, who was brought up not by a human family but by a troupe of monkeys. Now Vanessa has spoken out ahead of a new National Geographic documentary that sheds further light on Mrs Chapman's extraordinary story and reveals what happened when she finally returned to the Colombian jungle more than half a century later. Marina Chapman and Vanessa James in front of mural in Bogota, Colombia - . Extraordinary: Vanessa James' mother Marina (pictured) was raised in the Colombian jungle by monkeys . Marina Chapman's incredible tale began at the age of four when she was kidnapped and abandoned in the jungle by the unscrupulous gang that took her. Terrified and alone, the little girl was discovered by a troupe of Capuchin monkeys who adopted her, teaching her how to feed herself, climb trees and escape from predators. By the time she was found, five years later, she could no longer communicate with humans and was living a wild Mowgli-style existence. Marina Chapman back in the jungle at Las Unamas nature reserve, Bogota, Colombia . Taking advantage of her vulnerability. Mrs Chapman was sold to a brothel in the northern city of Cucuta, where she was regularly beaten. After escaping, Mrs Chapman, who by then was calling herself Marina Luz, met Bradford-based scientist John Chapman and emigrated to the UK where she has lived ever since. Earlier this year, Mrs Chapman caused a furore when her incredible story came to light following the publication of her autobiography, The Girl With No Name. Monkey business: Despite having lived outside of the jungle for 50 years, Marina has some primate-style habits . Cool mum: Vanessa says she wouldn't change a thing about her mother - including her lingering fondness for climbing trees . But for daughter Vanessa, the revelations came as no surprise whatsoever. 'She didn't really have a moment where she sat down and told us, it just kind of naturally came out,' she explains in an exclusive interview with MailOnline. 'During dinner parties, people would ask, and information would come out, and we would wait to hear more of her stories. Growing up with her was an amazing experience.' And Mrs Chapman's monkey memories weren't confined to dinner table conversation. According to Vanessa, her mother still, at times, behaves as if she were still in the jungle. 'We've always known how mum is and it's hard to believe she was raised normally,' she adds. 'She loves climbing trees and having fun and adventures. 'She just has different priorities and she really struggles with lying. It's all very practical so that kind of makes sense with her background.' And despite the passage of more than half-a-century since her jungle childhood, Vanessa says her mother has never lost her love for the Capuchins who raised her. 'Her passion and excitement for them has never died down,' she explains.'But she has forgotten the language and a lot of the culture.' Rather wonderfully, Vanessa also tells of her mother's overwhelming excitement when confronted by the chance to see monkeys - even in a zoo. 'We would go to Monkey World, and she wouldn't speak all day,' remembers Vanessa. 'She'd be planning to jump over the fence and her pockets would be full of fruit and feed.' Friendly: Marina was raised by Capuchin monkeys, similar to this adorable mother and baby . She would even display monkey-like behaviour with her children, and, according to Vanessa, would spend hours grooming them. 'When we were growing up, it all seemed normal, including family grooming time when she would scratch our backs and pick through our hair,' she reveals. A dramatic reconstrucion of a very young Marina in the jungle, filmed in Las Palmas, Tenerife, Spain . 'She would play with animals all the time, climb trees and you could see that she climbs in a different [monkey style] way.' Unconventional though her own childhood might have been, Vanessa, who co-authored her mother's autobiography, wouldn't change a second of it. 'It was the best,' she enthuses, adding: 'I wouldn't want to change anything - I definitely had a cool mum! 'Her perspective on life is really different: she never pities and she doesn't judge. She raised us to be really strong and that's a great way to grow up.' Woman Raised by Monkeys premieres next Thursday, 12th December, at 9pm exclusively on the National Geographic Channel .","Vanessa James is the daughter of Bradford housewife Marina Chapman .

"By . Marie-louise Olson . Car insurance company AAA is warning people against taking selfies while driving, saying ‘it can kill’. This comes just a few days after the word ‘selfie’ was voted Oxford Dictionary’s 2013 word of the year. The word beat tough competition from twerk, binge-watch and showrooming, as editors said the word has evolved from a niche social media tag into a mainstream term for a self-portrait photograph. Selfies: Driving while taking a picture of yourself is not a good idea as it could end in a car accident . Car selfie: A girl posts a picture of herself on Twitter while in her car. The AAA says these acts are likely to cause an accident if the vehicle is in motion . But AAA officials in Salt Lake City, . Utah, say the new phenomenon is distracting drivers as millions of . people post them on social media. Some . drivers have admitted to doing it, according to Fox13, saying they do . it usually when they are stopped at a light, not while moving. AAA’s . research shows taking a photo for two seconds while driving means your . eyes are off the road for nearly half a football field. ‘Don’t let that driving selfie or video be the last photo you ever take,’ officials said. Picture time! Leave the photo taking to your friends in the backseat who are not driving . With . six-second videos popular on Vine and 15-second videos, the latest . feature on Instagram, drivers are distracted for the distance of up to . nearly four football fields. ‘You can certainly kill yourself as well as kill other people as well,’ said Rolayne Fairclough with AAA Utah. Fairclough said it depends . on the speed a person is traveling, but that five seconds is a 'great deal of . distance especially if you’re in inclement weather or in traffic things . can happen and you really need to be focused on the road'. 'You can kill yourself': Rolayne Fairclough with AAA Utah says taking a selfie while driving is deadly . 'Annoyed': This driver posts an Instagram photograph of himself on his way to work, saying the other drivers were getting on his nerves . Currently, . Utah has a law against texting while driving.

"By . Associated Press . and Ashley Collman . A 17-year-old high school student on Spring break and her aunt were found dead, floating in western Lake Erie Thursday morning after they never returned home from a fishing trip. Searchers found a partially submerged boat on a reef near the Davis-Besse nuclear power plant and later spotted the bodies of 33-year-old Amy Santus and her niece Paige Widmer wearing life jackets, authorities said. The two went out on the lake Wednesday afternoon for a fishing trip with two men and even sent pictures on the boat back to relatives. Dead in the water: The bodies of 33-year-old Amy Santus (left) and her 17-year-old niece Paige Widmer (right) were pulled from western Lake Erie on Thursday after the two went missing with a fishing party of four Wednesday night . But when the group didn't return home that night as planned, family reported them missing. The search for the fishing party started around 2am Thursday, and the 21-foot-long boat was found miles from shore around 6:30am. The bodies of the two women were found a few hours later. Coast Guard continued to search for the two other men reported missing by boat and helicopter for the rest of the day, but called off the search Thursday night due to water conditions. While the two men have not yet been named by officials, one of the men has been identified as 33-year-old Andrew Rose of Maumee, in the Toledo Blade. Scouring the lake: Searchers found the missing boat around 6:30am and the two bodies a few hours later. They continued the search for the other two missing for the rest of the day . Christopher Titus, a friend of Mr Rose, says he learned about his friend's disappearance late Wednesday and says Mr Rose was a close friend of Amy Santus. Mr Rose is a bartender at Home Slice Pizza in Toledo, Mr Titus said. 'He lived to be outside. If he wasn't on the water he was hunting,' Mr. Titus said. 'I am sorry to hear what happened to Andrew and the others. My thoughts and prayers are with their families.' The average water temperature within the search area was about 35 to 40 degrees, the Coast Guard said. How long people can survive in water that cold depends on their weight, gender and what they were wearing. Authorities narrowed the search to an area about 30 miles east of Toledo after finding the boat. They continued to search for the two men today, even though their survival window in the water is only about 8 hours. Still missing: The Coast Guard called off the . search for the  other two men reported missing on the boat Thursday . night, due to water conditions . 'If these people were still findable our forces would have found them by now,' a search official said Thursday. The cause of the boat accident has not yet been determined since the focus has been at finding the missing passengers. Officials don't believe alcohol was a factor. A cause of death for the two women has not been released either. The boaters' truck and boat trailer were found at a marina where they headed out on the lake. Paige Widmer was from Pelion, South Carolina and was visiting family in the area for her Spring break. She played varsity volleyball for her high school, and classmates gathered Thursday afternoon to hold a vigil in her honor.","Paige Widmer, 17, and her aunt Amy Santus went for a fishing trip with two men on Lake Erie Wednesday afternoon .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A third person arrested in connection with the house fire in Derby which killed six children last month has been released on police bail. The 45-year-old man is the third person to be arrested following the deaths of Duwayne, Jade, John, Jack, Jessie and Jayden Philpott. The childrens' parents, Mick Philpott, 55, and his wife Mairead, 31, have been charged with their murder. Grief: Mick and Mairead Philpott cried at a news . conference about the fire, which killed six of their children . Service: The funerals will take at the family's local church, St Mary's, in Derby on June 22, followed by a burial at Nottingham Road cemetery in the Chaddesden area of the city . The couple are charged with murder following a blaze at their home in Victory Road in Allenton, Derby, on May 11. Jade, 10, and her brothers John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six, and Jayden, five, all died in the fire. Duwayne, 13, died in Birmingham Children's Hospital two days later. The latest arrest was revealed by Derbyshire Police two days before the funerals of the children, which will take place on Friday. Derbyshire Police confirmed the man arrested has since been released. A force spokeswoman said last night: 'He was questioned by officers and bailed this evening pending further inquiries.' Philpott, said to have fathered 17 children, and his wife are thought to have applied to authorities for compassionate leave to attend the children’s funerals. The funerals will take at the family’s . local church, St Mary’s, in Derby on June 22, followed by a burial at . Nottingham Road cemetery in the Chaddesden area of the city. With feelings running high in the area, police and the prison authorities would have had to assess whether the Philpotts would be safe attending the ceremony. Duwayne Philpott, 13, his sister Jade, 10, and brothers John, nine, Jack, seven, Jessie, six and Jayden, five, all died as a result of the blaze, which broke out in the early hours of May 11. Their parents were charged with murder 19 days later, are currently remanded in custody awaiting an appearance at Nottingham Crown Court on Monday. Family tragedy: Mick Philpott and his wife Mairead are charged with murdering six of their children . Their priest, Father Alan Burbidge, who will conduct the service, said Mr and Mrs Philpott  would not be present. He added: 'We have had confirmation this morning that the parents of the six children will not be attending the funeral which will take place at St Mary’s Catholic Church at 11am on June 22. 'The family have chosen that church as a venue because they are Catholic children and they wanted a full requiem mass in a Catholic church.' The couple originally wanted to hold the funeral at Derby Cathedral because of the . amount of people it was thought would want to attend. Earlier . this month a Prison Service spokesman explained to The People that a . full assessment would be undertaken involving police and other . agencies. 'It is a unique situation and we cannot think, right now, of . any other defendants in the past who have been charged with murdering . their children, then wanting to attend their funerals.That is why it . poses such a huge risk.' The spokesperson said that public protection was key and if the risk is too high a private memorial may be arranged. Respect: Well-wishers have left hundreds of cards, flowers, teddy bears and candles after a candlelit vigil . The People reported Mr Philpott's son . Richard, 25, told a friend: 'They want to be at the funerals and need . to be able to say goodbye. Whatever has happened, they are innocent . until proven guilty. The public should not judge them. Let a jury do . that when they know all the facts. Before their arrests, the Philpotts . had started planning the funerals and had arranged for six separate . double-horse-drawn hearses to carry the coffins at Derby Cathedral. The costs of the funeral service will . be met by DJ’s Trust - the D standing for Duwayne and the J for the five . other children - which was set up following the blaze. Organiser Anthony Slater said: 'We . have just over £14,000 in the fund at the moment which will pay for the . burial costs and the headstones. I have spoken to the family and they . still plan for the children to be brought to the service and taken to . the cemetery via horse-drawn hearses. Earlier this month Mairead Philpott wore a white sleeveless dress to court showing her tattoo that bears her dead children's names . 'In terms of money, I think we have hit what we need to hit to cover the funeral costs.' The news comes after the coroner’s office in Derby released the bodies from the mortuary at the Royal Derby Hospital on Tuesday. The six children were asleep upstairs when the fire broke out at the semi-detached house in Victory Road in the early hours of May 11. Derbyshire Police have confirmed that petrol was used to start the blaze. Smoke from the fire travelled upstairs to where the children were in bed. All six died as a result of smoke inhalation, the force has said. An inquest into their deaths was opened and adjourned at Derby Coroner’s Court last month by Coroner Dr Robert Hunter. The hearing was told that John, Jack, Jesse, Jayden and Jade were all certified dead at the accident and emergency department of the Royal Derby Hospital. Duwayne died of his injuries in Birmingham Children’s Hospital two days later. No causes of death were given during the inquest. Assistant Chief Constable Steve Cotterill is leading the murder investigation. He said: 'Our police investigations are ongoing and we are preparing a file for the Crown Prosecution Service.' The Prison Service has not confirmed if the Philpotts applied for leave, but said a risk assessment would be carried out as is standard practice if an application has been made. A spokeswoman said: 'We do not comment on the movements of individual prisoners. 'Prisoners can apply for escorted visits to attend the funeral of a close relative, but it will always be subject to a strict risk assessment where public protection is key.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","45-year-old man arrested yesterday has been bailed after questioning, Derbyshire Police confirm .

"By . Associated Press . A jury has awarded almost $14 million to a suburban Chicago woman who sued her doctor over a debilitating stroke she suffered after taking the popular birth control drug Yasmin. Lawyers for Mariola Zapalski, of Elmwood Park, say the stroke occurred 13 days after she began taking the drug, paralyzing her left side and causing permanent brain injury. According to ABC Local, the 37-year-old was prescribed the pill to deal with irregular bleeding in 2007. Incapacitated: Mariola Zapalski, 37, is helped in the bathroom by her husband Rafal.

Mariola Zapalski (left) is pushed by her lawyer Bradley Cosgrove alongside husband Rafal (right) after being awarded $14 million in a lawsuit against the drug Yasmin . Yasmin prevents ovulation and also cause changes in your cervical and uterine lining, making it harder for sperm to reach the uterus and harder for a fertilized egg to attach to the uterus. Last year the FDA changed the warning label on Yasmin and other estrogen containing birth control pills, warning of an increased risk for blood clots . She is now wheelchair-bound, paralyzed on her left side, unable to fully communicate and requires around-the-clock care. Her husband and her attorneys hope the verdict will serve as a victory not just for them, but for patients' rights everywhere. 'Nobody should have to go through what we did,' said Rafal Zapalski. Defendant Dr. Zbigniew Aniol declined to comment Saturday. Friday's verdict came after a two-week trial in Cook County Circuit Court. A $2.5 million settlement in the same matter was reached a month ago with Resurrection Medical Center - the hospital that referred Zapalski to the defendant.

"By . Associated Press . President Barack Obama conveyed skepticism Thursday about Russian promises to de-escalate a volatile situation in Ukraine, and said the United State and its allies are ready to impose fresh sanctions if Moscow doesn't make good on its commitments. 'My hope is we do see follow-through,' Obama said at an impromptu news conference at the White House a few hours after Secretary of State John Kerry wrapped up a meeting in Geneva with diplomats from Russia, Ukraine and the European Union. 'The question now becomes, will in fact they use the influence that they've exerted in a disruptive way to restore some order so that Ukrainians can carry out an election, move forward with the decentralization reforms that they've proposed, stabilize their economy and start getting back on the path of growth and democracy and that their sovereignty will be respected?' he said. Scroll down for video . Watching Russia: President Barack Obama voiced skepticism that Russia would carry out its new role in the Ukraine in a press conference on Thursday . Not over yet: Mr Obama said he's prepared to impose new sanctions if the Russians use their new-found influence in a 'disruptive way' Obama did not say what additional sanctions might be in the offing if commitments made by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Geneva do not materialize. U.S. officials have prepared penalties on wealthy Russians in President Vladimir Putin's inner circle, as well on the entities they run. The president and Vice President Joe Biden discussed the developments in a round of calls Thursday to foreign leaders. Obama called British Prime Minister David Cameron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose support for additional sanctions would be crucial given her country's close economic ties with Russia. The White House said in statements that the leaders agreed that they were prepared to enact further penalties on Russia if it does not de-escalate the situation 'in short order.' Biden conferred with leaders in the Eastern European region near Ukraine — Prime Minister Robert Fico of Slovakia and Bulgarian President Rosen Plevneliev — and discussed the need for Russia to take immediate action. Good talk: President Obama held the press conference in response to Secretary of State John Kerry's successful peace talks with Russian, Ukrainian and European Union diplomats in Geneva. Pictured above with EU High Representative Catherine Ashton . In his comments from the White House, Obama noted that Russia has thousands of troops massed along its border with eastern Ukraine, a deployment he called a measure of intimidation. He said the United States and others think Russia has played a hand in the 'disruption and chaos' that have recently spread through southern and eastern Ukraine. The agreement sketched out in Geneva would give amnesty to protesters who evacuate buildings they have occupied, except those found guilty of capital crimes. It says Kiev's plans to reform its constitution and transfer more power from the central government to regional authorities must be inclusive, transparent and accountable — including through the creation of a broad national dialogue. At the same time, the agreement gives Moscow a dayslong reprieve from threatened U.S. and European Union economic sanctions. The U.S. accuses Russia of stoking a potential eastern Ukraine separatist revolt against Kiev following Russia's annexation of Ukraine's strategic Crimean peninsula. Tensions between the U.S. and Russia escalated in recent weeks when Russian troops incurred on Crimea, a region in southeast Ukraine.

Obama said Ukraine had promised to respect the rights of residents of the southern and eastern part of the country, many of whom speak Russian or have other ties to their next-door neighboring country. As for Russia, Obama said, 'My hope is that we actually do see follow-through over the next several days, but I don't think, given past performance, that we can count on that, and we have to be prepared to potentially respond to what continue to be, you know, efforts of interference by the Russians in eastern and southern Ukraine.'","The President held an impromptu press conference after Secretary of State John Kerry wrapped up successful peace negotiations in Geneva .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A teacher has been arrested and suspended following allegations from pupils that he tickled and sniffed primary school children's feet. The staff member was held on suspicion of 'assault by touching', and four young boys have been quizzed over the allegations by officers. Parents said they were stunned when they heard police had been called to the school, in Blackburn, Lancashire, on Tuesday. Investigation: Darwen Council (pictured) is investigating claims a primary school teacher tickled and sniffed pupils' feet. Four boys have been quizzed about the alleged incidents . They were then contacted and told to come into school for a meeting, in which they were told their children had been ordered by the suspect to remove their shoes and socks in lessons. One parent said her son told her had been made to remove his footwear and sit on a desk. Children then had to play 'a game' in which they were told to go barefoot and chose a card. Children's feet were then either 'tickled or sniffed by the staff member' depending on which card they chose. The suspect has suspended and an investigation has been launched by Blackburn with Darwen Council. One mother said: 'I didn't know anything about this and was called into school to be told my son had been questioned by police. 'I am deeply concerned and I feel everyone should know what has been happening so it can be properly looked into. This is so confusing for children. 'My son said he was picked up and put on a table, his shoes and socks taken off. Then he had to pick a card saying tickle or sniff. How can under-tens make any sense of that?'

My daughter wasn't one of the kids questioned, but I am just as concerned as those parents are. The kids think it is all a game but I think it needs looking into.'

Welfare Reform Minister Lord Freud said: ‘As we continue with the rollout of Universal Credit, increasing numbers of people will need to know how it affects them and how to prepare. ‘Working with Looking Local, we have ensured as many tools as possible exist for people to find out everything they need to know about the easier-to-understand and more flexible benefit that is Universal Credit. ‘We are also making sure Universal Credit is an opportunity for people to build online skills, so they can look for work and benefit from what the online world offers for 21st century life.’ Welfare minister Lord Freud said technology would help more people to access details of Universal Credit . The TV information channels have had more than 30,000 hits since they were launched at the end of October, according to Looking Local, the organisation behind the service. Ministers hope the TV service will help get the information on Universal Credit to the estimated seven million British adults without an internet connection. Sky and Virgin customers with interactive TV can check if they are eligible for Universal Credit and how they can make a claim. Looking Local, which is owned by Kirklees Council, has also designed the only public sector service interface for a games console, which Wii users can now use to view the details. But the plan risks sparking controversy at a time when ministers are trying to take a tougher stance on benefits claims. In the Commons yesterday Tory MP Philip Davies said TV programmes such as ‘Benefits Street’ and ‘On Benefits & Proud’ reveal how some people living on the welfare state still manage to buy expensive gadgets and luxuries. Mr Davies said: ‘I have been struck by the number of people on them who manage to combine complaining about welfare reform with being able to afford to buy copious amounts of cigarettes, have lots of tattoos, and watch Sky TV on the obligatory widescreen television.’ He also raised ‘the concerns and irritation of many people who go to work every day and pay their taxes but cannot afford those kinds of luxuries’. The Universal Credit project has suffered a series of setbacks and Whitehall's spending watchdog has said the DWP failed to achieve ‘value for money’ in its development and needed to adopt ‘realistic expectations’ on the timetable for its delivery. The National Audit Office warning came after Mr Duncan Smith admitted that more than £40 million spent on IT for the project had been written off in 2012/13, with a further £91 million of software code expected to be written down in value to nil over the next five years. Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude was forced to deny reports of a rift with Mr Duncan Smith over the project, but said its initial implementation had been ‘pretty lamentable’.","Games consoles and 'red button' interactive TV service to give advice .

"By . Associated Press . and Ryan Gorman . The Florida man convicted in November of . second-degree murder for the 2007 slaying of Washington Redskins . star Sean Taylor has been sentenced to 57 years in prison. Eric Rivera Jr., 23, was sentenced Thursday after he was convicted in November of second-degree murder and armed burglary. Rivera had faced a maximum life sentence. Despite Florida having the death penalty, Rivera never faced it because he was only 17-years-old at the time of the killing - but he is required to serve 85 per cent of his sentence. Botched robbery: Eric Rivera Jr, shown last year during his trial, was sentenced to 57 years in prison for  the slaying of Redskins star Sean Taylor . Locked up: Rivera sat quietly at the defense table with his lawyers last year as the verdict was announced, showing no reaction or emotion . The 57 year sentence handed down Monday allows Rivera to avoid life in prison, but he will not be eligible for parole until he is 72-years-old. Rivera told police in a videotaped . confession that he and other young men from the Fort Myers area broke . into Taylor's Miami-area house hoping to steal cash the NFL player kept . there. Taylor surprised them because he was home instead of on a road trip with the Redskins, and was shot after confronting them with a machete. Rivera admitted shooting the star player, but said on the witness stand during his trial that his confession was given . only under police pressure and amid purported threats to his family. The sentence comes two months after he sat quietly at the defense table . with his lawyers after the verdict was announced, showing no reaction or . emotion. The courtroom was packed with Taylor and Rivera family . members, but there were no outbursts when the verdict was read. Neither prosecutors, Taylor's family nor the family of the football player's girlfriend would comment after the hearing. In the confession, Rivera said the group . of five young men, all from the Fort Myers area, had driven to Taylor's . house planning to steal large amounts of cash he kept inside. Victim: Taylor is shown during the team's 2007 preseason summer training camp . They . thought Taylor, 24, would be out of town at a game against Tampa Bay, . but didn't realize until it was too late that he was home with a knee . injury. Taylor's then-girlfriend, Jackie Garcia Haley, and their . 18-month-old daughter, were also home at the time. They were not hurt. Four other men were also charged in the . case and three will be tried later. Venjah Hunte, 25, pleaded guilty to . second-degree murder and burglary charges in a deal that calls for a . 29-year prison sentence. Rivera . claimed while testifying in his own defense that it was Hunte who brought the 9mm handgun and shot Taylor. Rivera insisted that he was not told about the burglary plot until the . group was driving across Alligator Alley toward Miami, and that he . stayed in the car outside Taylor's house the whole time. The murder weapon was never found. Police say it was stuffed in a sock and thrown into the Everglades. Taylor, a Pro Bowl safety who had . starred at the University of Miami, was shot in the upper thigh, . damaging his femoral artery and causing massive blood loss. Admission: Rivera, shown last October during his trial, was 17-years-old at the time of the killing - sparing him from the death penalty . Witnesses . say Taylor was shot when he confronted the group with a machete outside . his bedroom. A medical examiner said he was essentially dead on arrival . at a hospital on November 26, 2007, although doctors did manage to restart . his heart for a while. Aside from Rivera's confession, police . found shoe prints outside Taylor's home that matched sneakers some in . the group were wearing that night. Witnesses testified Rivera was seen . driving a rented black Toyota Highlander believed used in the crime, and . another witness said the group of five had burglary tools when they . came to her house after Taylor was shot. An American hero: Prosecutors described Taylor during the trial as an American hero who was sleeping with his girlfriend and their baby when the armed thugs busted into his home and killed him . Taylor, a first-round Redskins draft . pick in 2004, signed an $18 million contract with the team and was . becoming one of the NFL's top defensive players when he was slain. Several witnesses, including Garcia Haley, testified that he liked to . keep large amounts of cash around his Miami house. One of the men charged in the slaying, . 25-year-old Jason Mitchell, attended a birthday party a few weeks . earlier at the house for Taylor's half-sister, Sasha Johnson â€” who lived . in Fort Myers and knew Rivera. She testified that Taylor gave her a . purse containing $10,000 in cash at the party, which was witnessed by . all the guests. That event put the wheels in motion for . the burglary plot, witnesses said. Rivera himself testified that some in . the group thought they would get between $100,000 and $200,000 to split . up. Also charged and awaiting trial are Mitchell, Charles Wardlow, 24, and 22-year-old Timothy Brown. Jackie . Garcia, Taylor's girlfriend, who was also inside the bedroom, became . noticeably upset as the detective recounted details of the slaying and . rested her head on her knees in court. She sat near several members of . Taylor's family, including his father, Florida City Police Chief Pedro . Taylor, in the packed Miami-Dade County courtroom.

"By . Mia De Graaf . A man who spent ten years with his mother's mummified corpse sat at his kitchen table has been found dead next to her. Claudio Alferi, 58, was discovered lying over a chair in his Buenos Aires apartment beside a 'dried out' woman wrapped in plastic bags and wearing slippers. Police and firefighters burst into the property on Wednesday after neighbours complained of a bad smell lasting since mid-December. Discovery: Police and firefighters burst into this flat in Carapachay, Buenos Aires, after neighbours reported a smell that had last for three weeks. They found Claudio Alferi, 58, dead next to his mother's corpse . Mystery: Residents in the Argentine capital told officers Mr Alferi had assured them his mother, Margarita Aimer de Alferi, was alive and well. But forensic experts say she died eight to ten years ago . But the officers were forced to call for instant back up on discovering two corpses. Forensic experts and neighbours identified the woman as Mr Alferi's mother, Margarita Aimer de Alferi . Residents in Carapachay, on the outskirts of the Argentine capital, told detectives they last saw Ms Alferi a decade ago when she was 90 - but her son had insisted she was alive and well. Initial investigations suggest the couple both died from natural causes. Forensic experts called to the rundown property on Wednesday believe Ms Alferi died between eight and 10 years ago. Mr Alferi, they claim, has been dead for 30 days. Police told local media Mr Alferi is believed to have suffered a psychological breakdown after his mother's death, and also suffered from obsessive compulsive disorder. An autopsy will be carried out next week as officers probe claims Mr Alferi, believed to have died 30 days ago, suffered a mental breakdown and hid his mother's death due to problems with inheritance . They are now probing allegations he hid his mother's corpse because of a problem over inheritance. A police source said: 'The old lady's body was covered in bags and plastic and she still had her winter slippers on. 'It looked like she had been covered up lovingly.' A neighbour added: 'Claudio was a recluse and rarely spoke to us. 'Whenever anyone asked about his mum he'd just say: ""She's fine.""' An autopsy on both bodies will be carried out next week.","Claudio Alferi, 58, found across a chair in Buenos Aires kitchen next to a 'dried out' woman sat upright in plastic bags and a pair of slippers .

"The father of a missing boy whose body was found off a Massachusetts highway says he was crushed to hear that his 5-year-old son's remains had been identified but is planning his funeral. Jose Oliver tells the Boston Herald he was 'lost, angry and crushed' when the medical examiner called to confirm the body found Friday was his son's. 'I wasn’t hoping to find him like that — wrapped in a blanket in a suitcase on the side of a highway like he was an animal or something,' Jose Oliver told the Boston Herald. Jeremiah Oliver was last seen in September but wasn't reported missing until December. Found dead: A body recovered near a wooded area in Massachusetts on Friday morning has been confirmed to be missing five-year-old Fitchburg boy Jeremiah Oliver. Tests: Massachusetts State Police stand along Interstate 190 where police said a child's body was found near Sterling . The little boy's body was found off a highway in central Massachusetts on Friday morning and it appeared that the child had been murdered. The body had been wrapped in blanket-like material, and packed into a suitcase. Before his body was found, Jeremiah's . case led to criminal charges against his mother and her boyfriend. There were also calls for changes within the state's child welfare agency. Three workers . were fired as a result. No new charges have been announced related to Jeremiah's death. Jose Oliver lives in New Britain, Connecticut and says he plans to return Sunday to Massachusetts. As word that Jeremiah had been identified spread, on Saturday people came to the Fitchburg street where he had lived, and about 100 people attended a vigil there last night. 'He was a little charmer,' said Sarah Wadkins, who said she had stayed at a family shelter at the same time as Jeremiah and his mother, Elsa Oliver. 'If he wanted something, he would turn around and smile and make your day. The world would brighten up.' The main suspects: Elsa Oliver (left), 28, and Alberto Sierra (right), 22, have been charged with multiple counts related to the young boy's disappearance . Jeremiah was last seen by relatives in September but wasn't reported missing until December. Authorities have said they feared he was dead. The family was being monitored by state social workers at the time, and the case led to scrutiny of the state Department of Children and families. Jeremiah's mother, Elsa Oliver, pleaded not guilty in March to charges including kidnapping, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, and reckless endangerment. Her boyfriend pleaded not guilty to similar charges. They have been held since December on lesser charges in the case. The heartbreaking tale has been months in the making, as Jeremiah was reported missing in December when his sister told someone at her school that she and her siblings were being abused. Unusual behavior: Elsa Oliver, seen here in December, began acting strangely and refused to speak to even her own lawyer . Emotionless: Elsa Oliver reportedly spoke to a relative recently and randomly interjected asking 'Is it the Rapture?' The girl said that the last time they saw Jeremiah- which is said to be on September 14- his hand was bleeding and for unexplained reasons, his mother Elsa was reportedly worried that he would die as a result of the hand wound. Elsa Oliver and her boyfriend Alberto Sierra, 22, were first brought into court in December. Both Elsa Oliver and Alberto Sierra face multiple charges, including assault with a dangerous weapon (a belt), two counts of reckless endangerment of a child and two counts of being an accessory after the fact of a felony and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. During the initial investigation a strange clue was offered when it was found that Elsa had a tattoo with a butterfly and the date 'Sept. 25, 2013' written below it. Police have spoken to local tattoo artists because they want to know whether she told a tattoo artist why that date is significant. Missing: The search had been going on since December although young Jeremiah Oliver has not been seen since September . It is not clear why it took three months for authorities to be notified of Jeremiah's disappearance, but an anonymous tip led them to believe that the mother's boyfriend may have had something to do with the alleged abuse. The source said Sierra, 22, would bully and intimidate those around him, routinely becoming irate and even making death threats on more than one occasion. Both Elsa Oliver and Alberto Sierra face multiple charges, including assault with a dangerous weapon (a belt), two counts of reckless endangerment of a child and two counts of being an accessory after the fact of a felony and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. Jose Oliver said he plans to attend both trials to learn every detail of what led to his son’s death. 'There has to be a reason,' Mr Oliver said. 'I want to know everything that happened. You just don’t kill a 5-year-old.'","Jeremiah Olicer was last seen on September 14 but authorities weren't notified until December when his sister complained of being abused .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Divers in Australia have captured rare images of the Pyrostremma spinosum, or pyrosome, sea creature off the coast of Tasmania. It is so rare it has been dubbed the 'Unicorn of the Sea' and can grow up to 30 metres long - the equivalent of two double-decker buses laid end-to-end. Its hollow, translucent, cylindrical body is made up of thousands of tiny clones called zooids that pull water through its tubes and feed on plankton before pushing the filtered water back out. Divers from the Eaglehawk Dive Centre in Australia, including Michael Baron, have captured rare images of the Pyrostremma spinosum sea creature, pictured, that can reach 30 metres in length. Its translucent cylindrical body is made up of thousands of tiny filter-feeding creatures called zooids . The zooids are each connected by tissue and move as one inside the pyrosome's tube structure and each zooid is a few millimetres in size. Also called a sea squirt, the pyrosomes are classed as pelagic, which means they are free-swimming and live in open water rather than near land. This means they are rarely spotted and only diving groups are likely to catch a glimpse of the giant creatures. The long tube consists of a pointed end with a hole on the other that can be as wide as two metres. Each pyrosome feasts on . plankton and according to Rebecca Helm from Deep Sea News, it is a cross between the Borg in . ‘Star Trek’ and a clone in ‘Star Wars.’ Helm said: 'They’re giant, terrifying looking, and trolling through the depths of the ocean, waiting for you to swim in one end and get stuck.  Maybe. But fortunately, in addition to being slow moving filter feeders, they’re also delicate and fluffy.' The pyrosome is so delicate one diver is said to have even described it like a feather boa. The zooids, pictured, are each connected by tissue and move as one inside the pyrosome's tube structure. They pull water through the hole at the end of the pyrosome and feed on plankton before pushing the filtered water back out . Pyrosomes usually live in the upper layers of the open ocean in warm seas, although some are found a bit deeper. Pyrosomes are cylindrical-shaped colonies made up of  thousands of individuals, known as zooids. Colonies can be less than one centimetre up to several metres in length. Each zooid is a few millimetres in size and are each connected by tissue and move as one inside the pyrosome's tube structure. Pyrosomes are classed as planktonic. This means their movements are mainly controlled by currents, tides and waves in the oceans. Michael Baron from from Eaglehawk Dive Centre recorded the footage of the giant creature off the Tasman Peninsula in Tasmania, Australia. He said it was one of the few areas in the world where a wide range of 'oceanic gelatinous plankton' comes close to shore. Baron also managed to film salps that are similar to pyrosomes but the individuals inside it are much larger than the zooids inside the pyrosome. According to Eaglehawk Dive Centre's YouTube page: 'Salps have much larger individuals than . pyrosomes, individuals pump water through themselves. 'Colonies are . formed of chains of individuals. Salps can form very high densities . under good conditions, and are an important oceanic food source for . fish.

She didn't need to pack an overnight bag though as she was released at approximately 1:30am and headed back to her rented home having spent almost as much time out eating sushi earlier in the evening as she spent behind bars. Her early release is thought to be due to overcrowding in prison.

"By . Alexandra Klausner . Prison officials are searching for a 49-year-old escaped inmate who fled the Oak Glen Camp in San Bernadino County. James Murray, an inmate firefighter, was last observed on Friday night in his dorm room in Yuicaipa, reports NBC. Murray is white, has short brown hair, and stands 5 feet 9 inches tall. James Murray, 49, escaped from Oak Glen Camp in San Bernadino County yesterday and authorities are still attempting to capture him . Murray was imprisoned for second-degree burglary and has been in prison since Oct 25, 2012, said the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. The Mail Online spoke with Sgt. F. Martinez who said that they have not yet captured Murray but have been adamantly searching for him. They had a dog team scout for Murray's scent which they followed to a nearby highway leading them to believe that Murray may have entered a vehicle and drove off. They also had a helicopter circle the area to look for additional clues. Martinez said that as of 12:45 today they suspended the foot search for Murray and will work with undercover agents who monitor phone calls or any possible contact with friends or family members. Inmate firefighters like Murray fight wild land fire along with non incarcerated firefighters as part of Oak Glen's fire crews and program aimed at lowering prison recidivism rates. Each crew consists of 16 inmates and one inmate fire captain. Once inmates are legally released back into society many go on to continue the profession they have been trained in while they were prisoners. Authorities are asking anyone with information to call the Oak Glen Conservation Camp Commander at (909) 797-0196.

"By . Julian Robinson . Dictator Robert Mugabe has laid into Britain describing it as 'small in mind' and a nation that had 'gone to the dogs'. The Zimbabwe President said people with 'gay habits' in Britain should be ashamed adding that he felt 'pity' for the Queen, who he admires. In a rare interview, the 90-year-old tyrant hit out at the Labour 'ruffians' of 1997 and branded then Prime Minister Tony Blair and US President George W Bush 'liars' over their dealings with his homeland. Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe delivers a speech during celebrations to mark his 90th birthday in Marondera, east of  Harare, in February. He has lashed out at Britain saying it had 'gone to the dogs' He said: 'That wisdom which the likes of Churchill had, where is it? 'You can’t see it in people now with gay habits – shame on them. I pity the one lady I admire, the Queen, that she is in these circumstances, I’m sure down deep she must be groaning (at) the loss of values in Britain. 'They’ve gone to the dogs.' He went on to say that 'countries don't respect Britain any more' and that Prime Minister David Cameron 'doesn't talk much, but he acts in the same was as (George W) Bush'. The extraordinary outburst also involved an attack on current US President Barack Obama who he claimed had abandoned the black population in the US. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair, pictured left, who, along with former US President George W. Bush, right, has been described as a 'liar' by Zimbabwe dictator Robert Mugabe . Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe celebrated his 90th birthday earlier this year by telling Britain: 'We don't hate you, we only love our country better' The interview, due to air tonight at 9.30pm on the BBC News Channel, came just weeks after the dictator marked his 90th birthday by telling Britain: 'We don't hate you, we only love our country better'. As part of the £600,000 celebrations, he released 90 red balloons at a football stadium in the small farming town of Marondera in Zimbabwe. His aides have denied reports that he is suffering from advanced prostate cancer. But speculation about Mugabe’s health has fuelled a succession struggle in the country that he has ruled since 1980. In recent months the country has seen allegations of massive corruption in state enterprises at a time when many Zimbabweans are surviving on less than £1.20 a day.","Robert Mugabe says Britain's values have 'gone to the dogs' in rare interview .

Jon Reiter of California is currently on his second attempt to summit the world's tallest mountain and was moving up to Camp 1 Friday morning when he heard a 'crack' sound and saw snow and ice come barreling down the mountain. The 49-year-old says his first thought was to get his camera out and film the avalanche, but his quick-thinking Sherpa instead pushed him to safety behind some ice blocks. Life-saver: Jon Reiter of California poses with his Sherpa guide Dawa the day after a deadly avalanche swept the mountain . Deadly force: The avalanche that killed at least thirteen sherpas is pictured as it barrels down Mount Everest . No hope of survival: Rescuers on Mount Everest found the body of a 13th Nepalese guide buried under snow as authorities ruled out hope of finding any more survivors from the deadliest accident ever on the world's highest peak . In a blog post written Saturday, Reiter praises his Sherpa named Dawa, calling him an amazing man whom he has great respect for. 'He's a perfect example of the selfless Sherpa people that we entrust with out lives while on the mountain and who we quickly learn to call of friends [sic]' In the post, he included a picture of Dawa just as the guide was leaving base camp Saturday. 'Dawa is the man who was by my side with the avalanche struck. He's the guy who spent all day yesterday digging his friends and neighbors out of the snow and sending their limp bodies hanging on a cable from the helicopter down to base camp. 'After a long 16 agonizing hours he showed up at my tent, before going to his own, to make sure I was ok,' Reiter wrote. Aftermath: Reiter (right) poses with Marcus Brindle of Melbourne, Australia and Mingma Sherpa (center) on Easter Sunday - two days after the deadly avalanche . Should he stay or go? As of Saturday, Reiter seemed unsure whether he would continue with his attempt to summit Everest . Narrow escape: A Photo of fellow climbers taken by Jon Reiter at the Kumbu Icefall on Mt. Everest a few days before Friday's deadly avalanche . So far 13 bodies have been pulled from the mountain and an additional three people are still missing. All of the dead were Sherpas, native Himalyans who guide foreign climbers up the mountain. Reiter says the tragedy has shaken the Sherpa community on the mountain and that most of them have decided to go home and be with their families for a few days. 'This scene is a lot for us western climbers to take in so I can't imagine what our Sherpa partners are really feeling and thinking as we all witness the worst disaster in Everest history happening in front of our eyes,' he wrote. Reiter also addressed the theories that over-crowing or litter on the mountain caused the devastating avalanche in the area of Everest known as the 'popcorn field'. Reiter maintains that the avalanche was an accident and an act of nature. Mother of Nepalese mountaineer Ang Kaji Sherpa, killed in an avalanche on Mount Everest, cries while she waits for his body at Sherpa Monastery in Katmandu, Nepal, Saturday, April 19, 2014. Rescuers were searching through piles of snow and ice on the slopes of Mount Everest on Saturday for four Sherpa guides who were buried by an avalanche that killed 12 other Nepalese guides in the deadliest disaster on the world's highest peak. The Sherpa people are one of the main ethnic groups in Nepal's alpine region, and many make their living as climbing guides on Everest and other Himalayan peaks.

The daughter of Mount Everest avalanche victim Ang Kazi Sherpa cries while consoled by a relative as the body is brought to the Sherpa Monastery . 'There were only about 40 of us in the entire icefall and we were spread out,' he writes. 'There was no one waiting for others in order to move up and no congestion anywhere in the icefall. It appeared to be perfect climbing conditions right up until the moment the thunder struck.' And while littering has been a problem on the mountain in the past, Reiter says it couldn't possibly have played a role in Friday's tragedy. 'Excessive trash did not cause this to happen. There is absolutely no garbage that I saw anywhere in the icefall. Actually we should all be proud of how good this place really looks. This was a random act of nature.' Climbers declared a four-day halt to efforts to scale the 8,848-metre (29,029-ft) summit and, while some decided to abandon their mission, others said they would go ahead after talking to their guides. Dangerous: A group of more than a dozen sherpas had gone up on the mountain early Friday morning to fix some ropes that would be used by trekkers later in the day, but one survivor recalled feeling that the route was unstable . Relatives of a Mount Everest avalanche victim grieve as bodies arrive at the Sherpa Monastery in Kathmandu . Relative await news: Seven climbers were rescued, including two airlifted to Kathmandu for treatment. The avalanche hit at a site known as the Khumbu icefall at more than 5,000 m altitude, as the climbers were ascending from the base camp to camp one . As of Saturday, Reiter seemed unsure . of whether he would continue his summit attempt on Everest - fulfilling . his goal of climbing the tallest mountain on every continent. 'Early . this morning I read a comment written about me where the author said, . ""I hope he finds what he's looking for up there."" I appreciated that . notion because it got me to thinking about what am I looking for, and I . think I have found it whether I see the summit of Everest or not,' Reiter wrote. But Reiter may not have a choice in the matter. His wife Susan Reiter told MailOnline Sunday that the Sherpas are threatening to take down the ladders and ropes up to the summit if the Nepalese government doesn't reward the family's victims benefits. The Sherpas have set a deadline for Tuesday, so that's when Reiter will know if he can attempt a summit or not. If he doesn't make it this year, Mrs Reiter says he's likely to go back and try in 2015. 'I think he will. I mean, he says he won't but that's what he said last year when he had to turn around,' she told MailOnline. When the Nepalese government released this list, only 12 were dead and four were missing. The latest reports have the number of fatalities up to 13 but they have not disclosed who is the new fatality. Name of expedition . NBC Everest Expedition . Adventurist Everest Expedition .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated Press Reporter . 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' director Bryan Singer will not be making any public appearances despite being one of the headlining names of the next installment of the big budget action series. Singer has decided against appearing at a Saturday fan convention in Anaheim and will not make any other appearances as his legal situation plays out in the court system. He has been accused of sexually abusing multiple underage boys at drug-fueled parties, but insists he is innocent. A source confirmed to Buzzfeed that producer-screenwriter Simon Kinberg will be stepping in for Singer at Saturday's Wondercon fan convention, and that all other public appearances will also be reexamined. Accused: A man who claims he was sexually abused by the X-Men franchise director Bryan Singer said Thursday, April 17, 2014, that he reported the molestation to authorities at the time, and does not know why charges were never pursued . The move comes as Singer moved to defend himself after a press conference Friday where a lawyer for one of his accusers claimed more suits alleging misconduct are on the way. He made it to ensure his personal problems would not overshadow the movie itself, a source told the site. Credit card receipts, telephone . records and production schedules show that X-Men franchise director . Bryan Singer was not in Hawaii when a lawsuit claims he sexually abused a . 17-year-old on the islands, a defense attorney said Friday. Singer . was mainly in Toronto working on the first X-Men movie from August . through October 1999, defense attorney Marty Singer told The Associated . Press. A lawsuit filed by a . former child model, Michael Egan III, says Bryan Singer abused him . several times over those three months as well as earlier in California . as part of a Hollywood sex ring led by another man convicted of luring . minors across state lines for sex. 'This was Bryan's first studio film,' Marty Singer said. 'Clearly, he's not going to take a break in the middle of this movie while you're shooting and prepping it to go to Hawaii.' Egan's lawyer, Jeff Herman, did not immediately respond to phone calls seeking comment. Egan said Thursday that he was abused by Bryan Singer and others starting when he was 15. He said he was given drugs and promises of a Hollywood career while being threatened and sexually abused in Los Angeles and Hawaii. The AP does not typically name victims of sex abuse but is naming Egan because he is speaking publicly about his allegations. Marty Singer, who said previously that he and the director are not related, declined to provide any of the personal records, saying they were private. Sordid details: A sex abuse lawsuit by Michael Egan, a former child model and aspiring actor is accusing X-Men franchise director Bryan Singer of sexually abusing him as a teenager in a federal lawsuit filed in Hawaii . He said the filming records were . available publicly but 20th Century Fox did not immediately return a . phone call and email seeking comment. X-Men . was released in July 2000. Singer has directed three films in the . blockbuster franchise, including the fifth installment, X-Men: Days of . Future Past, to be released next month, as well as other films . including The Usual Suspects. His . lawyer said the director was never interviewed by any authorities about . the claims by Egan, who said Thursday he reported the Los Angeles acts . and doesn't know why charges were not pursued. The . lawsuit was filed under a Hawaii law that temporarily suspends the . statute of limitations in sex abuse cases. The law has led to several . lawsuits against clergy members and others. A judge in Hawaii set a July 21 scheduling hearing in Honolulu for the lawsuit, which was filed Wednesday.","Singer has announced he will not attend a fan convention or any other previously scheduled events .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . Animal welfare activists protested outside Liam Neeson's New York home on Saturday after the actor came out in support of Central Park's carriage horses. About 50 protesters gathered on the street outside his Upper West Side apartment, but Neeson did not make an appearance. Police watched, and doormen photographed protesters hoisting signs with such slogans as 'Liam Neeson: Stop Supporting Cruelty!' and 'Worked to Death!' with an image of a dead horse in a park. Protest: About 50 animal rights activists gathered outside the Manhattan home of Liam Neeson on Saturday . Holding the second sign was Peter Wood, . an animal protection investigator for various organizations that say . it's cruel for the horses to be subjected to traffic, pollution and . possible accidents. 'It's 2014, not 1914. It's time for a change,' Wood, who lives in Manhattan, said. Support: Liam Neeson has said carriage horses should stay in the city . 'Horses don't belong in traffic, surrounded by buses. They don't belong in the city; it's outdated, it's cruel,""' he said, adding: 'Life attached to a carriage with a poop bag attached to your rear end - that's no life.' Neeson, whose movies include Schindler's List, 'Taken and Non-Stop, is a vocal supporter of the city's carriage horses, which are kept in stables he toured recently with lawmakers. He says the horses are not being mistreated. 'It has been my experience, always, that horses, much like humans, are at their happiest and healthiest when working,' Neeson wrote in an April 14 editorial in The New York Times. He called the horse carriage trade a 'humane industry that is well regulated by New York City's Departments of Health and Mental Hygiene and Consumer Affairs'. Neeson said the city's horse-drawn carriages have made an estimated 6 million trips in traffic in the past 30 years, most ending up in Central Park. Four horses have been killed in collisions with motor vehicles, with no human fatalities. 'In contrast to the terrible toll of traffic accidents generally on New Yorkers,' Neeson wrote, 'the carriage industry has a remarkable safety record.' His publicist declined to comment on Saturday's protest. The City Council must vote on the issue, but legislation has yet to emerge. Mayor Bill de Blasio has pledged to ban the carriages and replace them with electric vintage-style cars, commissioned by a group called NYCLASS. Gathering: Protesters waited outside Neeson's Manhattan home on Saturday after the actor said he did not back the proposed ban . Horseless carriage: The electric car, designed to look like a classic motor, is being offered as an alternative . Controversial: Mayor Bill de Blasio's campaign to end horse-drawn carriage rides has met criticism . On Saturday, NYCLASS members joined protesters from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. They noted that the horse-drawn carriage trade was ended in at least three other cities: London in 1947, Paris in 1965 and Toronto in 1998. A prototype of the electric vehicle was revealed several days ago at the New York International Auto Show. But Neeson said it can't replace the horse-drawn carriages, which he calls a 'signature element of New York's culture and history'.","Star publicly opposed city mayor's plan to end tourist attraction .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An Oklahoma man faces multiple rape charges over a game of truth or dare he allegedly played with two underage girls that turned sexual on more than one occasion. Authorities in Moore say 20-year-old Danny Hilton would 'dare' the two girls - ages 14 and 15 - to perform sex acts on both him and on each other. One of the girls eventually told her mother. Court documents obtained by news9.com show that one of the incidents occurred in February in Hilton's bedroom at his parents' home. The girls later told authorities that Hilton encouraged them to accept various 'dares' that were sexual in nature. Dare: Authorities say Danny Hilton would 'dare' the two girls to perform sex acts on him and on each other . When police interviewed the two girls, they were told about at least three other incidents involving the 15-year-old dating back to August of 2013. The 15-year-old told police that she successfully fought off one of Hilton's alleged sexual attacks. Hilton's father claims the incidents happened in his son's bedroom when he was either sleeping or not at home. When Hilton's father confronted him about the allegations, he denied them. The elder Hilton then kicked his son out of his house. Truth: Hilton admitted to authorities that he played the game with the two girls, and to having sexual contact with them . In a subsequent interview with police, Hilton admitted to playing the game with the two girls, and to the sex acts, according to court documents. Despite admitting to the alleged crime, people have taken to social media to support - or defend - the alleged sexual predator. In one Facebook post, Ramona Ager - an Oklahoma woman who identifies herself on social media as being an employee of a company called Raising the Standard Ministries - questions whether the two girls are actually victims. Scene: The alleged incident happened in Hilton's bedroom at his father's home. His father later kicked him out after learning about the allegations against him . 'I'm not saying that he shouldn't be held accountable but this BOY is just barely out of HIS teens himself! and I don't think these girls are as ""innocent"" as they are portraying to be,' she posted on a local news website 'I think they are making him the scapegoat and ""playing the victim"".... if I truly felt like I was violated, I certainly would NOT go back even ONE time much less ""several times"".... now this young man is labeled FOR LIFE as a sex offender...... smh.' Hilton currently is in the Cleveland County Jail on three counts of second-degree rape and two counts of forcible sodomy.","Danny Hilton allegedly would dare the two girls - ages 14 and 15 - to perform sexual acts on him .

"By . Ashley Collman . While many like their Corona with lime, a man in Lincoln, Nebraska was pictured with a more unusual beer pairing at a monster truck rally last week. A user posted a picture to Reddit showing a man at Monster Jam drinking a dark liquid out of a bottle before cracking open a can of Miller Lite. ''Murica! Monster Jam is worth the admission just for the people you get to see! Yes, that's a syrup bottle,' the user named Travis wrote. Sipping on...beer and syrup? The man pictured in an orange cutoff t-shirt above was drinking a Miller Lite and syrup out of the bottle at a monster truck rally in Lincoln, Nebraska last week . Low blood sugar: Someone sitting near the man reported him telling cops that he was drinking the syrup because of his diabetes . Put it away: The cop was fine with the syrup after figuring out there was no hard alcohol involved. But an event person told him no outside food or beverage was permitted and that his bottle would be taken away if he continued to drink it . The next image shows a police officer approaching the man in an orange cutoff shirt about the dark liquid. 'The cop asked why he had it, and his response was that he was diabetic and his blood sugar was low,' Travis told SB Nation. That was a good enough reason for the cop, who left him alone, but not for the event organizers . 'The cop said ok and walked away, about 5 minutes after a woman who worked for the arena came and told the dude they didn't allow outside food or beverage and that if she saw him drink it again she would have it taken away .

Following SB Nation's story posted on Friday, a man claiming to be the syrup-drinker emerged on Twitter calling Travis out. He maintains that he didn't cry, and if he did it didn't have anything to do with the syrup scandal. 'I Did Not Cry.

"By . Jennifer Newton . DNA tests are being carried out on bones thought to belong to kings and queens from 1,000 years ago, including King Canute. Experts at Winchester Cathedral are studying the contents of mortuary chests full of bones, which are expected to include those of former Anglo-Saxon and Norman monarchs. The conservation work at the cathedral had focused on the chests themselves rather than the bones inside them. DNA analysis is taking place on bones thought to belong to ancient kings and queens at Winchester Cathedral, pictured . But an official cathedral tour guide is thought to let slip to visitors that focus was shifting to analysing the bones. She told a group of tourists: 'What's happening here is very exciting. 'We've begun work here to look at the DNA of some of our oldest kings.' The last ancient royal bones to be found were those of Richard III, pictured here in a facial reconstruction . Rumours are now circulating that a confidential deal has been signed with a television company to produce a documentary about the work. However, this was denied by Winchester Cathedral, which attracts 300,000 visitors a year. King Cynegils, who ruled from 611 to 643 as well as King Cenwalh, King Egbert and King Ethelwulf are all thought to be interred in the caskets. The bones of King Eadred, King Eadwig, King Canute and his wife Queen Emma of Normandy could also be inside. If they do belong to ancient kings and queens, they will be the first ancient bones to be discovered since those of Richard III, which were uncovered under a car park in Leicester in 2012. The work to identify the bones will also be a difficult task as those inside the Cathedral chests are not in order. In 1642 during the English Civil War, Roundhead troops stormed the cathedral, with the large bones used to smash the building's precious stained glass windows. When they were gathered up and returned to the chests in 1661, it was not known which bones went together, meaning some might have been mixed up. They remained in place for 350 years until two years ago when they were moved from the cathedral's quire by the altar to the Lady Chapel in the east of the building. This is now closed off to visitors as the chests - six in total - are lined up under strong lighting behind a screen while the DNA work is ongoing. In addition, the bones of Norman monarch King Rufus, who was felled by arrow on August 2, 1100 in the New Forest, are expected to be interred at the cathedral. Winchester Cathedral, which attracts 300,000 visitors a year has six mortuary chests of bones that are being studied .","Bones at Winchester Cathedral are thought to belong to ancient monarchs .

"By . Darren Boyle . Iran has slashed its nuclear stockpile by almost 75 percent the International Atomic Energy Committee has confirmed. The IAEA has spent the past six months investigating whether the Tehran regime has complied with its international obligations. In a report to the United Nations, the IAEA has confirmed that Iran halted aspects of its nuclear programme on January 20 opening the possibility of the easing of international sanctions. New Iranian President Hassan Rouhani (pictured) is seen as far more moderate than his predecessor . As a result of Iran's compliance with the international agreement it is now possible for Tehran to access foreign currency reserves frozen since the dispute arose. The IAEA confirmed that Iran has diluted half of its higher-grade enriched uranium reserve to a level that cannot be used to make a nuclear bomb. It is understood that over the past three months Iran has diluted 155kg of its higher-grade uranium gas - less than the 250kg necessary to build a bomb. As a result of Iran's compliance the United States' government has began moves to release $450 million of Iranian funds frozen since the crisis began. Western governments feared that former Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (pictured) wanted his country to develop nuclear weapons. Here, Ahmadinejad is visiting the Natanz Uranium Enrichment facility in April 2008 . State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said 'all sides have kept committments made' as a result of the agreement. Western diplomatic sources said that the election of Hassan Rouhani as Iranian president has enabled progress following years of strife while Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was in charge. Experts said that development means Iran has substantially less 20 percent enriched uranium that is required to build a nuclear warhead. Last year, Iran had almost 200kg of this material which was approaching the 250kg necessary to build a bomb. Western governments had feared that Iran wanted to develop its own nuclear deterrent bringing further instability to the Middle East .","Iran has reduced the amount of bomb-making uranium in its stockpile .

Special delivery: Waldo was welcomed into the world via C-section two weeks after Danielle Dwyer's original due date, giving him extra time to beef up . The quirky couple explained that they loved the 'Where’s Waldo?' books as children, so that’s where they got their son’s unusual first name. Dwyer said . the middle name Mysterious is because Waldo was born under a blood red . lunar eclipse on April 14, 2014 — a date that reads the same forward and . backward. Illusive namesake: The couple were inspired to give their son the name Waldo because they both loved the 'Where's Waldo?' books as children . ‘If there is one child who could own that name Waldo James Mysterious, I think that it's him,’ Brian told the station WPVI. The Dwyers live in the Fishtown section of Philadelphia. New dad Brian is a co-owner of Pizza Brain, a popular pizza shop and likely the world's first ever pizza museum. Danielle Dwyer, originally from California, works at The Random Team Room & Curiosity Shop. The couple's hefty bundle of joy was delivered via C-section two weeks after Danielle Dwyer's original due date, reported the Delaware County Daily Times. The parents had been expecting a baby weighing 9-10lbs, but as his mother put it, Waldo had a little extra time to 'cook.' ‘When . he came out, when the doctor pulled him out, on his shoulders, there . were so many fat rolls you couldn't tell where his armpits were,’ said .

"By . Peter Rugg . A Texas judge has ruled that an inmate with the critical thinking ability of a first-grader is responsible for spending the last 34 years incarcerated on an overturned murder conviction because he never asked for a new trial. Jerry Hartfield, 56, has been behind bars without a new trial since 1980. But in a recent ruling, Judge Craig Estlinbaum decided that his constitutional right to a speedy trial had not been violated. While Estlinbaum found the state negligent in failing to retry Hartfield, and agreed that the man's ability to adequately defend himself had sharply diminished, he also found that it was essentially Hartfield's own fault. Jerry Hartfield remains in prison 34 years after his murder conviction was overturned because he never knew to ask for a new trial . As The Atlantic put it, that's more than 12,000 days waiting for justice. The Bay City native was convicted of robbing and killing a bus station worker in 1976, the Daily News reported. Hartfield's IQ has been estimated at . around 51. He has long maintained his innocence, claiming police used a . false confession in the case. He was initially sentenced to die but in 1980 the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals overturned the conviction, ruling that a juror had been improperly dismissed for airing concerns about capital punishment. Prosecutors have tried and failed twice to get the court to reconsider. Since then, Hartfield's case has met with one legal obstacle after another. Hartfield was on death row before a Texas governor commuted his sentence in the wake of his overturned conviction . In 1983, then-Governor Mark White commuted his sentence to life at the request of prison officials. According to Jeffrey Newberry of the Texas Innocent Project, it's uncertain whether White even knew the conviction had been overturned. But, Newberry added, the commutation was actually issued in error. 'He couldn't commute the sentence because there was nothing left to . commute,' Newberry said. 'Mr. Hartfield should . have had a new trial. But he didn't get one.' Because Hartfield had no legal counsel after his trial 'he just sat there,' Newberry said. Hartfield didn't understand he needed to ask for a new trial until a fellow inmate advised him in 2006. 'Someone helped him write documents on his own saying 'Hey, I never got . my new trial,'' Newberry said. Hartfield's IQ is estimated at around 51 and he has long maintained police used a false confession to put him behind bars . Newberry is appealing the most recent ruling, . Hartfield was finally issued a court-appointed attorney after sending in handwritten legal filings. As his case was passed between federal and state courts over the next 8 years, somehow the pick-axe allegedly used in the murder was lost. Even worse for his chances, key witnesses have died. Yet after so many years behind bars, Hartfield said he is not bitter and has become a Christian. 'Being a God-fearing person, he doesn't allow me to be bitter,' he said in a 2013 interview. 'He allows me to be forgiving.' A hearing on separate proceedings to retry his criminal case is scheduled for next month.","Jerry Hartfield was sentenced to death row in 1976 but his conviction was overturned four years later .

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . The Archbishop's remarks will fuel criticism of welfare reforms . Families have been left ‘broken and weeping’ by hunger and debt despite the country’s economic recovery, the Archbishop of Canterbury will say in his Easter Sunday sermon today. In outspoken remarks that will refuel attacks on the Government’s welfare policies, Archbishop Justin Welby will say many struggling families are ‘too ashamed’ to seek help from food banks, which critics claim are increasingly filling a gap created by benefit cuts. His sermon in Canterbury Cathedral follows a letter from 600 religious leaders, including more than 40 Anglican bishops, urging David Cameron to tackle a ‘national crisis’ of rising hunger as the latest figures suggest more than a million Britons have used food banks in the past year. Although the letter was not signed by Archbishop Welby, his remarks will be seen as endorsing its concerns. Preaching about Mary Magdalene’s tears after discovering Christ’s empty tomb, the Archbishop also refers to the suffering of communities. He will say: ‘With Mary there are so many that weep. ‘In Syria, mothers cry for their children and husbands. In the Ukraine, neighbours cry because the future is precarious and dangerous. In Rwanda, tears are still shed each day as the horror of genocide is remembered. In this country, even as the economy improves, there is weeping in broken families, in people ashamed to seek help from food banks, or frightened by debt. Asylum seekers weep with loneliness and missing far-away families. Mary continues to weep across the world.’ But the Archbishop will go on to say Christ’s resurrection brings hope and joy, which can ‘exist alongside mental illness, depression, bereavement and fear’ and that ‘joy in the huge life of Jesus is present in the food banks, the credit unions, the practical down-to-earth living that the churches are demonstrating across this country’.","Comments will fuel criticism of Government's welfare reforms .
