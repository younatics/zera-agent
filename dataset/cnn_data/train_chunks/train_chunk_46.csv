"(CNN) -- The images of Neda Agha Soltan's death on the streets of Tehran transformed her into an icon for Iran's opposition movement. But very few know of Ramin Ramezani, who was killed five days before Neda during last year's post-election demonstrations in the Iranian capital. ""I always say Neda is the miracle of the century,"" Ramin's mother Zahra Ramezani told CNN by phone. ""Neda was destined to be known to everyone. If Ramin isn't known to everyone, that's OK."" Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's landslide re-election on June 12, 2009, had sparked the biggest protests in Iran since the 1979 revolution. The following Monday, hundreds of thousands marched to Tehran's Azadi square, calling the vote a sham. Ramin was among the crowd. Watch YouTube video of the chaos that day . Ramin was on leave from military duty, back in Tehran to celebrate his 22nd birthday, just six days away. His parents told CNN that he had voted for Mir Hossein Moussavi, the opposition candidate who had energized young Iranians with promises of a freer society, more rights for women, and better relations with the West. Around 6 p.m. that day, Ramin called his parents and told them not to worry, they said. He said he'd be home later that evening. An hour later, just blocks away from Azadi square, violence erupted at a base for the Basij, Iran's pro-government militia. Protesters surrounded the building, shattered its windows with rocks, and set fire to several rooms. Amateur video from the scene showed several armed members of the Basij on the rooftop apparently firing shots. It was here, Ramin's parents said, that their son was killed. A single bullet entered the right side of his chest, tore through both his lungs and killed him within minutes, his parents said. There was no way to know who fired the shot. It is widely believed that Ramin and several others who were killed on June 15 were the first casualties of the opposition movement's protests. When Ramin didn't show up at home, the Ramezanis stayed up all night trying to reach him. Zahra Ramezani said she called Ramin's cell phone every hour but no one answered. The following day they received a brief call from a man who did not identify himself. ""He said, 'If you want your son's remains,' and as soon as he said 'remains' there was chaos in our home,"" said Zahra Ramezani. ""We were all hitting ourselves, screaming and shouting."" For Ramin's parents the nightmare was just beginning. Over the course of a week, they said they searched for Ramin's remains in five hospitals. They pleaded with officials at two courthouses and the interior ministry to help them find their son's body. Authorities said they would investigate. Finally, at a prison morgue, a prison official showed Ramin's father the picture of his son's remains on a computer screen. ""For about one hour I lost myself,"" Mehdi Ramezani said. ""I was hitting myself in the face and the head, asking, 'Why is my son's naked remains on this monitor?'"" Mehdi Ramezani said an official at the prison morgue warned him to keep quiet about his son's death. ""They made me promise them not to cause a big commotion during his funeral,"" Mehdi Ramezani said. ""They said it wouldn't be good for your future and the future of your children."" Calls to Iran's judiciary and security officials seeking comment were not returned. Until now, Zahra and Mehdi Ramezani have never spoken to the international media. But after keeping silent for more than nine months, they still don't know any more about how their son died. ""They still haven't told us anything,"" Zahra Ramezani said. ""They said, 'We didn't shoot him.' Then who shot him?"" Human rights groups say around 80 people were killed during Iran's 2009 post-election protests, while Iran's government puts the number at about half of that. While Iran has charged prison officials with torturing to death some of those detained after the demonstrations, no one has been charged in any of the deaths during the protests. Authorities in Iran have told CNN they are investigating the deaths, but the Ramezanis say they are losing hope. Every Friday morning the Ramezanis visit Tehran's main cemetery where their son's gravesite sits just steps away from Neda Agha Soltan's. Ramin's parents say they don't want the attention Neda is getting. All they want is someone to tell them who killed these two young Iranians and why. ""A good and ideal government is for everyone, even those who oppose it,"" said Zahra Ramezani. ""If they consider themselves servants of Iran, then they owe us something.""","Parents of slain protester wants to know who killed their son .

"London, England (CNN) -- British Airways carried out its threat Wednesday and stripped striking cabin crew members of their travel perks. Staff who joined the strike last weekend will now lose benefits including free and heavily discounted travel, BA said. ""Letters are going out to staff who took industrial action concerning staff travel,"" a statement from the airline said. ""Our cabin crew knew that if they took part in the strike they would lose their staff travel permanently. ""Staff travel offers heavily discounted travel to airline employees. This is a non-contractual perk that the company can withdraw at its discretion."" BA Chief Executive Willie Walsh had threatened last week to take away the travel perks, which may have been one reason why some union staff agreed to work despite the strike last weekend. Are you worried about the strike? The airline said Wednesday it is expanding its flight schedules this weekend ahead of a second round of strikes because more staff are willing to cross the picket lines. The planned four-day walkout follows the one last weekend by crews dissatisfied with pay, benefits and staffing levels. BA will be able to run a full operation from London's Gatwick Airport and London City Airport this weekend because so many cabin crew members will be working as normal, the airline said in a statement late Tuesday. At London's Heathrow Airport, BA will be able to run up to 55 percent of its short-haul flights and up to 70 percent of its long-haul flights, the airline said. ""As a result of the numbers of crew wanting to work, we are increasing significantly our flying schedule and will be operating a full schedule at Gatwick and London City airports,"" Walsh said in a statement. ""I would like to thank all our customers for their patience and support. I apologize to those whose flights will regrettably have to be canceled at Heathrow because of Unite's continuing action."" Unite is the union representing 95 percent of BA's 15,000 cabin crew members. Passengers booked on flights that have been canceled by the strike will be offered seats on flights with BA or other airlines, or will be offered a full refund, the airline said. British Airways advised passengers to regularly check its Web site, www.ba.com, to see whether their flight is still operating. Passengers should contact British Airways or their travel agent instead of going to the airport if their flight has been canceled, BA advised. Advice for passengers . British Airways and Unite have been at odds for more than a year over changes the airline wants to make to cabin crew pay and work practices. BA says the changes will save the company more than 60 million pounds ($90 million) a year. Unite has said the plans, which call for longer work hours and less staffing, will damage customer service and the BA brand. In addition, stock analysts said BA has made clear it sees the action not only as a matter of money but who will run the airline -- management or the union.","BA carries out threat to strip striking cabin crew members of travel perks .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The World Motor Sport Council (WMSC) of the FIA, motor sport's governing body, has fined McLaren -- the team at the center of the ""spygate"" scandal -- $100m and stripped it of its constructors' championship points for the season. And McLaren faces further penalties when the WMSC reconvenes in December 2007. McLaren must submit a full technical report on its 2008 car. If the WMSC considers that its design was influenced by confidential Ferrari data, then sanctions may be imposed on the team for the 2008 season. McLaren team chief Ron Dennis arrives for the hearing in Paris. In an official press statement, the FIA stated: ""The WMSC has stripped Vodafone McLaren Mercedes of all constructor points in the 2007 FIA Formula One World Championship and the team can score no points for the remainder of the season. ""Furthermore, the team will pay a fine equal to $100m, less the FOM [Formula One Management] income lost as a result of the points deduction. ""However, due to the exceptional circumstances in which the FIA gave the team's drivers an immunity in return for providing evidence, there is no penalty in regard to drivers' points."" Should McLaren's drivers, Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton, win in any of the remaining races of the 2007 season no representatives of McLaren will be allowed on the podium. The WMSC is expected to announce the reasons for its decisions on September 14. In July the WMSC ruled that McLaren was in breach of Article 151c of the FIA International Sporting Code but recommended that no punitive measures were taken until a hearing of the FIA's International Court of Appeal on September 13. However, in the light of new evidence -- the source and nature of which remain undisclosed -- the WMSC is to reconvene in place of the Court of Appeal hearing. The murky story began in June of this year, when Ferrari sacked its performance director Nigel Stepney and initiated court proceedings against him in Modena, Italy. It then emerged that a 780-page document containing confidential technical data about Ferrari's F1 car had been found in the possession of McLaren's chief designer Mike Coughlan. Coughlan's wife, Trudy Coughlan, had taken the document for duplication at a copy shop near McLaren's Woking headquarters. An employee of the copy shop, suspicious that confidential data was being copied, blew the whistle to Ferrari. Ferrari suspected the source of the leak was Nigel Stepney, a friend and former colleague of Coughlan's (the pair had worked together at Lotus in the late 1980s). Stepney had been the team's chief mechanic, but in February took his new role as the team's performance director -- which did not require him to attend grands prix -- when he expressed his disquiet at the Ferrari's reorganization following the departure of technical director Ross Brawn. Ferrari filed a formal complaint against Stepney in Modena, Italy where the district attorney initiated a criminal investigation. Ferrari issued the following press statement: . ""Ferrari announces it has recently presented a case against Nigel Stepney and an engineer from the Vodafone McLaren-Mercedes team with the Modena Tribunal, concerning the theft of technical information. Furthermore, legal action has been instigated in England and a search warrant has been issued concerning the engineer. This produced a positive outcome."" McLaren promptly dismissed Mike Coughlan, its chief designer. It then emerged that Coughlan and Stepney had met with Honda F1 boss, Nick Fry, in June this year to discuss employment possibilities. However Honda were cleared of any wrongdoing by the FIA who were satisfied that no confidential material had been offered to or received by Honda. Coughlan and his wife appeared in the High Court in London for a preliminary hearing on July 10. Ferrari dropped the case in consideration of the Coughlan's full disclosure and promise of future cooperation. The furore seemed to cool down after the WMSC's verdict. Ferrari remained unhappy that McLaren had emerged from the scandal without penalty but the WMSC did not have sufficient evidence to enforce such a penalty. But now the FIA is in possession of new evidence. Rumors have centered on emails between McLaren test driver Pedro de la Rosa and reigning world champion Fernando Alonso. On August 31 Max Mosley the FIA president wrote letters to all three McLaren drivers -- de la Rosa, Alonso and Lewis Hamilton -- in which he stated: ""The FIA has subsequently been made aware of an allegation that one or more McLaren drivers may be in possession, or that such drivers have recently been in possession, of written evidence relevant to this investigation."" The letter continued: ""I can confirm, given the importance of this issue, that any information you may make available in response to this letter will not result in any proceedings against you under the International Sporting Code or the Formula One regulations. However, in the event that it later comes to light that you have withheld any potentially relevant information, serious consequences could follow."" Five days later the WMSC announced it was to reconvene ""following the emergence of new evidence"", in place of the Court of Appeal hearing. Other rumors had emerged regarding a mysterious white powder said to have been found on the fuel caps of the Ferraris of Kimi Raikkonen and Felipe Massa in practice leading up to the Monaco Grand Prix. Stepney has denied involvement in these sabotage claims or in the espionage case in general. Further drama overshadowed Alonso and Hamilton's one-two on the podium at the Italian Grand Prix on Sunday. Modena's public prosecutor, Giuseppe Tibis, issued a legal notice -- known as an 'avviso di garanzia' -- that six McLaren employees were under criminal investigation . The six included McLaren supremo Ron Dennis, managing directors Martin Whitmarsh and Jonathan Neale, technical director Jonathan Neale and designer Rob Taylor as well as Mike Coughlan. This outcome has put a dark shadow McLaren's return to winning ways. The team, dominant in the late 1990s, had struggled with reliability for some years. But the team is not taking the decision lying down. Martin Whitmarsh, COO of the McLaren Group said: ""We believe we have got the grounds for an appeal, but of course we are going to wait for the findings of the FIA.""

"(CNN) -- India racked up a massive first-innings lead of 347 runs over South Africa on the third day of the second cricket Test in Kolkata as V.V.S. Laxman and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni contributed centuries. The pair put on an unbroken 259 for the seventh wicket, with Laxman unbeaten on 143 and Dhoni on 132 when the declaration came at 643-6 in the final hour of Tuesday's play. Their efforts meant that four Indians had passed three figures, following Virender Sehwag's 165 on Monday and Sachin Tendulkar's 106, while four South African bowlers conceded more than 100 runs each. South Africa, who will return to the No. 1 Test ranking above India with a draw, reached 6-0 at stumps as only five balls of a scheduled 10 overs were able to be bowled due to bad light. India, who trail 1-0 in the two-match series, resumed the day on 342-5 with Laxman on nine and nightwatchman Amit Mishra on one. They extended their partnership to 48 before paceman Morne Morkel picked up his second wicket as Mishra was caught at second slip by Jacques Kallis, who had earlier dropped the batsman as did captain Graeme Smith. Laxman was dropped by J.P. Duminy on 48, and India reached lunch at 431-6 before piling on 117 runs in the two hours after the interval. Laxman completed his 15th Test century and Dhoni his fourth in only the second time that four Indian batsmen had reached three figures in the same innings. Meanwhile, New Zealand piled up 553-7 before declaring on the second day of the one-off Test against tourists Bangladesh in Hamilton. Martin Guptill (189) and Brendon McCullum (185) extended their sixth-wicket partnership to a national record of 339. Guptill scored his maiden Test ton while wicketkeeper McCullum celebrated his 50th appearance in the five-day game with his highest score. Seamer Rubel Hossain took both of their scalps in the middle session and ended with his first five-wicket bag, conceding 166 runs. Bangladesh reached 87-1 at stumps in their first innings, with opener Tamim Iqbal unbeaten on 56 after facing just 48 balls. He put on 79 for the first wicket with Imrul Kayes, who made 28 before edging spinner Daniel Vettori to Ross Taylor at slip.","India rack up a massive first-innings lead of 347 runs over South Africa in Kolkata .

"LOS ANGELES (CNN) -- Since he opened his first restaurant in the heart of Beverly Hills in the early eighties, Wolfgang Puck has gone on to become a household name in the U.S. Puck says L.A. has perfect weather, ""fabulous light and very little rain"" His chain of airport restaurants stretch across the states while his brand adorns everything from pizzas to non-stick pans. He lives in Los Angeles with his second wife and their two young children. CNN: What first drew you to L.A.? Wolfgang Puck: I came to the U.S. when I was 24. I spent a month in New York and a year in Indianapolis but I always dreamt about the beaches in California. I had a blue 1967 Cadillac. In 1974 I packed my suitcases, put them in a trailer and drove straight to L.A. It took me five days to drive from Indianapolis.  Watch Wolfgang Puck take CNN on a tour of L.A. » . CNN: What has kept you here all these years? Wolfgang Puck: In L.A. you live in a big city, but you feel like you're in the countryside. For example, I can be at home in the swimming pool and be five minutes from everything. It has the perfect weather -- the movie industry started here because of the fabulous light and very little rain. See pictures of Wolfgang Puck's Los Angeles . CNN: Does everyone in L.A. want to be an actor? Wolfgang Puck: It's a city of dreams. It's nice to dream but a lot of people forget it's very difficult. They think you become Cate Blanchett or Jack Nicholson just like that, but these people paid their dues. They forget how much time it took them to get there and how good they really are. CNN: You are the official caterer to the Oscars. It must an exciting event to be part of. Wolfgang Puck: When we cater the Governor's Ball, we have 300 people in the kitchen and 600 in the dining room. It goes very fast and it's done the right way. I remember Michael Caine came to Spago (Puck's flagship Beverly Hills eaterie) the Monday after the awards with his family and said could he get the same dish that he ate at the awards, which means we really nailed it. CNN: How has the city inspired your cooking? Wolfgang Puck: For me, cooking is an expression of the land where you are and the culture of that place. L.A. is a melting pot of many different cultures and we have fabulous ingredients here. If you go to San Diego, San Francisco you can get the best vegetables, the best fruits, sea food -- all these wonderful ingredients. CNN: How does L.A. compare with New York? Wolfgang Puck: New Yorkers think they have everything, all the best art and music. But really L.A. is a better place. Some of the most famous artists in the world work right here. CNN: You're a big fan of modern art. How did that start? Wolfgang Puck: I got interested in contemporary art because I worked in a restaurant right across the street from a gallery where they made prints for people like David Hockney. The artists came for lunch at the restaurant so I used to talk to them. Hockney made the first cover of my cook book; I had Andy Warhol do the label for our wine. I feel that painting is in some way like cooking -- if you add a little more blue, a little less blue it doesn't matter. The same thing with cooking: a little of this, a little bit more of that. As long as the end result is beautiful, that's what counts. CNN: If L.A. was personified, what would they be like? Wolfgang Puck: A person who enjoys themselves. They do a great job at work but also can have a good time. To me that's what life is all about.","Puck arrived in L.A. in a blue 1967 Cadillac, driving five days from the Midwest .

"(CNN)  -- In a major upset, Evan Lysacek of the United States edged out defending gold medalist Russian Evgeni Plushenko to win the men's figure skating gold medal. It was the first time since the 1988 Winter Games in Calgary -- where Brian Boitano won for the United States -- that any nation other than Russia has won the men's gold medal in the event. In a first for Japan on the men's podium, Daisuke Takahashi of Japan took the bronze. Lysacek, who placed fourth at the Turin Games in 2006, won after the free skate program with a total score of 257.67, which bettered Plushenko's score of 256.36. Takahashi's score of 247.23 came just a little more than half a point better than fourth place finisher Stephane Lambiel of Switzerland. Lysacek's triumph brought to six the number of golds and 18 the number of total medals the United States has, the most of any nation so far. Earlier, Lindsey Vonn crashed out in the slalom section, opening the door for Maria Riesch of Germany to take the gold medal in the super-combined at the Vancouver Winter Olympics. The poster girl of the Winter Games led after the downhill section of the two-discipline event, but chasing down Riesch's combined target time of two minutes 10.08 seconds came unstuck halfway down her slalom run at Whistler Creekside. Vonn's teammate Julia Mancuso added to her silver in the downhill behind Vonn 24 hours previously with another second-placed finish, but over a second behind Riesch. Sweden's Anja Paerson, who suffered a crashing fall in the downhill on Wednesday, was rewarded for her brave decision to compete with a bronze medal after a fine slalom run. Vonn's downhill time of one minute 24.16 seconds left her 0.33 seconds clear of her great friend Riesch, with Mancuso of the United States in third place, and she seemingly had a second gold in two days firmly in her grasp. But the 25-year-old from Minnesota admitted after the downhill section that the shin injury which troubled her in the build-up to the Games was a problem and may present difficulties as she bids for gold in three other disciplines. ""It's not good. It's really hurting and I'm just struggling with it,"" Vonn said. ""But there's nothing really I can do. I just have to try to do therapy and try to tough it out today and then tomorrow will be a good day off."" Riesch, who was a disappointing eighth on her Olympic debut in the downhill, looked much more assured in her second event and was always set to be the major challenger to Vonn as she has been throughout the World Cup season. Hosts Canada gained their third gold of the Games as Christine Nesbitt powered to victory in the women's 1,000 speed skating event at the Richmond Oval. Nesbitt had just 0.02 seconds in hand over Annette Gerritsen of the Netherlands with another Dutch skater Laurine Van Riessen taking bronze. In other early action on day seven, Norway's Tora Berger upset the favorites to claim her country's 100th gold in the Winter Olympics with victory in the women's 15k individual biathlon. Berger missed just one shot to beat Kazakhstan's Elena Khrustaleva by 20.7 seconds. And the 101st gold was not long coming in the later men's 20km individual event as Emile Hegle Svendsen claimed victory ahead of legendary compatriot Ole Einar Bjoerndalen, who was winning his 10th Olympic medal, including five golds. Bjoerndalen tied for silver with Belarus competitor Sergey Novikov, 9.5 seconds behind Svendsen. In women's snowboarding, the half-pipe crown went to Torah Bright of Australia ahead of American pair Hanna Teter and Kelly Clark after a thrilling competition which set new standards.","NEW: American Evan Lysacek breaks Russia's five Winter Olympic Game-streak .

"London, England (CNN) -- Katie Piper had everything going for her -- a blossoming career, a wonderful life and a beautiful face. But that all changed after a horrific acid attack in March 2008 destroyed everything as she knew it. The young model and television presenter, who was 24 years old at the time, was leaving her apartment in a London suburb when she was attacked by a stranger waiting for her with a cup of sulfuric acid. Stefan Sylvestre threw the cup of corrosive liquid on Piper, burning the skin on her face, neck, chest and hands. She was also left blinded in one eye. Sylvestre was asked by Piper's former boyfriend, Danny Lynch, to throw the acid on her face because she ended their short relationship. To make matters worse, two days before the attack, Piper was raped by Lynch in a London hotel room after ending the partnership. ""It wasn't a random attack and there was a motive if you like,"" Piper told CNN's Becky Anderson on Connect the World. Meanwhile Piper's parents were called by the police to tell them what had happened. ""I can remember going 'not her face, please not her face',"" Piper's mother Diane wrote on The Katie Piper Foundation web site. ""I knew if anything happened to her face as far as she was concerned it would be the end of everything."" Piper spent nearly two months in hospital and was placed in an induced coma for 10 days. The attack also severely damaged Piper's throat and she was forced to be fed through a tube in her stomach. Today, Piper now wears a special plastic pressure mask for 23 hours a day, in an effort to flatten her scars. ""You can see looking at me that it physically changed my appearance, but it goes a lot deeper than that."" ""It changed my life as I know it -- it changed my career, it changed my relationships with people. Lynch was found guilty of inciting the acid attack in October 2008 and subsequently convicted on the rape charge in April 2009. He was given two life sentences, and will serve at least 16 years in jail. Sylvestre received a 12-year sentence for throwing the acid. With her attackers behind bars, Piper is determined to get her life back on track and rebuild what she can. ""Time was a great healer and I've managed to not get my old life back, but I can  rebuild. And I think I've stayed focused and determined."" ""It was an attack with the intent to destroy me, and I decided that it wouldn't destroy me and that I would still have a life. I try to stay positive."" Piper has told her story around the world and has started the Katie Piper Foundation to help raise money for burns victims across the UK. Since the attack Piper has made remarkable progress. Surgeons took the drastic measure to remove the skin from Piper's entire face and use a skin substitute called Matriderm to re-build the foundations before grafting skin from her back and buttock onto her face -- it's the first operation of its kind to be done in one operation, according to Piper's Web site. Piper plans to continue her work raising money for burn victims and to help spread the message that there is life after difficult challenges. ""I think it's important to try and set yourself many goals -- try to take each day as it comes,"" Piper said. ""I think there's a lot of strength that can be gathered from support.""","A cup of acid was thrown onto Katie Piper's face in March 2008 .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Iraq has ordered former employees of the private military contractor once known as Blackwater to leave the country, its interior minister announced Wednesday. Contractors who once worked for Blackwater, now known as Xe, have seven days to leave Iraq, Interior Minister Jawad al-Bolani told the state television network al-Iraqiya. The move follows a January declaration by Iraq's government that former Blackwater employees were no longer welcome in the country. Blackwater became the target of widespread Iraqi outrage after its contractors were involved in the September 2007 shooting in Baghdad's Nisoor Square that left 17 civilians dead. That outrage was renewed in December, when a U.S. judge dismissed manslaughter charges against five guards involved in the shootings on constitutional grounds. The company's last contracts in Iraq have been transferred to other companies. But Iraqi authorities say about 250 former Blackwater employees remain behind, some working for other security firms. ""I don't think the Iraqi government is willing to have any Blackwater member, even if they are working in other companies,"" government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh told CNN in January. ""We don't like to see them here working in any company."" Blackwater had about 1,000 contractors working in Iraq at the height of its involvement, guarding diplomatic convoys and supply vehicles around the country after the U.S. invasion in 2003. At least 10 of its employees were killed, including four whose burned and mutilated bodies were dragged through the streets of Fallujah after an ambush in 2004. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh and Suzanne Simons contributed to this report.","Former Blackwater (now known as Xe) employees must leave Iraq, Iraqi officials say .

"(CNN) -- Prague has not been nicknamed ""Zlata Praha"" or ""Golden Prague"" for no good reason. The well-deserved eponym is a tribute to this city that mixes architecture, history, art and beauty like no other. While not forgetting its more somber communist past, Prague has been one of the first East European cities to get a luxurious makeover. Designer shopping malls, exclusive restaurants and trendy nightclubs abound. But it is the mystical atmosphere of a Prague of past eras that leaves many visitors craving to come back. Largely untouched by the ravages of WWII, Prague is arguably the only European city with so many century-old buildings left intact for people to enjoy. All more impressive than the others, these are the historical sites you should not miss in Prague. Wenceslas Square: In 1348, King Charles IV of Bohemia (now the Czech Republic) founded the town of Prague. The King built several open areas for markets, including Wenceslas Square, previously known as the Horse Market. Named after Saint Wenceslas, the patron saint of the Czech state, the square is the largest in the city and was at the center of much of Prague's history, including the Nazi occupation, the Soviet invasion, and the Velvet Revolution. In 1969, Prague student Jan Palach set himself on fire in Wenceslas Square to protest the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. And in 1989, during the Velvet Revolution that overthrew the Communist regime, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators gathered here to protest. Today the square has become one of the trendiest and busiest in the country. Lining Wenceslas Square are fashion stores, cafes, bars and kiosks. Above the square is Prague's Museum of Natural History, which was shot at by Communist troops when they mistook it for the Parliament building. Prague Castle: Kings, Roman Emperors and Presidents have lived in this legendary castle that overlooks the city. The castle is the largest medieval castle complex in Europe and arguable Prague's prime tourist attraction. First built in the 9th century, Prague Castle has survived wars, fires and opposing political powers. The castle complex consists of the Saint Virtus Cathedral, viewing towers, a monastery, museums and art galleries. The Czech crown jewels are also held here. After Czechoslovakia split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993, the castle became the seat of the President of the new Czech Republic. Charles Bridge: This magnificent 14th century gothic bridge over Prague's Vltava river is lined with a series of large stone statues that represent important religious figures and icons. Its construction started in 1357 under King Charles IV and finished in the beginning of the 15th century. Until the 19th century, the bridge was the only way to cross between the Old Town and adjacent areas, also known as the ""Lesser Town."" During the day, thousands of people traverse the bridge to watch the views of the city and enjoy the numerous street performers. Dancing House: A masterpiece of modern architecture, Dancing House was named after dancing duo Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Dancing House is also sometimes nicknamed ""Drunk House"" for its wavy curves. The building was constructed between 1992 and 1996 by Czech architect Vlado Milunc and world-renowned Canadian architect Frank Gehry. The top floor houses one of the city's most exclusive restaurants, Celeste. Old Town Square: Located in the heart of the Old Town, this square included Prague's gothic Church of Our Lady before Tyn, the main church of this part of the city since the 14th century. The church's towers are 80 meters high and topped by small golden spires. Another fixture of the Old Town Square is the baroque-style St. Nicholas Church. In the center of the square is a large statue of Jan Hus, a Catholic priest who was burned at the stake by the Roman Catholic Church for heresy in 1415. But the most popular attraction for visitors of the square is the famous Astronomical Clock. Astronomical Clock: Built in 1410, the Astronomical Clock still functions and provides accurate data on a number of astrological events, such as the relative positions of the sun, moon and major planets. Each hour, the clock bells and a series of moving wooden puppets come out. Below the Astronomical Clock are 12 medallions with the signs of the zodiac, added by painter Josef Manes in 1865. Prague Cathedral: Saint Vitus's Cathedral is another one of Prague's Gothic masterpieces. The Cathedral, set in the walls of the Prague Castle, was commissioned by King Charles IV and work on it began in 1344. It took nearly six centuries to complete. Today it is the seat of the Archbishop of Prague and contains the tombs of many of the Bohemian Kings. The interior features stained-glass windows from different eras. One of the cathedral's chambers was used to crown several Kings and it is said the room can only be opened with seven golden keys given to different members of parliament. Vyshehrad: The old fortress of Vyshehrad and its surrounding parks is the place where the city of Prague was originally founded and around which the city was built. It is a great place to get a sense of the history of the city. Its thick walls house the National Cemetery, where many of Prague's most illustrious citizens are buried, including Czech composer Antonín Leopold Dvorak and writer Karel Capek.","""Golden City"" is a well-deserved eponym for a city that mixes history and beauty like no other .

"(CNN) -- Ivo Josipovic won the runoff election Sunday for Croatia's presidency, a spokesman for the election commission told CNN. Social Democratic Party candidate Josipovic won 60.3 percent of the vote, or about 1.3 million of the nearly 2.3 million votes cast, said spokesman Hrvoje Sadaric of the Croatian State Election Commission. Milan Bandic, an independent and eight-year mayor of the Croatian capital of Zagreb, garnered 39.71 percent of the vote, or just over 880,000 votes. He was once a member of Josipovic's party, Sadaric said. Slightly more than half of voting eligible Croatians voted in the runoff and more than 99 percent of votes had been counted, Sadaric said. Josipovic, 52, a law professor and classical music composer, had earlier garnered the most votes in the first round of voting.

"ONBOARD AN AIR FORCE C-17 OVER HAITI (CNN) -- Bypassing the gridlock of Haiti's main airport and congestion of roadways in the earthquake-ravaged country, the U.S. military delivered badly needed food and water on Monday by parachute. A C-17 cargo plane left Pope Air Force Base in North Carolina shortly after noon, and three hours later dropped 40 pallets -- or ""bundles"" as the Air Force refers to them as -- holding bottled water and Meals, Ready-to-Eat, or MREs, on a field just north of the Port-au-Prince airport in Haiti. It was the first airdrop of humanitarian supplies by the U.S. military into Haiti since the deadly earthquake there nearly a week ago. ""There are so many relief agencies funneling through the airport that it has kind of created a bottleneck,"" U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Leon Strickland told CNN en route to the drop point. ""We're going to put things directly out of the air onto the ground and open up another distribution point north of the [Port-au-Prince] airfield."" The mission came just three days after Defense Secretary Robert Gates told reporters at the Pentagon that he thought such airdrops would pose serious problems, especially with crowd control.  See complete coverage of quake in Haiti . ""It seems to me that, without having any structure on the ground in terms of distribution, that an airdrop is simply going to lead to riots as people try and go after that stuff. So without any structure for distribution or to provide security when things become available, then it seems to me that's a formula for contributing to chaos rather than -- rather than preventing it,"" Gates said. Strickland, commander of the airdrop mission, said safety of the Haitians was still a consideration, but the military had taken steps to insure control over the distribution. iReport: People continue looking for loved ones in Haiti . ""We are obviously concerned about the welfare of the people on the ground,"" he said, adding, ""I'm confident that our members on the ground have created a secure environment for us to conduct airdrop operations."" This first flight carried a total of 9,600 bottles of water and 42,000 MRE packets. One MRE is usually considered one meal for a U.S. soldier in combat, but there is enough food in an MRE packet to make a small meal for two people. Most of the food in an MRE can be eaten straight from the plastic vacuum-packed pouch. But if water is added to a chemical heater, a hot meal results. Each pallet was rigged with a large parachute as well as special corrugated cardboard padding that would minimize damage to the water and food when the load hit the ground. One of the supervisors on the rigging crew at the Army's Fort Bragg, which is adjacent to Pope Air Force Base, said they wanted to make sure as much of the aid, especially the water, survived the airdrop, but they predicted as many as 1-in-10 of the bottles would break on impact. The MREs are much less susceptible to damage during airdrops.  Get latest developments on situation in Haiti . As the C-17 approached Haiti, the pilot dropped to 600 feet above the ground and opened the huge rear ramp. When a computer in the cockpit calculated that the plane was over the drop zone, a signal was given, the pilot pitched the plane upward and the huge straps and gate that held the cargo in place were released. Within seconds, gravity pulled all 40 pallets out of the plane and the parachutes automatically deployed. In less than a minute the food and water was on the ground, ready to be unpacked and distributed. Maj. Jeff ""Ratdog"" Daniels, the pilot of the C-17, said the U.S. military teams waiting for the airdrop on the ground reported all 40 parachutes opened properly and all the bundles landed on target in the planned drop zone.  CNN's Impact Your World . While this airdrop is a first for the military effort in Haiti, the Air Force is well-practiced in this type of mission. Almost daily, Air Force cargo planes drop food and water into remote areas of Afghanistan for U.S. troops fighting there.

She was among dozens of soldiers at Fort Bragg who hand-packed and rigged the bundles of humanitarian aid that were dropped Monday. The military planned to use Monday's flight as a test to see if airdrops would be a practical and effective way to continue to deliver aid. The decision on whether to do more airdrops not immediately made, but just after returning to Pope AFB, Strickland said of the mission, ""It was a success.""","40 pallets with bottled water and Meals, Ready-to-Eat, dropped on a field just north airport .

"(CNN) -- William Ward Warren was 15 when his dad dropped him off at Dallas Love Field to see President John F. Kennedy arrive in the city, on the same day JFK was assassinated. Students in Dallas, Texas, had November 22, 1963, off from school in recognition of the visit. Warren decided to take along his 8mm camera. The result was ""the best home movie known to exist of the Kennedy arrival,"" according to Gary Mack, curator of the The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza. The color film offers new glimpses of the president and Mrs. Kennedy, wearing a pink Chanel suit, coming down the steps from Air Force One and greeting well-wishers. The Kennedys can then be seen from the side as they walk past the camera smiling. Vice President Lyndon Johnson is seen close up as he greets people standing on the tarmac. ""I was very excited,"" says Warren, now 61. ""It had rained the night before and cleared off that next day, which was an interesting event, and it was a very positive day. It was cool and yet the sun was shining bright, and there was lots of excitement."" Warren donated the 8mm color home movie to the museum, Mack said in a news release. According to the news release, the only color images of President Kennedy in Dallas were made by amateurs, except for a brief film by a White House photographer. The museum is on the sixth and seventh floors of what was known in 1963 as the Texas School Book Depository. The Warren Commission determined that Lee Harvey Oswald shot Kennedy from that location.","Boy, 15, took color 8mm film of Kennedy's arrival at airport in Dallas, Texas .

"(CNN) -- All but one of the families who lost relatives in Baghdad's Nusoor Square killings have agreed to settle their claims against the security contractor formerly known as Blackwater, one of the survivors said Sunday. Hassan Salman, who was wounded in the 2007 shootings, told CNN that 16 of the 17 families of the dead agreed to $100,000 lawsuit settlements from Xe, as Blackwater now calls itself. Those wounded were offered between $20,000 and $50,000 apiece, Salman said. Blackwater guards protecting a U.S. State Department convoy opened fire in Nusoor Square, in western Baghdad, in October 2007, killing 17 people and wounding more than two dozen. Blackwater denied any wrongdoing, arguing its contractors used necessary force to protect a State Department convoy that had come under fire from insurgents. Iraq called the killings unprovoked and an act of ""premeditated murder."" The incident led the Iraqi government to slap limits on security contractors hired by Xe and other firms operating in the country. Xe announced it was settling the lawsuit last week to allow the company, which is also under new management, to move ahead ""free of the costs and distraction of ongoing litigation."" One of the guards who took part in the shooting pleaded guilty to a voluntary manslaughter charge in a U.S. court 2008. Five others were charged with manslaughter, but those cases were dismissed in late December when a federal judge found prosecutors wrongly used the men's own statements against them. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","Families of slain offered $100,000 to settle lawsuit, survivor of shooting says .

"(CNN)  -- We're just going to put it out there: Behind closed doors, whites talk differently about blacks. At least that's what two sociologists found after conducting a study of college students across the country. One of the researchers, Joe Feagin, said that's why it comes as no surprise to him that a powerful politician such as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid would talk about Barack Obama's skin color and use the term ""Negro dialect"" in what he considered a private conversation. Speaking not of Reid but of his conclusions drawn from his research, Feagin said, ""Most whites have sharply reduced the blatantly racist stuff they do in public, while they still do huge amounts in private."" ""It's just social correctness in the front stage. The scale of this is gigantic on the backstage, which is why the notion of a post-racial America is laughable,"" said Feagin, a professor at Texas A&M University. ""And I think most whites know it because they've been to Thanksgiving dinner with Uncle Jim and have heard the n-word jokes."" Feagin and Leslie Picca of the University of Dayton compiled their research in a book called ""Two-Faced Racism"" published in 2007. They surveyed 626 white students at 28 colleges and universities across the country. They asked the students to keep diaries and record any racial events they came across during the course of a day. The students recorded 9,000 accounts, of which 7,500 were ""blatantly racist"" events ranging from private jokes and conversations to violent incidents, Feagin said. About 100 accounts stood up against racism, he said. The majority of racial events were directed at African-Americans, but Latinos and Asians also came under attack. Feagin and Picca also surveyed African-American students, but that research is still being compiled. ""In these 7,500 blatant accounts, most of them are accounts of what we call backstage racism -- that is they're doing these performances and skits with friends and relatives,"" Feagin said. Does it surprise him that someone with such political clout as Reid would use a term such as ""Negro dialect""? ""No,"" Feagin said, ""not after looking at our student diaries."" He said Reid ""felt safe making"" the comment about Obama because he was in a private setting. ""It's a great teaching moment,"" Feagin said. ""It shows the difference between the front stage and the backstage. He thought he was saying that in the backstage, and now it's been brought out in the public for all to see and discuss."" The controversy is centered on remarks published in the book ""Game Change"" by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann. The book cites Reid as saying privately in 2008 that Obama could succeed as a black candidate partly because of his ""light-skinned"" appearance and speaking patterns ""with no Negro dialect, unless he wanted to have one."" Reid, D-Nevada, apologized to the president after excerpts from the book were released, and Obama said he considered the issue closed. Your take: iReporters sound off on the issue . ""This is a good man who's always been on the right side of history,"" Obama said Monday in a sit-down interview with CNN political contributor Roland Martin. ""For him to have used some inartful language in trying to praise me, and for people to try to make hay out of that, makes absolutely no sense."" Reid has received the support of the Congressional Black Caucus. On Monday, he said numerous prominent African-American officials, including NAACP Chairman Julian Bond and Attorney General Eric Holder, called to offer their support. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, head of the GOP's Senate campaign arm, has called for Reid to give up his leadership post after the ""embarrassing and racially insensitive"" remarks. Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele also called for Reid to step down. Duke University political science professor Kerry Haynie said he doesn't dispute that attitudes toward race may be viewed differently in private than in public. But he said he doesn't feel that came into play with Reid's remarks. ""Many of us who work in areas of race and politics asked these same kinds of questions, about whether Obama is different for whites than other black politicians,"" Haynie said. ""I don't think Sen. Reid was expressing sentiments he would not have expressed publicly."" Boyce Watkins, an associate professor at Syracuse University, said the country shouldn't let this moment pass. ""The takeaway is that there is a teachable moment, but we can't allow politicians to do all the teaching,"" Watkins told CNN's ""American Morning."" ""If you watched President Obama's interview with Roland Martin, the conversation tends to be let's sweep this under the rug and throw the baby out with the bath water and move on. ""But the truth is that they are trying to get health care passed, and that's good, I respect that, but I want to have the conversation on race."" Added Dawn Turner Trice, a columnist and blogger with the Chicago Tribune: ""For me, it's that we have to continue to talk about this. We can't only talk about it when we have these national flare-ups. This takes time and nuanced conversations. ... ""The country is changing. In a couple decades, we will have a country with a very different racial makeup. And we will have to have these conversations, and it's to our peril if we don't."" Feagin, the sociologist, said he agrees. He said Democrats and Obama should come forward to talk openly about the national climate on race. ""We can't keep ducking this racism stuff,"" he said. CNN's Matt Cherry contributed to this report.","Sociologists find whites talk differently about African-Americans in private .

"(CNN) -- Philippine authorities on Sunday raised the alert status of the country's most active volcano to level 4 and established an extended danger zone around it, saying an eruption is imminent. The status change at the Mayon volcano ""means that a hazardous explosive eruption is possible within days,"" according to the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology. Earlier Sunday, the institute said the central Philippine volcano continues ""to exhibit a high level of activity,"" adding that 222 volcanic quakes and tremors have been recorded in recent days. One was ""an explosion-type earthquake"" that launched a cloud of ash about 1,640 feet (500 meters) into the air, according to an institute statement. The institute recommended extending already-established danger zones of nearly five miles (8 kilometers) south of the summit and 4.3 miles (7 kilometers) north of the summit. In addition, ""areas just outside of this extended danger zone should prepare for evacuation in the event explosive eruptions intensify,"" the institute said. More than 30,000 people fled their homes last week ahead of an expected eruption, and authorities were attempting to evacuate about 50,000 people living around the 8,077-foot volcano. People in surrounding Albay province have flocked to town centers to catch a glimpse of glowing lava cascading down the slopes of Mayon since the mountain began oozing fiery lava and belching clouds of ash last week. The volcano, about 310 (500 kilometers) south of the Philippine capital of Manila, has erupted 49 times since its first documented eruption in 1616. The Philippines is situated in the so-called Ring of Fire, an arc of fault lines circling the Pacific Basin that is prone to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. In 1814, Mayon had its most violent eruption, killing more than 1,200 people. Its last major eruption was in 1993. Since then, it has remained restless, emitting ash and spewing lava.","""Hazardous explosive eruption is possible within days,"" Philippine authorities say .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Marine Lance Cpl. Joshua Bleill lost both his legs above the knees when a bomb exploded under his Humvee while on patrol in Iraq on October 15, 2006. He has 32 pins in his hip and a 6-inch screw holding his pelvis together. Joshua Bleill, pictured here with his girlfriend, is walking again with the aid of prosthetics outfitted with Bluetooth. Now, he's starting to walk again with the help of prosthetic legs outfitted with Bluetooth technology more commonly associated with hands-free cell phones. ""They're the latest and greatest,"" Bleill said, referring to his groundbreaking artificial legs. Bleill, 30, is one of two Iraq war veterans, both double leg amputees, to use the Bluetooth prosthetics. Computer chips in each leg send signals to motors in the artificial joints so the knees and ankles move in a coordinated fashion. Bleill's set of prosthetics have Bluetooth receivers strapped to the ankle area. The Bluetooth device on each leg tells the other leg what it's doing, how it's moving, whether walking, standing or climbing steps, for example. ""They mimic each other, so for stride length, for amount of force coming up, going uphill, downhill and such, they can vary speed and then to stop them again,"" Bleill told CNN from Walter Reed Army Medical Center, where he's undergoing rehab. ""I will put resistance with my own thigh muscles to slow them down, so I can stop walking, which is always nice.""  Watch Bleill demonstrate his legs » . Bluetooth is the name for short-range wireless technology that can connect computers to printers, MP3 players to speakers and -- perhaps the most well-known use -- cell phones to ear pieces. Older models of computer-controlled legs have to be ""programmed"" via wire by laptop computers before the amputee can use them. Those legs required more movement from the amputee's remaining thigh muscle to generate motion in the prosthetic leg. Because of built-in motors, the Bluetooth legs allow Bleill to walk longer before he tires. ""We've compared walking several laps in both sets of legs and one, your legs come out burning and tired and these, you know, you sometimes are not even breaking a sweat yet."" Bleill says the technology also means he spends less time in a wheelchair. The Marine uses canes to walk with them. He's hoping to get to the point where he can use one cane regularly, and eventually lose the cane altogether. ""I can walk without canes, but it's not real pretty,"" he said. This new generation of prosthetic technology was originally conceived to help amputees who had lost only one leg. But it's working for Bleill and Army Lt.Col. Gregory Gadson, who is also using the Bluetooth devices in his legs. What they are experiencing will help future amputees. ""We are the first ever to try this, so it's learning day-to-day. The [prosthetics] company comes down on a regular basis and checks in with us,"" Bleill said. Gadson, a former linebacker at West Point, said they are breaking new ground for amputees. ""I think we are kind of pioneering and hopefully blazing a trail for others to try the technology also,"" he said. But the technology is not without some problems. ""It's only going to react to how I move,"" Bleill said. ""Unfortunately, sometimes I don't know those reactions, I don't know what I'm doing to make it react. So sometimes the leg kicks harder than I want it to, or farther, and then I start perpetuating, and I start moving faster than I really want to."" Aside from the Bluetooth technology, Bleill's legs have one other thing in common with a cell phone. They need to be charged overnight. Currently, there are no spare batteries available. What are his long-range plans? He just wants to make it back to his home state of Indiana and work for a charity or even help the NFL's Indianapolis Colts. ""They do a lot for the community,"" he said. He added he simply wants ""to give back."" ""To, you know, just carry on a normal life. Go home, see my girlfriend, see my family.""

"(CNN) -- With the people of Haiti hungry, desperate and frustrated nearly a week after a powerful earthquake, sporadic violence and looting are erupting in the badly damaged capital. CNN's Anderson Cooper witnessed a group of young men breaking into a supply store in the city's commercial district and taking away boxes of candles Monday afternoon. They were followed by several hundred others, including women who used sacks to carry away items. Two Haitian police officers and the store owner tried to barricade the property. Police fired shots into the air to try to disperse the crowd, according to Cooper. Fights broke out among looters. Cooper saw one man beaten until one of his arms bled. A boy collapsed onto the street in a pool of blood, Cooper said, describing the situation as ""a frenzy of looting."" Anderson Cooper in the midst of looting chaos . Reports of looting have escalated in the days since Tuesday's 7.0-magnitude earthquake leveled Port-au-Prince, leaving the capital in chaos as emergency aid workers and authorities scramble to help. ""People are actually stealing this, then will sell it later, and then they'll use that money for their families,"" Cooper reported. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he wanted to increase the U.N. peacekeeping force in Haiti with 1,500 additional police and 2,000 peacekepping troops to better respond to the quake's aftermath. Ban says he has submitted his request to the U.N. Security Council. The U.S. military considers the security situation ""stable,"" Rear Adm. Mike Rogers, director of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters Monday. Rogers said that means meant the United States can carry out operations -- including search and rescue, distribution of aid, moving people in and out of the capital and flying aircraft. Nothing suggests ""widespread disorder"" and panic, Rogers said, citing the well-publicized incidents of unrest as ""isolated events."" No official death toll has been declared, but estimates range from 100,000 to 150,000 in Port-au-Prince alone. The buildings have crumbled to rubble, leaving hundreds of thousands of homeless survivors roaming the streets. iReport: Looking for loved ones . About 3 million people -- one-third of Haiti's population -- were affected by the quake, the Red Cross said. About 10 million people most likely felt the shaking, the U.S. Geological Survey said. All of this has occurred in the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, where infrastructure is weak and many people were already living in poverty. In several sections of Port-au-Prince, people could be seen scavenging in the streets, pushing each other away to pick up whatever they could find in the collapsed homes. They rummaged through plastic bags lying amid mountains of debris. Other survivors clutched tightly to their finds as they walked through the streets. For business owners, the growing violence is troubling because there are fewer police officers on duty after the earthquake. Many officers are injured or dead. The police who are on duty are armed with automatic weapons, and they have fired shots in the air to scare off looters. Even before the earthquake, robberies and home invasions organized by gangs were frequent in Haiti, according to the U.S. Department of State's Overseas Security Advisory Council. Adding to Haiti's frustration is the difficulty in transporting critical aid and supplies to survivors. Shortly after the earthquake, international aid groups responded quickly, trying to get food and medical supplies into Haiti to prevent the situation from going from ""dire to absolutely catastrophic."" ""I think people need to understand that out in Port-au-Prince, it looks ... like Tokyo probably did after World War II. It's flat. It looks like atomic bomb went off. The streets are completely blocked,"" said Kenneth Merten, the U.S. ambassador to Haiti. He added, ""There are rescue efforts going on. It's just difficult to physically get there.""","Incidents of looting are becoming more widespread across Port-au-Prince .

"(CNN) -- A top United Nations official acknowledged Friday that the earthquake relief operation in Haiti was not progressing fast enough. ""You can't snap your fingers and make it happen just by magic,"" U.N. Emergency Relief Coordinator John Holmes said. But he promised, ""We will do it, slowly and surely."" In an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Holmes said, ""We have blockages at different points or bottlenecks of different points. The airport, coming in -- not as many planes as we'd like to get in there because of the landing blockages. It's happening, but it's happening not as fast as we would like."" Referring to the slow pace of aid deliveries, Holmes added, ""We've got to unload it, get it into warehouses, then get it into trucks, then get it to distribution points, and then start to distribute it."" ""There's a huge effort going in from huge numbers of countries and aid organizations, but it's not so visible on the ground because you can't quite get it there."" Get the latest developments in Haiti . Holmes said it was key to dig out survivors from ruined buildings as soon as possible. ""There are something like 27 search-and-rescue teams now either on the ground or on their way, and that's beginning to make a difference,"" he said. ""Of course, with every day that passes, we know that the chances of finding somebody alive diminish, but that effort must continue, and we must continue to try and look after the injured."" Impact Your World . New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, who was in Haiti just before the earthquake and served there in the mid-1990s, also emphasized the importance of saving the lives of people who are trapped and injured. ""I think there's still an opportunity even though it's almost 72 hours. I think that's got to be job number one,"" Kelly told Amanpour. As far as aid distribution is concerned, Kelly said it was essential to move supplies from the airport into Port-au-Prince as fast as possible. ""It's about five miles for the most part, but it's a tough five miles. The roads are not good. Perhaps the helicopters from the USS Carl Vinson are going to be used to do precisely that.""

"(CNN) -- Air accident investigators are to resume the search for the flight data recorders from an Air France airliner that mysteriously crashed off Brazil six months ago, according to media reports Sunday. Flight 447 went down in stormy weather in the Atlantic Ocean while flying from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, France in June. Investigators have not yet established the cause of the crash which killed all 228 passengers, and large parts of the plane -- including both flight recorders -- have never been found, despite an extensive search operation that included a French navy submarine. Jean-Paul Troadec, director of the Investigation and Analysis Bureau, told reporters that a new search, approximately 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) off Brazil's northeast coast, will begin in February, according to Agence France-Presse. The new underwater sweeps will last a maximum three months and involve sonar and robot submarines, he said. Troadec was in Rio de Janeiro to speak to the relatives of the 58 Brazilians who were on board, AFP said. ""We tried to convince the families that we are conducting the investigation with the full intention of getting to the truth,"" he said. Troadec added that an upcoming report about the fatal crash contained ""no surprises"" but did set out ""new details, notably in terms of safety recommendations."" Tests have already brought into question the performance of pitot tubes, which are used to measure the pressure exerted on the plane as it flies through the air, and are part of a system used to determine air speed. Flight 447 sent out 24 automated error messages before it crashed that suggested the plane may have been flying too fast or too slow through the thunderstorms, officials have said. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) issued a directive in late August requiring airlines to replace pitot tubes manufactured by Thales Avionics on Airbus A330s and A340s. It said airlines should replace them with other Thales tubes and those manufactured by Goodrich.","Flight 447 went down in the Atlantic Ocean on June 1, killing 228 people .

"(CNN) -- One of America's top World War II fighter pilots, an African-American who took on Nazis abroad and racism at home, was laid to rest Friday at Arlington National Cemetery. Retired Air Force Lt. Col. Lee A. Archer, one of the famed Tuskegee Airmen, died last month in New York at the age of 90. Archer, who once shot down three German fighters in the span of only a few minutes, went on to become a corporate executive and venture capitalist. His life came to be seen as an example of the potential of any individual, regardless of skin color or background, if given a fair opportunity. Lee Andrew Archer Jr. was born in 1919 in Yonkers, New York. An aviation enthusiast from childhood, he left New York University in 1941 to join the Army. Despite passing a pilot's test, he was assigned as a communications specialist in Camp Wheeler, Georgia. But several months later, after the United States declared war on the Axis powers, Archer was selected to join a training program for potential black pilots at Alabama's Tuskegee Army Air Field. Archer graduated first in the program in July 1943 and, after receiving his commission as a second lieutenant, was deployed to Italy as part of the 332nd Fighter Group. On October 12, 1944, while piloting a P-51 Mustang, Archer downed three Luftwaffe fighters in the sky over Nazi-occupied Hungary. He also was credited with shooting down a fighter over Germany earlier in the year. U.S. military officials could not confirm a fifth downing by Archer in summer 1944. If they had been able to do so, he would have become the only Tuskegee Airman to be officially designated as an ace. By the end of World War II, Archer had flown 169 combat missions, providing cover and escorting U.S. bombers in over 11 countries, according to the Air Force. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. Archer remained in the military through 1970, witnessing its desegregation during the Truman administration and serving in several capacities. Among other things, he became a diplomatic officer at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe and was chief of headquarters at the U.S. Air Force Southern Command in Panama. He received special citations for his service from Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson. After retiring from the military, Archer became an executive at General Foods and started Archer Asset Management, a venture capital firm. Archer's wife, Ina, died in 1996. He is survived by three sons.","Retired Air Force Lt. Col. Lee A. Archer died last month in New York .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- The head of a humanitarian aid group and a few of his colleagues survived 50 hours beneath the rubble of a hotel, with the help of a few things he keeps in his bag for his two young children. ""We had one Tootsie Pop and we did share that,"" said Rick Santos, president and CEO of IMA World Health. He also had a bit of gum. While the supplies helped, Santos said, ""I think we made it because we talked to each other, we helped each other, and we had this hope that we would be rescued at some point."" Two of his colleagues did not survive. Santos and five colleagues had been walking through the lobby of the Hotel Montana last Tuesday when he saw one of the chandeliers swing. ""And before it even made its way down, just everything crashed and collapsed on top of us,"" he told CNN's ""American Morning"" on Monday. ""Immediately we were looking around talking to each other, trying to see if everyone was OK. Unfortunately two of my colleagues were pinned down by rubble and were injured. So we did what we could to help ease their pain at that moment."" Santos had some over-the-counter pain medicine and gave it to them. I'm alive! Messages from Haiti . ""My biggest fear initially was that there wasn't going to be enough air for the six of us,"" he said. Then, when it became clear there was enough air, ""We started talking about what we need to do. And, you know, from the size of the earthquake, from what we heard and what we felt and how fast the building fell, we knew it was a big quake."" The next morning, they could hear sledgehammers pounding as rescuers were checking to see if there were survivors. The trapped group screamed and banged on the walls, and rescuers heard them. The rescuers asked how many there were; Santos answered eight -- six in his group, and two other men trapped in an elevator shaft. ""They said, 'Are you well?' And we said, 'No, we're hurt.' And that was it. Then it really wasn't until we were rescued, till 7 p.m. the next night, that actually somebody came. We heard nothing. In fact, the second night was really dark for us. I think we were just -- we were just shattered that nobody came back and said anything to us."" The group used their cell phones to illuminate the space. Santos said only one of his colleagues could move, and she looked for air spaces and light. ""Every time we might have heard a voice or something like a saw or something, we would scream and yell, but there was no response,"" Santos said. Then, on Thursday, came a voice. ""We all started to scream and shout at the top of our lungs. And we heard a voice come back to us saying, you know, 'Hello, we're here. We're going to rescue you.' "" It took four hours to get the group out. Rescuers had to cut through layers of concrete, pull the trapped people out by their feet and squeeze them through a hole in the concrete only about 2 feet wide. ""I'm just amazed that we actually survived,"" said Santos. He added that he is grieving for his two colleagues who died. While Santos is relieved to be reunited with his family in the United States, his thoughts are with the people of Haiti. The whole time he and the others were down there, Santos said, ""As much as we were praying for ourselves, we were also praying for the people of Haiti and of Port-au-Prince. Because we knew how bad this was going to be, just from the way the building fell, and the aftershocks, which were just tremendous."" IMA World Health provides health care services and supplies in poor countries including Haiti. ""It's going to take years, if not decades, to really, really help that country,"" he said.","Rick Santos and 5 colleagues were pinned under rubble by Tuesday quake .

"Washington (CNN) -- Alexander Haig, who managed the Nixon administration during the Watergate crisis and served a controversial stint as secretary of state under President Reagan, died on Saturday. He was 85. Haig died at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, after he was admitted there on January 28, spokesman Gary Stephenson said. ""He served his country well. For that he should be remembered,"" said William Bennett, who was secretary of education during the Reagan administration. ""He carried himself well. He carried himself with dignity and honor."" The White House issued a statement mourning Haig, saying he ""exemplified our finest warrior-diplomat tradition of those who dedicate their lives to public service."" A top official in the administrations of three presidents -- Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan -- Haig served as Nixon's chief of staff during the Watergate political crisis, a scandal that dogged the administration in the 1970s. ""There was a time during the Watergate crisis when President Nixon was nearly incapacitated,"" said political analyst and CNN contributor David Gergen, who worked with Haig during the Nixon and Reagan administrations. ""He had a hard time focusing, so obviously obsessed with the scandal and the gathering storms around him. I watched Al Haig keep the government moving. I thought it was a great act of statesmanship and service to the country."" Haig became secretary of state during the Reagan administration and drew controversy for his much-criticized remark on television after the president was shot and wounded by John Hinckley in March 1981. ""As of now, I am in control here in the White House,"" Haig said as Vice President George H.W. Bush was headed to Washington from Texas. Haig said he wasn't bypassing the rules; he was just trying to manage the crisis until the vice president arrived. However, he was highly criticized for his behavior, and many observers believe it doomed his political ambitions. Born December 2, 1924, in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia, Alexander Meigs Haig Jr. was raised by his mother after he lost his father at age 10. He attended the University of Notre Dame for two years before transferring to the U.S. Military Academy in 1944. After his graduation in 1947, he served in Japan and later served on Gen. Douglas MacArthur's staff in Japan during the Korean War. He also served in Vietnam, where he earned the distinguished service cross for heroism in combat. He also won the Purple Heart and Silver Star twice. Haig served as supreme allied commander of NATO forces in Europe for five years. There was an assassination attempt on him in Brussels in 1979 as he was being driven to NATO headquarters. A public official known for his loyalty, Haig had hawkish foreign policy views, and Gergen said he could be tough and ""combustible."" ""He was first and foremost a soldier,"" Gergen said. Haig was assistant to National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger in the Nixon White House and was involved in the Paris peace agreements that brought an end to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. He was long rumored to be Deep Throat, the Washington Post's inside source on the Watergate break-in and cover-up that eventually destroyed Nixon's presidency. W. Mark Felt, then a high-ranking FBI official, declared in 2005 that he was the source. ""Great tensions"" in the Reagan administration simmered over his stances, and Gergen said, ""There was a sense in the White House that he was grabbing too much power. ""He wanted to be the, quote, vicar of foreign policy, and there was a lot of pushback from the White House on that. He felt that he had been guaranteed by Ronald Reagan a role as a strong secretary of state and the reins of power would be in his hands. He resented the White House staff trying to manage him,"" Gergen said. ""My own sense is that he has been underappreciated,"" he said. TIME: Read why Haig left the Reagan White House . As secretary of state, Haig tried shuttle diplomacy to head off war between Britain and Argentina over the Falkland Islands in 1982, but he failed. He opposed Reagan's handling of Iran and disagreed with the president's plan on aid to the contra rebels in Nicaragua. He eventually left the Reagan administration after 18 months and made a run for president in 1988, pulling out before the New Hampshire primary. He backed Bob Dole instead of George H.W. Bush when he dropped out. Former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. John Bolton announced Haig's death to the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington on Saturday and called him a patriot.","Haig worked under Presidents Nixon, Ford, Reagan .

"(CNN) -- Minutes after Bill Clinton's doctor divulged that the former president underwent a stenting procedure to restore blood flow through a coronary artery, CNN's Larry King made a similar announcement. ""A month ago, maybe five weeks ago, I had the same procedure at Cedar-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles that Bill Clinton had today,"" the 76-year-old talk show host told viewers of his program, ""Larry King Live."" King noted that he suffered a heart attack in February 1987 and underwent a quintuple bypass five months later. He described his experience with heart disease in his 1989 book, ""Mr. King, You're Having a Heart Attack."" Recently, he said Thursday, he began feeling symptoms that turned out to have been related to his heart. ""I felt some strange feelings in my shoulder, where I had the original heart attack,"" said King. He said he went to the hospital and underwent the procedure a few days later. Stents are tiny balloons that are threaded into a patient's heart vessels where they are inflated, pushing plaque against the vessel wall and increasing blood flow. ""I did it on a Monday morning, was out on Tuesday and back here on 'Larry King Live' on Tuesday night,"" King said. ""So I can report to the waiting public that I never felt better. They got it open, they put the stents in. I share a bond with the former president and I feel very good. I only didn't make it public because I just like to keep things private. But I feel terrific,"" he said.","King said he suffered a heart attack in 1987 and underwent a quintuple bypass months later .

"Washington (CNN) -- Coalition forces can attain ""success"" in Afghanistan, but U.S. officials should wait until December 2010 before they can measure the progress of the troop surge, a top U.S. commander told a Senate committee Wednesday. Gen. David Petraeus, head of U.S. Central Command, predicted the surge will be met by an increase in violence in spring 2010 and a rise in ""security incidents"" in the summer. Turmoil within the Afghan government over the 18 months of the troop increase is also expected as corruption is rooted out, Petraeus said. That, combined with an expected backlash in the spring and summer, Petraeus cautioned, means officials and the public should wait until December 2010 to evaluate the progress of the U.S. military strategy. ""While certainly different and in some ways tougher than Iraq, Afghanistan is no more hopeless than Iraq was when I took command there in February 2007,"" Petraeus told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ""Indeed the level of violence and number of violent civilian deaths in Iraq were vastly higher than we have seen in Afghanistan, but achieving progress in Afghanistan will be hard and the progress there likely will be slower in developing than progress was achieved in Iraq."" Petraeus' appearance before legislators was the latest by top U.S. officials on Capitol Hill this week. Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, testified before the Senate and House counterparts of the Armed Services Committee on Tuesday, joined by Karl Eikenberry, the U.S. ambassador in Kabul, who also testified Wednesday. Jacob Lew, deputy secretary of state for management and resources also testified Wednesday. McChrystal told CNN on Wednesday that U.S., Afghan and NATO forces need to cut off the Taliban insurgency from the Afghan people by establishing ""security zones"" that will gradually expand to encompass more and more territory. ""At the end of the day, the insurgency needs access to the population to be effective,"" McChrystal said in an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour. ""They need to be able to coerce the population, to tax the population, to recruit from the population, and to prevent the government from extending its governance into those areas."" If Taliban fighters are forced to keep their distance from the Afghan population, then ""over time, they become irrelevant, and they, in fact, are defeated,"" McChrystal said. The generals and diplomats were called to testify before the congressional committees about President Obama's new plan for the Afghan war, which involves the deployment of another 30,000 U.S. troops and a July 2011 date for the beginning of an American withdrawal. Part of stabilizing Afghanistan and fighting the Taliban will include supporting legitimate economies among Afghans, thwarting the chance that some would join the insurgency as a means of making a living, Eikenberry testified. About 80 percent of the Afghan people derive their income from agriculture and the United States plans to support agriculture among civilians while keeping farmers from growing heroin in the poppy fields, which can be lucrative for the Taliban, said Eikenberry. Also critical is a partnership with Pakistan, Eikenberry, Petraeus and Lew agreed. Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, articulated that fighting the insurgency in Afghanistan includes addressing the problem of militants who have sought shelter across the border in Pakistan. Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, who has been at large since the September 11 attacks in 2001, is widely believed to be hiding along the rugged border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. While the withdrawal is set to begin July 2011, Kerry said the United States will maintain ""engagement"" with the region and talks with Afghanistan's neighbor, Pakistan. And Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai on Tuesday said that the country will need help financing their own military and police forces for the next 10 to 15 years. Worried about billions of dollars in costs and the longevity of the commitment to Afghanistan, Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Indiana, asked Petraeus to explain whether 15 years would be necessary and how much money it could cost. If Afghanistan attained the ""aspirational"" goal of 400,000 army and police members, it could cost about $10 billion a year to support, Petraeus said. ""There's no question as President Karzai was highlighting yesterday that Afghanistan will require substantial international funding for years to come in a whole host of different areas, not the least of which is their security forces,"" Petraeus said. ""But I would submit that it is a lot cheaper to maintain a certain number of Afghan forces than it is to maintain the number of U.S. and coalition forces required to compensate for their absence.""","NEW: Gen.

"(CNN)  -- On June 17, 1964, President Lyndon Johnson explained to The New York Times reporter James ""Scotty"" Reston why he had to stay the course in Vietnam by stabilizing the South Vietnamese government so that it could fight communism. Johnson rejected calls for withdrawal that were being made by liberal Democrats as well as the proposal for neutralization promoted by France's Charles de Gaulle. ""So the only thing you've got left,"" Johnson said, ""is try to make this thing more efficient and more effective and hold as strong as you can and keep this government as stable as you can and try to improve it as you can and that we're doing day and night."" During his recent speech at West Point, President Obama rejected the lessons that these kinds of stories tell us about Afghanistan. The president, saying that the comparison with Vietnam relies on a ""false reading of history,"" pointed to three differences. The first is that the U.S. is now part of a broad international coalition. The second is that in Vietnam the U.S. faced a ""broad-based popular insurgency"" whereas today, according to most polls, a large number of Afghans support foreign assistance. Last, Obama added, is that today Americans are responding to a very real threat that began with the vicious attack on 9/11. Clearly, Obama feels defensive about this analogy and hopes to undercut liberal critics who are frustrated and disappointed with his decision. In trying to separate himself from the experience of Johnson, however, Obama did not give an accurate account of what many commentators have been saying recently, and he downplayed crucial aspects of the 1960s that do in fact offer warnings for today. Mark Twain once said that history does not repeat itself, but it rhymes. Most of those who have compared Afghanistan to Vietnam do not say that the situations were exactly the same politically or strategically. Nor is it inevitable that the surge in Afghanistan will be unsuccessful. The point of the comparison is that it is impossible to ignore the fact that Obama faces similar challenges, as did Johnson when the ""Americanization"" of Vietnam began in the spring of 1965. Both presidents entered the war despite the fact that many top advisers in the White House and in Congress were strongly warning against escalation. In 1964, Johnson heard from voices ranging from Idaho liberal Frank Church to Georgia hawk Richard Russell that Vietnam was not critical to fighting communism and that the war was unwinnable. Their warnings proved to be accurate. Going into this decision, Obama heard comparable criticism as well. Both presidents also expanded the war just as they were trying to shape a broad domestic agenda. Johnson was much further ahead of the game when he increased the number of ground troops in the war that he inherited. The war devastated Johnson's domestic efforts. Obama faces the same threat. Both wars have been justified as wars of necessity. With Vietnam, proponents warned that the fall of Southeast Asia to communism would vastly strengthen the Soviet Union and China. In an era when American schoolchildren were being taught to duck and cover under their desks in case of nuclear war, this warning about Vietnam also made the war seem essential. Today, the necessity stems from the claim that failure would resurrect the dangers we faced before 9/11. And both presidents escalated wars where the path to victory and the potential costs -- in terms of human capital and budgetary obligations -- were unclear. Despite the fact that Johnson confronted a very different kind of enemy, the risk today is enormously high. In Afghanistan, the U.S. is dealing with a war front that is notoriously treacherous, as the Soviets learned in the 1980s and the U.S. has learned since 2001. The U.S. is also depending on a highly corrupt and undependable government in Afghanistan. While the promise of withdrawal in July 2011 might be accurate, presidential assurances of benchmarks and end games historically don't come true. The one constant in warfare is that it is unpredictable and difficult to control. One day after Obama's speech, Defense Secretary Robert Gates indicated that the deadline was not firm. And the administration might very well be handcuffing itself to a strategy of more warfare as it keeps offering grave warnings about what a victory by the Taliban would mean. These warnings will make it difficult in the long run for the administration to contain the operation or to withdraw forces unless it is absolutely clear that the Taliban has been defeated. Democrats could find themselves feeling like their predecessors in the 1950s who were under political pressure to abide by the containment arguments outlined by President Harry Truman with the Truman Doctrine in 1947 -- first with Korea in 1950 and then with Vietnam. Obama should not be so defensive about the comparisons with Vietnam. Rather, he should use Johnson's experience to help guide him as he makes crucial decisions in the months ahead and attempts to navigate the challenges of the wartime presidency. In a conversation with a few of his closest advisers, Johnson said in 1964 that ""It's damned easy to get in a war but it's gonna be awfully hard to ever extricate yourself if you get in."" In 1965, Johnson made the mistake of excluding those who were trying to warn him about the dangers of the war. Let's hope that this time around Obama does not repeat this error. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Zelizer: Some Vietnam-Afghanistan comparisons have merit .

"(CNN) -- Heightening its warnings as anticipated anti-government protests approach, Iran's government says it will arrest protesters and hold them until April if they disrupt state-sanctioned marches to commemorate the overthrow of the Shah of Iran. Iran is this week celebrating the 31st anniversary of the Islamic Revolution, culminating on February 11 -- a day that marked the end of the country's Western-backed monarchy and the start of an Islamic republic. A coalition of Iranian reformist groups is urging opponents of the regime to stage non-violent protests on Thursday, on the official anniversary of the Shah's ouster. The so-called Green Movement has been protesting for social justice, freedom and democracy in demonstrations throughout the country since the disputed June president election. Those arrested for causing ""instability,"" disrupting public order and carrying ""extremist signs"" linked to the Green Movement will be jailed until at least April 9, the end of the Persian holiday, of Norooz, according to government-run Fars news agency. The holiday marks the start of spring. ""Given the security plans that the police have taken into consideration for tomorrow's glorious marches; these ceremonies will be held in complete security and calm,"" Fars quoted an unidentified, informed source as saying Wednesday. ""But if some try to misuse the vast participation and presence of the people; the police will deal with them firmly and resolutely."" Anti-government demonstrations began after the disputed June 12 presidential vote, which re-elected hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad over main opposition candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi. Police arrested 4,000 people in the post-election crackdown. At least seven people were killed and hundreds were arrested, witnesses said, as they took to the streets of December 27 during the Shiite Muslim holy period of Ashura. The Iranian government has denied that its security forces killed anyone and has blamed reformists for the violence. On Tuesday, an Iranian court sentenced one person to death and eight others to prison for their parts in anti-government demonstrations in December, the semi-official Fars news agency reported. The nine defendants were tried last week over their roles in protests during Ashura, Fars said, quoting the Tehran judiciary's public relations office. There are now 10 people sentenced to death and awaiting appeal in connection with the protests. Two men have been executed for participating in anti-government demonstrations, but a lawyer for one of them told CNN her client was already in jail when the protests broke out.","Protesters to be arrested and held until April if they disrupt state-sanctioned marches .

"(CNN) -- As Haitians struggle to recover from the devastation of Tuesday's 7.0-magnitude earthquake, mental health experts caution that the most severe psychological effects won't take form until individuals' situations stabilize. Feelings of confusion, fear, agitation, grief and anger that surround a large-scale traumatic event such as the Haiti earthquake give way to more pronounced psychological disorders once people's basic human needs are taken care of, experts say. ""Once the initial resources are in, when actually most people are going to start feel out of danger, is when the psychological aftereffects are going to hit people,"" said Dr. Daniella David, professor of clinical psychiatry at the University of Miami's Miller School of Medicine. ""People need to ask for help when that happens."" In the immediate short-term period after a large-scale traumatic event, people are concerned primarily with self-preservation and taking care of family and friends, said Dr. Sandro Galea, chair of the Department of Epidemiology at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. These people experience acute stress and anxiety, which is taken up by trying to fulfill the immediate physical needs. There is a normal and immediate stress response that comes with an event that causes damage to homes and infrastructure and loss of family members, David said. Haiti has the potential for higher rates of mental illness and a slower recovery after this episode because the population is already strained from weak social and economic supports, Galea said. In those conditions, they may already be predisposed to developing mental illness irrespective of the earthquake itself, he said. View or add to CNN's database of missing persons in Haiti . The stress of the disaster situation, combined with the potential predisposition toward stress disorders, could lead to an extreme emotional reaction, but that does not mean these factors predict any kind of violent or other extreme behavior, said Joan Cook, assistant professor of psychiatry at Yale University, in an e-mail. ""I'd say that if the rate of psychological problems turns out similar to previous severe natural disasters in other economically disadvantaged countries, as many as 50 percent or more could suffer in the short-term from clinically significant distress,"" she said. When disaster victims have information about their situation, they tend to make rational decisions and tend to the immediate needs of themselves and those close to them, Galea said. There is little evidence of widespread panic in those cases, he said, but there is a danger of misinformation. ""People can accept uncertainty, as long as they are brought into the uncertainty and told what central authorities do know, and also what central authorities don't know,"" he said. ""It's critically important that there is information that comes out centrally from a single source."" To assist at the early stage, the most important thing to do immediately after a disaster -- for example, at this moment in Haiti -- is to try to help with basic needs such as shelter and food, David said. In terms of psychological support, studies of natural disasters show that people should be moved to safety and informed that the immediate danger is over, something that has unfortunately been difficult to do in Haiti, she said. About a month after a disaster occurs, once the immediate physical needs are addressed, symptoms of mental illness begin to coalesce into specific conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, Galea said. PTSD in particular can last years after the event in a substantial portion of people, he said. The response varies. Some people may become fearful and develop panic attacks, while others experience sadness that turns into depression, and still others have an acute stress reaction that leads to PTSD or another stress disorder, David said. The high rates of mental illness in a population that has experienced a traumatic event go down over time, depending on how various problems in the area are resolved, Galea said. ""The extent to which we are able to assist people in rebuilding their lives becomes a tremendously important driver of whether or not the psychopathology that is caused by the trauma will go on to become severe, and how long it lasts,"" Galea said. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, researchers found that stressors such as not having a job, not having access to insurance and not being able to get paid contributed to the symptoms of mental illness, Galea said. ""Rebuilding lives, rebuilding social supports, rebuilding financial and practical supports will go a long way to minimizing the health consequences of the event that has passed,"" he said. Health.com: How will Haitians cope with psychological aftershocks? A population that has gone through something like an earthquake of this magnitude will typically have about 10 percent of people with PTSD and 10 percent with depression, based on studies of Hurricane Katrina, 9/11, and other events, he said. But among those who lose their homes and loved ones in an event like this, the rates can be more like 40 to 50 percent. The life expectancy in Haiti is just 61 years, according to the World Bank, well under the average life span of 78 years for an individual in the United States. About 56 percent of Haitians live on less than $1 per day, according to the World Bank. There is some research to suggest that fatalism -- feeling that you are powerless against life's external control -- is also related to long-term emotional consequences of disaster, Cook said. Studies by psychologist Fran Norris at Dartmouth University have shown that adult disaster survivors who feel uncared for by others or who lack the capacity to manage stress are also at risk for PTSD, Cook said. Recent events such as Hurricane Katrina have offered extraordinary insights into human response to natural disasters, experts said. Retired Army Lt. Gen. Russell Honoré, who led relief efforts for Hurricane Katrina, said Thursday that a lack of information ""created a lot of anxiety for people because they didn't know what was going on."" ""We need to correct that, and as soon as we can, start pushing information to people, because rumors can cause the victims to make bad decisions,"" he said.","After initial shock of tragedy wanes, other mental issues arise, experts say .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A California doctor has been accused of negligence in the case of a woman who gave birth to octuplets in January 2009, according to a complaint filed by the state medical board. Michael Kamrava, an obstetrician/gynecologist in Beverly Hills, is accused of gross negligence and repeated negligent acts in the treatment of a patient named in the complaint only by her initials, N.S. Octuplet mom Nadya Suleman has identified Kamrava as her doctor in interviews. Suleman has six children in addition to the octuplets -- all conceived through in-vitro fertilization. In filing the complaint in December, the medical board's executive director, Barbara Johnston, says Kamrava, while his patient was undergoing in-vitro, transferred a number of embryos that was ""far in excess of [American Society for Reproductive Medicine] recommendations and beyond the reasonable judgment of any treating physician."" The society recommends no more than two embryos for women under 35 years old and no more than five for women over 40, for whom it is harder to get pregnant, according to guidelines published on its Web site. Suleman was 33 when she gave birth to the octuplets. The reproductive society expelled Kamrava from the group in September. Additionally, the complaint says Kamrava should have referred his patient to a mental health physician after she repeatedly returned to him for additional in-vitro treatments shortly after each of her pregnancies. ""[Kamrava] failed to exercise appropriate judgment and question whether there would be harm to her living children and any future offspring should she continue to conceive,"" the complaint says. Efforts to reach Kamrava on Monday were unsuccessful. No hearing date has been set in the case.","California medical board files complaint against Dr. Michael Kamrava .

"(CNN)  -- Despite the rise of the Web and its freewheeling second-by-second ferment, government efforts at control and censorship remain rife across the Middle East and North Africa, a new report said Thursday. ""In the Middle East and North Africa, the Internet has offered many people access to information and the outside world that would have been unimaginable a few years ago,"" according to the International Press Institute's latest report: the IPI Press Review 2009 Focus on the Middle East and North Africa. ""However, government control of the media remains tight in almost all [Middle East and North Africa] countries, and censorship and self-censorship are prevalent throughout the region."" The Internet has emerged as a challenge to officialdom and its pronouncements and reaction from activists. Journalists say government efforts to stem the flow of information are futile. Communication on the popular social media sites, where people are attempting to elude the strictures of their governments, is playing a cat-and-mouse game with widespread independent reporting in places like Iran and Egypt. But, said Anthony Mills, managing editor of the World Press Freedom Review based in Vienna, Austria, ""Overall, things are getting worse."" In Iran, authorities cracked down on journalists after protests surfaced when President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared the winner in the June 12 presidential election, a victory that many in Iran say was fixed. ""Dozens of journalists have been detained without trial, and several sentenced to long prison sentences,"" the report said. ""As demonstrators took to the streets, a news blackout was imposed on the foreign media. And yet, through social media networks like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, news of a violent government crackdown seeped out."" With the rise of the Internet, censorship efforts have emerged in Iran and other places across the region. Iran ""also cracked down on online media following the disputed June elections, and arrested online activists in an effort to stop the spread of dissenting information and opinions,"" according to the report. Egypt, for example, uses a law designed to combat terror for arresting and detaining bloggers. But Abdul Rahman al-Rashed, general manager of the TV network Al-Arabiya, said the resistance to the flood of Internet information from government and other sectors of society is like trying to stop the Nile River from flowing. They can't halt it. ""A lot of information is getting through to the average person, in Cairo, in Jeddah and Dubai. Censorship will not stop the free flow of information, in my opinion,"" he said. Al-Rashed said the business needs of the telecommunications companies, the integral role the Internet plays in business, and the demand from citizens can't be thwarted. He said there might be remote regions where censorship can work because there isn't access to the Internet in such places. Octavia Nasr, CNN senior editor for the Middle East who monitors social media sites, said young people are boldly circumventing the official media censorship across the Middle East with Twitter, Facebook and alternatives. ""People are taking matters into their own hands,"" Nasr said. ""Traditional media is not necessarily a driving force."" Azza Matar, translator at the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information in Cairo, Egypt, said governments want the Arab world to use the Internet for fun and not interfere with government and serious issues, but people are circumventing the officials with new media. ""We're trying to express ourselves and expose the lies,"" she said. People from different countries prefer different kinds of new media, she said. As for Iranians, who are gearing up for a day of protests Thursday against the regime on the Islamic Revolution's anniversary, she said Iranians prefer Twitter because it can't be blocked and ""is faster than blogs in conveying messages for masses."" Neziha Rejiba, vice president of the Tunis-based Observatory for the Freedom of Press, Publishing and Creation and editor at Kalima Radio, said that theoretically, the whole world is getting its information online, but in the Middle East, censorship remains a reality, with cyberpolice blocking sites or even, as in the case of Syria, the Internet itself. There is a dynamic in the Middle East between censorship and self-censorship. ""When journalists sit down to write a piece, they have to keep in mind the reaction to what they're writing. They're either scared of sanctions or revenge."" Bahrain's Foreign Minister Khalid Al Khalifa said the Internet ""has revolutionized the world"" and ""has helped foster creativity, innovation and freedom."" There have been complaints there about the recent blocking of Web sites in Bahrain. While Al Khalifa said regulating different kinds of censorship internationally is impractical, he said in the Middle East, censorship takes forms he has mixed feelings about. ""Censorship can be taken too far to silence dissent and opposing views, but it can also be used as a tool to prevent potentially destructive and damaging ideas and behavior. There is increasing concern about harmful content on the Internet from violence, inciting racial hatred and terrorist activity, to sexual content and pornography, which justifies censorship on moral grounds,"" Al Khalifa said. As for other aspects of the Middle East and its media, the report reveals several relative silver linings when it comes to press freedom: the environment in Lebanon, Israel and the United Arab Emirates. Lebanon has a ""far and more diverse and vibrant media than any other Arab country,"" but the institute found that ""most of Lebanon's media outlets are unduly influenced in their journalism content by powerful political figures to whom they are financially and politically beholden."" Mills said the media in Lebanon can be characterized as ""partly free"" because there's a lot they don't talk about, such as criticism of military intelligence and the head of state, for example. According to the report, ""Israel has one of the most open media environments in the Middle East"" for Israeli journalists with a wide range of opinions and commentary. At the same time, Israeli security policy prevents Israeli journalists from traveling into the Palestinian territories without special permission, and Palestinian journalists are prevented from entering Israel. The report said both Israeli soldiers and Palestinian security forces interfere with the work of Palestinian journalists, and that journalists in Gaza have to resort to self-censorship. Freedom of speech and press in the United Arab Emirates gets ""some of the highest marks in the Arab world,"" but it ""still has a long way to go."" The report cited a ""number of taboo topics that journalists in the United Arab Emirates are not supposed to touch and indeed, most of the media do not,"" such as criticism of the ruling family. Across the Middle East, criticism of royal families and words perceived as insults to Islam have been criminalized. In Iraq, violence there has dropped and so has the number of journalists' deaths, but ""the U.S. military continues to imprison journalists without charge"" and local security forces have been responsible for beating journalists. There is concern about the rise of proposed legislation stifling media freedom. In Syria, which has ""one of the world's worst records on media freedom,"" the media outlets are owned or controlled by the government. Political unrest elsewhere, the report said, is accompanied by media crackdowns, such as in Yemen, where there has been an insurgency in the north and civil unrest in the south. Elections in Algeria and Tunisia have also led to press freedom violations. Governments have controlled ""moral content"" as well, the report said. ""In Saudi Arabia, several people involved in the production of a television show about sexual attitudes were sentenced to flogging and jail terms. In Sudan, journalist Lubna Hussein was sentenced to a flogging for wearing trousers. Following international uproar, the punishment was reduced to a fine, which was then paid by a pro-government journalists' association.""","International Press Institute's latest report notes rise of Web as news tool .

"(CNN) -- The case of a 13-year-old Arizona girl strip-searched by school officials looking for ibuprofen pain-reliever will be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court this week. The Supreme Court has a mixed record when it comes to students' rights. The justices in January accepted the Safford school district case for review, and will decide whether a campus setting gives school administrators greater discretion to control students suspected of illegal activity than police are allowed in cases involving adults in general public spaces. The case is centered around Savana Redding, now 19, who in 2003 was an eighth-grade honors student at Safford Middle School, about 127 miles from Tucson, Arizona. Redding was strip-searched by school officials after a fellow student accused her of providing prescription-strength ibuprofen pills. The school has a zero-tolerance policy for all prescription and over-the-counter medication, including the ibuprofen, without prior written permission. ""In this case, the United States Supreme Court will decide how easy it is for school officials to strip search your child,"" Adam Wolf, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union who is representing Redding, told CNN Radio on Sunday. Wolf told CNN Radio his client was traumatized by the search. ""School officials undoubtedly have difficult jobs, but sometimes they overreact -- and this was just a clear overreaction,"" he said. Redding was pulled from class by a male vice principal, escorted to an office, where she denied the accusations. A search of Redding's backpack found nothing. Then, although she never had prior disciplinary problems, a strip search was conducted with the help of a school nurse and Wilson's assistant, both females. According to court records, she was ordered to strip to her underwear and her bra was pulled out. Again, no drugs were found. In an affidavit, Redding said, ""The strip search was the most humiliating experience I have ever had. I held my head down so that they could not see that I was about to cry."" At issue is whether school administrators are constitutionally barred from conducting searches of students investigated for possessing or dealing drugs that are banned on campus. A federal appeals court found the search ""traumatizing"" and illegal. Some parents say older children deserve the same constitutional rights as adults, but educators counter a school setting has always been treated differently by courts, and a ruling against them could jeopardize campus safety. While a federal magistrate and a three-panel appeals court found the search was reasonable, the full 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Redding last year. ""Common sense informs us,"" wrote the court, ""that directing a 13-year-old girl to remove her clothes, partially revealing her breasts and pelvic area, for allegedly possessing ibuprofen ... was excessively intrusive."" The court said the school went too far in its effort to create a drug- and crime-free classroom. ""The overzealousness of school administrators in efforts to protect students has the tragic impact of traumatizing those they claim to serve. And all this to find prescription-strength ibuprofen."" In its appeal to the Supreme Court, the school district said restrictions on conducting student searches would cast a ""roadblock to the kind of swift and effective response that is too often needed to protect the very safety of students, particularly from the threats posed by drugs and weapons."" School officials said the court was ""wholly uninformed about a disturbing new trend"" -- the abuse of over-the-counter medication by teenagers. The high court has a mixed record over the years on students' rights. In a famous 1969 ruling, the justices said students do not ""shed their constitutional rights ... at the schoolhouse gate."" But decisions in the 1980s gave administrators greater discretion, including one case that said officials need not be required to have a warrant to search a student's locker. Such a search was permitted if there were ""reasonable"" grounds for believing it would turn up evidence and when the search was not ""excessively intrusive."" Opinions in 1995 and 2001 allowed schools to conduct random drug testing of high school athletes, and those participating in other extracurricular activities. And in a well-publicized 2007 ruling from Alaska, the Supreme Court upheld the suspension of a student who displayed a large ""Bong Hits 4 Jesus"" banner at an off-campus, but school-sponsored, event. The decision did not endorse a broader argument that students in general have limited free-speech rights when they interfere with a school's vaguely defined ""educational mission."" The court could now be asked to clarify the extent of student rights involving searches, and the discretion of officials regarding those they have responsibility over. The case is Safford United School District No. 1 v. Redding (08-479).","The justices in January accepted the Safford school district case for review .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Four militants armed with guns and grenades stormed a mosque in Rawalpindi frequented by military personnel, killing dozens of people Friday -- most of them children, the military said. The attack is the latest to shake the garrison city since this year's launch of strong military offensives against Taliban insurgents in the Swat Valley and South Waziristan. Rawalpindi is the headquarters of the Pakistani army. Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas said Friday's assault killed 36 people and wounded 75. Among the dead were 17 children, according to the military's Web site. Also killed were an army general and eight other military officials, six of them of senior rank. The remaining fatalities were adults. ""As soon as the mosque's security staff checked me, there was a blast and then a finger hit me, then there was another,"" Ishtiaq, a driver for a military officer, told GEO TV. Ishtiaq, who uses only one name, was attending midday prayers. Rawalpindi is near Islamabad, and the mosque is near national army headquarters. It is located inside a walled residential compound where many military families have homes. A witness told GEO TV there were up to 300 worshippers at the mosque at the time of the attack. The militants hurled grenades before opening fire, Rawalpindi Police Chief Aslam Tareen told CNN. He said all the militants died, but he doesn't know how. ""These are not militants,"" Abbas said. ""These are terrorists who killed innocent worshippers."" Retired Gen. Muhammad Yousaf was killed in the attack, said Col. Baseer Haider, a military spokesman. He said Yousaf was a former vice chief of army staff who was second in command during the administration of President Pervez Musharraf. Abbas said two of the attackers were suicide bombers who blew themselves up inside the Parade Lane mosque; the other two were shot and killed by security forces outside the mosque. Several explosions were heard inside the mosque around 1:30 p.m. (3:30 a.m. ET), followed by gunfire, Abbas said. The militants entered the compound by climbing over a wall, Tareen said. This is the first attack in Rawalpindi since a suicide bomber targeted a bank on November 2. On October 10, militants stormed army headquarters in Rawalpindi, taking several people hostage before security forces killed them. CNN's Reza Sayah contributed to this report.","Armed militants attack mosque during midday prayers in Rawalpindi, killing dozens .

"New York (CNN) -- A Somali suspect in the hijacking of the U.S.-flagged Maersk Alabama in the Indian Ocean last April has been charged with involvement in two additional hijackings, authorities said Tuesday. One of the hijacked vessels is still being held hostage, federal prosecutors said in announcing a 10-count indictment filed against Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse. The vessels are identified in court documents as ""Ship-1"" and ""Ship-2."" Under the indictment, Muse faces charges including piracy; seizing a ship by force; kidnapping and hostage taking, along with charges of possessing a machine gun in the commission of other offenses. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of life in prison. He was to be arraigned on the additional charges Tuesday afternoon in federal court, authorities said. Muse is accused of participating in the two hijackings before the Maersk Alabama was hijacked April 8, prosecutors said in a statement. Ship-1 was seized by pirates in March in the Indian Ocean, according to the indictment and a criminal complaint. Authorities say Muse and others ""known and unknown"" boarded the vessel while armed with guns, threatened its captain and took control, holding the ship's captain and crew hostage. While on the ship, prosecutors said, Muse aimed a gun at one of the hostages and threatened to kill him. He also showed a hostage what appeared to be an improvised explosive device, the statement said. ""Muse placed the IED in the vicinity of the hostage, and indicated that if the authorities came the IED would explode and the hostage would be killed."" In April, Muse and the others left Ship-1 on a small boat, called ""the skiff,"" prosecutors said. When the skiff returned, the ship and the skiff ""were made to rendezvous"" with another ship, Ship-2. ""The captain of Ship-1 was ordered to pull Ship-1 up to Ship-2. Ship-1 was then attached to Ship-2,"" according to the statement. ""Muse and others held hostage, on board Ship-2, both the captain and the crew of Ship-1 and the captain and crew of Ship-2."" On April 8, Muse and three others left Ship-2 and boarded the Maersk Alabama, the indictment said. Prosecutors allege the four fired shots at the Maersk Alabama before boarding it. The captain and crew of Ship-2 are still being held hostage, according to the documents. The indictment does not say what happened to Ship-1, its captain or crew. The Maersk Alabama was attacked about 350 miles off the Somali coast, authorities have previously said. Muse allegedly demanded that the ship be stopped, then he and others allegedly took a life boat and held the captain of the ship -- Capt. Richard Phillips -- hostage on it. The USS Bainbridge came to the assistance of the vessel, and in radio communications, Muse and the others threatened to kill Phillips if they were not guaranteed safe passage away from the scene, authorities have said. On April 12, Muse boarded the Bainbridge and demanded safe passage for himself and the others in exchange for Phillips' release, according to a criminal complaint. While he was away from the lifeboat, Navy SEALs shot and killed the three remaining pirates, authorities said. Muse was taken into custody. ""Piracy on the high seas is a threat against the community of nations,"" Preet Bharara, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in the statement Tuesday. ""Today's indictment alleges criminal conduct that extends beyond the attack against the captain and crew of the American-flagged Maersk Alabama. Modern-day pirates who wreak havoc off faraway coasts will be met with modern-day justice in the United States."" The investigation is continuing, Bharara said. A federal judge ruled in April that Muse could be tried as an adult. His father in Somalia told defense attorneys he was born November 20, 1993, meaning he would have been 15 at the time of the hijackings. However, the prosecution argued otherwise, saying Muse made statements suggesting he was older.","Alleged Somali pirate prosecuted in hijackings of two other ships .

Tony Gerdom, an emergency medical worker from Iowa, was driving off-duty on December 7 when the van in front of him suddenly swerved off the icy road and fell into a pond. The cold weather had frozen the locks and windows on the van, trapping driver Kathy Van Steenvik. Gerdom took a tire iron and smashed the van's passenger side window to free the driver. A second man, Brian Ford, held onto him with a rope while Gerdom descended into the pond. Each man shrugged off his hero label. ""I'm just the lucky idiot that jumped in first,"" Gerdom told CNN affiliate WHO in Des Moines, Iowa. ""No matter how cold the water was, it's this overwhelming feeling that I helped save a life. It's tremendous,"" Ford said. All three were treated at a hospital for minor hypothermia. Read the story at the WHO web site . Postman delivers CPR to save baby .

A Michigan father jumped through flames to save his two youngest sons when an electrical fire set their house ablaze December 7. Investigators told CNN affiliate WZZM in Grand Rapids, Michigan, that sparks from an electrical outlet set a living room curtain on fire. After climbing up pitch-black stairs to rescue his 4-year-old and 2-year-old boys, Jonathan Brito went back in the house and pulled out Punchy, the family's dog, who was unconscious. Brito performed CPR and revived the dog, Brito's wife, Charlene Hernandez, told the station. ""He got the dog to breathe,"" she said. ""[Punchy] coughed up some smoke and took off running."" Brito and Hernandez's other two children were at school when the fire started. The couple, who both work night-shift jobs, lost their clothes, furniture and some Christmas presents. ""Thank goodness everybody got out of the house safely,"" Brito said. ""If I've got to jump through fire to save my kids' lives, that's what I'm going to do."" Read the story at the WZZM web site . Men honored for saving driver from tanker fire . Truck driver Ronald Tobias, 73, of Syracuse, Indiana, was trapped after his propane tanker truck flipped on its side and exploded. But rather than running from the flames, two people headed toward them. Lonnie Hood, 30, from Acton, Indiana, and Robert Skaggs, 49, from Fortville, Indiana, each decided they had to try to help save Tobias on October 22. Hood was working on a nearby construction job and ran over. Skaggs was in his car on Interstate 465 when he saw flames behind him, stopped, and put his car in reverse. ""I just jumped off [a second-story roof] and ran to it. I don't know, I was kind of feeling something telling me to get over there,"" Hood told CNN affiliate WRTV of Indianapolis. ""I just kicked [the window] real hard and it went right in, and I just grabbed him up, me and another guy, and pulled him up to higher ground."" Added Skaggs, ""For some reason, I just jerked the car off to the side, threw it in reverse and took off backwards toward it."" For their actions, they were awarded the Governor's Heroism Award by Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels. Read the story at the WRTV web site . Bomb suspect hailed for railroad track rescue . Michael Woodson had already made news in Brevard County, Florida, as a bombing suspect when he rushed to help a man about to be run over by a train in April. Woodson, 21, had been accused of filling a liquor bottle with black powder and setting it off at Brevard Community College to get out of class. But in April he saved Michael Chergosky, 75, who was trying to cross railroad tracks in a motorized scooter. Chergosky's scooter had become stuck in gravel, and Woodson ran over to pull the man to safety as a train approached, reported CNN affiliate WFTV in Orlando, Florida. ""As soon as I got to him I grabbed him out by the back of his collar, pulled him out of his wheelchair. [The train] missed him by four or five inches,"" Woodson told the station. Several witnesses saw the rescue, and police said there's no doubt Woodson saved Chergosky, the station reported. Read more about the rescue at the WFTV web site . The station reported later that Woodson was sentenced to probation, 15 weekends of work at a sheriff's work farm and banned from the school in a plea deal. The heroic deed was not mentioned in court, the station said. Woodson said he never intended for the device to blow up, that it was just supposed to let off some smoke. The judge, who could have sentenced him to 15 years in prison, told Woodson he was lucky no one was injured. ""I hope that each and every day when you are standing out there in the sun you contemplate where your life could have gone if something else had happened,"" the judge said.

"Caracas, Venezuela (CNN) -- Residents of the Venezuelan capital on Monday began to experience water rationing as part of a government preservation measure during a drought. The rolling cuts to water service will affect the capital of Caracas and some nearby areas for periods of up to 48 hours, the state-owned water utility Hidrocapital announced. The rationing will continue through the first quarter of 2010, the government said. President Hugo Chavez has urged citizens to take extra steps to reduce water use, including a suggestion last week that taking a shower should take only three minutes. The government says that weather phenomena are behind the drought, while critics of Chavez say that years of lack of infrastructure investment and planning left the country flat-footed when it came to offsetting the drought. Drought conditions have reduced reservoir volume to critical levels, officials say. The level of the Camatagua Reservoir, which supplies Caracas with about half of its water, has been on a downward trend since 2007, according to data from Hidrocapital. However, it's not as low as during the early 2000s. Some water-rationing measures were taken at the time, too, according to Hidrocapital. In Miranda State, which sits adjacent the capital, the Lagartijo Reservoir is at the lowest level ever recorded. ""There will be programmed interruptions in service, with the goal of recuperating the levels of the principal reservoirs that flow to the city and that were affected by the scarce rains this year,"" Hidrocapital President Alejandro Hitcher said at a news conference announcing the rationing. Even schools will have to deal with the water shortages, the government said. Only hospitals will be equipped with water around the clock. Critics, including the municipal agency that distributes Hidrocapital's water to the city, say that poor infrastructure has made it difficult for water pressure to reach some of the poorest parts of the city, according to local reports. The government says that the El Nino phenomenon -- unusually warm waters in the equatorial Pacific that affects weather around the globe -- is behind the dry conditions. Venezuela's National Institute of Meteorology and Hydrology also pointed a finger at something called quasi-biennial oscillation, which affects winds in the stratosphere. ""This other phenomenon,"" the institute said in a statement, ""has a relationship with the rains, and is capable of modifying or changing the magnitude and impacts of the effects that El Nino has brought."" Journalist Maria Carolina Gonzalez contributed to this report for CNN.","Rolling cuts to water service will affect Caracas, nearby areas for up to 48 hours .

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- Air traffic controllers in Lebanon were telling the pilot of an Ethiopian Airlines flight to change course shortly before it crashed into the sea, the country's transportation minister told CNN Tuesday. An international search team was combing Lebanon's Mediterranean coastline for signs of life Tuesday amid fears that all 90 people aboard the Addis Ababa-bound airliner perished in the accident, authorities said. Lebanese Transportation Minister Ghazi al-Aridi said Tuesday it was too early to determine whether pilot error had caused the crash. He said the plane's flight data and cockpit voice recorders would need to be recovered to determine why Flight 409 disappeared from radar screens shortly after taking off from Beirut's Rafik Hariri International Airport at about 2:30 a.m. local time. The control tower lost contact with the plane before it made a course correction Monday, al-Aridi said. In a statement, Ethiopian Airlines said the pilot of the flight had more than 20 years of experience flying various aircraft with the airline's network. The plane had been declared safe and fit to fly following a regular maintenance service on December 25, 2009, the airline said. The Lebanese military reported Tuesday that 14 bodies had been found -- nine fewer than an earlier count. Confusion early in the search led to double-counting, they said. No survivors have been found. The search included aircraft from the United States, Britain, France and Cyprus. The U.S. military sent the USS Ramage -- a guided missile destroyer -- and Navy P-3 aircraft in response to Lebanese requests for assistance, according to U.S. defense officials. ""We don't believe that there is any indication for sabotage or foul play,"" Lebanese President Michel Suleiman said Monday. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board is also sending an investigator because the plane was made by a U.S. manufacturer. The Boeing 737-800 had eight crew members and 82 passengers -- 51 Lebanese nationals, 23 Ethiopians, two Britons and citizens from Canada, Iraq, Russia, Syria, Turkey and France -- when it went down, the airline said. The plane crashed about 3.5 kilometers (2 miles) west of the town of Na'ameh which is 15 kilometers (9 miles) south of Beirut. Government-owned Ethiopian Airlines is one of the largest carriers in Africa, serving Europe and three other continents. The airline has experienced two fatal crashes since 1980. In November 1996, a flight bound for Ivory Coast was hijacked by three men who demanded that the pilot fly to Australia. The pilot crashed while attempting an emergency landing near the Comoros Islands off Africa. About 130 of the 172 people aboard died, according to published reports. And in September 1988, a flight struck a flock of birds during takeoff. During the crash landing that followed, 31 of the 105 people aboard died. CNN's Nada Husseini and Cal Perry contributed to this report.","Search teams comb Lebanese coast following Ethiopian Airlines plane crash .

"Rome, Italy (CNN)  -- The Vatican did not know about an American priest believed to have molested up to 200 boys until 20 years after civil authorities investigated and then dropped the case, its top spokesman said Thursday. Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi issued the statement in response to a New York Times story alleging that top Vatican officials, including the future Pope Benedict XVI, failed to discipline or defrock the now-deceased Rev. Lawrence C. Murphy of Wisconsin, despite warnings from several American bishops. But Jeff Anderson, a lawyer who obtained the internal church paperwork the newspaper based its story on, said it ""shows a direct line from the victims through the bishops and directly to the man who is now pope."" Lombardi rejected the accusation. ""During the mid-1970s, some of Father Murphy's victims reported his abuse to civil authorities, who investigated him at that time,"" Lombardi said. ""However, according to news reports, that investigation was dropped."" The Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the office led by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who would later become pope, ""was not informed of the matter until some 20 years later,"" Lombardi said. The office is in charge of deciding whether accused priests should be given canonical trials and defrocked. ""The case of Lawrence Murphy has been well-documented since the mid-1970s, when allegations were first reported to civil authorities, although criminal charges were not filed,"" the Archdiocese of Milwaukee said in a statement Thursday. ""Murphy's actions were criminal, and we sincerely apologize to those who have been harmed. The Archdiocese of Milwaukee continues to reach out to victims-survivors who were harmed by Lawrence Murphy and encourages them to report any abuse they suffered."" Anderson, a lawyer representing five men who are suing the archdiocese, obtained correspondence from Milwaukee to Ratzinger as part of the lawsuit, along with other internal church documents related to the case. The documents, dating to 1974, include letters between bishops and the Vatican, victims' affidavits, the handwritten notes of an expert on sexual disorders who interviewed Murphy and minutes of a final Vatican meeting on the case. Murphy began as a teacher for St. John's School for the Deaf in St. Francis, Wisconsin, in 1950, and was promoted to run the school in 1963 in spite of the fact that students had warned church officials of molestation, according to the documents, which CNN has seen. Many of Murphy's victims were hearing-impaired. Ratzinger failed to respond to two letters about the case in 1996 from Milwaukee's then-archbishop, Rembert G. Weakland. After eight months, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, who at the time was second in command of the doctrinal office and now is the Vatican's secretary of state, told Wisconsin bishops to begin a secret canonical trial, the documents show. Lombardi said that church rules did not mean a priest would automatically be punished but that punishment, if warranted, could include being defrocked. ""In such cases, the Code of Canon Law does not envision automatic penalties but recommends that a judgment be made not excluding even the greatest ecclesiastical penalty of dismissal from the clerical state,"" he said. ""In light of the facts that Father Murphy was elderly and in very poor health, and that he was living in seclusion and no allegations of abuse had been reported in over 20 years, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith suggested that the Archbishop of Milwaukee give consideration to addressing the situation by, for example, restricting Father Murphy's public ministry and requiring that Father Murphy accept full responsibility for the gravity of his acts,"" the statement said, noting that Murphy died four months later. Three successive archbishops in Wisconsin were told of the abuse, but none reported it to criminal or civil authorities, according to Anderson, the lawyer. Lombardi, however, said that neither canon law nor Vatican norms prohibit the reporting of such cases to law enforcement. But ""he did not address why that had never happened in this case,"" the Times said. The Archdiocese of Milwaukee said abuse was reported in fall 1973 to Milwaukee police, who turned the report over to St. Francis police, but no charges were filed. Murphy was removed in May 1974 as director of the St. John's School for the Deaf but remained as fundraiser and alumni director until summer 1974, when he was removed from any role at the school, according to a chronology posted on the archdiocese Web site. In August 1974, a series of newspaper articles in the Milwaukee Sentinel reported on Murphy's removal and the allegations, the chronology said. In September, he relocated to a family home in the Diocese of Superior. A district attorney reviewed the allegations against Murphy in fall 1974, according to the archdiocese. A civil lawsuit was filed in 1975 against the archdiocese relating to Murphy but was resolved the following year, the chronology said. Murphy's request for retirement was accepted in January 1993, but restrictions against him were reinstated that year and reinforced twice. The bishops warned the Vatican, according to the newspaper, that failure to act on the matter could result in embarrassment to the Church. ""The tragic case of Father Lawrence Murphy, a priest of the Archdiocese of Milwaukee, involved particularly vulnerable victims who suffered terribly,"" Lombardi said in the statement. ""By sexually abusing children who were hearing-impaired, Father Murphy violated the law and, more importantly, the sacred trust that his victims had placed in him. ""In the late 1990s, after over two decades had passed since the abuse had been reported to diocesan officials and the police, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith was presented for the first time with the question of how to treat the Murphy case canonically,"" the statement said. At the time, there was no procedure in place for reporting church abuse to the doctrinal office, according to Vatican sources. The office was informed of the matter, Lombardi said, because it involved abuse at confession, which is a violation of the Sacrament of Penance. St. John's School for the Deaf closed in 1983, the archdiocese said in its statement. ""Most importantly, today, no priest with any substantiated allegation of sexual abuse of a minor serves in public ministry in any way in the Archdiocese of Milwaukee."" CNN's Diana Magnay contributed to this report.","American priest believed to have molested up to 200 boys .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court declined to intervene Monday in a dispute over a public school's refusal to allow an instrument-only version of ""Ave Maria"" at a graduation ceremony. Officials feared the piece would be an endorsement of religion in that limited public forum. Without comment, the justices rejected the appeal of Kathryn Nurre, who was a high school senior in Everett, Washington, in 2006. By tradition, graduating members of the school's wind ensemble could choose a piece from their repertoire to play at the June ceremony. They chose an arrangement of Franz Biebl's well-known ""Ave Maria,"" which had been performed previously in choir recitals. School district officials said they feared complaints similar to those that followed the previous year's choir performance of a vocal piece that included references to God, heaven and angels. ""Ave Maria"" was banned even though the performance would have contained no lyrics. The school district told principals to approve only musical selections that were ""purely secular in nature."" Nurre and others sued, saying their free speech rights were being violated, and said their choice of the piece was made on purely artistic, not religious, grounds. They also cited previous examples where a limited use of religious imagery in a public setting was considered acceptable. Such examples are Ten Commandments monuments in city parks and opening legislative sessions with a prayer. Justice Samuel Alito publicly dissented with the high court's rejection of the appeal. ""When a public school purports to allow students to express themselves, it must respect the students' free speech rights,"" he said. ""School administrators may not behave like puppet masters who create the illusion that students are engaging in personal expression when in fact the school administration is pulling the strings."" The high court declined to explore whether those attending a graduation ceremony constituted a ""captive audience"" that might feel forced to hear a religious message with which they may disagree. The case is Nurre v. Whitehead (09-671). In other Supreme Court action: . • The justices agreed to decide whether a district attorney's office can be held liable after a former death row inmate in Louisiana said prosecutors withheld key evidence leading to his conviction. At issue is a federal law that can place the burden on the state with a ""failure to train"" standard when one of its prosecutors unconstitutionally withholds exculpatory evidence from a criminal defendant. Then-New Orleans-area District Attorney Harry Connick Sr. claimed his office should not be held fully responsible after one of his staff attorneys violated long-standing, accepted procedures on handling evidence in criminal trials. The defendant, John Thompson, was freed from state prison after 18 years behind bars for the murder of a hotel executive. He came within weeks of execution before being granted a new trial. He was then acquitted in 2003 and won a $14 million judgment against the state. Oral arguments in the appeal will be heard in the fall. The case is Connick v. Thompson (09-571). • In another case, current and former Chinese Muslim detainees at the military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, lost another round at the high court. The justices are staying out of the latest dispute about the prisoners' demand of a 30-day notice before any proposed transfer from the detention center. The men, known as Uyghurs, wanted advance notice of which country they were being sent to, fearing they could be sent to a place where they would be tortured, imprisoned or harassed about their religious beliefs. The U.S. government, which says the prisoners are no longer considered ""enemy combatants"" or a national security threat, reiterated they would not be sent to places where they might face torture or continued imprisonment. Many of the Uyghurs released so far have been sent to the Pacific nation of Palau, with others going to Bermuda or Albania. The justices had previously agreed to hear the Uyghurs' broader constitutional claims over their years-long detention, but the case was tossed out as moot, since most of the men have been freed or are in the process of being freed. The case is Kiyemba v. Obama (09-581). • The justices also rejected a separate appeal of a Massachusetts law that keeps demonstrators away from abortion clinics. Anti-abortion activists said the restriction violates their rights of free speech and assembly. The law sets a ""protest-free zone"" of 35 feet outside clinic entrances, including driveways. Officials call it an acceptable balance between the right of access for patients and the right of expression for those opposed to the medical procedure. Some protesters said they have been forced onto streets to make their beliefs known and have nearly been hit by cars. That case is McMullen v. Coakley (09-592).","In 2006, school district disallowed instrument-only version of well-known song .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A group of Heath Ledger fans have taken their reverence for the late ""The Dark Knight"" star to a whole new level. Heath Ledger fans launched a petition calling for studios to remove the Joker from future Batman movies. Followers of the actor, who electrified audiences with his chilling reinvention of the Joker in the second Batman blockbuster, are calling for the character to be retired from the movies permanently. Ledger supporters at new Web site, The Ultimate Joker, launched a petition last week calling for studios to remove the Joker from any future Batman movies. The petition currently has 2,431 supporters. ""We think Heath deserves this honor,"" the site's team leader, Fer Barbella, told CNN from Buenos Aires, Argentina. ""He is the ultimate Joker. ""We are Batman fans from the comics and from the movies,"" he said, ""After we saw 'The Dark Knight,' we thought this Joker was really the best. It deserves to be withdrawn from any Batman sequels. ""When Michael Jordan retired, they withdrew the number 23 jersey as an honor. It's the same thing with Heath."" Barbella said he thinks any new performance just won't be able to top Ledger's. ""He upgraded the character in a thrilling way,"" he said. ""Although a lot of actors would love the chance to play the Joker, as Batman fans and now Heath Ledger fans, we think no one could ever perform it as well as he did."" The Web site is the brainchild of Barbella, 34; Nico Pimentel, 33; and Natalia Rodoni, 33, all advertising creatives in Buenos Aires. The trio say that if they collect enough names, they may go to the studio to present their petition. ""As soon as we start seeing that we have more than 50,000 names on our Web site, perhaps we will go to the Warner Brothers gate and do a bit of activism,"" Pimentel said. The huge buzz around Ledger's performance as the Joker last year stemmed from his update of the iconic character played by camp comedian Cesar Romero and as a hateful clown by Jack Nicholson. Ledger's Joker was a very different proposition from those that had come before: In a ripped, stained suit, with clown makeup smeared across a scarred, twisted mouth, his Joker was a nihilistic, sociopathic prankster. ""Why so serious?"" he sneered in a performance that received rave reviews from critics globally. Do you agree that Heath Ledger's Joker should be the last one ever? The actor was found dead after overdosing on prescription drugs at his apartment in New York on January 22, 2008, shortly after concluding work on ""The Dark Knight."" Ledger has been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of the Joker, having been awarded a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor and a BAFTA for Best Supporting Actor. Barbella says that the Web site and petition are their award: ""The Academy gives an Oscar,"" he said. ""This is a new award from the people. A user-generated award.""","Heath Ledger fans are calling for The Joker to be removed from future Batman films .

"Concepcion, Chile (CNN) -- There are days working for CNN when you feel like you are in the final scene of the film ""Hotel Rwanda,"" hurtling toward an uncertain salvation from a disaster of epic proportions. Fear and frustration are softened by exhaustion. Your heart races, but every other sound is like white noise. You plunge ahead, but also long to return to the comfort of your own life with its own particular frustrations and joys. That's how it felt pulling out of Concepcion, Chile, where an earthquake sent people gliding across the floors of their own homes, tossed some buildings into pieces and set off frantic unrest among people living without food, water or safety. We had been on an odyssey just to get to the epicenter of this disaster. We had left behind a documentary project on the Haiti disaster to fly to Miami, Florida, where we turned around and went through Panama; Lima, Peru; Sao Paolo, Brazil; and Buenos Aires and Bariloche, Argentina, before driving through Patagonia into Chile. But we couldn't stay long in Chile without jeopardizing that project. Full coverage of the Chilean earthquake . Even as this new disaster unfolds, there are still thousands living on Haiti's streets in a crisis of uncommon proportions. A documentary on Haiti's children needs to air while the public is still focused. Meanwhile, CNN was getting more teams on the ground to help those already here amid tough conditions. Our team of nine journalists and four drivers had arrived in Concepcion to join a few others, but we'd all been stymied by the lack of generators or fuel to power them in a place with no electricity. We had a mountain of snack food and water, but until we found ways to get electricity, each attempt at making television was a challenge. Then some of our local drivers confused the cans of extra diesel fuel and gasoline and filled the wrong fuel in the tanks. They spent half a day sucking it out of the vehicles, but then threw out the empty jugs we needed to get refills -- if fuel ever reappeared. It was a comedy of errors that ended up with three of four cars temporarily inoperable. It was cold with no place to stay, no way to power our cameras or equipment. The CNN logistics folks hustled, getting new people in with fresh supplies and gas. Our Haiti project was looming. We'd have to leave soon. But how? No fuel means no cars, and this whole region of Chile was at a standstill. The only thing moving was the earth, in constant aftershocks. And we were a 12-hour drive from Santiago, where the only big airport was closed. We hopped aboard one of the cars that still had fuel and headed to a small airport outside town. Concepcion, city of chaos . It wasn't easy: Whenever you leave a story, a reporter feels enormous guilt. After all, you'd come to tell people what's happening, to hold the authorities accountable, to record history in the making. This town was in crisis, and we were leaving. As we drove, dozens of people rode around on bicycles dangling fuel cans from one hand, aimlessly searching for ways to power cars and light homes. We dodged barricades put up by residents to discourage looters and around piles of bricks from homes newly damaged from aftershocks. The air smelt like smoke and concrete. Military vehicles and sirens made the only noise. We expected the tiny airport, which was officially closed, to be empty, but it was abuzz with the displaced. We were not the only ones hoping to leave. Hundreds of people carrying luggage had slept outside the darkened terminal hoping some aircraft would soon land and leave. The Chilean Air Force was offering rides, so we made our way to Santiago where the Peruvian president had a few police planes offering trips out of the disaster zone to Lima. We boarded the small airplane through the back ramp and saw that this aircraft was meant for cargo, not people. The gray metal ""seats"" ran along the sides of a curved plane that forced you to curve your back to sit. No big deal, we figured. It's just three hours. World's biggest quakes since 1900 . But on these planes it's not. They have small gas tanks and have to stop to refuel twice. It was cold -- bitter cold -- on the ""seats."" But everyone was so grateful no one whined, not even the eight or nine children wrapped in jackets much too big for them and tucked into their parents' arms. We, too, threw on more and more layers --mostly dirty clothes, as we'd been on the road for two weeks. We huddled together. Two hours in, the children onboard needed to pee in a plane with no bathrooms. Plastic bags appeared. There was no way to sit comfortably, and it was soon the middle of the night. The refueling happened in tiny mountain towns that looked like the surface of the moon. Each time we landed, we'd check e-mail on our quickly dying Blackberries. Another aftershock had hit, this time a strong 6.3. An e-mail went out from the main coordinating team in Chile, asking each reporting team to check in ASAP. Then, a tsunami warning. Finally, confirmation they are all OK. That was a relief, but word followed of another producer stranded someplace trying to find fuel and a generator to bring to our colleagues in Concepcion. How nerve-wracking. Then, word that someone has found a way to go help them. We pressed on. Everything on this trip evolved in 12-hour clips, and our trip was no different. We arrived in Lima at 4 a.m., cold and exhausted. Some women kissed the ground, crossed themselves or cried. Rose's family is at least from Lima, so it's a familiar place to one of us, but it's many hours from home -- and many miles from the last big story.","Soledad O'Brien and her team go from one earthquake zone to another .

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of people were evacuated Sunday amid flood concerns after a long-dormant volcano erupted beneath a glacier in south Iceland. It was the first time since 1821 that the volcano under the Eyjafjallajokull glacier has erupted. More than 600 people were evacuated as scientists monitored a fissure in the volcano from which lava was erupting. The fissure measured about 1,640 to 3,281 feet (500 to 1,000 meters). Despite the remote location of the eruption, if the fissure ""develops further towards the glacier, the melting floodwater ... will create dangerous floods in a populated area in south Iceland,"" said Gudrun Johannesdottir, a project manager for Iceland's Joint Rescue and Coordination Center. The country's civil protection agency did not immediately record any injuries or damage. Eyjafjallajokull is about 100 miles (160 kilometers) east of the capital, Reykjavik.","NEW: Scientists concerned eruption could melt part of glacier, flood populated areas .

"(CNET) -- Would you like to let AT&T know when your iPhone has dropped a call? Well, now there is an app for that. AT&T on Monday released a new application called ""Mark the Spot,"" which lets iPhone users submit complaints about dropped calls, poor service coverage, and less-than-perfect voice quality. The application is free and available in the iTunes App Store. It uses GPS technology in the iPhone 3G and the iPhone 3GS to pin point where the user is when experiencing the problems. For first generation iPhones, it uses cell tower-triangulation to get a fix on problem areas. Once the application is launched, users have several complaint options. They will see a screen that has buttons that let them report a dropped call, poor voice quality, or poor service coverage. AT&T spokesman Mark Siegel said AT&T plans to use the data collected to identify trends and prioritize the company's network investments. ""We think this is a great way to get customer feedback to improve our network,"" Siegel said. ""We are always looking for ways to make it easy for customers to share their experiences. And this app lets customers report issues. It logs the time and location and automatically forwards the information to our network planning team."" iPhone owners have been complaining about AT&T's network since the Apple iPhone went on sale in the summer of 2007. Complaints mounted after the 3G version of the phone was released a year later in 2008. And as more iPhone users come onto the network, more people, particularly in densely populated urban areas, such as New York City and San Francisco, have experienced problems with dropped calls and congested data networks. AT&T executives have not said that AT&T has a problem with its network. But executives, such as AT&T Chief Technology Officer John Donovan, have said that the company has seen a surge in data traffic attributed to iPhone users, who typically consume more wireless bandwidth than other AT&T wireless customers. AT&T has been upgrading its network to keep up with demand. But problems persist. And AT&T's network recently got a poor ranking in terms of customer satisfaction in a Consumer Reports survey. Verizon Wireless, AT&T's chief rival, has taken advantage of AT&T's struggles with a series of advertisements that point out AT&T's lack of 3G network coverage in certain parts of the country. Verizon is running advertisements that mock the Apple ""There's an app for that,"" catch phrase with one that says, ""There's a map for that."" AT&T fired back with a lawsuit and an advertisements of its own featuring actor Luke Wilson, who points out AT&T's strengths while taking a few shots at Verizon Wireless. AT&T recently dropped its lawsuit against Verizon. And Verizon, which had been suing AT&T over claims that it has the fastest 3G wireless network, also dropped its lawsuit against AT&T. Siegel said that the new ""Mark the Spot"" application was not prompted by the bad publicity around its network issues nor was it prompted by the current ad wars going on between AT&T and Verizon. Instead, he said that the application was simply a part of AT&T's ongoing commitment to listening to customers. ""We are always looking at ways to get customer feedback in as timely a manner as possible,"" he said. ""That's why we pay attention to Twitter, Facebook and blog. One of the great values of these social networking tools is that it's a great way to get instant feedback. And it helps us identify problems."" The ""Mark the Spot"" application can be downloaded onto all iPhones running version 3.0 or later of Apple's operating system or it can be access using iTunes and synchronized to the iPhone via a PC or Mac. Siegel said that AT&T is testing the ""Mark the Spot"" app for other devices. And he said AT&T hopes to offer applications on other smartphones in the future. No date has been announced yet. And Siegel didn't specify which devices might get the new application, but considering that AT&T sells a lot of Research in Motion's BlackBerry devices, it's likely it will create an application for that device. The app could be offered through AT&T's own application storefront or through RIM's BlackBerry App World. © 2010 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.

"(CNN) -- It has the curves of a Lamborghini, looks like something an astronaut might take into space and weighs only 10.3 ounces. Amazon's Kindle e-reader is wireless and can hold about 200 books, plus newspapers and magazines. Amazon.com's electronic Kindle reader -- a device meant to remove the paper from the page and make reading both more convenient and eco-friendly -- is celebrating its first birthday. Released in November 2007, the Kindle has sold more than a quarter million units. Its texts account for 10 percent of Amazon's book sales despite the fact that 200,000 titles -- a tiny fraction of the books offered on the site -- are available in digital form. While exact sales figures are hard to come by, recent estimates have put the Kindle's sales on par with other high-profile mobile devices in their first year. Amazon.com says that the Kindle is currently sold out due to heavy demand. So what has spurred its success? After all, electronic books have been around, in small numbers, for about a decade. Even Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and CEO, has admitted that the book is ""elegantly suited to its purpose. It's hard to improve on."" One thing that's helped the Kindle is marketing. Where other readers failed to connect with consumers, the Kindle has excelled. The media-savvy Bezos has hardly been publicity shy, gaining his electronic toy a level of exposure most CEOs couldn't begin to fathom. ""You can't discount the prominence of having Amazon behind this,"" says Paul Reynolds, technology editor at Consumer Reports. ""Jeff Bezos is respected for what he's done with Amazon, and if he feels this is a future product in media, people are willing to trust him."" Second, the gadget has been heralded by Oprah Winfrey, whose influence in the publishing world is immense. It's also been embraced by some prominent writers, including Nobel laureate Toni Morrison and best-selling thriller author James Patterson. Third, with more and more consumers accustomed to reading text on their cell phones and BlackBerrys, the world finally may be ready for an electronic version of a book. ""I checked it out on Amazon and thought it was an intriguing idea, a great way to have a lot of books that don't take up a lot of space,"" says Emily Branch of Florida, who was moved to buy a Kindle after seeing the hosts of ""The View"" chatting about it. ""I figured if I didn't like it I could return it within 30 days,"" Branch says. ""There wasn't a chance of that happening once I got it in my hands though."" One clutter-killing Kindle can hold about 200 books. And while other e-readers such as Sony's Reader must connect through a USB port to upload content, the Kindle is a wireless device, thanks to Whispernet, which is powered by Sprint's high-speed data network. ""I think the Whispernet is what sets the Kindle apart from all the other e-readers on the market,"" says Leslie Nicoll of Portland, Maine, who co-authored ""The Amazon Kindle F.A.Q."" book after her tech-loving teenage daughter urged her to get a Kindle. Like Branch, Nicoll says she likes the Kindle's low-impact effect on her bookshelves. ""I don't have to worry about giving it to someone else, reselling it on Amazon or finding a place to store it in my house,"" she says. ""For the enjoyment and convenience, it has given me in the past seven months, I consider that it has paid for itself already."" Readers can visit Amazon's online store and upload a new book right to their Kindle. Subscribers also can have electronic versions of The New York Times and other newspapers and magazines delivered automatically to their Kindles in time for reading with their morning cup of coffee. ""The large and tightly interacting collection of Kindle features, that go far beyond those of any other previous e-Book attempt, will cause the Kindle to be the first e-Book to succeed,"" wrote one reviewer on an Amazon discussion board. But not everything in Kindle world is roses and gumdrops. There's a difference between modest early success and making a centuries-old print format obsolete. The Kindle sells for $359, a steep price for the average reader in the current economic climate. ""I'm not going to pay $360 for that. I can get books for free,"" says Nikki Johnson, a college student in Atlanta, Georgia, speaking for traditionalists who are wary of giving up their bound paper volumes. ""There's nothing like reading a nice paperback,"" she says. ""There's nothing like holding or carrying a book, having that tangible quality and it being more than just a piece of data."" So in an unforgiving economy and in a stubbornly old-fashioned medium, will the Kindle ever expand from a tech novelty to a mainstream accessory? It might be too soon to tell. Blockbuster writers such as J.K. Rowling, author of the ""Harry Potter"" series, have said they'll never allow their books to appear on the market in electronic form. Yet future, better versions of e-readers may seduce younger consumers who grew up on PSPs and iPhones. A next-generation model of the Kindle is due in 2009. Early reports indicate the new device will be thinner and will have fixed some current design bugs, such as poorly placed buttons that cause readers to turn pages accidentally. ""I think it's certainly a ways away from hitting the mainstream ... because of the price and the experience a reader gets from long-form reading,"" says Reynolds of Consumer Reports. ""Whether these ... are successful, stand-alone devices remains to be seen. From what I've seen and heard, I think the technology is here to stay.""","Amazon.com's electronic Kindle reader celebrates its first birthday .

"(CNN)  -- Retired Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré was highly praised for his leadership of recovery efforts in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005, so he's well-versed in what works and what doesn't in disaster management. The general told CNN last week that the U.S. military should have responded sooner to the earthquake in Haiti because ""time is of the essence"" in helping quake survivors. CNN's Nicole Dow talked to Gen. Honoré Wednesday about his assessment of the situation in Haiti since he made those remarks. CNN: There are reports of looting in Haiti. Is it looting, or an attempt at survival? Gen. Russel Honoré: In the first days after a disaster, people are generally scavenging for food. They are trying to find food where they can. People are going into survival mode. Due to challenges and logistical issues, they use the food they have and what they can get their hands on. I would use the word ""looting"" lightly -- these people are surviving. It's reminiscent of what was seen during Katrina in the convention center. They survived because they found food in the surrounding areas. CNN: With the potential for violence running high, how can civilians protect themselves? Honoré: People should stay in their family groups and be with people they trust. During a disaster, in the case of not having enough communication, some of the information coming out is speculation and rumor. The role of the military is to provide a sense of order and try to keep people from becoming too excited when food and water are distributed. They also assure that help is on the way. What people are missing is information. You have someone sitting on a sidewalk with a baby, someone who is elderly, disabled, or pregnant, probably wondering what to do. Their house is in rubble, they have members of their family who need to go to the hospital or special care. Where can they go to be cared for? Or to help care for themselves in a humane manner? This is a humanitarian matter of global proportions. CNN: Previously, you've mentioned ""adapt and overcome."" How difficult is it to achieve this in Haiti? Honoré: You need the U.S. military. One airfield? Let's build two more. We adapt and overcome. USAID said, we have one airfield, how are we going to use it? They don't look at possibilities of building another one. Building another airfield is something that should have been considered the first day. You can take a road and create another airfield. We have a capability to airdrop teams in with equipment to create airfields. USAID said airdrops are unsafe, and it's disorderly to do airdrops. They were concerned that some would get food and others wouldn't. They started to drop five days after event -- the first drop of MREs (meals ready to eat). CNN: So why did the U.S. wait before starting to drop supplies? Honoré: If you don't have enough trucks, the optimal system is to use helicopters. But we don't have enough on the ground to get the job done. Ospreys, Marine planes, we have not seen them in use. There are some in Afghanistan, but not many there. They fly like a plane, land like a helicopter and can also carry a lot of cargo. They can lift things and set them down. We spent 20 years developing that aircraft. We don't have enough helicopters -- between the Coast Guard and the military, there are 60 helicopters in use now. Four days after Katrina, there were 200 helicopters flying in. I don't know if the flow of supplies can keep up with demand, unless we evacuate the injured, elderly, pregnant women, babies, and the disabled. Hospitals will be overflowing with people who have injuries, there will be infections that will need treatment. It is wishful thinking to add more hospitals. We need to think how these airplanes can leave with patients to the U.S. and other countries to be distributed to hospitals to stabilize them. I am hoping that the State Department and the White House will start pushing for a U.N. resolution to start an evacuation plan for Haiti. It will need billions of dollars to sustain its people and to start its recovery. CNN: How did the Israelis immediately set up a working hospital? Honoré: Our military is fully deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan. The president didn't sign mobilization of reserves until Sunday. We are making right decisions, but making them too slowly to have an immediate impact on the ground. We decided [Tuesday] to open another airfield, they should have done that days ago. CNN: You led the Joint Task Force for Hurricane Katrina. Can you draw some parallels between Katrina and the earthquake in Haiti? Honoré: In my book, ""Survival,"" there's a chapter that talks about dealing with the poor. I think sometimes we talk security, because as a culture, we are afraid of poor people in large groups. In Haiti, right after the earthquake, there were doctors who left. One said, ""We don't have any security so we left."" That, in and of itself, is indicative of my Katrina experience. People start talking security. And the slower we go, the more there's the possibility of that happening. We have to work on establishing the community government officials in Haiti so they can start communicating with their people. We have to get food and water there to local government officials to distribute it. The local government officials should be authorized to hire young men. The local economy will crank up if we pay people in Haiti to do the cleanup and to run the distribution centers. There's no need to send Americans there to distribute food and water when you have able-bodied people there who can do that. CNN: What are the top five points to keep in mind in the aftermath of natural disaster? Honoré: 1) Improve communications. 2) Get food and water in. 3) Take care of the health and needs of people. 4) Evacuate people, particularly those who are pregnant, disabled, injured, babies, those who cannot take care of themselves. 5) Establish who's in charge. The president of Haiti [Rene Preval] is in charge. It's different when the president and his government are victims. They are going to need help. Someone needs to be the face of the operation to help the president keep people alive. You must have communication to establish a way of giving information to the people in their communities. You have to be your own first responder in a disaster like Haiti, and the Haitian people did that. These situations have a tendency to get worse before getting better unless you start evacuating vulnerable people. Also, you have to take a risk [about security] during the search-and-rescue phase. In that phase of the operation, search-and-rescue takes priority over security.","Gen. Russel Honoré says Haitians should be paid to clean up, do distribution .

Spokeswoman Jean Becker said Bush, 83, was admitted to Methodist Hospital for testing after complaining of stomach pain for several days. She arrived at the emergency room at about 5:30 p.m. Central Time. After feeling ill, Bush called her husband, former President George H.W. Bush, at his office urging him to take her to the hospital. The former president's Secret Service detail drove them both to the hospital, Becker said. Jim McGrath, a spokesman for Bush's husband said all of the tests were negative. ""She's fine,"" McGrath said. Bush has been diagnosed with the thyroid condition Graves' Disease. It was not known whether the condition had any relation to her hospitalization on Tuesday. Bush, the mother of President George W. Bush, was first lady during her husband's term as president from January 1989 to January 1993. Born in New York in 1925, Bush, born Barbara Pierce, married her husband in 1945. She is the great-great-great niece of Franklin Pierce, who served as president from 1853 to 1857.

"London, England (CNN)  -- There are ""compelling reasons"" to believe the Israeli government was responsible for forging British passports used in a plot to kill a Hamas leader in the United Arab Emirates earlier this year, British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said Tuesday. ""Such misuse of British passports is intolerable,"" Miliband said, adding that the fact that Israel was an ally of the United Kingdom ""only adds insult to injury."" The passports were ""copied from genuine British passports"" in a ""highly sophisticated operation,"" indicating a government was behind it, Miliband told the House of Commons. Britain's Serious Organised Crime Agency concluded that the 12 British people whose passports were cloned where ""wholly innocent victims of identity theft,"" the foreign secretary said. The UK expelled an Israeli diplomat and changed the advice it gives its citizens about traveling to Israel as a result of the scandal, Miliband said. He did not name the diplomat or say what rank the envoy held. ""The UK had absolutely no advance knowledge of what happened in Dubai nor any involvement whatsoever in the killing"" of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, he said. Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman complained that the Israelis ""have not been given any evidence pointing to Israel's involvement in the affair."" ""We attribute great importance to our relations with Great Britain,"" he said. ""We maintain several different and sensitive dialogues with the UK, and we regret the British decision."" French authorities also have opened an investigation into the alleged use of forged documents, the Paris prosecutor's office said Tuesday. Suspects in the killing allegedly used four doctored French passports, the prosecutor said in a written statement. ""Further investigation has revealed that these four passports were actually false as the photos did not correspond to the names appearing in each document,"" the statement said. Al-Mabhouh, a founding member of Hamas' military wing, was found dead January 20 in his Dubai hotel room. Police believe he was killed the night before, allegedly by the secretive Israeli foreign intelligence unit Mossad. Two sources told CNN earlier this month that the number of identified suspects in al-Mabhouh's death was up to 27. Of them, 26 were carrying European or Australian passports, authorities have said. The sources -- an official familiar with the investigation and a police source -- did not say which nation issued the passport used by the 27th suspect. The 27 suspects are believed to have acquired false passports to travel to Dubai for the killing, then scattered to several far-flung locations afterward. But Lt. Gen. Dahi Khalfan Tamim, Dubai police chief, has said not all the suspects had fraudulent passports -- ""We know some of the names are real."" Interpol, the international police agency, has issued ""red notices"" to help search for the suspects. The notices are not international arrest warrants, but are a way of alerting police forces around the world that the suspects are wanted by United Arab Emirates authorities. Interpol expands search for suspects . Interpol Secretary-General Ronald K. Noble said investigators have established ""clear"" links through passport records, video surveillance, DNA analysis, witness interviews and hotel, credit card, phone and transport records, according to a statement. Police have said toxicology results show al-Mabhouh was injected with succinylcholine, a drug used to relax muscles during surgery or as an anesthetic, before he was suffocated. Signs indicated that al-Mabhouh resisted as he was being suffocated, police said. Al-Mabhouh's family members were told earlier that police had found blood on a pillow. Authorities have also said the killers left some of al-Mabhouh's medication next to him in an apparent effort to make the death appear natural. But ""the medication left next to him in the room has nothing to do with the killing,"" Tamim has said. Tamim told CNN last month that he is ""100 percent sure"" Mossad was responsible. ""The Mossad needs to be ashamed of its actions,"" he said. ""They sent 26, 27 persons to assassinate one man who was involved in the capturing and killing of two Israeli soldiers."" Dubai police: Mossad should be 'ashamed' Hamas has said al-Mabhouh was behind the 1989 deaths of the Israeli soldiers. Israel has a stated policy on security matters of neither confirming nor denying involvement. Lieberman, however, told Israel Army Radio earlier this month, ""There is certainly no reason to think that the Mossad and not some other intelligence agency of another country operated there."" The total of 27 suspects does not include two Palestinians arrested in Jordan and returned to Dubai. Tamim said one is not believed to be directly involved in al-Mabhouh's death, but ""he is wanted by one of the Palestinian factions in the Palestinian territories and he is sentenced to death and that's why we will extradite him."" He declined to discuss anything about the other Palestinian. CNN's Guy Azriel in Jerusalem and Niki Cook in Paris, France, contributed to this report.","Miliband: Passports copied in a ""highly sophisticated operation""

"(CNN) -- Jeff Kohnstamm had a bit of an unusual childhood. He grew up in a virtual museum. Even now when he wanders around the lobby at Oregon's iconic Timberline Lodge, Kohnstamm, 47, sometimes flashes back to being a kid on a tricycle, winding his way around original furniture designed by Depression-era artisans. For Kohnstamm, whose family has operated the federally owned property for a half century, the Mount Hood ski lodge has become a living scrapbook of his life. From birth until college he divided his days between school in neighboring Portland and Timberline -- with its rustic stone masonry, massive wooden beams, paintings, wood marquetry, custom wrought iron accoutrements and linoleum murals. ""There are museum aspects of this place, and I suppose the government could say, 'let's make it into a museum and have ropes and glass and charge admission,' but we'd rather it be a ski lodge than a museum."" Since its birth in the late 1930s as a New Deal project to create hundreds of jobs for Portland workers, craftsmen and artisans, Timberline has dug out its own place in American culture. But it also bills itself as America's only year-round ski area. 'Heeeeere's Johnny!' And, if the photos strike you as familiar, it may be because Timberline has built a respectable resume as a location for films such as ""Bend of the River,"" starring Jimmy Stewart, ""All the Young Men,"" starring Sydney Poitier and the horror classic ""The Shining"" with Jack Nicholson. In a way, you could say the Timberline played the starring role in that 1980 film. The lodge stood as the haunted Overlook Hotel, but only in exterior shots. All interior scenes were shot elsewhere, said Kohnstamm, who helped the film crew during the shoot. ""I did some work outside for the crew's helicopter shots,"" he said. ""We'd have to make sure that the place looked desolate and that no one was around. I remember hiding in the trees so they could get the shots."" Growing up at the lodge for Kohnstamm meant making fast friends with children of guests who vacationed there every year. It was the place where he enjoyed his first legal beer on his 21st birthday -- in the lodge's Ram's Head Bar with its breathtaking view of the Cascade Mountains. The site for hundreds of guests' weddings over the years, Timberline was where Kohnstamm's own younger brother chose to tie the knot. It was where his late father announced the Christmas Eve arrival of Santa and a pair of authentic reindeer for guests' wide-eyed children. ""I still kinda think it was really Santa Claus,"" he laughs. ""Why not?"" Night skiing . But as one might expect, so much about growing up at Timberline revolved around skiing. Kohnstamm learned to ski at age 3. Later, he says, to get them away from the TV, ""my mom would make us go out and ski for at least an hour before we could watch football."" ""At one point during adolescence we convinced Dad that it would be a good idea to ski all night long on New Year's,"" he said. ""It got kind of crazy for a while there. We had all these people skiing and sleeping and whatever all over the place."" Now listed on the National Register of Historic Places, Timberline came uncomfortably close to being destroyed before Kohnstamm's father began operating it in 1955. Four previous operators hadn't had much success running the lodge, and in 1953, the U.S. Forest Service thought of Timberline as more of a headache than anything else, Kohnstamm said. Options at the time included either burning it or dismantling it until Kohnstamm's father, R.L. Kohnstamm, entered the picture. The family's permit to operate Timberline expires in 2038. 'You've really got something big here' Local snowboarding entrepreneur John Ingersoll remembers R.L. Kohnstamm, who passed away in 2006, as a visionary. Ingersoll founded High Cascade Snowboard Camp in 1989, when most U.S. ski areas were shunning the relatively new sport. ""It was one of those memories that you'll never forget,"" Ingersoll said, remembering a day on a snowfield in the early 90s. ""R.L. stopped me and he looked me in the eye and made sure that I got it. He said snowboarding was going to be really big. 'You've really got something here, John,' he told me."" Today, Ingersoll says Mount Hood's snowboarding camps gross millions of dollars each year. Last summer High Cascade's 22-foot halfpipe hosted several U.S. Olympic team members, including 2010 gold medallist Shaun White. Although White stayed at Timberline during his visit last summer, many guests come with no intention of boarding or skiing or hiking, said Sarah Munro, author of ""Timberline Lodge: The History, Art, and Craft of an American Icon."" ""The artwork has made Timberline its own destination apart from the mountain,"" she said. ""It retains the feel of the 1930s -- that early period of auto-recreation and being in hotels with big lobbies when all the guests came together at dinner. It's sort of a living museum."" Strolling around the lodge offers guests one surprise after another: wooden stair post newels carved in the shape of bears, owls and other animals; wrought iron fireplace andirons forged from train rails; lamps, iron-fashioned door handles and specially designed seat cushions. The main lounge is dominated by an amazing three-story stone chimney with six fireplaces. ""Much of the building's massive beams are held together with unique joints and big wooden pins that lock the things together,"" said Gary Larsen, the U.S. Forest Service administrator. ""I've always enjoyed that and the interaction between the black wrought iron and the natural wood."" Old stimulus, new stimulus . Ironically, the New Deal project which cost about $1 million in 1937 is benefiting from $4.25 million in 2009 federal stimulus. Adjusted for inflation, $1 million in 1937 equals more than $15 million now, according to federal calculations. $4.25 million now, equals about $282,000 in 1937. The new stimulus funds are earmarked for painting, replacement of a water main and improvements for disabled guests, Kohnstamm said. It's unclear how many jobs will be created by the stimulus funds, but Kohnstamm guesses about a hundred jobs and ten different projects. ""The building is old and it faces huge environmental pressures being at that elevation in that kind of weather,"" said Jeff Jaqua, Timberline's newly retired archeologist with the U.S. Forest Service. ""Things like electrical wiring, plumbing, water lines, sewer lines -- unseen components of the lodge -- really need a lot of attention,' Jaqua said. ""The Forest Service is trying to address that."" Jaqua, Larsen, Munro, Ingersoll and Kohnstamm have written about their love for the hotel in an upcoming book ""Timberline Lodge: A Love Story -- Diamond Jubilee Edition,"" due out this fall. It wasn't until Jaqua began caring for Timberline's treasures 20 years ago that he really began to understand the bond that many guests form during their visits. ""Everybody owns it,"" he said. ""That was the big surprise to me. I didn't expect the general public to be so in love with it.""","Oregon's Timberline ski lodge, setting for ""The Shining,"" showcases  Depression-era art .

"(CNN) -- Three people died Thursday when a medical helicopter crashed in western Tennessee, the Federal Aviation Administration said. The helicopter had dropped off a patient in Jackson, Tennessee, and was returning to Brownsville, Tennessee, about 30 miles west of Jackson, when the crash was reported, said FAA spokesman Lynn Lunsford. Tennessee Emergency Management Agency spokesman Jeremy Heidt said the crash occurred shortly after 6 a.m. Three people were initially reported to be on board the helicopter, Lunsford said. All three were believed to be fatalities, as the aircraft -- a Eurocopter AS350 -- was burned, he said. Investigators were en route to the scene of the crash, a field near Brownsville, Lunsford said. CNN affiliate WMC-TV said the helicopter was operated by Hospital Wing. The organization identifies itself on its Web site as the Memphis Medical Center's air ambulance service. Hospital Wing said in a statement, reported by WMC-TV, that the crash occurred just east of Brownsville, and that three crew members and no patients were on board. The National Transportation Safety Board and the FAA are investigating, the statement said. ""Nothing like this has ever happened in our history,"" Allen Burnette, Hospital Wing's director and chief operating officer, said in the statement. ""A weather report said there were thunderstorms in the area, but that they had passed, Lunsford said. ""The big weather system moving through had stopped a few moments before."" Officials believe the helicopter was operating under a visual flight rules plan and not communicating with air traffic controllers, he said. Visual Flight Rules, or VFR, mean a flight is conducted under visual conditions. ""There are operating guidelines in any aviation operation, but ultimately the pilot is responsible for (the) safety of (the) aircraft and deciding whether to go forward or not,"" Lunsford said. Hospital Wing was founded in 1985, the group's statement said, and is a nonprofit air medical transport service with direct alliances with the Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare, Baptist Memorial Hospital, The MED, St. Francis Hospital in Memphis and Crittenden Memorial Hospital in West Memphis, Arkansas.

"(CNN) -- Schalke moved to within a point of German Bundesliga leaders Bayer Leverkusen after winning 2-0 away to fellow title hopefuls Werder Bremen on Saturday night. Kevin Kuranyi and Jan Moravek scored in the second half to put Schalke a point above third-placed Bayern Munich, who earlier crushed lowly Bochum 5-1 to cap a memorable week. Former Germany striker Kuranyi put Schalke ahead two minutes after halftime and midfielder Moravek ensured Bremen's first league defeat since the opening day of the season with his 72nd-minute goal. Bremen could also have closed to within a point of Leverkusen, who were held 2-2 at bottom club Hertha Berlin on Friday night, but ended the night two points adrift of Bayern. Louis Van Gaal's Bayern, runners-up to Wolfsburg last season, briefly reached their highest league position since he took over as coach in the summer as Mario Gomez continued his recent scoring run with the opening goal at Bochum and strike partner Ivica Olic netted twice. Bayern, who crushed Italian giants Juventus 4-1 in midweek to qualify for the knockout stages of the Champions League, moved to within two points of leaders Bayer Leverkusen, . Olic set up Gomez's 23rd-minute header for the opening goal, and Mergim Mavraj put through his own net 10 minutes later as the Germany international tried to repay the favor to the Croatian. Olic got on the scoresheet two minutes before halftime from Bastian Schweinsteiger's cross and made it 4-0 four minutes after the break with a header from Holger Badstuber's delivery. Danijel Pranjic extended the lead five minutes later after fullback Phillip Lahm surged into the box and squared the ball to him, while Christian Fuchs scored a consolation free-kick for Bochum in the 76th minute. Fifth-placed Hamburg joined Bremen on 28 points, winning 4-0 at Nuremberg to end a run of seven games without a win. All the goals came in the second half as Eljero Elia's 47th-minute strike opened the floodgates, and he helped set up Marcell Jansen for the second on the hour mark. Tunay Torun made it 3-0 six minutes later with a fierce rising effort after cutting in from the left, and Elia wrapped it up on 74 from Jansen's pass. Sixth-placed Hoffenheim failed to keep pace with the teams above them, drawing 1-1 at home to Eintracht Frankfurt, and have now won just once in five league outings. Sejad Salihovic opened the scoring for the hosts in the ninth minute with a penalty after Selim Teber fouled Vedad Ibisevic, but Pirmin Schwegler equalized for Frankfurt on 61 when his long-range effort hit Luis Gustavo and ballooned over goalkeeper Timo Hildebrand and into the net. Borussia Moenchengladbach triumphed 5-3 at home to Hannover, who conceded three own-goals and had a player sent off in an incredible mid-table clash. Defender Karim Haggui twice put into his own net -- the first an lucky rebound from goalkeeper Florian Fromlowitz's attempted clearance in the 15th minute to open the scoring, and he also contributed the game's eighth goal with his second faux-pas. Constant Djakpa also conceded at the wrong end to give the hosts a 3-1 lead in the 59th minute, while Hannover's Didier Ya Konen scored in each half before being dismissed for his second yellow card on 84. Cologne edged away from the relegation zone with a 0-0 draw at Freiburg as Germany international striker Lukas Podolski -- who has not scored in the Bundesliga since September 13 -- hit the woodwork twice for the visitors.","Schalke move to within a point of German Bundesliga leaders Bayer Leverkusen .

"(CNN) -- Police are seeking a pair of suspects in a Sunday church service shooting in Richmond, California, that left two teenagers injured, though authorities are still looking for a motive in what they say was a targeted operation. Police believe they have identified at least two of the three hooded men who entered New Gethsemane Church of God in Christ about 12:30 p.m. Sunday. Amid a congregation of about 100, one of them opened fire. ""We're hoping we can make an arrest sometime in the near future,"" Richmond police spokeswoman Sgt. Bisa French told CNN. Police are withholding the suspects' names. French said they're in their late teens or early 20s and live in Richmond, about 12 miles north of Oakland. Church officials say the two congregants injured on Sunday, age 14 and 19, are brothers. ""We're not sure if those two victims were targeted, but someone definitely in that general area where the victims were was targeted,"" French said. The victims are expected to make full recoveries, police said. Officials at the church said they are determined to continue operating as normal. Hours after the shooting, a Sunday Bible study was held as planned, with about 15 people attending. ""I'm sure there's some fear and shock, but we're not running,"" said Ezekiel Wallace, the church deacon. ""We are going to be doing what we always do: Pray and have church."" ""We're not scared, but we're sort of mystified because this is God's church,"" said Earl Young, a church member since 1967. ""We refuse to let the devil make us run and hide because that's probably what they want us to do.""

"(CNN) -- Higher temperatures are bringing some relief to the Southeast and should remain in place despite stormy weather expected for the coming weekend, weather forecasters said Tuesday. After the stretch of unusually cold weather that gripped the region, severe storms will affect the Gulf Coast of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and most of Florida on Friday evening and Saturday, the National Weather Service said. Cold Arctic air will remain to the north. In Atlanta, Georgia -- where ice from a snowfall last week remains on the ground in some places and weekend temperatures didn't climb out of the 20s -- forecasters predicted a daytime high of 37 degrees Tuesday after a high of 44 on Monday. A gradual warming is predicted through Friday, when the high could reach 58. But overnight lows aren't expected to edge above freezing until Friday night. Several Florida cities have had early morning record lows in the past two days, the weather service said. ""Temperatures over the weekend and early Monday morning plunged to levels not seen in 20 years over south Florida in the wake of the arctic cold front which blasted through the region early Saturday,"" it said. ""Temperatures remained at or below 50 degrees for more than 48 consecutive hours, finally rising above 50 during the late morning to midday hours Monday. Although no records are kept of consecutive number of hours at or below 50 degrees, it is likely that this streak is among the longest on record."" Key West, which has weather records dating to 1873, recorded its second-lowest temperature of 42 degrees Monday at 4:55 a.m. Its record low was 41 degrees, set January 13, 1981, and January 12, 1886. In northern Florida, Tuesday's high was expected to reach 54 degrees in the state capital, Tallahassee, and temperatures were forecast to increase during the week. Early morning readings Wednesday will be in the high 20s, the weather service said. That is far better than the low of 16 degrees in the city early Monday. The cold weather has damaged Florida's citrus crops, which can't tolerate prolonged temperatures of 28 degrees or below. Florida produces three-quarters of the United States' orange crop. Some groves in the northern part of the growing area suffered substantial frost damage Saturday night and Sunday morning, Andrew Meadows, spokesman for Florida Citrus Mutual, said Monday. It will take about five weeks to quantify the losses, he said. But the frigid air was welcome to peach growers in central Texas. According to Jamey Vogel, who owns Vogel Orchard in Stonewall, Texas, just east of Fredericksburg, ""Peach trees need chilling hours, which are hours below 45 degrees, and we have been getting a lot of those this year."" ""We absolutely welcome it,"" he told CNN affiliate KXAN in Austin. He said he has 9,500 peach trees in his 90-acre family orchard. The trees, which are dormant this time of year, need cold, wet weather to produce a crop. Share your cold weather stories, photos . On the West Coast, a storm was rolling into the area between Seattle and San Francisco, with the brunt heading into Northern California, according to CNN meteorologist Rob Marciano.

"London, England (CNN) -- The fashion brand created by Alexander McQueen is to survive despite the designer's suicide last week, the label's majority stakeholder Gucci Group has confirmed. ""I believe strongly in the Alexander McQueen brand and its future,"" Gucci Group CEO Robert Polet said in a statement carried on the Web site of Gucci parent PPR. The future of McQueen's 11-store, 180 employee fashion house had been uncertain following the 40-year-old's death, with industry experts speculating it was not successful enough to endure without its figurehead. PPR on Thursday revealed a company-wide net profit rise of 6.9 percent to €984.6 million ($1,328 million) but a 4 percent revenue fall to €16.52 billion. It did not break down figures to reveal McQueen's turnover, but reports speculate the brand is running at a loss despite heavy celebrity endorsements. The Times of London reported on Thursday that the label had struggled to make a profit and analysis of recent accounts showed it had liabilities of more than £32 million ($49 million). PPR boss Francois-Henri Pinault said in a statement: ""Lee Alexander [McQueen] was a pure genius and a poet who was imaginative and original. His art went beyond the fashion world. The Alexander McQueen trademark will live on. This is the best tribute that we could offer to Lee."" McQueen's death last week shocked the world of fashion, with many in the industry paying tribute to a man they described as a unique talent capable of becoming a major name. A coroner on Wednesday said McQueen hanged himself in his wardrobe and left a suicide note . McQueen, who had dressed stars from Sarah Jessica Parker and Nicole Kidman to Rihanna and Sandra Bullock, killed himself nine days after the death of his mother. He expressed his devastation at her death on his Twitter account days before he died. McQueen was born in 1970 in London's East End, the son of a taxi driver and trained in London's Savile Row, going on to study fashion at college before making his name with his own extravagant designs. French luxury brand Gucci Group acquired a 51 percent stake in McQueen in 2001.","Gucci Group says McQueen label to survive despite his death .

"(CNN) -- The annals of late-night television talk shows are full of failure. George Lopez says he believes late-night talk is ready for more diversity. Joey Bishop, Dick Cavett and Pat Sajak all tried to challenge the legendary Johnny Carson's supremacy; all fell short. Joan Rivers lasted less than eight months as host of a Fox show; Chevy Chase lasted less than eight weeks on his Fox entry. Even in recent years, when late-night shows are all over cable, few make a dent in the ratings or in the public consciousness. So does comedian and former sitcom star George Lopez believe he can overcome those challenges and put on a talk show people will talk about? To paraphrase a slogan Lopez heard plenty last year, when he traveled the campaign trail as one of Barack Obama's supporters: yes ... he ... does. ""I believe that that audience is more diverse, less represented than it's ever been,"" he said in a phone interview, noting that -- though it's been 20 years since the African-American performer Arsenio Hall launched his late-night show -- late night remains the preserve of generally white male comedians. ""It's not even about black and white anymore, because so many people are from mixed backgrounds and mixed ethnicities, and it's just a great time to be able to pull all that together."" Lopez, whose show will air on TBS beginning in November, is no stranger to talk shows. He was on Johnny Carson's ""Tonight"" show, and he admires David Letterman and Bill Maher, among others. But he thinks a Lopez show will bring some fresh energy to late night. (TBS, like CNN, is a unit of Time Warner.) The comedian says he already has big plans to make his show distinctive, from its more open setting to Lopez's determination to make the audience a key part of the show. He talked about some of his hopes with CNN last week. The following is an edited version of that interview: . CNN: So I see you're doing a late-night talk show. George Lopez: Yes, brother. Change has come to the White House, change has come to late night! CNN: How did this come about? Lopez: Well ... when I was doing ""The George Lopez Show"" -- probably into like the 30th episode, [and] we ended up doing 120 shows, [a production company executive] said, ""Hey, would you consider a talk show?"" And I'm like, ""Dude, I got a gig."" He said, ""It's not going to last forever. When it's over ... [So] let me put this bug in your ear, five years early."" I kinda never considered it, although ... I've been on every show. And what's appealing to me now ... is that I believe that that audience is more diverse, less represented than it's ever been. ... I can take a little more liberties than if this show were on network TV, where everybody's afraid to say something wrong because you might piss off an advertiser. [And] I believe the fact that a Mexican-American guy hosting his own late-night talk show is appealing to advertisers. I look at that as a positive. Look, Anderson Cooper is at the Mexican border -- I wish my show were on tonight so I could talk about it. CNN: Does it intimidate you getting a late-night talk show? Lord knows there have been a zillion late-night talk shows, and many of them end up in TV graveyards. Lopez: I think it goes case by case, Todd. I mean, Chevy Chase probably wasn't the right person for that format ... I think the visibility of my [sitcom] and the success and popularity of my standup, and being a little edgier and a little different and not milquetoast by any means and not Anglo white male, and being unafraid and seeing the change [will help]. ... I think it helped me to campaign with Barack Obama for a year. ... I know what's out there, and I know that that audience is not served, and cable TV is a great place to attract those people. CNN: The press release mentions a ""street-party atmosphere."" Have you had a chance to work through that a little bit and decide what that means? Lopez: Absolutely. We shot a production pilot ... [and] what we did was we created an amphitheater outside at Warner Bros., right where they shoot ""ER"" where the ambulance entrance is. We built a set there, and I used Shakira's band led by [her musical director] Tim Mitchell. ... We didn't use seats, we used kind of an amphitheater feel, and since we shot it out on the street, it did have a different feel. ... With a younger audience and the music, [it] made it more exciting and a little different with me as host than I think than what's on late night now. CNN: You mentioned having Shakira's band. Is that going to be a regular feature? Is there going to be a sidekick? Lopez: I'm not going to do a sidekick, but I'll use audience members, so I'll have potentially 360 sidekicks if I see somebody who's really interesting. One of the aspects we used in the pilot was having audience members actually ask questions from their seat -- not from a preset microphone, but from their seat. ... That's a part of it that I think is different and fun, and I don't want there to feel like you're at a movie, where you're just watching a show. I want you to feel like you can potentially be part of it. Like I told somebody before, if you go to a flea market or a swap meet, you'll find anything you want, but if you go to a store that's a high-end department store, you're only going to find what they have. So being a poor guy growing up, and getting stuff from thrift shops growing up, I'd like to think that this will be the flea market of late-night talk shows, that you can probably find anything there.","George Lopez beginning late-night talk show in November .

"OAKLAND, California (CNN) -- Fifth-grader Christopher Rodriguez sat down Thursday at his piano for his weekly lesson, arched his fingers over the keys and began to play. 10-year-old Christopher Rodriguez was hit by a stray bullet, paralyzing him for life, doctors say. Across the street from Harmony Road Music School in north Oakland, California, Jared Adams, 24, allegedly raised his gun at a Chevron gas station attendant during a holdup and fired. A bullet ripped through the walls of Christopher's classroom striking him in his side, piercing his kidney and spleen and lodging in his spine. The bullet barely missed the 10-year-old's heart. He will likely be paralyzed for life from the waist down, doctors say. ""This is probably the worst thing that's ever happened to me in my life. I love my son greatly,"" the boy's father, Richard Rodriguez, said Friday at a news conference.  Watch Christopher's dad describe the ordeal » . Christopher loved music. He had recently taken up African drumming, spent hours listening to classical music and played basketball. ""I feel like half his life was taken from him; his inability, probably, to walk -- ever,"" Rodriguez said, his voice breaking. Christopher's mother, Jennifer Rodriguez, had been waiting outside in her SUV for her son's lesson to end. She not only heard the shots but came close to being hit herself. At least two bullets from Adams' gun struck her vehicle, police said. On the phone and distracted, she at first dismissed the noises as someone throwing rocks at her SUV. But when she realized it was gunfire, she dashed into her son's class. Christopher was on the floor, his classmates and instructor hovering over him. ""I can't feel my legs! I can't feel my legs!"" Christopher cried. As emergency workers rushed the boy to the hospital, police were chasing Adams, who was speeding away. Adams rammed his vehicle into a car carrying a woman and her two children and then slammed into a parked car, police said. The woman and children escaped without injury, according to authorities. Adams was charged Monday with attempted murder, robbery, evading a police officer, driving recklessly and being an ex-felon in possession of a firearm, Oakland Police Department spokesman Roland Holmgren told CNN. He's being held without bail, according to Holmgren. CNN was not immediately able to determine whether he had a lawyer. Authorities found a ski mask, loaded gun and cash at the scene. Adams has prior convictions for driving under the influence and gun possession, records show. He pleaded no contest to felony evading arrest in 2006 for fleeing an Emeryville police officer and had run from or physically resisted a California Highway Patrol officer and police in Albany and Berkeley, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. Adams once complained in court that young people raised in the city like himself never got opportunities, the paper also reported. Adams has been told about Christopher, said Holmgren. ""It doesn't matter whether it's your first day on the street as an officer or a veteran, to see a child doing something as innocent as taking a piano lesson and have this happen to him, it affects your soul,"" said Holmgren. Meanwhile, doctors delivered tragic news about Christopher's future. ""He's going to face years of rehabilitation,"" said Dr. James Betts, chief of surgery at Children's Hospital Oakland. ""We are all hoping there will be some degree of recovery. We feel like the injury is permanent, and the paralysis is permanent. ""[It will be] a challenging life for this young boy."" Christopher's friends and fellow music lovers plan to help him. Harmony Road Music School will hold a benefit concert for the Rodriguez family February 10 at 2 p.m. at Chapel of the Chimes, a place of worship near the school. ""The family is going to have to, essentially, make a home for a disabled child now,"" said school owner Jim Callahan. ""They'll have to change the stairs in their home, make all sorts of expensive adjustments."" Callahan met with instructors at Harmony Road Monday. They are talking about the incident with the students old enough to understand what happened. Classes have not stopped. ""Music has a healing quality all its own,"" said Callahan. ""We will not be terrorized by this."" E-mail to a friend .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Transportation Security Administration is upgrading security clearances for 10,000 of its airport personnel, giving them access to ""secret"" intelligence to help them better detect threats and stop terrorists, the agency said Friday. To date, the agency has granted access to secret-level classified information to 744 front-line supervisors, managers and behavior-detection officers. It now hopes to be able to give that clearance to all 10,000 supervisory personnel in the next two years, it said. The change does not involve airport screeners, the people responsible for inspecting people and luggage at airport checkpoints. ""It's a natural progression,"" TSA spokeswoman Sterling Payne said. ""It's the next step in professionalizing our work force. What this will do is give them a leg up and a little more detail than what they're getting in the [current] briefing."" The change will empower the employees and make sure they have up-to-date and accurate information about intelligence threats, she said. The majority of the agency's headquarters managers already have secret- or higher-level clearances for classified information. James Carafano, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, said it is a good idea to increase the number of aviation security officials with access to intelligence. The move could decrease the chance that information will be leaked because employees who are given clearance are trained to treat the information appropriately, he said. Officers also must undergo additional background checks before receiving the upgraded status, the agency said. The Transportation Security Administration said personnel granted security clearances are educated about their responsibility to protect classified information, sign a non-disclosure agreement and take annual refresher training. Under the federal government's system of classifying information, ""secret"" clearance is above ""restricted"" and ""confidential"" but below ""top secret."" Randall Larsen, director of the Institute for Homeland Security, was enthusiastic about the expanded base of people with access to ""secret"" intelligence, saying it is particularly needed by behavior detection officers, who look for travelers exhibiting unusual behavior. ""Just think, if we had pulled that Christmas bomber aside and spoken to him for just a few minutes, he would have never gotten on that plane,"" Larsen said. But support for the move isn't universal. ""Our members are screaming because the problem is, as it always has been, that [airline pilots] are being left behind,"" said David Mackett, president of the Airline Pilots Security Alliance. ""I'd much rather have the critical information get to the flight crews"" and flight attendants, he said. Mackett said airport security personnel ""see passengers for several seconds, and yet they're not sharing [information] with air crews who see them for several hours."" He also said the TSA has ""a very high turnover rate"" compared with that of flight crews, so sensitive information will migrate away from the government. Mike Karn, security chairman for the Coalition of Airline Pilots Association, agreed that flight crews should receive ""secret"" information, saying terrorists have proved that they can still get on aircraft. ""You have to strengthen them all the way up to that last line of defense,"" Karn said.","TSA says access to ""secret"" intelligence will help them better detect threats .
Change does not apply to airport security screeners .
New clearances will be above ""confidential"" but below ""top secret"""
"(CNN) -- Pakistan cricket legend Imran Khan has described how the unfolding crisis in Haiti revived harrowing memories of a similar earthquake in his own region. The devastating 7.6 magnitude quake struck northern Pakistan and the divided Kashmir region in October 2005, claiming the lives of almost 80,000 people, according to official estimates, and leaving millions homeless. Khan, who is now a prominent politician and campaigner for social issues in Pakistan, told CNN Thursday that he was left numbed by the scenes which greeted him as he traveled to some of the worst-affected areas in the aftermath. ""It was one of the most traumatic experiences I've ever had. Just watching human suffering, he said. ""It was the children that really disturbed me ... their crushed limbs. ""There were so many people needing attention. I remember seeing makeshift hospitals where they were amputating. That was difficult to take. ""Families were torn apart as parents lost their children and children were orphaned. Whole families were caught inside buildings, while few escaped."" Khan recalled being overwhelmed by the sight of an entire town being reduced to rubble. ""We arrived in the town of Balakot and it was totally flattened. You don't know what to do or say. So many people needing help at one time and you don't have the infrastructure, you don't have the hospitals to help."" Desperation grips Haitian capital . Balakot was one of the worst-hit places, with one in 10 of about 20,000 residents killed, according to the local government of the Mansehra district, where the town of is located. Thousands more were injured. Pakistani authorities later planned to move the town in the country's North West Frontier Province to a completely new location, owing to its current position on a volatile fault line. The destruction of Balakot brought home to Khan how much people had lost. ""Their livelihoods disappeared overnight,"" he said. ""They had nothing, no business, money, food. ""From what I've seen on television it's similar to what is happening now in Haiti. Clearly they (Haiti) won't have the resources to cope with it, so it will require a real outside effort."" While acknowledging the importance of the international aid effort, Khan pointed to role ordinary Pakistanis played in 2005. ""It was incredible. The government was incapacitated but there were little charities and groups forming all over the area trying to help. ""I was in an earthquake-hit area on the second day and I'll never forget seeing a three-mile queue of people trying to get to what was a largely remote area to help with whatever they could put in their cars. ""The government was paralyzed but people came forward, from rich to poor, young to old."" He also pointed to the success volunteer networks had in adopting villages and towns, taking responsibility for providing basic shelter, food and medicine. ""Everyone took responsibility,"" recalled Khan. ""Each group would look after a specific issue until the local population was able to get back on its feet. ""It's so important that the aid effort continues months after the disaster.""","Earthquake struck northern Pakistan, divided Kashmir region in 2005, claiming 80,000 lives .

"(CNN) -- The body of Luis Francisco Cuellar Carvajal, governor of the department of Caqueta, Colombia, was discovered Tuesday not far from where he was kidnapped the night before, government spokesperson Wilmer Rua said. Cuellar Carvajal's throat was slit, Colombian President Alvaro Uribe said in an address to the nation Tuesday night. The governor's body was found by Colombian troops in an area close to his home, where he was kidnapped Monday night, he said. One of his bodyguards was killed in the high-profile abduction, and two other officers were injured . The kidnapping was carried out by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC by its Spanish initials, Colombian Defense Minister Gabriel Silva said earlier Tuesday. Uribe had ordered the military to find and rescue Cuellar Carvajal from the rebel group. The Marxist insurgent group has been fighting the Colombian government for more than 45 years. This is the fifth time the governor has been kidnapped, Rua said. This time, he was taken late at night, about two hours before his 69th birthday. Uribe said that members of the FARC kidnapped Cuellar Carvajal at about 10 p.m. Monday. Authorities ordered the city on lockdown in an attempt to keep the kidnappers from carrying out their plan, Uribe said. Instead, the the guerrillas burned the vehicle that authorities believe was used in the kidnapping, and then slit the governor's throat to avoid leaving evidence that may have been traced from a firearm to the killers, Uribe said. The president offered a $1 billion peso reward (U.S. $485,000) for information leading to the arrests of those responsible.","Governor's body is found by Colombian troops in an area close to his home .

"(CNN) -- Five-time gold medal speed skater Eric Heiden was hanging out in a Team USA locker room Saturday, watching TV as a much younger phenom named Apolo Ohno broke his 30-year Olympic record. That record, for the most decorated American man in Winter Olympics history, stood since 1980, when Heiden shot to fame at the Winter Games in Lake Placid, New York. To hear Heiden tell it, watching the 27-year-old Ohno eclipse his record didn't matter much. ""Apolo and I couldn't have cared less,"" said Heiden, now 51. ""All of us at this level don't really look at medal records as very important. We're very proud of what we are doing and what we've done as athletes -- and if you happen to win a medal all of us consider that to be a great thing."" The difference between Ohno's medals and Heiden's is that Heiden won his all during the same Winter Olympics, an unprecedented feat that astonished Olympic fans around the world. Fast forward 30 years and Heiden's passion for athletic competition and camaraderie hasn't faded. Now an orthopedic surgeon, he treats and helps train the 2010 men's speed skating team, including Ohno. ""Apolo is very dedicated and focused in his pursuit of the sport,"" said Heiden. ""But he needs to understand that when an event is coming up he needs to really start backing off some of those outside interests so he can put in the time and effort to be a world-class skater."" With a smile in his voice, Heiden offers an example of Ohno's recent appearance on ABC's ""Dancing with the Stars."" ""He's more of a celebrity personality than most of the skaters,"" said Heiden. Heiden's fairly familiar with celebrity. Those five medals in Lake Placid got his boyish Wisconsin face plastered on newspapers and TVs worldwide. Although Heiden said he isn't recognized much anymore, once in a while his name ""will fire a synapse in many people's minds."" Living a quiet life in Park City, Utah, with his wife, who is also an orthopedic surgeon, and two children, Heiden advises some of the world's fastest men on skates, including Ohno's friend and fellow Olympian Shani Davis. Helping Davis, who won speed skating gold Wednesday night in the 1000m long track, requires ""making sure that all his needs are taken care of,"" said Heiden. ""Sometimes that can be very demanding and very hard."" Davis accepts little training guidance from others. One of the younger skaters on the U.S. team, 19-year-old J.R. Celski won his first Olympic medal Saturday with a bronze in the men's 1500m short track. What's remarkable, according to Heiden, was that Celski had been badly injured in competition just five months earlier. Celski, who crashed into the boards during trials in September slicing a deep gash into his left thigh, has made a near complete recovery, said Heiden. He said Celski's race on Saturday answered important questions about his mental recovery. ""Physically, we were sure he was good, but we weren't sure about his confidence level before the race."" Celski said he'd met Heiden before his injury, but it was while the doctor was treating Celski that they got to know each other well. ""He's very humble and very down to earth, and I strive to be like that as well. It was great to get to know him and talk to him for who he was -- and not for what he did,"" said Celski. ""He was one of the hardest working guys in the sport, and that's why he did so well."" The cheese remedy: A second opinion . Would Dr. Heiden offer a second opinion about U.S. skier Lindsey Vonn's much talked-about home remedy for a bruised shin? She injured herself during practice just days before winning gold Wednesday in the alpine downhill. Vonn's remedy: wrapping her shin with a soft Austrian cheese. ""We like to practice evidence-based medicine,"" he said jokingly. ""I don't think anybody is going to take that remedy home and practice it on their patients."" The closest thing to a home remedy for Heiden was the random newspaper, moleskin or felt he and fellow skaters would use to pad their skate boots to make them fit better. ""You're always trying to work with what you've got,"" he said. ""But I've never gone as crazy as telling somebody to do a cheese wrap."" Let's remember that before he became a doctor Heiden set four Olympic records and a world record at Lake Placid. Shortly after his history-making feat, Heiden launched a second career racing bicycles, eventually competing in the Tour de France. This year, Heiden enjoyed Vancouver's opening ceremonies with other Olympic veterans, some of whom also gained fame on ice: figure skaters Kristi Yamaguchi and Scott Hamilton. Each Olympian, he said, knows what the other has gone through to reach their athletic dreams. ""We enjoy the limelight,"" said Heiden. ""We were recognized for what we did. And when you go back for each Olympics you sort of get your ego stroked again."" Much has changed about long track speed skating in the past 30 years, but Heiden said no single development has done more to push athletes faster around the icy oval than the clap skate. Unlike traditional skates with blades well-fixed at the bottom of the boots, the blades on clap skates are hinged at the balls of the feet, shaving a precious 2 seconds off a skater's time with each lap. ""I'm jealous, I wish I'd had a chance to try those things."" Has anything else changed in the sport over the years? Yes, he said, most speed skaters now perform in warmer indoor venues. Laughing he describes the effects of brutally cold temperatures on the male anatomy. ""Oh boy, these guys have no clue how cold it can be out on an open rink.""","Eric Heiden won five gold medals in speed skating at the 1980 Winter Olympics .

"(CNN) -- Authorities hunting the killer of a police officer in Northern Ireland last week say they have seized a gun and ammunition. Two people in masks prepare to throw petrol bombs in Lurgan, Northern Ireland. They were found Saturday in Craigavon, the town where Stephen Carroll, 48, was shot dead on Monday, a police statement said Sunday. Authorities also arrested two more people in connection with the killing of Carroll -- a 37-year-old man and a 30-year-old woman. That brings the total in custody to five, police told CNN. And they arrested another person over the killing of two soldiers just days before Carroll was killed. A total of four people are now in custody in the killing of soldiers Cengiz ""Pat"" Azimkar, 21, and Mark Quinsey, 23, at the Massereene barracks March 7. The Massereene barracks killings were the first fatal attack on British troops in the province for more than 12 years. Carroll was the first police officer killed in political violence since 1998. The shootings have raised fears that the province could plunge back to the sectarian violence that claimed the lives of 3,600 people over three decades before the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. The Continuity IRA, a republican splinter group that does not accept the Good Friday Agreement, said it had killed Carroll, while the Real IRA, another splinter group, said it had killed the soldiers, Britain's Press Association reported. Northern Ireland's top police officer, Hugh Orde, insisted Sunday that the militant groups that want the province to leave the United Kingdom and become part of Ireland are ""small ... disrupted, infiltrated and disorganized."" ""The current wisdom is that they number around 300 in a population of 1.75 million,"" he wrote in Britain's News of the World newspaper. But, he said: ""In the past 18 months or so there have been at least 25 attempts by dissident terrorists to kill officers on and off duty."" Rioting flared near Belfast, the capital of Northern Ireland, after an earlier round of arrests Saturday. Police said petrol bombs were hurled at police in Lurgan, west of Belfast. There were no arrests or injuries reported, despite gangs of youths on the streets, authorities said. One of the men arrested in connection with the killing of the soldiers, Colin Duffy, 41, is from Lurgan. He was among three whose arrests were announced Saturday. A fourth man was arrested Saturday night, said the police spokeswoman, who declined to be named in line with policy. She released no details about the man or the location of the arrest. The two British soldiers were shot dead a week ago at a base in Massereene, in Antrim, as they were preparing to ship out for duty in Afghanistan. The soldiers had packed their bags and changed into their uniforms, authorities said. Two masked gunmen with automatic rifles shot them as the soldiers picked up a pizza delivery at the barracks, authorities said. Two other soldiers and the two pizza delivery men were seriously wounded. Politicians from across the political spectrum have condemned the killings, with Sinn Fein deputy leader Martin McGuinness calling the killers ""traitors to the island of Ireland."" Sinn Fein is a predominantly Catholic party that wants Northern Ireland to leave the United Kingdom and become part of the Republic of Ireland. The party is widely thought to be linked to the Irish Republican Army. Danny Kennedy, deputy leader of the loyalist Ulster Unionist Party, which wants Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom, also condemned the attack as ""wicked and murderous.""","Authorities hunting killer of policeman in N.

"(CNN) -- A possible merger between the two of the largest companies in the concert business has raised protests from singer Bruce Springsteen and prompted a congressman to call for a federal anti-trust investigation. A possible merger between Ticketmaster and Live Nation has drawn interest. Ticketmaster, which has long dominated ticket sales, is reportedly in merger talks with Live Nation, the world's largest concert promoter, which just recently began selling its own tickets. Live Nation did not respond to a CNN inquiry, while Ticketmaster's spokesman said ""we cannot comment on rumor or speculation."" ""Being two public companies, they can't really comment on it right now, but it seems very real to me,"" said Ray Waddell, Billboard magazine's concert tour reporter. iReport: What do you think of the possible merger? ""You're talking about a hugely powerful entity if these two combine forces,"" Waddell said. ""They're locking up a whole lot of the revenue streams for live music, and that is really the most consistent and profitable part of the music business right now."" Ticketmaster, long a target of fan and artist criticism, drew Springsteen's ire this week when it routed some of his fans trying to buy tickets to his show in New Jersey to a ""secondary site"" where they were charged far more than face value. Tickets on that site -- which Ticketmaster owns -- cost between $200 and $5,000, while face value starts at $54. Springsteen, in a message posted on his Web site, accused Ticketmaster of ""in effect 'scalping' "" the tickets. Ticketmaster CEO Irving Azoff apologized to Springsteen in a letter Wednesday, saying it wouldn't happen again. New Jersey Congressman Bill Pascrell, who said he was ""deluged this week by calls from angry music fans,"" sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission chairman asking that the FTC look into Ticketmaster's practices. After reports that Ticketmaster and Live Nation might merge, Pascrell sent another letter to the House Judiciary Committee calling for a probe. ""There is an incredible potential for abuse when one company controls the primary and secondary market for concert tickets,"" Pascrell wrote. ""That potential will surely be magnified exponentially should one company be able to control every aspect of recording, record sales, licensing, venue ownership and ticket sales."" Springsteen's Web message asked his fans to ""make it known to your representatives"" if they opposed a merger. ""The one thing that would make the current ticket situation even worse for the fan than it is now would be Ticketmaster and Live Nation coming up with a single system, thereby returning us to a near monopoly situation in music ticketing,"" said the message, signed by Springsteen and his agent. Waddell, who has covered the friction between Ticketmaster, artists and fans, said combining the two companies could mean some fan-friendly changes, including rolling all fees into one ticket price to eliminate ""sticker shock"" when fans look at their credit card bill. Ticketmaster's practice of stacking ""convenience fees"" onto purchases inflated ticket prices and drew fan resentment. Ticketmaster pioneered online ticket sales, a modern convenience that did away with long lines at the box office. ""What Ticketmaster has done to ticketing, they've really revolutionized it as far as the old days, when you had to camp out for a high-demand show,"" Waddell said. Waddell said he doesn't expect ticket prices would ""just blow up"" after a merger. ""Traditionally, when there's competition taken out of the marketplace it really doesn't do a lot for lowering prices, but both these companies are very sensitive to the market and what the fans can pay,"" he said. A combined company, though, would control ""everything before, during and after a concert takes place over the course of an entire tour, and that's pretty sizable,"" he said.","Ticketmaster, Live Nation reportedly in merger talks .

"(CNN) -- Peggy Bourland can't eat. When she lies down to sleep, she fights the urge to go outside and curl up on the cold, hard ground. ""Ken can't eat right now. He can't sleep in our bed,"" she said, her husband's military dog tags around her neck. ""I won't have what he cannot have."" Last Tuesday, from his room at the Hotel Montana near Port-au-Prince, Haiti, U.S. Air Force Maj. Ken Bourland sent an e-mail to his wife telling her that he was fine and had just settled in for what was going to be an exciting time taking a disaster preparedness course. It was 4:51 p.m. ET. Less than 10 minutes later, an earthquake leveled much of the Haitian capital, including the Hotel Montana. ""I had just clicked off the e-mail and was trying to find some cartoons for the kids to watch,"" she said. ""And then I saw this breaking news. An earthquake. I thought, 'Did California get hit again?' Then I saw Haiti."" Bourland popped her laptop open and fired off an e-mail: ""Please tell me you're OK."" No response. View or add to CNN's database of missing persons in Haiti . Crews have spent the past six days searching mounds of rubble, 30 feet high in places, that was the Hotel Montana, popular with tourists and visiting officials. Some United Nations employees who lived there remain unaccounted for, the U.N. said Sunday, and Alain Joyandet, the French minister of cooperation, said approximately 200 French tourists staying there had not been heard from. There is reason to hope. On Friday, a woman trapped in the hotel's collapsed bar was rescued. In the past few days, students from South Florida's Lynn University, who were in Haiti on a humanitarian mission to feed the poor, were freed from the Montana's rubble. Six others with the university are reportedly still missing. Peggy Bourland gets two calls a day at her suburban South Florida home -- one at night, one in the morning -- from the family's assigned military liaison. There's nothing to say, really. She's told to be optimistic. She tries. After the second call, when she has tucked the couple's sons, 16-month-old Andrew and 3-year-old Charley into bed, she allows herself to cry. ""I don't do it in front of them."" She finds it overwhelming to return to thoughts about the Sunday before Ken Bourland left. It was Charley's birthday, and another military family came over. ""Ken sang to him and we all said, 'Daddy's going on another trip.'"" The Bourlands' fifth wedding anniversary will be in March. Their first date -- set up by her boss and his sister -- was one with hours of talk and lost time. She liked the fact that he asked questions about every conceivable scenario that might arise from a decision. He analyzed, where she just went with it. He prepared for the small and big things. He had been mulling for weeks, exhausting Google, over what kind of television to buy. Ken's steady demeanor has rubbed off on Chance, his stepson. Peggy's son was 9 when she introduced him to Ken. The helicopter pilot endeared himself quickly with camping and a mutual zest for video games and remote control cars. Now 13, Chance understands what's going on. ""I let him talk when he wants to,"" she said. ""But sometimes there's nothing to say. You just wait and continue to wait, hoping for something good.""","Peggy Bourland's husband, U.S. Air Force Maj.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Barack Obama's victory Tuesday over John McCain capped an unprecedented rise in American politics. Barack Obama, addressing supporters after his victory, was an unlikely nominee not that long ago. The obscure state legislator with, as he put it, ""a funny name"" propelled himself onto the national stage at the Democratic National Convention four years ago with a speech so electrifying that commentators declared he would become America's first black president. Election Day showed that, in this case at least, you can believe the hype. But Obama did not win the White House on hype, any more than he won it on hope. He won it with an organization that even opponents called brilliant. He won it with a clear strategy that was stuck to with remarkably little internal drama. He won it with unparalleled fundraising and an overwhelming ground game. And he won it after facing various challenges and turning them to his advantage. Turning points . Winning Iowa: Obama's victory in the Iowa caucuses knocked almost all of his Democratic competitors out in the first nominating contest, and it pushed the ""inevitable"" Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, back on her heels. He'd built an organization strong enough to haul supporters out of their homes on a frigid January night to debate, harangue and cajole their neighbors into backing him. Tens of thousands of new voters became the key to his Iowa win and revealed the outline of a general election plan: Create a wide coalition to bring new voters to the polls in record numbers. Ted Kennedy: Within weeks of Iowa, all of Obama's Democratic competitors had dropped out of the race except for Clinton, who split the races with him in the run-up to Super Tuesday. It was then that Ted Kennedy, head of the only Democratic family to outrank the Clintons, came out for Obama, comparing the Illinois senator to his assassinated brother, President John F. Kennedy. The move was deeply symbolic, not just for the public but also the party. The Obama-Clinton battle then hinged on who could sway more superdelegates -- the party leaders who could decide the winner if the primary voters could not -- and few superdelegates had the stature of Ted Kennedy. Addressing race: Race was always going to be a factor in Obama's campaign, even if he hoped his candidacy would transcend it. Clips of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, his longtime pastor, making hateful remarks hit the Internet and television and put Obama on defense. He responded with a speech in March hailed by commentators as among the most thoughtful ever delivered on race by an American politician. When Wright went further, so did Obama -- condemning him outright and later quitting his church. All this time, black voters were rallying behind Obama, switching their allegiance from Clinton in such large numbers that party elders, such as civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, had to do the same. Fundraising: Flush with cash from a nationwide network of small and large contributors, Obama announced in June he would opt out of public financing -- the first presidential candidate to pay for his campaign with donations rather than government money since the system began in 1976. McCain hammered Obama for reneging on a promise to stick with public financing, but the issue failed to resonate with voters. Obama kept raising and spending record amounts of money, using it to send staff across the country -- even to dozens of states Democrats hadn't won in years -- and to swamp the airwaves with advertising. Working with Clinton: The long and bitter primary battle turned many Clinton supporters off Obama. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll a month after Obama sealed the nomination found that nearly 50 percent of Clinton's supporters did not plan to vote for Obama in November. McCain tried to exploit the Democrats' divisions and attract Clinton supporters to his side, but the former rivals came together to stop that. Obama and Clinton worked behind the scenes to create a show of public unity, epitomized by Clinton dramatically marching onto the convention floor in Denver to call for the party to nominate Obama by acclamation. The debates: Obama won all three debates in the eyes of the public, polling for CNN suggested, even if he came up with few, if any, memorable promises or knockout blows. The debates showed the classic Obama -- thoughtful, deliberate and steady. Critically, Obama made no gaffes, rounding out a campaign that was remarkably free of them. Barack Obama may have looked an unlikely candidate and an even unlikelier victor only a year ago. But his campaign had a different look. It started small but with big ideas and worked, inexorably, to make them reality. Like any candidate, Obama faced challenges, but he always seemed to take the path that would make him stronger. And, by the end, the campaign and the support was so large, so well organized and so powerful that nothing could prevent Obama's march to victory. CNN's Richard Allen Greene, Rebecca Sinderbrand and Laura Haring contributed to this report.","Barack Obama seemed unlikely to be Democrat nominee a year ago .

"(CNN) -- Torrential rainfall unleashed flooding and spawned a rare tornado warning in California on Tuesday as a series of storms moved through, with more expected Wednesday and Thursday. Weather-related problems also affected Northern California, where Fresno's Yosemite International Airport lost the ability to send passengers through security because of a power outage. Landings and takeoffs were not affected, because a backup system kicked in, said Vikkie Calderon, airport spokeswoman. However, the backup system for the lobby did not kick in. Airlines were remotely checking passengers in Tuesday afternoon, but the outage prevented security screenings until power was restored, Calderon said. By midafternoon, security screenings had resumed. In Southern California, a possible tornado was reported in Huntington Beach by the Orange County emergency manager, the National Weather Service reported. Boats in the nearby harbor and some buildings in the area were damaged, and a vehicle was flipped. As of Tuesday afternoon, about 50 people were in the process of being evacuated from homes in the San Pedro area of Los Angeles because of severe flooding, according to Los Angeles Police Department Officer Gregory Baek. About 20 vehicle rescues took place in the same area, he said. Video from CNN affiliate KCAL showed flooding in Long Beach, where a boater was using a raft to navigate flooded streets lined by cars with water up over their headlights. Watch and read KCAL's reports . A rare tornado warning was issued Tuesday afternoon for southeastern Orange County, including the cities of Mission Viejo and San Clemente, and northwestern San Diego County, including the cities of Oceanside and Carlsbad. The National Weather Service said radar indicated a severe thunderstorm capable of producing a tornado. A 93 mph wind gust was reported by lifeguards at the Newport Beach pier, the weather service said. Gusts of 72 mph and 73 mph were also measured. Are you there? Send us your stories and images. Piers in Orange County were closed because of high surf, according to the Orange County Fire Authority. There were some reports of damage and flooding, but no known injuries, officials said. Forecasters warned the rainfall could trigger slides in recent burn areas and also warned about damaging winds. Some areas received as much as 3 inches of rain on Monday and could see an additional 2 inches Tuesday, the weather service said. Even stronger storms, with heavy rain and powerful winds, are forecast to hit the region Wednesday and Thursday. Wind and rain prompted power outages Monday in Southern California, according to Southern California Edison.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The members of the band Naturally 7 are experts at blowing their own horns -- and they do it without a trumpet or trombone in sight. Naturally 7 engages in ""vocal play"" in performance, emulating the sounds of musical instruments. In fact, you won't see a single instrument when they hit the stage. They are the instruments. ""People are always imitating instruments,"" said first baritone and arranger Roger Thomas. ""People are driving; they hear their favorite song; it gets to the guitar solo part. ... They don't stop singing. They actually start imitating the instrument they hear. We just decided to be crazy enough to bring [that idea] to the stage."" The septet even came up with a name for it: ""vocal play,"" a total reliance on the human voice to mimic a range of instruments and sounds, including the harmonica, bass guitar, trumpet and DJ scratches.  Watch the band do its thing » . Warren Thomas takes beatboxing to a whole new level with his imitation of a drum kit, complete with snare. (He also impersonates a mean guitar.) Rod Eldridge has never played a real trumpet before, though you wouldn't think that if you saw him duplicate the sound of one, lips pursed, his hands in front of him, pressing on imaginary valves. ""To produce the sound, I have to visualize that I'm holding that instrument or whatever in my hand,"" he said. Only one Naturally 7 member has ever played the instrument he imitates, and that's Armand ""Hops"" Hutton, who uses his incredibly deep voice -- you have to step closer when he speaks -- to portray a thumping bass guitar. The group initially formed a decade ago in New York as an a cappella group (oh, yeah, they sing, too). But to make themselves stand out, Naturally 7 decided to be both a singing group and a band. The concept caught on when video of them performing on a Paris subway -- to hilariously mixed reactions from Parisian commuters -- hit YouTube. It has racked up almost 3 million views. And standing ovations became a regular part of the group's experience touring as the opening act for crooner Michael Bublé in 2007 and 2008. The musicians are about to embark on their own tour of Asia, Australia and Europe. With a recent performance of their aptly named song ""Wall of Sound"" on ""The Tonight Show with Jay Leno"" and a new album in the works, they hope to boost Naturally 7's profile in the United States over the next year. Naturally 7 -- which also includes Jamal Reed, Dwight Stewart and Garfield Buckley -- spoke to CNN about the challenges of becoming instruments. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: Traveling and sound checks must be very easy for you. Roger Thomas: We don't have to lug around instruments with all the traveling we do, and that does make that part easier. The sound check part of actually becoming the band, where we're actually the singers and the instruments, that probably takes a longer time. CNN: How so? Thomas: I often call our sound man ""Octopus Hands"" because he's just got to do so many different things. We switch from being the backgrounds to being the lead vocals and then going back to doing a trombone. And these have different sounds and settings, so it's a lot of work on the performance side if we're using microphones. CNN: Are your ""instruments"" ever out of tune? Rod Eldridge: Every now and then. It is the voice, and if you're suffering and you have a cold, its not like you can have a guy come in and [say], ""Oh, let me change my guitar string out."" It's a human thing. Every now and then, you're not as perfect as you would like, but you are always working at it. CNN: Are you continually adding new instruments? Thomas: We definitely are. When we hear something that's brand new, we'll just try to get really close to that sound. There are a couple of things we can't do, like a piano. Piano is like a percussive and a string instrument at the same time, so we leave pianos alone. CNN: Who has the hardest job here, do you think? Thomas: I think we all think we have the hardest job. (laughs) Probably Warren. He has to keep up that drum flow for songs that go for five or six minutes and shows that go for almost two hours. That's a pretty difficult job. CNN: You were the opening act for Michael Bublé for a while. That must have been a great way to introduce you to a whole new audience. Armand ""Hops"" Hutton: Yeah, it was great. We started off with him in Rotterdam, and I don't think we were supposed to keep going after Europe, but the marriage between his set and our set was just so perfect that he kept saying, ""I want to introduce you to my fans here, my fans there."" We've been to Australia and Canada ...  all over the world. CNN: How do people respond when you perform? Thomas: Shock, usually. On the Bublé tour, it would take people usually by the third song to actually get it. By then you can see them bouncing around, hitting each other, going, ""This really is all voice!"" CNN: Are you working on a new album? Thomas: We are working in the studio right now, getting ready for what will probably be our first world release. We don't know what we are going to call it yet, but we do know one thing: It will be all vocal.","Naturally 7 is a seven-man band that sounds like musical instruments .

The Filipino will defend his World Boxing Organization (WBO) welterweight title against Ghanaian Clottey on March 13 at the $1.2billion home of the Dallas Cowboys football team. Pacquiao had been scheduled to face unbeaten American Mayweather on the date before the proposed super-fight collapsed when the Filipino rejected requests from his opponent to have unprecedented random blood testing. But the 31-year-old confirmed that he is now fully focused on his new opponent, not any possible fight with Mayweather. It's going to be a good fight,"" Pacquiao said at a press conference to promote the fight. ""Clottey, he is a good fighter, a top fighter, and he is bigger than me. I have to prepare hard for this fight and train hard and focus."" When asked about Mayweather, Pacquiao's trainer Freddie Roach said things had moved on but revealed his fighter would be ready to take on the American on the right terms. ""Life goes on without Mayweather. He wouldn't agree to a limit of 14 days before the fight. We did our best to appease him but he wouldn't go along with it,"" Roach explained. ""Mayweather's people agreed to it but Mayweather wouldn't go along with it. I don't think he wants to fight Manny. It was a smoke screen for him to say no. ""I want to beat this guy's ass, believe me, but he won't give us the opportunity. We will fight him any day of the week. But he doesn't make the rules."" Any Pacquiao-Mayweather fight would have been staged in Las Vegas and Cowboys owner Jerry Jones added that the breakdown in talks benefited him. ""It did. This gave us an opening. We were very aggressive and we were pretty quick to make a deal,"" Jones said. ""We're going to make this one of the most interesting fights to view that there's ever been. We're going to have some fun with it.""","Manny Pacquiao has put failed talks of his fight with Floyd Mayweather Jnr behind him as he turns his focus to a bout with Joshua Clottey.

"(CNN) -- After the gloom of December's postal strikes, Britain's Royal Mail has started the new year in the right tune with the launch of 10 stamps which feature iconic album covers. And who better than guitar shaman Jimmy Page to give it the official stamp of approval? The Led Zeppelin guitarist launched the new set of stamps in London which went on sale Thursday. The special New Year stamps feature classic album sleeves from the last four decades. One of the 10 selected albums was Led Zeppelin's 32 million-selling album, ""IV,"" which Page helped design. It shows a painting of an unknown faggot-bearing man which is said to have been found by Robert Plant in a Reading junk shop. It is not known who the painter was. ""Almost 40 years after the album came out, nobody knows the old man who featured on the cover, nor the artist who painted him,"" said Page in a media statement released by Royal Mail. ""That sort of sums up what we wanted to achieve with the album cover, which has remained both anonymous and enigmatic at the same time,"" he added. It was after extensive research into lists and polls and trawling through thousands of album covers that the final list of 10 was agreed upon, the Royal Mail said. They added that key factors in choosing the covers were the art and album design and not necessarily the music. ""For decades, the album sleeve has been the canvas for some of the most imaginative graphic artists in the world, and this issue celebrates this unique art form and some of its greatest examples,"" said Juliette Edgar, Head of Special Stamps at Royal Mail in the statement. Other chosen album covers include The Rolling Stones' 1969 album ""Let It Bleed,"" which features a cake on the cover baked by a then unknown Delia Smith, Pennie Smith's photography for The Clash's ""London Calling"" and a bent chrome pipe on the cover of Mike Oldfield's ""Tubular Bells.""","Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page launches 10 iconic album covers stamps for the Royal Mail .

"(CNN) -- The pilots' union of Lufthansa began a strike Monday after a last-ditch effort at negotiations over pay and job security failed, a spokeswoman for the airline told CNN. The four-day work stoppage by the pilots' union of one of the world's largest airlines threatened to disrupt travel on more than two dozen partner airlines later on Monday. Lufthansa and the pilot's union, Vereinigung Cockpit, met over the weekend as a last-ditch effort to avoid the strike. More than 4,000 pilots walked off the job at midnight Monday (6 p.m. Sunday ET) through Thursday over protracted contract negotiations centering around pay and job security. The action by Lufthansa pilots signaled growing labor unrest across Europe. The industrial action by the pilots started the same day that British Airways cabin staff were expected to announce the outcome of its strike vote. On Wednesday in Greece, a mass public and private sector strike is being planned to protest the government's austerity plan. Lufthansa had already canceled two-thirds of its scheduled flights Monday to Thursday ahead of the strike. The bulk of the disruptions are expected to begin later Monday since most German airports prohibit flights overnight. Still, passengers at Frankfurt Airport on Sunday were already feeling inconvenienced. ""It makes me angry because for me, normally I would (leave) on Monday morning,"" said one passenger. ""Now I have to go Sunday evening and my family's at home and I have to (return) tomorrow night with the train. So it's uncomfortable."" ""It's inconvenient and it's not justified at all,"" another passenger said. Company officials admitted it would have a ""heavy influence"" on its international operations, which includes flights to 80 countries worldwide. Send your views and experiences to CNN iReport . In 2008, Lufthansa was the number two international carrier by passengers with 42.2 million, according to the International Air Transport Association. The threatened walkout came as the airline industry is digging out of the worst one-year drop-off in flights, according to IATA. In 2009, revenues dropped nearly 15 percent worldwide after generating a record $535 billion the previous year. Passenger travel fell a record 3.5 percent and freight fell more than 10 percent, according to IATA figures. Lufthansa officials said at a news conference last Thursday it would cost the airline about $33 million a day. Many of Lufthansa's pilots have been working without a contract since March and more than 90 percent of the union's members voted to strike, said Jorg Handwerg, a pilot and representative for the union. The union sought a 6.4 percent pay increase. The union is also concerned with the airline's recent buying spree of small regional carriers, such as BMI and Austrian Airlines which, it says, is cannibalizing flights away from union-flown routes. ""We fly less hours and have less potential for (performance-related bonuses),"" Handwerg said. ""We want to have the opportunity to grow, but instead it shrinks."" In a statement, Lufthansa said: ""In addition to demands on job security, however, the union also insisted on a greater say on fundamental entrepreneurial issues, equating to intervention in business management at the airline. That demand cannot be accepted."" The airline is allowing passengers to rebook flights for tickets purchased before February 18 and plans to give German domestic passengers rail vouchers. But one Lufthansa passenger said she is having trouble reaching a compromise with the airline. ""I spent several hours on the phone with Lufthansa to try and figure out what I can do, but now I've been told that I can't even get a refund,"" said Ruth Winblad, who is supposed to fly Monday from Gothenburg, Sweden, to Rome, Italy. Lufthansa is one of the largest carriers on Star Alliance, a network of 26 airlines that share ticketing and routes for international travel. Travelers on Star Alliance flights are advised to check their tickets for Lufthansa flights and contact their carrier about any potential changes, said Markus Ruediger, Star Alliance spokesman. Star Alliance member airlines are: Adria, Air Canada, Air China, Air New Zealand, ANA, Asiana Airlines, Austrian, Blue 1, BMI, Brussels Airlines, Continental Airlines, Croatia Airlines, Egypt Air, Lot Polish Airlines, Lufthansa, Scandinavian Airlines, Shanghai Airlines, Singapore Airlines, South African Airways, Spanair, Swiss, Tap Portugal, Thai Airlines, Turkish Airlines, United Airlines and U.S. Airways. Partner airlines were preparing for the strike. ""Some of our codeshare flights with Lufthansa may be affected during the period of the strike. We are in contact with Lufthansa and will be informed of the affected flights as soon as details are made available,"" said Nicholas Ionides, Singapore Airlines spokesman. ""Should there be customers traveling on affected Lufthansa-operated codeshare flights, they will be contacted and re-accommodated on the best next available schedule."" A spokeswoman for Continental Airlines told CNN on Sunday that the airline will offer passengers refunds or rebook their travel if they are affected.

"African football federation president Issa Hayatou has exclusively told CNN that Togo were not disqualified from the Africa Cup of Nations but were granted permission to leave. The Togo squad flew back home from Angola on January 9 after three of their travelling party were killed and two players seriously injured by a machine-gun attack which occurred as their bus crossed the border into the northern, oil-rich state of Cabinda two days earlier. It had initially been first thought that Togo had been disqualified after they failed to show for their first group game against Ghana on Monday. But Confederation of African Football (CAF) president Hayatou has since confirmed to CNN that they had not been expelled from the tournament but were granted special dispensation. ""Togo wasn't disqualified - I want to tell you that Togo wasn't disqualified. Togo left the competition following the tragic events that the delegation went through,"" Hayatou told CNN. ""Because of what happened the Togolese delegation didn't have the morale or the conscience for them to participate in the tournament. ""We tried to convince them to stay and that life continues after all and that we share their sorrow and suffering. ""We completely understand what happened. The players wanted to stay but the government for their reasons didn't want the Togolese to stay so they left. ""CAF did everything possible to make sure that the Togo team stayed here for the Africa Cup of Nations. We acted and they left. ""Contrary to whatever you are saying they didn't get disqualified. They are the ones who decided to leave which we consented to. There is a difference. ""We would have wished them to stay. We would have wished them stay. We have done everything to possible so that Togo stays. ""They couldn't stay. The players wanted to stay but the political authorities didn't want the delegation to stay."" Group B has now been reduced to three teams: Ghana, Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso. Angolan authorities have arrested two people involved in the attack, state media reported, while goalkeeper Kodjovi Obilale remains in a stable condition in a South African hospital but needs a ventilator as he recovers from being shot. Hayatou also defended CAF's handling of the incident and, in particular, criticism about the amount of time they took to respond. He added: ""When we were told that Togo was attacked we immediately stopped our meeting that we were organizing. We are in Luanda and they were attacked far away! ""We organized ourselves to go see them and this was done quickly for us to help our Togolese brothers. But people who say that we acted very late. I think that it is not right for the press to say so. ""On behalf of the federation, we managed that incident, not just the incident but the tragedy, with lots of tact and lots of honesty, and lots of courage.   ""The incident happened; everyone should have taken his own responsibility.""","CAF president Issa Hayatou has exclusively told CNN that Togo were not disqualified from the Africa Cup of Nations.

"Boston, Massachusetts (CNN) -- In a stunning upset that reshaped the U.S. political landscape, Republican Scott Brown won Tuesday's special election in Massachusetts for the U.S. Senate seat formerly held by liberal Democrat Ted Kennedy. Brown defeated Democrat Martha Coakley, the state attorney general. Brown's victory made real the once unthinkable prospect of a Republican filling the seat held by Kennedy, known as the liberal lion, for almost 47 years until his death due to brain cancer last August. Before Kennedy won the seat for the first time in 1962, his older brother John held it for nearly eight years until his election as U.S. president in 1960. ""This really does change everything, you know that?"" said Mitt Romney, the former GOP governor of Massachusetts who introduced Brown at his victory rally. Share your thoughts on the election results . Voters across Massachusetts braved winter cold and snow for an election with high stakes -- the domestic agenda of President Obama, including his top domestic priority, health care reform. Brown's victory strips Democrats of their 60-seat Senate super-majority, needed to overcome GOP filibusters against future Senate action on a broad range of White House priorities. Senate Democrats needed all 60 votes in their caucus to pass the health care bill, and the loss of one seat now imperils generating that support again for a compromise measure worked out with the House. ""Forty one, forty one,"" chanted the crowd at Brown's rally, referring to his new status as the Senate's 41st Republican. Brown, a state senator until now, heralded his victory as the start of more election surprises in 2010. No Republican had won a U.S. Senate race in Massachusetts since 1972, and Democrats control the governorship, both houses of the state legislature, and the state's entire congressional delegation. ""When there's trouble in Massachusetts, rest assured there's trouble everywhere, and they know it,"" Brown said of the Democratic Party. Republican leaders sounded a similar theme, saying Americans were fed up with what they called Democratic arrogance in Washington. ""Americans are investing their hopes in good Republican candidates to reverse a year-long Democrat trend of ignoring the American people on the issues of health care, spending and the growth of government,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said in a statement. The seat vacated by Kennedy's death is currently held by his former aide and longtime friend Paul Kirk, who was appointed on an interim basis. Obama called Brown and Coakley on Tuesday night, and a White House statement said the president ""told Sen. Brown that he looks forward to working with him on the urgent economic challenges facing Massachusetts families and struggling families across our nation."" Massachusetts Secretary of State Bill Galvin said last week that certifying Tuesday's election results could take more than two weeks -- potentially enough time to allow congressional Democrats to pass a final health care bill before Brown is seated. But multiple Democratic sources said that is unlikely. Even if House and Senate Democrats could reach a deal to meld their bills and pass them in the next couple of weeks, there would be a huge outcry from not only Republicans, but also an increasingly distrustful public if they appeared to be rushing it through. Galvin had predicted as many 2.2 million of the state's 4.5 million registered voters would vote -- at least double the turnout from December's primary. In one sign of high interest, more than 100,000 absentee ballots were requested ahead of the election, according to Brian McNiff, Galvin's spokesman. Coakley was initially expected to easily win the race to replace Kennedy, who made health care reform the centerpiece of his Senate career. Until recently, Brown was underfunded and unknown statewide. Waging a nationally backed campaign that included driving his pickup around the state, Brown surged in the weeks preceding Tuesday's vote and led in all the final polls. In a sign of the high stakes involved, the Coakley campaign held an afternoon news conference Tuesday to complain that voters in three places received ballots already marked for Brown. McNiff confirmed that the secretary of state's offices received two reports of voters saying they received pre-marked ballots. The suspect ballots were invalidated and the voters received new ballots, McNiff said. Kevin Conroy, the Coakley campaign manager, said the ""disturbing incidents"" raised questions about the integrity of the election. In response, the Brown campaign issued a statement criticizing Coakley's team. ""Reports that the Coakley campaign is making reckless accusations regarding the integrity of today's election is a reminder that they are a desperate campaign,"" Daniel B. Winslow, the counsel for the Brown campaign, said in the statement. Obama had been ""surprised and frustrated"" by the race, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Tuesday. Obama and former President Bill Clinton hit the campaign trail in the final week in an attempt to save Coakley's campaign, which observers say was hampered by complacency and missteps. Obama crushed Sen. John McCain in Massachusetts in 2008, beating the GOP presidential nominee by 26 points. ""If you were fired up in the last election, I need you more fired up in this election,"" Obama urged a crowd at a Coakley campaign rally on Sunday. Vicki Kennedy, the late senator's widow, called on state Democrats to turn out to save her husband's legacy. ""We need your help. We need your support. We need you to get out there and vote on Tuesday,"" Kennedy said. ""We need you to bring your neighbors. We need you to bring your friends."" Brown, who has trumpeted his 30 years of service in the National Guard, hewed to traditional GOP themes in his victory speech. He promised to back tax cuts and be tough on terrorists, and to oppose Obama's health care overhaul effort. ""People do not want a trillion dollar health-care plan that is being forced on the American people,"" Brown said. Brown said his victory defied ""the odds and experts"" who predicted that the Senate seat held by Democrats for more than 50 years would not change hands. Instead, independent voters who outnumber registered Democrats and Republicans combined in Massachusetts strongly supported Brown. ""Tonight, the independent majority has delivered a great victory,"" Brown said, later adding: ""What happened here in Massachusetts can happen all over America."" Facing the possibility of Coakley's defeat, Democrats were trying to figure out whether they could pass a health care overhaul without that crucial 60th Senate vote. But top White House aides publicly insisted they were not engaging in any talk of contingency plans because they thought Coakley would win. Two Democratic sources in close contact with the White House told CNN on Monday that they'd urged the administration, in the event of a Brown victory, to push House Democrats to pass the Senate's health care bill as currently written. Doing so would prevent the plan from having to be taken up by the Senate again. ""I think the Senate bill clearly is better than nothing,"" House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, said Tuesday. A third option would be for Democrats to revisit the idea of trying to push health care through the Senate with only 51 votes -- a simple majority. But to do that Democrats would have to use a process known as reconciliation, which presents technical and procedural issues that would delay the process for a long time. A number of Democrats are eager to put the health care debate behind them and move on to economic issues such as job creation as soon as possible this election year. Senate Democrats could also try again to get moderate GOP Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine to vote for a compromise health reform plan. Multiple Democratic sources, however, have said they think that is unlikely now.

"(CNN) -- At least 42 people were killed and 120 injured by flash flooding and mudslides on the Portuguese island of Madeira, the local civil protection agency said Sunday. An unknown number of people are still missing, the authorities told CNN. About 250 people were evacuated to military bases and other safe locations, said Pedro Barbosa of the civil protection agency. ""We have some parts where we can't go because the bridges are down,"" Barbosa told CNN earlier in the day, saying the numbers of victims may rise as more information comes in. He said all the damage occurred in just a few hours Saturday morning due to ""very concentrated, very intense"" rains that sparked flooding and mudslides. The mudslides and flooding damaged roads and homes in the capital, Funchal, and in Ribeira Brava, which are both on the southern portion of the Atlantic island. Floodwaters overturned cars and knocked down trees. Search-and-rescue teams have been reinforced, according to the Civil Protection Agency. Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates said ""the situation is under control"" and the government is offering its support to regional authorities. President Cavaco Silva expressed his condolences in a televised statement and promised to do everything to help. Madeira, an autonomous region of Portugal, is a popular resort destination. There have been no reports of any dead or missing tourists. Barbosa said Saturday's heavy rains were the worst in Madeira since 1993, when a storm killed eight people. Madeira is one of the Madeira Islands, an archipelago about 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) southwest of the Portuguese mainland.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The head of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, General Stanley McChrystal, expressed regret Monday after more than two dozen civilians were killed in a NATO airstrike. Twenty-seven civilians died and 14 others were wounded in the incident Sunday in the central Daikondi province, according to the Afghan Interior Ministry. Ground forces at the scene found women and children among the casualties, the Afghan government and NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) said in a joint statement. The U.S military told CNN Pentagon Correspondent Barbara Starr they ""accept"" the Afghan government's death toll. ISAF said it had ordered an immediate investigation into the incident, while the Afghan cabinet called the attack ""unjustifiable."" ""We are extremely saddened by the tragic loss of innocent lives,"" said McChrystal, who spoke to President Hamid Karzai Sunday evening to express his sorrow and regret over the incident. ""I have made it clear to our forces that we are here to protect the Afghan people, and inadvertently killing or injuring civilians undermines their trust and confidence in our mission. We will re-double our efforts to regain that trust."" Commanders ordered the daylight NATO airstrike because they had specific intelligence that a group of Taliban in vehicles was heading towards coalition forces on the ground, according to a senior U.S. military official. ""Air assets picked up the movement of the vehicles and after an extensive overhead monitoring, the ground force commander ordered the strike,"" said the official, who declined to be identified because of ongoing investigations. The source would not discuss what activities the convoy took that led to suspicions it contained insurgents other than its location. The convoy of three vehicles was traveling to Kandahar province when it was struck, said Zemeri Bashary, the spokesman for the interior ministry. NATO confirmed its forces fired on the vehicles, believing that they were carrying insurgents. In a statement published in Pashtun and Dari, the Afghan cabinet said it condemned ""the repeated killing of civilians by NATO."" An English version of the statement did not include that sentence. Civilian casualties at the hands of U.S. and NATO troops have strained relations between Afghanistan and the United States. In the last two weeks alone, more than 50 Afghan civilians are believed to have been killed in more than half a dozen U.S. and NATO military operations. The coalition is also investigating reports that several Afghan policemen were accidentally killed in an airstrike in eastern Afghanistan on February 18. McChrystal has made avoiding civilian casualties a top priority, and he has apologized to the Afghan government for recent incidents. The numbers have dropped in recent months since McChrystal took over as U.S. commander. The U.S. military official said McChrystal is updating a directive issued to troops last summer aimed at reducing civilian casualties. The official said the intent now is to ""make it more precise and understandable by the most junior member of the force."" Some forces have complained the directive has led to overly restrictive rules on conducting operations. Meanwhile, an influential Afghan tribal leader was among 14 people killed in a suicide attack on a meeting of tribal elders on Monday in Nangarhar province's Khogyani district, Afghan police said according to Agence France-Presse. Haji Zaman Ghamsharik was credited with bringing relative stability to Nangarhar compared to other provinces in Afghanistan's volatile eastern border region. Elsewhere, an insurgent rocket struck a car in Kapisa province Monday and killed one civilian, officials said. Five others were wounded in the attack. Earlier, Afghan officials had blamed the attack on a NATO ground-to-ground missile but later corrected the account.

"(CNN) -- The man believed to be the suicide bomber who killed seven CIA employees and contractors last month appears in a newly released video, in which he vows revenge for the killing of a Taliban leader. The video shows Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi, whom a former U.S. intelligence official identified as the suicide bomber. Al-Balawi's brother told CNN Senior International Correspondent Nic Robertson that the man in the video, who uses the alias Abu Dajana Al-Khorasani, was his sibling. In the tape, which aired Saturday on the Arabic satellite news channel Al-Jazeera, al-Balawi says his message is for the CIA and Jordanian intelligence. The December 30 bombing at a U.S. base in Khost, in southeastern Afghanistan, killed seven CIA operatives and a Jordanian army captain. Al-Balawi was a Jordanian doctor whom Jordanian authorities had recruited as a counterterrorism intelligence source, a Jordanian official told CNN this week. Jordanian and U.S. intelligence agencies apparently believed al-Balawi had been rehabilitated from his extremist views and were using him to hunt Ayman al-Zawahiri, al Qaeda's No. 2 figure, a former U.S. intelligence official said. Al-Balawi says in the video that his faith cannot be sold to bidders, an apparent message to Jordanian and U.S. officials that they had failed to win his allegiance. It puts into question how well the CIA and other intelligence agencies can penetrate al Qaeda. Gen. David Petraeus, head of U.S. Central Command, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that local officials are better at ""human intelligence"" than foreign agents. ""That's not to say that you can't have some real breakthroughs,"" Petraeus said during the interview, to be aired Sunday. ""It's not to say you can't develop sources, you can't put people in there and so forth."" Al-Balawi mentions Baitullah Mehsud, the leader of the Taliban in Pakistan who was killed in a missile strike last August. ""We will never forget the blood of our leader Baitullah Mehsud, may God have mercy on his soul,"" he says in Arabic, according to a CNN translation. ""It will remain that we take revenge (for his death) in America and outside America. It is a trust on every person who left everything for the sake of God, whom Baitullah Mehsud supported."" Al Qaeda's commander of operations in Afghanistan, Mustafa Abu Yazid, said this week that the attack avenged Mehsud's death. Mehsud was the leader of Tehrik-i Taliban Pakistan (TTP). It was TTP that released the video, according to IntelCenter, a think tank that specializes in tracking terrorist groups. At one point, the video shows the date of December 20, 2009. That is five days before Nigerian passenger Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab allegedly tried to blow up a Northwest Airlines flight to Detroit, Michigan. The Yemen-based group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has claimed responsibility for the Christmas Day plot. It is impossible to know whether the date on the video is accurate, or whether al-Balawi was aware of AbdulMutallab's alleged plans. If al-Balawi did know about the plot, it could indicate a greater degree of communication between TTP and al Qaeda than previously thought. In an analysis of the video, IntelCenter said there is a connection between the two groups. But IntelCenter also pointed out al-Balawi appears in the video next to TTP leader Hakimullah Mehsud, and that it was TTP that released the video. ""The TTP and al Qaeda have a close relationship, and in all likelihood al Qaeda was involved at some level in the operation,"" IntelCenter said in an analysis of the video. ""However, the release of the video with TTP Emir Hakimullah Mehsud firmly places the attack under the TTP banner."" Of the seven CIA operatives who were killed in the December 30 attack were two members of the private security firm Xe, formerly known as Blackwater. The Jordanian military officer who was killed was Army Capt. Sharif Ali bin Zeid, a cousin of Jordan's King Abdullah II. It was one of the worst attacks ever on America's intelligence community. CNN's Nic Robertson and Amir Ahmed contributed to this report.","Alleged suicide bomber vowed to avenge Taliban leader in newly released video .

"(CNN) -- I'm not an auto mechanic, I'm an Army wife, a mother and -- when time permits -- a journalist. So when my car needs work, I take it to someone with oil on his hands and years of experience looking under hoods. The same is true for plumbing problems, legal issues and medical care. I don't assume that I know better than the experts. When necessary, I get a second opinion but, ultimately, I always yield to the advice of those who know more than me. With that in mind, I am thrilled that President Obama has decided to listen to his experts -- the military commanders and strategists -- and is committing more troops to Afghanistan. But as an Army wife at Fort Bragg whose husband has already done three tours of duty in Afghanistan, I can't help but close my eyes, grit my teeth and brace myself for the hard days ahead. As happy as I am that the president has finally made a move after months of deliberating, I know that this announcement is likely bad news for me. Deployments are awful -- just awful. There is no bright side and no silver lining. For most of us in the military community the luster of sacrificing for our country wore off a deployment or two ago and we are now coasting on the fumes of commitment and shared sacrifice. Many of us who are married to the military aren't even sure why we are willing to endure yet another deployment. We just are. Our spouses see the fight firsthand and are reminded daily of why this battle must be won. They get pep talks at work and enjoy the camaraderie of their fellow soldiers. We at home just hear the gripes of war-weary Americans and see the news reports of waning support. We don't experience the victories, we only see our children developing emotional problems, our marriages falling apart, our careers sidelined, our dependence on antidepressants climbing, even our houses crumbling from years of neglected repairs. That's why a troop surge in Afghanistan brings mixed feelings. More troops there means more casualties -- a word I don't take lightly. Casualties are people, people with names and faces that I know. I see their wheelchairs at my kids' schools and I've dropped flowers on their freshly dug graves. A troop surge may mean that even more of my friends will be widows and more of their children will be fatherless. It certainly means more Little League teams in my community will be missing a coach, more families here will know each other only on Skype and more pets will be abandoned. It may very well mean that I will spend more years being both mother and father, and that I'll have more conversations with my children about why their daddy is always gone when so many daddies never leave. These are not things to celebrate. But right now, after just hearing our president give an inspiring speech, I'm going to consider that this plan may mean that my friends who are in Afghanistan now will finally have what they need to stay safe. Maybe it will mean that if and when my husband has to go back there, he will be in a better and safer situation. And, more than anything else, maybe it will mean that our nation will succeed in Afghanistan and that all of these years that my husband and I have lost together, all of these friends we've buried, all of these injuries he and others have nursed -- will have been worth it. I am not a strategist. I do not know what will take us to victory in Afghanistan. I cannot say if sending 30,000 more troops is the right or the wrong decision. All I know is that the president consulted the experts and then he sought second, third, fourth -- and who knows how many more -- opinions, and this is the solution he has reached. I commend him for making a definitive plan. I will pray for his wisdom and for the strength and safety of the troops who will be going into harm's way, just as I pray for those who are already there. I will also pray for all the families back home who are about to send their soldier or Marine into the fight. Theirs is a battle I know. For many of them, their war is just starting.

"Washington (CNN) -- Jennifer Tonge is not a lunatic. She is a member of the British House of Lords, appointed to that eminent body in 2005 after a career in politics and medicine. On February 11, she was asked a question by www.thejc.com, the online version of Britain's Jewish Chronicle. Tonge serves as patron of an online journal based in Gaza, the Palestine Telegraph. The previous week, the Palestine Telegraph accused the Israeli medical teams doing humanitarian work in Haiti of harvesting organs from earthquake victims. TheJC.com asked Tonge for comment. Tonge first commended the Israeli teams for their work in Haiti. She then added these words: . ""To prevent allegations such as these -- which have already been posted on YouTube -- going any further, the IDF and the Israeli Medical Association should establish an independent inquiry immediately to clear the names of the team in Haiti."" The YouTube video to which Tonge refers can be seen here. It's the work of a solo crank, and hardly seems to require an ""independent inquiry"" to refute. The statement to TheJC.com was not Lady Tonge's first entry into Middle East analysis. She has expressed herself often on the subject of Israel and Israel's supporters, and in vivid terms. In a speech to a meeting during her Liberal Democratic Party's annual conference in 2006, Tonge declared: ""The pro-Israeli lobby has got its grips on the Western world, its financial grips. I think they've probably got a grip on our party."" (That grip was not too tight to prevent Tonge's party from collectively denouncing Israel for attacking Hezbollah after Hezbollah kidnapped two Israeli soldiers.) On February 14, Lady Tonge was removed from her position as health critic for the Liberal Democratic Party in the House of Lords. But Tonge's comments did not originate in the ether. They could be footnoted to a respectable newspaper in Sweden. In the summer of 2009, the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet published a story about a recent mass indictment in New Jersey. On July 23, the U.S. attorney for New Jersey announced the arrest of 44 people for a range of criminal enterprises involving bank fraud, rigging of bids on public projects, trafficking in counterfeit goods, etc. The accused represented the gorgeous mosaic of New Jersey politics, with last names like ""Suarez,"" ""Catrillo,"" ""Cardwell,"" and ""Khalil."" Some of the names were Jewish. One of the Jewish names, Levy Izhak Rosenbaum, was accused of the lurid crime of trafficking in the purchase and sale of human organs. Rosenbaum was said to have offered sums of $10,000 to entice poor people in Israel and Eastern Europe to sell kidneys to him, which he would then remarket for $160,000 to transplant patients in the United States. Aftonbladet transformed this story of illegal commerce into a story of Jewish predation. The paper gave space to a freelance writer -- Donald Bostrom -- to charge that the Israeli army regularly harvested organs from the bodies of slain Palestinians. After briefly acknowledging that the vast majority of the world's illegally harvested organs come from China, Pakistan, and the Philippines, Bostrom then hurled this astounding charge: . ""Palestinians also harbor strong suspicions that young men have been seized, and made to serve as organ reserve, just as in China and Pakistan, before being killed."" Jewish vampirism is an ancient fantasy, dating back to the Middle Ages. Yet it remains current in the contemporary Middle East. A Syrian film company created a multipart TV drama out of the story in 2003. The drama was broadcast worldwide on Hezbollah's al-Manar satellite network. Iranian state TV broadcast a drama in 2004 in which the plot turns on an Israeli plan to steal Palestinian children's eyes. It's a winding road from medieval folktales to Hezbollah TV to the New Jersey mob to a Swedish daily to the British House of Lords. But it's a road traveled by more and more people. On February 11, Tel Aviv's Reut Institute presented a paper to the Israeli cabinet warning of ""delegitimization"" aimed at the Jewish state. As reported by Ha'aretz, the paper warns: . ""The 'delegitimizers' cooperate with organizations engaging in legitimate criticism of Israel's policy in the territories such as Amnesty [International] and Human Rights Watch, blurring the line between legitimate censure and delegitimization. ... The network's activists are not mostly Palestinian, Arab or Muslim. Many of them are European and North American left-wing activists,"" who portray Israel as a pariah state and deny its right to exist. In the United States, where pro-Israel feeling runs stronger and the activist left is weaker, the delegitimization project focuses less on Israel itself, and more on Israel's supporters. The central text for this project is a book called ""The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy"" co-authored by Profs. Stephen Walt and John Mearsheimer, which argues that ""the Israel lobby"" maneuvered the United States into the Iraq war on Israel's behalf. Walt and Mearsheimer present their argument in delicate language, but it's the same case argued by Prof. Juan Cole of the University of Michigan, again not a crank, but a past president of the Middle East Studies Association. In a 2004 blog post, Cole wrote of a ""one-two punch secretly planned by the pro-Likud faction in the Department of Defense. First, Iraq would be taken out by the United States, and then Iran. David Wurmser, a key member of the group, also wanted Syria included. These pro-Likud intellectuals concluded that 9/11 would give them carte blanche to use the Pentagon as Israel's Gurkha regiment, fighting elective wars on behalf of Tel Aviv (not wars that really needed to be fought, but wars that the Likud coalition thought it would be nice to see fought so as to increase Israel's ability to annex land and act aggressively, especially if someone else's boys did the dying)."" Hard to miss here the echo of another ancient myth, memorably enunciated by a character in John Buchan's 1915 spy novel, ""The Thirty-Nine Steps."" ""[If] you're on the biggest kind of job and are bound to get to the real boss, 10 to one you are brought up against a little white-faced Jew in a bath-chair with an eye like a rattlesnake. Yes, Sir, he is the man who is ruling the world just now."" Walt returned to his theme in a blog post this week in Foreign Policy: . ""Israeli leaders from across the political spectrum became cheerleaders for the invasion, and they played a prominent role in helping to sell the war here in the United States."" This debate came home to the blogosphere last week, when New Republic literary editor Leon Wieseltier published a long article denouncing uber-blogger Andrew Sullivan as either an anti-Jewish bigot or else ""moronically insensitive."" Sullivan -- a former editor of the magazine for which his once-intimate friend Wieseltier writes -- has over the past few months abruptly switched from passionate champion of Israel to strident criticism of Israel and its supporters. Many rallied to Sullivan's defense on the specific complaint at issue, myself included. But one wishes that people who do not share the malignant feelings of a Tonge would take care not to use the same malignant language. It's possible to hate Israel without hating Jews. It's even possible to hate Jews without hating Israel, as is said of a famously nasty British media personality: ""He managed the impressive feat of being intensely anti-Semitic without becoming even slightly pro-Arab."" But these interesting theoretical potentialities exist mainly on the blackboard. In real life, it becomes very difficult to separate hatred of the Jewish state from hatred of the Jews who live in that state. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum says Israel is facing a delegitimization campaign .
He says some critics engage in wild charges without any foundation .

"Washington (CNN) -- Americans are split over whether China represents a military threat to the United States -- but there is no doubt in the public's mind that the country poses an economic threat, according to a new national poll. According to a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey released Monday, 51 percent of the public consider China a military threat, with 47 percent disagreeing. That 4-point margin is within the poll's 4.5 percent sampling error. The poll's release coincides with U.S. President Barack Obama's first visit to China to bolster relations. At a town hall meeting on Monday he made the case to Chinese students that the two countries' philosophical differences should not get in the way of a robust relationship. According to the survey, two-thirds see China as a source of unfair competition for U.S. companies, while only a quarter are more likely to view China as a huge potential market for U.S. goods. ""That may be why 71 percent of Americans consider China an economic threat to the U.S.,"" says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""Americans tend to view foreign countries as competition, and China is no exception."" Only a quarter of those questioned in the poll say that China has a good track record on human rights. Sixty-eight percent suggested that China is doing a bad job respecting the human rights of its citizens. The CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted November 13-15, with 1,014 adult Americans questioned by telephone.

"(CNN) -- A head-banging parrot who became a YouTube sensation has demonstrated that an ability to appreciate music and keep a rhythm is not unique to humans, scientists say. Alex, an African grey parrot, was one of 14 birds which displayed an ability to keep time with a tune. Snowball the cockatoo, who appears to bop his head, tap his claws and squawk enthusiastically to the Back Street Boys' ""Everybody"" is one of several birds apparently capable of dancing to a beat, according to two studies published in the latest edition of the journal Current Biology. In a study lead by Adena Schachner of Harvard University, researchers examined more than 1,000 YouTube videos of dancing animals and found 14 types of parrot species and one elephant genuinely capable of keeping time. The video of Snowball has been viewed more than two million times since it was posted in 2007. Another video of Snowball shows him dancing to Queen's ""Another One Bites the Dust."" Watch Snowball the dancing parrot » . Schachner analyzed the videos frame-by-frame, comparing the animals' movements with the speed of the music and the alignment of individual beats. The group also studied another bird, Alex, an African grey parrot, which had exhibited similar abilities to Snowball, nodding its head appreciatively to a series of drum tracks. ""Our analyses showed that these birds' movements were more lined up with the musical beat than we'd expect by chance,"" says Schachner. ""We found strong evidence that they were synchronizing with the beat, something that has not been seen before in other species."" Aniruddh Patel of The Neurosciences Institute in San Diego, who led another study of Snowball's performance, said that the bird had demonstrated an ability to adjust the tempo of his dancing to stay synchronized to the beat. Scientists had previously thought that ""moving to a musical beat might be a uniquely human ability because animals are not commonly seen moving rhythmically in the wild,"" Patel said. Schachner said there was no evidence to suggest that animals such as apes, dogs or cats could recognize music, despite their extensive experience of humans. That leads researchers to believe that an ability to process musical sounds may be linked to an ability to mimic sounds -- something that each of the parrots studied by researchers was able to do excellently, she said. Other ""vocal-learning species"" include dolphins, elephants, seals and walruses. ""A natural question about these results is whether they generalize to other parrots, or more broadly, to other vocal-learning species,"" Schachner said. Researchers believe a possible link between vocal mimicry and an ability to hear music may explain the development of music in human societies. ""The question of why music is found in every known human culture is a longstanding puzzle. Many argue that it is an adaptive behaviour that helped our species to evolve. But equally plausible is the possibility that it emerged as a by-product of other abilities -- such as vocal learning,"" music psychologist Lauren Stewart of Goldsmiths, University of London told CNN. ""Parrots and humans both have the ability to imitate sounds that they hear, unlike our closer simian relatives. Once a species has the neural machinery in place for coupling the perception and production of vocal sounds, it may be only a small step to use the same circuits for synchronizing movements to a beat.""","Scientists: Dancing parrots prove ability to recognize music not unique to humans .

"(CNN) -- To hear Spc. Alexis Hutchinson tell it, the Army forced her to make an agonizing choice between serving her country and taking care of her son. The Army, however, takes issue with the soldier's story and Hutchinson could now be facing serious charges for desertion. When her unit deployed to Afghanistan earlier in November, Hutchinson was missing from the plane. Her lawyer said she refused to go because there was no one to take care of her 10-month-old son, Kamani, and she feared he would be placed in foster care. The Army said the young mother had plenty of time to sort out family issues and has been confined to her post at Fort Stewart, Georgia, while an investigation unfolds. Before shipping overseas, every soldier must sign military Form D-A 53-05, which states that failure to maintain a family care plan could result in disciplinary action. Hutchinson had agreed to such a plan and her mother, Angelique Hughes, took in Kamani in a month before Hutchinson's deployment date. But after a week with the infant, Hughes, who cares for ailing relatives and runs a day-care out of her home, said she felt so overwhelmed that she backed out. ""It was that hard, because he's a very busy baby,"" Hughes told CNN affiliate WTOC in Savannah, Georgia. ""You have to keep an eye on him 24 hours a day."" Hutchinson's attorney, Rai Sue Sussman, said the soldier informed the Army that her family care plan had fallen through and that there was no one to take care of Kamani. Fort Stewart spokesman Kevin Larson said Hutchinson's unit had known for months about its pending deployment and that it wasn't until the last minute that Hutchinson notified the Army of her child-care woes. Like all soldiers who face similar circumstances, Hutchinson received a 30-day extension back in August and September, Larson said. That's ""plenty of time,"" he said, ""to work out another care plan."" On the eve of her unit's departure, Hutchinson was ordered to be on the plane. ""That's when it put her in this horrible situation of having to choose between abandoning her child or disobeying her superiors,"" Sussman said. ""The sense I got from her and the reason I think why she was scared enough to not go and get on her plane was because they would take her child from her."" Less than 24 hours after her fellow soldiers took off from Hunter Army Airfield, Hutchinson turned herself in and was arrested by military police. No charges have been filed. More than 30,000 single mothers have served in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, according to a new report compiled by the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. Former Air Force JAG Officer Michelle McCleur said Hutchinson is not likely to win a legal battle with the Army. ""When soldiers are ordered to deploy, and single soldiers included, they have to have a family care plan in place ... and they need to implement that,"" she said. CNN's Brian Todd and Campbell Brown contributed to this report .","Spc. Alexis Hutchinson refuses deployment orders to stay with son .

"(CNN) -- The number of people worldwide without access to a toilet -- no public restroom, no outhouse, no latrine, no smallest room -- is a whopping 2.6 billion. That's four out of ten people. The bucket toilet is the only thing on offer for millions of black South Africans. According to the World Toilet Organization, 2.2 million people, predominantly children, die every year from diarrhea -- more than from malaria, from AIDS, from TB. That number dwarfs any casualties related to violent conflict. These figures are intrinsically related. The underestimation of fecal contamination is staggering, sobering -- and unfortunately, silencing. Singaporean social-entrepreneur Jack Sim founded the non-profit World Toilet Organization (""the other WTO"") in 2001, as a support network for all existing organizations. It now includes 151 members from 53 countries, which meet once a year to network, discuss sanitation issues and work together toward ""eliminating the toilet taboo and delivering sustainable sanitation."" Goal number one: Making sanitation speakable. ""What we don't discuss, we can't improve,"" insists Sim. This year, the World Toilet Summit & Expo 2008 was held from November 4-6 in Macau under the theme ""Driving Sustainable Sanitation through Market-Based Initiatives."" Indeed, not only is sanitation a good idea, it's a good investment. Biosolids can be composted into fertilizer, sewage can be processed into methane biogas, and even simple latrines in India are producing compost and fertilizer. ""Globally, if universal sanitation were achieved by 2015, it would cost $95 billion, but it would save $660 billion,"" writes Rose George in her newly released book ""The Big Necessity."" Real-world examples follow: ""When Peru had a cholera outbreak in 1991, it cost $1 billion to contain but could have been prevented with $100 million of better sanitation measures."" Or even more alarming: ""Pakistan, for example, spends 47 times more on its military budget than on water and sanitation, though it loses 120,000 people to diarrhea a year."" So while 2.6 billion people have no toilet, how many millions of us simply ""flush and forget""? Eco-sanitation, or the problem of dealing efficiently and ecologically with sewer systems, wastewater, treatment and purification, is no less a serious one. In the UK alone, the sewage system emits some 28.8 million tons of carbon dioxide a year. As sewers become overloaded with urban development, drought strikes various regions of the earth, and potable water becomes increasingly scarce, even the flush toilet is now put into question. Today, those who care are looking at innovative toilet and waste-disposal solutions from India, China and other parts of the developing world, where attitudes and habits are still evolving and open to change. Don't forget, World Toilet Day is November 19.","2.6 billion people have no access to toilet; 2.2 die annually from diarrhea .

"(CNN) -- British boxer Amir Khan has retained his WBA light-welterweight title after winning the much-hyped ""battle of the faiths"" by stopping challenger Dmitriy Salita in the first round on Saturday night. Khan, a devout Muslim, knocked down his Jewish opponent three times before the referee stopped after just one minute and 16 seconds. Salita, an American citizen who was born in Ukraine and is nicknamed ""Star of David"", was unable to follow up his bold claims made in the build-up to the fight, which took place in Newcastle in the north-east of England. The 22-year-old Khan was successful in his first defense of the belt that he won in defeating Andreas Kotelnik in July. He is trained by American Freddie Roach, who also guides Filipino star Manny Pacquiao, considered by many to be the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world. ""It was very explosive. The fight was just what we asked for, what Freddie asked me to do. We had too much power for this guy,"" a delighted Khan told reporters after the fight. ""I'm a growing young man and developing as a man. Freddie said to take it easy, pick the right shots and you'll take this guy out and we did. ""Freddie is a great trainer, he's like a father figure to me and to have him in my corner means a lot. Everyone knows I'm a hard-working fighter and if you put the hard work in you're going to get the benefits. ""After the first shot I could see his legs buckling and I just had to take my time. I knew he was going."" Roach has helped the Olympic silver medal winner to rebuild his career after a humiliating defeat by unknown Colombian Breidis Prescott last year. ""It was a blessing in disguise what happened against Prescott, I got beat and came back stronger,"" Khan said. Roach was equally impressed with his young charge. ""I would give him an A+. I said if you hurt him, finish him. We've been working on that power and the fight was really over after that first punch,"" he said.","British boxer Amir Khan retains his WBA light-welterweight title in his first defense .

"(CNN) -- The Beatles first appeared on ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" 44 years ago. It's also been 44 years since the Beatles held the five top positions of the Billboard pop chart, a feat never achieved before -- or since. Ringo Starr wishes peace and love to everyone following Larry King singing ""Happy Birthday"" to him. But no time has passed since one of the Beatles, Ringo Starr, was playing up on stage. The drummer's 68th birthday Monday coincided with his 10th ""Ringo Starr and his All Stars"" tour. In honor of the day, he asked people to take a moment at noon for peace and love. Thousands joined him in Chicago to do just that. He also celebrated his birthday on ""Larry King Live,"" talking with King about Beatlemania, his new album and the tour. The following is an edited version of the interview: . KING: How did you come up with the idea [of peace and love]? RINGO STARR: Oh it came in a dream -- flaming pie. It's just -- I just thought it would be a nice thing when, you know, because it's my birthday and I'm on tour, everybody is saying what do you want for your birthday? So I thought well, why not at noon doesn't everybody go ""peace and love""?  Watch people celebrate Starr's birthday in London » . KING: That was something the Beatles were always concerned with, weren't they, those kind of themes? STARR: Well, yes. It was part of our generation, of the '60s -- middle '60s, of course and, you know, with flower power and peace and love and that -- I'm just keeping it rolling. That's what I'm doing. KING: Why do you perform? STARR: I perform because that's what I do. When I was 13, the dream was to be a drummer. I didn't want to be a guitarist or anything else. I wanted to be a drummer. That happened. I started playing with local musicians and I always wanted to play with the best musicians around. I ended up in the biggest band in the world with the best musicians. I'm still doing it now. The dream unfolds all the time. I love to play. I love to perform. It's a lot of fun, and it just happens to be what I do. KING: But it's never a grind? STARR: No. Hotels are a grind. The traveling's always a grind. The good things that come out of that is that for ... two hours and 15 minutes a night, you get a chance to just have a great time. KING: How is the all-star band picked? STARR: I picked them because the first rule is that you have to have had a hit in the '60s, which I had, '70s, which I had, '80s or '90s. We're the best 1-800-band that goes live. You know, Colin Hay from Men at Work, Edgar Winter, Billy Squier, Gary Wright [with] ""Dream Weaver,"" Hamish [Stuart] from the Average White Band. Everybody on stage has had hits. The thing is, for the summer collectively, we all get together and support each other. I play on all their songs. They play on mine. Some of them I do from the front. I have this other drummer, Greg Bissonette, who is great. He does those and then I get up and play the drums. I win both ways. KING: Your latest CD is ""Liverpool 8,"" and it is probably -- not probably, it's definitely the most personal of your albums. Why did you do it? STARR: You're a writer, I write with friends. People are talking about the actual title track, ""Liverpool 8,"" which was about my life. The first verse, I was a sailor first; I was in the Merchant Navy. I worked in a factory and then I joined Rory Storm and that's when I went professional as a musician, and we played this holiday camp called Butlin's Holiday Camp, and then we went to Hamburg and we ended up in [New York's] Shea [Stadium]. It's like a mini autobiography. I think that's what people are getting to. KING: How did you get to be a Beatle? STARR: I got it because I'm an incredible musician, and I knew the boys, and they gave me -- I was playing with Rory. They gave me a call and said, do you want to join the band. I said, sure. That's how it happened. KING: Did you like that band right off? STARR: No. I liked that band before I was in it. It was the only band I used to go and see in Liverpool. We became friends before that, before I joined. We were all playing in the same venues. Actually, Rory Storm and the Beatles played in Germany together. It wasn't like I was some stranger they called up. KING: Did you like the other drummer? STARR: The other drummer was the other drummer, you know. A lot of water has gone under the bridge. They, for their reasons, decided they wanted a change, and I am the result. KING: How fortunate for everyone. You and Paul McCartney are the two still alive. You were with us last year in Vegas in an extraordinary show. This may be difficult. What was it like to be a Beatle? STARR: Well, it's difficult, because what was it like? I mean, it was incredible. It was hard, because when we started we were a club band and then it got bigger and bigger. Because we were four brothers together, we supported each other. But you cannot not say that it wasn't crazy days and reckless nights. That's what it was. You know, in the end, you know, the one big image that we had, the whole floor of the Plaza [Hotel] in New York and the four of us were hanging out in the bathroom trying to get away from the pressure. KING: Do you still listen to the Beatles? STARR: Yes, of course I do, some great tracks. My iPod is on shuffle. I have Beatle tracks in it. So they come up and, you know, the music is still, you know -- I love the music. KING: Why or how do you explain their long lasting? STARR: Because they were great songs and, you know, we were incredible musicians who gave those songs incredible life. KING: Do you think the Beatles would be a success today? STARR: Sure. KING: Great music is great music. STARR: Hey, I mean, the kids of today don't know us really, but they know the music. You know, they're still listening to it and saying wow! You talk to any new band, most of them have actually had a listen to what we did. KING: Anything you want to do, Ringo, you haven't done? STARR: No, I'm sort of doing enough. It's good. And I'm privileged and blessed that I can do what I want to do, when I want to do it. KING: And it's still -- when you're on that stage, hitting those drums and the band is going -- .

"Durham, North Carolina (CNN) -- To define someone as a looter is not simply to describe him, or her, through an act, it is to make a moral judgment. It is to characterize the person as lawless and criminal. It connotes someone who is without self-restraint; an animal; wanton and depraved. It is a description that is void of empathy for someone who is consciously or subconsciously viewed as ""the other."" Tragically, it fits into the stereotype that many have about people of African descent, be they African-Americans or Haitian-Americans. The news media have to stop describing starving Haitians who are simply trying to survive the earthquake and aftershocks that took their homes, their loved ones, and all their possessions by this highly derogatory term. It's a lesson they should have learned covering the devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina.  I remember the news accounts then that described black residents of New Orleans as ""looters,"" but used benign words to describe white residents engaged in the same action: taking things. Academics have found repeated instances of this in media content analyses after disasters. One example, widely disseminated on the web post-Katrina, juxtaposed an Associated Press photo that showed a young black man wading through chest-high water ""after looting a grocery store"" (said the caption), with an AFP/Getty photo of a white woman in the same position, although the caption this time described her ""finding"" food ""from a local grocery store."" It is time to put this practice to rest. Put yourself in the position of the average Haitian in Port-au-Prince. One minute you were going about your business, the next minute the earth shook and literally your world crumbled all around you. But you were one of the lucky ones, you survived the earthquake. Injured? Yes. But alive. Your first thought is to cry out for your family, especially your kids. But most of your family is buried under a rubble pile somewhere. You had four children but only one survived the earthquake. You have spent the last few days, along with your fellow survivors, digging through the rubble trying to find them. It is now a week after the earthquake, and you have eaten little or nothing. You are hungry and thirsty, and while you hear rumors of aid coming, you have not seen any evidence of it. You have not heard from the president and indeed you've heard rumors that his wife is dead. Perhaps he left the country; you would too, if you could. There is no police presence at all. No governmental authority to provide support. There are no markets. The only money you have are the few gourdes (Haitian dollars) that you have in your pockets. The rest of your money is in the safe place you always kept it -- but it is now buried with your food. The banks are not open. There is no one to borrow from; they are all in the same boat as you. There are no functioning institutions. You have family in the United States and they are desperately trying to get you some help. They have contacted all of the big aid agencies, but those agencies have issues of their own. Some have lost staff members. They are doing the best they can, but they have no idea that you exist and you have no way of finding them. The roads are impassable, and they can't get clearance from whoever is in charge of the airport to land their planes, which bring much needed supplies. They're afraid to go anywhere without security because they've heard that the people are becoming restless. Indeed, though you do not know this, the U.S. military is also worried that citizens will get violent and start stealing. The United Nations is waiting for more troops, and the doctors have stopped treating patients because of those same fears: violence, looting. Under normal circumstances you would not think of taking food without paying for it. You are what other Haitians would call ""bien eleve"" not ""mal eleve."" By that they mean you were well-raised, with manners and dignity. Haitians put a strong premium on dignity. To take something for which you have not paid does not only offend your sense of legality but also your sense of personhood. It is undignified. But not only are you starving, so is your only surviving child. You would prefer to pay, but whom? What would you pay with? You'd prefer to wait, but for whom? How long can you afford to wait? You feel that your desperate state is evidence that you have been abandoned by your family, your country, the international community, and Bondié (God). (The Creole word for God literally means ""good God."") So you take. You take just enough for a couple of days and a couple of family members. You take and you run to feed those for whom the only measure of fortune is survival in Haiti, post-earthquake. You take and you run. Are you a looter? Try as we might to prevent it, the answer to that question is inevitably racialized. We cannot separate the word looting from its racial implications or the supposed crime of looting from its racial origins. In the throes of the civil rights movement in the United States, many states made looting a crime. Almost all of these states were southern states that had a history of criminalizing behavior that they associated more with African-Americans than with whites. Even so, the criminal law, for all of its shortcomings, is often more sophisticated than we are. It recognizes that context matters. It has been developed with concepts -- such as necessity and justification -- to identify the circumstances under which a person who would normally be held culpable can be held either less culpable or not at all culpable. Taking food is different than taking a television. It is past time for our news media to develop similar sophistication. It is time to stop characterizing black people trying to survive in dire circumstances as looters. Are they takers? Yes. Are they looters? Let's wait for a criminal conviction first.

"(CNN) -- Film director Roman Polanski has been released from custody in Switzerland and placed under house arrest, Swiss justice authorities said Friday. Polanski was released ""pending extradition"" to the United States, the Swiss Department of Justice and Police said in a statement. Polanski faces a sex-offense charge from the 1970s that involves a girl who was 13. He is under house arrest at his chalet in Gstaad, Switzerland, the department said. His house has been fitted with an electronic monitoring system that will trigger an alarm if Polanski leaves the premises or removes a bracelet that tracks his movements, the statement said. A judge ruled last week that Polanski could be freed -- under house arrest -- if he posted bail of 4.5 million Swiss francs ($4.5 million). He was moved to an undisclosed location Thursday because of security concerns, Swiss federal police spokesman Falco Galli said. The Oscar-winning director was arrested in Switzerland in September on a U.S. arrest warrant stemming from a 1977 sex case. Polanski, 76, pleaded guilty in August 1977 to having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl five months earlier. He was 43 at the time. Los Angeles, California, prosecutors dropped other charges in exchange for his guilty plea. But Polanski fled the United States before he was sentenced, after he learned that the judge might not go along with the short jail term he expected to get in exchange for his agreement to plead guilty. Polanski remained free, mostly living in France, before his arrest in Switzerland. Los Angeles authorities said they sought his arrest when they learned that he would be traveling to Switzerland for a film festival in September. The victim came forward long ago and made her identity public, saying she was disturbed by how the criminal case had been handled. Samantha Geimer, now 45 and a married mother of three, called in January for the case to be tossed out. Polanski agreed to pay Geimer $500,000 to settle a damage claim she filed against him nearly 12 years after the crime, according to court papers released October 2. Polanski still owed the money -- plus $100,000 in interest -- three years after the 1993 settlement, according to the documents. Geimer sought money for damages suffered when Polanski had sex with her. She claimed that Polanski plied her with alcohol and Quaaludes during a photo shoot at the Hollywood Hills home of actor Jack Nicholson. It's not clear whether Polanski completed paying the debt to Geimer, although the court papers document efforts by her lawyers to garnish residuals and other payments owed to Polanski by the Screen Actors Guild, movie studios and other Hollywood businesses. Among Polanski's film credits are ""The Pianist,"" ""Chinatown,"" ""Repulsion,"" ""Rosemary's Baby,"" ""The Ninth Gate"" and ""Tess.""","NEW: Roman Polanski's house, ankle fitted with monitoring system .

"(CNN) --  There's a lot of head-scratching at the CIA over an article in Vanity Fair magazine that dubs Erik Prince, the founder of the notorious private military contractor Blackwater, a ""tycoon, contractor, soldier, spy."" In the piece, he comes across as so entrenched with the CIA that the agency needs him to perform the most sensitive secret missions, including those involving hunting down and taking out al Qaeda operatives. It's true that Prince, as the sole owner of one of the most well-connected private military contractors in modern history, is in a position of enormous trust within the government. So why is it that he's lashing out publicly at that same government? Prince, a 40-year-old former Navy SEAL, inherited what he called a sizable amount of money when his father died in the late '90s. He's used that money to help climb to the top of an industry that has mushroomed since the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. He built Blackwater, now operating under the name Xe, from the ground up, into a sprawling complex with enough tanks, planes and ammunition to launch a small war of its own. When President Obama addressed the nation and talked about his Afghanistan strategy, he didn't talk about the shadow army already employed there. There are more private contractors in Afghanistan on the U.S. payroll than there are U.S. troops. While Prince is a huge beneficiary of U.S. contract dollars, he has long been frustrated by two things. First, he doesn't like the reputation his company has gained, with his men painted as ruthless cowboys -- which some are, but some aren't. Second, he believes some people in the government just don't appreciate him the way they should. Prince uses the Vanity Fair article to re-air a lot of his complaints, but the story contains a great deal of classified information, with details about covert programs that involved him. So does that mean that when convenient, he uses that information to help express his frustration? Prince unabashedly criticizes parts of the government he doesn't like. And some current and former government sources question whether that's a smart move. They ask whether, as a man who benefits financially from those contracts, he should really go public with his criticisms of the same government that signs his checks. Although the CIA has never publicly confirmed Prince's involvement -- it has become common knowledge in the industry  he disclosed details of that relationship to me, among many other things, in the book I wrote on him that was published earlier this year. A lot of those details came up again in this latest article, but Prince went even further this time. The Vanity Fair article reports that Prince is ""privately and secretly doing the CIA's bidding, helping to craft, fund and execute operations ranging from inserting personnel into ""denied areas,"" places U.S. intelligence has trouble penetrating, to assembling hit teams targeting al Qaeda members and their allies."" Some former CIA officials are, quite frankly, annoyed. Not only do they believe that Prince is overplaying any role he may have had or still has with the agency, but they believe he is exploiting it for personal gain. Few of the sources I talked with wanted their names associated with Prince or his company, but when asked about the Vanity Fair article, CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano told me the agency has never ""talked about what role contractors may or may not have played in ...  initiatives over the years. But what no one should forget or overlook is the fact that this agency has the talent, tools, and authorities to go after terrorists, and has done so successfully."" In other words: We can do our own jobs just fine, thank you very much, Mr. Prince. Another source with former ties to the CIA was outraged by the article, saying that Prince was putting a target on the backs of his own men by alluding to a close relationship between Blackwater and the agency. He fears that all around the world, Blackwater contractors would be perceived as agents of the CIA. A government official who also thought that the article exaggerated Prince's role in the CIA put it this way: . ""Blackwater has good people. They do hard work, sharing the burdens of service overseas. But they're not well-served by strange tales, the kind of stuff you saw in Vanity Fair about miraculous penetrations of hard intelligence targets or private assassination squads with their fingers on the trigger. ""That should all be shelved under fiction, the kind of stories that end with the alarm clock going off and mom calling you down to breakfast,""  the official said. What the article doesn't say is just how much of a PR headache Prince has become. One of the lessons that has come with the marriage between private and military is that for a private business, PR can be crucial to your survival; for a covert operation, it can be deadly. Striking a balance between the two has been the source of much hand-wringing in Washington. But no matter how you feel about private military contracting, it is here to stay. All of the major U.S. agencies -- the State Department, the Department of Defense, the CIA -- do business with Prince, and all are dependent on contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan. I flew with Prince to Afghanistan shortly after the shootings in a Baghdad traffic circle in September of 2007 that killed 17 people. Blackwater guards were accused. Four pleaded not guilty and are awaiting trial; a fifth struck a deal with prosecutors. Prince's frustration was obvious. He felt like he had given everything to his country and that his country had let him down in countless ways; namely by not defending him publicly when his company came under fire after the shootings. Prince says he does what he does for love of country, but of course, he doesn't do it for free. His companies have received well over a billion dollars in the process. I asked his spokesperson to comment on concerns that Prince might be jeopardizing agency programs by going public with the details -- after all, he does have a security clearance. The response was this: ""Truth is he is a quiet hero, a great patriot and American. We need more men like him."" Quiet? Really?

"(CNN) -- They share a deep sorrow: an idealistic American who tried to protect the Kurds of Iraq, a Canadian general who refused to follow orders in Rwanda, a French priest who fought for the soul of Cambodia. CNN's Christiane Amanpour traveled to the killing fields of Europe, Africa and Asia for ""Scream Bloody Murder."" Each one tried to focus the world's attention on the world's most heinous crime: genocide. Each time, they were shunned, ignored or told it was someone else's problem. To understand why, CNN's Christiane Amanpour traveled to the killing fields of Europe, Africa and Asia for a two-hour documentary, ""Scream Bloody Murder."" Having reported on mass atrocities around the world, this time Amanpour traced the personal accounts of those who tried to stop the slaughter. The yearlong CNN investigation found that instead of using a U.N. treaty outlawing genocide as a springboard to action, political leaders have invoked reason after reason to make intervention seem unnecessary, pointless and even counter-productive.  Map: See the locations featured in the documentary » . December marks the 60th anniversary of the U.N.'s Genocide Convention, when -- in the aftermath of the Holocaust -- the nations of the world pledged to prevent and punish future attempts to eliminate ethnic, religious and national groups. Read the 1948 Genocide Convention (pdf) ""The Genocide Convention should have stopped genocide, but it didn't,"" said Holocaust survivor and Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel. Intervention is a daunting challenge, he believes, because of a tendency to minimize accounts from refugees and victims. ""It's better not to believe, because if you believe, you don't sleep nights. And how can you eat? How can you drink a glass of wine when you know?""  See images from locations in the documentary » . 1970s: Cambodia . Father François Ponchaud was a Catholic missionary in Cambodia when the Khmer Rouge guerillas -- communist revolutionaries -- seized power in 1975. They expelled all foreigners from the country. But working from France, Ponchaud gathered refugee accounts and monitored radio broadcasts to document the slave labor, torture and executions the Khmer Rouge were using to kill one-fourth of Cambodia's population. He published his findings in a major French newspaper and wrote a book, ""Year Zero."" But even so, Ponchaud tells Amanpour, ""No one believed us.""  Watch a behind-the-scenes look at the making of 'Scream Bloody Murder' » . 1980s: Iraq . CNN found that intervention is often weighed against political and economic costs. Declassified U.S. government documents show that while Saddam Hussein was gassing Iraqi Kurds, the U.S. opposed punishing Iraq with a trade embargo because it was cultivating Iraq as an ally against Iran and as a market for U.S. farm exports. According to Peter Galbraith, then an idealistic Senate staffer determined to stop Hussein from committing genocide, the Reagan administration ""got carried away with their own propaganda. They began to believe that Saddam Hussein could be a reliable partner."" Read once-secret U.S. documents . 1990s: Bosnia . Even extensive news coverage may not lead to intervention. During the violent breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, the media reported on the Bosnian Serbs' ethnic cleansing of Muslims: the siege of Sarajevo, the concentration camps, the use of rape as a weapon of war. It was like watching ""a color remake of the black-and-white scenes we'd seen in World War II,"" said U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke, whose Jewish grandfather fled Germany when Adolf Hitler came to power. Holbrooke was an early advocate for a U.S.-led military operation against the Bosnian Serbs. ""I took a stand that I believed was correct,"" he told Amanpour. ""I didn't think it was so controversial."" But it would take three years -- and the massacre of 8,000 Muslim men and boys in the town of Srebrenica -- for Holbrooke to make his case within the Clinton administration. 1994: Rwanda . In Rwanda, where Hutu soldiers and militias massacred their Tutsi countrymen, the Clinton administration tried to avoid characterizing the ethnic slaughter as genocide. According to an internal memo, the State Department worried that under the 1948 Genocide Convention, using the term ""genocide"" could force the U.S. ""to actually 'do something.'"" The head of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Rwanda, Canadian Lt. Gen. Romeo Dallaire, begged for additional troops. Instead of reinforcements, Dallaire got an order to withdraw completely. He would not leave Rwanda. ""I refused a legal order,"" he told Amanpour, ""but it was immoral."" His tiny U.N. force was not enough to stop the slaughter of more than 800,000 people. 2003: Darfur . Some human rights advocates consider Darfur, the western region of Sudan, to be the scene of the first genocide of the 21st century. The atrocities in Darfur grow out of a civil war between rebels from Sudan's African tribes and the country's Arab-led government. In 2003, when the rebels attacked government outposts in Darfur, a U.N. human rights monitor warned that in the ""escalating conflict,"" Sudan's government may be ""engaged in ... ethnic cleansing aimed at eliminating African tribes from Darfur."" At the time, world attention was on Iraq, where the United States was fighting to overthrow Saddam Hussein. The early warning on Darfur ""disappeared into a big hole,"" according to Mukesh Kapila, then the U.N.'s top official in Sudan. Even when the U.N. Security Council put Darfur on its agenda, it took more than three years to authorize a robust peacekeeping force. ""There was no lack of information,"" says activist Eric Reeves. ""There was a lack of will to stop genocide."" In July, the prosecutor at the International Criminal Court accused Sudan's president of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, charges Sudan denies. Read the ICC prosecutor's charges (pdf) How will history judge the world's response to Darfur? ""It will applaud the young people ... who believe in solidarity,"" says Wiesel. ""It will certainly criticize the leaders of the world."" And the next time somebody screams bloody murder to stop a genocide, will anyone listen?

"Editor's note: Junot Díaz's novel ""The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao"" won the Pulitzer Prize in 2008. (OPRAH.com) -- It wasn't that I couldn't write. I wrote every day. I actually worked really hard at writing. At my desk by 7 a.m., would work a full eight and more. Scribbled at the dinner table, in bed, on the toilet, on the No. 6 train, at Shea Stadium. I did everything I could. But none of it worked. My novel, which I had started with such hope shortly after publishing my first book of stories, wouldn't budge past the 75-page mark. Nothing I wrote past page 75 made any kind of sense. Nothing. Which would have been fine if the first 75 pages hadn't been pretty damn cool. But they were cool, showed a lot of promise. Would also have been fine if I could have just jumped to something else. But I couldn't. All the other novels I tried sucked worse than the stalled one, and even more disturbing, I seemed to have lost the ability to write short stories. It was like I had somehow slipped into a No-Writing Twilight Zone and I couldn't find an exit. Like I'd been chained to the sinking ship of those 75 pages and there was no key and no patching the hole in the hull. I wrote and I wrote and I wrote, but nothing I produced was worth a damn. Want to talk about stubborn? I kept at it for five straight years. Five damn years. Every day failing for five years? I'm a pretty stubborn, pretty hard-hearted character, but those five years of fail did a number on my psyche. On me. Five years, 60 months? It just about wiped me out. By the end of that fifth year, perhaps in an attempt to save myself, to escape my despair, I started becoming convinced that I had written all I had to write, that I was a minor league Ralph Ellison, a Pop Warner Edward Rivera, that maybe it was time, for the sake of my mental health, for me to move on to another profession, and if the inspiration struck again some time in the future...well, great. But I knew I couldn't go on much more the way I was going. I just couldn't. I was living with my fiancée at the time (over now, another terrible story) and was so depressed and self-loathing I could barely function. I finally broached the topic with her of, maybe, you know, doing something else. My fiancée was so desperate to see me happy (and perhaps more than a little convinced by my fear that maybe the thread had run out on my talent) that she told me to make a list of what else I could do besides writing. I'm not a list person like she was, but I wrote one. It took a month to pencil down three things. (I really don't have many other skills.) I stared at that list for about another month. Waiting, hoping, praying for the book, for my writing, for my talent to catch fire. A last-second reprieve. But nada. So I put the manuscript away. All the hundreds of failed pages, boxed and hidden in a closet. I think I cried as I did it. Five years of my life and the dream that I had of myself, all down the tubes because I couldn't pull off something other people seemed to pull off with relative ease: a novel. By then I wasn't even interested in a Great American Novel. I would have been elated with the eminently forgettable New Jersey novel. Oprah.com: The real meaning of your ""true calling"" So I became a normal. A square. I didn't go to bookstores or read the Sunday book section of the Times. I stopped hanging out with my writer friends. The bouts of rage and despair, the fights with my fiancée ended. I slipped into my new morose half-life. Started preparing for my next stage, back to school in September. (I won't even tell you what I was thinking of doing, too embarrassing.) While I waited for September to come around, I spent long hours in my writing room, sprawled on the floor, with the list on my chest, waiting for the promise of those words to leak through the paper into me. Maybe I would have gone through with it. Hard to know. But if the world is what it is so are our hearts. One night in August, unable to sleep, sickened that I was giving up, but even more frightened by the thought of having to return to the writing, I dug out the manuscript. I figured if I could find one good thing in the pages I would go back to it. Just one good thing. Like flipping a coin, I'd let the pages decide. Spent the whole night reading everything I had written, and guess what? It was still terrible. In fact with the new distance the lameness was even worse than I'd thought. That's when I should have put everything in the box. When I should have turned my back and trudged into my new life. I didn't have the heart to go on. But I guess I did. While my fiancée slept, I separated the 75 pages that were worthy from the mountain of loss, sat at my desk, and despite every part of me shrieking no no no no, I jumped back down the rabbit hole again. There were no sudden miracles. It took two more years of heartbreak, of being utterly, dismayingly lost before the novel I had dreamed about for all those years finally started revealing itself. And another three years after that before I could look up from my desk and say the word I'd wanted to say for more than a decade: done. Oprah.com: 4 writers answer ""What makes you you?"" That's my tale in a nutshell. Not the tale of how I came to write my novel but rather of how I became a writer. Because, in truth, I didn't become a writer the first time I put pen to paper or when I finished my first book (easy) or my second one (hard). You see, in my view a writer is a writer not because she writes well and easily, because she has amazing talent, because everything she does is golden. In my view a writer is a writer because even when there is no hope, even when nothing you do shows any sign of promise, you keep writing anyway. Wasn't until that night when I was faced with all those lousy pages that I realized, really realized, what it was exactly that I am. Oprah.com: 11 ways to find your calling .

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- The former accountant for Andrew Joseph ""Joe"" Stack III -- who officials say flew his plane into a Texas building housing an Internal Revenue Service office -- says Stack had never threatened him, a spokesman for the accountant said. CPA Bill Ross was mentioned in a 3,000-word message on a Web site registered to Stack, which railed against the government, particularly the IRS. The online message believed to have been written by Stack criticizes accountant Ross for ""representing himself and not me."" Ross had not heard from Stack since October, when his client ""disengaged"" services in a letter, spokesman Chad Wilbanks told CNN. According to Ross, Stack had not expressed any threats toward the accountant or the IRS, Wilbanks said. ""Mr. Stack contacted my firm to help with his personal taxes in 2008. He failed to provide me with all his income and other information resulting in an IRS audit,"" Ross said in a written statement Saturday. ""Unfortunately, Mr. Stack ignored the audit and my advice which only complicated his situation, at which time our firm disengaged our services with Mr. Stack whom we have not been in contact with since October 2009."" Ross did not provide any further details in the statement on his work with Stack. Wilbanks said Ross, who has worked as a CPA for at least 30 years, thinks Stack located him in the phone book. They only met four times and did not have a personal relationship, Wilbanks said. The FBI has taken over the investigation into the crash, and Ross has spoken to investigators, Wilbanks said. While Ross does not fear for his safety, he has ""taken precautions,"" though those steps were not detailed by Wilbanks. The online message, in a hit to the IRS, states, ""I saw it written once that the definition of insanity is repeating the same process over and over and expecting the outcome to suddenly be different. ""I am finally ready to stop this insanity. Well, Mr. Big Brother IRS man, let's try something different; take my pound of flesh and sleep well."" Read the apparent suicide note (PDF) The seven-story building attacked in northwest Austin held offices for nearly 200 IRS workers. Two people were killed and two others were hospitalized when Stacks crashed his plane into the building Thursday, federal officials said. One of the injured, Shane Hill, announced his release from the hospital Saturday. ""I am very grateful to the first responders who were there to assist me, and to those who have cared for me in San Antonio,"" Hill said in a written statement. ""I am so blessed to be home today, and I ask for your courtesy and our privacy as my family and I focus on making a quick and full recovery."" Though the remains of two people found in the IRS building have been identified, their identities will not be revealed until after a forensic examination, said Ralph Diaz, special agent in charge of the FBI's San Antonio field office. Watch one of crash victim's sons say he's ""still a little shocked"" Agents were looking into whether the seats of the plane were removed to accommodate a fuel drum in an effort to cause maximum damage, an official familiar with the investigation said Friday. The official, who could not speak on the record because of the ongoing investigation, said the Piper Cherokee PA-28 had several seats removed and a fuel drum was missing from the airport Stack took off from. The single-engine plane has a fuel tank capacity of 38 gallons and is equipped with four seats, according to the Web site risingup.com. Authorities say Stack also torched his $230,000 home in Austin on Thursday morning before embarking on his fatal flight. Stack's wife, Sheryl Stack, expressed her ""sincere sympathy to the victims and their families"" in a statement read by family friend Rayford Walker on Friday. Like Ross, friends and former colleagues said they had no inkling of the rage apparently building inside Stack. ""He hid that very well,"" said Billy Eli, in whose band Stack played bass until a few years ago. ""Obviously he was in some serious distress and had some real despair. I never saw that.""

"Dallas, Texas (CNN) -- Two men were arrested and charged Sunday in connection with a string of deliberately set church fires in east Texas, authorities said. Jason Robert Bourque, 19, and Daniel George McAllister, 21, were charged with one count of arson each in a February 8 fire set at the Dover Baptist Church in Tyler, Texas, according to the state Department of Public Safety. Authorities say they believe the men are connected to nine other church fires that have been set in the area since January 1. Bourque and McAllister also are suspects in the attempted break-ins at three separate churches earlier this month, said Steve McCraw, director of the public safety department. A federal law enforcement source told CNN that multiple pieces of evidence have been linked to one of the suspects through DNA and that many of the fires were ignited the same way. ""East Texans can rest easier tonight,"" McCraw said at a news conference announcing the arrests. He called the arsons ""despicable and cowardly acts."" A call to a tip hot line led to the arrests, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which was offering a $25,000 reward for information about the fires. Investigators were first made aware of the suspects about two weeks ago and had been trying to build a case against them since then, ATF Special Agent Thomas Crowley said. Authorities have been interviewing them since their arrest but there's still no information on motive, Crowley said. Authorities on February 12 released sketches of three people sought in connection with the fires. On Sunday, officials said that those ""persons of interest"" are not related to this weekend's arrests. An 11th church arson in Temple, Texas, is not related to the other 10, said Robert Champion of the ATF in Dallas, Texas. Earlier this month, authorities said they were trying to determine whether the Temple fire was connected to the others. CNN's Ed Lavandera contributed to this report.","NEW: Call to a tip hot line led to the arrests, ATF says .

"Long Beach, California (CNN) -- Moments after marine explorer Sylvia Earle finished her passionate plea to preserve vast stretches of the world's oceans at last year's TED conference, a foundation executive walked up to her and pledged a million dollars for the cause. It was one of nearly 400 offers of support Earle received after revealing the wish she wanted to be granted as a winner of the TED Prize, given by the nonprofit organization whose motto is ""Ideas worth spreading."" It grants the winners $100,000 and organizational support but the impact of the prize is typically magnified by the backing of the influential audience attending the conferences. On Wednesday, British celebrity chef and nutrition advocate Jamie Oliver will reveal his wish as the winner of the 2010 prize. ""Every year we're looking around for someone who can inspire the world to do something big and interesting,"" says Chris Anderson, who runs  TED with the title of curator. ""The issue of obesity, both in the US and worldwide, is a big deal, a shocking problem in a world where you've got a lot of people starving and a lot of people killing themselves by overeating... or eating the wrong things. We were interested in finding an inspirational figure who could address that."" Past TED prizes have gone to former President Bill Clinton, rock star and philanthropist Bono and biologist E.O. Wilson. Since 2005, TED has granted wishes to three people a year and continues to work with past winners on achieving their wishes. But this year, the only winner will be Oliver, who has built an empire of cooking shows, cookbooks and restaurants. Oliver, the 34-year-old son of the owners of a pub/restaurant in Essex, England, came to public attention when he starred in a BBC television series, ""The Naked Chef."" He has followed that up with many other series, including one on nutrition in America due to launch this spring on ABC. The chef branched out into advocacy with a ""Feed Me Better"" campaign for improved school lunches in the U.K. He presented a petition with more than 270,000 signatures to the prime minister's residence at 10 Downing Street in 2005, and officials promised to spend an added 280 million pounds ($437 million) to improve school food quality. TED Prize winners typically keep their wishes secret until the conference. Anderson told CNN last week that he did not know what Oliver's wish is. ""The whole idea is that the winner can actually wish for anything. We're taking a bit of a gamble here, for all we know he could wish for a hot tub full of models."" The suspense is ""part of the magical nature of the prize ... that moment of unveiling is special and it excites people."" Oliver's not tipping his hand about his wish, saying  -- through a spokesman -- ""I humbly but passionately hope that my wish and my speech will inspire everyone in the room -- and watching on the Internet -- to take action on an issue that affects the whole world."" TED began in the 1980s as a conference in California focusing on technology, entertainment and design but has since expanded to include virtually any subject and conferences in other locations. Speakers, dressed informally, prowl a big stage -- there's no lectern -- and present their views as a clock ticks away the 18 minutes each is allotted. This year's conference in Long Beach, California, with 1,500 people attending in person and 500 watching a simulcast at the TEDActive conference in Palm Springs, features Bill Gates, Sheryl Crow, Sarah Silverman, James Cameron, David Byrne and Eve Ensler, among a roster of speakers in fields such as technology, science, philosophy, art, music and design. Anderson, who built and eventually sold a magazine publishing empire in the 1980s and 1990s, first attended a TED conference in 1998 and was intrigued that many people said it was the highlight of their year. He acquired TED in 2001 and hosted his first conference in 2003. Three years later, TED began posting videos of its talks on the Web.

With the TED Prize, the organization goes beyond simply spreading ideas. ""Whenever I've been to TED, I've been struck by how towards the end of the conference, you had a room full of influential connected people absolutely burning with the possibility of inspiration, and it felt like something could be done with that,"" Anderson said. After a brainstorming session with participants, the idea of a TED Prize emerged, ""a prize that instead of looking back, it looked forward. You brought someone to the conference and instead of just honoring them, you granted them a wish, a chance to make a difference in the world, a wish without restrictions."" Amy Novogratz, director of the TED Prize, said the year after biologist E.O. Wilson wished for a database to document every species on earth, the organization helped launch the ""Encyclopedia of Life."" ""Bono, the humanitarian rock star, won in 2005,"" Novogratz said, ""and wished for a million Americans to sign up to say that they care about poverty in Africa. With Bono and his organization we launched one.org, and he delivered a petition to the G8 that summer with almost 2 million signatures."" Sylvia Earle, the marine biologist, has led dozens of expeditions, including an all-female team that lived for weeks underwater in 1970. She also walked on the sea floor untethered at a lower depth than any other woman. In her talk last year, she pointed out that in the past 50 years, 90 percent of the big fish in the oceans have been consumed and nearly half of the ocean's coral reefs have disappeared. Less than one percent of the ocean is protected from destructive fishing, and Earle believes the seas will go into irreversible decline unless a much larger portion - some experts say as much as 30 percent - is protected. Earle said the world needs to act swiftly to protect what she calls ""the blue heart of the planet that basically keeps us alive."" She told CNN in an interview that a major public awareness campaign will be launched this year and that plans are underway for a conference at sea to get ""influential people to use their talents and intellect to come up with new ways to address these problems."" Earle attributes these initiatives to the involvement of TED. ""It allows us to tap into individuals and organizations all over the world that I wouldn't be able to do as an individual,"" she said. ""They create this awareness and they frame the issues in such a way that people get it and they're inspired to help. And that is a true gift.

"(CNN) -- Several weeks ago, President Obama announced that $8 billion in government-loan guarantees would be made available to Southern Co. to begin construction of two nuclear reactors in Georgia. If built, it would be the first nuclear power plant constructed in the United States in almost 30 years. More importantly, this would be the first of what is expected to be many such projects initiated in coming years. I am a big believer in the necessity for energy independence. I accept that we will all have to make some compromises in achieving that goal. I am willing to consider that nuclear power may have to be one piece of the plan we put together for how to break ourselves free from our dependence on foreign oil. I would submit, however, that before we start building reactors we need to address another urgent matter. We need to make current reactors secure. Roughly 18 months ago I started work on a project that ultimately lead to the writing of my recently published book, ""Willful Neglect,"" on homeland security in the United States. I examined security at a wide range of potential targets inside the United States, including chemical plants, liquefied natural gas facilities, biological research laboratories and nuclear power plants. This was not a theoretical study. I did my homework up front, but after that, I went out on the street and I did what my 20 years in the CIA had trained me to do. I looked at all these targets in the same way as an adversary would. What I found was deeply disturbing. Eight years after 9/11, we had done little or nothing to enhance security in most areas. Nuclear power plants were no exception. Security at nuclear power plants is in the hands of private security companies hired to protect the facilities by the power companies that own them. Before 9/11, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission mandated that there would be five to 10 private security guards on duty at each site per shift. After 9/11 that number was increased. On average, there are now a total of 20 such security personnel on duty at any one time to guard a nuclear power plant. That is 20 individuals to secure the entire perimeter and interior of what may be a vast facility. These guards are grossly underpaid. In many cases, they make less than the janitors at the facilities in question. They train with their weapons no more than two to three times a year. Some of them are prior military and have combat experience. Many others are hired off the street and given less than a week's worth of training before they begin to stand post. Much of that week of training is consumed with administrative matters, which have nothing to do with learning how to repel a terrorist attack. Morale among the guards at nuclear power plants is chronically low. I was told by many individuals during my research that it was common to hear discussions among guards about where they would hide if there were an attack. These guard forces are typically trained to respond to a limited number of scenarios. These scenarios are always designed around attacks by very small numbers and are artificially constrained so as to not allow these attackers to use many weapons, such as rocket launchers and machine guns, commonly in use by terrorist groups today. Even so, the guard forces are defeated at least half the time. These deficiencies have been pointed out for years by any number of watchdog organizations. Likewise, detailed recommendations have been put forth regarding how to improve the situation and increase the size and ability of power plant guard forces. These include requiring them to demonstrate the capacity to repel attacks by teams of terrorists using the weapons and tactics commonly in use around the world today. These have been largely ignored. An interest in nuclear power plants by al Qaeda or another terrorist group is not theoretical. Among the targets considered for the 9/11 attacks were nuclear power plants. Yemeni security forces recently captured a suspected member of al Qaeda, a New Jersey native named Sharif Mobley. Between 2002 and 2008, he worked at several U.S. nuclear power plants. It does not take a counterterrorism expert to imagine what al Qaeda might be able to do with the knowledge supplied by an individual who had spent the better part of six years inside nuclear facilities. The stakes here are enormous. A team of terrorists, which was able to seize control of a nuclear power plant, could cause it to melt down with relatively basic knowledge of the plant's operation. A full-scale meltdown of a major reactor would be catastrophic. Such an incident at the Indian Point Plant in New York state, for instance, would likely render large parts of the metropolitan New York City area uninhabitable for decades and likely kill tens of thousands. We have neglected this issue for too long. It needs to be addressed, and the decision to push the building of reactors simply adds urgency. Before we move ahead with any new nuclear power plants, let's attend to unfinished business and fix security at the ones we have. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Charles S. Faddis.","Obama administration is backing expansion of nuclear power .

"London, England (CNN) -- Sherlock Holmes the movie has already made more than $300 million at the box office worldwide and British tourism officials are hoping it means money for them too. Britain's tourism board has been promoting films for the past 15 years, so they know just how lucrative a movie like ""Sherlock Homes"" can be. ""To give you an example of a typical blockbuster film, it is normally seen by about 120 million people in the first three weeks of opening,"" Visit Britain official Laurence Bresh told CNN. ""Even if a small percentage of those come to visit Britain as a result of this particular film, that's going to have a huge boost in some of those tourism attractions featured in our promotion."" As much of ""Sherlock Holmes"" is set in London this means big business for museum officials and gift shop operators. The Sherlock Holmes Museum at 221b Baker Street is the address where the fictional detective lived, according to the stories by Conan Doyle. Nearby, a nine-foot statue of Holmes greets visitors at the Baker Street Underground station. Inside the museum, visitors can check out Holmes' study, sit in his armchair by the fireside, examine his calabash pipe and observe his chemistry equipment. ""I think Hollywood has put its magic touch on the legend, and they've put, as it were, a magnifying glass over the character and of course things you could say are slightly exaggerated, but that's the wont of Hollywood and that's what makes these blockbusters successful,"" John Riley, Assistant Curator of the Sherlock Holmes Museum said. ""So any new perspective, any new angle always just helps to perpetuate the legend of Sherlock Holmes. And that indirectly will obviously benefit the museum."" About 70,000 visitors a year stop by the Victorian lodging house, though officials are expecting a spike of interest fueled by the new movie. While thousands of tourists flock to visit the museum, many of its visitors are unaware that Sherlock Holmes was actually not real person. ""A few people do think he is a real character, particularly with the tour of his house on 'Baker Street' adding fuel to the fire so to speak,"" Mark Di-Toro from Visit Britain said. ""That is just testament to Doyle's brilliant writing with his true to nature locations in the books meaning tourist can really relate and visit all the fantastic locations."" A.

"(CNN) -- Portugal declared three days of national mourning Monday amid fears the death toll from devastating floods and mudslides on the island of Madeira could rise above 42. Search teams have been working to find more victims after floodwaters caused by heavy rains swamped the capital Funchal, unleashing a torrent of mud that swept away homes, roads and trees. At least 120 people were injured. Rescuers were trying to drain a two-story undergound car park at a shopping center where many people are thought to have become trapped. Rescuers feared were that when rains started on Saturday many people may have rushed to retrieve their cars, but ended up trapped in the car park, CNN's Portuguese affiliate, RTP state TV, reported. Flags were flying at half staff on government buildings in Lisbon in respect of the victims. European Commission President Jose Manuel Durao Barroso was due there later Monday to give a news conference describing what assistance the European Union can offer to Portugal. Madeira-born footballer Cristiano Ronaldo also paid tribute to the victims as his team Real Madrid played Villarreal on Sunday. He lifted his jersey after scoring a goal to reveal a white T-shirt with ""Madeira"" written on it. Ronaldo wrote on his blog later that he was ""incredulous, shocked and dismayed"" by the disaster, and offered his assistance. The mayor of Funchal, Miguel Alburquerque, has warned it was ""very probable"" the toll will rise. ""Our main concern is for the damaged and flooded homes, the cars buried and swept away by water, where we fear we will find new bodies,"" he told the Jornal de Madeira newspaper, according to Agence France-Presse. Rescuers were still hunting for other people believed missing in the deluge as efforts to clear up got under way. Authorities said about 250 people had been evacuated to military bases and other safe locations. Pedro Barbosa of the Civil Protection Agency told CNN all the damage occurred in just a few hours Saturday morning due to ""very concentrated, very intense"" rains that sparked flooding and mudslides. The mudslides and flooding damaged roads and homes in Funchal, and in Ribeira Brava, which are both on the southern portion of the Atlantic island. Madeira, an autonomous region of Portugal, is a popular resort destination. There have been no reports of any dead or missing tourists. Barbosa said Saturday's heavy rains were the worst in Madeira since 1993, when a storm killed eight people. Madeira is one of the Madeira Islands, an archipelago about 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) southwest of the Portuguese mainland. CNN's Al Goodman contributed to this report.","Portugal announces three days of mourning to victims of floods on island of Madeira .

"NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- Heavy rains triggered by El Nino weather patterns could potentially prove devastating for east African nations that have been water-starved for months, the United Nations has warned. A Turkana boy holds an empty cup in a village in northwestern Kenya. Kenya, Somalia, Tanzania and Uganda are facing mudslides, crop destruction, waterborne diseases and disrupted road networks, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said Friday. Djibouti, Eritrea and Ethiopia could also be affected. The effects of flooding are expected to be exacerbated because so much greenery has disappeared in the drought. ""More than 23 million people in pastoral, agricultural and suburban communities, as well as internally displaced people and refugees in the region, are reeling from the impact of water and food shortages, pasture scarcity, conflict and insecurity,"" said John Holmes, the under-secretary general for humanitarian affairs who is coordinating emergency relief operations. ""While we cannot prevent these climatic shocks, we certainly can mitigate their disastrous effects through forward planning and the right funding from the donor community,"" he said. Uganda, hit by El Nino a decade ago, is planning to apply some of the lessons learned this time around, said Fred Opolot, a government spokesman. ""The government has allocated funds and resources to areas that will be affected,"" he said. ""Our disaster preparedness department is using press briefings, among other ways, to inform the public."" Though the department is not very well-funded, he said, the government is working with groups such as the United Nations and international aid agencies to prepare for floods. ""It is a multifaceted effort ... we want to ensure citizens are sensitized to the dangers of El Nino and things such as bridges are in good condition."" The rainy season begins in the Horn of Africa in mid-October and runs through the end of the year. Meteorologists have forecasted that this year's rains will be more intense than usual because of the El Nino phenomenon, caused by a rise in temperature in the Pacific and Indian oceans. Aid agencies are already buckling under the weight of helping millions of people who have suffered through months of failed crops, drought and erratic rains caused by climate change. In Somalia, 450,000 people in the Juba and Shabelle river basins could suffer, the United Nations estimates. In neighboring Kenya, some 750,000 people -- 150,000 of whom are refugees -- could be affected. The Turkana, a pastoral tribe in northeastern Kenya, is already reeling from a severe drought that has left scores of people dead and remains of skeletal cows strewn across the flat, arid land. The remote region has no access to resources, making it especially vulnerable to natural disasters such as floods. CNN's Moni Basu and Faith Karimi contributed to this report.","U.N. humanitarian agency: East African nations facing flooding, mudslides .

"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- A 15-year-old boy who was burned over 65 percent of his body in October, allegedly by a group of teenagers he knew, has been readmitted to a Miami hospital after he had trouble breathing, a hospital spokeswoman said Monday. Michael Brewer ""had complications with his breathing and is now back in the ICU,"" said Lorraine Nelson, spokeswoman for Jackson Memorial Hospital. Brewer was admitted to Jackson Memorial's Holtz Children's Hospital on Sunday night and is in serious condition, she said. It was not known whether Brewer's condition was related to his severe burns. He was released from Jackson Memorial's burn unit December 22, more than two months after the October 12 incident. ""He had been doing very well. He had been going to physical therapy and doing well, but things happen,"" Nelson told CNN. At the time he was discharged from the burn unit, Dr. Louis Pizano, associate director of the burn center, told reporters, ""From what happened in the beginning, we would have predicted probably six months, at least, in the hospital. And it is miraculous."" Brewer had three skin graft surgeries during his stay in the burn unit and was on a ventilator for almost the entire first month. Three teenagers have been charged as adults with attempted murder in connection with the incident. Detectives said eyewitnesses told them that 16-year-old Jesus Mendez used a lighter to set fire to Brewer after Denver Jarvis, 15, allegedly poured alcohol over him, and that Matthew Bent, also 15, allegedly encouraged the attack. Detectives said Mendez admitted that he set Brewer on fire and that he made a ""bad decision,"" according to an arrest transcript. The three face a maximum sentence of up to 30 years in prison if convicted. Two other boys who were allegedly involved, a 13-year-old and 15-year-old, have not been charged in the attack. A court-appointed psychologist who examined two of the five boys allegedly involved in the attack told CNN they are competent to proceed and assist their attorney. Detectives believe that Brewer owed Bent $40 for a video game. When Brewer did not pay, police said, Bent stole Brewer's father's bicycle, then was arrested when Brewer reported him to the police. The next day, police believe, the group sought out Brewer. Witnesses reported the group called him ""a snitch"" as they set him on fire. Witnesses have said Brewer jumped into a pool to put out the flames.","Michael Brewer had trouble breathing ""and is now back in the ICU,"" hospital says .

"New York (CNN) -- On the same day he was released from a hospital after undergoing a heart procedure, former President Clinton told reporters he has no plans to slow down. ""I have to keep working -- that's what my life is for,"" he said outside his home in Chappaqua, New York, on Friday. ""You know I was given a good mind, a strong body, a wonderful life and it would be wrong for me not to work."" ""I even did a couple of miles [walking] on the treadmill today,"" he said. On Thursday, Clinton, 63, underwent a procedure at New York-Presbyterian Hospital's Columbia campus to implant two stents in a clogged coronary artery. Clinton has ""no evidence of heart attack or damage to his heart,"" and his prognosis is excellent after undergoing the procedure, according to Dr. Allan Schwartz, the hospital's chief of cardiology. Schwartz said the procedure was ""part of the natural history"" of Clinton's treatment after his 2004 quadruple bypass surgery and ""not a result of either his lifestyle or diet, both of which have been excellent."" Have you gone through heart surgery? Share your story. Clinton called the procedure ""kind of a repair job"" and said he's ""actually doing very well."" He said he began feeling tired around Christmas and traveled several times in recent weeks to Europe and Haiti. ""I didn't really notice it until about four days ago when I felt a little bit of pain in my chest, and I thought I had to check it out,"" he said. Earlier Friday, Clinton, the U.N. special envoy for Haiti, issued a statement marking the passing of one month since a massive earthquake devastated the impoverished nation. He also has visited the island nation twice since the earthquake, a fact he noted on Friday. ""I will continue to work with the Haitian government and people, international donors and multilateral organizations, the Haitian Diaspora, NGOs [nongovernmental organizations], and the international business community to fulfill unmet needs,"" Clinton said in the statement, released Friday. ""Haiti still has a chance to escape the chains of the past and the ruins of the earthquake,"" he said. ""But we all will have to do what we can today."" Clinton said he had helped collect 200,000 donations for Haiti through his partnership with former President George W. Bush -- the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund -- and through the Clinton Foundation Haiti Relief Fund, calling those efforts ""especially impressive."" He said he has helped allocate $7 million in relief. The 7.0-magnitude quake of January 12 leveled most of Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital, killing more than 212,000 people and injuring 300,000, according to Haitian government estimates. It left more than a million homeless. Clinton underwent a procedure called angioplasty, the hospital said, in which a balloon catheter is threaded through an artery to the blocked vessel in the heart. When inflated, the balloon opens the vessel and restores blood flow. Many times, a scaffolding-like structure called a stent is left in place to keep the artery open. How stents open arteries . President Obama called Clinton on Thursday evening and wished him a speedy recovery so he can continue his work on Haiti and other humanitarian efforts, a senior administration official said. Schwartz said Clinton began experiencing ""pressure or constriction"" in his chest several days ago, episodes he described as ""brief in nature but repetitive."" An initial electrocardiogram and blood test showed no evidence of heart attack, Schwartz said. Subsequent pictures of Clinton's arteries revealed that one of the bypass grafts from his 2004 surgery was ""completely blocked,"" prompting the stent procedure, which took about an hour, Schwartz said. Schwartz said Clinton was up and walking about two hours after the surgery. Clinton's daughter, Chelsea, and his wife, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, were with him at the hospital Thursday night, Schwartz said. Hillary Clinton was scheduled to leave Friday on a planned trip to the Middle East, but her departure has been delayed until Saturday, a senior U.S. official said. Bill Clinton has maintained an active schedule since leaving the White House in 2001, devoting much of his time to global philanthropic interests and speeches. Friends have expressed concerns that his ""frenetic pace"" was taking a toll on his health, sources told CNN. Clinton maintained that frenetic schedule all the way up to the surgery, said Terry McAuliffe, a longtime Clinton friend and former chairman of the Democratic National Committee. In fact, as doctors were wheeling Clinton into the operating room, Clinton's phone had to be taken out of his hand, said McAuliffe. ""He was on a conference call dealing with Haiti,"" McAuliffe told CNN Friday morning. ""And I guarantee as soon as he gets back today he's going to be back on the phone. He's passionate about helping the folks down there."" In addition to his trips to Haiti, Clinton attended the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January. David Gergen, CNN senior political analyst, said Clinton was exhausted and had a cold after returning from his second trip to Haiti earlier this month. But Schwartz stressed Thursday that Clinton's lifestyle has nothing to do with his hospitalization. ""He has really toed the line in terms of both diet and exercise,"" Schwartz said, adding that he told Clinton he could be back in the office Monday. Dr. Spencer King, who has not treated Clinton, rejected as outdated suggestions that the former president needs to slow down. ""This is kind of a '50s concept,"" he said Thursday. ""Now we've got a lot of fantastic ways to prevent progression of heart disease -- medications, things that can be done. The outlook for people is totally different."" ""If he slows down, he slows down,"" said King, president of St. Joseph's Heart and Vascular Institute in Atlanta, Georgia. But he added, ""It would be very hard to show any data that would tell you he'll have more trouble if he hangs it up."" Clinton's 2004 surgery was performed at the same hospital where he was admitted Thursday. Doctors in 2005 operated again on Clinton to remove scar tissue and fluid that had built up after his bypass surgery. Schwartz said Thursday that the type of bypass graft used in Clinton's 2004 surgery ""has a 10 [percent] to 20 percent failure rate after five or six years."" King said Thursday's stent procedure may not be the end of Clinton's heart woes. ""The problem there is that that vein graft is developing disease, and sometimes it goes on and develops more,"" he said. ""There's a substantial chance over the next three, four, five years that it could close up again.""

"(CNN)  -- Sarah Palin's most ardent supporters in ""real America"" love to suggest that those of us who don't buy into her shtick fail to grasp why they love her, citing her realness, plain-spokenness and whatever else they can conjure up. Folks, nice try, but as a native Texan, I've seen many politicians and wannabes over the years who had charm, wit, charisma and a twinkle in their eye. Anyone who has listened to the best football coaches the Lone Star State has to offer will tell you that they can persuade a mother and father to send their boy to hell to fetch a glass of ice water and bring him home a better man. They could teach a politician or two how to connect with average Americans. You want a media darling politician with substance? Try the late Gov. Ann Richards, a woman who could cut you deep and beam ear-to-ear with her motherly smile. But unlike Palin, she had a host of strong ideas in her head that actually made sense and appealed to a cross-section of folks. Former Rep. Charlie Wilson, who died this week, was a smooth-talking Texan who loved to party hard. But when it came to politics, he knew how to get things done. The media loved him because he could sit with you and enjoy a beer over barbecue, give them a hilarious quote or two, and explain foreign policy better than Henry Kissinger. Why haven't I cottoned to Palin? Because she portrays herself as a straight-talking politician who wants to lead a movement in the ""Lower 48th"" --  but is nothing more than a political celebrity willing to cash every check she can grab. What truly exposed her for me? It was the ridiculous way she reacted in opposing ways last week to two political heavyweights who used the word ""retard."" When it was reported that President Obama's chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, told a group of liberals that they were ""f-----g retards"" for threatening to run ads against fellow Democrats who weren't jumping on the health care reform bandwagon, Palin demanded his resignation. As the mother of a child with Down syndrome, Palin has often used her bully pulpit to demand respect for the mentally challenged. Nothing wrong with that. It is an issue that is close to her heart, and she should be a fierce advocate for them. Yet when one of her biggest supporters, conservative radio talk-show host Rush Limbaugh, also castigated liberals by calling them ""retards,"" Palin provided him cover, even trying to explain away his comments. In an interview with Fox News Channel's Chris Wallace, she said Limbaugh was using satire, while Emanuel was blasting those who disagree with him. But anyone who can read or listen could hear Limbaugh calling folks he disagrees with the same. Palin even went further, agreeing with Limbaugh that liberals are ""kooks."" So Emanuel and Limbaugh used the word ""retard"" to describe folks they disagree with, but only Rahm was wrong? Yep, that's how it is in Palin's world. The advocate for the mentally challenged was quick to pounce on someone she disagrees with politically but defended her patron saint, Rush. Sarah, when you hold yourself up as a fierce protector of the mentally challenged, politics shouldn't enter into the equation. Either you criticize everyone who uses a word that you consider a slur, or you come across as a crass politician who is afraid to offend your chief booster. Maybe you ought to listen to your spokeswoman, Meghan Stapleton, who thought you cared about the mentally challenged when she sent this e-mail to HotAir.com about Limbaugh's comment: ""Gov. Palin believes crude and demeaning name-calling at the expense of others is disrespectful."" But knowing that wouldn't sit well with Rush, you backed off and gave him cover. If you were true to your cause, you would have demanded an on-air apology from Limbaugh and scolded him for using the word. Instead, you showed your true colors. Sarah, I haven't bought into your fake ""I'm-a-real-American"" persona. You slam the president for using teleprompters, but write crib notes on your hand to remember basic beliefs that should be easy to regurgitate. You decry the ""lamestream"" media, but you bask in its glory and have joined its payroll as a Fox News contributor, even having the network build a studio in your home. Talk about media elite. You give a speech riddled with falsehoods about the president and national security, and then try to shrug them off as the ""lamestream"" media attacking you. You don't fool me, even as your legion of fans considers you the second coming of President Reagan. You quit on the people who elected you to become a political celebrity, which your presidential running mate blasted then-Sen. Barack Obama for doing. You had the opportunity to show everyone that you're willing to take on anyone who crosses the line against those who are mentally challenged, and you failed. Please, make as much money as you can. Paraphrasing comedian Martin Lawrence, ride this train until the wheels fall off. But please, cut the crap. You're a crass politician with no true conviction. Your actions have shown that. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin.","Roland Martin: Sarah Palin's falsity shown by her different reactions to use of ""retard""

"(CNN) -- The possibility of engine fires has prompted General Motors to recall nearly 1.5 million passenger sedans manufactured between 1997 and 2003, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced Monday. The recall involves certain GM vehicles in which oil apparently can leak and ignite. The recall covers certain mid- and full-size passenger sedans under GM's Chevrolet, Buick, Oldsmobile and Pontiac brands. The affected vehicles have naturally aspirated 3.8 liter V6 engines -- that is, engines that use atmospheric pressure rather than a mechanical blower to bring in air for combustion -- according to documents that GM filed with federal regulators last week. On Friday, the federal government acknowledged the filing and agreed to the plan. The problem involves a potential for oil to leak on the exhaust manifold during hard braking. When a car operates under normal conditions, the manifold can get very hot. Oil that runs below the manifold's heat shield could ignite and spread to plastic channels that hold spark plug wires. As a solution, the company recommends a change in the bracket that holds spark plug wires, which will be done free of charge. Owners and dealers affected by the recall will be notified by letter next month with details. The vehicles involved are: • 1997-2003 Buick Regals. • 1998-2003 Chevrolet Luminas, Monte Carlos and Impalas. • 1998-1999 Oldsmobile Intrigues. • 1997-2003 Pontiac Grand Prix. GM issued a recall on a similar engine in 2008, according to the company's filing with the government. That problem was traced to a faulty gasket on the engine rocker cover.","Recall involves certain Chevrolet, Buick, Oldsmobile and Pontiac sedans .

"Seattle, Washington (CNN) -- The plastic Ziploc bag thrown in the trash in Seattle, Washington, spent a week traveling 300 miles to an Oregon landfill. The old Apple iBook that was recycled is a month into its journey. And a pair of worn Asics running shoes is still logging miles even after being dropped in a bin for used shoes. Those are just some of the trails of trash exposed in a high-tech trash study. ""Normally, you think about the trash for minutes while you take it out to the can,"" says Ethan O'Connor, ""and this trash we are going to be watching on our Web browsers for weeks."" O'Connor and Shannon Cheng are volunteers in a study tracking their trash -- and giving them the opportunity to reflect on what they use and discard. The tracking devices are about the size of small cell phones and allow for near-real-time tracking of thousands of pieces of garbage. The tracking is not part of some top-secret government program to spy on garbage, but rather the brainchild of MIT researchers who wanted to learn if society could more efficiently dispose of what it throws out. ""The idea with this tagging exercise is to bring an invisible system to life,"" said Assaf Biderman, associate director of MIT's SENSEable City Lab. ""By knowing how long it stays in the system, where it goes, we are hoping to create an increased awareness in the public."" Before that increased awareness could be created, however, the scientists needed to devise a way to track pieces of trash, some for hundreds of miles and for up to six months. Researchers are doing most of the tracking via volunteers in Seattle. They plan to expand the program to other cities and compare the attitudes that people in different regions have about garbage. Working with the telecommunications company Qualcomm, the MIT researchers created a device -- or, as the researchers call them, ""traces"" -- that could track a piece of trash using both GPS and cell phone towers. The researchers then asked volunteers to supply items they were already planning to get rid of and put the tracking ""traces"" on the items. The volunteers then threw the material out as they usually would. Just getting the trace on the piece of trash presented its own challenges. Some needed to be taped or sewn into the garbage; others were stuck to the trash with a sticky aerosol spray. The researchers stipulated that the trace not alter how the garbage traveled through the waste system or call attention to the item. ""The thing about trash is that each object is very different,"" Biderman said. ""Different sizes, different textures, different constraints."" O'Connor and Cheng live on a houseboat, where space is at a premium. Participating in the study has allowed the couple to think of larger-picture issues about the trash they produce. But it's not just the trash's owners who are tracking the tems. Waste Management Inc., a waste removal and recycling company, is helping fund the study in the hope that it will show that the trash they dispose of goes where it should. Officials say they are also looking for ways to better deal with garbage. ""It could make a huge difference,"" Waste Management spokeswoman Rita Smith said. ""We want to do everything we can to get our materials to their destinations as efficiently as possible; not only because of the economic cost, but also because of the environmental cost. There's no point in hauling material around in circles."" Researchers are still compiling data as the trash makes its journey. Even though the study has not been completed, the MIT group sees its efforts as a step toward better informing Americans about trash. ""Can we create a situation of minimum waste?"" Biderman said. ""In a certain way, it's about telling people about what they throw away, making people more aware about waste, and perhaps changing their behavior."" Participating in the study has already altered O'Connor's outlook. ""The disposal is one part of it, the using is another,"" he said. ""No one's saying we are bad people for using stuff, but the reality is each one of us gets one-six-billionth of what the Earth can produce, and what we have is much more than that.""","Trash study tracks how pieces of garbage may travel hundreds of miles .

"(CNN) -- Serving a 26-year prison sentence for the murder of her roommate, American Amanda Knox said Sunday she is scared, but determined to prove she is innocent, according to an Italian lawmaker who visited her cell. Knox, 22, seemed very pleased by the visit, which included members of the Italy USA Foundation, said Catia Polidori, a member of the foundation and a member of the Italian Parliament. Knox is also grateful for the foundation's interest in her case, Polidori said. ""In my opinion, in spite of the imprisonment, she seemed to be serene,"" Polidori told CNN. While Knox is aware of the seriousness of her situation, Polidori said, she is ""resolute"" about proving her innocence. Knox was convicted earlier this month of murdering British exchange student Meredith Kercher while the two roomed together in Perugia, Italy, in November 2007. During her trial, Knox read a statement to jurors, insisting she is not a killer. She is appealing her conviction, although her case might not reach a court docket for at least a year. Knox told the visitors she trusts in the Italian justice system to resolve her case, Polidori said. However, she said she was scared, and that ""she is often afraid to open [the] newspaper or watch TV,"" because media reports tend to undermine her confidence, Polidori said. The Italy USA Foundation ""was established to honor the friendship between Italians and Americans,"" according to its Web site. ""The Foundation is an independent institution that intends to play a bipartisan role on both sides of the Atlantic and whose sole purpose is to promote friendship between Italy and the United States of America."" The foundation's president, Rocco Girlanda, said in a statement on the Web site the delegation visited Knox in her cell in Perugia to check on her condition because of the intense U.S. interest in her case. The delegation brought Knox some English-language books as a Christmas gift, which made her ""really happy,"" Polidori told CNN. Prosecutors said Kercher died during a sex game in which Knox taunted Kercher while Knox's then-boyfriend, Raffale Sollecito, and another man, Rudy Guede, sexually assaulted her. Among the evidence against Knox was a knife found in Sollecito's house with Knox's DNA on the handle and Kercher's on the blade. Knox's attorneys attempted to cast doubt on those findings, saying the knife did not match Kercher's wounds or a knife imprint left on a bedsheet. They also claimed the DNA sample was too small to be conclusive. Sollecito was also convicted in Kercher's death and sentenced to 25 years. Guede was convicted earlier in a separate fast-track trial and is appealing his conviction. The verdict against Knox drew criticism from some who questioned the process. Kercher's family, however, has said they were satisfied with the jurors' decision. Knox said she misses her family, Polidori said. Her mother, Edda Mellas, told CNN's Larry King earlier this month that her daughter was ""completely crushed, devastated"" by the verdict against her, but she is ready to fight her conviction. Kurt Knox, Amanda Knox's father, told CNN she had been a victim of ""character assassination."" But he said the Italian appeals process is more flexible than in the American courts, noting the appeals court could open the case for a further evaluation of evidence and new information. ""There are many Italians who have told us that, you know, worst-case scenario, the first level rarely works correctly,"" Mellas told CNN, referring to the jury trial. ""'They'll get it right in appeals, she will get out of there.' They will not, you know, put away this innocent young girl for a crime she didn't commit.""","Delegation from Italy USA Foundation visited Amanda Knox in Italian prison .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- The Miami area seems to be enjoyed most by people who live somewhere else. Garcia's offers freshly caught fish and a great view from a deck overlooking the Miami River. More often than not snowbirds, the yearly visitors who winter in South Florida, and other tourists appear to take over. But there are plenty of places that are beloved by locals and won't cost you a fortune. A good first stop is Lincoln Road, the pedestrian boulevard that runs almost the width of Miami Beach. A farmers' market each Sunday is a weekly meeting point for many locals, and although the area has lost some of its identity to chains, there are plenty of unique restaurants and shops to sample. Start your stroll on Lincoln with coffee at David's Café (1654 Meridian Ave.). From a large open window facing the street, the cafe keeps the Cuban coffee flowing 24/7 to a wide mix of Miamians who line up for their caffeine fix. Not too much English is spoken here though, so practice the following: cafecito (a shot of sugary Cuban coffee), cortadito (sugary Cuban coffee cut with milk) and café con leche (a Latin latte). A block west of David's is The Frieze (1626 Michigan Ave.), which devoted regulars will swear serves the best ice cream in the world. A taste of one of the many flavors of ice cream or sorbet -- made from fresh local fruits -- may make you a convert as well. Flavors such as wasabi or tamarind have to be tried to be believed. Whether it's the best in the world is open for debate, but for sure The Frieze serves the best scoops in Miami. At Segafredo's, on the West end of Lincoln (1040 Lincoln Road), the real attraction is people watching. It's the place to see and be seen in Miami Beach. Customers spending hundreds of dollars on champagne and cocktails or a few bucks on coffee and simple snacks enjoy the same great view of local characters on parade and the beautiful people who act as if Lincoln Road were their own personal catwalk. North of Lincoln Road, on the Biscayne Bay side of Miami Beach is Joe Allen restaurant (1787 Purdy Ave.), a bastion of good food and service that a crowd of mostly local clientele has kept going for nearly a decade. The restaurant has locations in other cities, but walking into the low-key Miami Beach dining room you would swear you stumbled onto a well-kept secret. Joe Allen's serves really fresh comfort food: steaming plates of mussels in an Asian broth, homemade pastas, great burgers and a killer meatloaf. This is not the place for celebrity sightings and the latest trendy food, but you will eat well and not break the bank. Many Miami restaurants boast they serve the freshest fish in town, but few have their own fishing fleet to back up the claim. Garcia's Seafood Grille and Fish Market (398 N.W. N. River Drive, Miami) offers its own freshly caught fish and a great view from a deck overlooking the Miami River. It's a trick to get there, and the restaurant is one of the few bright spots in a still run-down area of downtown Miami, so go with good directions. As you lunch on a mahi-mahi sandwich with a beer served in an ice-cold mug and watch the boats go by, the trip to Garcia's will seem well worth the effort. It wouldn't be Miami, of course, without the beach, and every local has his or her own preferred strip of sand. The beach at Collins Avenue and 87th Terrace is a favorite for people who want to relax with the Sunday paper and a fold-out chair. The water and sand seem cleaner than most other beaches and the area is a favorite for kite surfers. If you aren't already a local, you soon will feel like one after a few hours there with the sand between your toes.","Miamians line up for Cuban coffee at David's Cafe .

"Washington (CNN)  -- The House voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to repeal the antitrust exemption currently granted to health insurance companies. The vote was 406-19 to repeal the exemption, which has been in place since the end of World War II. The 19 who voted against the repeal are Republicans. Liberal Democrats have said a repeal would help inject competition into the health care industry while reducing consumer costs. White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs told reporters Tuesday that President Obama strongly supports the repeal. ""At its core, health reform is all about ensuring that American families and businesses have more choices, benefit from more competition and have greater control over their own health care,"" Gibbs said. Read the bill . ""Repealing this exemption is an important part of that effort. Gibbs said the president is not seeking repeal of the exemption in lieu of broader changes to the insurance market. ""This is a complementary step along the way,"" he said. The debate in the House on Wednesday included a colorful moment between Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-New York, and Republicans. ""You guys have chutzpah,"" Weiner told Republicans during the debate. ""The Republican Party is a wholly owned subsidiary of the insurance industry,"" he said, drawing the objections of Republicans, who asked that his words be stricken from the record. Weiner then asked for unanimous consent to replace his words and said, ""Every single Republican I have ever met in my entire life is a wholly owned subsidiary of the insurance industry."" The Republicans objected again, prompting Weiner to rescind his words. The House version of the health care bill passed last year would have removed the antitrust exemption, while the Senate's version would not. Advocates of an exemption repeal say the exemption has allowed health insurance companies to essentially divide the country into geographic zones. They argue the companies benefit from what amounts to local monopolies. Industry defenders, in turn, point out that insurers are still subject to state regulations. They say the impact of an exemption repeal is overblown. CNN Fact Check: Would exemption repeal lower premiums? Administration officials and their allies in Congress have taken an increasingly tough stance against the unpopular insurance industry. Among other things, Obama's latest proposal for health care reform would give the federal government new authority to block excessive rate increases by health insurers. Specifically, Obama's plan calls for the secretary of health and human services to work with a seven-member board made up of doctors, economists and consumer and insurance representatives to review premium increases. The board, to be known as the Health Insurance Rate Authority, would provide an annual report to recommend to states whether certain rate increases should be approved, although the secretary could overrule state insurance regulators.","House votes 406-19 to repeal exemption in place since end of World War II .

"TOKYO, Japan -- Three-time grand prix winner Norifumi Abe of Japan has been killed in a street crash when his 500cc scooter collided with a truck making an illegal U-turn, police have revealed on Monday. Abe won two grand prix in Japan and another in Brazil during the 1990s. The 32-year-old ploughed into the truck while it was turning in the Tokyo suburb of Kawasaki. In 1994, while racing in his home championship, Abe had a chance to race at the 1994 Japanese Grand Prix as a 'wild card'. He was challenging strongly for a remarkable victory until three corners from the finish when he fell off. His impressed Kenny Roberts' Yamaha team sufficiently to be offered two more rides in the 500cc championship that year. Abe finished sixth in both and was given a full-time 500cc ride for the 1995 season. He took his first podium finish in 1995, and his first win and fifth overall a year later. He moved to the D'Antin team in 1999, won at Rio that year, and won again at Suzuka a year later, amidst two seasons on less competitive machinery, in which his solid finishing ensured that his 100 per cent record of top 10 championship finishes continued. Abe was less happy under MotoGP regulations but when he was moved to Yamaha's returning World Superbike squad for 2005, despite having less support than Noriyuki Haga and Andrew Pitt, he finished in the championship top 10. In 2006 he did not make a podium and this year he competed in the All-Japan Superbike Championship, again on a Yamaha.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- NATO troops in Afghanistan launched their biggest offensive of the war early Saturday, attacking what they call the last Taliban stronghold in a war-scarred southern province. Military officials said the offensive -- dubbed Operation Moshtarak -- got under way at 2 a.m. (4:30 p.m. ET Friday). Moshtarak, a Dari word for ""together,"" symbolizes the fact that combined forces are serving alongside one another. ""Insurgents who do not accept the government's offer to reintegrate and join the political process will be met with overwhelming force,"" the International Security Assistance Force Joint Command said in a statement. ""However, the strongest of measures will be taken to protect the civilian population."" Some of about 15,000 troops from the United States, United Kingdom, Afghanistan and Canada attacked Taliban targets in and around Marjah, a city of 80,000 to 100,000 residents, where the Taliban has set up a shadow government, coalition military authorities said. By about 8 a.m. (10 p.m. ET Friday) two firefights had erupted between the Taliban and U.S. Marines in Marjah. ""Marjah is the last enemy sanctuary in the Marine area of operations,"" said Brig. Gen. Larry Nicholson, 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade-Afghanistan commanding general. ""This operation is designed to reconnect the people of Marjah with the legitimate government of Afghanistan. We are fully partnered with the Afghan government for this operation, and we have the resources we need to be successful."" The Afghan government described the offensive -- carried out in central Helmand with the Afghan National Army, Afghan National Police, ISAF Regional Command (South), and the Helmand Provincial Reconstruction Team -- as ""clearing"" operations. The coalition said its troops expected to confront up to 1,000 entrenched Taliban fighters. It said they also expected foreign Taliban fighters to battle to the death but were prepared for local Taliban members in Marjah to try to escape. ""We will follow the enemies and bring them to justice,"" said Gen. Mohiyiden Ghori of the Afghan National Army. In the past few days, forces from Afghanistan, Britain and other nations conducted air and ground operations to prepare for the assault and dropped leaflets in and around Marjah warning residents not to allow the Taliban to enter their homes. The allies had been unusually vocal in describing their plans for the assault. ""I think there's a certain strength in the Pashtunwali culture just from laying it out there in saying, 'Hey, we are coming. Deal with it,'"" U.S. Marine Gen. Larry Nicholson said. Some of the 30,000 additional U.S. troops that President Obama sent to Afghanistan were taking part in the fight. More on Operation Moshtarak from Afghanistan Crossroads blog . The goal is to force the Taliban from Marjah to free the opium-rich province of Taliban influence and drug traffickers. It's an example of a U.S. strategy to focus on population centers and separate the Taliban from Afghan civilians. ""It's about the security of the population, not fighting down insurgent numbers,"" British Gen. Gordon Messenger has said. About 3,000 U.S. Marines were involved in the fight. The advance notice given to residents was expected to help avert civilian casualties, a problem that has hurt the military's credibility among Afghans. They were also trying to get those Taliban who aren't hard-core to turn in themselves and their weapons. Reaching the battleground was expected to be a big challenge for NATO and Afghan troops. The tough terrain is hard for tanks to traverse. The town of Marjah is surrounded by roadside bombs, military officials said. They said the Taliban has had months to plant the bombs, most of them homemade mixes of ammonium nitrate, shrapnel fuel, salt or flour. Such bombs -- which are detonated remotely or by pressure plates -- have caused about 80 percent of the deaths in fighting in Helmand province, military officials said. ""This is possibly the largest IED threat NATO has ever faced,"" Nicholson has said. Massive armored vehicles, called assault breacher vehicles, were to lead the charge into Marjah, coalition authorities said before the offensive. The tank-like vehicles can destroy roadside bombs. Even with their help, though, military officials have increased staff at the hospital at Camp Bastion, in the capital of Helmand province, in anticipation that roadside bombs would cause casualties. Troops were expecting to encounter booby-trapped houses and fierce urban combat.","15,000 multinational troops take part in effort to attack Taliban in Marjah .

"LOS ANGELES, California -- Dr. Andre Berger sees himself as a pioneer. Where others in the medical community believe injections of human growth hormone should be given to adults in only rare cases, Berger believes it is a crucial part of keeping people young and vital. Dr. Andre Berger says the patients requesting HGH from him are getting younger and younger. Berger, who has been practicing anti-aging and holistic medicine for 30 years, says he is now prescribing injections of HGH to about one out of every four people he treats at his Rejuvalife Vitality Institute in Beverly Hills. ""People come here for generally two reasons; they want to look better, and they want to feel better,"" Berger says. While Berger says most of his patients are middle-aged, he's now getting calls from Hollywood 30-somethings wanting HGH and rap artists inquiring about illegal steroids, something he does not offer. ""They feel that part of being a rap star is looking buff and having big muscles, etc., so anything they can do to bring themselves to look like that is going to enhance the whole image,"" he says. HGH has been used since the 1950s to help children with growth problems, but it stayed under the radar for other uses until 1990, when Dr. Daniel Rudman reported in the New England Journal of Medicine that men taking a six-month course of HGH reduced their body fat by 14.4 percent while increasing lean muscle mass by 8.8 percent. The study included just a dozen men, but it inspired a flood of anti-aging literature touting the benefits of growth hormone, along with countless Web sites selling HGH creams and sprays. Endocrinologists say those products, though, are worthless -- the body can use HGH only when it's injected to treat patients with HGH, Berger says they must be diagnosed with a deficiency of HGH, which happens naturally as the body ages. ""It's a very important hormone, but it's not something to be taken in isolation,"" he says. Berger says he prescribes HGH to restore normal levels of the hormone and makes it part of a broader long-term treatment program including diet, nutritional supplements, exercise and other hormone replacement. Dennis Pelino, a 60-year-old Beverly Hills entrepreneur, says five years ago, he was having trouble keeping up with the younger people he was doing business with, so he started treatments, which included HGH injections. ""My skin tone got a lot better. I just felt better,"" he says. ""My eyes got a lot brighter. My hearing, I swear, got better."" Pelino says HGH injections, along with a healthy diet, exercise, and supplements has made him feel 10 years younger. ""I can keep up with people who are a lot younger than me,"" he says. ""I am not trying to set records, I am just trying to stay in the game, I am doing business here."" But critics argue that doctors are taking huge risks by administering HGH because it hasn't been studied extensively long-term and says many of the same benefits can be found in diet and exercise alone. ""There are serious side effects associated with using growth hormone for these individuals including an elevated risk of cancer, diabetes,"" says Dr. Jay Olshansky of the University of Illinois at Chicago. Olshansky, who has studied anti-aging for over 20 years, contends that many of the claims are just false and says that only in the rarest of cases can HGH be prescribed legally. ""It can be prescribed in adults for only two things; muscle-wasting associated with HIV/AIDS, which is extremely rare, and for adult growth hormone deficiency,"" he says. Still, celebrities including Sylvester Stallone and Suzanne Somers who have openly supported the use of HGH, have attracted those just seeking a new lease on life. Marketers for HGH therapies claim it's become a $2 billion-a-year business, thanks in large part to aging baby boomers willing to pay big bucks to emulate the stars whose looks never seem to fade. The Albany-Times Union recently reported, citing unnamed sources, that rapper 50 Cent and singer Mary J. Blige were among celebrity customers allegedly identified in a New York probe of doctors and pharmacists who illegally prescribe steroids or HGH. The Times-Union report did not suggest there was evidence Blige or 50 cent took the drugs. Blige denies taking any performance enhancing drugs, and 50 Cent has not commented. Neither star is accused of breaking the law. E-mail to a friend .","Doctor says more 30-somethings want steroids and HGH .

"LEONE, American Samoa (CNN) -- Taitasi Fitiao was holding her six-year-old daughter's hand when a tsunami wave crashed onto their coastal village in American Samoa. A man stands on the remains of what was once a tourist resort in Samoa's capital of Apia. ""I held her hand. The wave got us and that's when her hand just left mine and I could hear her say, 'Mom, please.' And then I saw her, I saw her floating away. And I knew right then that she was gone, she was taken from us."" Taitasi Fitiao ran to her daughter's school after an 8.0-magnitude earthquake rocked the small cluster of Samoan islands early Tuesday, triggering a tsunami. The teacher had let the students go home after the temblor struck. Fitiao had felt some relief when she briefly united with her daughter, but then the wave came. ""I can't believe she's gone. She's only six years old,"" she said of her youngest child, Valjorefa Uputaua Fitiao. The villagers of Leone --one of the largest towns in American Samoa with a population of more than 2,000 -- searched for Valjorefa. They found her about one day after the waves took her from her mother. ""When they found her, she still had her backpack on and school uniform,"" Fitiao said.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Clashes between Palestinians and Israeli soldiers broke out Monday, a day after Israel announced it would include two West Bank religious shrines as part of a larger list of 150 Zionist heritage sites. About 100 protesters were throwing stones and burning tires in the West Bank city of Hebron, the Israeli military said. Palestinian eyewitnesses reported that several protesters had been injured by tear gas and rubber bullets. The clashes come in the wake of a special Sunday Cabinet meeting held at one of the ""national heritage"" sites where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu outlined a plan to invest more than $100 million on national heritage infrastructure. ""People must be familiar with their homeland and its cultural and historical vistas,"" he said. ""This is what we will instill in this and coming generations, to the glory -- if I may say -- of the Jewish people."" Included in the list of sites are Rachel's Tomb in Palestinian city of Bethlehem and the Tomb of the Patriarchs in the city of Hebron. A top United Nations official said the inclusion of sites in the West Bank raised concerns because they were ""in occupied Palestinian territory."" The Tomb of the Patriarchs -- known to Palestinians as Ibrahimi mosque -- is in Hebron, a West Bank city that houses about 500 Jews heavily guarded by Israeli soldiers, who live among about 170,000 Palestinians. The tomb is revered by Jews and Muslims as holy and has been a point of frequent conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians for years. In 1994, an Israeli settler entered the tomb and opened fire on the Muslim worshippers, killing 29 before he was beaten to death. Rachel's Tomb is known to Palestinians as the mosque of Bilal. The Palestinian reaction after the announcement was fast and furious. A statement by the Revolutionary Council of Fatah, the political faction in charge of the Palestinian Authority, called the Israeli plan a move to ""consolidate the occupation"" and an effort at ""judaizing"" Palestinian land. Dr. Hamdan Taha, an official at the Palestinian Authority's Ministry of Tourism, said the the two sites were ""an integral part of Palestinian culture"" and that if the Israeli government persisted in its efforts, ""Palestinians will feel free to nominate sites inside the green line in their heritage list."" Green line refers to the border before Israel occupied the West Bank. Nationalist and right wing parties in Israel praised the government move and called for the inclusion of more West Bank locations to the list of heritage sites. Robert H. Serry, the United Nations special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, also expressed concern. ""These sites are in occupied Palestinian territory and are of historical and religious significance not only to Judaism but also to Islam, and to Christianity as well,"" he said in a statement. ""I urge Israel not to take any steps on the ground which undermine trust or could prejudice negotiations, the resumption of which should be the highest shared priority of all who seek peace."" Nationalist and right-wing parties in Israel praised the government move and called for the inclusion of more West Bank locations to the list of heritage sites. Mark Regev, a spokesman for Netanyahu, said no one could deny that the two West Bank locations were of historical and religious significance to the Jews. He said the danger of their inclusion on a list of sites to the peace process was overstated.","Sites include Rachel's Tomb in Bethlehem and Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron .

"Decatur, Georgia (CNN) -- Given all their country and people have been through, between political upheavals, human rights abuses, hurricanes, abject poverty and last week's earthquake, ""If Haitians were constantly questioning their faith, they would all be atheists."" These words came from the Rev. Eric Hill as he prepared to lead Haitian Mass Sunday at Saints Peter and Paul Catholic Church in Decatur, Georgia. Some of the 100 Haitian parishioners who gathered raised their hands to the heavens in praise, grateful their loved ones had been found. Others bowed their heads and clenched their hands for those lost, still missing and all who suffered. One woman wept out of guilt because she -- a U.S. citizen -- had been able to leave her devastated homeland a day after the quake, while so many were left behind. Their unshaken faith and devotion to God is the same sort that's played out in other houses of worship, in living rooms and on the torn-up streets of Haiti. Are you in Haiti and safe? Share your story, photos with CNN iReport . Carmella Delerme of Miami, Florida, said her mother clung to her Bible for days, reading psalms over and over again, as they waited for word on the whereabouts and condition of Delerme's sister and other relatives. When her sister, who was in Haiti on a missionary trip with their Seventh-day Adventist Church, called late Thursday, Delerme said, ""I went straight to church and prayed and prayed and prayed. We continue to pray for those who are lost and still in need."" On the streets of Port-au-Prince, with many of their churches crumbled, people have gathered to worship and sing Catholic and Protestant hymns. ""That's the soundscape of the country right now,"" said Elizabeth McAlister, a professor of religion and anthropologist of Haiti who teaches at Wesleyan University in Connecticut. ""It's the business of religion to create meaning out of chaos. ... Tragically, the business of religion is getting a lot of trade today."" See complete coverage of Haiti earthquake . It's often said that 80 percent of Haitians are Catholic, although other estimates range from 55 percent to 85 percent. McAlister, who puts her best estimate at 70 percent, said getting a proper census in Haiti to nail down numbers is impossible. But between Protestant denominations and Catholicism, it is without doubt a majority Christian country, she said. Weaved in, however, are the nuances that come with the country's troubled history. Colonized by the French, the land then known as Saint-Domingue emerged as one of the wealthiest colonies of the 18th century. It's flourishing sugar production and aggressive deforestation was achieved on the backs of half a million African slaves. They brought with them their own belief systems, rooted in West and Central African traditions. Haitian Vodou, often misunderstood and branded with stereotypes, has its own ceremonies and rituals meant to honor spirits, or loas. These spirits, seen as intermediaries with God and links to ancestors, can be called upon for help. And for practicing Christians, especially Catholics who can view saints as they would spirits, the two systems do not have to be mutually exclusive. Not everyone is necessarily practicing Vodou, commonly anglicized as Voodoo, but McAlister said the Afro-Creole Haitian traditions are usually kept alive and the ancestral spirits are inherited by at least one member of every family. Haitian-born Leslie Desmangles remembered being hurt as a boy by the words of Christian missionaries who misunderstood and demonized his peoples' traditions. Theirs were sentiments much like those uttered last week by televangelist Pat Robertson who said the Haitian people are ""cursed"" because they ""swore a pact with the devil"" to get out from under French rule. Robertson's comments were ""insensitive, theologically unsound and loaded with racial connotations,"" said Desmangles, a professor of religion and international studies at Trinity College in Connecticut. In the Decatur church Sunday, the priest reminded his congregants that theirs is an all-loving God, not a vindictive one. Their God, he said, is in the international outpouring of support from people who, one week ago, didn't know where Haiti was. Their God is a rock of stability when the earth trembles. Their God is the one who lifts them up ""to mend our broken bones, to brush us off and to bury the dead,"" Hill said. And during this first Sunday Mass after the earthquake, their God was in the music that moved them. To the distinctly Caribbean sounds of their band and choir, they sang hymns of praise to the one they believe stands with them. ""People continue to be God's instruments,"" the pastor said, with the help of a Creole translator. ""God will work through all of us to bring new life to Haiti."" As he spoke, a little girl, too young to understand the pain around her, did what she could. She planted kisses on the forehead of her anguished father, his face buried in his hands, before skipping off to make fish faces and giggle with other children.","Haitians would be atheists if they questioned faith, given all they've seen, priest says .
Instead belief in God remains unshaken, as seen in churches, homes and on streets .

"PARKLAND, Florida (CNN) -- Yorelle Haroush fled a million-dollar South Florida home this week, chased out, she said, by drywall made in China that's emitting vapors that smell like rotten eggs. Amy Massachi hugs her pregnant niece, Yorelle Haroush, as she prepares to move this week. ""It's making me sick. Physically, mentally and emotionally, making me sick,"" said the 18-year-old, who is pregnant with her first child. Haroush lives with her aunt Amy Massachi and her four siblings and cousins in the house. They believe a year's worth of upper respiratory infections, antibiotics, bloody noses and sickness have been caused by the walls. Their doctor said they need to get out of the $1.2 million estate in Parkland, Florida, northwest of Fort Lauderdale. ""I said, 'you can't stay there anymore, because you're sick every minute,'"" the family's longtime physician, Dr. Ross Nochimson, told CNN. ""They're sick on a weekly basis. Earaches, sore throat. I give them something, and they're sick again."" Massachi and her family are among homeowners in more than a dozen states who allege Chinese drywall has emitted corrosive gases they believe have given them health problems. Homeowners also allege the gases corrode metal components including copper wiring, causing air conditioners and other household systems to fail.  Read about homeowners' allegations » . The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission says most of the complaints have come from Florida, where the concerns emerged last year. But consumers also have filed complaints in Louisiana, Virginia, Wisconsin, Ohio, Alabama, Mississippi, California, Washington, Wyoming, Arizona, Tennessee and Washington, D.C. The Florida Department of Health says complaints it received -- more than 330 as of Tuesday -- generally involve homes built between 2004 and 2007. A study done for the Florida health department by private laboratory Unified Engineering Inc. found that samples of certain Chinese drywall gave off a sulfurous odor from ""volatile sulfur compounds"" when exposed to extreme heat and moisture. It also found that vapors ""in the residential atmosphere created a corrosive environment in the presence of moisture."" The health effects of those vapors are still the subject of several scientific studies. Odors and corrosion are clearly evident in the Massachi house. The pungent, rotten-egg-like smell permeates the two-story home. Throughout the house, electrical outlets are open to reveal black corrosion on the copper wiring. The air conditioning unit's air handler, inside the house, is blackened. ""This is disgusting. It's so corroded. I can't even believe it,"" Amy Massachi said in a raspy voice. ""I can't breathe. Every morning, I wake up with sinus allergies, my voice is hoarse.  Watch Massachi explain what's happening in her house » . ""My mother, when I call her up on the phone, she says, 'Amy, what's wrong with your voice?' and I say, 'allergies.'  ""'What are you allergic to?' I don't know. Well, now I know. I'm allergic to my house. My house is making us sick."" The doctor recommends they vacate their 18-month-old home. ""Before they bought this house, they weren't calling every week with allergies and sore throats and ear aches and coughing,"" Nochimson said. ""I don't know what more I can do for them."" Haroush, who after giving birth faces heart surgery for an unrelated condition, is moving in with her grandmother. ""I'm graduating this year, and I'm having a baby, and I don't need to be thinking about anything else going wrong, and any more stress that is on me,"" she told CNN. Chinese drywall was imported into the U.S. during a different economic era, at the height of a housing boom. Prices were sky high, and the country was hit by two active hurricane seasons in 2004 and 2005, increasing the demand for home repairs. Suppliers were forced to look elsewhere for their drywall supply. Drywall, made from gypsum, is regularly imported from Mexico and Canada, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, but during this time frame, the U.S. looked to China to make up for the shortage. The Gypsum Association told CNN that enough drywall was imported from China to build 30,000 complete homes. Most of the Chinese drywall, they say, ended up in southwest Florida during the housing boom, where it was used in new housing developments. Some was also used in remodeling projects all over the country, so the number of homes affected is difficult to calculate. The Consumer Product Safety Commission hopes to have more answers in the coming months. They continue to test the Chinese drywall, including controlled tests in chambers and real-world air sampling tests in homes, to determine how the drywall interacts with other elements in an average house. ""We don't deny there's a problem,"" spokesman Joe Martyak said. But there has been no positive link to adverse health effects. ""We don't know what it is that's causing the sore throats or bleeding noses. We have to find out what's causing the problem,"" he said. The Environmental Protection Agency and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are doing studies on the health effects, but those examinations are some time away from completion. The Consumer Product Safety Commission is having ongoing conversations with Chinese officials, who will be sending a representative to the United States to study the problem. ""They appreciate the seriousness of the issue here and trying to be cooperative,"" Martyak said. A handful of Chinese companies have been sued by homeowners and home builders. In the meantime, homeowners like Massachi face financial hardship. ""Now, because they have to move out for health reasons, they're taking on a whole second (rent) payment,"" said Massachi's attorney, Michael Ryan. Ryan said he's had no luck trying to convince Massachi's home lenders to suspend mortgage payments until the house can be made livable again. He told CNN his clients are ""having to make choices about their credit, and whether they are going to lose their home. But they're always going to pick their health first."" Massachi agrees. A good look at her blackened air conditioning coil was all she needed. She's looking to rent a new place. ""That's what I'm breathing in....I'm a little freaked out now, honestly,"" she said, her raspy voice cracking with tears. ""It can't be good, if that's what that looks like and it's pumping throughout my entire house,"" she said. Eighteen months ago, Massachi says, she moved into her dream house, surrounded by family and friends. Now the dream is a nightmare. ""It's worth nothing,"" she said of the home. ""It's exclusive. It's pricey, and now it's worth nothing.""","Florida family is ""sick on a weekly basis,"" physician says .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The former judge who last year lost a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against a dry cleaners over a missing pair of pants wants his job back. Roy Pearson sued the owners of this dry cleaning business for $54 million over a missing pair of pants. Roy Pearson was not reappointed after his term expired as an administrative law judge in the District of Columbia. He filed a lawsuit Thursday in federal court accusing city government and others of an ""unlawful demotion and subsequent termination."" Pearson was taken off the bench in May 2007, during his unsuccessful $54 million lawsuit against a dry cleaning business, which he accused of failing to meet its promise of ""satisfaction guaranteed."" As an administrative law judge, Pearson would hear cases involving zoning law and certain business disputes. A city panel that decides reappointments had notified Pearson during the controversial lost trousers trial that his status was under review. A source on that panel said at the time that any judge must meet certain standards of conduct ""on and off the bench."" The source, who was among the members of the panel at the time of Pearson's review, said ""a judge is a judge 24/7; whether or not they use good judgment in all aspects of their lives is what we can consider."" The civil case, in which Pearson represented himself, sought punitive and compensatory damages against a small family-owned dry cleaners that once posted signs promising ""satisfaction guaranteed."" A pair of trousers that hung by the witness stand was a featured part of the trial last summer. The owners testified that the pants belonged to Pearson, who denied under oath that they were his. The judge found in favor of the dry cleaners and disagreed with Pearson that the satisfaction promise was unconditional. Pearson petitioned the trial judge for a reconsideration, which was denied. He then filed an appeal with the D.C. Court of Appeals, which will hear his appeal later this year. In court documents made available Friday at U.S. District Court in Washington, Pearson, again acting as his own attorney, relies on what he considers Washington's ""Whistleblower Protection"" law to try to establish illegal retaliation. The trial over the lost trousers generated a storm of criticism among fairness advocates, who accused Pearson of abusing the system. The latest litigation has begun to produce the same reaction. ""He lost his job because he proved he did not have the legal requirements to fill the job, namely a judicial temperament,"" said Darren McKinney of the American Tort Reform Association. Pearson did not return a message left at home. In his suit seeking to regain his job, he also seeks ""compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, in excess of $75,000 from all defendants jointly and severally,"" as well as an unspecified amount of punitive damages ""to be determined at trial."" Efforts to seek reaction from the individuals named in the lawsuit were unsuccessful. No initial hearing date has been set in the civil case assigned to U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Heidi Newfield goes into Sunday's Academy of Country Music Awards with five nominations. It's more than any other female, but she still considers herself the dark horse -- and in many ways, she is, especially since she's up for top female vocalist against such heavyweights as Carrie Underwood and Taylor Swift. Heidi Newfield says she considers herself an underdog at Sunday's Academy of Country Music Awards. For 10 years, Newfield was the lead singer of the honky-tonk trio Trick Pony. Her soulful debut solo album, ""What Am I Waiting for,"" was released in August to stellar reviews -- many from critics who scoffed at the high-energy antics of her former band. If you spend any time with the petite blonde from Northern California, you're struck by how many times she says, ""Please"" and ""Thank you."" There's a smile for everyone -- waiters, doormen, cameramen -- and she steers conversation away from herself to ask how others are doing. Newfield is a nice girl. But her life changed when a fellow musician told her to stop being so nice, as she revealed in the following interview with CNN:  Watch Newfield talk about her nominations » . CNN: What went through your head when you received five nominations for this year's Academy of Country Music Awards? Heidi Newfield: I thought one or two would be so fabulous, that would be so great. And they kept calling my name, and you know, I won't lie -- I'm going to tell on my husband -- the tears started flowing, and we were just really happy. All the hard work, all the time, and all the road -- and just the experience over time starts to play back in your mind, just like a movie.This is a really special time. CNN: Was it validation that leaving Trick Pony was the right thing to do? Newfield: People tell you, ""You can't do this."" You know in country music oftentimes it does not work when a front person leaves a group. In other genres -- pop, rock, hip-hop and rap -- people can leave all the time and do amazing things on their own. Beyonce, Justin Timberlake, Sting -- there's a gazillion people. But in country, we have that tight-knit, almost family relationship with our fans, so when you change something up, they don't always like that very much. CNN: Did you feel guilty about leaving Trick Pony? Newfield: No, not an ounce of guilt. I left Trick Pony with my head held high. I felt like I left with total dignity and class, and I didn't leave anybody hanging. I fulfilled every obligation, no matter how hard it was -- and it was hard. There was a lot of drama, and they weren't exactly happy with me. I don't mind saying this, but it was miserable the last several months. But my intuition was saying it's time to make a change. So did I stay too long? I don't know. I mean, everything happens for a reason. Had I left three years ago, maybe I wouldn't have been the same person I am today. CNN: John Popper from Blues Traveler kind of gave you a kick in the pants. Newfield: Oh, I love Poppy! We talk all the time, I kid you not. John was on a USO tour with us for 2½ weeks, so we got to know each other really well. Every night, he would come on stage and do a [harmonica] number with me. On the last night of the tour, we were in Germany, and we were at this pub, and Poppy said to me, ""You love this, and it's clear you're a musician -- but you need to learn to stop being so nice. You need to speak your mind and step up and step up for yourself."" His actual words were, ""When you learn to be a b----,"" that's what he told me. And I thought, ""Well, my philosophy is I don't think you ever, ever, ever have to be a diva or a prima donna to make it to a certain level."" I think you can always treat people with respect and be nice, and I always plan on doing that. But what he said was right. When you start to believe in yourself, that's when there's no limit to what you can do. CNN: Your debut solo album, ""What Am I Waiting for,"" shows a lot of growth. It's much more introspective and mature, whereas Trick Pony's music was brash and not as multidimensional. Newfield: When my producer Tony Brown and I first sat down to talk about making this album, one of the first things that came out of his mouth was, ""We have to show people who you really are. We need to cut songs, and you need to explore parts of your vocals that you never got a change to showcase."" All the ACM nominations are validation that we are on the path to doing just that and being taken seriously as an artist -- as a singer, as a songwriter and as a musician. We made a record that made people say, ""Hey, this girl can sing."" And that's what I had always hoped. CNN: Still, it's a building process, and in a lot of ways, you're starting from scratch. Newfield: At this one fair that I went to, they had my name spelled H-e-d-y instead of H-e-i-d-i. Hedy Newfield. And I thought, ""Oh, that's just great."" And, of course, you go up to the promoter and say, ""Come on, hook a sister up here."" So we're fixing that. CNN: Of the five awards you're up for at the ACMs, you have to be most thrilled about top female vocalist. [Newfield is up against Underwood, Swift, Lee Ann Womack and Miranda Lambert.) Newfield: I'm the biggest dark horse ever. I'm the big underdog, but I like to be the underdog. I hope the makeup's rockin'. I hope I look good at that moment when they call out, ""Carrie Underwood.""","Heidi Newfield is up for five Academy of Country Music Awards .

"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN)  -- On a visit to the border city of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, President Felipe Calderon apologized to the families of 15 people killed in a massacre last month and promised residents that their input would form part of the strategy against drug-related violence. After meeting with the families, Calderon and local political and civic leaders presented a variety of ideas, critiques and proposals on how to stabilize a city that saw more than 2,500 killings last year and more than 230 so far this year. Juarez is one of the front lines in Calderon's offensive against the country's major drug trafficking organizations. The violence in Juarez is a result of a bloody turf war between the Juarez drug cartel and the Sinaloa cartel over lucrative smuggling routes into the United States. Many of the killings are between rival gangs, something that Calderon's government hinted at in the aftermath of the January 31 massacre of a group of young partygoers that shocked the city. In this case, it turned out that mistaken identity was behind the incident and that the youths killed were innocent. On Thursday, Calderon apologized and gave his condolences to the victims' families for suggesting that their children were somehow involved. The president also responded to criticism that the security strategy in Juarez was being imposed by politicians from afar with little understanding of their city. ""I come mostly to listen,"" Calderon said, adding ""we're looking for solutions from Juarez because you are the ones living it."" Representatives of different sectors of the city's civil society -- security, human rights, religious -- took turns giving their proposals in front of Calderon and a tense crowd. Many speakers were interrupted by heckling or criticisms from the crowd. When Juarez Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz addressed the measures his government has taken to secure the city, some in the crowd booed and responded that he resides on the other side of the border, in El Paso, Texas. Before the meeting, police forcibly removed some protesters that were lined up outside of the building where Calderon would speak. Several of the audience members interrupted the meetings by yelling protests against the way the young demonstrators were treated. Arturo Valenzuela, a doctor who represented the security sector, said that security operations in Juarez to date have failed. Calderon has dispatched thousands of soldiers and federal police officers to supplement local police forces. He recommended the appointment of one leader who would coordinate among local, state and federal agencies involved in securing the city. ""The way the operation is currently structured, it will never work,"" Valenzuela said. He also highlighted other security problems outside of the killings. Kidnappings increased 3,000 percent in 2009, he said, and most business owners are extorted by organized crime. A speaker representing the human rights sector, Lorenza Patricia Galarza, said the military was responsible for 1,000 human rights violations and should be removed from Juarez. Calderon said he will not tolerate military abuses and challenged Galarza to present evidence of the abuses she cited. The military, at least for now, is not going anywhere, Calderon made clear. Violence in Juarez comes amid a backdrop of vastly increased numbers of homicides nationwide, as drug cartels battle each other and the Mexican government steps up its efforts to combat them. The government has not released official figures, but national media say 7,600 Mexicans lost their lives in the war on drugs in 2009. Calderon said last year that 6,500 Mexicans died in drug violence in 2008. Officials say more than 16,000 Mexicans have died since Calderon declared war on the drug cartels shortly after taking office in December 2006.","Felipe Calderon meets with residents of Ciudad Juarez .

"(CNN) -- A week into the Haitian disaster, the desperate and dusty faces of both survivors and rescuers tell a plaintive story: We need more, more, more. And fast. The capital's airport, the country's roads and its ports were devastated by last week's 7.0-magnitude earthquake, leaving Haiti's crumpled infrastructure the chief obstacle to fresh supplies as well as food and water. ""The significant limiting factor in terms of our ability to move forward is a reality of the infrastructure in Haiti,"" U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley told reporters Tuesday. ""But to the credit of the United States military, we started the operation (at Port-au-Prince's airport) with maybe 20 or so flights a day. They're now up well over 100."" The goal, he said, is to double that number. Opening a second runway would help, he said. So, too, would lighting at the airport. Search list of missing and found . ""Last night, we couldn't see to land the plane that was supposed to land,"" said Renzo Fricke, the chief of Haiti operations for the aid organization Doctors Without Borders. ""The night before we were supposed to receive two planes that couldn't land. The night before it was the same. That's our fourth plane that's not able to land."" Fricke told CNN's Christiane Amanpour Tuesday that although the organization was ""facing huge problems"" in receiving supplies, the work went on. ""This morning we had to buy a saw in the market, in the city ... for our surgeons to do amputations,"" he said. ""We had to buy a saw because our materials -- the medical equipment is not coming as it should arrive."" Fricke said that some equipment and other materials are coming into Haiti by road from the Dominican Republic, a route that Crowley cited as one of several that are slowly being opened to channel aid. The airport, the ports, U.S. Navy ships with helicopters and a U.S. Marine unit are all important to getting vital supplies into the country, Crowley said. High-resolution images of damage . Maj. Gen. Dan Allyn, the U.S. commander of the Haiti task force, told reporters that Haiti should see some ""initial operating capacity"" at its ports by the end of the week -- including the capability of bringing in fuel needed to take trucks into more remote areas. Additionally, he said that officials were looking into the possibility of opening an airstrip at the city of Jacmel ""to relieve some of the immediate pressure on Port-au-Prince airfield."" Cassandra Nelson, spokeswoman for Mercy Corps, which has a long-standing program in Haiti, said that aid is clearly increasing daily, but much more needs to be done. ""Operations here have been an incredible challenge, and Mercy Corps has done emergency response for years and years and is very seasoned,"" she said. ""[But] we have to say this is probably one of the hardest ones we've had. ""We are working out of an office. Right now our office is overflowing. It's a place where we all sleep, we all eat granola bars, and we all do our work there."" Full coverage | Twitter updates . A more-than-welcome sight arrives off Haiti Wednesday morning: the U.S. Naval Ship Comfort, a state-of-the-art hospital ship that saw duty during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 in New Orleans and the 2001 terror attacks in New York, among others. The ship, which can house up to 1,000 patients, brings with it more than 1,000 medical and support personnel. But on the ground, caregivers struggle to provide the kind of care their patients need. Dr. Robert Fuller of the International Medical Corps, a group of volunteer medical personnel, said that his group is hoping to have intensive-care units in ""a handful of days."" ""Things are coming together, but it is certainly not the way it is back home,"" he said. ""Right now we have seven operating rooms up and running on the campus. We could really use 20 probably. At times we run so low on medications that it gets difficult to know whether we will continue to operate."" Dr. Mark Hyman from Partners in Health, which also has a long-standing program in Haiti, said the military effort to get Haiti running again is working, but the need is simply unimaginable. ""Look, there's hundreds of thousands of patients that are injured,"" he said. ""There's hundreds of thousands of others that have been killed probably, that we haven't even accounted for, and there's 150 nurses buried a few feet from here in the rubble of the nursing building."" And even those military personnel on the ground were spread widely. Brig. Gen. Floriano Peixoto, force commander of the Brazilian troops who make up the U.N. command in Haiti, said his soldiers were there to do whatever is needed. ""We understand that the country deserves more in terms of humanitarian aid and security, but our forces are dedicated to different fronts, including aid, security, search or bodies, recovery of missing people,"" he said. ""It's a large amount of tasks to be done.""","Capital's airport, country's roads and ports were devastated by last week's earthquake .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- As many of you already know -- because Tweets travel faster than airplanes -- Kevin Smith, the portly film director of the movie ""Clerks"" and the upcoming film ""Cop Out,"" was ""politely"" asked to disembark from his Southwest flight from Oakland to Burbank because he was too large to fit in the seat. Okay, let's be frank: He was kicked off the flight. The reason he was given was that his size infringed upon the space of the person sitting next to him and it could cause a safety risk in case of an emergency. Does it surprise you that an airline that has charged a customer several hundred dollars for the service of transporting him from one place to another would subject said paying customer to the indignity of being told he's too fat to fly? I don't think it does. Because this is what flying has become: barely one rung above bus travel. Southwest may have apologized to Smith, but what about the rest of us? Scratch the surface of any frequent flier and you will find a raging cauldron of resentment (or endless angry tweets, like Smiths), a bottomless pit of despair and rage with no hope of satisfaction because, after all, fliers have no choice but to accept every humiliation if they want to fly. Most of us don't have our own planes -- or fly business class. Myself, I'm old enough to remember when flying used to be fun -- but not quite old enough to remember when people used to ""dress"" to fly. But they did. It was an event to go on an airplane. Like going to a Broadway show. Pretty ladies with hats and smiling men in uniforms would bring you snacks, blankets and pillows. Beverages in real glasses. But at some point, the airlines started to lose money, started charging more and giving you less in return. The tragedy of 9/11 hastened the end of any kind of special treatment. Boarding became a cattle call -- complete with prodding with a stick -- where you had to basically undress before you could get on the plane, take off shoes, coats, sweaters, get ""wanded,"" step out of the line for frisking, and other debasements too horrible to mention. Soon they will be swabbing your hands for explosives. Really! I know one woman whose underwire bra had security stumped. (I have to check a bag just for the hair products for my frizzy hair; they don't come in less than three ounces.) By the time you get on the plane, you are like a refugee -- the tired, the poor, the huddled masses in middle seats. Flight attendants can't dote on you any more, they are too busy scanning the group for potential terrorists. No more meals -- bad as they were -- no more cutlery. If you're lucky, something called a ""snack mix"" in a bag is thrown at you, making you beg for more water. And less and less room. If you drop something on the floor, you can't reach it without putting your face in the lap of the person sitting next to you. It makes you long for the fat days (you'll pardon the expression) of People Express, that 1980's no-frills airline that operated out of Newark. It seemed pretty terrible back then, but really it was just a preview -- every man for himself. Basically anything you got during the flight, you paid extra for. When they did the safety announcement at the beginning, I would wait for the day they'd say, ""In case of an emergency, please pay two dollars and fifty cents to have an oxygen mask drop above your seat."" (Ha ha ha, right? Don't give them any ideas.) But you flew with them, because they were so cheap. Now I'm wondering if that's a good enough reason anymore. How much can a body take, even a skinny one like mine? Kevin Smith, I feel your pain! I cringe for the person who has to sheepishly ask for the seat belt extender because the one in the narrow little seat doesn't make it around his body. The world is not built for fat people, and airplanes are not the place to look for gentle treatment. I will not be surprised when airlines start to weigh people's luggage at the ticket counter, and then ask the traveler to get on the scale and be charged by the pound. It's coming, you watch. Or they will have bench seats on the airplanes, measure people as they board, and seat them accordingly. If a fat person has to pay extra to fly -- Smith usually buys two seats on Southwest because they don't have first class -- then this could be a precedent for more suffering in the world away from the tarmac. A fat person will have to pay extra for a larger size in clothing. Or pay more for an all-you-can-eat buffet. Or pay extra to use an elevator. But what do I know? I was just turned down for health insurance because I have a history of anorexia. Well, that's what they said. I know why they really turned me down: It's because I'm fat. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Cathy Ladman .","Cathy Ladman laments Kevin Smith's getting bumped from a flight because of his size .

"(CNN) -- Peru's ancient Inca ruins of Machu Picchu should reopen April 1, more than two months after rain stranded hundreds of tourists at the popular spot, the government said. Heavy rain in January unleashed mudslides that cut off roads and blocked a rail line between Machu Picchu and the nearby city of Cusco. Water levels at the Vilcanota River have receded enough to allow repairs to the rail line, said Martin Perez, head of Peru's Ministry of Exterior Commerce and Tourism. ""We expect that starting April 1, we will start to receive the millions of tourists who always have come,"" he said Tuesday. Peruvian officials were forced to use helicopters to evacuate more than 1,000 stranded tourists last month.

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- Prominent Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo, who was arrested in 1989 for his role in the Tiananmen Square protest, faces trial Wednesday for allegedly ""inciting subversion"" in a more recent case. Liu, a former university lecturer and literary critic, faces a possible 15-year jail sentence, amid growing international outrage over his yearlong detention, according to media reports. The trial begins Wednesday at 9 a.m. local time (Tuesday 8 p.m. ET). On Monday, the Times of London quoted Liu's wife, Liu Xia, as saying, ""I have no hope whatsoever, I can't even attend the trial."" She said she planned to wait outside the courthouse. ""I think he will be sentenced to more than ten years,"" she said. Liu, 53, was detained on December 8, 2008, and held under ""residential surveillance"" as police investigated the case, according to the PEN American Center, a U.S. literary and human rights organization. On June 23 of this year, he was arrested and charged with inciting subversion of state power, the organization said. Liu is on the PEN board of directors. The case was turned over to the prosecutor's office December 8 -- one year from the time Liu was detained. Liu co-authored Charter 08, ""a declaration calling for political reform, greater human rights, and an end to one-party rule in China that has been signed by hundreds of individuals from all walks of life throughout the country,"" PEN says on its Web site. The group said Liu was arrested before the formal release of Charter 08. ""Liu has been engaged in agitation activities, such as spreading of rumors and defaming of the government, aimed at subversion of the state and overthrowing the socialism system in recent years,"" according to a police statement reported by China's state-run Xinhua news agency. The statement claimed Liu confessed to the charge during a preliminary police investigation. Liu served as an adviser to student leaders during the demonstrations at Tiananmen Square in 1989. Along with three other intellectuals, he took part in hunger strikes there on June 2 of that year prior to the crackdown to show support for the flagging student protests. He was arrested two days after the Tiananmen crackdown and was released in 1991. In May 1995 he was detained again for collecting signatures for a petition calling for human rights guarantees. The U.S. government has pressed for Liu's release. ""The U.S. government is deeply disturbed by reports that Liu Xiaobo has been formally arrested and charged with serious crimes,"" said Richard Buangan, deputy spokesman at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, following Liu's latest arrest. ""We call on the government of China to release Mr. Liu and respect the rights of all Chinese citizens who peacefully express their desire for internationally recognized freedoms.""","Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo faces trial Wednesday .

"London, England (CNN) -- British police said Wednesday they have arrested a BBC television presenter on suspicion of murder after he told viewers he carried out a so-called mercy killing on a former lover. Ray Gosling, 70, a freelance broadcaster, admitted on a BBC show aired in central England that he had smothered the unnamed partner in hospital where he was being treated for AIDS. Assisting in another person's death is illegal in England. Police in Nottinghamshire, 160 kilometers (100 miles) north of London, confirmed they had made an arrest after the apparent confession on the BBC's ""Inside Out"" show. Gosling made his admission in a taped segment of a 30-minute show about death, recounting how he smothered his partner to end his ""terrible, terrible pain."" He told viewers: ""Maybe this is the time to share a secret that I have kept for quite a long time. I killed someone once. ""He was a young chap, he'd been my lover and he got AIDS. ""In a hospital one hot afternoon, the doctor said 'There's nothing we can do,' and he was in terrible, terrible pain. ""I picked up the pillow and smothered him until he was dead. The doctor came back and I said 'He's gone'. Nothing more was ever said."" Gosling, who has not revealed details of his former lover's identity or the exact date of the incident, insisted he was not ""making a cause"" of assisted dying. In a BBC Radio interview he said: ""Sometimes doctors do it on their own. Sometimes people do it on their own. ""And if it happens to a lover or friend of yours, a husband, a wife, and I hope it doesn't, but when it does sometimes you have to do brave things and you have to say - to use Nottingham language - bugger the law.""","Ray Gosling admitted on a television show that he killed his former lover .

"(CNN) -- Authorities are no longer able to watch a video of scenes at a Georgia nightclub in the case of Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger because a digital video recorder system recorded over it, an attorney said Thursday. Roethlisberger, who has been the starting quarterback for the Steelers for six seasons, has been accused of sexually assaulting a 20-year-old woman at a Georgia nightspot this month. He has not been charged. Roethlisberger's attorney has said, ""The facts show that there was no criminal activity."" Police were hoping to use the recording to glean any details and insights about the sequence of events surrounding the alleged incident, which was said to have occurred in a restroom. Carl Cansino, the attorney representing the Capital City nightclub, said police were able to see a small portion of the recording, and the club manager said he saw the entire video. Cansino said the club manager said the club's dance floor and entrance were in the recording during the night of the alleged assault, but he couldn't discern anything out of the ordinary.

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- The passage of health care will certainly rank as one of the major political achievements of recent decades. Legislation that will eventually extend health care coverage to more than 30 million more Americans, greatly expand the number of options that citizens have when purchasing health care, bring healthy citizens into the pool of the insured and thus lower costs and create important regulations on health care companies will be remembered as one of the biggest domestic policy changes since the Great Society of the 1960s. While most attention will focus on President Obama for pulling off a Herculean task that eluded many of our great presidents, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi emerges from this battle as the real powerhouse in Washington. She has pursued a clear ideological agenda but through pragmatic political tactics. Like the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, she stands for something, yet knows how to round up votes. Since the 2008 election, Pelosi has been the most reliable leader Democrats have had. She has delivered on almost all of the legislation that the White House sent to Congress, even as her colleagues found themselves frustrated by a Senate that seemed incapable of governance. At three critical points in the health care debate, Pelosi delivered. First, she assembled a center-left coalition around the original House bill in November by pushing through a controversial amendment related to abortion that brought moderate Democrats on board with the legislation. Second, when many Democrats, including top presidential advisers such as Rahm Emanuel, contemplated breaking up the bill after the Massachusetts election, Pelosi stood firm and defended holistic reform. She ""kept the steel in the President's back,"" Democrat Rep. Anna Eshoo told Politico. Finally, in the past week she displayed the kind of vote-gathering skills that have been displayed by legendary figures such as Speaker Sam Rayburn of Texas. From the start of Obama's presidency, Pelosi has argued that Democrats should focus on maintaining partisan unity rather than on achieving bipartisan coalitions. She has implored her colleagues to act with confidence rather than out of fear. Her goal has always been to find ways to keep Democrats together rather than bringing Republicans on board. In an era where partisan polarization makes true bipartisanship impossible, this is the most effective and realistic approach for Democrats. Her philosophy echoes the beliefs of another powerful leader who said: ""Show me a nation without partisanship, and I'll show you a tyranny. For all its faults, it is partisanship, based on core principles, that clarifies our debates, that prevents one party from straying too far from the mainstream and that constantly refreshes our politics with new ideas and new leaders."" That was from a farewell statement by Republican Majority Leader Tom DeLay. Although Americans tend to focus on the presidency and give credit to the office for what does or does not happen, we often ignore the central role that Congress plays. During the 1930s and 1960s, legislators were essential to the success of the New Deal and Great Society, often pushing Presidents Roosevelt and Johnson in directions they were too scared to take. Rather than the cartoonish caricature that Republicans often use of Pelosi as a left coast, left-wing fanatic, she is something much more powerful -- and threatening to their party. When Kennedy died, many Democrats wondered who would take his place as the party's deal-maker. Now they have their answer. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","After Democrats lost 60-vote Senate majority, some wanted to scale back health bill .

"(CNN) -- A sex tape allegedly showing former Sen. John Edwards survived a fire that torched a North Carolina courthouse on Thursday. Actually, the tape that was the subject of a February court hearing at the historic Chatham County Courthouse was not at the courthouse during the blaze, city officials said. The tape, said to show Edwards and his former mistress Rielle Hunter, had been moved to another facility, said Debora Henzey, community relations director for Chatham County. Seven fire departments responded to the blaze at the courthouse in downtown Pittsboro about 4:45 p.m. Thursday. It took firefighters hours to quell the blaze, which severely damaged the courthouse. In February, the courthouse was the scene of the legal battle over the sex tape, with Hunter suing for its return. At the hearing, Judge Abraham Penn Jones found former Edwards aide Andrew Young and his wife, Cheri, in civil contempt of court and ordered them to hand over the tape to the court. In court documents, the Youngs had said that the video showed ""Senator Edwards engaged in sexual activities with a woman who, from all indications, is not his wife and who the Youngs believe to be Ms. Hunter, based upon her appearance."" In January, Edwards admitted that he had fathered a child with Hunter, a videographer who worked on his 2008 presidential campaign. Edwards had publicly denied paternity for more than a year. About a week after his admission, he confirmed reports that he had legally separated from his wife, Elizabeth. Those announcements came just before Andrew Young released an embarrassing book about the Edwardses and his campaign.

"(CNN)  -- A Utah man trapped for more than 26 hours in a crevice of a popular cave tourist attraction died as rescuers struggled to save him, authorities said Thursday. John Edward Jones, 26, of Stansbury Park was stuck in the Nutty Putty Cave, which sits west of Utah Lake near Cedar Valley, according to the sheriff's office of Utah County. The cave is 55 to 60 miles south of Salt Lake City. Sheriff's officials said Jones entered the cave at around 6 p.m. Tuesday with a group of about 11 people and became stuck about 8:45 p.m. in a ""tightly confined"" feature inside Nutty Putty Cave called ""Bob's Push."" Utah County sheriff's spokesman Sgt. Spencer Cannon told CNN affiliate KSL that Jones was trapped upside down in a crevice that was about 18 inches wide and about 10 inches high. The crevice is about 150 feet below the surface and about 700 feet from the cave entrance, according to the sheriff's department. ""They had him to a level spot where he wasn't heading downhill with his head below his feet,"" Cannon said. ""During the course of that, they have a raising system to hold him in position, and one of the devices of that system failed, and Mr. Jones actually fell back to the area where he had been stuck for so long."" Shortly before midnight on Wednesday, rescuers got close enough to Jones to conclude that he was not breathing and he had no pulse. Rescue officials were meeting Thursday to determine how to recover Jones' body. Rescuers had tried to reach Jones for more than 24 hours, but had problems navigating the treacherous terrain, Cannon said. ""Getting people to him is very difficult,"" Cannon told KSL before Jones died. ""It is a tightly confined space. When there is movement, it is literally millimeters at a time."" There are narrow areas of the cave where visitors have to crawl on their bellies to get through, according to the attraction's Web site. Up to 5,000 people visit each year, the site said.","John Edward Jones was stuck in cave crevice outside Salt Lake City .

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- An Islamic court in northern Nigeria has prohibited a human rights group from using social networking Web sites to discuss amputations as punishment, court records show. The court in Kaduna city ordered the Civil Rights Congress of Nigeria not to have forums on Twitter, Facebook or other sites discussing the 2000 punishment of Mallam Bello Jangebe, whose right hand was amputated for stealing. ""It's the 10th anniversary of the amputation -- and we wanted to mark the anniversary by opening the discussion,"" said Shehu Sani, president of the Civil Rights Congress. ""We reject and condemn the ban, and plan to challenge it in a higher court."" The group opened the discussion on some sites last week. Sani said the court was concerned that the forums would criticize Sharia law. ""But we just wanted to use it to get views,"" he said. Jangebe's hand was cut off after he was convicted of stealing a cow, according to a report by Amnesty International. The decision by Kaduna court Monday came after the Association of Muslim Brotherhood group decried planned forums in a lawsuit last week.

"Decatur, Georgia (CNN)  -- LaShonda Durden had just given birth to her second child. She was two weeks back from maternity leave when her supervisor called her into her office. ""You need to be trying to find other employment,"" her manager said. A bereavement coordinator and chaplain at an Atlanta, Georgia-area hospice, Durden suddenly found herself coping with the grief of being unemployed. Sixteen months later, she's still out of work. ""It's a vicious cycle,"" she says. Durden is not alone. She is among the 16.5 percent unemployed African-Americans -- almost twice the rate of unemployment for whites. The figure was included in a new report released Wednesday on the state of black America by the National Urban League. The report presents other sobering statistics on the nation's racial divide on economics, education, health, civic engagement and social justice. Among them: . The median household income for blacks stands at $34,218; for whites, it's $55,530. Less than half of blacks own a home compared to three quarters of white families. Blacks are more than three times as likely to live in poverty. In addition, black-owned businesses represent a paltry 5 percent of privately owned companies, and the study says more are needed to help spur job growth in minority communities. The Obama administration, the study suggests, has taken measures to improve the gap between whites and blacks, although it says more is needed. The report says legislation needs to focus on minority job training, tax incentives and extensions for unemployment benefits. Andrew Grant-Thomas, the deputy director of the Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity, says he believes the statistics for unemployed black Americans is far greater than what's being reported. The figures don't include people not actively seeking employment or people with higher education degrees forced to take jobs for which they're overqualified. ""The disparities are definitely huge and that number understates the size of the disparity,"" he says. ""You want to take that number and double it."" ""This recession is even bigger than Katrina hitting New Orleans,"" he adds. ""Yes, everyone got hit, but not everyone was hit equally as hard -- and shouldn't we invest in those hit the hardest?"" The faces of the statistics . On Tuesday, Durden went to Java DeLight Cafe, in a predominantly African-American suburb of Atlanta. She goes there to network and search for jobs via the Internet over its WiFi connection. The cafe  is owned and operated by Patricia Setzer, an African-American who opened the establishment in 2008. She says she can relate to many of her customers. Days after she opened her business, her husband was laid off. It took him eight months to find a new job. ""We literally just went without for awhile,"" she says. Setzer hopes her cafe can serve as a networking hub. She calls it ""the cultural meeting place."" If her regular customers don't return for weeks, she wonders if they've succumbed to hard times: ""When they're not here, I'm thinking about them."" ""We want people to come here and meet and enjoy themselves,"" Setzer says. To that end, she's organizing a job club at her cafe -- a place to host unemployed Americans (of any ethnicity) and give them hands on training, from resume help to how to dress for interviews. Barbers and hair stylists will be on hand for those who need fresh cuts. As a business owner, Setzer is a minority in a minority: Just 5.2 percent of small businesses in the U.S. are black-owned. ""We're all struggling, whether you're white, black or green,"" says Setzer as she flips turkey patties. ""You've just got to hold on."" On this day, Diane Ridley Roberts, president of a management consulting firm, worked from her laptop inside the cafe. Unlike other businesses that aren't hiring, she says she's having trouble finding qualified people. Ridley Roberts, an African-American, says there is no homogenous state of black America. ""To say we're all in one boat is a little naive, I think,"" says the owner of Global Evaluation & Applied Research Solutions. But she adds that there are common experiences that only black Americans can fully relate. Even in 2010, she says, she feels she has to doubly prove herself when she is awarded a contract. ""There are certain judgments, ideas and perceptions about me when I walk into the door as someone's consultant,"" she says. ""It is what it is."" An unexpected job interview . Sipping coffee at a table in the cafe, Durden talks about all manner of difficulty -- from her work as a hospice chaplain to her own layoff and struggle. She's turned her joblessness into action: She volunteers monthly to help the homeless. It's a reminder, she says, that her family ""could be worse off."" ""And that's the blessing for me -- just knowing that I am sustained,"" she says, ""that even if the bottom falls out, God still has us in His hands."" She sends out her resume at least three days a week. She attends job fairs about every two weeks. Those get discouraging, she says, with 400 people jockeying for one position. She holds a sociology degree from Georgia State University and went on to seminary school. At this point, she'll take anything to help her family. And that's another part of the job hunt. She's overqualified for many positions and often wonders: ""Do I dumb down my resume?"" ""I have a passion to help people do better than they're doing now, regardless of where they are in life,"" she says. ""I just love people."" As for her African-American roots, she says, ""It means I expect to excel in what I do because I know who my foremothers and forefathers are. ""Being black in America right now, for me, it means hope. It means keeping that hope when some others may not be able to."" Durden piqued the interest of one person in the cafe. Overhearing Durden's story, Ridley Roberts asks if she has a resume. Durden pulls out her flash drive and downloads a copy. The two then leave the cafe. The impromptu job interview is Durden's best lead in a while. That's the life of the jobless: Networking and constantly searching, even on the fly.

"Washington (CNN) -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned Thursday that a ""new information curtain is descending across much of the world."" In a speech on Internet freedom and security, Clinton also urged China to investigate a wave of cyber attacks against Google and other companies. The Internet and other technologies are critical to foreign policy, and those who engage in cyber attacks should face international condemnation, she said. ""In an interconnected world, an attack on one nation's networks can be an attack on all,"" she said at The Newseum in Washington. Clinton made the comments as search-engine giant Google threatened to shut down its operations in China, five years after agreeing to allow some censorship in exchange for the right to work in that country's massive emerging technology market. Google charges that Chinese hackers have targeted Google and up to 34 other companies. The Chinese government argues that the Google case is a business dispute and should not affect overall relations between the two countries. Clinton has said that Google's allegations of censorship and online attacks by China raise ""very serious concerns,"" and her agency has said it will file a formal protest over the company's complaints. Also this month, foreign correspondents in at least two Chinese bureaus of news organizations had their Google e-mail accounts attacked, with e-mails forwarded to a mysterious address, according to the Foreign Correspondents' Club of China. Clinton warned that the latest information technology -- designed to open access to governments -- can also be used by some governments to ""crush dissent and deny human rights."" ""In the last year, we've seen a spike in threats to the free flow of information. China, Tunisia and Uzbekistan have stepped up their censorship of the Internet,"" she said. ""In Vietnam, access to popular social networking sites has suddenly disappeared. And last Friday in Egypt, 30 bloggers and activists were detained."" A member of that group, having since been freed, was in the audience, Clinton said. ""So while it is clear that the spread of these technologies is transforming our world, it is still unclear how that transformation will affect the human rights and welfare of much of the world's population,"" she said. ""The same networks that help organize movements for freedom also enable al Qaeda to spew hatred and incite violence against the innocent,"" Clinton said. Some governments also have ""co-opted"" the Internet to silence ""people of faith,"" Clinton said. ""Last year in Saudi Arabia, a man spent months in prison for blogging about Christianity,"" she said. Countries such as Vietnam and China have used similar tactics to ""restrict access to religious information."" The State Department will convene a high-level meeting next month of firms that provide network services for talks on Internet freedom, she said. Citizens and businesses must be able to rely on the security of information networks, Clinton said. ""Our ability to bank online, use electronic commerce and safeguard billions of dollars in intellectual property are all at stake if we cannot rely on the security of information networks,"" she said. Referring to social and economic development, Clinton said the Internet can serve as a ""great equalizer."" By providing people with access to knowledge and potential markets, networks can create opportunity where none exist. ""Over the last year, I've seen this first hand in Kenya, where farmers have seen their income grow by as much as 30 percent since they started using mobile banking technology,"" Clinton said. Information technology has been a great help in addressing the staggering problems in Haiti, she said, pointing to a young girl and two women who were pulled from the rubble after they sent a text message for help. The text message campaign to raise money for Haiti has raised more than $25 million for recovery efforts, Clinton said. Each texter was asked to donate $10, and the State Department said Wednesday that it is believed to be the largest amount raised for the country through a mobile phone campaign. CNN's Jill Dougherty and Doug Gross contributed to this report.","Hillary Clinton says a cyber attack on one nation is an attack on all .

"JAMAICA PLAIN, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Lucy Valena is hooked on coffee. Lucy Valena went to Seattle to learn from the best baristas before opening her Boston espresso company. ""I had my first shot of espresso when I was 14,"" she says. ""And it was pretty amazing for me."" With the dream of opening a coffee house, Valena -- a 24-year-old artist -- went to Seattle, Washington, to learn at the aprons of the best. ""The first time I went into a cafe, I saw someone pour the leaf, the rosetta, on top of a latte, and I'll never forget, I just saw that barista pour that rosetta and I said, 'I'm not leaving this town until I learn how to do that.' "" Valena returned to Boston, Massachusetts, and launched Voltage Coffee, a mobile espresso catering company, last fall. ""When I was in Seattle, I kind of was amazed by this kind of wired culture that they have going on there. People are just obsessed,"" Valena says. ""They just make this amazing coffee and are just really caffeinated and just getting stuff done. It's a very exciting place to be. ""So when I moved back to Boston, I really wanted to kind of bring that energy back with me in a way. And Voltage Coffee is a way to bring that on the road and bring it into other peoples' environments instead of bringing them into a separate place.

Her corporate headquarters is her bedroom, and she wrote her business plan ""with all these Business Plan Writing for Dummies books,"" she says. Valena then took her plan to the Small Business Administration and was directed to Accion USA, a company specializing in microloans. Accion had just begun a partnership with the Boston Beer Company -- brewer of Samuel Adams beers -- to help small food and beverage businesses get funding and free advice. ""I love Lucy's dedication to the quality of her product,"" says Samuel Adams founder Jim Koch. ""I'm a big believer that a great product, and the passion that an entrepreneur brings to that, can carry a long way if you have a helping hand. ""Lucy stands out as an entrepreneur because she's got a lot of energy, she's got a huge amount of passion for coffee, for her product. And she does wonderful things about quality.

Now she's focused on opening a storefront. But she has to incorporate, find a space and get a loan. ""I need to convince someone to give me 180 grand,"" she says. ""That's a good chunk of change.""

"Las Vegas, Nevada (CNN) -- For all the buzz about ""tablet computers"" in recent weeks, one fundamental question about this supposedly break-through computer category remains unanswered: . What exactly is a tablet? Computer industry representatives here at the massive and hype-heavy Consumer Electronics Show can't seem to agree. Some say a computer just needs a touch-sensitive screen to be a tablet. Others say a person should be able to write on it with a pen. Still others say it's screen size that's important -- tablets must fit somewhere between phones and laptops. For Philip McKinney, vice president and chief technology officer at Hewlett-Packard, it's partly the keyboard -- a tablet should have one of those. Break off the keyboard, leaving only a touch-screen device, he said, and the gadget falls into another buzz-worthy category: the slate. Others say the terms slate and tablet are synonymous. So what's a confused consumer to do? And how can anyone judge the many products here that claim to be from tabletland when there's no consensus on what one is? Simple. Just get over the name, said Steve Baker, vice-president of industry analysis at the NDP Group, a market research firm. Computer makers are introducing a shotgun spray of newish -- or at least newly named -- products in hopes that one will be a big recession-era hit with consumers, he said. None of these new devices, which he said are characterized only by their medium size, fix any obvious problem consumers have with their current computers, he said. Companies are releasing these new products without knowing exactly why consumers would want to use them, he said. ""That's the problem, but the exciting part of it is that we really don't know what the right product is for people -- what they want to do with this."" Hot products . The tablet buzz at CES is somewhat overshadowed by a tablet that Apple is rumored to announce later this month. Still, the array of tablet-esque devices here is getting tons of attention from show attendees. The two most talked-about tablets at CES are Lenovo's IdeaPad U1, which the company refers to not as a tablet but as a ""hybrid-notebook;"" and a yet-to-be named and largely unseen ""slate"" tablet from HP. Lenovo's device looks like a smallish laptop on first glance. But the screen on the gadget pops off of a plastic shell and can be carried around separately from its keyboard. That's the tablet part of the hybrid. When separated from its keyboard home, the slender touch-screen tablet -- which looks like a stretched-out iPhone -- is well suited for watching movies, browsing photos and reading books, said Michael Littler, who markets the device. The touch-sensitive screen, made possible by Microsoft's Windows 7, lets users spin photos and scroll through text with their fingers, which might seem more intuitive than a pushing a computer mouse. Watch CES attendees get acquainted with the dual laptop-tablet . That product will debut in six months and will cost less than $1,000, Littler said. Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer briefly trotted out HP's unnamed ""slate"" device during his opening keynote address at the show, stirring up lots of interest. The device was thin and flat, without a keyboard, and with a touch-sensitive screen. HP decided not to show off the unnamed product at CES, however. McKinney, the company's CTO, said the HP slate has been in development for five years and will be sold to consumers sometime in 2010. He would not discuss the product's price or provide further specifics. Tablet origins . Part of the tablet confusion comes from the fact that the term is not new. In the 90s, Microsoft and others introduced tablet PCs with swivel-around screens and keyboards. Consumers couldn't touch the screens with their fingers to control the tablets, but many had stylus pens that let people write on the screen. While popular in niche markets, those older-generation tablets never took off like expected, said Lance Ulanoff, editor in chief of PC Magazine. ""I think major companies are still a little hesitant to go all-in,"" he said. Why now? The current resurgence of the tablet term -- and the mid-sized, touch-screen gadgets that go with it -- appears to have several precipitating factors. First, said Ulanoff, is the popularity of the iPhone. Apple's smartphone showed people how helpful touch-screen technology can be. ""I think people got the idea that -- 'Well, what if [the iPhone] was bigger?"" he said. Next is the recession. Consumer electronics sales were down considerably in 2009. That gives computer companies an incentive to try some potentially wacky ideas in an effort to differentiate themselves from competitors, said Baker, the industry analyst. Technological advances are also pushing the idea. Windows 7, which Microsoft released last year, incorporates touch-screen technology, and many people consider to be a cornerstone of the tablet experience. Also throw in a truckload of hype about Apple's rumored tablet. Tech blogs have been drooling over the supposed announcement for months. And, while tablet makers here say they've been working on the technology for years, several admitted the Apple tablet buzz doesn't hurt their efforts. People expect everything Apple makes to be sexy and popular. And that could rub off on an entire category of devices. What's in a name? The flurry of newly named computer products, however, could have negative consequences for the tablet computer industry, said Ken Lee, vice-president of sales and marketing at viliv, another tablet maker exhibiting at CES. The industry is on the verge of confusing consumers so much that they won't know what products they do or don't want, he said. Still, he added, it's exciting to work in a time of experimentation. Viliv is focusing on a number of mid-size computing devices -- from its $500 N5 ""clamshell"" device, which looks like a sunglasses case when it's closed and is small enough to fit in a coat pocket; to a $550 S10 tablet with a swivel touch-screen and a keyboard; and, finally, a soon-to-be-unveiled ""media slate,"" which has an 10-inch touch-screen and no keyboard. The names are important from a marketing perspective, he said. Viliv didn't call its ""media slate"" a tablet because that name sounds expensive, he said. The company didn't want to call it a plain old slate either, he said, because that sounded heavy, like slate rock, when the media slate is actually rather light. Slate also sounds industrial, he said, and he wants this media-consumption device to be fun. ""We tried to give it a little bit more of a casual, lighter feeling,"" he said. Other companies have introduced mid-sized, pseudo-tablet products under a host of names -- smartbooks, mini-notes, touch-screen netbooks, dual-book e-readers that also surf the Web. At its CES product office this week, Littler, from Lenovo, was commenting on this development when a woman abruptly joined the conversation. ""I just call it a computer,"" she said.","Tablet computers get buzz at CES, but people disagree about what they are .
Most are characterized by their size: They are smaller than laptops and bigger than phones .

"(CNN) -- A 5.8-magnitude earthquake struck Tuesday off the Cayman Islands, the U.S. Geological Survey said. The 6.2-mile deep quake hit at 9:23 a.m. ET, 40 miles from George Town, Cayman Islands, the USGS reported. George Town, the capital, is on the western shore of Grand Cayman Island. There were no immediate reports of injuries in the three-island chain in the Caribbean. The British territory of the Cayman Islands is about 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) west of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, which was devastated last week by a 7.0-magnitude earthquake. Tuesday's quake struck about 32 miles (52 kilometers) east-southeast of Bodden Town in the center of the southern coast of Grand Cayman Island. Are you in the Cayman Islands? Share photos, video . It caused shaking at the Pedro St. James National Historic Site, about a 10-minute drive from Bodden Town, said Sonya Hydes, the gift shop manager. ""There was quite a bit of shaking,"" she said. Hydes said she called her husband after the shaking stopped to see if their house was affected. He told her that he felt the quake but that it did not damage their house. There are reports that the quake toppled power lines in Bodden Town, said Kafara Augustine, a news producer for Cayman 27. Augustine said she felt the shaking from within her office in central George Town. She and her colleagues quickly evacuated the building, seeking safety in the streets, she said. The two-story building did not suffer any damage and from what she could see, everything else seemed unharmed during the quake, she said. The quake startled Davy Ebanks, general manager of the North Sound Club, a golf course on the Seven Mile Beach strip of western Grand Cayman Island. He said he was reading about the earthquake in Haiti on the Internet when he suddenly felt shaking. ""I just bolted,"" he said. ""It was rocking and rolling pretty good."" The trembling knocked some picture frames off balance and sent some mannequins tumbling in the pro shop, but otherwise did little damage at the club, he said. About 215 miles (346 kilometers) from the temblor in Cienfuegos, Cuba -- a city on the southern coast of the communist island -- residents said they felt nothing. The Caymans are about 167 (268 kilometers) miles northwest of Jamaica and about 140 miles (240 kilometers) south of Cuba, according to the CIA World Fact Book. CNN's Mark Bixler and Shasta Darlington contributed to this report.","No immediate reports of injuries after earthquake off Cayman Islands .

"(CNN) -- The number of girls being raped has increased sharply since fighting intensified in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a humanitarian group said Tuesday. A survey of children at refugee camps finds rapes of girls under age 17 are increasing. Also, the recent fighting between rebels and the Congo government has heightened the threat of children being recruited as soldiers, said World Vision. ""A silent war has been waged against women and children,"" said Sue Mbaya, the humanitarian group's Africa advocacy director. ""Women and girls in the hundreds have been targets of opportunistic and brutal rape, while children are also being targeted for recruitment or re-recruitment as child soldiers."" World Vision said they surveyed children at six refugee camps in the country, finding that 120 girls under the age of 17 reported being raped in October. That's compared to five reported cases in April and June. Mbaya was scheduled to address the issue Tuesday during a report to the United Nations Security Council. The fighting, which began in August, prompted the U.N. Security Council to approve sending more than 3,000 troops in coming weeks to bolster the 17,000-strong peacekeeping force already there. A U.N. envoy has also been sent to Congo to conduct peace talks between the government and rebel leader Laurent Nkunda. The spiraling violence in eastern Congo has displaced an estimated 250,000 people -- many of whom have fled to refugee camps. The fighting is spurred by lingering tensions over the 1994 slaughter of ethnic Tutsis by majority Hutus in neighboring Rwanda. Nkunda has said his forces are fighting to defend Congolese Tutsis from Hutu militants who escaped to Congo.","Aid group says rape reports increase as fighting intensified .

"(CNN) -- World No. 2 Novak Djokovic suffered a shock defeat by sixth seed Mikhail Youzhny in the semifinals of the World Tennis Tournament in Rotterdam on Saturday. The Serbian, who had not played since Thursday after being handed a walkover in his quarterfinal, lost 7-6 (7-5) 7-6 (8-6) to the Russian despite saving two match-points. Youzhny, who won the Dutch indoor tournament in 2007, will play second seed Robin Soderling in Sunday's final after the world No. 8 edged out sixth-ranked Nikolay Davydenko 7-6 (7-3) 6-4. Youzhny will have the chance to avenge his compatriot's defeat as he seeks to improve his 1-1 career record against Soderling. The signs are good for the world No. 20, who also defeated Djokovic in the semifinals three years ago. The Muscovite will bid to win his sixth ATP Tour title, having won one in each of the past three seasons. Soderling has bounced back from a poor start to the season that saw the Swede lose in the first round of his first two tournaments in 2010, including the Australian Open. ""This is a really tough tournament and it's not easy to reach the final here,"" last year's French Open finalist told the ATP Web site. ""I'm playing better with every match, so I'm very happy. I've had a lot of tough matches with Nikolay in the past few years. He's one of the best players in the world, so it means I am playing great tennis to beat him. My confidence is up and I'm looking forward to the final."" Meanwhile, second seed Fernando Verdasco reached the final of the SAP Open in San Jose in the United States after beating Uzbekistan's Denis Istomin on Saturday. The Spaniard won 6-3 2-6 6-4 to set up a clash with the top seed Andy Roddick who overcame a first set loss and two tiebreakers to defeat fellow American Sam Querrey 2-6, 7-6 (5), 7-6 (4). Top seed Elena Dementieva will play Lucie Safarova in Sunday's Paris Indoor Open final on the women's WTA Tour circuit. Russian world No. 7 Dementieva came from behind to beat young American Melanie Oudin 4-6 6-3 6-3 in the semifinals of the French hardcourt event, where she lost in the final last year to Amelie Mauresmo. Unseeded Czech Safarova upset Italy's Flavia Pennetta, the second-ranked player in the field, as she also rallied from a set down to win 4-6 6-3 6-4. World No. 46 Safarova lost to Nadia Petrova in the 2007 final. In Thailand, top seed Vera Zvonareva will seek home hope Tamarine Tanasugarn from winning her first Pattaya Open title on Sunday. The Russian is on course to defend her title following a 6-2 4-6 6-3 victory against fourth seed Yaroslava Shvedova of Kazakhstan, reaching her 21st career title. The 32-year-old Tanasugarn will have her 10th tilt at a WTA title after crushing Shvedova's compatriot Sesil Karatantcheva, ranked 185th in the world, 6-2 6-0 in the other semifinal on Saturday.","NEW: Top two seeds Roddick and Verdasco reach final of SAP Open in San Jose .

VBS.TV is Vice's broadband television network. The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Viewer discretion advised. London, England (VBS.TV) -- In previous episodes of The Vice Guide to Travel, we road-tripped through North Korea, shopped for dirty bombs in Bulgaria, and hunted mutant wild boars in Chernobyl. Little did we know that all of our harrowing journeys would leave us only semi-prepared for a recent trip to war-ravaged, godforsaken Liberia. Since 1989, a series of brutal civil wars -- primarily fought by drug-addicted, prepubescent orphans -- has rendered Liberia one of the most dangerous countries in the world. Everyone has heard the stories of abject poverty, ubiquitous substance abuse and wanton violence taking place there, but we don't really believe anything that we don't see for ourselves. So, stomachs firmly knotted, off we went. We arrived in Liberia with a small crew of three and quickly rendezvoused with a local journalist who would be our fixer and guide. Our first shooting location was the West Point slum, home to 80,000 people living in conditions that redefine squalor. Miles of rotting garbage surround the slum, which has no sewage system. Pretty much everyone -- even the local government officials -- defecates and urinates in the open. Drugs, prostitution and armed robbery are the main industries. We got to know some of the residents of West Point, who told us their stories as they smoked heroin and cocaine and begged us for money. Next we visited a local brothel. The women who lived there talked with us about the U.N. soldiers who have sex with the child prostitutes and beat the older women, and then leave without paying. Watch episode 2 from the Vice Guide to Liberia on VBS.TV . But perhaps the most revelatory portions of our trip to Liberia came from meeting the major warlords of the nation's civil wars. There's a tradition in Liberian militias of taking on extravagant noms de guerre. Hence, our subjects were named General Bin Laden, General Rambo and General Butt Naked. The latter, in particular, was one of the most notorious Liberian warlords. He claims to have personally killed 20,000 people including babies, and to have sometimes cannibalized his victims. Today, General Butt Naked goes by his birth name, which is Joshua. During our time together, he told us that Liberia will surely implode into civil war again when the U.N. leaves next year. But in the meantime, Joshua wants to redeem himself. He offered us a glimpse of the Liberia that he wants to forge, and we found ourselves growing to like him. He took us to his church, where he rehabilitates child soldiers. We watched as he preached his way through Monrovia on a Sunday. Is there a chance that his mission will succeed, and further civil war can be averted in this desperate country? That's one of the many questions that we came away with upon our safe return from Liberia. Watch our documentary about our time there and see what you think.","Crew of three gets firsthand look at poverty, substance abuse in war-ravaged Liberia .

"(CNN) -- Friends and family planned a memorial service in Atlanta, Georgia, on Thursday for Thor Hesla, who died in Monday's attack on a luxury hotel in Afghanistan. Friends describe Thor Hesla as a ""passionate believer"" and ""larger than life."" Hesla, 45, loved a game of ultimate Frisbee, a motorcycle ride and a great adventure. Friends say he found no adventure greater than helping people. He set off for another adventure in October, this time to Afghanistan  to work with the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, to help build civil society. ""Thor Hesla was a passionate believer in what is possible in the world ,"" said a statement posted online by Jennifer Laszlo Mizrahi, a friend of 20 years. The Taliban said it was behind the attack that killed him, carried out by suicide bombers and gunmen. Six other people were killed at Kabul's Serena hotel that day. Six days after Hesla arrived in Afghanistan, he had e-mailed details of his new surroundings to his far-away friends. Despite the violence wracking the nation, Hesla described Kabul as a city with potential and ""astonishing beauty."" He said he was struck by glimpses of ""desperately poor"" Afghans. ""I saw a man moving down the street who was, literally, wearing only rags yesterday,"" Hesla wrote. He expressed pride in his work and the American effort to rebuild Afghanistan, writing, ""You are forcibly reminded how good and inspirational Americans can be."" Life in Kabul isn't easy. Diplomats and contractors in Afghanistan are under strict security and their travel is severely restricted. A witness to Monday's attack said terrorists forced their way into the hotel gym and shot three or four people who were working out.  Watch witness describe the attack » . Hesla's friends said he joined the hotel's gym and spa as a diversion from his limited daily routine. ""You're always, always, always, reminded how great a blessing it is to come from a land which has never known -- since 1865 -- serious war,"" Hesla wrote his friends, referring to the Civil War. ""It's really difficult to calculate how damaging all-out war can be on a society."" ""He was very passionate about everything,"" said friend Stefan Tigges, according to CNN affiliate WGCL. ""He was very generous. He was very spirited, very kind."" Tigges told the Atlanta TV station his friend was ""larger than life in every way in terms of his sense of humor, his intellect, his capacity to love, all these things."" At Atlanta's Emory University, Hesla studied English literature and played rugby. He also worked for the Atlanta Olympic Committee and various Democratic political campaigns, including the 2000 campaign for Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley. In countries such as Trinidad and Tobago; Venezuela, St. Vincent and the Grenadines; Antigua, Barbados and Aruba, Hesla tried to build bridges between feuding groups, and worked on political campaigns seeking to fight crime and corruption, create jobs and improve education, his friends said. For more than three years, Hesla had worked in war-ravaged Kosovo, where he helped reform economic systems. After taking time off to travel and write both a screenplay and a novel, he had set off for Afghanistan to work as a contractor for USAID in its ""capacity building"" program, helping government institutions, social organizations and universities with financial matters. ""We mourn the loss of our fellow employee, Thor Hesla, "" said Elizabeth Palmer of BearingPoint, Hesla's employer. ""He was a loving son and brother and an important part of our BearingPoint family. His commitment to helping the people of Afghanistan was well known, and we will miss him terribly."" Following Thursday's services in Georgia, another is planned for Hesla in Washington D.C., which friends said was his ""adopted home."" E-mail to a friend .

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- Nearly 150,000 homes were without drinking water Monday after the worst floodwaters in 60 years swamped large areas of western England. Flooding has caused widespread disruption across the country with further regions braced for more floods. British military and rescue workers battled to save a major electricity substation on the outskirts of Gloucester, England, that serves about 500,000 homes. About 1,000 Royal Navy personnel were building an emergency barrier to keep the Walham substation from flooding. Their efforts have been successful so far, the Gloucestershire Constabulary Emergency Services said Monday evening. Some 50,000 homes were already without electricity before the substation was threatened. Two major rivers -- the Thames and the Severn -- are well above their normal levels and may burst their banks, according to authorities.  Watch as Britons brace for more flooding » . Britain's Environment Agency warned water levels could rise further to a ""critical level"" and issued nine severe flood warnings across the country. The worst affected areas are the counties of Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Oxfordshire, which had more than 5 inches (12.5 cm) of rain in barely 24 hours. More rain is forecast, and the risk of flooding is increasing as floodwaters work their way into the river system. In the historic city of Gloucester, the River Severn is expected to burst its banks later Monday. The river is already nearly 15 feet (5 meters) above its normal level for this time of year and close to breaching its banks.  See residents walk through flooded streets and homes » . Electricity and water supplies in and around the city are already cut to many residents, after a water treatment plant and electricity sub-station were flooded. The city of Tewkesbury is also flooded -- video from the area showed dozens of cars and homes under several feet of water. Officials said it would be at least 48 hours before they could gain access to the Mythe Water Pumping Station in Tewkesbury to return water supply to 70,000 customers in Tewkesbury, Gloucester and Cheltenham. ""There is no doubt this unprecedented situation has been testing for each and every one of the emergency services and our partner agencies,"" said Gloucestershire Chief Constable Timothy Brain. ""I must pay tribute to the marathon effort being made to prevent the situation from worsening and to support those affected by the flooding, loss of power, loss of water and other consequences of this extreme situation,"" he said. Hundreds of people in the worst affected areas have been plucked to safety by helicopters of the Royal Air Force and boats. Further north in Evesham, the River Severn is more than twice its normal width. So far this month England has had nearly two-and-a-half-times its normal rainfall. Prime Minister Gordon Brown visited Gloucester -- and promised to mobilize resources from across the country. He also announced increased funding for flood and coastal defenses across the country. ""Like every advanced industrialized country, we are coming to terms with the issues surrounding climate change,"" he said. The prime minister described the flooding as unprecedented, and brushed aside criticism of his government for the quality of flood defenses and a slow response to the crisis. ""I think the emergency services have done a great job,"" he said. ""I am satisfied people are doing everything they can."" The wet weather for much of June and July across England and Wales has also affected crops. Farmers are predicting low yields and higher prices -- with several crops due to be harvested in the next month. Insurance companies are expecting claims worth hundreds of millions of dollars because of flood damage. More than 2,000 people spent Sunday night in emergency accommodation and the Royal Air Force and coastguard helicopters airlifted hundreds to safety in one of Britain's largest peacetime rescue operations. ""I'm afraid to say that I don't think we have seen the peak yet,"" John Harman, of the Environment Agency, told BBC radio. ""All this water that we have seen ... is now into the river system. Even though the rain has eased off a bit ... it's the water in the rivers now that constitutes a threat."" E-mail to a friend .","Flood waters in parts of England at 60-year highs .

"London, England (CNN) -- ""I had to be stitched into those pants,"" Olivia Newton-John recalls of the skin-tight black trousers she worn in the film ""Grease"". That fact will come as no surprise to the millions of people who have watched the iconic scene at the end of the smash hit film musical. ""But they were quite comfortable,"" she assured CNN's Max Foster, ""despite what they looked like."" But those trousers, ""made of some sort of shark skin material"" she says, plus a string of memorable songs from the film including ""Summer Nights"" and ""You're The One That I Want"" helped propel Olivia Newton-John to superstardom which has continued to this day. The British-born actress, who was raised in Australia from the age of five, was already an established singing star -- having won three Grammy Awards -- prior to being cast as Sandy Olssen alongside John Travolta's Danny Zuko in the 1978 film. And many of the songs from that era still rank among her favorites in a recording career which has produced over 30 albums including the 1981 double platinum selling ""Physical"" -- which spawned the single of the same name and a craze for spandex and leg warmers. ""The songs I did with John Farrar [the Australian producer and songwriter] are among my favorites. And a lot of those songs, 'Magic' and 'Suspended in Time' are on 'Xanadu,'"" [the soundtrack from the 1980 film]. Of her more recent recordings she cites 2006's ""Grace and Gratitude"" as another favorite. ""It was a healing CD that was very personal for me,"" she said. After the runaway success of the early 1980s Newton-John was preparing for a comeback in 1992 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. The diagnosis changed the course of her life forever. After successfully beating the disease, Newton-John talked openly about her experience and became a passionate advocate for early detection and helping other women cope with the disease. ""I'm so grateful to be here, 17 years after being diagnosed,"" she told CNN. ""I want to empower other women to be really observant of their breast health and do regular breast self-examination."" She also has a Website -- http://www.liv.com// -- which provides information on breast self-examination. ""When I talk to women in my age bracket, they're afraid. I understand the fear but if there is something wrong, the earlier you find it, the better chance you have of a healthy outcome,"" she said. Cancer awareness isn't the only cause she lends her name to. Along with her second husband John Easterling, who she married in 2008, Newton-John helps promote education about rainforests. ""We're helping educate the children of the Amazon to realize the importance of the living rainforest so that when the timber and oil companies come in they know to save it."" Three decades on from her life-changing appearance in ""Grease"", Newton-John is still finding plenty things in her life to become hopelessly devoted to.","Singer and actress Olivia Newton-John speaks to CNN's Connect the World .

"London, England (CNN) -- Europeans faced fresh winter misery Friday as plunging temperatures threw transport networks -- including the Channel Tunnel train service -- into chaos and dwindling cold weather resources raised concerns in a snow-blanketed Britain and other countries. Eurostar, which operates trains between Britain and France, announced it was canceling up to 50 percent of services Friday as bad weather caused a repeat of problems that led to major disruptions and long lines of frustrated and angry travelers last month. With satellite images showing the UK covered in snow from top to toe -- a rare modern event in a country that has experienced two decades of relatively mild winters -- authorities lacking snow plows and salt supplies were struggling to clear roads. Britain's weather forecasting Met Office is warning of continued icy conditions, drifting snow, severe frosts and dangerous wind chill factors across the country over the coming weekend, blaming the recent cold snap on freezing northerly blasts from the Arctic. It said icy conditions were expected to continue for the next two weeks. Forecasters were warning of similar conditions in France, Germany, Switzerland, Poland, the Czech Republic and parts of Italy in the days ahead. As temperatures plummeted to 30-year-lows of -22.3 Celsius (-8.1 Fahrenheit) in some parts of the UK, gas suppliers were reassuring users that there was no immediate likelihood that interruptions to fuel imposed on some businesses could spread to households. The National Grid, which handles supplies of natural gas across Britain, reported that is was expecting to cope with all-time record demand levels Friday after similar peaks a day earlier that called on 454 million cubic meters of gas. Despite the high demand -- and technical problems affecting gas flow from Norway -- National Grid spokeswoman Stephanie van Rosse said there was no danger of an interruption to supply. ""We've got plenty coming in,"" she told CNN. ""It's just a matter of balancing it."" One of the companies whose gas was switched off was British Sugar, based in Peterborough, 130 kilometers (80 miles) north of London. A spokesman there told CNN they had simply switched to using oil until the gas comes back on. ""It doesn't affect our production, so it's just business as usual,"" said the spokesman, who asked not to be named. ""It's a bit of a non-story, really. We just switch and it's no big problem."" Main airports, including Heathrow, Gatwick and Luton, were continuing to advise passengers to contact airlines before setting out as weather added to disruptions already caused by increased security in the wake of last month's failed U.S. plane bombing. Cold weather, blamed for 22 deaths countrywide, also shut schools across Britain and led to warnings of hazardous roads as grit and salt supplies wore thin, prompting local authorities to impose rationing. Environment Secretary Hilary Benn said Britain's only two suppliers of salt were operating at capacity as authorities' standard emergency provisions for six days of snowy weather ran dry. ""The two salt producers are working flat-out, 24 hours-a-day, and we have ordered more salt supplies from abroad,"" he told the BBC. ""But... we will face some difficult decisions about where we are going to prioritize gritting of roads in this exceptionally severe and prolonged cold weather.""

"UNITED NATIONS (CNN) -- Rapes targeting girls as young as seven are on the increase in Afghanistan where conditions for women are little better than under the Taliban, the U.N. and rights groups say. Conditions for women are little better than they were under the hardline Taliban regime, the U.N. says. In its annual report on human rights, the U.N. warned conditions were deteriorating in the war-ravaged country despite U.S.-led efforts after the 2001 removal from power of the hardline militia. ""Violence is tolerated or condoned within the family and community, within traditional and religious leadership circles, as well as the formal and informal justice system,"" said Navi Pillay, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights. The ""Afghan government has failed to adequately protect the rights of women despite constitutional guarantees."" With a resurgent Taliban targeting NATO forces, government security forces and civilians, violence has been on the increase in Afghanistan.. The number of civilian casualties in 2008 totaled 2,118 -- the highest number recorded since the ouster of the Taliban in 2001, the U.N. said, urging greater protecting for ordinary Afghans. Violence against women comes in the form of rape, ""honor killings,"" early and forced marriages, sexual abuse and slavery, the report says. ""The security is the big issue,"" said Suraya Pakzad, founder of the Voice of Women Organization, which promotes education and awareness of women's rights and protects women and girls at risk in Afghanistan. ""Because of security we, unfortunately, day by day, we have to pull out of areas where last year we operated, we have our operations. We were able to work with the women, but this year we cannot,"" she said. ""We have to leave the area because security is getting worse day by day."" ""Rapes in the country have been growing tremendously, particularly child rapes within the ages of 9, 8, 7, even lesser than that,"" said Wazhma Frogh, director of Global Rights Afghanistan. ""So these are the issues that are all born by this lack of security where women have no place in ... security decisions."" Domestic violence against child brides is widespread, said Suraya Pakzad, the founder of the Voice of Women organization, who was married at age 14 and has six children. She said girls as young as 10 face ""violation"" by husbands 40 years their senior. ""By the end ... women, or girls, run away."" But women without husbands, especially widows, may have it even worse in Afghanistan, the report says. Without a spouse, the women are reduced to begging to feed their children. Options outside the home are limited where the Taliban holds sway in Afghanistan. The Taliban's interpretation of strict Islamic law, or sharia, has included banning girls from school and the workplace. Even in areas not overrun by the Taliban, women face risks outside the home. ""The assassination of the most prominent national female senior police officer, in Kandahar in September 2008, underscores the tremendous risks faced by women in public life,"" the report says.","Afghan women's rights are little better than under Taliban, report says .

"West Vancouver, British Columbia (CNN) -- It's more than two hours before snowboard practice begins, two hours before Robert Beck will take his first picture, and he is trudging up the steep icy slope that is one lip of the halfpipe. Temperatures are just above freezing on Cypress Mountain, and Beck, a Sports Illustrated photographer for 24 years, is steadily ambling up the hill to stake out his position near the top. The climb is just 160 meters, but try doing it with a 50- or 60-pound pack on your back and a bad knee repaired just three weeks ago. It's going to be worth it; Beck knows precisely where he needs to be to get the perfect picture when the overwhelming gold medal favorite Shaun White performs. For the next nine hours Beck won't leave his spot -- he's not allowed to come back down until the competition is over -- so he has a bag full of equipment and provisions. He carries three camera bodies, four lenses, several radios to remotely trigger cameras and a bunch of Cliff bars. (McDonald's might sponsor these Games, but there's no Golden Arches on the hill). See 19 of Robert Beck's amazing SI photos from the Winter Games . He knows where to be to get the shot he wants because Beck and his assistant, Kohjiro ""Kojo"" Kinno have been photographing White for months, learning his every move and tendency. For instance, Beck knows the best time to shoot a close-up of White is during his first practice run because the snowboarder doesn't go as high then. They went to three World Cup events and the X Games, shooting White and his competitors in preparation for the Olympics. Then once in Vancouver it was off to every practice to test out different angles to shoot. ""We're trying to frame it just right,"" Beck said on the drive from his hotel to the venue. ""On their tricks, snowboarders are spinning so fast. Sometimes you never see their faces. You don't want to get pictures of rear ends or the bottom of the board. We want to get their faces if we can."" Beck, who has more than 50 Sports Illustrated covers to his credit, is frustrated even before he climbs the hill. Kinno is an important part of the ""we"" he talks about. Kinno has been there for him for nearly seven years, handing him the right equipment, fixing things when they go wonky, running cards back to the work area and often being the voice of reason. But that won't happen today because officials wouldn't give Kinno a photographer's armband. He's not even allowed to shoot pictures from a lower area of the venue. It's almost like a pitcher without his catcher, though the understated Kinno often is the one who shakes Beck off. And then there's the eye roll. They have this way of disagreeing that only longtime friends can have. There's often disagreement, Kinno says, but they always come to an understanding. On this Wednesday at the halfpipe, Kinno will have to stay in front of a laptop all day, trying patiently to wait for runners to bring him the cards from the cameras. At least he has company. John Birk, photographer Al Tielemans' assistant, can't go with his photographer either. Tielemans will spot up on the other side of the pipe while photographer Bob Martin will be positioned at the bottom. Just before setting off for the hill, Beck gets a call from Steve Fine, SI's director of photography. Fine has a request for Beck to get White at a certain angle. Beck's sure he can't and tells Fine that he has a great shot in mind, looking up the pipe as White soars into action. Fine likes that but wants to have one with the crowd in the background. Beck and Kinno agree; it's not a clean shot from where Beck will be, but they can try and see what Fine says. You'd think that Beck can call the shots, so to speak, and send in his favorites from the 1,400 images he will take this day, but that's not the way it works. He lets the photo editors pick the ones they want. ""I don't suggest anything to those guys,"" Beck said. ""I can't control it. I make the best pictures I can, send them, in and it's out of my hands.' He seems cool with that. He's much more concerned with getting a shot that is different from other photogs. It's difficult -- well, almost impossible really -- to be inventive with this assignment, though. There are going to be several other photographers in the same area, and dozens all over the pipe. He'll try to nail it the best he can by using a different lens than others near him (maybe a 35 mm while lying down in the snow) and also through the use of a camera on a 12-foot stick he'll hold up. There's one big issue, though, with White. Beck says when he has used a remote-fired camera, he's able to get other snowboarders in the frame perfectly, but White soars so high that much of the time he's at the top of the frame, if he's even in the picture. Beck's assignment is not solely White; it's just that the 23-year-old budding legend is such a prohibitive favorite it makes sense to Beck that's his main target. He's shooting for the magazine, but he also hopes the Web site can use his photos. In fact, the Web is much more of a sure thing this time. Sports Illustrated's deadlines aren't until the weekend, and the magazine won't arrive at subscribers' homes until a week after the event, so Beck figures it's unlikely this gig has cover potential. And with Lindsey Vonn such a compelling story, too, he's not sure that he'll even get one image in the magazine. Celebration photos always play well, but only the photographers at the bottom will have White right in front of them. Beck halfway wishes he could shoot those photos instead of Martin. ""We're all basically competitive,"" he says wistfully. ""But you can't be both places."" SI.com: Photos of White's winning run . White did the expected and easily won gold. Back in the work area, Beck says not everything went well. Counting practice, each rider who made the final made nine runs. Beck says he solved a problem with one of the remote cameras in time to shoot the first practice session, but at some point he accidentally hit the focus. ""Everything looked like Mr. Magoo [took them],"" he said. At least 75 percent of photography is problem solving, he said. (Two-and-half percent of photography is skill, he joked). It's knowing where to set up, knowing your equipment and knowing how to fix that equipment when it breaks. But while you're fixing things, you're missing pictures, and it's frustrating. And then there's just plain bad luck. Beck says that during one practice run a TV cameraman ran in front of him, snapping pictures on his phone. But these are the things you deal with, he says. He's a little down at dinner afterward because he caught a glimpse of the some of the other photographers' pictures. As he had predicted, a bunch of shots with White, his face one big smile, holding the U.S. flag. But later his mood changes when back at the hotel suite he logs onto the SI.com Web site. There is a picture, looking up the pipe of White, cast against a clear night sky, soaring through the air, on his way to a gold medal. As for the magazine, he'll be waiting, just like the rest of us .","Robert Beck has been a photographer with Sports Illustrated for 24 years .

"(CNN) -- In 1909, Alice Ramsey blazed a path across America's landscape and society. Millions of women have followed in her tracks, few more precisely than Emily Anderson exactly 100 years later. Anderson was the lead driver in a re-enactment last summer of Ramsey's journey, when she became the first woman to drive an automobile from coast to coast. Both women drove a 1909 Maxwell DA from New York to San Francisco, California, but they traversed two very different Americas. ""It really was a tremendous effort by so many people to get us across the country,"" Anderson, an event planner from Seattle, Washington, said. ""It showed me the heart of America was open to us in a big way that I don't think would normally be so open had we been in a modern-day vehicle."" Antique car enthusiast Richard Anderson recruited his 34-year-old daughter to drive the 1909 Maxwell DA he and two friends built from parts they scavenged from around the globe, and hand-fabricated when necessary. ""It all came down to a lot of books and manuals and guessing and putting a puzzle back together again with no instructions,"" Emily Anderson said. They got the car built and running in time to launch the drive on June 9 at 1930 Broadway, the address where Ramsey's journey began. Several of Ramsey's descendants were on hand, including two who rode along for a few miles. Anderson's Maxwell soon suffered the first of many breakdowns. ""That was a bit defeating, especially since it was our first day and we were pretty jazzed and motivated to get moving and get on the road,"" she said. Temporary repairs carried the car and crew about 1,800 miles to western Nebraska, where a master mechanic worked for more than five hours to fix the problem in a more permanent way. ""It was amazing to me that people would just stop their lives and do whatever they could to keep us moving,"" Anderson said. By Anderson's side was Christie Catania, her close friend and co-pilot. Catania described the co-pilot's job as ""navigation, waving, talking to people in the back seat; I was also the blinker, the mirrors, comic relief ..."" Librarian-storyteller Sally Barnett rode in the back seat most of the way. ""I love old cars, and I had read about Alice Ramsey years ago. She's one of my heroine-mentors,"" said Barnett, 67, of Huntsville, Alabama. ""... My part was to dress up as Alice and tell her story."" The Maxwell's fourth seat was reserved for sponsors, dignitaries and special guests along the way, Anderson said. When she wasn't in the rear of the Maxwell, Barnett was riding in the back seat of other antique cars that fell into formation along the way, forming what enthusiast Leta Nichols of Orangevale, California, called ""a 3,000-mile parade."" High-speed collisions with flying insects were a hallmark of the trip. ""You don't realize how valuable a windshield is until you ride in a car without a windshield, Barnett quipped. ""We were really acting as human windshields and bug-catchers,"" Anderson recalled. ""A couple times a day we had a teeth-cleaning."" But at least the 2009 group had well-mapped, paved roads to travel on, part of the reason they were able to cross the country in 30 days, half the time it took Ramsey, who followed the general path of what would become the Lincoln Highway. ""We traveled at a faster rate simply because we could,"" Anderson said. ""Alice only had 152 miles of paved roadway in 1909, and those roads were primarily within the cities. ... Otherwise it was all wagon trails, and that's some difficult terrain to cross."" The social terrain was equally difficult. Ramsey ""fit a category of woman in the early-20th century, late-19th century who was interested in quietly demonstrating that women were as capable as men in many of the things that had been considered manly pursuits,"" said Drake Hokanson, author of the book ""Lincoln Highway: Main Street Across America."" The first cross-country drive by a man, Horatio Nelson Jackson, had been accomplished just six years before Ramsey set out. ""I can only imagine that the world said, 'Here's a woman with some gall. She can do this; why can't other women?'"" Hokanson said. ""And, of course, a lot of women did hit the road."" Ramsey overcame sexism, but she didn't have to contend with huge tractor-trailers passing at 70 mph, kicking up debris and creating a gale-force draft around the open car. ""I learned to turn my head when trucks go by so the sand wouldn't hit you too hard,"" Barnett recalled. Anderson's Maxwell drove the final thousand miles with no first gear, which made crossing mountain ranges challenging. ""Hopefully you have a long downhill before the uphill so you can kind of take a big run at it,"" she said. ""And that's what we would do, just kind of gun it and try to go as fast as we could up the hill."" The expedition's triumphal moment was the crossing of the Golden Gate Bridge into San Francisco -- something Ramsey couldn't have done in 1909 because the bridge wouldn't be built for another 28 years. ""The toll booth operator came out with her iPhone to take our picture,"" Barnett said. The entire journey was filmed by Emily Anderson's brother Bengt Anderson, a professional filmmaker in New York. A documentary is slated for release in 2010. The tour ended with champagne at a picturesque park. ""I would just encourage everyone to slow down and take some of the back roads and enjoy the Lincoln Highway and all these different highways I didn't know existed until I was fortunate enough to be a part of this drive,"" Catania said. ""Embrace the pace. Half of the fun is the journey.""","Emily Anderson recreates Alice Ramsey's 1909 coast-to-coast auto odyssey .

Sarah Thacker, a Minnesota woman who was in Haiti to bring home her newly adopted son, now finds herself facing allegations that the paperwork she held was forged. Thacker and two other women who helped her were not arrested, but are the subject of the incident that follows the arrests of 10 U.S. missionaries accused of taking a group of Haitian children out of the country without the proper paperwork. All 10 were charged with trying to take 33 children out of Haiti without any legal authorization after a magnitude-7.0 earthquake devastated the country on January 12. Eight of them have been released on bail and have returned to the United States. Thacker and the two other women were going to escort six Haitian orphans to the United States to new families, including Thacker's adopted son, Reese. ""I can understand paranoia and absolutely, and I understand there was a story about people illegally taking children out of the country, but fear doesn't justify these actions,"" Stephanie Anderson, a volunteer who was helping Thacker, told CNN. On Saturday, the three women were outside the Port-au-Prince airport waiting in line to transport the children in a private plane when, Anderson says, they were surrounded by an angry mob of men demanding to see their paperwork. ""They started screaming at us that they are Haitian children, and who do we think we are taking their kids from their country, and these missionaries can't be stealing kids, and they started swearing and yelling at us,"" Anderson, who is not a missionary, said. The police were called in and the women were detained for eight hours, they told CNN. Full coverage of the earthquake's aftermath . The key document -- a permission signed by Haiti's prime minister -- was suspected as a fake by police, something the women and U.S. officials deny. There is no chance the paperwork is fake, Thacker said. A representative from the U.S. Embassy was with them during their ordeal and, in the end, police did not arrest the women but decided that the children would at least be temporarily placed in government custody. ""I was scared. It was my job to protect those children and I didn't feel I could protect them when I was being harassed,"" said Maria O'Donovan, who lives in Haiti and works at the orphanage where Reese and the other five children lived. CNN made attempts to reach the Haitian prime minister without success. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar is backing Thacker's efforts. ""They have filled out all the paperwork. This is a legitimate orphanage that has brought other children to America. And I feel like these little babies are just caught up in this international dispute, and it's just not fair,"" she said. CNN's Ismael Estrada contributed to this report.","Police suspected key document -- permission signed by Haiti's PM -- was fake .

"Vancouver, British Columbia (CNN)  -- The headline on the front page of The Province newspaper says it all Monday: ""Lost Weekend."" For Canadians, who came into the Winter Olympics full of pride, the weekend was one that they want to forget but cannot. The biggest loss came Sunday evening when Canada's hockey team, full of NHL all-stars, lost to the United States, a team known for its youth and Olympics inexperience. ""O No Canada,"" read the headline in The Vancouver Sun. On the sports page, the newspaper said, ""Woe Canada, U.S. sticks stake in our hearts."" The streets of Vancouver, a frenzy of activity on Friday and Saturday night, were far less crowded after the game ended about 7 p.m. local time Sunday. Where many sidewalks were so crowded the previous two days that pedestrians were forced to walk in the road, tying up traffic in the downtown core, cars traveled easily Sunday. It was a stark contrast to the prior Sunday, when fans spontaneously sang ""O Canada"" late into the night when many of them knew they had to work the next day and should be at home. ""Last week, you could really feel it on the streets,"" said Steve Milton, a writer for the Hamilton Spectator and the author of 15 books on winter sports. ""There was a real testosterone level in the air, and [Sunday] night, it was toxic."" After the game, one Canadian hockey player downplayed the pressure his team might feel. ""You're not trying to take 30 million people and put them on your shoulders,"" Corey Perry told the Montreal Gazette. Still, most observers feel that if Canada doesn't medal in men's hockey, its national winter sport, the Olympics will be a disaster. The country has mixed emotions after the loss to the U.S., Milton said. In one sense, it doesn't look like men's hockey team will be the cavalry riding in over the hill at the last minute to save the Olympics. But this was a preliminary round loss, and people have some hope this team can right itself in the next round. They sense -- and demand -- a big change to the lineup. Milton's e-mail inbox is filling at a much higher rate than normal, he said. It's all about the hockey team, and everyone is playing coach. Most say it's time to change goalies, taking out veteran Martin Brodeur and putting in Roberto Luongo for Tuesday's play-in game against Germany. ""It blunts our unhappiness when we have someone to blame,"" Milton said. ""It almost makes us feel better to blame it on Brodeur."" The somber mood was made worse by the news that the 55-year-old mother of Canada's top figure skater, Joannie Rochette, died in Vancouver just a few days before she was her to see her daughter compete. Rochette is still scheduled to take part in Tuesday's short program. Although much of Canada will be watching the hockey game against Germany, viewers will also tune in to see how Rochette does. Visiting the Games? Send in an iReport . Part of the country's embarrassment is over the Own the Podium program that Canadian officials trumpeted before the Games. The government poured $117 million into it in the past five years. Officials predicted huge success for the host nation, including topping the medal count. But with one week left in the Olympics, the United States has a leading 24 medals, but Canada has only nine. Writers are starting to call it Blown the Podium or Flown the Podium. ""I think we'd be living in a fool's paradise to say we could catch the Americans and win,"" Chris Rudge, CEO of the Canadian Olympic Committee, said Monday morning. ""We're not throwing in the towel. You never do that in a fight."" Canadian officials say not to worry, things are going to improve. ""It was the 'U.S. Week' last week. This week will be ours,"" said Michael Chambers, president of the Canadian Olympic Committee.","Newspaper: ""O No Canada"" after loss hockey loss to U.S.

"New York (CNN) -- The legendary New York restaurant Tavern on the Green will close its doors after serving a last supper and hosting a New Year's party. The iconic spot on the western edge of Central Park will undergo major renovations under a new operator and may even retain its famous name, but to many patrons, this is indisputably the end of an era. Claudia Myers and Wayne Knowles, a semi-retired couple visiting from Norfolk, Virginia, were saddened by the news and decided to treat themselves to one last Tavern dinner. ""I came here years ago and had good memories,"" Knowles said. ""It's the atmosphere and ambience"" Myers added. ""Everyone knows what Tavern on the Green is and where is it"" -- here, Myers paused -- ""except one cab driver. It's just a neat place. It has history and it's in the park."" Ed Brown and his wife, Judy, also were in town for the holidays from Plantation, Florida, and were aware of the restaurant's plans. ""It's my first and last time at eating at Tavern on the Green,"" Brown said. ""At least I can now say I ate there."" Rodney Shephard recently was making preparations for his last party, for 1,500 guests. It's nothing the restaurant's maitre d' for the past 23 years couldn't handle, but he wasn't looking forward to his last party on his last day of employment at the restaurant. ""I never thought this day would come"" said Shephard, 52. ""Not like this. Not like the money-making machine that this place is."" The restaurant served its first meal in 1936, when Mayor Fiorello La Guardia presided over its opening as the city and the country were trying to dig out from the Great Depression. The restaurant almost died in 1974 when the operator  shuttered the ""rustic little money-losing pub,"" as New York Times food writer Eric Asimov later described it. But Warner LeRoy immediately took over the Tavern's lease and invested $10 million. He added two rooms to the existing four and installed scores of copper and brass chandeliers, Tiffany-style stained glass, bull's-eye glass mirrors and ornate pastel-colored fixtures, and a 167-foot mural depicting Central Park. After its 1976 reopening, words like ""playful,"" ""dazzling"" and ""eclectic"" were used to describe the restaurant's ambience and the menu. ""It was an over-the-top whimsical place,"" said longtime publicist Shelley Clark. Warner Leroy's father, Mervyn LeRoy, was the producer of the ""Wizard of Oz,"" A black-and-white photograph hanging in the Tavern shows Warner as a child with Judy Garland on the set of the movie. Jennifer Oz LeRoy, in her recently published book ""Tavern on the Green 125 Recipes for Good Times,"" -- co-authored by her mother, Kay -- described the vision of the restaurant that her father wanted. ""When he walked into the courtyard of the run-down building, he imagined something wholly original and incredible: He would build a room in that space that would look like the inside of a wedding cake."" she recalled. ""He was a brilliant showman and a brilliant restaurateur. He was bigger than life."" said the Tavern's chief operating officer, Michael Desiderio. ""He thought dining is like a great show, and when the curtain goes up everything must be perfect."" Shephard, who started as a front desk manager, fondly recalled LeRoy and the sense of family that he brought to the establishment: ""It's like a second home. I consider the employees like your brothers and sisters, and now it's all going to be cut off."" The restaurant became the destination for anniversaries, birthdays and family affairs, It served more than 500,000 people a year, an average of 1,400 dinners a night. Tourists eagerly descended upon the eatery for the crab cakes, wedge salad, salmon and parmesan-crusted chicken. Food critics were not so thrilled. Andrew Knowlton, restaurant editor for Bon Appetit magazine, said the restaurant has never been the greatest venue for foodies. ""When you're serving 2,000 meals a deal, I don't care if you're [chef] Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Daniel Boulud, you just can't put out that much of a volume and have top quality food."" The LeRoy family was forced to file for bankruptcy in 2009 after losing a bidding war for to another proprietor, Dean Poll, who also owns the Boathouse Restaurant in Central Park. Once the restaurant closes, its contents will be auctioned off by Guernsey's auction house. As part of the 20-year license to operate the restaurant, Poll is expected to invest $25 million on renovations. While maintaining the Victorian historic features of the building, Poll's plan is to incorporate green building technology as well as replacing the kitchen and electrical and plumbing systems. The renovations, which are expected to take four years, will be conducted in phases so the restaurant can remain open. Attorney Barry LePatner, who represents Poll, said the new revitalized restaurant will become a popular destination for tourists and New Yorkers alike. ""The new incarnation of Tavern on the Green will integrate modern respect with an iconic location and a sensibility that will warm to New Yorkers"" LePatner said. ""We want more New Yorkers as well as tourists."" LePatner said that while the terms of the lease are still being negotiated with the city parks department and issues with labor unions are still unresolved, Poll's vision is to create a new era. ""The game plan is to have one of the biggest creative moments in the history of the city, and bring Tavern on the Green back to its original, enhanced luster."" One issue that is still left unresolved is the iconic name of the restaurant, which the current management estimates is valued at $19 million. The LeRoy family claims it trademarked the name in 1981. U.S. District Court Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum is expected to make a ruling in January. In the meantime, LePatner said, the city has filed a trademark for ""Tavern in the Park"" but that Poll would like to retain the original name and that it should rest with the site. Warner LeRoy, who was fond of flamboyant bashes, probably would approve of the Tavern's plan to say farewell on New Year's Eve. Over the park, as fireworks light up the sky and as the last party-goers exit, they will gaze at the 750,000 tiny white light bulbs that envelop the restaurant and just hope the new owners remember to keep the lights on.","Legendary NYC restaurant Tavern on the Green to close its doors at end of year .

"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN)  -- The reputed leader of the Zetas drug cartel in the Mexican state of Veracruz was killed in a gunbattle with federal authorities, the Mexican attorney general's office has said. Braulio Arellano Dominguez, also known as ""El Gonzo,"" ""Zeta 20"" or ""El Verdugo,"" was mortally wounded when federal police and sailors went to search a house in the city of Soledad de Doblado, the attorney general said in a release Tuesday. Arellano Dominguez opened fire with a .38-caliber revolver and was wounded in the firefight, officials said. He died while being transported to a hospital. Three other suspects were arrested. Officials said they confiscated five cars, four motorcycles, a submachine gun, a hand grenade, four pistols, more than 150 rounds of ammunition, communication equipment, three bags containing unspecified powder and pills, 74,900 pesos ($5,655) and $107 in U.S. currency. Veracruz is in southeastern Mexico on the Gulf of Mexico coast. Los Zetas, formed by former Mexican elite commando-type soldiers, consists mostly of ex-federal and local police. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration considers the group among the most advanced and violent of Mexico's drug cartels. Originally formed as the Gulf drug cartel's enforcement wing, the Zetas increasingly have branched out on their own. More than 12,000 people have been killed since President Felipe Calderon declared war on the drug cartels after taking office in December 2006. He has deployed thousands of military personnel and federal police in his battle against the drug traffickers.","Reputed leader of Los Zetas cartel in Mexico's Veracruz state reportedly in gunbattle .

"Washington (CNN) -- I was in the building at Fort Hood, Texas, in June where 43 people were shot this week. I was sent to Fort Hood along with CNN Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr and videographer Phil Littleton. During our visit, we were in and out of several buildings. One of them is now a crime scene, a killing ground in the heart of one of America's largest military installations. Col. Ben Danner was our public affairs escort. When I called him Thursday, Danner told me the shooting happened at the Soldier Readiness Center that we had visited during our trip. The purpose of our visit was to learn how Fort Hood was helping soldiers cope with stress and mental health problems. It was a high priority for the commanders there. I grabbed the tape and disks with the video from our trip and cued up the video of the center. It was just as I remembered -- a low, brick building. There was one main entrance. A sergeant/nurse was directing traffic as people constantly moved in and out. Once inside, the space was about the size of a basketball court. And there were lines, lines of soldiers everywhere. The lines to our right were about half a dozen soldiers deep. Those folks were standing. To the left, about 60 or so soldiers were waiting in another line. They got to sit in metal folding chairs. But as the line moved, they moved from chair to chair. I don't think any of them got to sit in the same chair more than 30 seconds. The place looked like the Department of Motor Vehicles at lunchtime on the last Friday of the month. Only everybody was in Army camouflage fatigues. Beyond those lines were cubicles, each one with a least one line leading into it. All these soldiers were getting paperwork stamped or signed. Or they were undergoing routine medical examinations. One area was just for vaccinations. Everyone got poked with a needle at least once. Everything was done out in the open, with only cubicle walls to keep soldiers in one line from seeing what soldiers in the other line were going through. I was able to wander around and watch, while Barbara talked to the top officers and Phil took video of all the goings on. I remember the only place where someone could get privacy was way in the back, a few small offices with walls and a door that could be closed. I was told that's where soldiers would be taken if a routine mental health exam indicated a more thorough one might be needed. What I don't remember was a back door. There may have been one. I probably missed it. But the only door I remember is the one where the sergeant/nurse was directing traffic. And I've been thinking about her as the details of the shootings emerged. The sergeant/nurse was a no-nonsense woman. She'd greet everyone just as they walked in (first making sure they removed their hats). If they had the right paperwork, she sent them to the first of what would be many lines. If they didn't have the right paperwork, she'd turn them around and send them out to get it. And when the soldiers had gone through all the lines, there was to be no loitering by that door. She'd send them on their way. I don't remember her exact rank. But I know she was a nurse; I asked her because she reminded me of my sister who is a nurse and also skilled at ""running the show."" After we were done in June, I went to her and told her that while there were plenty of captains, majors and colonels around, I could tell this was her facility. I was grateful she let us take pictures inside there that day. She gave me a quick smile and went right back to work. As I write this, I worry about that sergeant/nurse. Since I don't remember her name, I may never know if she was there when the horror erupted. If she was working, I'm sure she would have stopped the gunman, asking him why he was there. If he was holding two guns, he may not have been able to remove his cap. She may not have had enough time to say something. I hope she did not become his first victim. Maybe she's safe and sound, at home with her loved ones. But 43 others are not safe and sound. And all over the country, people with friends and family Army are worried about their loved ones. Was he or she in that building, stuck in line when the shooting began?","CNN's Larry Shaughnessy had assignment at Fort Hood in June .

"London, England (CNN) -- A British court has granted Tiger Woods an injunction prohibiting the publication of pictures of him taken or obtained in certain circumstances. The order prevents CNN saying what those circumstances are. The High Court in London issued the injunction Thursday afternoon, said the Schillings law firm, which is representing Woods. ""For the avoidance of doubt, this order is not to be taken as an admission that any such photographs exist,"" Schillings said in a letter sent to legal departments of British publications. ""Our client is not aware of any images and in any event he would not have consented to any such photographs being taken, nor would he have consented to the dissemination or exploitation of the same."" The court document says anyone who violates the order may be held in contempt of court and may be fined, imprisoned or have assets seized. The 33-year-old golfer, who tops the sport's world rankings, has been mired in controversy since he crashed his car outside his Florida mansion last month. The crash prompted authorities to cite him for careless driving and fine him $164. Woods was not required to talk to police about the wreck and declined to speak with investigators on several occasions. In the week after the crash, Woods apologized for ""transgressions"" that let his family down. On the same day, gossip magazine US Weekly published a report alleging that Woods had an affair with a 24-year-old cocktail waitress named Jaimee Grubbs. ""I have let my family down, and I regret those transgressions with all of my heart. I have not been true to my values and the behavior my family deserves,"" he said in a December 3 statement on his official Web site. US Weekly's report followed a National Enquirer article before the crash that the athlete was having an affair with a New York nightclub hostess -- an assertion the hostess vigorously denied, according to The New York Post.","UK court prohibits publication of photos of Tiger Woods taken in certain circumstances .

"(Entertainment Weekly) -- In the movies, ""the suburbs"" are never just a place. They're a state of mind, a mythology we all know in our bones. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio share a happy moment in ""Revolutionary Road."" The myth goes something like this: The suburbs are comfortable, maybe even beautiful, but their serenity is rooted in a friendly American conformity, so that the people who live there have to repress their true selves, which will emerge when they drink too much and have affairs, or rage at each other for their dishonesty, which was all caused in the first place by ... the suburbs. The best thing about ""Revolutionary Road,"" a cool-blooded and disquieting adaptation of Richard Yates' 1961 novel about a powerfully unhappy Connecticut couple, is that it doesn't end with that rote vision of bourgeois anomie. It only begins there. Frank and April Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet) are about 30, with two kids, and both believe they can evade the traps of the existence they've chosen. The year is 1955, and Frank has a New York job that bores him, marketing business machines. He takes solace in feeling superior to his work, and also in his midday martinis and occasional dip into the secretarial pool. April, meanwhile, wanted to be an actress, and still feels she's meant for higher things.  Watch DiCaprio and Winslet talk about their reunion » . Moved to reach for something more, April comes up with a plan: She and Frank will sell their home and move to Paris, where she'll work as a government secretary and he will ... find himself. (It's like a '60s fantasy a decade ahead of time.) ""Revolutionary Road"" was directed by Sam Mendes, who made the glibly scathing ""American Beauty,"" only here he wants us to share not just Frank and April's misery but the frail reveries that hold them together. The escape-to-Paris idea is naive, impractical -- a pipe dream. Yet it's fueled by something Mendes captures about the '50s, an era when people often had deep imaginative sparks that exceeded their ability to voice them. Winslet has the tricky job of making us see the glimmer of wisdom in April's cockeyed plan, and she pulls it off, even as DiCaprio's Frank -- chipper, forthright, wholesome even in betrayal -- tugs the couple back to reality. ""Revolutionary Road"" has deception, adultery, operatic shouting, the then-forbidden specter of abortion, and a few scenes that spotlight the remarkable performance of Michael Shannon as John Givings, a mathematician who's been hospitalized for insanity, and who proves how unfit for society he is by making every acid comment cut to the truths that no one else will speak. The film is lavishly dark -- some might say too dark -- yet I'd suggest it has a different limitation: For all its shattering domestic discord, there's something remote and aestheticized about it. April brings a private well of conflict to her middle-class prison, but Winslet is so meticulous in her telegraphed despair that she intrigues us, moves us, yet never quite touches our unguarded nerves.

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- We had not been in Port-au-Prince in a month, not since those horrible days following the earthquake when the city looked like wreckage. The city seemed so upbeat when we arrived Saturday morning on one of the first flights in since commercial airlines resumed service. Musicians wearing Western Union T-shirts greeted us near the hanger that now passes as baggage claim. Next to our hotel, street vendors peddled souvenirs outside a tent city surrounding the presidential palace. But those optimistic signs were eclipsed Sunday night when a torrent of rain poured down on this wounded city where outdoor tent communities have sprouted up in every empty space. Then, just after 4:30 a.m. Monday, an aftershock of magnitude 4.75 shook and shook and finally gave a last forceful jerk before stopping. You could hear the wails on the street, the confused voices of people arguing over whether to stay outside or risk going back in. This one-two punch of natural forces reverberated through the most vulnerable communities. Full coverage of the aftermath of the earthquake in Haiti . Ariana Manassero, 17, raced into the main room of her home following the tremor. Her parents direct the Maison de Lumiere, but the girls' home is unstable, so Ariana watches over the little ones at her house. They immediately started screaming. ""When is it going to end?"" she asked before spending her day coddling some very traumatized children. Daphne, 4, clung to Ariana, shaking, acting out, sobbing for no good reason. The big quake on January 12 had rattled a cinder block wall in her play yard, crushing her leg, which now has a cherry red cast. The aftershock left her completely undone. All day, staff members of Maison surveyed the damage to their community. A tent city they helped build across from their school had puddles of water sitting in the ""homes."" Women ran up to the staff asking for food, new tarps and clean water for their children. The same scene unfolded in a nearby ravine whose inhabitants had attended a Sunday morning service at Maison. That day, women from the ravine had come escorting children who'd been washed with soap and rain water. Singing and laughing had filled the air. By Monday, the heavy rain had soaked their tents where the ""roofs"" are made of scarves and sheets. The weather had become a great equalizer, reducing the people and the animals to the same conditions. In one alley, a father bundled a newborn with whatever he could find. In another, a dog cuddled her new puppies. Baby goats foraged for food in the garbage. Chicks picked at droppings. No one had eaten fresh food in a week, and the Maison staff brought baby formula and rice. People pushed aside the dogs, the goats and the chicks and neatly lined up. Sad stories floated around the crowd. A woman who had attended the services had died after the aftershock, her heart suddenly seizing. A missionary worried aloud about a newborn wrapped in plastic whose parents had no formula for the baby's first five days. The situation only worsened early Tuesday. For the second time in as many days, an earthquake struck in the overnight hours. The magnitude 4.7 aftershock was centered about 20 miles west-southwest of Port-au-Prince. It hit at 1:26 a.m. Tuesday, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. A second smaller quake shook the area a few minutes later. No immediate reports of damage were made, but the aftershock sent frightened people once again out into the bug-filled night. When is this going to end? It doesn't seem like an answerable question. The rain swells the latrines and unearths the sewage. Aftershocks rattle nerves and rearrange piles of debris. People sleeping outside now feel threatened by the rains, but sleeping inside carries the threat of the seemingly never-ending aftershocks. In the food line, the crowd was so quiet for people who looked hungry and faced a long wait. Not much to say when a step forward is followed by a big leap back.","CNN's Soledad O'Brien and her crew return to Port-au-Prince more than a month after quake .

"Washington (CNN) -- He was talking about health care, but President Obama could have just as easily been summing up his entire first year when he made some blunt comments in a closed-door meeting with House Democrats last week. Democratic sources who were in the room say Obama, pressed by liberals angry about the reform package getting watered down, decided to quote Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who said recently: ""What we're building here is not a mansion, it's a starter home. It's a starter home, but it's got a great foundation for expanding health care coverage to 31 million Americans."" Obama's point was that he believes the health bill -- if it can pass (and that's in real doubt now) -- would be a dramatic step forward but is just the first draft. He hopes to come back later in his presidency to pass a second reform package that finishes the job. The same goes for other big Obama promises like energy reform to deal with climate change and financial regulatory reform to clean up Wall Street -- ""mansions"" that have not been built yet, even though a strong ""foundation"" has been put down to meet these promises in the future. But Republican Scott Brown's stunning victory in Massachusetts on Tuesday suggests Obama may not even get the first draft of health care reform through Congress, because of a huge split in his own party: Angry liberals in the House are signaling they will not rush through what they consider to be the Senate's weak version of reform before Brown gets seated in the Senate, while skittish conservative Democrats in the Senate, like Ben Nelson of Nebraska, may no longer be on board with any kind of reform, out of a fear of becoming the next Martha Coakley. The broader problem Obama has been facing, even before Massachusetts, is that securing a mere ""starter home"" on health care or any other major issue is a far cry from the sky-high expectations he set for his supporters one year ago, when they were shouting ""Yes We Can!"" after a campaign in which he laid out plans for dramatic change. To be fair, the president warned in his inaugural address, one year ago Wednesday, that all of the nation's problems would not be solved so quickly. ""They are serious, and they are many,"" he said then. ""They will not be met easily or in a short span of time."" Nevertheless, most Americans skipped past that section of the speech, and focused instead on Obama's promise to end the bitter partisan divide in Washington on the way to shaking up the system. That goodwill from the early days evaporated quickly, and the president's approval ratings have dipped as disappointment has grown among the very independent voters who helped elect him in 2008. That's why he very deliberately tried to recalibrate expectations at a Washington church this Sunday as he delivered remarks celebrating the birthday of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. ""There was a hope shared by many that life would be better from the moment that I swore that oath,"" Obama said. ""Of course, as we meet here today, one year later, we know the promise of that moment has not yet been fully fulfilled. Because of an era of greed and irresponsibility that sowed the seeds of its own demise, because of persistent economic troubles unaddressed through the generations, because of a banking crisis that brought the financial system to the brink of catastrophe, we are being tested -- in our own lives and as a nation -- as few have been tested before."" Poll: 51 percent approve of Obama after first year . Channeling the outrage that fueled Brown's upset victory in Massachusetts, House Republican Whip Eric Cantor of Virginia said the reason for the disconnect is that the president dropped the talk of unity too quickly and instead ""forged ahead with a narrow ideological agenda that has compromised his ability to create sustainable jobs and thereby fix our nation's most pressing problems."" In an op-ed on the new conservative Web site Daily Caller, Cantor charged his party has offered to work with the president but he has ""paid our proposals mere lip service when the cameras are on, only to rebuff our ideas in their entirety once the meeting ends. As a result, the history books may well look back on the beginning of the Obama presidency as the era of squandered opportunities."" White House press secretary Robert Gibbs insists Republicans have not made serious overtures to meet the president halfway, perhaps hoping instead that Obama's struggles will help the GOP in the November midterm elections. And Gibbs says the real reason for Obama's problems stems from the fact that he made some tough decisions on unpopular -- but necessary -- government interventions to save the economy. ""Ensuring that the banks didn't collapse was not a popular decision,"" Gibbs said. ""The president strongly believes it was the right one. Ensuring that two domestic auto companies didn't go out of business -- not popular. Again, the president believed it was the right decision to make."" Obama also frequently reminds the public that in addition to inheriting that financial crisis, he was also handed two unpopular wars, in Iraq and Afghanistan, and a continuing threat from al Qaeda, that have tested his mettle as commander in chief. All of that has weighed on Obama's approval rating, especially the difficult decision to send more than 50,000 additional U.S. troops to escalate the war in Afghanistan. The terror incident on Christmas Day was a fresh reminder that national security is a wild card for any president. As each day in office passes, it will become harder and harder for Obama to continue pointing the finger of blame at former President George W. Bush for all of the ""inherited"" problems. And in a strange way, Tuesday's election loss could help Obama refocus his agenda at the start of year two. A top Democratic strategist close to the White House said that it's a lot better for the White House to take its lumps now and readjust priorities in the weeks ahead to avoid much larger losses in the midterm election -- rather than coasting along now and then getting hit with an awful surprise in November. But will Obama and his top aides dig in and refuse to move to the middle a bit? Or will they acknowledge that Massachusetts is a wake-up call, as Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh and other moderate Democrats have suggested, and make some adjustments? Then-President Clinton was briefly humiliated by the 1994 midterm election debacle caused in large part by his overreaching health care effort, but he quickly picked himself up off the canvas and started focusing on bite-sized initiatives that won Republican support and positioned him for an easy re-election victory in 1996. Ron Pollack, head of the liberal health group Families USA, is pushing Obama to finish off health reform quickly before Democrats lose their 60-vote supermajority in the Senate. But Pollack also said he thinks on some of the other big issues after health reform, like climate change and Wall Street regulatory reform, ""they will have to get some Republican"" lawmakers on board, and the new political reality may force some compromise on both sides. But Pollack added that it's ""way premature"" to suggest the Massachusetts race will bring a major shift to the political climate. He's still confident that as the unemployment picture improves down the road, ""people will see the good in Obama's policies"" on health and other matters, and his standing will improve. Of course, there's also the possibility the public mood continues to sour on the economy and Obama's other key initiatives like health care. Brown seemed to be warning in his victory speech Tuesday night that the anti-incumbent anger Obama rode into office could wind up blowing up in his face in November. ""What happened here in Massachusetts can happen all over America,"" Brown said to cheers. In fact, when Brown talked about scrapping the health reform effort and starting over because ""we can do better,"" the Republican crowd started a chant that had to send a tiny shiver down the spine of even the most confident White House staffer. ""Yes we can!"" Brown's supporters shouted. ""Yes we can!""","Obama stresses building foundation for future steps toward his agenda .

"(CNN) -- An American missionary family living in Haiti has been providing virtually nonstop reports about the devastation from Tuesday's earthquake and tracking down information on others serving there. ""There is no way to even begin to share the things we've heard and seen since 5 p.m. yesterday,"" Tara Livesay wrote on the family's blog Wednesday morning. ""To do so would take hours that we don't have to give right now. Some of them feel wrong to tell. Like only God should know these personal horrible tragedies."" Tara and Troy Livesay are country directors for World Wide Village, a Minnesota-based charitable organization providing Christian education, health care, nutrition and micro-enterprise opportunities to children and families in Haiti. ""Sometimes life in Haiti leaves you wondering 'Where are you God?' and other times we witness miracles with our own eyes,"" they write in their blog profile. Besides Troy and Tara, the household in Port-au-Prince is made up of daughter Paige, 15, and ""the crew"": Isaac, 8, Hope, 7, Noah, 5, Phoebe Joy, 3, Lydia Beth, 2, Annie, also 2, and Peanut the dog. Some of the children are adopted. Daughter Britt, 19, lives in Texas with her husband, Chris. In addition, there's Jeronne, the children's nanny. (""She is the MVP around here. We love her and think of her as family,"" the blog says.) Finally, there's Tipap, Troy's assistant, security chief and all-around handyman, who lives at the World Wide Village Guest House. The Livesays see themselves and their efforts as ""a work in progress -- trying to make the love of Jesus known while learning to know Him better ourselves."" That work since Tuesday evening has been consumed by gathering and reporting information about the quake and accounting for missing missionaries and other people. Troy Livesay's reports came in the form of tweets that alternated between raw descriptions and expressions of hope: . ""... covered in dust and debris ... we saw a few bodies that had been pulled out of the rubble laying dead in the sidewalk ... many others injured"" ""Church groups are singing throughout the city all through the night in prayer. It is a beautiful sound in the middle of a horrible tragedy."" ""The worst damage is in Carrfour (South of Port, near the Palace) we are hearing that many two and three story buildings did not make it."" ""Tipap made it home from Carrefour - saw many dead bodies and injured along the way - said most buildings w/more than one story are down."" ""The Haitian people are out praying together -- aftershock happening right now."" Share your images and accounts . On the blog, Tara Livesay's writing is both pained and eloquent: . ""The few things we can confirm -- yes the four story Caribbean Market building is completely demolished,"" she posted. ""Yes it was open. Yes the National Palace collapsed. Yes Gov't buildings nearby the Palace collapsed. Yes St Josephs Boys home is completely collapsed. Yes countless countless - countless other houses, churches, hospitals, schools, and businesses have collapsed. There are buildings that suffered almost no damage. Right next door will be a pile of rubble. ""Thousands of people are currently trapped. To guess at a number would be like guessing at raindrops in the ocean. Precious lives hang in the balance. When pulled from the rubble there is no place to take them for care Haiti has an almost non existent medical care system for her people. ""I cannot imagine what the next few weeks and months will be like. I am afraid for everyone. Never in my life have I seen people stronger than Haitian people. But I am afraid for them. For us. ""When the quake hit it took many seconds to even process what was happening. The house was rocking back and forth in a way that I cannot even begin to describe. It felt fake. It felt like a movie. Things were crashing all over the house. It felt like the world was ending. I do not know why my house stands and my children all lie sleeping in their beds right now. It defies logic and my babies were spared while thousands of others were not. ""There are friends and co-workers that are missing. People whom no-one can account for. People we work with and love. There are more than I can name, but in particular we wait on one single friend who lived near the Hotel Montana -- which has reportedly collapsed."" She concludes the post with an appeal: . ""The horror has only just begun and I beg you to get on your knees -- I truly mean ON YOUR KNEES and pray for the people of this country.

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- The Japanese government has ordered repairs to seats aboard planes operating in several countries after accusing the manufacturer of falsifying safety test results. Koito Industries Ltd. falsified fire- and shock-resistance test results in the design and manufacturing of its aircraft seats, the Japanese Transport Ministry said in a news release. The company also failed to obtain the necessary approval from transportation authorities for the material it used in the back of seats, near the food tray drop-down, the ministry said. The problem affects 150,000 seats. The ministry has ordered Koito to fix the seats and establish quality-control measures. The affected airlines operate in Japan, the United States, China and Singapore. The seats are mainly aboard Boeing and Airbus planes, The New York Times quoted Koito President Takashi Kakewaga as saying Monday in Tokyo. Several airlines, including Continental Airlines, Singapore Airlines and All Nippon Airways, have postponed introducing aircraft recently because of delays in getting seats from Koito, the newspaper said. Koito is Japan's largest supplier of aircraft seats, manufacturing them for 32 carriers worldwide. Koito also manufactures and sells electrical equipment and is involved in housing construction. Toyota owns 20 percent of the shares of Koito Industries' parent company. The aircraft seat problem follows troubles with Toyota automobiles that have tarnished the company's image. On Tuesday, Toyota's president apologized as he announced the global recall of more than 400,000 of the automaker's 2010 hybrid models, including the popular Prius, for problems in their anti-lock braking systems. In addition, two problems involving gas pedals caused Toyota to recall 8.1 million vehicles worldwide since November. CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki contributed to this report.","Airline seat manufacturer accused of false test results, use of unapproved materials .

"London, England (CNN) -- The fashion world was Friday mourning the death of celebrated British designer Alexander McQueen as questions were raised over the future of his multi-million dollar luxury clothing brand. A day after McQueen was found dead in his London home, the 40-year-old's flagship store in the city was closed, while flowers were laid in honor and a flag was flown at half mast over the shuttered doorway. A manager at the Alexander McQueen store in New York, where similar memorial scenes of flowers and candles were reported, said the shop would also be closed in light of the designer's death. McQueen's New York fans show support . Emerging from a modest background as the son of an east London taxi driver to become a household name, McQueen's success has been hailed as a testament to his talent, but analysts say there are doubts his name will endure. Design brands have previously outlived their founders, with notable examples being the success of Frenchman Yves Saint Laurent's empire despite his death in 2008, and the survival of Gianni Versace's label following his 1997 murder. Industry insiders say McQueen's hands-on involvement in his business as the creative driving force behind the label's bold and eccentric output will be difficult to sustain without the designer at the helm. Gucci Group, which acquired a 51 percent stake in the McQueen brand in 2001, has yet to make a statement on the future of the label and its 11 stores worldwide which, according to the Financial Times, was not profitable until 2007. The fashion house has not disclosed current figures for the brand which, the Times of London newspaper reported Gucci paid £13.6 million ($21.2 million) for its stake in. Tim Gadoffre, CEO of luxury brand analyst Marival & Company, said McQueen's death represented a ""disaster"" for the brand and said there would be substantial doubts over the label's ability to survive its visionary founder's death. Says Gadoffre, despite huge celebrity success, the McQueen brand had only just been consolidated as a going concern and the next decade would have been crucial in converting the designer's name into a long-term franchise. ""It is too early to tell, but I'm not convinced it is possible to project the business any further without him,"" he told CNN. Nevertheless, retailers were reporting a sharp rise in sales of  McQueen items in the immediate wake of his death. A spokeswoman for the upscale Liberty of London department store told CNN it had seen a 14-fold increase in McQueen brand sales, with top sellers including his signature skull print scarf and main line collection. McQueen's death reportedly occurred on the eve of the funeral of his mother, Joyce, with whom he was said to have a very close relationship . Tributes have poured in for McQueen, with many in the fashion and film industry hailing the ""enfant terrible"" for his diverse clothing creations and for dressing stars such as Sarah Jessica Parker and Nicole Kidman. ""His brilliant imagination knew no bounds as he conjured up collection after collection of extraordinary designs,"" said British Vogue Editor Alexandra Shulman, adding that his work ""influenced a whole generation of designers."" ""His death is the hugest loss to anyone who knew him and for very many who didn't,"" she said in a statement on the magazine's Web site. ""We are deeply shocked and saddened at the news of Alexander McQueen's untimely death,"" said a statement on the London Fashion Week Web site. ""He was a unique talent and one of the world's greatest designers. Our thoughts are with his friends and family at this sad time."" Although McQueen was not showing a collection at the London Fashion Week, he was to unveil his ready-to-wear collection at the Paris fashion shows in March. His 2010 spring/summer collection featured alien-inspired makeup and prints, according to Vogue, and ""was lauded as his best by the fashion press."" Dresses in that ready-to-wear line had exaggerated tiny waists and rounded hips, and models on the catwalk wore high club-like boots with them. Model Naomi Campbell said she was ""truly devastated"" by McQueen's death. ""His talent had no boundaries and he was an inspiration to everyone who worked with him and knew him,"" she said in a statement released by her publicist. Designer Carolina Herrera called McQueen ""one of a -kind"" and said in a statement that he was ""one of the most talented designers of his generation. This is a big loss for the world."" The designer was born as Lee Alexander McQueen in 1970 in London's East End, the son of a taxi driver. He left school with few qualifications, but later studied fashion at London's prestigious St. Martin's College and worked on the famous Savile Row street of tailors at a company that made suits for Prince Charles. One anecdote that helped cement his bad-boy image claimed that he had once embroidered a suit for the Prince of Wales with a profanity sewn into the lining. His clothing line was purchased in 1991 by stylist Isabella Blow, who became a close friend. She committed suicide in 2007, five years after his label was brought into the Gucci Group.","NEW: Fate of McQueen's fashion brand uncertain after designer's death .

"College Park, Maryland (CNN) -- In his hectic, noisy laboratory at the University of Maryland, Michael Pecht is wary when it comes to assessing whether Toyota's suggested repair of sticky gas pedals will have any real impact. ""They are in a bit of a quandary,"" said Pecht, a professor at Maryland's Clark School of Engineering. ""If they announce that electronics is a problem, they are probably going to be in a lot of trouble, because nobody's going to drive the car. So at this stage, they don't want to announce there is any electronic problem."" But according to Pecht, who is an expert in failure analysis and has written a book on sudden acceleration in automobiles, complicated electronics -- not a mechanical issue with the gas pedal -- lie at the heart of Toyota's problems. And three other independent safety analysts contacted by CNN also conclude that neither floor mats nor stuck gas pedals are an overwhelming issue. ""From what people have told me about their sudden acceleration incidents, most of them have have got nothing to do with the sticking pedal at all,"" said Antony Anderson, an electronics consultant in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England. Anderson said electronic throttle controls, which largely have replaced mechanical accelerators, can malfunction in ways he compared to an occasionally disobedient child. ""We've all had that type of experience, and I'm afraid that is the sort of experience that can happen with any piece of electronics, with an electronic throttle,"" he said. And Sean Kane, who runs a company called Safety Research Strategies in Rehoboth, Massachusetts, said, ""Toyota's explanations do not account for the share of unintended acceleration complaints that we have examined."" Toyota officials dispute any assertion that the complicated array of electronics in its cars has an impact on the acceleration issues that have dominated headlines in the past weeks. ""After many years of exhaustive testing by us and by other organizations, we have found no evidence of an electronic problem in our electronic throttle control systems that could have led to unwanted acceleration,"" said John Hanson, Toyota's spokesman on quality-control issues. But experts like Anderson say the tests conducted by Toyota are not adequate. ""Those tests do not reproduce what actually happens in everyday life,"" Anderson said. ""They are testing for certain conditions, for certain standards, but they test, for example, signals one at a time. They don't do a whole lot of signals altogether. Whereas in a car, you've got a great cacophony of electromagnetic interference going on all the time, and you really can't rely on testing of a single frequency at one time."" As for the U.S. government's testing of Toyota's problems, the man in charge of the Center For Auto Safety, Clarence Ditlow, said that a 2007 test on a Lexus -- a Toyota brand -- by the National Highway Safety and Traffic Administration to find possible electronic interference was amateurish. ""They didn't do any real testing,"" he said. ""For all I know, they just took a garage door opener, pointed it at the engine compartment and snapped it, and that's electronic interference to see whether or not anything happened. They closed the hood, and off they went. No problem."" iReport: Prius owner stands by his car . Efforts to contact the NHTSA in snow-bound Washington were unsuccessful. But Toyota spokesman Hanson said, ""It's very easy to look from outside and say, 'There is no problem with the pedal.' But this is the problem and we are fixing it."" Hanson said the company ""invited"" further testing and pointed out that NHTSA officials announced a ""fresh look"" into the whole area of electromagnetic testing, not simply limited to Toyota.","They say complicated electronics, not mechanical issue, are problem .

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- The man who shot Pope John Paul II in 1981 was released from prison in Turkey Monday, Turkey's Anadolu news agency reported. Mehmet Ali Agca, now 52, severely wounded the pontiff in Rome's St. Peter's Square on May 13, 1981. John Paul spent six hours on an operating table and survived. Four days later he announced from his hospital bed he had forgiven the attempted assassin and urged the faithful to pray for Agca. The pope spent more than three weeks in Gemelli hospital recovering. Agca was arrested a few minutes after the attack, tried, and sentenced to 19 years in prison. He has never explained why he tried to kill the pope. There has long been suspicion that he was working for an eastern European Communist government angry at the Polish-born pope's vocal anti-Communism. But on a 2002 visit to Bulgaria -- a focus of much speculation -- the pope said he did not believe the Balkan state was behind the attempt on his life. The pope visited Agca in prison on December 27, 1983, and reportedly forgave him in person. Agca was granted clemency by the president of Italy in 2000, to John Paul's ""satisfaction,"" according to the Vatican. He was then transferred to his native Turkey, where he was re-arrested for the murder of a Turkish journalist in 1979. Agca killed Abdi Ipekci in 1979, Anadolu said. Ipekci was editor-in-chief of the daily Milliyet. Agca was due to be taken to a military facility to assess his fitness for military service after his release. In 2006, a military hospital ruled that he was not fit for the obligatory military service due to a severe anti-social personality disorder, but the Ministry of National Defense did not approve the exemption, the Turkish news agency said.","Mehmet Ali Agca severely wounded the pope in 1981 attack .

"(CNN) -- Previously missing police records on the 1986 shooting death of the brother of Alabama professor Amy Bishop -- accused of gunning down her colleagues last week -- have been found, and investigators said Tuesday they back a state police report that deemed the shooting an accident. The Braintree, Massachusetts, police records show that police in 1986 believed they had probable cause to arrest Bishop on some charges in her brother's death. However, no charges were filed in that case. Bishop is charged with capital murder and three counts of attempted murder in a Friday shooting at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, where she was a biology professor. She is eligible for the death penalty in Alabama. Authorities have said Bishop shot her brother, Seth, at the family's Braintree home in December 1986. A state police report on the 1986 incident was released to the news media over the weekend, but Braintree police said their records of the shooting were missing until Tuesday. Probable cause existed in 1986 for charges of assault with a dangerous weapon, carrying a dangerous weapon and unlawful possession of ammunition, according to a statement issued Tuesday by the office of Norfolk County, Massachusetts, District Attorney William Keating. The statute of limitations has passed on those charges, as well as on a potential charge of ""wanton and reckless conduct,"" the lowest standard for manslaughter in Massachusetts, according to the statement. The recovered documents don't contradict previously released information about the account of the siblings' mother, who told police she witnessed the shooting and said it was accidental, according to the statement. The statement did not explain how the records came to be missing or when or how they were found. The December 6, 1986, shooting of Seth Bishop came under renewed scrutiny after Friday's shooting at the University of Alabama in Huntsville.  Authorities said Bishop, also known as Amy Bishop Anderson, was attending a faculty meeting in a university building when she shot six colleagues. She was arrested as she was leaving the building. On Saturday, Braintree Police Chief Paul Frazier told reporters that the department's records pertaining to the 1986 shooting were missing. Braintree Mayor Joseph Sullivan announced Sunday  a search for the documents had been started, which resulted in the find announced Tuesday. Describing the 1986 shooting on Saturday, Frazier said that Bishop had fled her home with a gun after she shot her brother and had unsuccessfully attempted to pull over a driver in a vehicle. The newly recovered documents do not refer to an incident involving a vehicle. Frazier also said that police spotted Bishop and arrested her nearby, but she eventually was released. ""I cannot tell you what the thought process was behind our releasing her at the time,"" he said Saturday about the decades-old case. A 1987 state police report released over the weekend cited interviews between police and Bishop's parents, in which her mother said the gun discharged accidentally. Braintree police told state police investigators that ""indications were that Amy Bishop had been attempting to manipulate the shotgun and had subsequently brought the gun downstairs in an attempt to gain assistance from her mother in disarming the weapon"" when it went off, shooting her brother in the chest. Read the report on the 1986 shooting . But Frazier said Saturday that Officer Ronald Solimini, who was involved in the case 23 years ago, said that Bishop had shot her brother during an argument. John Polio, who was Braintree police chief in 1986, also said he recalled reports of an argument between the two. But neither the 1987 state police report nor the newly found documents detail a disagreement between the siblings. The state report references a disagreement between Bishop and her father, who was not home when the shooting occurred. In an uncovered December 6, 1986, record, then-police Lt. James Sullivan wrote that Bishop ""stated earlier there had been a family 'spat' and she had gone to her room. (Unknown at this time how much earlier this family 'spat' had been)."" Police decided not to file charges, the December 6, 1986, report by Sullivan indicates, because ""with the current information it would appear to be an accidental shooting.""","NEW: Massachusetts police department's '86 records don't dispute state report .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- NBC host Jay Leno is going back to late nights after a low-rated experiment in prime time, the network announced Sunday. Leno's prime-time talk show, which debuted in September, ""didn't meet affiliates' needs,"" said Jeff Gaspin, chairman of NBC Universal Television Entertainment. The program will go off the air February 12, when the 2010 Winter Olympics begin. The network is now negotiating with Leno and its current late-night hosts, Conan O'Brien and Jimmy Fallon, to decide who ends up with which time slot, Gaspin said. O'Brien took over NBC's flagship ""Tonight Show"" when Leno moved to the 10 p.m. slot in September. Fallon took over O'Brien's former show, ""Late Night."" Gaspin said the plan now is for Leno to host a new, half-hour show at 11:35 p.m. ET, followed by ""Tonight"" with O'Brien at 12:05 a.m. Fallon's show would move to the 1 a.m. hour, he said. Do you think NBC did the right thing? The goal is to keep all three hosts, but nothing was a done deal as of Sunday, he said. Reports of the shakeup first emerged last week. Leno dismissed them on his show on Thursday night, telling his audience, ""It's always been my experience NBC only cancels you when you're in first place."" Leno's move to prime time was a risk for NBC, because it put a talk show up against scripted prime-time shows and ran it five days a week. Network spokeswoman Rebecca Marks said last week that Leno performed ""exactly as we anticipated on the network."" But for NBC's affiliates, Leno's low ratings were taking viewers -- and the resulting ad dollars -- away from their late local newscasts. ""The 11 o'clock news hours were bleeding ratings,"" said Stuart Levine, an analyst for the entertainment trade paper Variety. While NBC appeared to be fine with Leno's numbers, the affiliates ""kind of revolted and said we have to have better ratings,"" Levine said. Michael Fiorile, the chairman of NBC's affiliate board, called the decision announced Sunday ""a great move for the affiliates, the network and, most importantly, the viewers."" ""We admire their willingness to innovate, and their willingness to change course when it didn't work for us,"" Fiorile said in a written statement. For NBC, which had promised to give Leno a full year in the 10 p.m. time slot, ""It's certainly a little bit of egg on the face,"" Levine said. Mediaweek analyst Marc Berman called the network's gamble on Leno ""the biggest fiasco in the history of television."" ""What they didn't realize was that the people who watched Leno in late night were not necessarily the same people who watched in prime time, so there was no reason to believe that his audience would follow him to prime time,"" Berman said. Meanwhile, the O'Brien-helmed ""Tonight"" lost about half its audience ""and actually really hurt late night, which is a big profit center for NBC,"" Berman said. Moving ""Tonight"" -- which has held its current slot for decades -- back a half-hour is likely to hurt the show, and Berman predicted that NBC will be unable to keep all three hosts. ""My guess is down the road, they will give back Leno the 'Tonight Show,' leave it on at 11:35 p.m., and Conan will move to Fox,"" he said. ""But if I was either one of those gentlemen, I would be looking elsewhere right now."" CNN's Doug Hyde contributed to this report.","NEW: Mediaweek analyst predicts at least one among Leno, O'Brien and Fallon will leave .

"(CNN) -- U.S. President George W. Bush on Tuesday will designate nine sites in three areas of the central Pacific as marine national monuments, White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said Monday. The new designated areas make up the largest area of ocean set aside for marine conservation in the world. The new areas make up the largest area of ocean set aside for marine conservation in the world -- 195,280 square miles -- and, coupled with a 138,000-square mile designation in Hawaii two years go, mean that Bush will have protected more of the ocean than any other president. ""The president's actions will prevent the destruction and extraction of natural resources from these beautiful and biologically diverse areas without conflicting with our military's activities and freedom of navigation, which are vital to our national security,"" Perino said. ""And the public and future generations will benefit from the science and knowledge gained from these areas."" Bush is using the 1906 Antiquities Act -- first used by President Theodore Roosevelt to set aside public lands such as the Grand Canyon as national monuments -- for the designation. Many of those lands later became national parks. Bill Chandler, vice president for government affairs for the non-profit Marine Conservation Biology Institute (MCBI), said Bush is ""to be commended"" for his action. ""From a conservation history perspective, the message here is that Teddy Roosevelt laid the groundwork for our national park system when he withdrew a lot of public lands and called them national monuments,"" said Chandler. ""We see the president laying the foundation for a system of national marine preserves and parks,"" he said. ""We had lacked such a system for a long time."" MCBI and the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) partnered to identify eight of the nine sites the president will set aside on Tuesday. All but one of those eight remote areas already have Fish and Wildlife Service refuge areas at their cores. ""You have a core conservation mission already,"" Chandler said. ""This is just basically going to expand them."" The MCBI/EDF-identified sites are Rose Atoll, Wake Island, Johnston Island, Palmyra Island, Kingman Reef, Baker Island, Howland Island and Jarvis Island. Rose Atoll, part of American Samoa, is the smallest atoll in the world, but more than 500 fish species swim in the waters around it, and it supports 97 percent of America Samoa's seabird population. It is also the nesting ground for several threatened turtle species. The Pew Environmental Fund identified the ninth site -- the waters around the northern Marianas and the deepest ocean canyon in the world, the Mariana Trench, 11,033 meters (36,201 feet) at its deepest. The new designations will expand protection to a 50 nautical mile area off the islands, where commercial fishing will be prohibited. Other uses of the area -- research or recreational fishing -- will be allowed but will require a permit. Bush has not gotten rave reviews for his conservation efforts on land -- according to the Audubon Society, he's signed wilderness legislation covering a little more than 2 million acres, fewer than any other president except Richard Nixon. But Chandler said that Bush ""has really embraced ocean conservation as his own."" ""Ocean protection ... is lagging 50 to 100 years behind land conservation, he said. ""This is precisely the kind of leadership that we need to get the message across that there are places in the ocean that are rich with diversity."" ""Scientists already know this,"" he said. ""They have been calling for this for 10 or 15 years."" The president can cut through the bureaucracy that makes protecting resources such a lengthy process, and the Antiquities Act is a strong tool for those efforts. With the Act, the president can make a designation by executive order, essentially ""writing the prescription for conservation"" for an area, Chandler said.","Bush designates 9 sites in 3 areas of central Pacific as marine national monuments .

"Washington (CNN) -- The father's first comment, when he heard I was in his city to talk about a book I'd written about kids, mental health issues and medication, came loudly and fast: ""When my daughter was 10, my ex-wife and a psychiatrist called to try to get my permission to put her on Prozac. I refused,"" he said proudly. ""I wasn't going to let them drug my kid."" We spent quite a few hours together. By nighttime, as he drove me back from the last event, his mood was altered, his tone notably more somber. It had been a day of impassioned testimonials from parents of children with mental health issues, and even from one teenager, who called in to a radio show to describe how taking medication for his attention deficit hyperactivity disorder had helped him ""level the playing field"" with other kids and made it possible for him to attend college. ""I don't know if we did the right thing by her,"" the dad said at last, thinking of his daughter as he looked out at the dark road ahead. His daughter's life had never really come together. She had dropped out of college; her future was unclear. She presented a happy face to her dad, but deep down, he felt, the truth of her life wasn't so sunny. ""I don't know how to read her,"" he said. ""I really don't know what to do."" We all know what the prevailing opinion is these days on children's mental health in America: Kids with nothing truly wrong with them are being over-diagnosed and overmedicated by doctors, parents and schools, who are colluding to make them better behaved, more high-performing and more tractable to our society's unnaturally high demands. This opinion used to be mine. It was the basic line of my argument at the beginning of my research, when the only information-gathering I'd done on the topic consisted of reading and compiling the already-recycled reporting of others. But soon, the facts got in the way. Surveys and statistics showed that the story of over-diagnosis and overmedication was wrong; 5 percent of children in America take psychotropic medication, while 5 to 20 percent are estimated to have mental health issues. The vast majority of those in need of help never get any care at all. The facts are incontrovertible: Kids' mental health issues are real, they're serious, and they often cause profound suffering. And they're not new. Listening to parents gave me a very concrete answer to the question so many skeptics ask as to where all the kids with ""issues"" were a generation ago. We existed, many of the parents of kids who now are getting diagnosed told me. And no one noticed that we were suffering. And, they said, they weren't going to let the same not-noticing, or the same labeling with words like ""lazy"" or ""stupid"" or ""bad,"" happen to their kids today. Interviews with about 100 parents and doctors showed that rather than rushing to pathologize and medicate their kids, parents did all they could to avoid ""labeling"" their children and put off using medication -- if they used it at all -- until they really were desperate. What these interviews showed above all is that for parents and children (and grown children) dealing with mental health issues, life is complicated, unsure and filled with unanswered questions that can't be addressed by gross generalizations about the ""medicated child"" in our time. It's very hard to get at any of that complexity -- and humanity -- when we typically talk about children's mental health in the media. Journalism generally doesn't lend itself to complicated messages; we need eye-grabbing headlines and strong voices spouting easy-to-summarize arguments, opinions which, in the strangely evolving media world of today, have come to have far greater currency than fact. In another city, a mother told me that she'd never attended college. She would have liked to have gone, she said, but she earned almost all Cs in high school, and no one had ever presented it to her as a possibility. ""I don't think I was dumb,"" she said, ""I just couldn't keep my mind focused on my work."" At 48, she wondered, was it too late to find out if she had the inattentive kind of ADHD? She'd become a model after high school instead. She'd married a lawyer; she lived in the kind of community where former high achievers made a second career of micromanaging their children's lives. She wanted to be an involved mother, too, but when she spoke at school meetings, the high-power moms made her feel invisible. ""They talk right over me,"" she said. ""It's like I don't exist."" Her husband was out of work. After so many decades, her own lack of a college degree still burned as a cause of embarrassment, worry and resentment. How could her parents, she mused aloud, not have encouraged her to try to at least try to get into college? It is very easy to look at a woman like this and say, who cares? She turned out OK -- more than OK, after all. But her voice was full of pain as she talked about the feelings of inferiority that still haunted her. Hadn't she had the right to at least try to live up to her potential? She was committed to making sure that her daughter would have every possible option. Behind the black-and-white shouting matches that now dominate discussions of children's mental health in our country, there are stories like these. They aren't necessarily headline-making. But they're powerful, and true. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Judith Warner.","Judith Warner says common view is modern parents over-medicate kids for mental health .
But her research showed that most parents avoid meds, are sensitive to kids' suffering .
Kids' mental health issues not new; now better diagnosed, so seem newly prevalent, she says .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama will welcome Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for an official state visit Tuesday. The two leaders will discuss a range of global, regional and bilateral issues, the White House said. Those discussions are likely to center on Afghanistan, climate change and nuclear energy cooperation. Singh has been quoted as saying that a Taliban victory in Afghanistan would be disastrous for Central and South Asia. Singh's visit will be the first state visit hosted by the administration, the highest honor extended to a foreign dignitary. It will be Singh's second visit to Washington; he has also met with former President George W. Bush. Grammy- and Oscar-award-winning singer and actress Jennifer Hudson will entertain the black-tie crowd, several sources involved in the planning outside the administration said. Hudson, raised in Chicago like first lady Michelle Obama, sang the National Anthem at the Democratic National Convention in August 2008 at the request of the Obama campaign, when Obama became the Democratic presidential nominee. Singh arrived Sunday for his five-day visit. On Monday, he attended a luncheon hosted by the U.S.-India Business Council and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He addressed the Council on Foreign Relations later in the day. Obama will receive the prime minister at the White House on Tuesday, and Singh and his wife will be the guests at an official state dinner Tuesday night. On Wednesday, Singh will meet with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Defense Secretary Robert Gates and will later attend a reception for the Indian community hosted by Indian Ambassador to the United States Meera Shankar. Singh will leave Washington Thursday morning and fly to Port of Spain, Trinidad, to attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government summit. Singh, 77, is a Cambridge- and Oxford-educated economist who was governor of the Reserve Bank of India from 1982 to 1985 and the nation's finance minister from 1991 to 1996. A member of the Congress Party, he is serving a second five-year term as prime minister. He was sworn in as prime minister in May 2004 and again this past May. He and his wife of 51 years, Gursharan Kaur, have three daughters.","Visit by Indian PM Manmohan Singh is first state visit for Obama administration .

"(CNN) -- Maj. Gen. Robert Harding said Friday that, ""with deep regret,"" he has withdrawn his name from nomination to lead the Transportation Security Administration. ""This was a great honor, and I felt that I could bring some leadership, vision and intelligence expertise to that position,"" he said in a statement. ""Ultimately, my goal was to improve the security of our nation's transportation systems. However, I feel that the distractions caused by my work as a defense contractor would not be good for this administration nor for the Department of Homeland Security."" The TSA is part of the Department of Homeland Security. White House Spokesman Nicholas Shapiro noted that Harding has more than 35 years of military and intelligence experience, and added, ""The President is disappointed in this outcome but remains confident in the solid team of professionals at TSA."" At a hearing on Wednesday, Harding acknowledged ""making mistakes"" when a company he formed overbilled the government in 2004. At issue is a contract that Harding's company, Harding Security Associates, signed with the Defense Department in early 2004 to provide 40 interrogators and debriefers rapidly in Iraq. Within four months of his firm starting work on the contract, Harding said, the government decided to end the contract. ""I then faced 40 individuals who were now without work,"" the nominee said, adding that some of them he had lured away from other jobs, including the CIA. Harding said he told his employees ""that I would take care of them, and that I would negotiate and work with the government to provide severance payments."" The total severance payments came to about $800,000, Harding said. ""When I went to claim it from the DIA [Defense Intelligence Agency],"" government auditors ""recognized that I did not have a policy on that, that I had not negotiated with the government for severance, I had not provided the government my plan for severance ... and therefore it was not allowed, that $800,000."" Harding said that government auditors subsequently admitted ""there were mistakes on both sides."" The White House said it was ""disappointed"" at Harding's withdrawal. ""By nominating General Harding, the president tapped an individual with more than 35 years of military and intelligence experience who is dedicated to improving the security of our nation,"" Shapiro said. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said she felt misled by a White House explanation of the events. The White House compared $2.4 million in disputed charges that included the $800,000 in severance payments to the $53 million potential value of the contract, instead of the $6 million value of the work. ""Of the $6 million that HSA was paid, $2.4 million was [in] question. That's a pretty high percentage. The White House, in talking to me about this issue, compared it to $53 million, but that's not what was at stake here at all, and I thought the White House's comparison was pretty misleading,"" Collins said. An independent investigation concluded that no fraud was involved. Ultimately, HSA reached a settlement with the government, with HSA paying back $1.8 million of the disputed $2.4 million. Harding said he learned from his mistake. He said the mistake caused him to add an accounting operation and otherwise professionalize the business, eventually increasing it in size from 60 people in 2004 to about 400 people when he sold the business last year. Following the hearing, Collins said that Harding ""adequately addressed my concerns regarding"" the contracts. ""Before making a final determination, however, I want to review additional information in order to ensure that all relevant data regarding the nominee have been thoroughly examined,"" she said. Harding was Obama's second nominee to head the agency. Sen. James DeMint, R-South Carolina, put a hold on the first nominee, Erroll Southers, after Southers declined to say whether he supported unionization of screeners. Southers eventually withdrew his name from consideration after another controversy erupted involving a decades-old personnel matter.","Robert Harding removes himself from consideration to lead TSA .

"(CNN) -- Governors in three Eastern Seaboard states Friday called on National Guard troops to help evacuate people from flooding caused by the remnants of Tropical Storm Ida. Strong winds and rain from the powerful storm have left thousands without power. Ida lost momentum but not the ability to generate winds and rain as it made landfall on the U.S. Gulf Coast earlier this week, forecasters said. The National Weather Service had flood advisories in effect Friday for areas of coastal Pennsylvania, Delaware and New Jersey. At least 160 National Guard troops were deployed in sections of Virginia, Delaware and New Jersey to evacuate residents in high-water areas as well as provide cots, sandbags and potable water, according to the Pentagon's National Guard Bureau. ""About 40 members of the Delaware National Guard have provided support to civilian emergency relief agencies in Kent and Sussex counties,"" the bureau said. The New Jersey National Guard sent 18 guardsmen with trucks to help with evacuations in the Cape May and Atlantic counties, where the governor Thursday declared a state of emergency due to flooding, Guard officials reported . Almost 100 guardsmen with high-water vehicles were helping firefighters in Portsmouth, Virginia. Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine declared a state of emergency, saying the remnants of Ida had combined with another storm to cause dangerous conditions in some areas. By early afternoon, at least 155,000 customers were without power in the state -- mostly in and around Norfolk, according to the Dominion Power Web site. ""With the National Weather Service indicating that eastern Virginia could experience flooding and storm surge comparable to the effects of a Category 1 hurricane, it's critical that Virginians make the necessary preparations,"" Kaine said. ""While we will continue to monitor conditions, the commonwealth is preparing for a period of coastal flooding through at least Friday evening.""","Strong winds and rain from the powerful storm have left thousands without power.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court granted a temporary stay of execution late Wednesday for a condemned Texas inmate who is requesting DNA testing of evidence in his case. The order was handed down less than an hour before Henry ""Hank"" Skinner, 47, was scheduled to be executed by injection for the New Year's Eve 1993 killings of his live-in girlfriend and her two sons. The Supreme Court granted the temporary stay while it considers whether to take up Skinner's broader appeal. It was not immediately clear when the court might consider the case, but there was no indication a decision would be made before Thursday. Skinner's attorneys maintain that DNA testing of the evidence could establish his innocence and determine the real killer. ""This action suggests that the court believes there are important issues that require closer examination,"" defense attorney Robert Owen said of the temporary stay. ""We remain hopeful that the court will agree to hear Mr. Skinner's case and ultimately allow him the chance to prove his innocence through DNA testing."" Skinner heard the news while he was eating what was to be his last meal, according to Michelle Lyons, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. He expressed relief and surprise, saying, ""I had made up my mind I was going to die"" and ""I feel like I really won today,"" according to Lyons. Skinner said he is ""eager to get the DNA testing so I can prove my innocence and get the hell out of here,"" according to Lyons. Texas Gov. Rick Perry has received more than 8,000 letters from Skinner's advocates urging a stay, according to the Innocence Project and Change.org, whose members and supporters have sent the letters through their Web sites. State Sen. Rodney Ellis and state Rep. Elliott Naishtat were among those who have called for a reprieve. ""It has come to my attention that there are numerous problems with Mr. Skinner's case that raise serious questions regarding the fairness of his trial and whether or not he is guilty,"" Ellis wrote in a letter to Perry on Tuesday. Word about the case has spread as far as France, where demonstrations were planned Wednesday at the U.S. Embassy in Paris by supporters of Skinner's French wife, Sandrine Ageorges. Since Skinner's conviction in 1995, he ""has tirelessly pursued access to the untested physical evidence,"" according to court documents filed with the Supreme Court in February. That evidence includes vaginal swabs and fingernail clippings from Skinner's then-girlfriend Twila Busby, hairs found in her hand and two knives found at the scene, along with a dish towel and a windbreaker jacket, according to the filing. Skinner has never denied being in the home when Busby and her sons -- Elwin Caler, 22, and Randy Busby, 20, -- were killed. However, he maintains he was incapacitated because of the ""extreme quantities of alcohol and codeine"" that he had consumed earlier that evening, according to the documents. Prosecutors maintain forensic evidence gathered at the scene and witness statements point to Skinner. A female friend of Skinner's who lived four blocks away testified at Skinner's trial that he walked to her trailer and told her that he may have kicked Twila Busby to death, although evidence did not show she had been kicked. The neighbor has since recanted parts of her testimony. Authorities followed a blood trail from the crime scene to the female friend's trailer and found Skinner in the closet, authorities said. He was ""wearing heavily blood-stained jeans and socks and bearing a gash on the palm of his right hand,"" according to the Texas attorney general's summary of the case. In addition, authorities said cuts on Skinner's hand came from the knife used to stab the men. Skinner said he cut it on glass. Some DNA testing was done, which implicated Skinner, but not on the items he now wants tested. ""DNA testing showed that blood on the shirt Skinner was wearing at the time of his arrest was Twila's blood, and blood on Skinner's jeans was a mixture of blood from Elwin and Twila,"" authorities said. However, Owen wrote in the Supreme Court filing, ""the victims' injuries show that whoever murdered them must have possessed considerable strength, balance and coordination."" Twila Busby was strangled so forcefully that her larynx and the hyoid bone in her throat were broken. She then was struck with an axe or pick handle 14 times, hard enough to drive fragments of her ""unusually thick skull"" into her brain, the court documents said. ""While attacking Ms. Busby, the perpetrator had to contend with the presence of her 6-foot-6-inch, 225-pound son, Elwin Caler, who blood spatter analysis showed was in the immediate vicinity of his mother as she was being beaten,"" the court filing said. ""Somehow, the murderer was able to change weapons and stab Caler several times before he could fend off the attack or flee."" Randy Busby was then stabbed to death in the bedroom the two brothers shared, the documents said. Evidence presented at trial suggested that Twila Busby's uncle, Robert Donnell -- who is now dead -- could have been the killer. At a New Year's Eve party she attended for a short time on the last night of her life, Donnell stalked her, making crude sexual remarks, according to trial testimony. A friend who drove her home from the party testified she was ""fidgety and worried"" and that Donnell was no longer at the party when he returned. ""The defense presented evidence that Donnell was a hot-tempered ex-con who had sexually molested a girl, grabbed a pregnant woman by the throat and kept a knife in his car,"" according to Owen's letter to Perry. An expert testified at trial that Skinner would have been too intoxicated to commit the crimes, and a review of the evidence suggests that Skinner might have been even more intoxicated than initially thought, Owen writes. Media outlets in Texas have been supportive of a reprieve for Skinner. ""Before sending a man to die, we need to be absolutely sure of his guilt,"" the Houston Chronicle wrote in an editorial Friday. Skinner's wife, Ageorges, told Radio France Internationale in a Tuesday interview that she began writing to Skinner in 1996 and they began visiting in 2000. ""I'm convinced of his innocence not because I love him and he's my husband, I'm convinced of his innocence ... [because] there is scientific forensic evidence to prove that he was not even in a state to stand up at the time of the crime let alone murder three people that he loved,"" Ageorges told CNN's ""Larry King Live"" on Wednesday night after the stay had been granted. ""There is absolutely no motive."" Ageorges also said she finds it ""mind-boggling that evidence preserved from the crime scene 15 years later -- including the murder weapon, a rape kit, nail clippings from one of the victims, a male jacket that doesn't fit his size at all with sweat, hair, DNA -- to this day is not tested."" Recently, questions have swirled in Texas regarding the 2004 execution of Cameron Todd Willingham for a fire that killed his three daughters. On March 19, Perry issued a posthumous pardon to the family of Timothy Cole, who was serving a 25-year sentence for aggravated sexual assault when he died in prison from an asthma attack. After his death, DNA tests established his innocence, and another man confessed to the crime.

"Washington (CNN) -- Increased fighting in Afghanistan has caused a drop in morale among U.S. soldiers while the reduction in combat in Iraq has bolstered morale, according to a new U.S. Army report released Friday. The report summarizes two surveys of U.S. soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan taken earlier this year. New statistics from the Army also show suicides are up in the entire service. Produced every two years by the Army's Mental Health Advisory Team, this latest report comes just over a week after a U.S. soldier went on a shooting rampage at a U.S. Army base in Texas and possibly just days or weeks from an announcement from the Obama administration to send more troops to Afghanistan, where fighting has gotten more intense in recent months. Authorities have not determined a motive for the shooting. The suspect, Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, was scheduled to deploy to Afghanistan but had told his family that he wanted to get out of the military. ""Soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan continue to face stress from multiple deployments into combat but report being more prepared for the stresses of deployments,"" Lt. Gen. Eric Schoomaker, the Army Surgeon General told reporters Friday. Not surprisingly, the report showed that soldiers with multiple deployments, three or four tours of duty to Iraq or Afghanistan, had much lower morale and more mental health problems than those soldiers who have one or two combat deployments. Increased time at home, however, resulted in improved morale among troops sent back to the field. The updated survey of soldiers in Afghanistan found post-traumatic stress syndrome and depression in soldiers at the same levels of the survey in 2007, but still about double that of the 2005 survey results: 21.4 percent in 2009, 23.4 percent for 2007 and 10.4 percent in 2005, according to the report. In Iraq, where the survey has been done every year, lower numbers were attributed to the decrease in combat action there. The 2009 numbers showed 13.3 percent of soldiers suffering from mental health problems, compared to 18.8 percent in 2007 and 22 percent in 2006. Army officials said that with the push of more than 20,000 additional troops into the Afghan theater of battle over the last few months, there have been fewer mental health professionals in the field to help. Army officials said the ration was about one mental health professional for every 1,120 soldiers. To combat the falling morale and lack of mental health professionals in the field, Army officials said the service needs to more than double the number of mental health providers and hopes to have at least 65 more of those providers in the field by December, making the ratio one for every 700 soldiers. The mental health assessment teams also conducted interviews with soldiers and found a drop in unit morale in Afghanistan to about half of what it was in 2007 and 2005, when about 10 percent surveyed gave top ratings to unit morale. In 2009, that number was 5.7 percent. The report also showed soldiers are seeing more difficulty at home with an increasing number reporting they are getting or considering getting divorced, according to the report. The overall report was based on almost 4,000 soldiers who filled out anonymous surveys in Iraq and Afghanistan between December 2008 and June 2009. In Iraq, 2,400 soldiers were randomly selected and the results were studied by a mental health assessment team in the combat zone. About 1,500 troops in Afghanistan took the survey, Army officials said. The survey was different from previous years when all types of soldiers were surveyed together. The 2009 survey questioned combat troops and support troops separately, though Army officials said there were few differences in the results. On Friday, the Army also released its latest suicide statistics. They show an increase in the number over this time last year. The Army reported 133 suspected suicides as of October; there were 115 as of October 2008. Of the 133, 90 have been confirmed, and 43 are pending confirmation, according to an Army press release. Last year the Army totaled 140 suicides in its ranks, the highest the service has recorded. ""Stigma continues to be one of the most difficult challenges we confront,"" said Brig. Gen. Colleen McGuire, the director of the Suicide Prevention Task Force for the Army. ""The more we educate our Army community about the need to get help, the need to get it early, and that a full recovery is often possible, the less stigma we'll see."" The Army has implemented a number of suicide prevention programs over the past year, including training, a suicide prevention task force and a day off official duties to focus on suicide prevention.","Report summarizes 2 surveys of soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan taken this year .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN)  -- In the central plaza, there was once an orgy of music, street dancing and revelry unmatched by any other nation in the Americas, Haitians say. But where there was joy now sits a vast settlement of people left without loved ones, without homes, without life's belongings. Haitians have celebrated Carnival through dictatorships, military coups and bloodshed. Popular belief was that if a government failed to deliver on Carnival, Haiti's equivalent of Mardi Gras, it was sure to fall, said Marie Laurence Lassegue, Haiti's minister of culture and information. But this year, the three-day festival has been canceled, another indication of the enormity of the earthquake's devastation. Musicians fell silent, seamstresses stopped sewing costumes and ghostly skeletons of unfinished floats lay scattered on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince. A month after the devastating January 12 earthquake, the Champs de Mars plaza is home to the capital's displaced, where thousands of people have eked out a tiny space in which to survive. Full coverage of the earthquake's aftermath . ""This is the first time Carnival is not happening,"" said Roberto Martino, lead singer of popular Kompa band T-Vice. ""I don't even think about music anymore."" Less than a week ahead of Carnival's start on Sunday, revelry is replaced with mourning. The nation's foremost concert producer, Charles Jubert, died. So did members of four bands who were practicing inside a studio that collapsed. Other musicians lost legs, arms and hands. They will not be able to play again. ""I don't think we have time to think of Carnival,"" Lassegue said. ""Maybe when we are finished crying."" Carnival's three days of deliverance and celebration has tremendous importance in the lives of Haitians, Lassegue said. ""But this year? I don't even remember when it is."" Instead, the displaced are planning days of prayer. ""We're living in a city that's like a cemetery,"" said Ronide Baduel, a nurse who lost her home and all her belongings in the quake. Her brother died and suddenly, she found herself far from her middle-class existence, relegated to a makeshift tent and burlap bags she uses for pillows at night. ""I had four good walls around me. Now I have four sheets,"" she said. She goes to work with a big, black faux-leather purse containing toothpaste, soap and a change of underwear. There, she can bathe properly. ""We don't know how many days, how many months, how long we will be this way,"" she said. ""I am always stressed. It's like living in a jungle. How can I dance at Carnival?"" Baduel and her tent community neighbors said the money that would have been spent on Carnival ought to be used to build housing. Nearby, the 44 members of Relax Band, who normally would be revving up their street performances in the days before Carnival, worried about their next meal. They played the Sunday before the earthquake, marching through the streets, getting ready for the big performance. Now, everything was gone,­ including all their instruments that were crushed when band coordinator Ernst Beauvais' house collapsed. A small stage emblazoned with the red and white logo of Relax Band now harbors a massive water bladder tank dropped off by an aid group and a few mattresses for slumber under the stars. ""It is one of the greatest tragedies to befall our country,"" Beauvais said, pointing to the rubble of his house. He said it was the street band's 30th anniversary; the musicians were looking forward to showcasing their new song. Almost every band in Haiti debuts new pieces at Carnival. On the outskirts of town, the skeletons of three floats sit like ghosts, reminders of what might have come next week. One of the floats belongs to T-Vice. Bandmates Roberto Martino and Eddy Viau would have been practicing with the rest of the band for their Carnival performance ­-- it's an honor to win top prize. ""If you have a good showing at Carnival, you're set for the rest of the year,"" Martino said. This year, the band had planned a soccer-themed show with a song called ""The End of the Match."" Instead it recently released ""Nou Pap Lage'' (We Won't Give Up""), dedicated to the victims of the earthquake. iReport: Looking for loved ones in Haiti . Martino tried to sing a few verses. ""There are so many things going through my head,"" he said. Overcome by emotion, he had to compose himself and start again. ""People are saying Haiti is finished, but no, no, no, we will rise up,'' he sang softly. ""We will strive. We will rebuild Haiti. We will stand united."" ""Don't be discouraged. There will be light at the end of the tunnel. My Haitian people. I will not let go."" Proceeds from downloads of the song are going to the nonprofit organizations Sow A Seed and MedShare. Music, Martino said, was so essential to Haitian life. But he didn't know when this rare silence would end; when he would be able to write lyrics, put them to melody. ""We're all so traumatized,"" he said. Carnival, he said, was Haiti's musical showcase. ""We've lost our biggest tradition. Carnival was part of us.""","Less than week ahead of Haiti's Carnival celebration, revelry replaced with mourning .

"LONDON, England -- Evander Holyfield has raised the prospect of a rematch of his infamous world heavyweight title fight with Mike Tyson despite both men being into their 40s. Holyfield (right) grimaces after being bitten by Tyson in their 1997 fight. Holyfield took Tyson's crown in an epic bout in 1996, but it was their second fight a year later that is remembered for all the wrong reasons with Tyson disqualified for biting a chunk out of his opponent's ear. Holyfield, 45, has revealed he is considering an offer from 41-year-old Tyson's camp to meet in the ring for a third time. ""There has been some talk between us,"" Holyfield told The Guardian newspaper on Thursday. ""Mike had Jeff Fenech, who's been training him, call me a few months ago. Jeff says Mike wants to fight me again - but he needs to know if I would agree to it. ""I said, 'It all depends on what they are going to give us - because I'm gonna catch a lot of flak if I say I'm fighting Mike Tyson again. I've already said I don't want to fight Mike no more'. ""Jeff says, 'What if Mike gets in proper shape?' I told him that's OK but I can't be part of it if Mike's going to pull out. Jeff said, 'The main thing Mike wants to know is if you would be willing to fight him again?' I said, 'Yeah, if the price is right, I probably would'."" Both fighters have made largely unsuccessful attempts at comebacks in recent years with Holyfield continuing his pursuit of an unlikely fifth title against the advice of boxing experts. He is believed to have held on to a large portion of his career earnings, but, by contrast, Tyson has suffered well-publicized financial problems.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- An increase in the number of suicides among military personnel can be traced, in part, to a ""stressed and tired force"" made vulnerable by multiple deployments, a military leader said Wednesday. Long troop deployments in Iraq, above, and Afghanistan have been cited in the rise in military suicides. ""We must find ways to relieve some of this stress,"" said Gen. Peter W. Chiarelli, vice chief of staff of the Army, in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Military Personnel Subcommittee. ""I think it is the cumulative effect of deployments from 12 to 15 months,"" he said, adding that the longer deployments are scheduled to continue until June. He cited long deployments, lengthy separations from family and the perceived stigma associated with seeking help as factors contributing to the suicides. Adm. Patrick M. Walsh, vice chief of naval operations, said suicides are the third leading cause of death in the Navy. ""We must eliminate the perceived stigma, shame and dishonor of asking for help,"" he said. Gen. James F. Amos, assistant commandant of the Marine Corps, said his branch of the service has incorporated education and training about suicide prevention ""at all levels."" He said four of 55 mental health professionals deployed in the U.S. Central Command were recently embedded with Marines. He expressed optimism that that tactic would pay off, but he said he had no data to support his expectation. And Gen. William M. Fraser, vice chief of staff of the Air Force, said his branch, too, was taking steps ""to ensure airmen are as mentally prepared for deployment and redeployment as they are physically and professionally."" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said the efforts have not sufficed. He noted that last year, for the first time, the suicide rate among military personnel has exceeded that of the civilian population. ""What's going on?"" he asked rhetorically. The panel members made clear that, whatever is going on, it is complex. Chiarelli said the Army tallied 133 confirmed suicides last year and is still investigating another seven possible ones. At least 70 percent of the suicides had ""some kind of relationship problem,"" he said. Often, the situation was worsened by something else, such as a financial or legal problem, he said. And it wasn't just the trauma of war that appears to heighten the risk. The suicides were about evenly divided among those who had returned from deployment, those who were still deployed -- some on a third or fourth tour -- and those who had never been deployed, Chiarelli said. All of the military leaders said they had too few mental health professionals in their ranks. But Walsh said professionals are not the only people who must be trained to intervene, noting that it is often the shipmate or the battle buddy who seeks assistance for someone in need. And Navy counselors are now asking family members for feedback that often proves more illuminating than what the sailors themselves are willing to impart, he said. ""If I survey the family, I'm going to get a different set of answers."" One reason some service personnel are reluctant to seek help from their chain of command is because they fear they will then be passed over for promotions, the panel members said. In some cases, they pay out of their own pockets to seek help privately, Rubenstein said. And others call civilian hotlines, one of which reported getting three calls per day this year from active-duty military personnel. Representatives of all of the branches of the military said they have seen recent increases in suicides. At the Pentagon, Defense Secretary William Gates said he believes the 15-month deployments ""were a real strain"" on many, but expressed optimism that beneficial changes are in the works. ""All the services are are addressing this problem, but the Army in particular, I think, is really going after it in a very aggressive way,"" he said. But some suicides appear to defy all prevention efforts. Maj. Gen. David A. Rubenstein, deputy surgeon general of the Army, cited the case of a 33-year-old soldier who was living at home with his wife and three children. He suffered a traumatic brain injury more than two years ago and had been giving weekly motivational speeches to other soldiers in a clinic. For the past two years, the soldier also had been seeing a psychiatrist. The most recent visit occurred last Friday. On Monday, he saw his primary care doctor and his nurse case manager, and also had a life-skills appointment. ""On Tuesday, he apparently committed suicide,"" Rubenstein said. ""This soldier was treated, compliant and supported in every way, and yet he's dead today."" The suicide underscores that suicide is ""a complex, very difficult problem that causes all of us to scratch our heads and wonder: how do we stop the next one?"" Last year, at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, two cadets and two members of the staff and faculty killed themselves, said Brig. Gen. Michael S. Linnington, commandant of the cadets. He cited stress from broken relationships and, in one case, a pre-existing mental health condition that academy officials had not known about at the time of admission. None of the four had been deployed to a combat zone. Linnington called the spate of self-directed violence at the school ""troubling and unacceptable"" and said preventive measures there had been beefed up in recent months.","Army Gen. Peter W. Chiarelli: ""We must find ways to relieve some of this stress""

"(CNN) -- At least 38 people have died in mudslides on the Portuguese island of Madeira, which was hit by heavy downpours overnight, an official told CNN on Saturday. Pedro Barbosa, the vice president of the Civil Protection Agency in Madeira, told CNN that an unknown number of people were missing -- perhaps dozens, he said. The mudslides and flooding caused substantial damage to roads and homes in the capital, Funchal, and in Ribeira Brava, which are both on the southern portion of the Atlantic island, which lies about 600 miles southwest of Portugal, Barbosa said. Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates and Interior Minister Rui Pereira arrived on the island on Saturday, according to CNN affiliate Radio e Televisao de Portugal (RTP). Socrates told RTP that ""the situation is under control"" and the government is offering all its support to regional authorities. The country's president, Cavaco Silva, expressed his condolences to the people of Madeira in a televised statement and promised to do everything to help ""during this difficult time."" Pedro Ramos of Dr. Nelio Mendonca Hospital in Funchal, told CNN that 68 wounded people were hospitalized from the mudslides and flooding. Three were critical, he said. The vice president of Madeira's regional government had tallied 68 victims with injuries, according to the official Lusa news agency. The floodwaters overturned cars and knocked down trees, Barbosa said. Authorities have evacuated hundreds of people to military and civil protection facilities in Funchal, he said. Search and rescue teams have been reinforced, but haven't been able to reach every area, according to the Civil Protection Agency. The Portuguese military has dispatched five teams to help with search and rescue efforts, it announced on its Web site. The military is also ready to shelter up to 130 people where 50 people are already staying, it said. Barbosa said weather conditions have substantially improved, with the rains winding down. Madeira, an autonomous region of Portugal, is a popular resort destination. There have been no reports of any dead or missing tourists.

"(CNN) -- A crowd plunders buildings crumbled by last week's earthquake, hauling off water, food, candles and anything else recoverable. Suddenly, a pickup truck hauling a half dozen armed policemen squeals to a halt. The mob scatters as the police officers in military style camouflage fire shots in the air and apprehend a few stragglers, some with a kick or a punch. Such scenes occurred with increased frequency Monday in Port-au-Prince, the devastated Haitian capital, as frustrated survivors resorted to scrounging and looting due to a lack of relief aid. The rising tension raised questions about the ability of the Haitian National Police to maintain order and its tactics in doing so. While the United States is sending thousands of troops to assist in relief efforts, U.S. officials say the Haitian police are responsible for security on the streets, with backing from U.N. peacekeepers. ""The first line of law and order here is, number one, the Haitian police, number two, the U.N. forces,"" U.S. Ambassador Kenneth Merten said Monday. ""The U.S. forces are standing by to provide security as needed."" That seems to be an overwhelming task for the Haitian National Police (HNP), a force of about 9,000 that is the impoverished Caribbean nation's lone security apparatus. Latest updates | Full coverage . National Police Chief Mario Andresol told CNN Monday that the department has been severely affected by the earthquake, with thousands of officers injured, killed or unaccounted for. The Port-au-Prince force of 4,000 has dropped to about 1,500, he said. Complicating matters even further, roughly another 4,000 ""bad guys"" are on the run, Andresol added, after the 95-year-old, badly overcrowded National Penitentiary in the capital collapsed and the inmates escaped. ""Today, we have double work,"" Andresol said, adding that the police department is bring in troops from other parts of the country. ""There are not enough, so we are trying."" Bill Clinton, the former U.S. president who is the U.N. special envoy to Haiti, said Sunday that 40 percent of the Haitian police force has reported for duty since the January 12 temblor. It was unclear how many other police officers died and how many were struggling with the overwhelming hardships from such widespread destruction. First formed in 1995, the civilian police force took over security from a disbanded military known for loyalty to dictators instead of the state, noted Brian Concannon Jr., director of the non-profit Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti. A lack of money and other resources over the years, along with continued instability including a 2004 coup, has left the police force under-funded, under-trained and full of former soldiers prone to operating outside the law, Concannon said. For example, he cited summary executions of suspected criminals as a problem since the 2004 coup, along with police involvement in gangs or other criminal activity. In addition, a dysfunctional judicial system undermines the ability of the police force to deal with chronic crime problems in Port-au-Prince and elsewhere, according to Concannon. High-resolution photos of damage | Google map . Progress has occurred in recent years, as the government simultaneously tried to remove ""bad apples"" from the police force while expanding the number of policemen on the streets, Concannon said. ""Although the HNP's efforts resulted in significantly increased levels of physical security and policing effectiveness, in many cases the HNP could not prevent or respond to gang-related and other societal violence due to an insufficient number of officers and inadequate equipment or training,"" said a 2008 report on Haiti by Concannon's group. Now the earthquake will set back the reform effort. ""There's no doubt the Haitian national police took a significant blow in this disaster,"" U.S. Assistant Secretary of State P.J. Crowley said Monday. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told CNN on Monday that he would ask for an additional 2,000 U.N. troops and 1,500 U.N. police officers to bolster the 3,000 U.N. police and soldiers currently deployed in Port-au-Prince -- among the 9,000 U.N. troops in Haiti. According to Ban, the additional forces would ""help humanitarian assistance be delivered in a safe way."" Concannon said Haitians coping with the disaster will be patient as long as they see aid arriving. He worried that excessive concerns about security was slowing the aid. ""I am afraid you're going to have an escalating spiral where people who were willing to be patient lose their patience due to supplies being withheld for security reasons,"" Concannon said. ""And then that impatience escalates and brings increased security, which further cuts the flow of supplies.""

"(CNN) -- The highest-level talks between the United States and North Korea since President Barack Obama took office unfolded Wednesday in Pyongyang, with a virtual lock-down on information. The top U.S. envoy for North Korea, Stephen Bosworth, is on a three-day visit for meetings to determine whether North Korea will return to six-party talks on its nuclear program. The veteran diplomat is the first senior official from the Obama administration to hold direct talks with Pyongyang. The White House offered no new details about the talks, and North Koreanstate media only acknowledged Bosworth's arrival in a one-line report. North Korea abandoned the six-party talks last April, declaring them ""dead,"" in anger over international criticism of its nuclear and missile tests. But the North also sent signals that it wanted to pursue bilateral talks with the United States instead of a multilateral dialogue. Meanwhile, the North also has cooled its tough rhetoric against the United States. Many are wondering what's behind the North's latest moves. ""The visit gives North Korea a lot of 'face,' a sense of importance,"" said Wenran Jiang, political science professor at the University of Alberta in Canada. Some analysts say North Korea might just be trying to buy time. Earlier reports in Seoul claimed that North Korea is in the final stages of restoring its Yongbyon nuclear plant, which Pyongyang had begun to disable before walking away from the six-party talks in April. Given the secrecy of the North, those reports could not be verified. Analysts say North Korea is also desperate to break out of its diplomatic isolation and ease its economic pain, especially after the U.N. Security Council imposed tougher sanctions on the communist country in response to Pyongyang's nuclear and missile tests earlier this year. Another reason for Pyongyang's moves, analysts say, is neighboring China. When Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao visited Pyongyang in October, China pledged much-needed economic, trade and military aid to its communist ally. During the three-day visit, President Kim Jong Il indicated that North Korea was willing to return to the stalled six-party talks -- on condition that there would be progress in direct talks between North Korea and the United States. China has hosted several rounds of the six-party talks, which bring together the United States, North and South Korea, Japan, Russia and China. The talks aim to negotiate a deal for North Korea to abandon its nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and aid. In the end, Pyongyang wants direct talks with Washington that will eventually lead to diplomatic ties, a peace treaty and economic and trade relations. ""China can only act as a go-between, but in the end, the U.S. and North Korea will have to resolve critical issues between themselves,"" Jiang said. A U.S. State Department official said Bosworth would not carry any new proposals or new initiatives on his visit. ""Our goal here is, of course, the resumption of the six-party talks and to secure North Korea's reaffirmation of the September 2005 joint agreement,"" State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said a few days before Bosworth's trip. He added: ""The complete and verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula ... will be the focus of Ambassador Bosworth's trip to Pyongyang."" Some observers point to a wide difference in the United States and North Korea's negotiating positions. Selig Harrison, an expert on North Korea who has visited the North many times said, ""the U.S. side always says we don't want to buy the same horse twice. Defense Secretary (Robert) Gates actually said that several months ago, meaning that we keep giving North Korea things to get results which we don't get and we feel that we've been cheated and we're making the same deal over and over again. But actually the North Koreans feel that they're the ones who don't get what we have promised."" Bridging their differences, observers say, will not be easy. ""If Bosworth can persuade the North Koreans to return to the six-party talks, all the better,"" said Zha Daojiong, a professor at Peking University in China. ""On the other hand, it will be understandable if he does not. In terms of negotiations, just about all the cards have been put on the table,"" he said. ""It is critically important to be patient with both North Korea and the United States."" Some see the potential for progress. Koh Yu-hwan, an expert on North Korea at Dongguk University in Seoul, South Korea, said there might be options when it comes to North Korea's nuclear weapons. ""It's not that clear-cut,"" he said. ""The Korean War ended with an armistice. Technically the war is not yet over. The North wants nuclear weapons as a deterrent against the U.S. So, if the U.S. offers a security guarantee, pledges that it wouldn't try a 'regime change' and sign a peace treaty with North Korea, the goal of denuclearization is still possible."" Bosworth's visit comes after meeting with U.S. allies. He stopped in Seoul on Monday to brief South Korean officials on his trip to the North. Bonnie Glaser, a North Korea analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, noted that even the North's renewed indication that it might return to the stalled six-party talks is not enough and there still is a long way to go to accomplish the denuclearization goal. After his visit to the North, Bosworth is expected to consult with the other six-party countries before returning to Washington.

"Washington (CNN) -- Democratic congressional leaders Wednesday demanded Republicans join them in condemning a spate of threats and vandalism that has followed Sunday's vote on a sweeping overhaul of the U.S. health care system. More than 10 Democrats have reported trouble since the weekend vote, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told reporters. Windows have been smashed at Democratic offices in at least three states, and federal agents were investigating whether a cut gas line at the home of a Virginia congressman's brother was related to the lawmaker's yes vote. Democracy ""is not about violence,"" Hoyer said at a news conference with South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn, the No. 3 Democrat in the House of Representatives. ""Both of us believe that to remain silent in the face of such activity gives the impression of either condoning or sanctioning such actions,"" added Hoyer, D-Maryland. The top Republican in the House, Minority Leader John Boehner, told reporters that he has urged opponents to demonstrate legally. ""I've made statements that I understand people are angry, but violence and threats are inappropriate and irresponsible,"" the Ohio congressman said. ""If people are angry, they ought to register to vote and get involved in a campaign."" The white-hot rhetoric that dominated the last several months of debate on the historic health care bill culminated in unruly protests by the Tea Party movement at the Capitol over the weekend. Three African-American House Democrats, including civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, reported protesters shouted racial slurs at them and spit at one of them, while Rep. Barney Frank, D-Massachusetts, an openly gay House member, had anti-gay slurs yelled at him. One House member mentioned a map on the Facebook page of former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin during a Wednesday meeting on safety concerns, a Democratic source said. The map shows 20 House Democratic political targets believed to be vulnerable in the upcoming midterm elections -- some have already announced their retirements. Their home districts are marked with cross hairs. Mention of the map brought audible groans to the room, the source said. Republican House members encouraged protesters outside and inside the House gallery, some of whom carried messages like ""Vote no or else"" or ""If Brown won't stop it, a Browning will"" -- a reference to newly elected Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown accompanied by a silhouette of a pistol. Since the vote, an Alabama blogger has launched a ""window war"" against Democrats and has kept a tally of the recent incidents of damage, including ones in upstate New York, Arizona and Kansas. A message left for Michigan Democrat Bart Stupak, whose last-minute decision to support the bill helped give Democrats the votes it needed to pass, warned that ""there are millions of people across the country who wish you ill, and all of those thoughts projected on you will materialize into something that's not very good for you."" Clyburn, who is African-American, said he has received a fax in his office with a picture of a noose drawn on it and had threatening telephone calls at his home. iReport: 'A very dangerous time for Obama' ""We're giving aid and comfort to these people, and this stuff gets ratcheted up,"" Clyburn told CNN. ""We in this Congress have got to come together in a bipartisan way and tamp this foolishness down. It doesn't make sense. That's not what a democracy is all about."" Hoyer told a news conference that ""a significant number, meaning over 10"" lawmakers had reported either threats, vandalism or other incidents. Capitol police officials have briefed House Democrats on reporting suspicious or threatening activity and taking precautions to avoid ""subjecting themselves or their families to physical harm,"" he said. Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-New York, said her Niagara Falls district office had a brick thrown through one of its windows and a message that referred to ""snipers"" was left on one of her campaign offices. In a written statement, she said GOP leaders have been ""fanning the flames with coded rhetoric."" And Maryland Rep. Chris Van Hollen blamed Republicans for encouraging heated rhetoric over the bill. ""There's a real feeling that some of the comments from the Republican leaders and Republicans are not tamping down the fire, they are throwing fuel on the fire. And that is totally inappropriate,"" Van Hollen said. But Boehner, who compared the legislation's passage to ""Armageddon,"" said Democrats had not complained to him that Republicans haven't been quick enough to condemn the threats and vandalism. Clyburn said his wife has forwarded the phone numbers from the calls to law enforcement agencies. Slaughter said federal agents and local authorities were investigating the threat and vandalism at her offices. And in Virginia, Albemarle County fire marshals and the FBI are looking into the slashing of a propane gas line outside the home of Rep. Tom Perriello's brother, the congressman's office said. A Perriello aide told CNN that a line to the propane tank on the brother's gas grill had been severed after the brother's home address was posted online by a Tea Party activist. Lee Catlin, a spokesman for the fire marshal's office, said the incident ""did not involve an immediate threat to occupants of the residence"" but would disclose no details. The county joined the investigation late Tuesday after a request from the FBI, Caitlin said. ""Officials are taking the incident very seriously and conducting a vigorous investigation,"" he said. Conservative talk show host Glenn Beck told his radio audience Monday that Democrats who supported the bill would be remembered as ""an enemy of the republic"" and ""an enemy to the Constitution."" But he urged viewers of his Fox News television show Wednesday to avoid violence, because ""radical"" supporters of the Obama administration are counting on such attacks to discredit their opposition, he said. ""Not only is it completely nuts and wrong, it's exactly what they want,"" Beck said. He told viewers, ""They are begging for it. You are being set up."" But in Kansas, Democrats in Wichita are seeking to raise money over a brick thrown through the window of the party headquarters. ""At first, we thought our office was just the object of a random act of bitter violence, but now we know that's not the case,"" said the Sedgewick County Democratic Party's Web site. ""This attack was instigated, encouraged and directed by an ultra-right wing blogger and similar events occurred all over the country."" The Web site item asked for donations to ""help us get back to work.""

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Anger boiled over on the streets of Haiti's capital Tuesday -- not just from residents who have gone a week without food and water, but from the people who are supposed to be providing it. Relief workers say help is not reaching many of the 2 million residents in Port-au-Prince who need aid, because those who are supposed to be coordinating the efforts are inept. ""It's terrible,"" said Eric Klein, head of disaster-relief agency CAN-DO. ""There's got to be coordination."" Medical aid is particularly needed, Klein and others said. ""There are medical supplies just sitting at the frigging airport,"" Klein said while sitting in the cab of a 1,200-gallon water truck near the heavily damaged presidential palace. Klein and two Haitian businessmen had just delivered free water to a nearby town. iReport: Search list of the missing and the found . It's not just water and food that are not making it to residents. A 20-member French medical and rescue team that arrived Sunday in Port-au-Prince finally reached their aid site at Sylvio Cator Stadium two days later. ""We did not have trucks or gasoline to get here,"" Bruno Besson, a co-team leader, said Tuesday. Full coverage    l     Twitter updates . The group had been ready since last Wednesday, one day after the earthquake, but had to sit at the airport in France for two days because there was no plane available to take them, said a frustrated Oustalet Jean-Philippe, the other co-leader for Secouristes Sans Frontieres. He blamed the United Nations. Others say the United States, which is spearheading the relief effort, is at fault. High-resolution images of damage . The Geneva, Switzerland-based Doctors Without Borders complained this weekend that U.S. air traffic controllers in charge of the Aeroport International Toussaint Louverture were diverting aircraft carrying medical supplies and other humanitarian aid. U.S. military flights were getting top priority, the doctors group said. Alain Joyandet, the French minister in charge of humanitarian aid, said Monday that the U.S. military build-up was hindering relief efforts. Some media reported that Joyandet admitted becoming involved in a tussle in the airport's control tower over the flight plan for a French evacuation mission. U.S. officials said they would start giving priority to humanitarian flights over military landings and takeoffs, reports said. About 200 flights a day are taking off and landing at the one-runway airport each day, said Army Major Gen. Daniel B. Allyn, deputy commander of the joint task force providing relief. With the seaport closed by earthquake damage, hundreds of tons of aid sit waiting at the airport, the only port of entry. U.S. military helicopters routinely load the cargo at a grassy landing zone between the runway and a crowded tarmac and airlift it to at least eight distribution points throughout the city. Some aid workers say a lack of trucks and fuel makes it difficult to transport the cargo on land. Security is also a concern. The military will open two other airports within the next two days, Allyn said Tuesday. One will be about 25 miles from Port-au-Prince, while the other will be in the adjacent Dominican Republic. The U.S. military has 2,000 troops on the ground and will increase that level to 10,000 in the next few weeks, the general said. The military has distributed 400,000 bottles of water and 300,000 meals since the earthquake, Allyn added. But many aid workers -- or those who would like to help -- find themselves increasingly frustrated. Gueldie Laraque and nine other South Florida nurses took vacation time to travel to Haiti to help and arrived Sunday. Two days later, they still couldn't find where to go. Three of them had finally gotten a ride from a friend of a friend Tuesday while they looked for a place that needed their services. ""We just get can't around,"" said Laraque, an ICU registered nurse. ""We're getting very frustrated."" Her colleague, Luzus Nortelus, also voiced her exasperation. ""We're trying to find out what to do,"" she said. ""What do they need?"" At Sylvio Cator Stadium, where hundreds of displaced Haitian families have set up camp, a team of Israeli doctors has treated about 500 patients in the past three days. The French medical team's arrival was particularly welcomed. ""This is a dream come true,"" said Alan Schneider, director of the B'Nai B'rith World Center in Jerusalem. ""It's been a harrowing three days."" The Israeli team consists of two doctors and seven nurses. They were joined by the five doctors, four paramedics, 11 rescuers and four dogs on the French team.","Twenty-member French team that arrived Sunday reaches aid site two days later .

"London, England (CNN) -- The debut album by New York rock band The Strokes has been named ""album of the decade"" by influential British music magazine, NME. Released in 2001, ""Is This It"" topped the 100 Greatest Albums Of The Decade list compiled by a panel of musicians, producers, writers and record label bosses, according to NME.com. The Libertines' 2002 debut ""Up the Bracket"" was runner-up, with Primal Scream's ""XTRMNTR"" from 2000 in third spot. The Strokes formed in 1999 with a line-up that includes lead vocalist Julian Casablancas, guitarists Nick Valensi and Albert Hammond, Jr., bassist Nikolai Fraiture, and drummer Fabrizio Moretti. Fans had to wait two years before ""Is This It"" was finally released to critical acclaim, with hits such as ""Last Night"" and ""Hard to Explain"" underlining their Velvet Underground-inspired garage rock sound. However, the album fared better among British fans, reaching number two in the charts compared to 33 in the United States. The band's second album, ""Room On Fire"", was released in 2003 and again reached number two in the British charts with singles including ""12:51"" and ""Reptilia."" But their third album, ""First Impressions of Earth"", gave the band its first number one success, when it snatched top spot in Britain in 2006. It also reached the hitherto unknown heights of number four across the Atlantic. On hearing about the NME accolade, frontman Casablancas told the BBC: ""It's totally crazy! I thought it was great when I heard. ""But does it mean it's a good musical decade or a bad musical decade?

The crooner, who many affectionately knew as just ""Teddy,"" started in music with a group called the Cadillacs in the late 1960s and was still with the group when it merged with Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes, according to his official Web site. He started as a drummer, but soon began to sing lead after the group heard his powerful voice. In 1972, Pendergrass's baritone could be heard on the classic Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes song ""If You Don't Know Me by Now."" The song became a No. 1 hit across the country and led Pendergrass to many other hits and accolades. After going solo, Pendergrass received several Grammy nominations, Billboard's 1977 Pop Album New Artist Award and an American Music Award for best R&B performer of 1978, Barbaris said.

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN)  -- Five people were rescued Sunday from the rubble of a grocery store, officials told CNN, 24 hours after the effort to reach them began. Three of the people trapped in the ruins of the Caribbean Supermarket -- a man, a 13-year-old girl and a 50-year-old American woman -- were rescued earlier in the day by a joint New York fire and police department search and rescue team. A Creole-speaking man and woman were rescued late Sunday night by a team from Miami, Florida, and a Turkish team. The man came out first, picking his head up off the stretcher carried by his rescuers and giving the thumbs-up sign. He said he had been eating peanut butter and jelly from the store to survive. The effort was dealt a temporary setback Sunday afternoon when the floor over rescuers' heads -- described as a concrete slab -- buckled as they were working in a 3-foot-high area, said Lt. Charles McDermott, spokesman for Florida Task Force 2. Debris rained down on the rescue workers as they ran outside of the building. They stood outside and embraced each other as they called roll to make sure everyone had escaped. Work was temporarily suspended as rescuers evaluated whether they should reinforce the floor or work in a different area, McDermott said. Rescue personnel worked throughout Saturday night and Sunday to free the people, Capt. Joe Zahralban of the Florida search team said, at times crawling through spaces that were so tight they could only take half a breath. Zahralban had the opportunity to tell the rescued American woman's sister that she is alive. ""She dropped to her knees and thanked us,"" he said. The Florida rescuers also called the woman's son, who lives in Pembroke Pines, Florida. ""After we told him, he went silent for a moment,"" Zahralban said. Get the latest developments on Haiti . The man and teenage girl found alive earlier in the day were taken to a U.N. hospital at Port-au-Prince's airport, where the girl, about 13, was treated for leg injuries and the man treated for undetermined injuries. They are believed to be Haitian nationals, officials said. As of Sunday, more than 60 people had been rescued alive by rescue teams from the United States and other nations, Tim Callaghan of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) told reporters. Americans have rescued about 30 of those, he said. A U.N. search and rescue team freed one of its own, Jens Christensen of Denmark, from the rubble of the collapsed mission headquarters Sunday where at least 37 people have been confirmed dead. He told his rescuers that others were still alive, saying he had heard tapping nearby, but not since Friday. Those trapped in the supermarket had been living off the store's inventory of food and water, authorities said. ""If I was going to be trapped for five days in the dark,"" Zahralban said, ""one of the best places to be is in a supermarket surrounded by food."" Separately, other members of the New York team rescued a 55-year-old man trapped in the rubble of a four-story building in Port-au-Prince. They used a rescue camera to locate the man, and then a paramedic climbed into a narrow space with him and started an intravenous fluid line to combat the man's dehydration as rescuers used jackhammers and cutting tools to free him. Full coverage of the earthquake in Haiti . The man had been trapped since Tuesday, the NYPD said in a statement. He was suffering from dehydration but otherwise not seriously injured. Other rescues took place as well. An Israel Defense Forces medical and rescue team said Sunday it had rescued a Haitian government worker Saturday after he was trapped for 125 hours in the rubble of a customs office. After the rescue, which lasted eight hours, he was taken in ""moderate condition"" to an IDF hospital. It was the first live rescue by IDF, according to a statement. Also Saturday, a team with Los Angeles County Search and Rescue answered the desperate, but futile, pleas of a mother who believed her young daughter was trapped alive beneath the rubble of a day care center in downtown Port-au-Prince. Despite the distinct sounds of tapping from within the crushed concrete, the rescue effort turned into a recovery operation eight hours after it began when crews failed to get further responses from whoever was trapped inside. Elsewhere in the capital, rescue crews responded to a text message from a 30-year-old woman beneath the ruins of the collapsed bank where she worked. Dogs picked up the scent of survivors within the rubble several times, but by early Sunday, rescue crews hadn't seen or heard anything with high-tech cameras and listening devices. Also rescued Saturday: a 2-month-old baby in critical condition with injuries that included broken ribs. Rescue personnel worried she could contract a deadly case of pneumonia and doctors rushed her to the airport where she was evacuated to Jackson Memorial Hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. CNN's Anderson Cooper, Susan Candiotti, Rich Phillips and Mary Lucas contributed to this report.","Three people trapped in the ruins of the Caribbean Supermarket rescued earlier .

"(CNN) -- A 47-year-old Virginia man was charged Monday with interfering with a flight crew during a flight last week in which he allegedly became intoxicated and unruly, leading authorities to scramble fighter jets and the pilot to make an emergency landing. The incident occurred Friday when Muhammad Abu Tahir, a Pakistani national and lawful permanent U.S. resident of Glen Allen, Virginia, was aboard AirTran Airways Flight 39 from Atlanta, Georgia, to San Francisco, California. During the flight, a flight attendant served Tahir, seated in coach, three airplane-serving-sized bottles of wine, then refused to serve him more, according to a two-page affidavit filed Monday by the FBI. He appealed to the senior flight attendant, who granted him a fourth, then a fifth bottle, both of which he downed quickly, it said. Tahir then went to a bathroom in the rear of the plane and closed the door, opening it a few minutes later and placing his shoes and socks outside the door, then retreating back inside, the affidavit said. ""A short time later, Tahir again opened the lavatory door revealing that he was shaving with no shirt on,"" it added. When a flight attendant knocked on the door and encouraged him to leave the bathroom so others could use it, Tahir refused ""and started yelling at the flight attendant that he was being disrespected,"" it said. Notified of the passenger's behavior, the captain advised the senior flight attendant to enlist the help of a passenger to stand outside the lavatory in case help was needed, it said. But Tahir continued yelling and refused to obey the crew, at one point grabbing the senior flight attendant by her arms and hands, releasing her only after a passenger interceded, the affidavit said. By this time, a fire extinguisher had been carried to the rear of the plane for possible use against the man and a beverage cart was repositioned to contain Tahir, according to the affidavit . While Tahir remained inside the lavatory, the pilot made an emergency landing in Colorado Springs, Colorado, where police officers took Tahir to the El Paso County Jail, where he remained Monday. Tahir told the FBI that he felt he was being disrespected when the flight attendants denied his request for food, which was being served in business class, the affidavit said. The charges Tahir faces will be read Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Denver and a detention hearing and preliminary hearing are to be scheduled for later in the week. ""It is crucial that the flying public obey the commands of the flight crew,"" said U.S. Attorney David Gaouette. If convicted, Tahir faces up to 20 years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine, or both, as well as restitution to the airline. The incident was the second in three days in which North American Aerospace Defense Command fighter jets were scrambled in response to a passenger deemed disruptive. On Wednesday, NORAD escorted a Hawaii-bound plane back to its origination city of Portland, Oregon, after a passenger gave a flight attendant a note that was interpreted as being threatening. The passenger, Joseph Hedlund Johnson, 56, told the FBI he hadn't intended to scare anyone with the note, which began, ""I thought I was going to die,"" and referenced the television show ""Gilligan's Island.""","47-year-old Virginia man charged with interfering with a flight crew .

"(CNN) -- Three days after a consumers' group called for a meat boycott, the head of Argentina's beef industry said Thursday prices will fall by week's end. Gustavo Valsangiacomo, president of the Argentina Beef Industry Union, declined to say the boycott was responsible for the price drop. But he acknowledged that demand for beef is falling, the official Telam news agency said. ""There are a sum of factors,"" Valsangiacomo told Telam. ""I don't want to take importance away from the boycott, but it will be analyzed by the end of the week. Nonetheless, we undoubtedly believe that prices reached a point that the public cannot and does not want to accept."" On Monday, an Argentinean consumer group called for a one-week beef boycott in an attempt to lower prices in a nation that eats more beef than anywhere else in the world. The price of beef has increased 40 percent to 50 percent since December, said the Association of Free Consumers, which called for the boycott. The group cited success in a similar recent boycott of tomatoes, which also had risen in price. Within a few days of the tomato boycott, prices dropped, the consumer organization said. Valsangiacomo said the beef industry had reached a particular point in which cattle growers have cheap feed but have tried to maximize their profits. ""There has to be an equilibrium between their costs and what consumers are paying,"" the industry chief said. Argentina -- a nation of nearly 41 million residents and 51 million head of cattle in 2007, the latest year comparison figures are available -- has faced a crisis as cattle supplies have dipped to their lowest levels in 45 years, according to the Argentina Farm Federation. The Association of Free Consumers cites three possible reasons for the decline in cattle stock: a significant increase in the number of slaughtered livestock; an acceleration in the cultivation of soy, with more than 10 million hectares (24.7 million acres) converted from livestock to soy production; and more Argentineans buying beef. Drought also has decreased the size of available pasture land. Argentineans eat more beef than any other nation in the world -- 68 kilograms (150 lbs) per person annually, the Farm Federation said. Despite the high consumption, that's a significant decrease from the 80 kilograms (176 lbs) per person per year in the 1970s, the farmers' group said. Argentinean beef is considered among the best in the world, and the nation is the third-largest exporter in the world, behind Brazil and Australia. But the drastic decline in beef cattle has led some Argentineans to worry the nation eventually could have to import beef to keep up with the high demand.","Consumer group called for one-week beef boycott to try to lower prices .

"(Sunset) -- Yes, I admit this wasn't the first time I'd forgotten an important event. Let's not get hung up on that. What's important is that I quickly and admirably redeemed myself. For a refreshing walk, try a sliver of the Laguna Beach coastline, about 50 miles south of Los Angeles. Once the florist came to deliver the white dendrobium (I collect orchids) and I read the note -- ""Happy Anniversary. Love, J"" -- I immediately jumped into action: In less than an hour, I'm driving my wife, Jan, to Laguna Beach, our favorite seaside village. It is a place blessedly stocked with eateries where a guy can get noteworthy huevos rancheros while his beloved browses chic shops along Ocean and Forest Avenues for bejeweled sandals during winter sales. Laguna Beach also happens to be where we spent a few days on our honeymoon years ago, so I have that going for me. Short of hiring a helicopter, there are only two ways to get to this gallery-filled artist colony, either along Orange County's Coast Highway or down eucalyptus-laden Laguna Canyon Road, which curves like a riverbed, flowing down to the sea from the base of steep hills dotted with aerie bright-white homes that look like seagulls perched on precipices. As we roll into town just before sunset, we feel like we're dropping into a box canyon with the Pacific Ocean as its only outlet, making the village feel cozy and isolated, particularly in the fall and winter months when the crowds thin out. A chilly breeze brings the faint smell of menthol (the canyon's eucalyptus trees) and something sweet, like saltwater taffy, perhaps from one of the candy stores. Long sheets of purplish orange clouds scatter like flaming blankets across the sky, suffusing the ocean, the sky, even Jan's face with a fireside glow. ""This is such a special treat,"" she says. ""I can't believe you thought of it. By the way, where are we staying?"" Fortunately, I'm prepared for this question. I've been turning it over in my head from the moment we left home. I was thinking we could try to get a room at the hotel where we'd spent three nights on our honeymoon, even though it wasn't that great. But then my spousal guilt kicks in, so I decide to bite the bullet and go all out at Montage Laguna Beach resort and spa: California Craftsman architecture. Plein air art lining lobby walls. Feather-top beds. Soaking tubs for two. Views of Laguna's beaches. Jaw-dropping room rates. That sort of thing. Beach romance . When we get up the next morning, the sun warming up the room, Jan and I both notice the quiet. With doors open wide to the Pacific, we hear the chest-thumping crash of the waves, the raspy bark of sea lions, the singsongy entreaty of a distant jogger calling his dog back from a run on the beach. I say we love the quiet, then I talk about the sounds. But it's different. In summer, beach sounds can be cacophonous. In fall and winter, there's mostly the wind and waves and sea life. We love the communal feel of the town at this time of year, when locals, who seem to hibernate during the hot months, suddenly reappear to reclaim their favorite eateries and bars. One morning we laze about Zinc Cafe on boutique-lined Ocean Avenue, reading the paper while digging into massive bowls of oatmeal mixed with dried cherries and nuts and surreptitiously listening to the breezy conversation around us -- like that of the young woman at the next table who's trying to convince a friend to join her in a laughter-yoga workshop on the beach. ""At first you just feel really stupid going hee-hee-hee, haw-haw-haw, but then you really do start laughing and it ... it's such a release,"" she says. ""What the heck is laughter yoga?"" I lean over and whisper to Jan. She raises her eyebrows, perplexed, and we both try hard not to laugh. Fishing for adventure . For exercise, we hike down from Coast Highway to Victoria Beach, a secluded cove hardly anyone goes to, particularly off-season. I take moody black-and-white photos of Jan on a sea-worn rock in front of an odd little castle turret on the beach, a tower built almost 80 years ago by an early inhabitant who was looking to camouflage spiraling stairs to his house -- long gone -- on the bluff above us. We do a lot of beach walking, particularly just before cocktail hour in the late afternoon. Strolling down Treasure Island beach, we come across couples cozy on their blankets, and chilled surf fishermen slapping their hands together while keeping a watchful eye on their poles. That night we enjoy dinner at Sapphire Laguna restaurant, where the old Pottery Shack, a local landmark, sat for 60 years. We huddle around a firepit on the patio, looking over the roofs of shops along the highway to where the sun is dipping into the dark ocean, and nosh on homemade rosemary and sea-salt potato chips while quaffing Chimay Blue dark ale. And while it isn't exactly my favorite adventure, in the spirit of the weekend I join Jan one afternoon while she pokes around the shops of Laguna Village, perched on a bluff above the ocean, trying not to act too annoyed when she insists I sniff herbal-scented candles or try on goofy-looking leather hats, the type worn by guys with walrus mustaches and jackets with fringe. In short, we do everything and nothing at all, which is really the best thing about Laguna at this time of year. And I think Jan appreciated my efforts. Which may explain why she seems completely unruffled when I confess that I had, indeed, forgotten our anniversary. ""Of course you did,"" she says as we head back home. ""Why do you think I sent the orchid?"" A more cynical man might suspect that she'd engineered the whole weekend herself. But what are the odds of that? Getting there .

"(CNN) -- Venus Williams claimed the 42nd title of her glittering career as she successfully defended her Dubai Tennis Championship crown on Saturday. The American defeated fourth seed Victoria Azarenka of Belarus 6-3 7-5 in the final, having also won their only previous encounter at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. The victory lifted Williams into 11th place on the all-time list, moving her one title ahead of the recently-returned Justine Henin to make her the most successful player currently active on the WTA Tour. The former world No. 1, seeded third in the absence of her top-ranked younger sister Serena and No. 2 Dinara Safina, won the opening set in controversial circumstances with the only break after using the Hawkeye system to challenge a line call on Azarenka's second serve at 3-2. The 29-year-old Williams romped to a 2-0 lead in the second set, but Australian Open quarterfinalist Azarenka leveled at 3-3 and games went with serve until 5-5. Williams broke then with a forehand passing shot, highlighting the extra power she said had given her an edge. ""Obviously, my serve is a big advantage for me,"" she told the tournament's official Web site. ""I think I get a lot of balls back. I think off the ground she's very strong and consistent, but I think I'm probably a little stronger than her, so that helps me to control the point. ""I think she does everything well, but there's a few things, obviously the strength that helps me."" The 20-year-old Azarenka has now lost five of her eight WTA Tour finals. ""It's not about power. It's more about precision that she was making it on the lines close to the lines,"" Azarenka said. ""Venus came off with some big shots, and, you know, I think overall the game was really good. ""Very high quality of tennis from both of us. Just, you know, a little bit of bad luck on a few balls. But I'm proud of what I did today."" Meanwhile, top seed Maria Sharapova claimed her 21st career title and her first of this year after thrashing Sophia Arvidsson 6-2 6-1 in the final of the Cellular South Cup in Memphis on Saturday. The Russian made short work of the 102-ranked Swede, who reached the final after coming through qualifying rounds but won the tournament four years ago. The 22-year-old Sharapova won her fifth consecutive match in straight sets, claiming her first title since triumphing in Tokyo in October last year as she continues her rehabilitation from long-term shoulder problems.","Venus Williams claims 42nd title of her career, defending Dubai Tennis Championship crown .

"(CNN) -- WBO welterweight champion Miguel Cotto will take a one-pound advantage over Filipino Manny Pacquiao into Saturday night's superfight in Las Vegas. Puerto Rico's Cotto weighed in at 145 pounds in front a 5,000 strong crowd at the MGM Grand Arena, with Pacquiao tipping the scales at 144 pounds. Pacquiao is bidding for a world title at a fifth different weight and was backed by vociferous supporters ahead of the eagerly-anticipated bout. He looked relaxed and smiled as he stripped to his boxer shorts, while Cotto looked more intense. There was a brief, angry exchange between Pacquiao's trainer Freddie Roach and the Cotto camp after the champion got off the scales but order was quickly restored and both fighters addressed the crowd in their native languages. Pacquiao, who is rated the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world by many boxing experts, has previously won recognized belts at fly, super-bantam, super-feather and lightweight during his remarkable career. It is his first fight since a stunning knockout of Britain's Ricky Hatton sixth months ago at the same venue. Pacquiao, who's won 49 fights, lost 3 and drawn 2, is being lined up for a money spinning fight with American Floyd Mayweather, but first must get past the determined Cotto, who has held a world title every year since 2004. Pacquiao is rated as favorite by Las Vegas oddsmakers, but Cotto has just one defeat in 35 fights with 27 knockouts.","Miguel Cotto has one-pound weight advantage over Manny Pacquiao for big fight in Las Vegas .

"WARSAW, Poland (CNN) -- In Poland, it's polite to bring flowers when you visit someone's home, so there's a flower shop on virtually every street corner in Warsaw. Crowds flock to Rynek Starego Miasta, Warsaw's Old Town Market Place. But the city is now realizing flower power on a bigger scale. There are buds and blooms adding color all over the capital, from the quaint Old Town to the bustling city center to the massive concrete apartment blocks left over from the communist era. It's Warsaw in bloom, in many ways: A city thriving, growing and blossoming six decades after much of it was destroyed during World War II and almost 20 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union brought many radical economic and social changes. Modern Warsaw is a mix of shiny new skyscrapers, tree-lined boulevards, ornate prewar buildings and somber concrete communist relics. Hamburger joints and pizzerias compete for customers with restaurants offering traditional Polish fare like pierogi. Expensive new cars share the road with crowded buses and trams. Traffic jams frustrate drivers throughout the day. But it's the older Warsaw -- faithfully restored and full of churches, palaces and parks -- that seems to attract the most visitors.  See more photos of Warsaw's places and people » . To get a feel for the city that was known as the Paris of Eastern Europe before World War II, stroll down Nowy Świat Street, lined with restaurants, cafes, bookstores and small shops. It's part of what's known as Warsaw's Królewski Trakt, or Royal Route. On a recent visit, the music of Frederic Chopin wafted down from an open window of one of the elegant apartments occupying the upper floors. The street is also home to a sweet Warsaw tradition. Blikle, one of the city's best-known confectioners, has been serving up cakes and pastries since 1869. It's probably most famous for perfecting the Polish version of the donut: Fist-sized balls of sweet, fragrant yeast dough fried until they're golden-brown and covered with icing. But it's what's inside that gives them their unique taste: A filling of preserves made from pureed rose petals and sugar. They're best when they're still warm, when it's especially hard to eat just one. Bustling Nowy Świat Street flows into elegant Krakowskie Przedmieście Street as you near the Old Town, Stare Miasto. Follow the crowds to the Royal Castle and the column bearing the statue of Poland's King Zygmunt III, first erected in 1644. Cobblestone streets lead to the heart of the district: Rynek Starego Miasta, the Old Town Market Place, where visitors are surrounded by picturesque pastel blue, pink and yellow buildings capped by red-shingled roofs and where the mood is as merry as the colors. Sit down for lunch at an outdoor cafe, buy an amber necklace at one of the shops lining the square, have your caricature painted by artists displaying their work, or just feed the pigeons. No matter the activity, it's a great place to relax and people watch. This historic center of Warsaw -- which Nazi troops almost completely destroyed in 1944 and which was carefully rebuilt after the war -- is designated as a World Heritage site by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. ""It is an outstanding example of a near-total reconstruction of a span of history covering the 13th to the 20th century,"" UNESCO says. To get away from the crowds, return to the Royal Route and head towards the Aleje Ujazdowskie, a grand boulevard lined with embassies. It's here that you'll find the entrances to Warsaw's Łazienki Park, once the summer residence of Poland's royalty. Today, it's almost 200 acres of calm in the middle of the city and the perfect place for a stroll on wide alleyways surrounded by lush green trees and manicured lawns. The serene Pałac na Wyspie, Palace on the Isle, is one of several historic must-see sites in the park. Among the many other pleasures: Watching the playful red squirrels roaming in the grass and taking in the colorful plumage of the peacocks strolling the grounds. Nearby, another Warsaw tradition awaits. For decades, the statue of Frederic Chopin has drawn music lovers and pianists for outdoor concerts of the Polish composer's works. They're held each summer underneath the monument as crowds gather in the surrounding rose garden that also serves as an auditorium. But any stroll through Warsaw is also a walk through the city's tragic history. ""In this spot, the Nazis shot to death 30 Poles,"" a stone tablet reads on Nowy Świat Street. There are many such plaques across the capital. Monuments pay tribute to the many thousands killed during the Warsaw Uprising -- a civilian struggle to free the city from German occupation in 1944. Some of the buildings that survived World War II still have visible bullet holes in their façades. They're all unforgettable reminders of the city's painful past and how much it has overcome. ""Fall in love with Warsaw,"" the capital invites visitors in a slogan printed on posters all over town. It's not hard to do.

"Washington (CNN) -- In the wake of the Christmas Day attempt to blow up a U.S. airliner, most Americans remain confident the Obama administration can protect the country from terrorism, according to a new national poll. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Monday also indicates the vast majority of Americans believe that full-body scanners should be used in airports across the country. Nearly two-thirds of people questioned in the poll said they have a moderate or great deal of confidence in the administration to protect the public from future terrorist attacks, up 2 percentage points from August. Thirty-five percent said they have not much or no confidence, down 1 percentage point from August. Read the full poll results (PDF) A number of Republicans have criticized President Obama over his handling of the attempted bombing of Northwest Airlines Flight 253 from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Detroit, Michigan. But according to the survey, 57 percent approve of the way Obama has responded, while 39 percent disapprove of how he handled the situation. ""Only a third of Republicans have a positive view of Obama on this matter, but the key for the administration is the 55 percent of independents who approve of how the president responded to the incident on Christmas Day,"" said Keating Holland, CNN's polling director. The poll also indicates no increase in overall concern about terrorism. ""In October, about a third said they were worried that a family member would become a victim of terrorism, and that number is unchanged in the wake of the attempted attack in December,"" Holland said. ""The public seems to react calmly to individual incidents, possibly because most Americans believe that the government cannot prevent every single terrorist plot from occurring."" Six in 10 said terrorists always will find a way to launch an attack, no matter what the government does, he added -- identical to the number who felt that way during the Bush administration. The poll indicates a majority, 57 percent, think suspect Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab should be tried in military court and not a civilian criminal court. Forty-two percent back handling the case in civilian court. According to the survey, Americans also are split on whether heads should roll as a result of the attempted bombing of the airliner. Forty-six percent questioned feel that top officials in the federal agencies responsible for handling the issue of terrorism should be fired, while 51 percent said no. The poll indicates that nearly eight in 10 believe full-body scanners should be used in U.S. airports, while 15 percent said they would refuse to go through one of the machines if asked to do so. ""Most Americans don't see full-body scanners as a health risk, and more than seven in 10 say they would be unconcerned if asked to go through one at an airport,"" Holland said. ""Women in particular seem to prefer the idea of a full-body scanner to being frisked by a security guard, even when the question makes clear that the guard doing the manual pat-down would also be a woman."" The CNN/Opinion Research poll was conducted Friday through Sunday, with 1,021 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points. CNN deputy political director Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","Nearly two-thirds have moderate or great deal of confidence in president's handling of terrorism .

"(CNN) -- The raging wildfires that killed hundreds of Australians earlier this year could not kill Sam the Koala. The plight of Sam the Koala became a huge hit on video-sharing Web site YouTube. But an illness endemic in the country's koala population did. Sam, the 4-year-old Koala who became famous after he was injured and rescued from the historic wildfires, died Thursday, an Australian wildlife shelter said. ""It is with great sadness today that TressCox Lawyers on behalf of the Southern Ash Wildlife Shelter announce that Sam the Koala has lost her latest fight for survival,"" the shelter said in a statement. ""Sam became a symbol of hope and determination across the nation for both survivors of the black Saturday bush fires and all those that fought and lent support throughout the community."" Sam was catapulted into fame in February when a photograph surfaced showing a firefighter, marked with soot, holding her injured paw and pouring water into her mouth. As firefighters continued to battle the brush fires that killed more than 200 people and torched 2,000 homes, Sam was taken to Southern Ash Wildlife Shelter to heal from burns on her paws. Reporters flocked to the wildlife shelter to do update stories on Sam. One story by Australian local television revealed that Sam, short for Samantha, had quickly gained a boyfriend, a Koala named Bob. Her paws healed but soon she developed ovarian cysts associated with chlamydia, an ailment that affects 50 percent of Australia's koala population, the shelter said. ""Sam had severe changes in her urinary and reproductive tract that was non-operable and unfortunately had to put Sam to sleep,"" the statement said. ""The changes were consistent with the Chlamydia infection. It was so severe that there was no possible way to be able to manage her pain.""","Sam pictured in photograph being nursed by a firefighter during February fires .

"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- Five Florida men convicted of plotting terrorist acts with al Qaeda were sentenced Friday to long prison terms, the Department of Justice announced. Seven suspects were arrested in June 2006 for allegedly conspiring to blow up buildings, including the 110-story Sears Tower, the nation's tallest building, in Chicago, Illinois; the FBI's Miami office and others. Five were convicted in May, their third trial after juries failed to reach a verdict on two previous attempts. The sixth was found not guilty. A seventh was found not guilty earlier. The suspected ringleader, Narseal Batiste, 35, was sentenced to 13½ years in prison plus 35 years of supervision after his release. He was the only defendant found guilty earlier this year of all four conspiracy charges, including conspiring to incite a rebellion against the United States, supplying materials to a terror organization and terrorists, and conspiring to destroy buildings with explosives. Another defendant, Patrick Abraham, 30, was sentenced to 9 years, 4-and-a-half months in prison, to be followed by 15 years of supervision. He was convicted of two counts involving supplying materials to terrorists and terror groups, and of conspiring to destroy buildings with explosives. Stanley Grant Phanor, 34, Burson Augustin, 24, and Rotschild Augustine, 26, were convicted of supplying materials to terrorists but acquitted of the other charges. Phanor got eight years, Augustin got six and Augustine seven. All will be supervised for 10 to 15 years after release. The sixth defendant, Naudimer Herrera, 25, was acquitted on all four counts. The prosecution of the men ""helped make our community safer by rooting out nascent terrorists before they could carry out their threats,"" Acting U.S. Attorney Jeffrey H. Sloman of the Southern District of Florida said in a statement announcing the sentences Friday. Lawyers for two of the men said they intended to appeal when the verdict was announced in May. The terror trial in Miami was the third held for the defendants, a group of homeless men initially known as the ""Liberty City 7,"" for the Miami neighborhood where authorities say they operated. In the first trial, a mistrial was declared after nine days of deliberations in December 2007, although a seventh defendant was acquitted. The jury in the second trial deadlocked in April 2008 after deliberating for 13 days. The first two juries could not determine whether the defendants were seriously plotting with al Qaeda -- as the prosecutors alleged -- or if they were simply struggling young men who were looking to con an FBI informant out of money, as the defense alleged. Authorities have said the men did not have explosives or weapons and that their plans appeared ""more aspirational than operational."" The investigation began after an Arabic speaker contacted authorities and said Batiste approached him about waging ""jihad"" in the United States. Investigators then planted among the group an undercover informant, who claimed to be an al Qaeda member who helped plan the attack on the USS Cole in 2000. A federal raid on the group's Liberty City warehouse in 2006 revealed a receipt for purchase of a gun, as well as ammunition, marijuana, two credit cards, 10 euros, three machetes, two swords, an ax, uniforms and a flight suit. On a surveillance videotape played during trial, Batiste could be heard saying he was ""very grateful"" to Osama bin Laden and ""loved"" the al Qaeda leader's work. He also said he respected bin Laden and wanted to meet him someday. In other excerpts, Batiste told the informant his people needed training, and they discussed going to Chicago because the city has underground trains and tunnels. CNN's John Couwels contributed to this report.","Trial was the third for defendants, homeless men initially known as ""Liberty City 7""
